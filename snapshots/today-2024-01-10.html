The rain is tapering off, but the worst may be yet to come. As National
Weather Service meteorologist Patrick Wilson
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/us/storm-east-coast-flooding.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
The New York Times: “The worst time for flooding is right after the rain
stops.” It takes time for the water dumped by a storm to travel down
from mountains and make its way into smaller streams and rivers, Wilson
said. But when it does, those waterways can flood.

moderate to major river flooding could inundate parts of the

<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I spend a lot of time thinking about words, and when I hear a phrase
that seems wrong to me, I’ll work on it until I figure out why it seems
wrong and what would be a better way to express the actual idea.
</p>
<p>
That said, I don’t think Trump tried to “overturn an election.”
</p>
<p>
More accurately, he tried to overthrow the government.
</p>
<p>
Why I say that:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Overturn could be something you do legitimately. If you are convicted of
a crime, you could appeal it, be exonerated, and the correct verb would
be overturn. Overturn doesn’t convey the illegitimacy of what Trump
tried to do. The criminality of it. The abhorrence of it, by American
values. He tried to “overturn” our most sacred ritual, the transfer of
power from one person to another, based on the vote of the people.
Overthrow is a much better word for what was done.
</li>
<li>
But can you overthrow an election and is that what Trump tried to do? No
and no. When you commit a crime, as he surely did, say for example
killing someone criminally, we don’t say they tried to illegally use a
weapon, that’s too technical, we say they’re “accused of murder.” We
focus on the consequences. There are lots of ways to illegally use a
weapon, what matters is the intended result.
</li>
<li>
Does the United States always have a government? I’d argue yes it does.
There is always exactly one president, at all times, in all
circumstances. It has at times been
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUKW0fL-OqY">called</a> into
question.
</li>
<li>
On January 20, 2021, we had an actual peaceful transfer of power when
Joe Biden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvbQR887W0">took the
oath</a>, but the transfer actually took place before he took the oath,
at 12PM exactly. But you can also look at the government as a continuous
thing, the only difference is there is a new person occupying the office
of president. Same government, the one defined by the Constitution.
</li>
<li>
So on January 6, 2021, the then-president Donald Trump, tried to destroy
the government, replacing it with a new government, one that doesn’t
follow the Constitution. That’s the thing to focus on. He used a weapon,
akin to using a gun to try to murder someone, but the crime isn’t trying
to overturn an election, it’s the intended consequence of what he did
that matters.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
PS: You could say he was guilty of trying to destroy the government, but
our language has a special word for that, it’s overthrow. Thus Trump
tried to overthrow the government of the United States.
</p>
<p>
PPS: I used ChatGPT to
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/2fcd3869-181c-4a7b-b4cd-672835f51562">confirm</a>
that the presidency
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">transfers</a>
at exactly 12PM on Inauguration Day. There is no time that there is not
a president.

<ol type="1">
<li>America’s carbon emissions fell for the first time since the
pandemic
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>America’s greenhouse gas pollution from energy and
industrial activities fell by 1.9% in 2023 compared to the year before,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=aa4d840a0e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> energy research firm the Rhodium Group. This marks the first time
since the pandemic that carbon emissions have dropped. But perhaps more
importantly, the reduction happened even as the broader American economy
grew. “It’s the first time this decade that the United States has hit
the important mark of growing its economy and cutting its climate
pollution at the same time,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=47aa5f11ff&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says
<em>Heatmap</em>’s Robinson Meyer</a>. Climate pollution from the power
sector fell by 8% last year, a greater decline than in any other part of
the economy, driven partly by the death of the coal industry, partly by
an exceptionally warm winter. But there is still much work to be done:
America must roughly triple its pace of pollution reductions to meet its
Paris Agreement goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030. “Emissions
cuts of that magnitude are probably not feasible,” Meyer

traditional mineral mining, but environmentalists worry it could destroy
delicate ecosystems. More than 20 countries recently backed a moratorium
on deep-sea mining.

<li>Study calculates climate impact of Gaza conflict

<strong></strong>The conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is
generating large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions, according to a

The research finds that, in the first 60 days of the war, the emissions
footprint of Israel’s military response – including pollution from
military vehicles, exploding bombs and rockets, and aircraft missions –
was “roughly the equivalent of 75 coal-fired power plants operating for
a year.” The study has yet to be peer reviewed. However it is the first
attempt to quantify the conflict’s climate impact, <em>The Guardian

Kickstarting “The Bezzle” audiobook, sequel to Red Team Blues (10 Jan
2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Kickstarting “The Bezzle” audiobook, sequel to Red Team
Blues: Another Wil Wheaton banger, necessitated by Amazon’s perfidy. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2014,
2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances,
current writing projects, current reading Kickstarting “The Bezzle”
audiobook, sequel to Red Team Blues (permalink) I’m kickstarting the
audiobook for The Bezzle, the sequel to last year’s Red Team Blues,
featuring Marty Hench, a hard-charging, two-fisted forensic accountant
who spent 40 years in Silicon Valley, busting every finance scam hatched
by tech bros’ feverish imaginations: http://thebezzle.org Marty Hench is
a great character to write. His career in high-tech scambusting starts
in the early 1980s with the first PCs and stretches all the way to the
cryptocurrency era, the most target-rich environment for scamhunting
tech has ever seen. Hench is the Zelig of tech scams, and I’m having so
much fun using him to probe the seamy underbelly of the tech economy.
Enter The Bezzle, which will be published by Tor Books and Head of Zeus
on Feb 20: this adventure finds Marty in the company of Scott Warms, one
of the many bright technologists whose great startup was bought and
destroyed by Yahoo! (yes, they really used that asinine exclamation
mark). Scott is shackled to the Punctuation Factory by golden handcuffs,
and he’s determined to get fired without cause, so he can collect his
shares and move onto the next thing. That’s how Scott and Marty find
themselves on Catalina island, the redoubt of the Wrigley family, where
bison roam the hills, yachts bob in the habor and fast food is banned.
Scott invites Marty on a series of luxury vacations on Catalina, which
end abruptly when they discover – and implode – a hamburger-related
Ponzi scheme run by a real-estate millionaire who is destroying the
personal finances of the Island’s working-class townies out of sheer
sadism. Scott’s victory is bittersweet: sure, he blew up the Ponzi
scheme, but he’s also made powerful enemies – the kinds of enemies who
can pull strings with the notoriously corrupt LA County Sheriff’s
Deputies who are the only law on Catalina, and after taking a pair of
felony plea deals, Scott gets the message and never visits Catalina
Island again. That could have been the end of it, but California’s
three-strikes law – since rescinded – means that when Scott picks up one
more felony conviction for some drugs discovered during a traffic stop,
he’s facing life in prison. That’s where The Bezzle really gets into
gear. At its core, The Bezzle is a novel about the “shitty technology
adoption curve”: the idea that our worst technological schemes are
sanded smooth on the bodies of prisoners, mental patients, kids and
refugees before they work their way up the privilege gradient and are
inflicted on all of us:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men
America’s prisons are vicious, brutal places, and technology has only
made them worse. When Scott’s prison swaps out in-person visits, the
prison library, and phone calls for a “free” tablet that offers all
these services as janky apps that cost ten times more than they would on
the outside, the cruelty finds a business model. Working inside and
outside the prison Marty Hench and Scott Warms figure out the full
nature of the scam that the captive audience of prisoners are
involuntary beta-testers for, and they discover a sprawling web of
real-estate fraud, tech scams, and offshore finance that is extracting
fortunes from the hides of America’s prisoners and their families. The
criminals who run that kind of enterprise aren’t shy about fighting for
what they’ve got, and they’re more than happy to cut some of LA County’s
notorious deputy gangs in for a cut in exchange for providing some
kinetic support for the project. The Bezzle is exactly the kind of book
I was hoping I’d get to write when I kicked off the Hench series – one
that decodes the scam economy, from music royalties to prison
videoconferencing, real estate investment trusts to Big Four accounting
firm bogus audits. It’s both a fast-moving, two-fisted crime novel and a
masterclass on how the rich and powerful get away with both literal and
figurative murder. It’s getting a big push from both my publishers and
I’ll be touring western Canada and the US with it. The early reviews are
spectacular. But despite all of this, I had to make my own audiobook for
it, which I’m pre-selling on Kickstarter: http://thebezzle.org Why?
Because Audible – Amazon’s monopoly gatekeeper to the audiobook world,
with more than 90% of the market – refuses to carry my work. Audible
uses Digital Rights Management to lock every audiobook they sell to
their platform. Legally, only an Audible-authorized app can decrypt and
play the audiobooks they sell you. Distributing a tool that removes
Audible DRM is a felony under Section 1201 of the 1998 DMCA. That means
that if you break up with Audible – delete your Audible apps – you will
lose your entire audiobook library. And the fact that you’re Audible’s
hostage makes the writers you love into their hostages, too. Writers
understand that if they leave the Audible platform, their audience will
have to choose between following them, or losing all their audiobooks.
That’s how Audible gets away with abusing its performers and writers, up
to and including the $100m Audiblegate wage-theft scandal:
https://www.audiblegate.com/ Audible can steal $100m from its
writers…and the writers still continue to sell on the platform, because
leaving will cost them their audience. This is canonical
enshittification: lock in users, then screw suppliers. Lots of companies
abuse DRM to do this, but none can hold a candle to Amazon, who
understand that the DMCA is a copyright law that protects corporations
at the expense of creators. Under DMCA 1201 commercial distribution of a
“circumvention device” carries a five-year prison sentence and a
$500,000 fine. That means that if I write a book, pay to have it
recorded, and then sell it to you through Audible, I am criminally
prohibited from giving you the tool to take it from Audible to another
platform. Even though I hold the copyright to that work, I would face a
harsher sentence than you would if you simply pirated the audiobook from
some darknet site. Not only that: if you shoplifted the audiobook in CD
form, you’d get a lighter sentence than I, the copyright holder, would
receive for giving you a tool to unlock it from Amazon’s platform! Hell,
if you hijacked the truck that delivered the CD, you’d get off lighter
than I would. This is a scam straight out of a Marty Hench novel. This
is batshit. I won’t allow it. My books are licensed on the condition
that they must not be sold with DRM. Which means that Audible won’t sell
my books, which means that my publishers are thoroughly disinterested in
paying thousands of dollars to produce audiobooks of my titles. A book
that isn’t sold in the one store than accounts for 90% of all sales is
unlikely to do well. That’s where you come in. Since 2020, I’ve used
Kickstarter to pre-sell five of my audiobooks (I wrote nine books during
lockdown!). All told, I’ve raised over $750,000 (gross! but still!) on
these crowdfunders. More than 20,000 backers have pitched in! The last
two of these books – The Internet Con and The Lost Cause – were national
bestsellers. This isn’t just a way for me to pay off a lot of bills and
put away something for retirement – it’s proof that readers care about
supporting writers and don’t want to be locked in by a giant monopolist
that depends on its drivers pissing in bottles to make quota. It’s a
powerful message about the desire for something better than Amazon. It’s
part of the current that is driving the FTC to haul Amazon into court
for being a monopolist, and also part of the inspiration for other
authors to try treating Amazon as damage and routing around it, with
spectacular results:
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragonsteel/surprise-four-secret-novels-by-brandon-sanderson
And I’m doing it again. Last December, I went into Skyboat Media’s
studios where Gabrielle De Cuir directed Wil Wheaton, who reprised his
role as Marty Hench for the audiobook of The Bezzle. It came out
amazing: https://archive.org/details/bezzle-sample Now I’m pre-selling
this audiobook, as well as the ebook and hardcover for The Bezzle. I’m
also offering bundles with the ebook and audiobook for Red Team Blues
(naturally these are all DRM-free). You can get your books signed and
personalized and shipped anywhere in the world, courtesy of Book Soup,
and I’ve partnered with Libro.fm to deliver DRM-free audiobooks with an
app for people who don’t want to mess around with sideloading. I’ve also
got some spendy options for high rollers. There’s three chances to name
a character in the next Hench novel (Picks and Shovels, Feb 2025).
There’s also five chances to commission a Hench short story about your
favorite tech scam, and get credited when the story is published. The
Kickstarter runs for the next three weeks, which should give me time to
get the hardcopy books signed and shipped to arrive around the on-sale
date. What’s more, I’ve finally worked out all the post-Brexit kinks
with shipping my UK publisher’s books to EU backers. I’m working with
Otherland Books to fulfill those EU orders, and it looks like I’m going
to be able to sign a giant stack of those when I’m in Berlin later this
month to give the annual Marshall McLuhan lecture at the Canadian
embassy: https://transmediale.de/en/2024/event/mcluhan-2024 Red Team
Blues and its sequels are some of the most fun – and informative – work
I’ve done in my quarter-century career. I love how they blend technical
explanations of the scam economy with high-intensity technothrillers.
That’s the the same mix as my bestselling YA series Little Brother
series – but these are firmly adult novels. The Bezzle came out great. I
hope you’ll give it a try – and that you’ll come out to see me in late
February when I hit the road with the book! Here’s that Kickstarter link

<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
There are a lot of pressing risks around the globe this year. What poses
the biggest risk? According to an annual report from political risk
consultancy Eurasia Group, the U.S. presidential election — expected to
exacerbate political dysfunction — tops the list. (But don’t worry, we
hear an upbeat prediction too.) Plus, are you an independent contractor
or an employee? Regulators have a new litmus test.

De Facto Ambassador to US Meets US House Speaker, China Angered</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI/BEIJING — Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the United States
met on Tuesday with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson,
Taiwan’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday, drawing a stern rebuke from
Beijing.</p>
<p>The United States is Taiwan’s most important international backer and
arms supplier despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties with the
island, which China views as its own territory.</p>
<p>Alexander Yui took up his new post last month, replacing Hsiao
Bi-khim, who is now running to be vice president in Taiwan’s elections
on Saturday.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s foreign ministry said Yui thanked the U.S. Congress for its
long-term, cross-party support for Taiwan and commitment to
strengthening the island’s defenses.</p>
<p>It said this was the first time the two men had met.</p>
<p>China staged war games around Taiwan in August of 2022 after
then-House speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei, and in Beijing the
Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed anger at the Johnson-Yui meeting.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers should “stop sending wrong signals to Taiwan
independence separatist forces and must not intervene in the Taiwan
region’s elections in any form,” spokesperson Mao Ning told
reporters.</p>
<p>China routinely objects to any form of what it views as official
contacts between Taiwanese and U.S. officials, saying it is an
interference in internal Chinese affairs. Beijing says Taiwan is the
most sensitive and important issue in Sino-U.S. relations.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s government opposes China’s sovereignty claims, saying the
People’s Republic of China has never ruled the island and has no right
to speak for it or control it as only Taiwan’s people can do that.</p>

<h2 id="the-mimo-diaries">The Mimo Diaries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/i-m-taking-over-minimalissimo-for-real-this-time">In
a post a couple of weeks ago</a>, I mentioned that I was going to take
over Minimalissimo—aka Mimo—starting January 1st and that I was planning
to blog about the whole experience.
</p>
<p>
Well, it’s January 10th, I am in charge of the site and I do plan to
post updates on this journey under the title <em>“The Mimo Diaries”</em>
and this is the first entry of the series.
</p>
<p>
So how is it going? I’d say so far so good. If you are a visitor of the
site you might have noticed that a first change is already in place:
posts no longer have short text content. Let me explain the reasoning
behind that decision.
</p>
<h2>
Writing on the web
</h2>
<p>
Minimalissimo started back in 2009 and the web was a very different
place. Content generation and content consumption were substantially
different than they are now and it made sense to have a “traditional”
blog/magazine with text and images.
</p>
<p>
But I believe that is no longer true in 2024. I’m not saying writing on
the web is pointless, quite the contrary. What I’m saying is that I
don’t think there’s much added value to the user in writing short posts
to go along with the images on the site. It’s probably useful from a SEO
perspective but, as you know, I don’t care about SEO all that much. I
care about users and user experience. And I think the value that Mimo
provides is in the visual curation, not in the written content.
</p>
<p>
Now, that is true for short posts but it’s definitely not true for the
newsletter. I do plan to keep that one going and make it a more
important part of the Mimo ecosystem. The newsletter is going to be the
place for longer content, focused on the topic of minimalism. That’s my
current plan and we’ll see how it goes. So,
<a href="https://buttondown.email/minimalissimo" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">make
sure you subscribe to the Minimalissimo newsletter</a> if you want to
get the full Minimalissimo experience.

Carbon Emissions Fell for the First Time Since Covid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAzNzgwMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzQzNjg4M30.ogEGH17r01Kn2hiq5hTQ7TQrW_xmd2W_vTQEhrkSM5w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
For the first time since the pandemic began, both America’s economy and
its carbon emissions moved in the right direction last year, according
to
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
major annual estimate</a> of the country’s climate pollution.
</p>
<p>
America’s greenhouse gas pollution from energy and industrial activities
fell by 1.9% in 2023 compared to the year before, even as the broader
American economy grew, according to the Rhodium Group, an energy
research firm. It’s the first time this decade that the United States
has hit the important mark of growing its economy and cutting its
climate pollution at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Yet despite that progress, emissions probably aren’t falling fast enough
for the U.S. to hit its climate goals under the Paris Agreement.
</p>
<p>
The new report is the first to provide a sense of how America’s
greenhouse gas emissions changed last year, when the fuel economy of new
cars
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fuel-economy-record-epa-evs-hybrids" target="_self">hit
an all-time high</a> and the Biden administration’s climate law
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/john-podesta-tax-credits-schedule-hydrogen-sustainable-aviation-fuel-manufacturing" target="_self">began
to go into effect</a>. The estimate is part of the Rhodium Group’s
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long-running</a>
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">series</a>
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2021/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">of</a>
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/taking-stock-2020/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analyses</a>
of American emissions, which are regularly cited by experts and
government officials.
</p>
<p>
Here are five big takeaways from the new report:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. The American economy is becoming less carbon-intensive — and
the rate of that change is accelerating.</strong>
</p>
<p>
America’s carbon emissions peaked in 2005, when the U.S. released
<a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/u-s-emissions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nearly
7.5 billion tons</a> of greenhouse gases. Since then, the economy has
kept growing, but climate pollution has slowly fallen. Last year,
America emitted as much carbon as it did in 1991, when the economy was
roughly a quarter of its current size.
</p>
<p>
This trend has picked up recently, according to the new report. Although
the American economy
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/07/economy/us-economy-china-europe/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
mounted a vigorous recovery</a> from the pandemic recession, emissions
remain about 6% below their 2019 level. The U.S. also cut emissions
faster this year than it did during the 2010s.

Group</small>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. The power grid is driving most of those emissions
reductions.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Last year, climate pollution from the power sector fell by 8%, a greater
decline than in any other part of the economy.
</p>
<p>
That’s partly because the coal industry is dying. Coal continues to
generate less and less power every year (even though it
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/07/us-carbon-emissions-russian-invasion/661493/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blipped
back up briefly</a> in 2021) as the economics of natural gas, wind, and
solar drive it off the grid. Not only did the United States
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/solar/chart-the-us-installed-more-solar-in-2023-than-ever-before#:~:text=This%20has%20been%20a%20record,Industries%20Association%20and%20Wood%20Mackenzie." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">installed
a record amount</a> of solar in 2023, it also opened its
<a href="https://www.georgiapower.com/company/news-center/2023-articles/vogtle-unit-3-goes-into-operation.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first
new nuclear reactor in decades</a>. Last year, for only the second time
ever, nuclear power plants generated more electricity than coal plants
did.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. A warm winter also helped.</strong>
</p>
<p>
About 10% of America’s greenhouse gas emissions are produced by
buildings, which mostly mean the furnaces in homes and offices. Space
heating is
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press535.php#:~:text=Households%20that%20used%20fuel%20oil,their%20primary%20space%2Dheating%20fuel." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
most energy-intensive thing</a> most Americans do in their homes, and
the overwhelming majority of American
<a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/6/20/17474124/electrification-natural-gas-furnace-heat-pump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">private
residences</a> and
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60301#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20is%20the%20predominant,for%20space%20heating%20in%202018." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commercial
buildings</a> are heated with fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to climate change, 2023 was
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67861954" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
warmest year ever measured</a>, featuring
<a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/verification-2022-2023-us-winter-outlook#:~:text=The%20winter%20temperature%20outlook%20for,Michigan%20to%20the%20West%20Coast." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an
especially mild winter</a> in the eastern and southern parts of the
country. That meant that — ironically — Americans had to burn less oil,
propane, and gas in their tens of millions of furnaces nationwide to
keep warm, causing building emissions to fall by about 4% compared to
the year before.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4. Transportation and industrial emissions are still
problems</strong>.
</p>
<h3>
U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Major Emitting Sector
</h3>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="Chart of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="1df8f8564f8f99bcbf17fd2dbc0b46e1" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="4ebb5" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAzODY0Ny9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDMzNDc2Nn0.ZgEEaffJyoRc9t81uco7UXrn9lspM9V326aaUYPoLFY/image.png?width=980"/>
<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">In
million metric tons of CO2
equivalent.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Rhodium
Group</small>
</p>
<p>
Not every part of the economy saw emissions fall. In the transportation
sector, carbon pollution levels rose slightly, driven not by cars and
trucks as much as by an increase in air travel, which all but depends on
fossil fuels. Last year was
<a href="https://www.airport-technology.com/news/us-busiest-year-ever-air-travel/#:~:text=The%20US%20aviation%20industry%20celebrated,Department%20of%20Transportation%20(DOT)." target="_blank">the
busiest year for air travel</a> in American history, and demand for jet
fuel rose 5% compared to 2022.
</p>
<p>
The industrial sector — a catch-all term for dozens of heavy industries,
including steel, cement, mining, and chemicals-making — also increased
its emissions last year. Unlike in the power sector (and, for that
matter, ground-based transportation), engineers and experts
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/cop28-global-stocktake-climate-tech" target="_self">are
still figuring out</a> how to do many of the most carbon-intensive
industrial activities without releasing greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
But the industrial sector also includes the fossil-fuel industry, and
last year, America’s oil and gas production
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-oil-output-hits-record-producers-boost-drilling-efficiency-kemp-2023-11-01/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reached
an all-time high</a>. Oil and natural gas emit climate pollution not
just when they’re burned, but also when they’re extracted, and in 2023,
the country’s roaring oil and gas industry was the biggest contributor
to the industrial sector’s rising emissions.
</p>
<p>
Leaking, flaring, or venting natural gas — which is mostly comprised of
methane, a greenhouse gas more than 20 times as potent as carbon dioxide
over the long term — especially puts additional climate pollution in the
air. While the EPA will soon begin enforcing rules that crack down on
natural gas-related pollution, those aren’t in place yet.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. The U.S. remains off its Paris Agreement track.</strong>
</p>
<p>
President Biden has pledged that the United States will cut its
emissions in half as compared to their all-time high by 2030. But with
six years left to meet that deadline, emissions are only 17.2% below
their high.
</p>
<p>
That means America must roughly triple its pace of pollution reductions
— cutting them by 6.9% each year — to meet its goal.
</p>
<p>
Although carbon pollution is likely to drop more quickly in the next few
years, especially as the Inflation Reduction Act and new Environmental
Protection Agency rules kick in, emissions cuts of that magnitude are
probably not feasible. That said, almost
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/11/08/climate/cop27-emissions-country-compare.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">no
other country</a> is on track to meet its Paris Agreement goals, either.
So at least there’s that.

Discusses Palestinian Authority Reforms in Abbas Talks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed
administrative reforms with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas during a
meeting Wednesday in the West Bank, along with efforts to boost
humanitarian aid to people in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement that
Blinken “reaffirmed that the United States supports tangible steps
towards the creation of a Palestinian state alongside the State of
Israel, with both living in peace and security.”</p>
<p>Blinken also called for Israel to transfer all Palestinian tax
revenue it collects to the Palestinian authority in accordance with
existing agreements.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority governs part of the West Bank, while the
Hamas militant group has controlled the Gaza Strip where Israel is
fighting to eradicate the group.</p>
<p>The United States has envisioned a postwar roadmap that puts Gaza
under a Palestinian-led governance with no role for Hamas.</p>
<p>But some analysts are skeptical and play down the prospect.</p>
<p>“I don’t see how the Palestinian Authority will go back into Gaza and
assume any kind of meaningful control over what is left of Gaza. They’re
having a very hard time maintaining control, even in the West Bank,”
Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told VOA
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Blinken has stressed the potential for Israel to win acceptance from
Arab neighbors by seeking a path toward establishing a Palestinian state
as a means to resolve the longstanding conflict.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has firmly rejected the two-state solution.</p>
<p>Blinken said Tuesday that displaced Palestinians must be able to
return home as soon as conditions allow, and Israel has agreed to allow
a United Nations mission to evaluate the situation in war-ravaged
northern Gaza.</p>
<p>“As Israel’s campaign moves to a lower intensity phase in northern
Gaza and as the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] scales down its forces
there, we agreed today on a plan for the U.N. to carry out an assessment
mission. It will determine what needs to be done to allow displaced
Palestinians to return safely to homes in the north,” Blinken told
reporters during a Tuesday news conference in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>The top diplomat also urged Israeli leaders to prevent further harm
to Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p>“The daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is
far too high,” he said.</p>
<p>International Court of Justice hearings</p>
<p>Later this week, the International Court of Justice will conduct
hearings on a case filed by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide
against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and seeking an emergency
suspension of its military campaign.</p>
<p>The United States believes the case is meritless and that it
distracts from Israel’s efforts to fight threats from Hamas militants
and other Iran proxies, including Hezbollah and the Houthis, according
to Blinken.</p>
<p>“We want this war to end as soon as possible,” he said. “But it’s
vital that Israel achieves its very legitimate objectives of ensuring
that October 7 can never happened again.”</p>
<p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog has rejected the genocide charge filed
at the International Court of Justice, calling the accusation “atrocious
and preposterous.”</p>
<p>Hostages held in Gaza</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Blinken held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, President Herzog, Foreign Minister Israel Katz, and other
senior officials from Israel’s war Cabinet in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>“The Secretary and Prime Minister discussed ongoing efforts to secure
the release of all remaining hostages and the importance of increasing
the level of humanitarian assistance reaching civilians in Gaza,”
according to a statement from the State Department.</p>
<p>“In this regard, the Secretary welcomed the appointment of Sigrid
Kaag as the UN’s Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator for
Gaza, pledging close cooperation with her in this new capacity,” the
statement added.</p>
<p>Blinken also met on Tuesday with the families of some of the hostages
held by Hamas militants in Gaza. And he relayed to Israeli leaders some
of what he heard from other leaders in the region during stops in
Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi
Arabia.</p>
<p>Gaza health officials say more than 23,000 Palestinians, a large
percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel’s
military offensive in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Escalation in no one’s interest</p>
<p>After an Israeli airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander in
southern Lebanon on Monday — the latest sign of a possibly widening
conflict in the Middle East — Blinken told reporters it is clearly not
in the interest of Israel, Lebanon or Hezbollah to see an escalation
outside Gaza.</p>
<p>Hezbollah has identified the commander as Wissam al-Tawil. Last week,
senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike in
Beirut. Hamas and Hezbollah are both U.S. designated terrorist
organizations, and both are backed by Iran, whose militant allies in
Syria, Iraq and Yemen have been carrying out longer-range attacks
against Israel.</p>
<p>The United States has urged Israel to shift to smaller-scale military
operations in Gaza but has continued to support Israel in refusing Arab
demands for a cease-fire in the three-month war. Israel has vowed to
continue the war until it believes the threat of future Hamas attacks
has been eradicated and the militant group no longer controls Gaza, a
narrow strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas
fighters crossed into southern Israel on October 7. Israel said about
1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror
attack.</p>

Reuters, Agence France-Presse and The Associated Press.</p>

<h2 id="us-china-conclude-military-talks-in-washington">US, China
Conclude Military Talks in Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States and China wrapped up two days of
military talks in Washington Tuesday, the Pentagon said, the latest
engagement since the two countries agreed to resume military-to-military
ties.</p>
<p>Washington and Beijing are at loggerheads over everything from the
future of democratically ruled Taiwan to territorial claims in the South
China Sea. Ties are still recovering after the U.S. downed an alleged
Chinese spy balloon in February.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed late
last year to resume military ties, severed by Beijing after a visit in
August 2022 by then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to
Taiwan.</p>
<p>The 17th round of the talks saw Michael Chase, the deputy assistant
secretary of defense for China, Taiwan, and Mongolia, meet China’s Major
General Song Yanchao, deputy director of the central military commission
office for international military co-operation, the Pentagon said.</p>
<p>“The two sides discussed U.S.-PRC defense relations, and Chase
highlighted the importance of maintaining open lines of
military-to-military communication in order to prevent competition from
veering into conflict,” the statement added, using an acronym for the
People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials say communication between the two militaries is
key to preventing a miscalculation from spiraling into conflict.</p>
<p>The top U.S. military officer, General Charles Q. Brown, the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff held a virtual meeting last month with his
Chinese counterpart, General Liu Zhenli.</p>
<p>China is willing to develop healthy and stable military-to-military
relations with the U.S. “on the basis of equality and respect,” its
defense ministry said in a statement Wednesday, citing the meeting.</p>
<p>It urged the U.S. to cut military deployment and “provocative
actions” in the South China Sea, as well halt support for such actions
by “certain countries,” but did not identify them.</p>
<p>It asked the U.S. to abide by the one-China principle and stop arming
Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, despite Taiwan’s strong
objections, and vowed never to compromise on the issue.</p>
<p>“The United States should fully understand the root causes of the
maritime and air security issues, strictly restrain its front-line
forces, and stop hyping up (the issues),” it added.</p>
<p>Taiwan is holding presidential and parliamentary polls this weekend
amid a ramped-up war of words between Taiwan and China.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>U.S. officials have cautioned that even with some restoration of
military communications, forging truly functional dialog between the two
sides could take time.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>On the docket today in front of three judges on the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit was the question of whether former
presidents can be prosecuted for things they did while in office. The
issue at hand is whether Trump can be tried for his attempt to overturn
the 2020 presidential election, but Trump has also been charged in three
other criminal cases: a national case over his mishandling of national
security documents, a state case in Georgia for interfering with the
2020 election there, and a state case in New York for paying hush money
to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. He is also facing a number of
civil cases.</p>

id="sec-chair-denies-bitcoin-etf-approved-says-x-account-was-hacked">SEC
Chair Denies Bitcoin ETF Approved, Says X Account Was Hacked</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that a
post sent from the agency’s account on the social platform X announcing
the approval of a long-awaited bitcoin exchange-traded fund was
“unauthorized,” and that the agency’s account was hacked. </p>
<p>The price of bitcoin briefly spiked more than $1,000 after the post
on X, formerly known as Twitter, claimed “The SEC grants approval for
#Bitcoin ETFs for listing on all registered national securities
exchanges.” Cryptocurrency investors had already driven bitcoin’s price
above $46,000 in anticipation of the approval. </p>
<p>An ETF would provide a way to invest in bitcoin without having to buy
the cryptocurrency outright on a crypto exchange such as Binance or
Coinbase. </p>
<p>But soon after the initial post appeared, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler
said on his personal account that the SEC’s account was compromised and,
“The SEC has not approved the listing and trading of spot bitcoin
exchange-traded products.” Gensler called the post unauthorized without
providing further explanation. </p>
<p>“Welp,” wrote Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, on X. Like many
bitcoin investors, Klippsten had been expecting the agency to approve
bitcoin ETFs potentially as soon as this week. </p>
<p>The price of bitcoin swung from about $46,730 to just below $48,000
after the unauthorized post hit, then dropped to around $45,200 after
the SEC’s denial. It was trading around $46,150 at 6:15 p.m. ET. </p>
<p>It was unclear how the SEC’s social media account was hacked. Shortly
after Gensler’s statement, it appeared that the SEC had gotten control
over the account. </p>
<p>Politicians, particularly Republicans who have long expressed

the SEC’s lax security controls over its accounts. </p>
<p>“Just like the SEC would demand accountability from a public company

what just happened,” said Senator Bill Hagerty, who sits on the Senate
Banking Committee. </p>
<p>This is not the first time there has been false market-moving

approval for bitcoin ETF, causing bitcoin prices to jump sharply. </p>
<p>Elon Musk gutted Twitter’s content moderation and security teams
after taking over the platform in late 2022. And while internet watchdog
groups have complained about a spike in toxic content, including
antisemitic and other hate speech on X, many also worry about account
integrity. </p>
<p>“The consequences of account takeovers could potentially be
significant, and especially during an election year,” said Brett Callow,

<h2 id="hobbes-os2-archive-to-shut-down-in-three-months">Hobbes OS/2
Archive to shut down in three months</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve got some seriously bad news for the OS/2 community. Hobbes, the
massive software archive for OS/2 (and thus eComStation and ArcaOS),
which hosts both old software as well as more recent releases, is
shutting down in three months. After many years of service,
hobbes.nmsu.edu will be decommissioned and will no longer be available.
You the user are responsible for downloading any of the files found in
this archive if you want them. These files will no longer be available
for access or download as of the decommission date. As of April 15th,
2024 this site will no longer exist. No one will be able to access this
site or any information/files stored on this site as of April 15th,
2024. I don’t even know how old Hobbes is, but I feel like it’s been
around for decades. Seeing it being shut down is incredibly sad to read,
but also a sign of the times for whatever’s left of the OS/2 community.
Two of the four listed mirrors seem to be up, namely SunSITE Poland and
Infania Networks in Sweden. We’ll see how long those last, but my advice
to anyone interested in OS/2 – download the Hobbes archive and store it
locally.</p>

<p>It’s CES, and Google has made a number of disparate, small
announcements about upcoming Android features. 9To5Google has collected
them all, and it seems there’s not many things of interest here, nor are
there any big changes or improvements. The only thing that stands out to
me is that easy Bluetooth device pairing is coming to more scenarios.
First announced at CES 2022, Fast Pair support is rolling out to the
Chromecast with Google TV “in the next month.” This seamless Bluetooth
pairing with an onscreen “Connect now” prompt for headphones is coming
to “more Google TV devices later this year.” ↫ Abner Li for 9To5Google
Bluetooth pairing is an unpleasant experience, so seeing fast pairing
become more popular is good news.</p>

clues from nature: the impact of grass hay on suckling piglets’
gastrointestinal growth and colonic microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The effect of dietary fiber on pig production has been extensively
evaluated. Inspired by observations of the diet of wild, young piglets,
this study aimed to examine the possibility of feeding grass hay to
suckling piglets besides concentrated creep feed.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
The sow-nursed piglets in this study were divided into two groups based
on balanced sow parities. The control group (CON, <italic>n</italic> = 7
sows) only received a regular, concentrated creep feed, while the
treatment piglets (GH, <italic>n</italic> = 8 sows) were also provided
with chopped grass hay from 2 days of age until weaning (28 days). At
weaning, one piglet with a median weight was selected from each litter
for post-mortem evaluation. Subsequently, six pigs around median weight
per sow were grouped into nursery pens and monitored for their feed
intake and body weight gain until 9 weeks of age.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results and discussion
</title>
<p>
Piglets in GH consumed, on average, 57 g of grass hay per piglet during
the entire lactation period. The emptied weight of the small and large
intestine was significantly greater in GH (280 vs. 228 g, 88.8 vs. 79.3
g, respectively, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and the length of the
large intestine was stimulated by the grass hay (164 vs. 150 cm,
<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Morphologically, the villus height in the
jejunum was higher in GH (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the large
intestine, the crypt depth of the mid-colon was lower in GH. Moreover,
the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations in the cecum were
increased in GH compared to CON (1,179 vs. 948 µmol/g dry matter,
<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas in the colon, SCFA concentrations
were lower in CON (341 vs. 278 µmol/g dry matter, <italic>p</italic>
&lt; 0.05). There was no major impact of grass hay inclusion on the
colonic microbiota composition. Only a trend was observed for a lower
inverse of the classical Simpson (InvSimpon) index and a higher
abundance of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> genera in GH. After weaning,
no significant differences in feed intake and body weight gain were
observed. In conclusion, supplementing the grass hay to suckling piglets
led to alterations in intestinal morphology, increased SCFA fermentation
in proximal sections of large intestine, stimulation of gastrointestinal
tract growth, and subtle modifications in colonic microbiota.

vitro inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm formation by
DZ2002 through regulation of extracellular DNA and alginate
production</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>P. aeruginosa)</italic>
is a common pathogen associated with biofilm infections, which can lead
to persistent infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop
new anti-biofilm drugs. DZ2002 is a reversible inhibitor that targets
S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and possesses anti-inflammatory and
immune-regulatory activities. However, its anti-biofilm activity has not
been reported yet.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods and results
</title>
<p>
Therefore, we investigated the effect of DZ2002 on <italic>P.
aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 biofilm formation by crystal violet staining
(CV), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and
confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The results indicated that
although DZ2002 didn’t affect the growth of planktonic PAO1, it could
significantly inhibit the formation of mature biofilms. During the
inhibition of biofilm formation by DZ2002, there was a parallel decrease
in the synthesis of alginate and the expression level of alginate genes,
along with a weakening of swarming motility. However, these results were
unrelated to the expression of <italic>lasI, lasR, rhII, rhIR</italic>.
Additionally, we also found that after treatment with DZ2002, the
biofilms and extracellular DNA content of PAO1 were significantly
reduced. Molecular docking results further confirmed that DZ2002 had a
strong binding affinity with the active site of S-adenosylhomocysteine
hydrolase (SahH) of PAO1.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
In summary, our results indicated that DZ2002 may interact with SahH in
PAO1, inhibiting the formation of mature biofilms by downregulating
alginate synthesis, extracellular DNA production and swarming motility.
These findings demonstrate the potential value of DZ2002 in treating
biofilm infections associated with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.

of OxyR regulator on oxidative stress, Apx toxin secretion and virulence
of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae</italic>, the causative agent of
porcine pleuropneumonia, poses a significant threat to global swine
populations due to its high prevalence, mortality rates, and substantial
economic ramifications. Understanding the pathogen’s defense mechanisms
against host-produced reactive oxygen species is crucial for its
survival, with OxyR, a conserved bacterial transcription factor, being
pivotal in oxidative stress response.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study investigated the presence and role of OxyR in <italic>A.
pleuropneumoniae</italic> serovar 1-12 reference strains. Transcriptomic
analysis was conducted on an oxyR disruption mutant to delineate the
biological activities influenced by OxyR. Additionally, specific assays
were employed to assess urease activity, catalase expression, ApxI toxin
secretion, as well as adhesion and invasion abilities of the oxyR
disruption mutant on porcine 3D4/21 and PT cells. A mice challenge
experiment was also conducted to evaluate the impact of oxyR
inactivation on <italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic> virulence.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
OxyR was identified as a conserved regulator present in <italic>A.
pleuropneumoniae</italic> serovar 1-12 reference strains. Transcriptomic
analysis revealed the involvement of OxyR in multiple biological
activities. The oxyR disruption resulted in decreased urease activity,
elevated catalase expression, enhanced ApxI toxin secretion—attributed
to OxyR binding to the apxIBD promoter—and reduced adhesion and invasion
abilities on porcine cells. Furthermore, inactivation of oxyR reduced
the virulence of <italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic> in a mice
challenge experiment.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
The findings highlight the pivotal role of OxyR in influencing the
virulence mechanisms of <italic>A. pleuropneumoniae</italic>. The
observed effects on various biological activities underscore OxyR as an
essential factor contributing to the pathogenicity of this bacterium.

and resistance characteristics of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus
pneumoniae isolated from the respiratory tracts of hospitalized children
in Shenzhen, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
PCV13 introduction in China has led to a significant reduction of
vaccine serotype <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. However,
non-vaccine serotypes with highly resistance and invasiveness were often
reported in the post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine era and there was
regional differences.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A total of 669 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> strains were collected
from the respiratory tracts of hospitalized children at Shenzhen
Children’s Hospital in 2021 and 2022. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)
characteristics were assessed through antibiotic susceptibility testing
performed with the VITEK 2 compact system. AMR genes and single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pbp1a, pbp2b, and pbp2x were
identified via analysis of whole genome sequencing data. Statistical
examination of the data was conducted employing chi-square and Fisher’s
exact tests.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
We found that non-vaccine serotypes strains had accounted for 46.6% of
all the pneumococcal isolated strains. The most common non-vaccine
serotype is 23A, with a prevalence rate of 8.9%, followed by 15A (6.6%),
6E (5.7%), 34 (3.2%), and 15B (2.9%). The multidrug resistance rates
(MDR) of vaccine serotypes were 19F (99.36%), 19A (100%), 23F (98.08%),
6B (100%), and 6C (100%). Meanwhile, the MDR of non-vaccine serotypes
were 15B (100.00%), 6E (100%), 15C (100%), 34 (95.24%), and 23A
(98.31%). Resistance rates of 6E to more than six antibiotic classes
reached 89.47%, which is similar to 19F (83.33%) and 19A (90%). Unique
resistance profiles were also identified for non-vaccine serotypes,
including significantly higher resistance to chloramphenicol in 6E, 15B,
and 15C than in 19F and 19A. Furthermore, through genome sequencing, we
revealed strong correlation of <italic>cat-TC</italic> with
chloramphenicol resistance, <italic>patA/patB</italic> with tetracycline
resistance, <italic>ermB</italic> and <italic>pmrA</italic> with
erythromycin resistance.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The introduction of PCV13 into China from 2017 has led to a shift in the
dominant composition of pneumococcal strains. There has been a notable
rise and spread of multidrug-resistant non-vaccine serotypes among
children. Specifically, the non-vaccine serotype 6E, which was not
widely reported in China previously, has emerged. To comprehend the
resistance mechanisms, it is crucial to further investigate the
molecular and genetic characteristics of these non-vaccine serotypes.

<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
In the context of increasing reports of co-infection with coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), particularly with human herpes viruses (HHVs),
it is important to consider the appropriate treatment options for HHVs
that have been reactivated by COVID-19.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Case presentation
</title>
<p>
This study presents two cases of severe COVID-19 with HHV co-infection.
The first case involved a critically ill patient with COVID-19
co-infected with herpes simplex virus type 1, confirmed using
metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and another patient with severe
COVID-19 experiencing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation, as
evidenced by elevated EBV-DNA levels in the serum. Treatment included
high-dose glucocorticoids and sivelestat sodium, with notable
improvements observed after initiating ganciclovir anti-herpesvirus
therapy.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
This study underscores the significance of recognizing HHV co-infections
in severe COVID-19 cases and highlights the potential of combining
anti-HHV treatment, increased glucocorticoid dosages, and anti-cytokine
storm therapy to enhance prognosis.

maltophilia complex: insights into evolutionary relationships, global
distribution and pathogenicity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-10, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> complex (Smc) comprises
opportunistic Gram-negative bacilli responsible for various nosocomial
infections. Limited data exists concerning its evolutionary lineage,
global prevalence and pathogenicity.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We conducted an extensive genomic analysis on 734 Smc genomes, of which
90 were newly sequenced and isolated from different patients. The
species composition and evolutionary relationships of Smc were examined
using core protein sequence analysis. Pathogenicity evaluation was used
by assays for swimming motility, biofilm formation and identification of
virulence factors. The broth microdilution method was used to evaluate
the drug resistance spectrum of clinical isolates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Phylogenetic analyses delineated 24 species-level clades, dominated by
<italic>S. maltophilia</italic> (42.8%), <italic>S. sepilia</italic>
(13.6%) and <italic>S. geniculata</italic> (9.9%). Geographically,
strains were primarily distributed in Europe (34.2%), Asia (33.7%) and
North America (24.0%), with intricate global distribution patterns.
Meanwhile, 154 virulence-associated genes and 46 antimicrobial
resistance genes within Smc were identified. These genes encoded span
various functions, including motility, adherence, toxin, RND antibiotic
efflux pumps, beta-lactamases and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes.
Moreover, significant variations were indicated in swimming motility and
biofilm-forming capability across the different species, with <italic>S.
sepilia</italic> exhibiting superior levels of both traits.
Additionally, no statistically significant discrepancy was detected
among Smc species to other antibiotics, despite the fact that all
<italic>S. geniculata</italic> isolates were resistant to Ceftazidime
and much higher than other species.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our findings indicate the need to pay increased attention to other
mainstream species of Smc besides <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> in
order to better manage Smc-related infections and tailor effective
treatment strategies.

Lawmakers Back in Session, Working on Border Security, Ukraine Aid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers came back into session this week after a
three-week holiday break to continue work toward a deal on border
security in return for Republican votes to send more aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We are closer to an agreement than we have been since the beginning
of these talks,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, one of the lead
negotiators on the deal, told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I wish that we weren’t in this position. I wish that Senate
Republicans supported Ukraine aid because they believe in Ukraine,” he
said. “I wish that we weren’t conditioning support for Ukraine upon the
resolution of the most difficult issue in American politics —
immigration reform.”</p>
<p>The White House’s $106 billion national security supplemental request
also includes funding for border security as well as nearly $14 billion
in aid to Israel and funding for Taiwan to combat the threat posed by
China.</p>
<p>Senate negotiators continued meeting remotely throughout the three
weeks Congress was out of session.</p>
<p>“We are working very hard to come up with an agreement to improve our
situation at the border. But it’s also important to remember the world
is literally at war,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told
reporters Tuesday. “This is the most serious international situation we
have faced since the Berlin Wall came down. We need to pass the
supplemental, and there needs to be a strong border provision part of
it.”</p>
<p>The United States has dedicated more than $100 billion to arming and
supporting Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in
February 2022, and President Joe Biden has asked Congress to approve an
additional $60 billion. Republicans in Congress have become increasingly
skeptical about the need to continue underwriting Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>The Pentagon announced on December 27 a new $250 million security
assistance package for Ukraine, which included additional munitions for
surface-to-air missiles systems, artillery rounds and more air defense
components. The Pentagon still has $4 billion available to provide
Ukraine with military aid, but no funds are available to replenish the
U.S. military’s stockpiles. Officials tell VOA that no new aid packages
are expected until Congress provides more funding.</p>
<p>Republicans in the Senate have conditioned approval of any additional
money for Ukraine on the simultaneous strengthening of immigration rules
aimed at reducing the number of people illegally entering the United
States at its southern border and expelling some who are already in the
country.</p>
<p>According to multiple news organizations, an estimated 300,000 people
crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in December 2023. That estimate marks the
highest recorded number of U.S.-Mexico border crossings.</p>
<p>Even if an agreement passes in the Senate, it might not survive in
the House, where Republicans hold a very narrow majority. A significant
group of Republican House members oppose additional aid to Ukraine, and
the party in early October voted out a speaker who partnered with
Democrats to pass legislation.</p>
<p>Last week, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson led a delegation of 60
House Republicans to visit the U.S.-Mexico border at Eagle Pass,
Texas.</p>
<p>“If President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill focused on
national security, it better begin with defending America’s national
security,” Johnson told reporters at a news conference on the
border.</p>
<p>Republicans have proposed their own legislation, H.R. 2, which would
resume construction of a border wall as well as impose new restrictions
on asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>VOA Pentagon Correspondent Carla Babb contributed reporting.</p>

<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAzNTM3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzU4NTI4N30.cC-2nVaicUHk15s1g22Hu1nroK_ufwHo60gldotwpwk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
We’re gonna need a bigger electricity generation system. That’s what PJM
Interconnection, the massive electricity market spanning 13 states on
the East Coast and in the
Midwest,<a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/load-forecast/2024-load-report.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
said in a report Monday</a>.
</p>
<p>
PJM predicted that its peak electricity demand would increase every year
by 1.7% in the summer and 2% in the winter. It also anticipates overall
energy use to grow 2.4% annually over the next decade — an increase of
200,000 gigawatt-hours, or roughly 25%, by 2034.
</p>
<p>
That increase in demand is also about three times a previous
forecast,<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-interconnection-load-forecast-data-center-ev-dominion-firstenergy/704040/" target="_blank">
according to <em>Utility Dive</em></a>. PJM attributes the big jump to a
few factors, calling out specifically data centers, new manufacturing
plants, and more electrification, especially of transportation.
</p>
<p>
The PJM forecast provides a case study for the challenges the Biden
administration faces as it pursues the twin goals of lowering emissions
and decarbonizing the electricity sector, along with trying to revive
American manufacturing.
</p>
<p>
In order to reduce emissions, you can’t just replace fossil fuel-burning
power plants with renewable and non-carbon energy sources. Everything
else that emits carbon has to be decarbonized as well, including
transportation,<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106022#:~:text=and%20economic%20risks.-,The%20transportation%20sector%20is%20the%20largest%20source%20of%20greenhouse%20gas,to%20the%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
which makes up about 30% of emissions</a>.
</p>
<p>
But doing this increases demand for electricity — a car that used to be
powered by igniting gasoline is now powered by a battery that has to be
charged. Electrification will put even more pressure on non-carbon power
generation: not only do some combination of solar panels, wind turbines,
nuclear power plants, dams and steam have to replace existing
electricity demand, it has to make up for that new demand as well.
</p>
<p>
While there are ways to moderate this demand — you can pay consumers to
use less electricity at peak times and have electric car batteries work
as power supply for homes, for example — a world where electric power
replaces combustion will mean we need to find more electricity.
</p>
<p>
That’s no small task. There are about 500,000 electric cars in the PJM
area and the projection is that there will be 23 million by the end of
the next decade, while the number of medium and heavy-duty electric
vehicles will increase from 25,000 to 1.5 million, according to PJM’s
forecast.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s new sources of electricity demand that have nothing to
do with electrification, like,
say,<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/intel-in-ohio.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
a new semiconductor plant outside Columbus</a>, Ohio, being built by
Intel
or<a href="https://quantumloophole.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
data centers in Maryland</a>.
</p>
<p>
Right now, PJM’s existing electric load is serviced by a relatively
dirty grid that’s over half coal and natural gas (although one third
also comes from nuclear). PJM, like many electricity markets, has
expressed worries about how retiring fossil fuel plants could impact the
reliability of the grid as a whole. The new forecast “underscores the
need to maintain and develop enough generation resources to serve that
growing demand,” PJM’s senior vice president for planning Kenneth Seiler
said in a statement.

id="nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-is-anti-blur-monitor-tech-aimed-squarely-at-your-eyeball">Nvidia’s
G-Sync Pulsar is anti-blur monitor tech aimed squarely at your
eyeball</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Motion blur, when it’s not caused by slow LCD pixel transitions, is
caused by “the persistence of an image on the retina, as our eyes track
movement on-screen,” as Nvidia explains it. Prior improvements in
display tech, like variable rate refresh, Ultra Low Motion Blur, and
Variable Overdrive have helped with the hardware causes of this
deficiency. The eyes and their object permanence, however, can only be
addressed by strobing a monitor’s backlight. You can’t just set that
light blinking, however. Variable strobing frequencies causes flicker,
and timing the strobe to the monitor refresh rate—itself also tied to
the graphics card output—was tricky. Nvidia says it has solved that
issue with its G-Sync Pulsar tech, employing “a novel algorithm” in
“synergizing” its variable refresh smoothing and monitor pulsing. The
result is that pixels are transitioned from one color to another at a
rate that reduces motion blur and pixel ghosting. ↫ Kevin Purdy for Ars
Technica Cool technology, of course, but also another attempt by Nvidia
to put Nvidia-specific chips inside monitors to cash in on royalties and
tie people to Nvidia GPUs. Their previous attempt – G-Sync – was
eventually thwarted, but they’re clearly trying again.</p>

at some level a sign of broken consensus processes and various actors
trying to sidestep them, an assumption by many people that the docs are
“outdated” for not using flakes, and the bizarre proliferation of flakes
everywhere in blog posts or tutorials leading to a belief that they are
required for everything. This post is about how to architect Nix
projects in general, with a special eye on how to do so with flakes
while avoiding their limitations. It tries to dispel misconceptions that

<h2 id="every-single-day-of-2023-was-extraordinarily-hot">Every Single
Day of 2023 Was Extraordinarily Hot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAzNDgzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODcxODczMX0.n_XHAWmwIPO04IffUjKf6OKnSheXRXNlkQvAie_Mpqg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
You have almost certainly heard already that 2023 was,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/climate/2023-warmest-year-record.html" target="_blank">officially</a>,
the hottest year on record. That announcement came this morning from
<a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2023-hottest-year-record" target="_blank">Copernicus</a>,
the European Union’s Earth data service.
</p>
<p>
There was another figure in that announcement, however, that caught my
eye: 2023 was also the first year in which every single day was at least
1 degree Celsius hotter than the pre-industrial average.
</p>
<center>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
</center>
<p>
That is a marked contrast to 2022, our sixth hottest year on record,
which had several days less than 1 degree above the pre-industrial
average and a maximum temperature difference around half a degree lower
than last year’s.<br/>

</p>
</center>
<p>
Just for kicks, I decided to make the same chart for 1940, the earliest
year represented in this particular dataset. As you will perhaps notice,
I had to adjust the scale to account for temperatures <em>below</em> the
pre-industrial average.<br/>

The last time the global daily average temperature came in below the

‘Kidnapping’ Scams Target Chinese Students Around the World</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A recent cyber kidnapping incident involving a Chinese
exchange student in Utah appears to be part of an international pattern
in which unknown perpetrators, often masquerading as Chinese police or
government officials, target Chinese students around the world and
extort their families for upwards of tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>In late December, 17-year-old Chinese student Kai Zhuang was reported
missing near Salt Lake City, only to be found days later alone and
freezing in a tent in the mountains. Authorities have said the case was
part of an apparent cyber kidnapping scheme to scam his family in China
out of $80,000.</p>
<p>Cyber kidnapping is when perpetrators pretend to have abducted
someone to coerce their family into paying a ransom.</p>
<p>“At the heart of it are the heartstrings of the victim, who is told
to go run and hide, and the heartstrings of the people who think their
loved one is actually in the possession of kidnappers,” said Theresa
Payton, CEO of cybersecurity company Fortalice Solutions.</p>
<p>“Virtual kidnapping is, at its very root, manipulative. It is
coercive. It is emotionally draining and complex,” said Payton, who is
based in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
<p>On January 3, just days after Kai Zhuang was found, the FBI issued a
warning about criminals impersonating Chinese police officers to defraud
Chinese people based in the United States, especially Chinese
students.</p>
<p>Around the world</p>
<p>VOA has learned that the cyber scams aren’t targeting only Chinese
students studying in the United States.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Chinese students studying abroad in Australia,
Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan have also been targeted by cyber
kidnapping scams and other cybercrime schemes, VOA found.</p>
<p>In these countries, the perpetrators also often pretended to be
Chinese police officers or government officials. Cybersecurity experts
said this tactic indicates criminals are leveraging China’s
authoritarian system, in which deference to and fear of the police are
the norm, to their advantage.</p>
<p>“Chinese people are naturally afraid of the police,” said Han Jiang
Du Diao Seng, a pharmacist based in the United States who runs accounts
on YouTube and Weibo that are popular among Chinese exchange
students.</p>
<p>Han Jiang Du Diao Seng has helped four Chinese students caught up in
cyber kidnapping scams, he said. In his experience, he said, scammers
posing as government officials tend to approach Chinese students and
first ask if they recently received money from their family in
China.</p>
<p>If the student says yes, he said, the scammer either claims the money
was transferred illegally or that their family is being targeted by
criminals, before requiring the student to halt contact with their
family during an investigation — all of which is a ploy to then extort
money from the family.</p>
<p>Left their homes</p>
<p>In the incidents Han Jiang Du Diao Seng worked on, he said, the
criminals coerced all the students to leave where they lived and go stay
at a hotel, which helped convince their parents that they were actually
kidnapped.</p>
<p>He said that these criminals may be taking advantage of the fact that
Chinese parents may be less likely to report the incidents to American
police — in part due to language barriers but also due to general
distrust among Chinese people of the American police. Chinese state
media regularly depict American police as violent and irresponsible.</p>
<p>“You have a fear of government involvement and law enforcement
involvement because the relationship to the government is different,”
cybersecurity expert Joseph Steinberg said, referring to people from
authoritarian countries such as China.</p>
<p>There is no clear data on the number of cyber kidnapping cases in the
United States or around the world, cybersecurity experts told VOA, but
incidents seem to be rising. Technological advancements, particularly
with artificial intelligence, risk making the schemes even easier to
perpetrate, they said.</p>
<p>There are different tiers of sophistication in these cybercrime
syndicates, according to Payton. At the lower end, perpetrators may use
an auto dialer to target random people in hopes of getting a few hundred
dollars, she said.</p>
<p>More sophisticated schemes</p>
<p>At the upper end, perpetrators use artificial intelligence algorithms
to identify targets and deepfake technology to create photos and audio
intended to make victims believe their loved one has actually been
kidnapped, Payton said.</p>
<p>“You do not actually have to be technically minded to get into this
type of crime. You just have to be a twisted, evil individual,” she
said.</p>
<p>AI advancements mean perpetrators don’t even need to speak the same
language as their victims, according to Steinberg, who is based in New
York City.</p>
<p>“AI is only going to get better, and that means that the attacks will
only be more and more realistic,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Some cybercriminals are just after a quick buck, Steinberg said. “But
you have some that are after the big dollars and will spend the time to
do the research,” he said.</p>
<p>That may help explain why Chinese exchange students apparently are
being specifically targeted.</p>
<p>Payton said that given the complex relationship between the Chinese
government and its citizens, as well as other factors such as culture,
history and economics, “it is conceivable that global criminal
syndicates engaging in such activities as virtual kidnapping may
perceive young Chinese adults studying abroad as more susceptible to
fall prey to this crime,” Payton said.</p>
<p>In Canada in February 2023, regional police said Chinese students had
been swindled out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by scammers
claiming to be Chinese government officials.</p>
<p>Similar incidents have played out in Australia, Japan and the United
Kingdom. It is not clear whether the perpetrators of any of these crimes
are linked in any way. The investigation into the recent Utah incident
is ongoing, and it is not clear whether the perpetrators imitated
Chinese officials.</p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington did not respond to that question when
VOA reached out for comment.</p>
<p>Warnings from embassies and police</p>
<p>The embassy did urge Chinese citizens in the U.S., especially those
studying in the country, to boost safety awareness, take necessary
precautions, and stay vigilant against “virtual kidnapping” and other
forms of telecom and online fraud.</p>
<p>In the span of two months in Japan last summer, at least six Chinese
students were targeted in cyber kidnapping schemes, local police said.
The Chinese Embassy in Tokyo issued a warning about the scams in August,
urging Chinese citizens in the country to “be wary” and “vigilant.”</p>
<p>Local British police issued a warning about cyber scams targeting
Chinese students in September, and the Australian government released a
similar warning a month later.</p>
<p>“These criminal syndicates demonstrate a profound understanding of
human behavior, potentially leveraging fear tactics to manipulate
individuals into compliance and their families into making payments.
They are targeting all demographics, but the trend appears to indicate
they favor targeting Chinese exchange students studying abroad,” Payton
said.</p>
<p>To avoid falling victim to these kinds of schemes, cybersecurity
experts recommended families set up a password to verify one another’s
identity over the phone during these kinds of scenarios.</p>
<p>“The cyber kidnapping scam very much can happen to anybody, and
that’s what people need to be aware of,” Steinberg said.</p>

<h2 id="us-delays-planned-return-of-astronauts-to-moon-until-2026">US
Delays Planned Return of Astronauts to Moon Until 2026</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States is pushing back its planned return of
astronauts to the surface of the Moon from 2025 to 2026, NASA
Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Artemis, named after the sister of Apollo in Greek mythology, was
officially announced in 2017 as part of the US space agency’s plans to
establish a sustained presence on Earth’s nearest space neighbor, and
apply lessons learned there for a future mission to Mars.</p>
<p>Its first mission, an uncrewed test flight to the Moon and back
called Artemis 1, took place in 2022, after several postponements.</p>
<p>Artemis 2, involving a crew that doesn’t land on the surface, has
been postponed from later this year to September 2025, Nelson told
reporters.</p>
<p>Artemis 3, in which the first woman and first person of color are to
set foot on lunar soil at the Moon’s south pole, should now take place
in September 2026.</p>
<p>“Safety is our top priority, and to give Artemis teams more time to
work through the challenges,” said Nelson.</p>
<p>NASA is also looking to build a lunar space station called Gateway
where spacecraft will dock during later missions.</p>
<p>Elon Musk’s SpaceX has won the contract for a landing system for
Artemis 3 based on a version of its prototype Starship rocket, which
remains far from ready. Both of its orbital tests have ended in
explosions.</p>
<p>Delays to Starship have knock-on effects because the spacesuit
contractor needs to know how the suits will interface with the
spacecraft, and simulators need to be built for astronauts to learn its
systems.</p>
<p>And the Artemis 1 mission itself revealed technical issues, such as
the heat shield on the Orion crew capsule eroded in an unexpected way,
and the ground structure used to launch the giant SLS rocket sustained
more damage than expected.</p>
<p>As of March 2023, NASA has agreed to pay approximately $40 billion to
hundreds of contractors in support of Artemis, the same watchdog
found.</p>
<p>A key difference between the 20th-century Apollo missions and the
Artemis era is the increasing role of commercial partnerships, part of a
broader strategy to involve the private companies in space exploration
to reduce costs and to make space more accessible.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-from-moving-house">Quotes from moving house</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/moving.jpg" width="1200" height="630" alt="drawing of a cardboard box and some bubble wrap in an empty room">
<p>
I’ve moved house over sixteen times in my lifetime (more if you count
step-homes). Apartment to house, city to city, state to state, country
to country; I’ve done it all. I’ve even lived in a couple
pseudo-communes with over 6+ roommates. Thinking back, I realized I have
little phrases –some synesthetic little audio cues– attached to each
major life change. Here’s a handful of my favorites.
</p>
<h2>
“Always WATCH YOUR BACK.”
</h2>
<p>
In 2003 I got accepted to JET Programme and would be moving to Japan for
one to three years. You apply in December, interview in January, get
accepted in April, and leave in July. It’s a sudden transition for an
overseas move. In April I found out I’d be living in a small town called
Sasayama in Hyogo Prefecture. It looked cute, had a castle, and the
town’s website had an animated gif of a dancing mayor. Part of the JET
Programme’s tradition is that your predecessor writes you a little note
introducing the town and job before you arrive. In July I got an email
and inside was the following phrase repeated seven times…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Always WATCH YOUR BACK.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yikes. It’s two weeks or so before I board a plane to live in a country
I’ve never even visited. Although self-evident by the tone of the
letter, I later learned my predecessor had a hard time in our small
town. She entered a relationship with another JET teacher and when they
wanted to live together that caused a local stir where city hall got
involved. That’s small town life for you.
</p>
<p>
What an ominous letter to get before you move overseas!
</p>
<h2>
“Do you like breakfast?”
</h2>
<p>
We rolled up to our house in South Austin in a bright yellow Penske
truck. We trekked across the desert from California and would officially
become homeowners that day. As we were unloading the truck a neighbor in
her mid seventies stepped out to meet us. She was so kind and after some
small talk she asked a question I’ll never forget…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Do you like breakfast?”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And that began almost 9 years of weekly breakfasts at Dan’s Hamburgers
with our neighbor Cleo. She’s more than a sweet grandmotherly neighbor
to our children, she was their best friend. Every day my kids would wake
up and demand to go see Cleo.
</p>
<p>
I also can’t forget our eighty year old neighbor Nellie’s big entrance
after meeting Cleo. Fresh from cataracts surgery wearing a night gown
and an eye-patch, she stumbled across her yard into the street to start
giving us all the gossip we could ask for on the neighborhood. “That’s
old Gene and his wife died…”, “She’s an old maid…”, and another line
I’ll never forget…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Tread lightly with them over there…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
About as Texan as it gets. We stayed in that house nine years and saw
the street turnover. We outgrew our 2 bedroom/2 bath house, so we moved
north in 2018. There’s lots to miss about the old place (big yard,
proximity to Dan’s Hamburgers), but we miss our friend Cleo the most.
</p>
<h2>
“We mow our lawns and decorate for Halloween”
</h2>
<p>
When I introduced myself to my new neighbor in North Austin, she was
friendly but a bit somber as she mentioned her husband passed away six
months prior. She welcomed us to the neighborhood, asked about our kids,
and then proceeded to lay out the two ground rules for the street…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We mow our lawns and decorate for Halloween.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I felt shame looking down at my unkempt yard. She handed me a business
card for her mowers and I hired them that day. And she wasn’t kidding
about Halloween. Our street is basically <em>the</em> street in the
neighborhood for Halloween. We have a 9-foot tall inflatable Beetlejuice
sand worm in our yard every October, so I like to think we’re fulfilling
our neighborly obligations… but my yard still looks like shit.

Happened When Solar Installers in New York Tried to Unionize</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAwNDM1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNDgwNDQzOH0.eBm8O5DZ6GeVDdAZBopDaJGAZpWYNeZ69uQtkreFIdQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
President Biden’s pitch to get the American public behind the transition
to clean energy is that it will bring good-paying, high-quality jobs —
union jobs. But so far, that’s been more true in some areas than others.
</p>
<p>
When Daniel Lozano first got hired at EmPower Solar, a rooftop solar
installation company on Long Island last April, he thought he had landed
a pretty sweet gig. He was 24, with a background in electrical work and
construction, and was attracted by the company’s summer schedule of four
tens — four-day work weeks, ten hours per day.
</p>
<p>
But soon it became clear the job wasn’t as ideal as it seemed. Extreme
pressure from management to finish installations as quickly as possible
was wearing people down. Workers felt overworked and underpaid. An
opaque bonus system and frequent firing and hiring created an atmosphere
of anxiety. Vacation requests took months to approve. Lozano grew
especially frustrated that his manager kept delaying his scheduled
performance review — and therefore his prospects for a raise.
</p>
<p>
All the while, Lozano watched as the UPS Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers were waging historic campaigns to try to increase pay for their
workers. Inspired by their success, he began trying to organize at
EmPower.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want to be treated like dogs that are just pushed and pushed
and pushed and then let go like used rags,” he told me. “We can make
this a good place to work.”
</p>
<p>
The number of solar workers represented by a union has been creeping up
over the last decade, reaching about 10.5% of the workforce in 2022,
according to the most recent
<a href="https://irecusa.org/census-executive-summary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National
Solar Jobs Census</a>. By comparison, about 16% of autoworkers and about
48% of electric power line workers were members of a union that year,
according to the
<a href="https://unionstats.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union
Membership and Coverage Database</a>, which is built on federal data.
</p>
<p>
But most union clean energy work is on big commercial projects like
utility-scale solar farms, where developers have to pay prevailing
wages, use apprentices, or enter into project labor agreements in order
to qualify for state and federal subsidies. Union representation is much
more unusual in residential work like rooftop solar, where rebates and
tax credits typically have no labor requirements.
</p>
<p>
Residential construction is a fragmented industry, with lots of small
businesses that employ only a handful of people. In some ways, EmPower
stands out in this field. The company has a staff of more than 100 and
offers full benefits like paid time off, health insurance, and a 401k
retirement plan. But many of the complaints workers had about EmPower
are common in the industry. A
<a href="https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Putting-California-on-the-High-Road.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2020
report</a> by the California Workforce Development Board, for example,
says that rooftop solar and energy efficiency jobs there “are
characterized by low wages” and “lack of career ladders.”
</p>
<p>
The primary union for solar workers to date has been the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. But Lozano thought the group seemed
stagnant — its leadership wasn’t out there the way that Shawn Fain, the
progressive UAW president, was, fighting for its workers in the national
spotlight, Lozano said. So instead, in September, he went to see if his
local UAW chapter would represent EmPower workers. They agreed. Next,
Lozano began gathering support from his coworkers and soon had enough to
schedule an official vote with the National Labor Relations Board.
</p>
<p>
The company’s leadership did not welcome the organizing effort. In the
weeks leading up to the vote, EmPower hired National Labor Relations
Advocates, a strategy firm that
<a href="https://nlradvocates.com/union-election-campaigns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promises</a>,
“within 24 hours of being retained,” to “arm you with the tools you need
and bring our experience and 96% success rate in keeping our clients
union-free.” According to Lozano and other workers, management began
visiting job sites with coffee and donuts and asking about their
concerns. They said the company was a family, and that any issues they
had would be resolved more slowly with a union, not faster.
</p>
<p>
The workers weren’t convinced. On December 22, EmPower’s installers and
service technicians voted 29 to 16 in favor of unionizing.
</p>
<p>
One week later, on the Friday before the new year, the company notified
21 workers — including Lozano — that they were being put on unpaid
leave, some for more than a year. Michael DiGiuseppe, the vice president
of UAW Local 259, accused the company of illegally retaliating against
the unionization effort and filed charges with the National Labor
Relations Board.
</p>
<p>
“One week out, we wanted to find collaborative bargaining priorities,
and instead of doing that, they went out and laid off 21 guys,”
DiGiuseppe told me.
</p>
<p>
EmPower said it furloughed the workers because business typically slows
down in the winter, and the company took a particularly hard hit in 2023
due to soaring interest rates and inflation. (It is continuing to
provide health insurance for those who were furloughed.) But regardless
of whether the layoffs were retaliatory, they still violated the
National Labor Relations Act, according to DiGiuseppe. Once workers have
voted to unionize, an employer is not allowed to make any changes to the
covered workers’ terms or conditions without notifying and negotiating
with the union, even if the changes are pure business decisions. “At a
minimum, they should have communicated with us that they were laying off
workers,” DiGiuseppe said.
</p>
<p>
I spoke with three other field workers from EmPower, in addition to
Lozano, who had been with the company for several years, and had also
been furloughed. When I asked why they wanted to unionize, the workers,
who requested not to be named, echoed many of Lozano’s grievances. They
described an atmosphere of pressure to work fast, even in riskier
situations, such as when they were installing panels on steeply pitched
roofs or working with electrical equipment in the rain. They didn’t like
that they were blamed, yelled at, and sometimes docked pay when things
broke or went wrong. Many of their complaints were around compensation,
including not being paid for travel time or for taking on additional
responsibilities. One of the workers, like Lozano, was frustrated by
performance review delays that left no clear pathway to a raise. Another
described how the company awarded bonuses to workers based on their
speed and adherence to safety protocols, but said the scoring system was
mysterious and seemed to be inconsistent from job to job.
</p>
<p>
In general, the workers told me, they liked their jobs at EmPower and
wanted to stay there, but were seeking more transparency,
accountability, and standardization.
</p>
<p>
David Schieren, the CEO of EmPower and chairman of the New York State
Solar Energy Industry Association, rejected the workers’
characterization of the company. When I asked about the pressure to work
quickly, Schieren said this was the nature of running a customer-centric
business. “We have one boss,” he told me. “The boss is the consumer.
They tell us, do we want to work with this company or not? Are they
happy or are they not?”
</p>
<p>
If workers were uncomfortable with the pace, Schieren went on, then
maybe this wasn’t the right job for them. “We are hungry, we do
efficient work, we’re productive,” he said. “So that’s what I think we
promote here at EmPower. I think that a lot of employees feel that they
thrive in that environment. Is everybody right for a highly productive
company? I don’t know, maybe some people don’t want that.”
</p>
<p>
Schieren said the company had a track record of upward mobility,
including promoting 20 field team members to leadership in recent years,
and that workers had an average tenure with the company of more than 5
years. He declined to weigh in on whether he supported having a union at
his company. When I asked whether he thought unionization threatened the
business, he said no.
</p>
<p>
There is
<a href="https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/prevailing-wage-in-solar-can-deliver-good-jobs-while-keeping-growth-on-track/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a>
showing that paying solar workers prevailing wages does not
significantly increase the cost of solar. But there’s another calculus
to consider in all of this, beyond the economics of any one company or
technology. Proponents of unionization — including those in the federal
government —
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/good-jobs-good-pay-and-benefits-are-key-building-clean-energy-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say</a>
that making sure clean energy jobs are good jobs is essential to
building the political will to address the climate crisis.
</p>
<p>
As we enter the next stage of the transition, where climate solutions
like electric vehicles and wind turbines are becoming increasingly
politicized and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/texas-grid-cold-uri" target="_self">one
bad power outage</a> can invite endless litigation over the reliability
of renewables, clean energy companies may want workers on their side.

<p>Free speech is a constitutional right in the United States, but it
only protects against censorship by the government. Social media
platforms, businesses and private schools can each have their own

<h2 id="half-the-world-to-vote-in-2024-with-global-ramifications">Half
the World to Vote in 2024, With Global Ramifications</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — 2024 will pose a major test of democratic rule as an
estimated 4 billion people in more than 50 nations — almost half the
world’s population — are set to vote in national elections, with the
outcomes likely to shape global politics for years or decades to
come.</p>
<p>Bangladesh began 2024 with the first major election of the year as
Sheikh Hasina won a fourth consecutive term as prime minister Sunday.
Opposition parties boycotted the vote over complaints that it was
neither free nor fair.</p>
<p>A crucial presidential election is due to take place on the
self-governing island of Taiwan on January 13. China’s threat to retake
the island by force looms over the vote, with political parties divided
on how to approach Beijing.</p>
<p>“We are not only choosing Taiwan’s future leaders to decide on the
country’s future but also deciding on the peace and stability of the
Indo-Pacific region,” William Lai, the presidential candidate for the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, told supporters at a campaign rally
earlier this month. Lai is ahead in the polls.</p>
<p>In February, Indonesia is set to choose a new president to rule the
nation of 277 million people, making it one of the world’s biggest votes
held on a single day.</p>
<p>Pakistan will hold parliamentary elections in February; opposition
leader and former Prime Minister Imran Khan remains jailed on charges of
leaking state secrets, which he denies.</p>
<p>Russians will vote in presidential elections in March — although
observers predict incumbent Vladimir Putin is all but certain to win as
he is able to control the electoral process and state media.</p>
<p>“Putin is not going to have any genuine opponents,” said Ian Bond of
the Center for European Reform. “He has control of all the
administrative machinery required to make sure that a crushing vote in
favor of him is delivered and we get another six years of Putin up to at
least 2030.”</p>
<p>Largest democracy</p>
<p>India — the world’s biggest democracy — will hold parliamentary
elections in April and May, with the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP,
under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ahead in the polls.</p>
<p>Veteran Indian political journalist Pushp Saraf believes the
opposition will struggle to make headway.</p>
<p>“It all depends how united they are,” Saraf said. “Otherwise, if they
stay disunited, as they appear to be many times, they have little chance
of succeeding against BJP, which is organizationally very strong, and
with Narendra Modi, who is riding high on the popularity wave, at least
in the Hindi heartland.”</p>
<p>“These are very significant elections because there are clearly two
opinions in the country at the moment. One is that BJP is polarizing
society along the communal lines. And on the other hand, there is the
opinion that BJP is focusing more on national security,” Saraf told The
Associated Press.</p>
<p>On June 2, Mexico is due to hold its presidential election, which
could herald a new milestone for the country, “because of the
possibility that, for the first time, a woman will govern Mexico,”
according to Mexican pollster Patricio Morelos. Mexico’s ruling party
has selected Claudia Sheinbaum, a former mayor of Mexico City, as its
candidate.</p>
<p>The European Union, representing more than half-a-billion people, is
set to hold parliamentary elections in June. Polls suggest a resurgence
in support for right-wing populist parties in many countries, including
France, Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>“There is a real possibility, I think, that the far right will do
well in European elections. Not to the point of running the European
Parliament, but conceivably to the point where anyone who wants to run
the European Parliament has to take account of what they’re saying and
doing,” Anand Menon, professor of international politics at Kings
College London, told VOA.</p>
<p>Britain is scheduled to hold elections before the end of the year,
with polls suggesting opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer is on
course to end a tumultuous 14 years of Conservative rule, with five
different prime ministers.</p>
<p>“We had the Brexit wars that dominated everything, then we had
COVID-19, now we’ve got the cost-of-living crisis. We’ve had government
instability… the instability itself has become a political issue,” Menon
said.</p>
<p>On November 5, the United States is due to hold a highly anticipated
presidential election as Americans decide whether to give Democrat Joe
Biden a second term as U.S. president or choose a Republican
alternative, with Donald Trump seemingly his most likely opponent —
although the challenger faces numerous legal hurdles in the run up to
the vote.</p>
<p>Worldwide effects</p>
<p>The impact of many of these elections in 2024 will likely be felt
around the world, said analyst Menon.</p>
<p>“Yes, all politics is local — but there are global trends.
Immigration is going to figure a lot in many elections around the world.
It will figure in the U.S. election, it will figure in the European
elections, it will figure in the U.K. election,” Memon said.</p>
<p>“Insecurity will be a major factor. One of the things we’re living
with in the West now is an increased sense of insecurity, both economic
— but also in security terms, given the war that’s going on in Ukraine
and given the doubts about what the Taiwanese election later this month
might mean for Taiwan-Chinese relations.</p>
<p>“So, there are common factors, but those are refracted through the
prism of the local and domestic in each country, so they play out in
different ways,” Menon said.</p>

Kelly and Zach Weinersmith’s “A City On Mars” (09 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Kelly and Zach Weinersmith’s “A City On Mars”: Life in
space sucks, is grotesquely expensive, and produces little useful
science. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history:
2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Kelly and Zach
Weinersmith’s “A City On Mars” (permalink) In A City On Mars, biologist
Kelly Weinersmith and cartoonist Zach Weinersmith set out to investigate
the governance challenges of the impending space settlements they were
told were just over the horizon. Instead, they discovered that humans
aren’t going to be settling space for a very long time, and so they
wrote a book about that instead: https://www.acityonmars.com/ The
Weinersmiths make the (convincing) case that every aspect of space
settlement is vastly beyond our current or reasonably foreseeable
technical capability. What’s more, every argument in favor of pursuing
space settlement is errant nonsense. And finally: all the energy we are
putting into space settlement actually holds back real space science,
which offers numerous benefits to our species and planet (and is just
darned cool). Every place we might settle in space – giant rotating
rings, the Moon, Mars – is vastly more hostile than Earth. Not just more
hostile than Earth as it stands today – the most degraded,
climate-wracked, nuke-blasted Earth you can imagine is a paradise of
habitability compared to anything else. Mars is covered in poison and
the sky disappears under planet-sized storms that go on and on. The Moon
is covered in black-lung-causing, razor-sharp, electrostatically charged
dust. Everything is radioactive. There’s virtually no water. There are
temperature swings of hundreds of degrees every couple of hours or
weeks. You’re completely out of range of resupply, emergency help, or,
you know, air. There’s Helium 3 on the Moon, but not much of it, and
there is no universe in which is it cheaper to mine for Helium 3 on the
Moon than it is to mine for it on Earth. That’s generally true of
anything we might bring back from space, up to and including
continent-sized chunks of asteroid platinum. Going to space doesn’t end
war. The countries that have gone to space are among the most militarily
belligerent in human history. The people who’ve been to space have come
back perfectly prepared to wage war. Going to space won’t save us from
the climate emergency. The unimaginably vast trove of material and the
energy and advanced technology needed to lift it off Earth and get it to
Mars is orders of magnitude more material and energy than we would need
to resolve the actual climate emergency here. We aren’t anywhere near
being a “multiplanetary species.” The number of humans you need in a
colony to establish a new population is hard to estimate, but it’s very
large. Larger than we can foreseeably establish on the Moon, on Mars, or
on a space-station. But even if we could establish such a colony,
there’s little evidence that it could sustain itself – not only are we a
very, very long way off from such a population being able to satisfy its
material needs off-planet, but we have little reason to believe that
children could gestate, be born, and grow to adulthood off-planet. To
top it all off, there’s space law – the inciting subject matter for this
excellent book. There’s a lot of space law, and while there are some
areas of ambiguity, the claims of would-be space entrepreneurs about how
their plans are permissible under the settled parts of space law don’t
hold up. But those claims are robust compared to claims that space law
will simply sublimate into its constituent molecules when exposed to the
reality of space travel, space settlement, and (most importantly) space
extraction. Space law doesn’t exist in a vacuum (rimshot). It is
parallel to – and shares history with – laws regarding Antarctica, the
ocean’s surface, and the ocean’s floor. These laws relate to territories
that are both vastly easier to access and far more densely populated by
valuable natural resources. The fact that they remain operative in the
face of economic imperatives demands that space settlement advocates
offer a more convincing account than “money talks, bullshit walks, space
law is toast the minute we land on a $14 quadrillion platinum asteroid.”
The Weinersmiths have such an account in defense of space law: namely,
that space law, and its terrestrial analogs, constitute a durable means
of resolving conflicts that would otherwise give rise to outcomes that
are far worse for science, entrepreneurship, human thriving or
nation-building than the impediments these laws represent. What’s more,
space law is enforceable. Not only would any space settlement be
terribly, urgently dependent on support from Earth for the
long-foreseeable future, but every asteroid miner, Lunar He3 exporter
and Martian potato-farmer hoping to monetize their products would have
an enforcement nexus with a terrestrial nation and thus the courts of
that nation. But the Weinersmiths aren’t anti-space. They aren’t even
anti-space-settlement. Rather, they argue that the path to space-based
scientific breakthroughs, exploration of our solar system, and a deeper
understanding of our moral standing in a vast universe cannot start with
space settlements. Landing people on the Moon or Mars any time soon is a
stunt – a very, very expensive stunt. These boondoggles aren’t just
terribly risky (though they are – people who attempt space settlement
are very likely to die horribly and after not very long), they come with
price-tags that would pay for meaningful space science. For the price of
a crewed return trip to Mars, you could put multiple robots onto every
significant object in our solar system, and pilot an appreciable fleet
of these robot explorers back to Earth with samples. For the cost of a
tiny, fraught, lethal Moon-base, we could create hundreds of experiments
in creating efficient, long-term, closed biospheres for human life.
That’s the crux of the Weinersmiths’ argument: if you want to establish
space settlements, you need to do a bunch of other stuff first, like
figure out life-support, learn more about our celestial neighbors, and
vastly improve our robotics. If you want to create stable
space-settlements, you’ll need to create robust governance systems –
space law that you can count on, rather than space law that you plan on
shoving out the airlock. If you want humans to reproduce in space – a
necessary precondition for a space settlement that lasts more than a
single human lifespan – then we need to do things like breed multiple
generations of rodents and other animals, on space stations. Space is
amazing. Space science is amazing. Crewed scientific space missions are
amazing. But space isn’t amazing because it offers a “Plan B” for an
Earth that is imperiled by humanity’s recklessness. Space isn’t amazing
because it offers unparalleled material wealth, or unlimited energy, or
a chance to live without laws or governance. It’s not amazing because it
will end war by mixing the sensawunda of the “Pale Blue Dot” with the
lebensraum of an infinite universe. A science-driven approach to space
offers many dividends for our species and planet. If we can figure out
how to extract resources as dispersed as Lunar He3 or asteroid ice,
we’ll have solved problems like extracting tons of gold from the ocean
or conflict minerals from landfill sites, these being several orders of
magnitude more resource-dense than space. If we can figure out how to
create self-sustaining terraria for large human populations in the
radiation-, heat- and cold-blasted environs of space, we will have
learned vital things about our own planet’s ecosystems. If we can build
the robots that are necessary for supporting a space society, we will
have learned how to build robots that take up the most dangerous and
unpleasant tasks that human workers perform on Earth today. In other
words, it’s not just that we should solve Earth’s problems before
attempting space settlement – it’s that we can’t settle space until we
figure out the solutions to Earth’s problems. Earth’s problems are far
simpler than the problems of space settlement. As I read the
Weinersmiths’ critique of space settlement, I kept thinking of the
pointless AI debates I keep getting dragged into. Arguments for space
settlement that turn on existential risks (like humanity being wiped out
by comets, sunspots, nuclear armageddon or climate collapse) sound an
awful lot like the arguments about “AI safety” – the “risk” that the
plausible sentence generator is on the verge of becoming conscious and
turning us all into paperclips. Both arguments are part of a sales-pitch
for investment in commercial ventures that have no plausible commercial
case, but whose backers are hoping to get rich anyway, and are (often)
sincerely besotted with their own fantasies:
https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/
Both AI and space settlement pass over the real risks, such as the
climate consequences of their deployment, or the labor conditions
associated with their production. After all, when you’re heading off
existential risk, you don’t stop to worry about some carbon emissions or
wage theft. And critically, both ignore the useful (but resolutely
noncommercial) ways that AI or space science can benefit our species. AI
radiology analysis might be useful as an adjunct to human radiological
analysis, but that is more expensive, not less. Space science might help
us learn to use our materials more efficiently on Earth, and that will
come long before anyone makes rendezvous with a $14 quadrillion platinum
asteroid. There are beneficial uses for LLMs. When the Human Rights Data
Analysis Group uses an LLM to help the Innocence Project New Orleans
extract and categorize officer information from wrongful conviction
records, they are doing something valuable and important:
https://hrdag.org/tech-notes/large-language-models-IPNO.html It’s
socially important work, a form of automation that is an unalloyed good,
but you won’t hear about it from LLM advocates. No one is gonna get rich
on improving the efficiency of overturning wrongful convictions with
natural language processing. You can’t inflate a stock bubble with the
Innocence Project. By the same token, learning about improving
gestational health by breeding multigenerational mouse families in
geosynchronous orbit is no way to get a billionaire tech baron to commit
$250 billion to space science. But that’s not an argument against
emphasizing real science that really benefits our whole species. It’s an
argument for taking away capital allocation authority from tech
billionaires. I’m a science fiction writer. I love stories about space.
But I can distinguish fantasy from reality and thought experiments from
suggestions. Kim Stanley Robinson’s 2015 novel Aurora – about failed
space settlement – is every bit as fascinating and inspirational as
“golden age” sf:
https://memex.craphound.com/2015/11/02/kim-stanley-robinsons-aurora-space-is-bigger-than-you-think/
But still, it inspired howls of outrage from would-be space colonists.
So much so that Stan wrote a brilliant essay explaining what we were all
missing about space settlement, which I published:
https://boingboing.net/2015/11/16/our-generation-ships-will-sink.html
With City on Mars, the Weinersmiths aren’t making the case for giving up
on space, nor are they trying to strip space of its romance and
excitement. They’re trying to get us to focus on the beneficial,
exciting, serious space science we can do right now, not just because
it’s attainable and useful – but because it is a necessary precondition
for any actual space settlement in the distant future. Hey look at this

<p>
The <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">MNT

If iFixIt did a teardown, they’d probably give it an 11 out of 10.
</p>
<p>
You can replace <em>individual battery cells!</em> Some people with
these laptops hacked in their own speakers, added more internal
Ethernet, or even swapped out the CPU itself.

<p>
Does that mean I think you should buy it? No, probably not. It’s
expensive (<a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">starting
at €1199</a>), and it’s built for a certain type of person. It’s not
gonna replace a MacBook or a cheap Chromebook.

But why does this exist, and why am I excited about it?

<h3>
Cruise
</h3>
The most obvious symptom is the implosion of General Motors’ Cruise
robotaxi division. Brad Templeton worked on autonomy at Waymo and is an
enthusiast for the technology. But in
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2023/12/28/robocar-2023-in-review-the-fall-of-cruise/"><i>Robocar
2023 In Review: The Fall Of Cruise</i></a> he acknowledges that things
aren’t going well:<br />
<blockquote>
Looking at 2023 in review for self-driving cars, one story stands out as
the clear top story of the year, namely the fall of General Motors’
“Cruise” robotaxi division, which led to a pause of operations for
Cruise over the whole USA, a ban on operations in California, the
resignation of the founder/CEO and much more. That was actually the most
prominent component of the other big story of the year, namely the
battle between San Francisco and both Cruise and Waymo.<br /> <br />
Even this serious mistake should not have and perhaps would not have
driven Cruise to its fate. The bigger mistake was they did not want to
talk about it. They were eager to show the car’s recorded video of
events to the press, and to officials, but only over Zoom. They did not
mention the dragging, even when asked about it. I did not ask to see the
part of the video after the crash, but others who did see it say it
ended before the dragging. The DMV states they were not shown the
dragging, and Cruise did not tell them about it, including in a letter
they sent shortly after the events. Cruise insists they did show the
full video to the DMV, and the DMV insists otherwise, but there is
little doubt that they were not open about what was obviously the most
important part of the chain of events when it came to understanding the
role of the robotaxi in the calamity. Cruise was very eager to show that
the initial crash was not their fault, but didn’t want to talk at all
about their own serious mistake.
</blockquote>
Laura Dobberstein reports on part of the aftermath in
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/gms_cruise_sacrifices_9_execs/"><i>GM’s
Cruise sheds nine execs in the name of safety and
integrity</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
GM’s self-driving taxi outfit, Cruise, has dismissed nine execs –
including its chief operating officer – after staff withheld information
regarding an incident in which a woman was injured by one of the firm’s
robotaxis.<br /> <br /> “Today, following an initial analysis of the
October 2 incident and Cruise’s response to it, nine individuals
departed Cruise. These include key leaders from Legal, Government
Affairs, and Commercial Operations, as well as Safety and Systems,” a
Cruise spokesperson told <i>The Register</i>.<br /> <br /> “As a
company, we are committed to full transparency and are focused on
rebuilding trust and operating with the highest standards when it comes
to safety, integrity, and accountability and believe that new leadership
is necessary to achieve these goals,” the spokesperson added.
</blockquote>
It isn’t just the executives who are feeling the pain, as Hayden Field
and Michael Wayland report in
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/gms-cruise-laying-off-900-or-24percent-of-its-workforce.html"><i>GM’s
Cruise laying off 900 employees, or 24% of its workforce: Read the memo
here</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Cruise on Thursday announced internally that it will lay off 900
employees, or 24% of its workforce, the company confirmed to CNBC.<br />
<br /> The layoffs, which primarily affected commercial operations and
related corporate functions, are the latest turmoil for the robotaxi
startup and come one day after Cruise
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/gms-cruise-dismisses-nine-key-leaders-amid-safety-probe.html">dismissed
nine “key leaders”</a> for the company’s response to an Oct. 2 accident
in which a pedestrian was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise self-driving car
after being struck by another vehicle.<br /> <br /> The company had
3,800 employees before Thursday’s cuts, which also follow a round of
contractor layoffs at Cruise last month.
</blockquote>
Templeton’s main argument is that Cruise mishandled the PR problem
resulting from their vehicle dragging an injured pedestrian. They
certainly did, in particular by apparently concealing information from
the Dept. of Motor Vehicles. But the PR problem they faced is generic to
autonomous vehicles. They are marketed as being safer than human drivers
and, statistically, this may even be true. Waymo certainly makes a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/human-drivers-crash-a-lot-more-than-waymos-software-data-shows/">plausible
claim</a>. But although “safer” implies it does not mean “safe”, so
serious crashes will inevitably occur.<br /> <br /> When they do the
company’s PR department is in a no-win situation. The reporters who call
asking for the company’s reaction know that the company has a vast
amount of detailed information about what happened, logs and video. But
the PR people don’t, and even if they did they don’t have the skills to
interpret it. Given the nature of the AI driving the vehicle, it will
take considerable time for the engineers to find the bug that was the
root cause.<br /> <br /> The honest thing for the PR people to say is
“we don’t have the details, we’ll get back to you when we do”. Reporters
are likely to hear this as buying time for a cover-up.<br /> <br /> The
wrong thing for them to do is to give the reporters what little they
know, and spin it in ways that minimize the company’s fault. Later, when
the full details emerge, they will have been shown to have been covering
up the worst. Next time, even if they are honest, they won’t be
believed.<br /> <br /> The PR problem is even worse because it is
fundamentally asymmetric. The marketing pitch is that, statistically,
autonomous vehicles cause less accidents than humans. But the public
will never know about accidents that would have happened were a human
driving, but were averted by the AI driver. They will know about
accidents that did happen because the AI driver did something that a
human would not have, as with the Uber and Cruise incidents. When set
against the expectation of airline-level safety, this is an insuperable
problem.<br /> <br /> In
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport"><i>Driverless
cars were the future but now the truth is out: they’re on the road to
nowhere</i></a>, Christian Wolmar who has a book about the autonomous
winter entitled
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driverless-Cars-Road-Nowhere-Perspectives/dp/1913019217/"><i>Driverless
Cars: On a Road to Nowhere?</i></a> points out that Cruise isn’t the
first robotaxi company felled by an accident. That would be Uber:<br />
<blockquote>
Right from the start, the hype far outpaced the technological advances.
In 2010, at the Shanghai Expo, General Motors had produced a video
showing a driverless car taking a pregnant woman to hospital at
breakneck speed and, as the commentary assured the viewers, safely. It
was precisely the promise of greater safety, cutting the terrible
worldwide annual roads death toll of 1.25m, that the sponsors of
driverless vehicles dangled in front of the public.<br /> <br /> And
that is now proving their undoing. First to go was Uber after an
accident in which one of its self-driving cars killed Elaine Herzberg in
Phoenix, Arizona. The car was in autonomous mode, and its “operator” was
accused of watching a TV show, meaning they did not notice when the car
hit Herzberg, who had confused its computers by stepping on to the
highway pushing a bike carrying bags on its handlebars. Fatally, the
computer could not interpret this confusing array of objects.<br />
<br /> Until then, Uber’s business model had been predicated on the idea
that within a few years it would dispense with drivers and provide a
fleet of robotaxis. That plan died with Herzberg, and Uber soon pulled
out of all its driverless taxi trials.
</blockquote>
In her
<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/12/self-driving-cars-hit-the-wall.html"><i>review
of Wolmar’s book</i></a> Yves Smith makes two good points:<br />
<blockquote>
Wolmar describes how this Brave New World has stalled out. The big
reason is that the world is too complicated. or to put it in Taleb-like
terms, there are way too many tail events to get them into training sets
for AI in cars to learn about them. The other issue, which Wolmar does
not make explicit, is that the public does not appear willing to accept
the sort of slip-shod tech standards of buggy consumer software. The
airline industry, which is very heavy regulated, has an impeccable
safety record, and citizens appear to expect something closer to
that…particularly citizens who don’t own or have investments in
self-driving cars and never consented to their risks.
</blockquote>
It isn’t just Cruise that is figuring out that
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/robotaxi-economics.html"><i>Robotaxi
Economics</i></a> don’t work. Rita Liao’s
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/"><i>Facing
roadblocks, China’s robotaxi darlings apply the brakes</i></a> reports
that they don’t work in China either:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite years of hype and progress in self-driving technologies, the
widespread availability of robotaxis remains a distant reality. That’s
due to a confluence of challenges, including safety, regulations and
costs.<br /> <br /> The last factor, in particular, is what has pushed
China’s robotaxi pioneers toward more opportunistic endeavors. To become
profitable, robotaxis need to eventually remove human operators. Though
China recently
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/china-autonomous-vehicle-driving-regulation/">clarified
rules around the need for human supervision</a>, taxis without a driver
behind the wheel are allowed only in restricted areas at present. To
attract customers, robotaxi services offer deep discounts on their paid
rides.<br /> <br /> Once the subsidies are gone and initial user
curiosity wanes, who’s willing to pay the same amount as taxi fares for
a few fixed routes?<br /> <br /> Struggling to address that question,
China’s robotaxi startups have woken up to the money-burning reality of
their business.
</blockquote>
So they are pivoting to a
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/">viable
product</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One logical path to monetize self-driving technology is to sell a less
robust version of the technology, namely, advanced driver assistance
systems (ADAS) that still require human intervention.<br /> <br />
Deeproute, which is backed by Alibaba, significantly scaled back its
robotaxi operations this year and plunged right into supplying ADAS to
automakers. Its production-ready solution, which includes its smart
driving software and lidar-powered hardware, is
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/05/autonomous-driving-darling-deeproute-ai-sets-sight-on-europe-carmakers/">sold
competitively at $2,000</a>. Similarly, Baidu is “downgrading the tech
stacks” to find paying customers on its way up what it calls the “Mount
Everest of self-driving.”<br /> <br /> “The experience and insight
gleaned from deploying our solutions in [mass-produced] vehicles is
being fed into our self-driving technology, giving us a unique moat
around security and data,” a Baidu spokesperson said.
</blockquote>
Not a good year for the robotaxi concept, the thing that was supposed to
distinguish Tesla’s cars from everyone else’s because they would earn
their owners money while they slept.<br />
<h3>
Tesla
</h3>
As usual, when it comes to self-driving Tesla’s story is worse than
almost everyone else’s. Elon Musk famously claimed that
<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-worth-zero-without-fsd-why-he-is-completely-wrong-191416.html">Tesla
is worth zero without Full Self Driving</a>. But although this is
typical Musk BS, but unlike some other utterances it contains a kernel
of truth. Tesla is valued as a <i>technology</i> company not a
<i>car</i> company. Thus it is critical for Telsa that its technology be
viewed as better than those of other car companies; anything that
suggests it is limited or inadequate is a big problem not just for the
company but also for Musk’s personal wealth.<br /> <br /> I believe this
is why Tesla hasn’t implemented effective driver monitoring nor
geo-fenced their systems. And why members of the Musk cult are so keen
on defeating the driver monitoring system with weights on the steering
wheel and smiley-face stickers on the camera. Depending upon what you
believe, the technology is either groundbreaking autonomy or a below
average Level-2 driver assistance system (Mercedes has fielded a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/mercedes-benzs-level-3-autonomous-driving-system-takes-over-in-heavy-traffic/">Level
3 system</a>). The congnitive dissonance between the pronouncements of
the cult leader and the reality of continually being “nagged” about the
limits of the technology is too hard for the cult members to take.<br />
<br /> The <i>Washington Post</i> team of Trisha Thadani, Rachel Lerman,
Imogen Piper, Faiz Siddiqui and Irfan Uraizee has been delivering
outstanding reporting on Tesla’s technology. They started on Octoober
6<sup>th</sup> with

A Tesla driving on Autopilot crashed through a T intersection at about
70 mph and flung the young couple into the air, killing Benavides Leon
and gravely injuring Angulo. In police body-camera footage obtained by
The Washington Post, the shaken driver says he was “driving on cruise”
and took his eyes off the road when he dropped his phone.<br /> <br />
But the 2019 crash reveals a problem deeper than driver inattention. It
occurred on a rural road where Tesla’s Autopilot technology was
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-cross-traffic/">not
designed to be used</a>. Dash-cam footage captured by the Tesla and
obtained exclusively by The Post shows the car blowing through a stop
sign, a blinking light and five yellow signs warning that the road ends
and drivers must turn left or right.
</blockquote>
Note that, just like the repeated
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-opens-formal-probe-tesla-autopilot_n_611a651de4b0f7bc26a7eef4">crashes
into emergency vehicles</a>, the victims did not volunteer to debug
Tesla’s software. And also that the Autopilot system was driving 15mph
above the speed limit on a road it wasn’t designed for, just like the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">2019
Banner crash</a> into a semi-trailer. As I wrote about
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-3.html">that
crash</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is typical of Tesla’s disdain for the law that, although their cars
have GPS and can therefore know the speed limit, they didn’t bother to
program Autopilot to obey the law.<br /> …<br /> Again, Tesla’s disdain
for the safety of their customers, not to mention other road users,
meant that despite the car knowing which road it was on and thus whether
it was a road that Autopilot should not be activated on, it allowed
Banner to enable it.
</blockquote>
Federal regulators have known there was a problem for more than seven
years, but they
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">haven’t
taken effective action</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Nor have federal regulators taken action. After the 2016 crash, which
killed Tesla driver Joshua Brown, the National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) called for limits on where driver-assistance technology
could be activated. But as a purely investigative agency, the NTSB has
no regulatory power over Tesla. Its peer agency, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is part of the Department
of Transportation, has the authority to establish enforceable auto
safety standards — but its failure to act has given rise to an unusual
and increasingly tense rift between the two agencies.
</blockquote>
The reason may be that car manufacturers “self-certify”
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">conformance
with safety standards</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">string
of Autopilot crashes</a> reveals the consequences of allowing a rapidly
evolving technology to operate on the nation’s roadways without
significant government oversight, experts say. While NHTSA has several
ongoing investigations into the company and specific crashes, critics
argue the agency’s approach is too reactive and has allowed a flawed
technology to put Tesla drivers — and those around them — at risk.<br />
<br /> The approach contrasts with federal regulation of planes and
railroads, where crashes involving new technology or equipment — such as
recurring issues with Boeing’s 737 Max — have resulted in sweeping
action by agencies or Congress to ground planes or mandate new safety
systems. Unlike planes, which are certified for airworthiness through a
process called “type certification,” passenger car models are not
prescreened, but are subject to a set of regulations called Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which manufacturers face the burden to
meet.
</blockquote>
And Tesla’s self-certification is self-serving.<br /> <br />
Self-certification would work well if the penalty for false
certification was severe, but the NTHSA has declined to impose
<i>any</i> penalty for Tesla’s manifestly inadequate system. It seems
that the team’s reporting finally drove the NHTSA to do <i>something</i>
about the long-standing problems of Autopilot. Reuters reported that
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/13/tesla-recall-us-autopilot"><i>Tesla
recalls more than 2m vehicles in US over Autopilot system</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla is recalling just over 2m vehicles in the United States fitted
with its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system to install new
safeguards, after a safety regulator said the system was open to
“foreseeable misuse”.<br /> <br /> The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) has been investigating the electric automaker led
by the billionaire Elon Musk for more than two years over whether Tesla
vehicles adequately ensure that drivers pay attention when using the
driver assistance system.<br /> <br /> Tesla said in the recall filing
that Autopilot’s software system controls “may not be sufficient to
prevent driver misuse” and could increase the risk of a crash.<br />
…<br /> Separately, since 2016, NHTSA has opened more than three dozen
Tesla special crash investigations in cases where driver systems such as
Autopilot were suspected of being used, with 23 crash deaths reported to
date.<br /> <br /> NHTSA said there might be an increased risk of a
crash in situations when the system is engaged but the driver does not
maintain responsibility for vehicle operation and is unprepared to
intervene or fails to recognize when it is canceled or not.
</blockquote>
The obfuscation is extraordinary — “forseeable misuse”, “may not be
sufficient” and “could increase”. There is no “foreseeable”, “may” nor
“could”; multiple people have already <i>died</i> because the system
<i>was</i> abused. When Tesla is sued about these deaths, their
<i>defense is that the system was abused</i>! I believe the system is
specifically <i>designed</i> to allow abuse, because preventing abuse
would puncture the hype bubble.<br /> <br /> Fortunately from the
NTHSA’s point of view the recall is pure kabuki, posing no risk from
Musk’s attack-dog lawyers and
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/buttigieg-defends-safety-agency-appointment-after-musk-claims-bias/">cult</a>
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/tesla-missy-cummings-nhtsa-elon-musk.html">members</a>
because the over-the-air update is cheap and doesn’t actually fix the
problem. The <i>Washington Post</i>’s headline writers didn’t understand
this whan they captioned the team’s timeline
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall-timeline/"><i>How
Tesla Autopilot got grounded</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Now, more than 2 million Tesla vehicles are
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/">receiving
a software update</a> to address “insufficient” controls to combat
driver inattention while in Autopilot mode. Here’s how the recall
unfolded, according to documents from Tesla, safety officials and
reporting by The Washington Post.
</blockquote>
The team did understand that Autopilot hadn’t been “grounded”. In
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/"><i>Recalling
almost every Tesla in America won’t fix safety issues, experts
say</i></a> they lay it out:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla this week agreed to issue a remote update to 2 million cars aimed
at improving driver attention while Autopilot is engaged, especially on
surface roads with cross traffic and other hazards the driver-assistance
technology is not designed to detect.<br /> <br /> But the recall — the
largest in Tesla’s 20-year history — quickly drew condemnation from
experts and lawmakers, who said new warnings and alerts are unlikely to
solve Autopilot’s fundamental flaw: that Tesla fails to limit where
drivers can turn it on in the first place.<br /> …<br /> Tesla has
repeatedly acknowledged in user manuals, legal documents and
communications with federal regulators that Autosteer is “intended for
use on controlled-access highways” with “a center divider, clear lane
markings, and no cross traffic.”
</blockquote>
The <i>Washington Post</i>’s Geoffrey A. Fowler checked on the result of
the kabuki, and wrote
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/31/tesla-autopilot-recall-test/"><i>Testing
Tesla’s Autopilot recall, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should
you</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Last weekend, my Tesla Model Y received an over-the-air update to make
its driver-assistance software safer. In my first test drive of the
updated Tesla, it blew through two stop signs without even slowing
down.<br /> <br /> In December, Tesla issued its largest-ever recall,
affecting almost all of its 2 million cars. It is like the software
updates you get on your phone, except this was supposed to prevent
drivers from misusing Tesla’s Autopilot software.<br /> <br /> After
testing my Tesla update, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should
you, knowing that this technology is on the same roads you use.<br />
<br /> During my drive, the updated Tesla steered itself on urban San
Francisco streets Autopilot wasn’t designed for. (I was careful to let
the tech do its thing only when my hands were hovering by the wheel and
I was paying attention.) The recall was supposed to force drivers to pay
more attention while using Autopilot by sensing hands on the steering
wheel and checking for eyes on the road. Yet my car drove through the
city with my hands off the wheel for stretches of a minute or more. I
could even activate Autopilot after I placed a sticker over the car’s
interior camera used to track my attention.
</blockquote>
Fowler concludes “I found we have every reason to be skeptical this
recall does much of anything”. Good job, Tesla!<br /> <br /> As a final
note Rishi Sunak, the UK’s tech-bro Prime Minister is naturally
determined to make the UK a leader in autonomous vehicles with his new
legislation on the subject. But, being a tech-bro, he has no idea of the
fundamental problem they pose. Wolmar does understand it,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport">writing</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the UK, Tesla will fall foul of the legislation introduced into
parliament last month, which prevents companies from misleading the
public about the capability of their vehicles. Tesla’s troubles have
been compounded by the revelations from ex-employee Lukasz Krupski who
claims the self-drive capabilities of Teslas
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67591311">pose a risk to
the public</a>. Manufacturers will be forced to specify precisely which
functions of the car – steering, brakes, acceleration – have been
automated. Tesla will have to change its marketing approach in order to
comply. So, while the bill has been promoted as enabling the more rapid
introduction of driverless cars, meeting its restrictive terms may prove
to be an insuperable obstacle for their developers.
</blockquote>
<p>Tesla’s stock market valuation <i>depends</i> upon “misleading the
public about the capability of their vehicles”.<br /> <br /></p>

Consumer credit jumped a whopping $23.7 billion in November, according
to the Federal Reserve. That continues a trend of households struggling
with high and rising prices, which is leading to a surge in debt and
delinquencies. And it’s putting additional strain on families,
especially lower-income ones. We’ll also preview what the December CPI

talking about a competitor’s product. A hairball is something a cat
coughs up. Very undesirable. Of course, given enough time all software
becomes a hairball. As you refine your understanding of how the product
is being used, versus how you thought it would be used, all the new
paths through the code and UI become more crooked and impenetrable by a
human mind, because you still have to do all the things you did before,
unless you start over. There often is value in starting over. Now is a
good time to be thinking about bare-bones social web apps. People are
open to new ideas.</p>

Wikipedia and journalism get wrong? Journalism often uses Wikipedia as a

Yesterday the administration announced 67 new recipients of nearly $1
billion in grant funding to transition to low- and zero-emission school
buses. The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean School Bus
Program, which gets funding from Biden’s 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, has $5 billion to spend over five years on helping schools swap old
buses for cleaner ones. So far it has allocated about $2 billion across
652 school districts, and this new round of funding will buy more than
2,700 clean buses. Most of the grant recipients are located in
low-income, rural, and tribal communities,

published in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of

and interfere with cells and tissues inside the human body. Research on

insured. The tally includes the devastating earthquake in Turkey and
Syria, but the analysis also points to climate change as a main driver
of severe storms that plagued North America and Europe, resulting in
unprecedented losses. “The warming of the Earth that has been
accelerating for some years is intensifying the extreme weather in many
regions, leading to increasing loss potentials,” says Munich Re’s chief
climate scientist Ernst Rauch. He added: “Society and industry need to
adapt to the changing risks – otherwise loss burdens will inevitably
increase.” There’s a map that shows the most expensive natural
disasters. It is too big to feature in one go, so here it is split in

latest accident might not ground business</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Investigators are still looking into why a piece of a Boeing aircraft
blew off an Alaska Airlines flight over the weekend. It’s the latest
issue with 737 Max planes, including an aircraft grounding following two
crashes several years ago. Thing is, plane orders take years and there
are few manufacturing competitors — meaning Boeing may not lose much
businesses. And later: how Germany’s budget cuts helped spawn a major
protest by farmers.

<h2
id="video-of-73-year-old-boarded-up-inside-apartment-sparks-investigation">Video
of 73-Year-Old Boarded Up Inside Apartment Sparks Investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HARVEY, Ill. — Rudolph Williams says he was home in a Chicago suburb
when he realized the doors and windows to his courtyard-style apartment
had been boarded up with plywood, locking him inside.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know exactly what was going on,” the 73-year-old said
Monday in describing how he tried to open his blocked door. “What the
hell?”</p>
<p>His story — chronicled by his nephew on now-viral videos — has
generated a firestorm of criticism about rental conditions at the
dilapidated low-income apartment complex in Harvey, Illinois. People are
also debating who’s to blame; and Mayor Christopher Clark has promised
an investigation.</p>
<p>City officials, residents, property owners and the property
management company have conflicting accounts about what happened Friday
at the 30-unit complex roughly 48.28 kilometers 30 miles) south of
Chicago.</p>
<p>It started that afternoon when crews without any logos on their
clothing or vehicles started boarding up units. Residents say they
weren’t warned and that the workers ignored residents telling them
people were still inside. City officials say police were on site earlier
in the day and performed well-being checks, but not when units were set
to be boarded up. The property owners say the tenants claims about
residents being boarded inside are false, and the property managers say
the units were empty before they started boarding up units at the city’s
direction.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Genevieve Tyler, who said she was recently laid off from her meat
factory job, was home when she heard noises outside and ran for a second
door in her apartment looking to escape because she thought it was a
break-in. That’s when she said she came upon crews boarding up her
windows.</p>
<p>“I feel sick,” she said, adding that she was too scared to return
home for two days. “I’m still sad.”</p>
<p>The complex, which is in clear disrepair, has been on the city’s
radar for months.</p>
<p>One of the two buildings has no heat, with residents using stoves and
space heaters to keep warm. A set of stairs has collapsed and is blocked
to pedestrians. There is garbage everywhere: broken furniture, a large
dumbbell and liquor bottles.</p>
<p>There have also been numerous safety issues involving drugs and
crime. Police were called to the property more than 300 times last year,
according to Harvey Police Chief Cameron Biddings.</p>
<p>City officials say the property owners, identified by the city as Jay
Patel and Henry Cho, were warned about the unsafe conditions and urged
to make changes. The owners were then notified that people had to
evacuate by Oct. 28 and had to let residents know.</p>
<p>However, only some residents say they got the message. Others who
were notified say they were skeptical of the documents’ legitimacy. Some
got letters on official city letterhead saying they had to leave due to
the safety risk, while others received papers from the property managers
that said the building would be shut down.</p>
<p>James Williams, Rudolph’s nephew, who lives with him at the property,
said a bunch of notices were strewn around the courtyard.</p>
<p>He and other people on site helped free his uncle from the apartment
Friday evening, partly by using a drill, he said.</p>
<p>In a joint statement emailed late Monday, the property owners
dismissed the residents’ “viral allegations.” The owners said they tried
to negotiate more time with the city for renters to stay and aimed to
have required repairs finished by March for the building to reopen.</p>
<p>The owners hired property management company, Chicago Style
Management, in November.</p>
<p>Tim Harstead with Chicago Style Management disputed Williams’
account, saying crews found one unauthorized person who left before they
started boarding up units.</p>
<p>“A lot of people in that area are squatters and trying to stay
there,” he said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mayor Clark and other city officials toured the complex,
which lies off a busy street in the community of 20,000.</p>
<p>In a series of interviews, Clark reluctantly acknowledged that people
were still inside their units when the apartments started being
shuttered, but he said he wanted to hear directly from residents rather
than via social media videos.</p>
<p>The city played no role in boarding up the apartments, he said,
pledging that city police would investigate and might turn the matter
over to the state’s attorney or Illinois attorney general. Criticism of
the city on social media was misdirected, he said.</p>
<p>“It’s horrible,” Clark said. “What’s even more horrible is the fact
that they would attribute that to people who are trying to actually help
the situation versus the people who actually put them in this
situation.”</p>
<p>At least one city official, Alderman Tyrone Rogers, told media
outlets over the weekend that residents’ claims were a “total
exaggeration.” He did not return messages Monday from The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Some residents, including 34-year-old Loren Johnson, left last month.
He said the shutdown notice scared him off as did the broken heating and
criminal activity.</p>
<p>“They don’t do anything, but they take full rent,” he said of the
landlords.</p>
<p>Roughly half a dozen residents remained on Monday, saying they look
out for each other.</p>
<p>Mary Brooks, 66, lives in one of the few apartments that wasn’t
boarded up.</p>
<p>She described herself as a cancer survivor with mental health issues
who has nowhere else to go. She also said she has tried to reach city
officials multiple times about the complex over her nearly four years of
living there, a complaint she shared with the mayor when he visited her
at home Monday.</p>
<p>“Nobody pays attention to the poor,” she said. “Nobody cares until
something happens.”</p>

<h2 id="us-man-held-in-moscow-on-drug-charges">US Man Held in Moscow on
Drug Charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — Russia has detained and brought drug-related charges against
U.S. citizen Robert Woodland, who was apprehended by law enforcement
earlier this month, a Moscow court said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Moscow is holding several American nationals on espionage and other
charges, as tensions between Russia and the United States balloon over
the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“On January 6, the Ostankinsky District Court of Moscow ordered
Robert Romanov Woodland to be placed in detention for a period of two
months, until March 5, 2024,” the court said on social media.</p>
<p>He is accused of the “illegal acquisition, storage, transportation,
manufacture, processing” of drugs and faces up to 20 years in
prison.</p>
<p>Russian authorities have arrested several U.S. citizens in recent
years, with critics accusing Moscow of using detainees as bargaining
chips to exchange Russians jailed in the United States.</p>
<p>Paul Whelan, an ex-US marine was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in
jail on spying charges that he denies.</p>
<p>In late March 2023, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich
became the first Western journalist to be held on espionage charges in
Russia since the Soviet era.</p>
<p>US-Russian dual citizen, journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, was arrested in
October. She has been charged with failing to register as a “foreign
agent” and spreading misinformation.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Russia released basketball superstar Brittney
Griner in exchange for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout — known
as the “Merchant of Death” — who had been jailed in the United
States.</p>

Urges Israel to Avoid Further Harming Civilians in Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv Tuesday to ensure his
country’s military avoids inflicting further harm on civilians in Gaza
in its ongoing war against Hamas militants.</p>
<p>“The Secretary reaffirmed our support for Israel’s right to prevent
the terrorist attacks of October 7 from being repeated and stressed the
importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian
infrastructure in Gaza,” State Department spokesman Mathew Miller said
in a statement Tuesday after Blinken met with Netanyahu and Israel’s war
cabinet.</p>
<p>Earlier, speaking alongside Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Blinken
said he would have the opportunity to meet with the families of the some
of the hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza, and to relay to Israeli
leaders some of what he heard from other leaders in the region during
stops in Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and
Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Herzog thanked the United States for “standing steadfast with Israel”
and said the war against Hamas is one that “affects international values
and the values of the free world.”</p>
<p>Herzog also rejected a lawsuit filed at the International Court of
Justice accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,
calling the accusation “atrocious and preposterous.”</p>
<p>Hearings in the case are due to begin Thursday, and Herzog said
Israel will “present proudly our case of using self-defense under our
most inherent right under international humanitarian law.”</p>
<p>Gaza health officials say close to 23,000 Palestinians, a large
percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel’s
military offensive in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Israel has criticized Hamas for locating its operations in civilian
areas, including the use of tunnels under cities.  Herzog said Tuesday
that Israel is “doing our utmost under extremely complicated
circumstances” to ensure there are no civilian casualties.</p>
<p>Blinken said Monday that leaders in the Middle East are determined to
prevent the Gaza conflict from spreading and that there is broad
recognition on the need to “chart a political path forward for the
Palestinians.”</p>
<p>“The West Bank and Gaza should be united under Palestinian-led
governance,” Blinken told reporters in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>“The future of the region needs to be one of integration, not
division and not conflict,” Blinken said, adding “for that to happen, we
need to see the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.”</p>
<p>In a statement following talks with Blinken, Saudi Arabian Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman underscored the importance of halting
military operations in the Gaza Strip and the need to create conditions
for restoring peace and stability.</p>
<p>When asked about the U.S.-led talks to normalize the relationship
between Saudi Arabia and Israel, Blinken said there is “a clear
interest” in Saudi Arabia, as well as in the region, in pursuing that
goal but “it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will
also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian
state.”</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has paused diplomatic talks to normalize ties with
Israel amid the military conflict between Hamas militants and Israeli
forces.</p>
<p>After an Israeli airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander in
southern Lebanon on Monday — the latest sign of a possibly widening
conflict in the Middle East — Blinken told reporters it is clearly not
in the interest of Israel, Lebanon, or Hezbollah to see an escalation
outside Gaza and “the Israelis have been very clear with” the U.S. that
“they want to find a diplomatic way forward.”</p>
<p>Hezbollah has identified the commander as Wissam al-Tawil. Last week,
senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike in
Beirut. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant
allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range
attacks against Israel.</p>
<p>The United States has urged Israel to shift to smaller scale military
operations in Gaza but has continued to support Israel in refusing Arab
demands for a cease-fire to halt the fighting in the three-month war.
Israel has vowed to continue the war until it believes the threat of
future Hamas attacks has been eradicated and the militant group no
longer controls Gaza, a narrow strip of territory along the
Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas
fighters crossed into southern Israel on October 7. Israel said about
1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror
attack.</p>
<p>Some material for this report was provided by Reuters and The
Associated Press.</p>

Narrowly Avoided Disaster as Jet’s Wall Rips Away at 3 Miles High</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — The loud “boom” was startling enough, and the
roaring wind that immediately filled the airline cabin left Kelly
Bartlett unnerved. Still, it wasn’t until a shaken teenager, shirtless
and scratched, slid into the seat next to her that she realized just how
close disaster had come.</p>
<p>A section of the Boeing 737 Max 9’s fuselage just three rows away had
blown out — at 4.8 kilometers (3 miles ) high — creating a vacuum that
twisted the metal of the seats nearby, and snatched cellphones, headsets
and even the shirt off the teenager’s back.</p>
<p>“We knew something was wrong,” Bartlett told The Associated Press on
Monday. “We didn’t know what. We didn’t know how serious. We didn’t know
if it meant we were going to crash.”</p>
<p>The first six minutes of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland to
Southern California’s Ontario International Airport on Friday had been
routine, the Boeing 737 Max 9 about halfway to its cruising altitude and
traveling at more than 640 kph (400 mph).</p>
<p>Flight attendants had just told the 171 passengers that they could
resume using electronic devices — in airplane mode, of course — when it
happened.</p>
<p>Then suddenly a 61-centimeter-by-122-centimeter (2-foot-by-4-foot)
piece of fuselage covering an unoperational emergency exit behind the
left wing blew out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, and
as fate would have it, these included the two seats closest to the
blown-out hole.</p>
<p>The oxygen masks dropped immediately, and Bartlett saw a flight
attendant walking down the aisle toward the affected row, leaning
forward as if facing a stiff wind. Then flight attendants began moving
passengers from the area where the blowout occurred and helped them move
away.</p>
<p>Among them was the teenage boy moved next to Bartlett.</p>
<p>“His shirt got sucked off of his body when the panel blew out because
of the pressure, and it was his seatbelt that kept him in his seat and
saved his life. And there he was next to me,” she said, adding that his
mother was reseated elsewhere.</p>
<p>“We had our masks on, and the plane was really loud so we couldn’t
talk. But I had a … notes app on my phone that I was typing on. So I
typed to him and I asked him if he was hurt,” Bartlett said. “I just
couldn’t believe he was sitting there and what he must have gone
through, what he must have been feeling at the time.”</p>
<p>She said the boy typed back that he was OK, but a bit scratched,
adding “that was unbelievable” and “thank you for your kindness.”</p>
<p>The exit door plug landed in the southwest Portland backyard of high
school physics teacher Bob Sauer. Sauer said his heart “did start
beating a little faster” when he saw it in the beam of his flashlight
Sunday night as he searched for any debris.</p>
<p>“It was very obviously part of a plane,” he told a group of reporters
outside his home on Monday. “I thought, ‘Oh my goodness, people have
been looking for this all weekend and it looks like it’s in my
backyard.’”</p>
<p>Sauer said he and the seven National Transportation Safety Board
agents who came to his home to pick up the door plug were amazed it was
intact. It appeared that tree branches had broken its fall.</p>
<p>A headrest landed on the patio of Sauer’s neighbor, Diane Flaherty.
Flaherty didn’t realize what the charcoal-colored cushion was until a
friend emailed her to say federal agents were looking for airplane parts
in her neighborhood. An NTSB agent came by to pick it up.</p>
<p>“What are the chances that a headrest cushion falls out of the sky
into your backyard?” she said.</p>
<p>The pilots and flight attendants have not made public statements and
their names have not been released, but in interviews with National
Transportation Safety Board investigators they described how their
training kicked in. The pilots focused on getting the plane quickly back
to Portland and the flight attendants on keeping the passengers safe and
as calm as possible.</p>
<p>“The actions of the flight crew were really incredible,” NTSB Chair
Jennifer Homendy said at a Sunday night news conference. She described
the scene inside the cabin during those first seconds as “chaos, very
loud between the air and everything going on around them and it was very
violent.”</p>
<p>Bartlett echoed praise for the crew, saying the entire time she felt
like the plane was under control even though the roaring wind was so
loud she couldn’t hear the captain’s announcements.</p>
<p>“The flight attendants really responded well to the situation. They
got everyone safe and then they got themselves safe,” she said. “And
then there was nothing to do but wait, right? We were just on our way
down and it was just a normal descent. It felt normal.”</p>
<p>Inside the cockpit, the pilot and co-pilot donned their oxygen masks
and opened their microphone, but “communication was a serious issue”
between them and the flight attendants because of the noise, Homendy
said. The pilots retrieved an emergency handbook kept secure next to the
captain’s seat.</p>
<p>The co-pilot contacted air traffic controllers, declaring an
emergency and saying the plane needed to immediately descend to 3,048
meters, (10,000 feet) the altitude where there is enough oxygen for
everyone onboard to breathe.</p>
<p>“We need to turn back to Portland,” she said in a calm voice that she
maintained throughout the landing.</p>
<p>In the cabin, the flight attendants’ immediate focus was on the five
unaccompanied minors in their care and the three infants being carried
on their parents’ laps.</p>
<p>“Were they safe? Were they secure? Did they have their seat belts on
or their lap belts on? And did they have their masks on? And they did,”
Homendy said.</p>
<p>Some passengers began sending messages on social media to loved ones.
One young woman said on TikTok that she was certain the plane would
nosedive at any second and she wondered how her death would affect her
mother, worrying that she would never recover from the sorrow.</p>
<p>But she and others said the cabin remained surprisingly calm. One
passenger, Evan Granger, who was sitting in front of the blowout, told
NBC News that his “focus in that moment was just breathe into the oxygen
mask and trust that the flight crew will do everything they can to keep
us safe.”</p>
<p>“There were so many things that had to go right in order for all of
us to survive,” Granger said.</p>
<p>Video taken by those on board showed flight attendants moving down
the aisle checking on passengers. Through the hole, city lights could be
seen flickering past.</p>
<p>Evan Smith, an attorney traveling on the plane, told reporters the
descent and landing were loud but smooth. When the plane touched down at
Portland International about 20 minutes after it departed, the
passengers broke into applause. Firefighters came down the aisle to
check for injuries, but no one was seriously hurt.</p>
<p>Homendy said that if the blowout had happened a few minutes later,
after the plane reached cruising altitude, the accident might have
become a tragedy.</p>
<p>Bartlett’s mind also keeps returning to the what-ifs.</p>
<p>“I’m glad that it is not any worse than it was — that’s all. I keep
coming back to it,” she said. “Like, how lucky Jack got. That was his
name, the kid who sat next to me. His name was Jack, and how lucky he
was that he had a seatbelt on.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, a passenger’s cellphone that had been sucked out of the
plane was found. It was still operational, having survived its plunge
from the sky.</p>
<p>It was open to the owner’s baggage claim receipt.</p>

Describes White Supremacy as ‘Poison’ in Pitch to Black Voters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden made a heartfelt appeal to Black
voters on Monday, speaking passionately at a storied South Carolina
church scarred by racially motivated tragedy and seeking support as
members of the state’s large Black community head to the nation’s first
Democratic primary next month.</p>
<p>Before a packed congregation at Charleston’s Mother Emanuel African
Methodist Episcopal Church, Biden spoke of “a poison that’s for too long
haunted this nation,” echoing words from former President Donald Trump,
who has made waves on the campaign trail by accusing immigrants of
“poisoning the blood” of the nation.</p>
<p>“What is that poison?” Biden continued. “White supremacy. …
Throughout our history, it’s ripped this nation apart. This has no place
in America. Not today, tomorrow or ever.”</p>
<p>With those words, Biden became the first sitting American president
to speak from the pulpit of one of the nation’s oldest and most
respected Black spiritual institutions. The stately church, founded more
than two centuries ago, was the scene of a gruesome mass shooting in
2015 in which nine people, including the church’s pastor, were killed by
a white supremacist.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy at the Reverend Clementa
Pinckney’s funeral in 2015, which was held in TD Arena at the College of
Charleston.</p>
<p>The tragedy prompted South Carolina’s governor at the time, Nikki
Haley — who is now running for the Republican presidential nomination —
to remove the Confederate flag that flew over the state Capitol.</p>
<p>Biden also capitalized on the venue by indirectly mentioning Haley’s
reluctance in a recent public forum to acknowledge that disagreements
over slavery caused the Civil War.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear for those who don’t seem to know: Slavery was the
cause of the Civil War,” he said, to applause. “There is no negotiation
about that.”</p>
<p>Racism an election issue</p>
<p>Groups that work to mobilize overlooked voters say racism is a top
issue that emerges time and again in polls and focus groups.</p>
<p>Cynthia Wallace co-founded the New Rural Project after her
unsuccessful congressional run in 2020 showed that 60,000 registered
voters of color in her North Carolina district didn’t turn up at the
polls.</p>
<p>“When we look at the top issues that concern folks, and we look at it
by demographics, African American infrequent voters — these are part of
those 60,000 folks who didn’t show up, who we are actually specifically
targeted to speak to — one of their top issues, whether it’s from the
polling or the focus groups, is racism,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>But, she added, “We continue to hear most of the rural folks that we
speak to focus on the kitchen-table issues.”</p>
<p>South Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn hit some of those points in
introducing Biden, listing what he saw as Biden’s achievements and
contrasting him with Trump.</p>
<p>Clyburn outlined Biden’s attempts at student loan forgiveness, his
appointment of an unprecedented number of Black female judges, his
support of abortion rights, his work to reduce health care costs and his
efforts to help veterans.</p>
<p>“We know Joe,” he said. “But most importantly, Joe knows us
well.”</p>
<p>“I rest my case,” Biden quipped after Clyburn’s speech, as attendees
chanted “Four more years!” in support of Biden’s reelection.</p>
<p>But Clyburn’s rousing words contrasted with his weekend comments on
CNN, where he said he was “very concerned” about the Biden campaign’s
ability to “break through that MAGA wall” — a reference to Trump’s Make
America Great Again motto — and communicate his message to voters.</p>
<p>Polls show that Biden faces challenges with Black voters, who
propelled him to victory over Trump in 2020. A poll conducted late last
year by the GenForward Survey project found that 17% of Black voters
said they would vote for Trump, and 20% would vote for “someone else.”
Sixty-three percent said they would vote for Biden.</p>
<p>‘Cease-fire now’ or ‘four more years’?</p>
<p>Some of the disagreements appeared in real-time on Monday, when a
heckler, referring to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, led a chant of
“cease-fire now” — which was then drowned out by louder chants of “four
more years.”</p>
<p>Biden acknowledged the hecklers, saying, “I understand their
passion.”</p>
<p>He added, “I’ve been quietly working with the Israeli government to
get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza. I’ve been using
all that I can to do that.”</p>
<p>Democratic strategist Douglas Wilson, speaking to VOA from North
Carolina, said the Black community is divided on perceptions of the war
in Gaza, with younger voters viewing “Palestinians as being people of
color and look at the end of the Israelis as occupiers or as
colonizers.”</p>
<p>“That’s a course that’s up for debate,” he added. “I don’t agree with
that personally. But there is a segment of the community that feels that
way.”</p>
<p>Misinformation and the economy</p>
<p>Wallace, of the New Rural Project, noted the role of misinformation
in skewing attitudes. She said that only one Black voter she spoke to
raised the issue of Gaza and falsely claimed that Biden supports Hamas,
the militant group that launched the stunning attack on Israel on
Oct. 7.</p>
<p>Biden has repeatedly called Hamas “terrorists,” described their acts
as “evil” and has given material and moral support to Israel. Hamas is a
U.S.-designated terrorist group.</p>
<p>“I think in this information-heavy world, I think it’s hard for
information to cut through,” Wallace said. “You’ve got to make sure that
people actually know what things you’ve done and what things you plan to
do more of and what things you’re fighting for.”</p>
<p>Wilson added that more details on Black economic empowerment could
also shift voter support.</p>
<p>“I would have liked to hear him give a brief outline of what his
economic agenda will be in a second term for Black America,” he said.
“And I think that if he can begin to articulate that, then it will give
Black voters a reason to come out and vote for him in high numbers.”</p>
<p>South Carolina voters participate in the Democratic presidential
primary on Feb. 3, in which Representative Dean Phillips and author and
self-professed spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson are also on the
ballot.</p>

Middle East Leaders Determined to Prevent Wider War</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday
leaders in the Middle East are determined to prevent the Gaza conflict
from spreading and that there is broad recognition on the need to “chart
a political path forward for the Palestinians.” </p>
<p>“The West Bank and Gaza should be united under Palestinian-led
governance,” Blinken told reporters at Al Ula airport in Saudi
Arabia. </p>
<p>“The future of the region needs to be one of integration, not
division and not conflict,” said Blinken, adding “for that to happen, we
need to see the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.” </p>
<p>In a statement following talks with Blinken, Saudi Arabian Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman underscored the importance of halting
military operations in the Gaza Strip and the need to create conditions
for restoring peace and stability. Local media have reported that this
effort aims to ensure the Palestinian people obtain their legitimate
rights and achieve a just and lasting peace. </p>
<p>On Monday, Blinken met with the United Arab Emirates President Sheikh
Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and senior officials from Saudi Arabia
before heading to Israel. </p>
<p>The chief U.S. diplomat said he would push Israeli officials for more
humanitarian aid to Gaza and more protection for civilians. He also
plans to discuss efforts to secure the release of the remaining hostages
and how to ensure the conflict does not spread to other parts of the
region.   </p>
<p>When asked about the U.S.-led talks to normalize the relationship
between Saudi Arabia and Israel, Blinken stated that there is “a clear
interest” in Saudi Arabia, as well as in the region, in pursuing that
goal but “it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will
also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian
state.” </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has paused diplomatic talks to normalize ties with
Israel amid the military conflict between Hamas militants and Israeli
forces. </p>
<p>After an Israeli airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander in
southern Lebanon on Monday — the latest sign of a possibly widening
conflict in the Middle East — Blinken told reporters it’s clearly not in
the interest of Israel, Lebanon, or Hezbollah to see an escalation
outside Gaza and “the Israelis have been very clear with” the U.S. that
“they want to find a diplomatic way forward.” </p>
<p>Hezbollah has identified the commander as Wissam al-Tawil. Last week,
senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike in
Beirut. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant
allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range
attacks against Israel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In meetings Sunday with Jordan King Abdullah II and Qatari Emir
Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the top U.S. diplomat spoke of the need
for Israel to curb civilian casualties during the Israeli-Hamas war in
Gaza and significantly increase the amount of humanitarian aid reaching
famished Palestinians in Gaza. </p>
<p>But the U.S. has continued to support Israel in refusing Arab demands
for a cease-fire to halt the fighting in the three-month war. Israel has
vowed to continue the war until it believes the threat of future Hamas
attacks has been eradicated and the militant group no longer controls
Gaza, a narrow strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea. </p>
<p>Jordan’s royal court said King Abdullah “warned of the catastrophic
repercussions” of Israel’s war in Gaza against Hamas while calling on
the U.S. to press for an immediate cease-fire. Israeli and U.S.
officials have said they believe that a cease-fire would only allow
Hamas to be able to regroup in its fight against Israeli forces. </p>
<p>While in Amman, Blinken also visited a World Food Program warehouse
where trucks are loaded with aid for famished Palestinians in Gaza. </p>
<p>“The efforts right here to collect and distribute food to people in
need are absolutely essential,” Blinken said. “The United States has
worked from day one to open access routes into Gaza.” </p>
<p>“We continue to work on that every single day, not only to open them
but to multiply them, to maximize them and to try to get more
assistance, more effectively,” he said. “We’re determined to do
everything we possibly can to ameliorate the situation for the men,
women and children in Gaza.”</p>
<p>Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas
fighters crossed into southern Israel on October 7. Israel said about
1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror
attack.</p>
<p>Gaza health officials say close to 23,000 Palestinians, a large
percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel’s
military offensive in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The United States has stated its opposition to forcibly removing
Palestinians from Gaza. The U.S. is also working on a postwar road map
for the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>“Gaza cannot, once again, serve as a launching pad for terrorist
attacks against Israel,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller
told VOA last week.</p>
<p>“What we ultimately want to see is Gaza and the West Bank reunited
under Palestinian leadership,” and “certainly there’s no role for Hamas
in that.”</p>

Associated Press.</p>

id="msnbcs-mehdi-hasan-quits-rather-than-accept-demotion-at-news-network">MSNBC’s
Mehdi Hasan Quits Rather Than Accept Demotion at News Network</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New york — Prominent Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan has decided to
quit MSNBC rather than accept a demotion that saw him lose a regular
Sunday night program on the network.</p>
<p>Hasan announced at the end of Sunday show that “I’ve decided to look
for a new challenge. This is not just my final episode of ‘The Mehdi
Hasan Show,’ it’s my last day at MSNBC.”</p>
<p>The network had announced in November that Hasan would lose his
weekly show after three years but would remain as an analyst and fill-in
anchor.</p>
<p>That decision, with no public explanation, launched a fruitless
petition campaign in protest by the Progressive Change Campaign
Committee. U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar called it “deeply troubling
that MSNBC is canceling his show amid a rampant rise of anti-Muslim
bigotry and suppression of Muslim voices.”</p>
<p>An MSNBC spokeswoman said Monday the network had no comment on
Hasan’s exit.</p>
<p>His final show featured an interview with Motaz Azaiza, a Palestinian
photographer who talked about the danger of working in Gaza during
Israeli military operations.</p>
<p>Hasan on Monday also forwarded a report on X, formerly Twitter, about
Palestinian children losing limbs, adding the message, “Read this
sentence. Then reread it. Then ask yourself how anyone is OK with this
level of human suffering.”</p>
<p>Hasan told viewers that he’s proud of what had been achieved on his
show.</p>
<p>“As I say: new year, new plans,” he said.</p>
<p>Hasan, who previously worked at Al Jazeera English and the Intercept,
offered no details and declined further comment on Monday.</p>
<p>To replace Hasan, MSNBC is increasing the weekend hours of Ayman
Mohyeldin, another Muslim journalist.</p>

Molly McGhee’s “Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind” (08 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Molly McGhee’s “Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind”: A
haunting novel of debt, work, dreams, and the capitalist nightmare. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009,
2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Molly McGhee’s
“Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind” (permalink) Jonathan Abernathy You Are
Kind is Molly McGhee’s debut novel: a dreamlike tale of a public-private
partnership that hires the terminally endebted to invade the dreams of
white-collar professionals and harvest the anxieties that prevent them
from being fully productive members of the American corporate workforce:
https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/734829/jonathan-abernathy-you-are-kind-by-molly-mcghee/
Though this is McGhee’s first novel, she’s already well known in
literary circles. Her career has included stints at McSweeney’s, where
she worked on my book Information Doesn’t Want To Be Free:
https://store.mcsweeneys.net/products/information-doesn-t-want-to-be-free
And then at Tor Books, where she worked on my book Attack Surface:
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757531/attacksurface But though
McGhee is a shrewd and skilled editor, I think of her first and foremost
as a writer, thanks to stunning essays like “America’s Dead Souls,” a
2021 Paris Review piece that described the experience of
multigenerational debt in America in incandescent, pitiless prose:
https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2021/05/17/americas-dead-souls/
McGhee’s piece struck at the heart of something profoundly wrong in
American society – the dual nature of debt, which represents a source of
freedom for the wealthy, and bondage for workers:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation When
billionaire mass-murderers like the Sacklers amass tens of billions of
liabilities stemming from their role in deliberately starting the opioid
crisis, the courts step in to relieve them of their obligations,
allowing them to keep their blood-money:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/11/justice-delayed/#justice-redeemed And
when Silicon Valley Bank collapses due to mismanagement by ultra-wealthy
financiers, the public purse yawns open and billions flow out to ensure
that the wealthiest investors in the country stay whole:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich
When predatory payday lenders target working people and force them into
bankruptcy with four-digit APRs, the government intervenes…to save the
lenders and keep workers on the hook:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/29/planned-obsolescence/#academic-fraud
“Debtor vs creditor” is the oldest class division we have. The Bronze
Age custom of jubilee – the periodic cancellation of all debts – wasn’t
some weird peccadillo. It was essential public policy, and without
jubilee, the hereditary creditor class became the arbiter of all social
priorities, destabilizing great nations and even empires by directing
production to suit their parochial needs. Societies that didn’t practice
jubilee (or halted it) collapsed:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/08/jubilant/#construire-des-passerelles
Today’s workers are debt burdened at scales and in ways that defy
comprehension, the numbers are so brain-breakingly large. Students who
take out modest loans and pay them off several times over remain
indebted decades later, with outstanding balances that vastly outstrip
the principle:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/04/kawaski-trawick/#strike-debt Workers
who quit dead-end jobs are billed for five-figure “training repayment”
bills that haunt them to the end of days:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose
Hospitals sue indigent patients at scale, siccing debt-collectors on
people who can’t pay – and were entitled to free care to begin with:
https://armandalegshow.com/episode/when-hospitals-sue-patients-part-2/
And debt collectors are drawn from the same social ranks as the debtors,
barely trained and unsupervised, engaging in lawless, constant
harassment of the debtor class:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/12/do-not-pay/#fair-debt-collection-practices-act
McGhee’s “American Dead Souls” crystallized all of this vast injustice
into a single, beautiful essay – and then McGhee crystallized things
further by posting a public resignation letter enumerating the poor pay
and working conditions in New York publishing, triggering mass,
industry-wide resignations by similarly situated junior editorial staff:
https://electricliterature.com/molly-mcghee-jonathan-abernathy-you-are-kind-interview-debut-novel-book-debt/
Thus we arrive at McGhee’s debut: a novel written by someone with a
track record for gorgeous, brutally insightful prose; incisive analysis
of the class war raging in the embers of capitalism’s American Dream;
and consequential labor organizing against the precarity and
exploitation of young workers. As you might expect, it’s fantastic.
Jonathan Abernathy is a 25 year old, debt haunted, desperately lonely
man. An orphan with a mountain of college debt, Abernathy lives in a
terrible basement apartment whose rent is just beyond his means. The
only thing that propels him out of bed and into the world are his
affirmations: Jonathan Abernathy you are kind You are well respected and
valued by your community People, including your family, love you That
these are all easily discerned lies is beside the point. Whatever gets
you through the night. We meet Jonathan as he is applying for a job that
he was recruited for in a dream. As instructed in his dream, he presents
himself at a shabby strip-mall office where an acerbic functionary
behind scratched plexiglass takes his application and informs him that
he is up for a gig run jointly by the US State Department and a
consortium of large corporate employers. If he is accepted, all of his
student debt repayments will be paused and he will no longer face wage
garnishment. What’s more, he’ll be doing the job in his sleep, which
means he’ll be able to get a day job and pull a double income – what’s
not to like? Jonathan’s job is to enter the dreams of sleeping
middle-management types in America’s largest firms – but not just any
dreams, their nightmares. Once he has entered their nightmare, Jonathan
is charged with identifying the source of their anxiety and summoning a
more senior operative who will suck up and whisk away that nagging
spectre, thus rendering the worker a more productive component of their
corporate structure. But of course, there’s more to it. As Jonathan
works through his sleeping hours, he is deprived of his own dreams. Then
there’s the question of where those captive anxieties are ending up, and
how they’re being processed, and what new products can be made from
refined nightmares. While Jonathan himself is pulling ever so slightly
out of his economic quagmire, the people around him are still
struggling. McGhee braids together three strands: the palpable misery of
being Jonathan (a proxy for all of us), the rising terror of the true
nature of his employment, and beautifully turned absurdist touches that
are laugh-aloud funny. This could be a mere novel of ennui and misery
but it’s not – it’s a novel of hilarity and fear and misery, all mixed
together in a glorious and terrible concoction that is not like anything
else you’ve ever read. Hey look at this (permalink) 2023 Word of the

<h2 id="influxdb-fdw-2.1.0-release">InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 released
</p>
<p>
We have just released version 2.1.0 of the Foreign Data Wrapper for
InfluxDB. This release can work with PostgreSQL 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
</p>
<p>
This release improves following item (from 2.0.0):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Support PostgreSQL 16.0
</li>
<li>
Bug fix: Cannot delete when time series column defined as timestamptz
type
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The FDW supports following features :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports pushed down some aggregate functions: count,
stddev, sum, max, min.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports INSERT, DELETE statements.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports bulk INSERT by using batch_size option from
PostgreSQL version 14 or later.
</li>
<li>
WHERE clauses including timestamp, interval and now() functions are
pushed down.
</li>
<li>
LIMIT…OFFSET clauses are pushed down when there is LIMIT clause only or
both LIMIT and OFFSET.
</li>
<li>
Support schemaless mode that allows access to elements in the data file
without changing the table definition by using jsonb typed column.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Limitations :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UPDATE is not supported.
</li>
<li>
WITH CHECK OPTION constraints is not supported. Following limitations
originate from data model and query language of InfluxDB.
</li>
<li>
Result sets have different number of rows depending on specified target
list. For example, SELECT field1 FROM t1 and SELECT field2 FROM t1
returns different number of rows if the number of points with field1 and
field2 are different in InfluxDB database.
</li>
<li>
Timestamp precision may be lost because timestamp resolution of
PostgreSQL is microseconds while that of InfluxDB is nanoseconds.
</li>
<li>
Conditions like WHERE time + interval ‘1 day’ &lt; now() do not work.
Please use WHERE time &lt; now() - interval ‘1 day’.
</li>
</ul>

Pneumonia are the leading cause of death worldwide, and antibiotic
treatment remains fundamental. However, conventional sputum smears or
cultures are still inefficient for obtaining pathogenic
microorganisms.Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has shown
great value in nucleic acid detection, however, the NGS results for
lower respiratory tract microorganisms are still poorly studied.

This study dealt with investigating the efficacy of mNGS in detecting
pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of patients with pulmonary
infections. A total of 112 patients admitted at the First Affiliated
Hospital of Zhengzhou University between April 30, 2018, and June 30,
2020, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from lower respiratory tract from each
patient. Routine methods (bacterial smear and culture) and mNGS were
employed for the identification of pathogenic microorganisms in BALF.

Results
</title>
<p>
The average patient age was 53.0 years, with 94.6% (106/112) obtaining
pathogenic microorganism results. The total mNGS detection rate of
pathogenic microorganisms significantly surpassed conventional methods
(93.7% vs. 32.1%, P &lt; 0.05). Notably, 75% of patients (84/112) were
found to have bacteria by mNGS, but only 28.6% (32/112) were found to
have bacteria by conventional approaches. The most commonly detected
bacteria included <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (19.6%),
<italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (17.9%), <italic>Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</italic> (14.3%), <italic>Staphylococcus faecium</italic>
(12.5%), <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> (12.5%), and
<italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> (11.6%). In 29.5% (33/112)
of patients, fungi were identified using mNGS, including 23 cases of
<italic>Candida albicans</italic> (20.5%), 18 of <italic>Pneumocystis
carinii</italic> (16.1%), and 10 of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (8.9%).
However, only 7.1 % (8/112) of individuals were found to have fungi when
conventional procedures were used. The mNGS detection rate of viruses
was significantly higher than the conventional method rate (43.8%
vs. 0.9%, P &lt; 0.05). The most commonly detected viruses included
Epstein–Barr virus (15.2%), cytomegalovirus (13.4%), circovirus (8.9%),
human coronavirus (4.5%), and rhinovirus (4.5%). Only 29.4% (33/112) of
patients were positive, whereas 5.4% (6/112) of patients were negative
for both detection methods as shown by Kappa analysis, indicating poor
consistency between the two methods (P = 0.340; Kappa analysis).
</p>

<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Significant benefits of mNGS have been shown in the detection of
pathogenic microorganisms in patients with pulmonary infection. For
those with suboptimal therapeutic responses, mNGS can provide an
etiological basis, aiding in precise anti-infective treatment.

modulating functions of probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum in
particulate matter-associated pulmonary inflammation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection

<p>
Pulmonary disease represents a substantial global health burden.
Increased air pollution, especially fine particulate matter
(PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is the most concerned proportion of air pollutants to
respiratory health. PM<sub>2.5</sub> may carry or combine with other
toxic allergens and heavy metals, resulting in serious respiratory
allergies and anaphylactic reactions in the host. Available treatment
options such as antihistamines, steroids, and avoiding
allergens/dust/pollutants could be limited due to certain side effects
and immense exposure to air pollutants, especially in most polluted
countries. In this mini-review, we summarized how PM<sub>2.5</sub>
triggers respiratory hyperresponsiveness and inflammation, and the
probiotic <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic> supplementation
could minimize the risk of the same. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> may
confer beneficial effects in PM<sub>2.5</sub>-associated pulmonary
inflammation due to significant antioxidant potential. We discussed
<italic>L. plantarum’s</italic> effect on PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced
reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines, lipid
peroxidation, and DNA damage. Available preclinical evidence shows
<italic>L. plantarum</italic> induces gut-lung axis, SCFA, GABA, and
other neurotransmitter signaling via gut microbiota modulation. SCFA
signals are important in maintaining lung homeostasis and regulating
intracellular defense mechanisms in alveolar cells. However, significant
research is needed in this direction to contemplate <italic>L.
plantarum</italic>’s therapeutic potential in pulmonary allergies.

receptors Optn and p62 and autophagy modulator Dram1 independently
promote the zebrafish host defense against Mycobacterium marinum</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Anti-bacterial autophagy, also known as xenophagy, is a crucial innate
immune process that helps maintain cellular homeostasis by targeting
invading microbes. This defense pathway is widely studied in the context
of infections with mycobacteria, the causative agents of human
tuberculosis and tuberculosis-like disease in animal models. Our
previous work in a zebrafish tuberculosis model showed that host defense
against <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (Mm) is impaired by
deficiencies in xenophagy receptors, optineurin (Optn) or sequestome 1
(p62), and Damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (Dram1). However, the
interdependency of these receptors and their interaction with Dram1
remained unknown. In the present study, we used single and double
knockout zebrafish lines in combination with overexpression experiments.
We show that Optn and p62 can compensate for the loss of each other’s
function, as their overexpression restores the infection susceptibility
of the mutant phenotypes. Similarly, Dram1 can compensate for
deficiencies in Optn and p62, and, vice versa, Optn and p62 compensate
for the loss of Dram1, indicating that these xenophagy receptors and
Dram1 do not rely on each other for host defense against Mm. In
agreement, Dram1 overexpression in <italic>optn/p62</italic> double
mutants restored the interaction of autophagosome marker Lc3 with Mm.
Finally, <italic>optn/p62</italic> double mutants displayed more severe
infection susceptibility than the single mutants. Taken together, these
results suggest that Optn and p62 do not function downstream of each
other in the anti-mycobacterial xenophagy pathway, and that the
Dram1-mediated defense against Mm infection does not rely on specific
xenophagy receptors.

the invading extracellular and intracellular FnBp+ bacteria from
respiratory epithelial cells by autophagy mediated through
FnBp-Fn-Integrin α5β1 axis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
We previously found that the respiratory epithelial cells could
eliminate the invaded <italic>group A streptococcus</italic> (GAS)
through autophagy induced by binding a fibronectin (Fn) binding protein
(FnBp) expressed on the surface of GAS to plasma protein Fn and its
receptor integrin α5β1 of epithelial cells. Is autophagy initiated by
FnBp<sup>+</sup> bacteria via FnBp-Fn-Integrin α5β1 axis a common event
in respiratory epithelial cells?
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We chose <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus/S.
a</italic>) and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>L.
monocytogenes/L. m</italic>) as representatives of extracellular and
intracellular FnBp<sup>+</sup> bacteria, respectively. The FnBp of them
was purified and the protein function was confirmed by western blot,
viable bacteria count, confocal and pull-down. The key molecule
downstream of the action axis was detected by IP, mass spectrometry and
bio-informatics analysis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
We found that different FnBp from both <italic>S. aureus</italic> and
<italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> could initiate autophagy through
FnBp-Fn-integrin α5β1 axis and this could be considered a universal
event, by which host tries to remove invading bacteria from epithelial
cells. Importantly, we firstly reported that S100A8, as a key molecule
downstream of integrin β1 chain, is highly expressed upon activation of
integrin α5β1, which in turn up-regulates autophagy.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Various FnBp from FnBp<sup>+</sup> bacteria have the ability to initiate
autophagy via FnBp-Fn-Integrin α5β1 axis to promote the removal of
invading bacteria from epithelial cells in the presence of fewer
invaders. S100A8 is a key molecule downstream of Integrin α5β1 in this
autophagy pathway.

Lately, the bacterial multidrug resistance has been a reason to public
health concerning around world. The development of new pharmacology
therapies against infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria is
urgent. In this work, we developed 10 NLC formulations composed of
essential oils (EO), vegetable butter and surfactant. The formulations
were evaluated for long-term and thermal cycling stability studies in
terms of (particle size, polydispersion index and Zeta potential).
<italic>In vitro</italic> antimicrobial assays were performed using disk
diffusion test and by the determination of the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) performed with fresh and a year-old NLC. The most
promising system and its excipients were structurally characterized
through experimental methodologies (FTIR-ATR, DSC and FE-SEM). Finally,
this same formulation was studied through nanotoxicity assays on the
chicken embryo model, analyzing different parameters, as viability and
weight changes of embryos and annexes. All the developed formulations
presented long-term physicochemical and thermal stability. The
formulation based on cinnamon EO presented <italic>in vitro</italic>

reactive immunomes of Ehrlichia chaffeensis and E. canis are diverse and

<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
For decades, the defined antibody reactive proteins of <italic>Ehrlichia
chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E. canis</italic> were limited to a
small group with linear antibody epitopes. Recently, our laboratory has
utilized an immunomics-based approach to rapidly screen and identify
undefined <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E.
canis</italic> antigenic proteins and antibody epitopes. In this study,
we analyzed the remaining portion (~50%) of the <italic>E.
chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E. canis</italic> proteomes
(<italic>n</italic> = 444 and <italic>n =</italic> 405 proteins,
respectively), that were not examined in previous studies, to define the
complete immunomes of these important pathogens. Almost half of the
<italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> proteins screened (196/444) reacted with
antibodies in convalescent HME patient sera, while only 43 <italic>E.
canis</italic> proteins reacted with CME dog sera. New major
immunoreactive proteins were identified in <italic>E.
chaffeensis</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and <italic>E.
canis</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 1), increasing the total number of
<italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> (n = 14) and <italic>E. canis</italic>
proteins (n = 18) that exhibited antibody reactivity comparable to
well-defined major antigenic proteins (TRP120 and TRP19). All of the
<italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> but only some <italic>E. canis</italic>
major immunoreactive proteins contained major conformation-dependent
antibody epitopes. The <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> immunoreactive
proteins were generally small (&lt; 250 amino acids; ~27kDa) and the
<italic>E. canis</italic> proteins were slightly larger (&gt; 320 amino
acids; ~35 kDa). The majority of these new <italic>Ehrlichia</italic>
major immunoreactive proteins were predicted to be type I secreted
effectors, some of which contained transmembrane domains.
Characterization of the immunomes of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> and
<italic>E. canis</italic> and understanding the host specific
<italic>Ehrlichia</italic> immune responses will facilitate
identification of protective antigens and define the biophysical epitope

<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Research into the effects of <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic>
pneumonia on the liver has emerged in the last few years. However, no
studies have systematically described liver injury in patients with
psittacosis. We present the first report on the clinical features and
risk factors of liver injury in patients with <italic>Chlamydia
psittaci</italic> pneumonia.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We retrospectively collected the clinical parameters for 46 patients
with <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic> pneumonia admitted to Jinhua
Central Hospital from January 2019 to February 2023. We analyzed the
liver function parameters and summarized the clinical characteristics
and risk factors of liver injury.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Among the 46 patients, 39 (84.8%) had abnormal liver function, and 23
(50.0%) had liver injury. The ratio of patients with a history of
alcohol consumption (39.1% vs. 4.3%, <italic>P</italic> =0.004) or
severe pneumonia (56.5% vs. 26.1%, <italic>P</italic> =0.036) was higher
in the liver injury group compared with the non-liver injury group.
Laboratory tests showed higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the
liver injury group (<italic>P &lt;</italic>0.001). The optimal cut-off
LDH level associated with liver injury was 473 IU/L as determined by ROC
curve analysis. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis
demonstrated that a history of alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] =
11.251; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.022 ~ 123.897,
<italic>P</italic> =0.048) and an LDH level of ≥ 473IU/L (OR = 11.635,
95% CI = 1.832 ~ 73.869, <italic>P</italic> =0.009) were independent
risk factors for liver injury.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
A history of alcohol consumption and an LDH level of over 473 IU/L are
independent risk factors for <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic>
pneumonia-related liver injury. It is recommended that particular
attention be given to monitoring and evaluating liver function
parameters when treating patients with <italic>Chlamydia
psittaci</italic> pneumonia who have a high LDH level and history of
alcohol consumption.

</title>
<p>
Nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> is a significant public health

</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A total of 19 nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains were
characterized through serovar identification, antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST), biofilm formation assessment. Genetic
relatedness was determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE). WGS was employed to decipher the resistance mechanism and to
contextualize the <italic>S.</italic> serovar Mbandaka strains among
previously sequenced isolates in China. The biofilm associated
<italic>mrkA</italic> gene was examined by PCR.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The predominant serovar identified was <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis,
followed by <italic>S.</italic> Mbandaka, <italic>S.</italic> Thompson,
<italic>S.</italic> Livingston, <italic>S.</italic> Alachua, and
<italic>S.</italic> Infantis. PFGE analysis indicated a notable genetic
similarity among the <italic>S.</italic> Mbandaka isolates. Phylogenetic
analysis suggested that these strains were likely derived from a single
source that had persisted in China for over five years. One multidrug
resistance (MDR) <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis isolate carried a
highly transferable IncB/O/K/Z plasmid with
<italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub>. One <italic>S.</italic>
Thompson strain, harboring the <italic>mrkABCDF</italic> operon in an
IncX1 plasmid, isolated from cutaneous lesions, demonstrated robust
biofilm formation. However, no <italic>mrkABCDF</italic> loci were
detected in other strains.

</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study emphasizes the importance of persisted surveillance and prompt
response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections to protect public
health. The dissemination of
<italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub>-harboring IncB/O/K/Z plasmid and
the spread of virulent <italic>mrkABCDF</italic> operon among
<italic>Salmonella</italic> in China and other global regions warrant

Alexandria, Egypt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Multidrug resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is one of
the most important nosocomial pathogens worldwide. During the last
decades it has become a major threat for healthcare settings due to the
high antibiotic resistance rates among these isolates. Many resistance
determinants are coded by conjugative or mobilizable plasmids,
facilitating their dissemination. The majority of plasmids harbored by
<italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species are less than 20 Kb, however,
high molecular weight elements are the most clinically relevant since
they usually contain antibiotic resistance genes. The aim of this work
was to describe, classify and determine the genetic content of plasmids
harbored by carbapem resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates
belonging to predominant clonal lineages circulating in hospitals from
Alexandria, Egypt. The isolates were subjected to S1-Pulsed Field Gel
Electrophoresis experiments to identify high molecular weight plasmids.
To further analyze the plasmid content and the genetic localization of
the antibiotic resistance genes, isolates were sequenced by Illumina
Miseq and MinION Mk1C and a hybrid assembly was performed using
Unicycler v0.5.0. Plasmids were detected with MOBsuite 3.0.3 and
Copla.py v.1.0 and mapped using the online software Proksee.ca.
Replicase genes were further analyzed through a BLAST against the
<italic>Acinetobacter</italic> Plasmid Typing database. Eleven plasmids
ranging in size from 4.9 to 205.6 Kb were characterized and mapped. All
isolates contained plasmids, and, in many cases, more than two elements
were identified. Antimicrobial resistance genes such as
<italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-23</sub>,
<italic>bla</italic><sub>GES-like</sub>, <italic>aph(3’)-VI</italic> and
<italic>qacEΔ1</italic> were found in likely conjugative large plasmids;
while virulence determinants such as septicolysin or TonB-dependent
receptors were identified in plasmids of small size. Some of these
resistance determinants were, in turn, located within transposons and
class 1 integrons. Among the identified plasmids, the majority encoded
proteins belonging to the Rep_3 family, but replicases of the RepPriCT_1
(Aci6) family were also identified. Plasmids are of high interest as
antibiotic resistance control tools, since they may be used as genetic
markers for antibiotic resistance and virulence, and also as targets for
the development of compounds that can inhibit transfer processes.

<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://i4oa.org/" target="_blank">Initiative for Open
Abstracts (I4OA)</a> was launched in September 2020 to advocate and
promote the unrestricted availability of the abstracts of the world’s
scholarly publications, particularly journal articles and book chapters,
in trusted repositories where they are open and machine-accessible. I4OA
calls on all scholarly publishers to open the abstracts of their
published works and, where possible, to submit them to Crossref.
</p>
<p>
Since the launch of I4OA, we have been tracking the openness of
abstracts for all Crossref members over time (for data and code, see
this <a href="https://github.com/bmkramer/I4OA" target="_blank">GitHub
repository</a>). For a subset of 40+, mostly larger, publishers, the
proportion of current journal articles (published in the current year
and preceding two years) that have abstracts deposited in Crossref is
shown in a
<a href="https://i4oa.org/#:~:text=are%20shown%20in-,orange,-." target="_blank">chart
on the I4OA website</a>, which is updated quarterly (Figure 1).

<em>Figure 1: Proportion of current journal articles from selected
publishers that have open abstracts in Crossref. Data collected on
January 1, 2024 for publication years 2021-2023. Publishers already
supporting I4OA are shown in orange.</em>
</p>
<p>
These longitudinal data and accompanying visualisations allow us to
identify and highlight good examples from 2023: publishers (both large
and small) who newly started to make abstracts openly available last
year and/or who managed to get the proportion of their articles with
open abstracts close to 100%<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
While we highlight some of these examples below in our ‘Hall of Fame’,
it’s important to also acknowledge all the publishers that already were
depositing abstracts to Crossref for most or all of their journal
articles prior to 2023, thereby contributing to the availability of
abstracts as part of a rich ecosystem of open metadata,
<a href="https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/why-openly-available-abstracts-are-important-overview-of-the-current-state-of-affairs" target="_blank">for
others to use and build upon</a>.

Hall of Fame - Part 1: publishers included in I4OA visualisation
</h2>
<p>
For the set of (mostly larger) publishers included in the visualisation
on the I4OA website, Figure 2 shows the difference in the proportion of
abstracts available in Crossref between January and December 2023 for
journal articles published in 2021-2023.
</p>
<p>
A number of publishers stand out from this figure:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Wiley</strong> announced in
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/network/publishing/research-publishing/open-access/wiley-expands-commitment-to-open-research" target="_blank">October
2022</a> that it was joining I4OA and would be making abstracts
available through Crossref. In August 2023, Wiley started to deposit
abstracts to Crossref, and at the end of 2023, the proportion of current
journal articles with open abstracts was 77%.
</p>
<p>
This makes Wiley the first of the four largest traditional commercial
publishers to deposit abstracts for the majority of journal articles
they publish. Springer Nature does this only for their current open
access articles, while Elsevier and Taylor &amp; Francis<sup>2</sup> do
not yet provide abstracts to Crossref at all. SAGE, the fifth largest
traditional commercial publisher, was a founding member of I4OA and has
open abstracts for 85% of current journal articles. <br><br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Among society publishers, the <strong>American Geophysical Union
(AGU)</strong> went from 7% to 99% open abstracts for current journal
articles last year, which is a great achievement. The publishing arm of
the <strong>American Institute of Physics (AIP Publishing)</strong>
joins them in reaching close to 100% open abstracts, going from 41% to
95% in 2023.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
<sup>1</sup>Depending on the type of journal(s) of a given publisher,
the maximal coverage of open abstracts will often be somewhat below
100%, as in Crossref, all journal content is assigned the type ‘journal
article’. This includes e.g. editorials, letters to the editor and other
publication types that are not always expected to have abstracts.
</p>
<p>
<sup>2</sup>The numbers for Wiley and Taylor &amp; Francis do not
include Hindawi and F1000 Research, respectively, as these have separate
Crossref member IDs. As most full open access publishers, both Hindawi
and F1000 Research have high proportions of open abstracts (81% and 98%,
respectively).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>CAIRN</strong> and <strong>Project Muse</strong>, two publishing
platforms in the humanities and social sciences representing a number of
individual publishers, both started including abstracts in the metadata
they provide to Crossref in 2023. At the end of 2023, CAIRN had
abstracts available for 41% of current journal articles, while Project
Muse was just starting out at 5%. Both will hopefully increase further
this coming year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Returning to traditional commercial publishers, <strong>Wolters Kluwer
Health</strong>, part of Wolters Kluwer, had seen a slow growth in the
proportion of journal articles with open abstracts in the years prior to
2023, going from 2% to 10%. However, they showed a rapid increase in
2023, ending the year with 52% open abstracts.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
While it is good to see publishers who have publicly committed their
<a href="https://i4oa.org/#:~:text=Publishers%20supporting%20I4OA" target="_blank">support
for I4OA</a> follow through with opening their abstracts (like Wiley and
AIP), it is also very encouraging to see publishers who are not (yet)
listed as I4OA supporters do so. This shows a growing awareness and
action on this issue beyond advocacy through I4OA alone. And of course,
we would love to list these publishers on our website as official
supporters of I4OA!
</p>
<p>
Figure 2 also shows some cases where the proportion of open abstracts
has gone down during the year. This can be due to temporary technical
issues in depositing abstracts (as was the case for Hindawi).
Theoretically, the proportion of open abstracts can also go down when
publishers stop providing abstracts altogether during the year, but we
have not observed that to be the case.

<p>
Among the many publishers not included in the limited selection shown in
the I4OA visualisation, there are also some interesting highlights of
publishers either starting out to deposit abstracts (and reaching a
sizeable proportion) or having deposited open abstracts for almost all
their current journal articles in 2023. The examples below drew our
attention in 2023; they include a number of medium-sized publishers as
well as a group of smaller publishers that deserve special attention.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)</strong> went
from 0% to 42% open abstracts in 2023. However, from January 2024
onwards, several EMBO journals were transferred to Springer Nature, so
EMBO can no longer be tracked at publisher level in Crossref. It will
still be possible to look at the development of open abstracts for
individual EMBO journals.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)</strong>, a
medium-sized publisher, started to deposit abstracts in 2023, reaching
33% open abstracts for current journal articles at the end of the year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Acoustical Society of America (ASA)</strong> had open
abstracts for almost all their current journal articles at the end
of 2023, increasing from 50% to 97%.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finally, in the second quarter of 2023, a group of <strong>over 200
smaller Turkish publishers</strong> saw large increases in their
coverage of open abstracts, resulting in open abstracts for 95%-100% of
their current journal articles. Consultation with Crossref pointed to
the potential supporting role of
<a href="https://dergipark.org.tr/en/" target="_blank">DergiPark</a>,
one of the largest Crossref sponsors in Turkey. This is a great example
of developments in open metadata at smaller publishers.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-forward">
Looking forward 
</h2>
<p>
At the beginning of 2024, the proportion of current journal articles
published by Crossref members with open abstracts has reached 49.7%, up
from 20.7% when I4OA was launched in September 2020. This is thanks to a
growing number of publishers who are depositing abstracts to Crossref,
often depositing open abstracts for close to 100% of their journal
articles.
</p>
<p>
This blog post has highlighted a number of publishers who contributed to
this growth in the availability of open abstracts in 2023. We hope these
examples will inspire other publishers to start doing the same and are
looking forward to following the growth in the availability of open
abstracts in 2024.
</p>
<p>
For publishers that started to deposit abstracts in recent years and are
doing so for newly published articles only, our data on open abstracts
for current journal articles will look better in 2024 than in 2023, as
only articles published in the current year and two preceding years are
taken into account.
</p>
<p>
However, the benefits of having abstracts openly available from a
central location such as Crossref (both for direct usage and for
integration in other open scholarly infrastructures) are not limited to
recent publications only. Hopefully, publishers currently depositing
abstracts to Crossref will continue to do so both for newly published
articles as well as for the backfiles of journal articles already
published.
</p>
<p>
Publishers who would like to be added to the list of I4OA supporters, or
who would like more information on how to deposit abstracts for both new
and existing journal articles, are very welcome to
<a href="mailto:openabstracts@gmail.com">reach out to I4OA</a>. More
information about open abstracts in general, and I4OA in particular, can
also be found in the
<a href="https://i4oa.org/faqs.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the I4OA
