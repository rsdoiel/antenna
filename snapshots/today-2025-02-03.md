## A computer can never be held accountable

date: 2025-02-03, updated: 2025-02-03, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/bumblebike/status/832394003492564993">A computer can never be held accountable</a></strong></p>
This legendary page from an internal IBM training in 1979 could not be more appropriate for our new age of AI.</p>
<p><img alt="A COMPUTER CAN NEVER BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THEREFORE A COMPUTER MUST NEVER MAKE A MANAGEMENT DECISION" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable.jpg" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A computer can never be held accountable</strong></p>
<p><strong>Therefore a computer must never make a management decision</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in June 2024 I <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1798168995373498524">asked on Twitter</a> if anyone had more information on the original source.</p>
<p>Jonty Wareing <a href="https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1798170111058264280">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was found by someone going through their father's work documents, and subsequently destroyed in a flood.</p>
<p>I spent some time corresponding with the IBM archives but they can't locate it. Apparently it was common for branch offices to produce things that were not archived.</p>

<p>Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1727344374370222264">the reply</a> Jonty got back from IBM:</p>

<p>I believe the image was first shared online in <a href="https://twitter.com/bumblebike/status/832394003492564993">this tweet</a> by @bumblebike in February 2017.

<p>Here's <a href="https://twitter.com/bumblebike/status/1468346709994582020">another tweet from @bumblebike</a> from December 2021 about the flood:</p>

## Elon Musk’s Directive on How to Change a Light Bulb in a Federal Building

date: 2025-02-03, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p><i>&#8220;Elon Musk’s government-slashing crew, the “department of government efficiency,” has been given access to the federal payment system, exposing the sensitive personal data of millions of Americans as well as details of public contractors who compete directly with Musk’s own businesses, an influential US senator has confirmed.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/02/elon-musk-doge-access-federal-payment-system">The Guardian</a></i></p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p>1. Find a functioning light bulb in a busy work area.</p> <p>2. Strike the light bulb with a private-sector-manufactured hammer or other hard object.</p> <p>3. Note any employee who pauses work at the noise or gets distracted. Refer them for Justice Department investigation.</p> <p>4. Fire the first five people who try to sweep up the shards of glass. They are obviously Biden dead-enders who just want to maintain the wasteful and ineffective status quo.</p> <p>5. Document the waste, fraud, and abuse of federal workers as they stumble around slowly in the dark, often bumping into each other and the walls of cubicles.</p> <p>6. Declare a state of emergency in the work area due to decreased productivity.</p> <p>7. Call in one of Peter Thiel&#8217;s high school interns to work with Grok to create a new staffing plan for <span class="caps">DOGE</span>.</p> <p>8. Authorize an immediate consulting fee to SpaceX (nominal, $1-5 million), which is developing a low-orbit illumination system to make lightbulbs obsolete.</p> <p>9. As employees leave at the end of the day, lock the doors behind them.</p> <p>10. Rename the office to something like the Bureau of Endangered Grout Worm Protection, The Gay Communist Puppetworks Promotion Department, or the Office for Sneering at Real America.</p> <p>11. Permanently close the office and terminate all its functions.</p> <p>12. Post on X that you&#8217;ve just saved taxpayers $1 trillion. Elon will boost.</p>

## OpenAI reasoning models: Advice on prompting

date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#advice-on-prompting">OpenAI reasoning models: Advice on prompting</a></strong></p>
OpenAI's documentation for their o1 and o3 "reasoning models" includes some interesting tips on how to best prompt them:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Developer messages are the new system messages:</strong> Starting with <code>o1-2024-12-17</code>, reasoning models support <code>developer</code> messages rather than <code>system</code> messages, to align with the <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#follow-the-chain-of-command">chain of command behavior described in the model spec</a>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This appears to be a purely aesthetic change made for consistency with their <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Apr/23/the-instruction-hierarchy/">instruction hierarchy</a> concept. As far as I can tell the old <code>system</code> prompts continue to work exactly as before - you're encouraged to use the new <code>developer</code> message type but it has no impact on what actually happens.</p>
<p>Since my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool already bakes in a <code>llm --system "system prompt"</code> option which works across multiple different models from different providers I'm not going to rush to adopt this new language!</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use delimiters for clarity:</strong> Use delimiters like markdown, XML tags, and section titles to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input, helping the model interpret different sections appropriately.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Anthropic have been encouraging <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags">XML-ish delimiters</a> for a while (I say -ish because there's no requirement that the resulting prompt is valid XML). My <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> tool has a <code>-c</code> option which outputs Claude-style XML, and in my experiments this same option works great with o1 and o3 too:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>git clone https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> limbo/bindings/python

files-to-prompt <span class="pl-c1">.</span> -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> llm -m o3-mini \
  -o reasoning_effort high \
  --system <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a detailed README with extensive usage examples<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit additional context in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):</strong> When providing additional context or documents, include only the most relevant information to prevent the model from overcomplicating its response.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes me thing that o1/o3 are not good models to implement RAG on at all - with RAG I like to be able to dump as much extra context into the prompt as possible and leave it to the models to figure out what's relevant.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Try zero shot first, then few shot if needed:</strong> Reasoning models often don't need few-shot examples to produce good results, so try to write prompts without examples first. If you have more complex requirements for your desired output, it may help to include a few examples of inputs and desired outputs in your prompt. Just ensure that the examples align very closely with your prompt instructions, as discrepancies between the two may produce poor results.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Providing examples remains the single most powerful prompting tip I know, so it's interesting to see advice here to only switch to examples if zero-shot doesn't work out.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be very specific about your end goal:</strong> In your instructions, try to give very specific parameters for a successful response, and encourage the model to keep reasoning and iterating until it matches your success criteria.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense: reasoning models "think" until they reach a conclusion, so making the goal as unambiguous as possible leads to better results.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Markdown formatting:</strong> Starting with <code>o1-2024-12-17</code>, reasoning models in the API will avoid generating responses with markdown formatting. To signal to the model when you <strong>do</strong> want markdown formatting in the response, include the string <code>Formatting re-enabled</code> on the first line of your <code>developer</code> message.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This one was a <em>real shock</em> to me! I noticed that o3-mini was outputting <code>•</code> characters instead of Markdown <code>*</code> bullets and initially thought <a href="https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1886121477822648441">that was a bug</a>.</p>
<p>I first saw this while running this prompt against <a href="https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo/tree/main/bindings/python">limbo/bindings/python</a> using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>git clone https://github.com/tursodatabase/limbo
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> limbo/bindings/python

files-to-prompt <span class="pl-c1">.</span> -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> llm -m o3-mini \
  -o reasoning_effort high \
  --system <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Write a detailed README with extensive usage examples<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/f8283d68e9bd7ad3f140d52cad6874a7">full result</a>, which includes text like this (note the weird bullets):</p>
<pre><code>Features
--------
• High‑performance, in‑process database engine written in Rust  
• SQLite‑compatible SQL interface  
• Standard Python DB‑API 2.0–style connection and cursor objects

<p>I ran it again with this modified prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Formatting re-enabled. Write a detailed README with extensive usage examples.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this time got back <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/adf64108d65cd5c10ac9fce953ab437e">proper Markdown, rendered in this Gist</a>. That did a really good job, and included bulleted lists using this valid Markdown syntax instead:</p>

I&#39;m 99.9% sure, as crazy as it sounds, when Musk is finished with his software project, you will have to use X for everything related to the government. To pay taxes, to receive health care, to renew your passport. And if you try to arrest him, he&#39;ll stop paying interest on the US debt, and that will be the end of the dollar as the reserve currency. He won&#39;t just control the US government, he will control the world economy

## Quoting Benedict Evans

date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2025/1/the-problem-with-better-models"><p>Part of the concept of ‘Disruption’ is that important new technologies tend to be bad at the things that matter to the previous generation of technology, but they do something else important instead. Asking if an LLM can do very specific and precise information retrieval might be like asking if an Apple II can match the uptime of a mainframe, or asking if you can build Photoshop inside Netscape. No, they can’t really do that, but that’s not the point and doesn’t mean they’re useless. They do something else, and that ‘something else’ matters more and pulls in all of the investment, innovation and company creation. Maybe, 20 years later, they can do the old thing too - maybe you can run a bank on PCs and build graphics software in a browser, eventually - but that’s not what matters at the beginning. They unlock something else. </p>
<p>What is that ‘something else’ for generative AI, though? How do you think conceptually about places where that error rate is a feature, not a bug?</p></blockquote>

## llm-anthropic

date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic">llm-anthropic</a></strong></p>
I've renamed my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3</a> plugin to <code>llm-anthropic</code>, on the basis that Claude 4 will probably happen at some point so this is a better name for the plugin.</p>
<p>If you're a previous user of <code>llm-claude-3</code> you can upgrade to the new plugin like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install -U llm-claude-3
</code></pre>
<p>This should remove the old plugin and install the new one, because the latest <code>llm-claude-3</code> depends on <code>llm-anthropic</code>. Just installing <code>llm-anthropic</code> may leave you with both plugins installed at once.</p>
<p>There is one extra manual step you'll need to take during this upgrade: creating a new <code>anthropic</code> stored key with the same API token you previously stored under <code>claude</code>. You can do that like so:</p>
<pre><code>llm keys set anthropic --value "$(llm keys get claude)"
</code></pre>
<p>I released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/releases/tag/0.12">llm-anthropic 0.12</a> yesterday with new features not previously included in <code>llm-claude-3</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Support for Claude's <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prefill-claudes-response">prefill</a> feature, using the new <code>-o prefill '{'</code> option and the accompanying <code>-o hide_prefill 1</code> option to prevent the prefill from being included in the output text. <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-anthropic/issues/2">#2</a></li>
<li>New <code>-o stop_sequences '```'</code> option for specifying one or more stop sequences. To specify multiple stop sequences pass a JSON array of strings :<code>-o stop_sequences '["end", "stop"]</code>.</li>
<li>Model options are now documented in the README.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If you install or upgrade <code>llm-claude-3</code> you will now get <code>llm-anthropic</code> instead, thanks to a tiny package on PyPI which depends on the new plugin name. I created that with my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/pypi-rename">pypi-rename</a> cookiecutter template.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3/issues/31">issue for the rename</a>. I archived the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-claude-3">llm-claude-3 repository on GitHub</a>, and got to use the brand new <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/30/pypi-now-supports-project-archival/">PyPI archiving feature</a> to archive the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/llm-claude-3/">llm-claude-3 project on PyPI</a> as well.

## A professional workflow for translation using LLMs

date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897856">A professional workflow for translation using LLMs</a></strong></p>
Tom Gally is a <a href="https://gally.net/translation.html">professional translator</a> who has been exploring the use of LLMs since the release of GPT-4. In this Hacker News comment he shares a detailed workflow for how he uses them to assist in that process.</p>
<p>Tom starts with the source text and custom instructions, including context for how the translation will be used. <a href="https://www.gally.net/temp/20250201sampletranslationprompt.html">Here's an imaginary example prompt</a>, which starts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>The text below in Japanese is a product launch presentation for Sony's new gaming console, to be delivered by the CEO at Tokyo Game Show 2025. Please translate it into English. Your translation will be used in the official press kit and live interpretation feed. When translating this presentation, please follow these guidelines to create an accurate and engaging English version that preserves both the meaning and energy of the original: [...]</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It then lists some tone, style and content guidelines custom to that text.</p>
<p>Tom runs that prompt through several different LLMs and starts by picking sentences and paragraphs from those that form a good basis for the translation.</p>
<p>As he works on the full translation he uses Claude to help brainstorm alternatives for tricky sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I am unable to think of a good English version for a particular sentence, I give the Japanese and English versions of the paragraph it is contained in to an LLM (usually, these days, Claude) and ask for ten suggestions for translations of the problematic sentence. Usually one or two of the suggestions work fine; if not, I ask for ten more. (Using an LLM as a sentence-level thesaurus on steroids is particularly wonderful.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He uses another LLM and prompt to check his translation against the original and provide further suggestions, which he occasionally acts on. Then as a final step he runs the finished document through a text-to-speech engine to try and catch any "minor awkwardnesses" in the result.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> this as an example of an expert using LLMs as tools to help further elevate their work. I'd love to read more examples <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42897856">like this one</a> from experts in other fields.

## Hacker News conversation on feature flags

date: 2025-02-02, updated: 2025-02-02, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42899778#42900221">Hacker News conversation on feature flags</a></strong></p>
I posted the following comment in a thread on Hacker News about feature flags, in response to this article <a href="https://code.mendhak.com/hardcode-feature-flags/">It’s OK to hardcode feature flags</a>. This kicked off a <em>very</em> high quality conversation on build-vs-buy and running feature flags at scale involving a bunch of very experienced and knowledgeable people. I recommend reading the comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single biggest value add of feature flags is that they de-risk deployment. They make it less frightening and difficult to turn features on and off, which means you'll do it more often. This means you can build more confidently and learn faster from what you build. That's worth a lot.</p>
<p>I think there's a reasonable middle ground-point between having feature flags in a JSON file that you have to redeploy to change and using an (often expensive) feature flags as a service platform: roll your own simple system.</p>
<p>A relational database lookup against primary keys in a table with a dozen records is effectively free. Heck, load the entire collection at the start of each request - through a short lived cache if your profiling says that would help.</p>
<p>Once you start getting more complicated (flags enabled for specific users etc) you should consider build-vs-buy more seriously, but for the most basic version you really can have no-deploy-changes at minimal cost with minimal effort.</p>
<p>There are probably good open source libraries you can use here too, though I haven't gone looking for any in the last five years.</p>
