<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
The GPD Pocket 4 is a mini-laptop that seems like a natural evolution of
the GPD Pocket 3 that first launched nearly three years ago. The new
model has a similar design that includes a QWERTY keyboard, a hinge that
lets you swivel the screen and fold it down over the keyboard for use in

<p>date: 2024-11-01, from: Liliputing</p>
<p>
There are a few ways to keep costs down when building a mini PC. One is
to opt for an inexpensive, low-power processor like an Intel Alder
Lake-N chip. Another is to just use older processors that are no longer
state-of-the-art. Chuwi’s new UBox mini PC takes the latter approach.
It’s a small desktop computer […]

<p>I’m a fan of Kong the CLI argument parser, I use it to automatically
create manual pages, (bash) completion and do a lot of validation inside
it. (This guy also has other really interesting packages, and he’s a
huge fan of Go’s struct tags). I wanted to do validation inside Kong as
well, for this Kong has validation, which is just a method (Validate()
error) on a type. Now most types I have are just string or any other
builtin type.</p>

That means net-gen flagship phones from companies like Samsung are more

<h2 id="harris-for-president">Harris for President</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons’ blog)</p>
<p>
Donald Trump is a gross villain and a traitor to our country. He’s a
convicted felon, adjudicated rapist, and head of a criminal
organization; he works with criminals and he pardons criminals; he’s a
narcissist and violent insurrectionist, racist and misogynist; he’s the
master of lies and corruption and self-serving.
</p>
<p>
He plans to rule as a fascist dictator, and this time has the backing to
do so, for the benefit of him and his ultra-wealthy friends. Not for
you.
</p>
<p>
For everybody else, the various enemies within — everybody who isn’t a
straight white male who goes along with the program — there will be
concentration camps, deportation, prison, and rumors and threats of
each. There will be more deaths in hospital parking lots.
</p>
<p>
I have voted for Kamala Harris. I ask you to vote for her too.
</p>
<p>
I happen to think Harris would be very good, possibly even great, as
president. But it hardly matters!
</p>
<p>
Voting for her is how we stop this. And we have to stop this.

Provided Gender Detection AI on Accident</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: 404 Media Group</p>
<p>Microsoft said it would retire its AI-powered gender classifier in
2022. Now it says some users still had access to it because of an
error.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-31, from: 404 Media Group</p>
<p>By documenting her transition every week on Instagram this artist
shows the absurdity in how Instagram and AI classify gender and the
human body.</p>

Pino is back in Victoria. Being back in a city also means that we are
shipping <a href="https://100r.co/site/store.html#stickers">sticker
sheets</a> again! Devine found a spirograph set at a thrift store for
5$, we now make
<a href="https://100r.co/media/content/stream/2024_spiro.jpg">patterns</a>
on every letter we ship.
</p>
<p>
We are happy to announce the official release of
<a href="https://100r.co/site/rabbit_waves.html">Rabbit Waves</a>! The
idea for the project came after discussing the disappearance of certain
traditional seasteading skills and maritime communication knowledge that
we believe are valuable when electronics misbehave, but that are also
just generally fun to learn and use. The world of the micro-site will
grow as we think of new ideas to expand it.
</p>
<p>
Devine participated in
<a href='https://forum.merveilles.town/thread/101/drawtober-2024-109/' target='_blank'>Drawtober</a>
again this year and completed a
<a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/pocket_rewriting.html" target="_blank">zine</a>
that teaches the basics of multiset rewriting with examples, it also
includes the source for a tiny Fractran interpreter. Since its release,
many people have printed their own. Avanier went a step further and
<a href="https://100r.co/media/content/stream/2024_joshavanier_zine.jpg" target="_blank">re-drew
the zine</a> on black paper! Devine also released an
<a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/tote.html" target="_blank">interactive
version</a>, and CapitalEx created with it a
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yiso80ANlc'>beautiful little
world to explore</a>!
<a href='https://handmadecities.com/seattle/'>Handmade Seattle 2024</a>
is coming up, Devine will be there to talk about weird computer stuff,
and will hand out copies of the zine too.

This year, we carved a Calcifer
