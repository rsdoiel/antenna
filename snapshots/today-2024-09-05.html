<h2 id="hunter-biden-arrives-at-los-angeles-court-for-tax-trial">Hunter
Biden arrives at Los Angeles court for tax trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — Hunter Biden arrived Thursday at a Los Angeles
courthouse for the first day of jury selection in his federal tax trial,
just months after the president’s son was convicted of gun charges in a
separate case.</p>
<p>The case accuses Hunter Biden of a four-year scheme to avoid paying
at least $1.4 million in taxes while pulling in millions of dollars from
foreign business entities. He is already facing potential prison time
after a Delaware jury convicted him in June of lying on a 2018 federal
form to purchase a gun that he possessed for 11 days.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden walked into the courtroom holding hands with his wife,
Melissa Cohen Biden, and flanked by Secret Service agents. He has
pleaded not guilty to the charges related to his 2016 through 2019 taxes
and his attorneys have indicated they will argue he didn’t act
“willfully,” or with the intention to break the law, in part because of
his well-documented struggles with alcohol and drug addiction.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi, who was appointed to the bench by
former President Donald Trump, placed some restrictions on what jurors
will be allowed to hear about the traumatic events that Hunter Biden’s
family, friends and attorneys say led to his drug addiction.</p>
<p>The judge barred attorneys from connecting his substance abuse
struggles to the 2015 death of his brother Beau Biden from cancer or the
car accident that killed his mother and sister when he was a toddler. He
also rejected a proposed defense expert lined up to testify about
addiction.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges that Hunter Biden lived lavishly while
flouting the tax law, spending his cash on things like strippers and
luxury hotels — “in short, everything but his taxes.”</p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s attorneys had asked Scarsi to also limit prosecutors
from highlighting details of his expenses that they say amount to a
“character assassination,” including payments made to strippers or
pornographic websites. The judge has said in court papers that he will
maintain “strict control” over the presentation of potentially salacious
evidence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prosecutors could present more details of Hunter Biden’s
overseas dealings, which have been at the center of Republican
investigations into the Biden family often seeking — without evidence—
to tie the president to an alleged influence peddling scheme.</p>
<p>The special counsel’s team has said it wants to tell jurors about
Hunter Biden’s work for a Romanian businessman, who they say sought to
“influence U.S. government policy” while Joe Biden was vice
president. </p>
<p>The defense accused prosecutors of releasing details about Hunter
Biden’s work for the Romanian in court papers to drum up media coverage
and taint the jury pool.</p>
<p>The judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of
questions to determine whether they can serve on the jury, including
whether their political views and knowledge of the case would prevent
them from being impartial.</p>
<p>Potential jurors are expected to be asked about their own family and
personal histories with substance abuse as well as any tax issues and
past dealings with the Internal Revenue Service. And despite President
Joe Biden dropping his bid for reelection, they’ll also answer questions
about whether they believe criminal charges can be filed for political
reasons.</p>
<p>A heavily scrutinized plea deal and diversion agreement that would
have prevented either trial from moving forward collapsed in July 2023
under questioning from a judge. Special counsel indicted Hunter Biden
soon after, splitting the deal into the Delaware gun charges and the
California tax case.</p>
<p>Sentencing in Hunter Biden’s Delaware conviction is set for Nov. 13.
He could face up to 25 years in prison, but as a first-time offender, he
is likely to get far less time or avoid prison entirely.</p>

id="us-china-rivalry-on-display-at-gathering-of-pacific-islands-leaders">US-China
rivalry on display at gathering of Pacific Islands leaders</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Efforts by Beijing to limit Taiwan’s participation in
the recently concluded Pacific Islands Forum underscore the intense and
ongoing tug-of-war between Western democracies and China for influence
in the region, analysts say.</p>
<p>During the Pacific Islands Forum, or PIF, which wrapped up Friday,
Beijing ally Solomon Islands tried unsuccessfully to block Taiwan from
future participation. Then, on Saturday, the PIF removed a reference to
Taiwan in its final communique after Beijing’s top Pacific diplomat
expressed outrage at its inclusion.</p>
<p>The communique originally reaffirmed a 30-year-old agreement allowing
Taiwan to take part in the PIF. That wording was later removed.
Beijing’s communist leaders insist that democratically ruled Taiwan is a
part of China and have worked for decades to limit the island’s
participation in international organizations.</p>
<p>After the references to Taiwan were removed, Taiwan’s Foreign
Ministry said in a statement on Saturday, “Taiwan issued the strongest
condemnation on China’s arbitrary intervention and unreasonable actions
that undermine regional peace and stability.”</p>
<p>However, the ministry said the revision did not undermine Taiwan’s
status at the forum or prevent it from participating in the future.</p>
<p>Asia Group senior adviser Kathryn Paik, who helped lead the creation
of the first U.S.-Pacific Islands Forum Summit while at the U.S.
National Security Council, said that while Taiwan’s status as a
development partner is still solid, what happened highlights the
intensity of Beijing’s efforts in the region.</p>
<p>“China has made gaining access and influence in the Pacific a top
priority in recent years, sending savvy diplomats to the region. In
fact, China currently has vastly more diplomats on the ground in more
countries than the United States, outnumbering the U.S. in almost every
location,” Paik told VOA. “The pushback on the Solomon Islands’ attempt
— which was transparently an attempt by China — to remove Taiwan as a
development partner to the PIF demonstrated the high regard that many
nations have for Taiwan’s contributions to Pacific development.”</p>
<p>PIF officials did not explain why Taiwan was removed from the
communique but stressed that the PIF would continue to welcome Taiwan at
its regional meetings.</p>
<p>Nikkei Asia reported that Chinese Special Envoy for the Pacific Qian
Bo told reporters Friday the reference was “a mistake” that “should be
corrected.”</p>
<p>“Taiwan is part of China. Taiwan is not a dialogue partner of PIF, so
China has the representation on behalf of the whole China, including
Taiwan and the mainland,” Qian said.</p>
<p>VOA reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington and the Solomon
Islands for comment but has yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>Partnership through 2027</p>
<p>On Sunday, Taiwan announced an agreement with the Pacific Islands to
extend the development partnership through 2027, according to a Foreign
Ministry statement.</p>
<p>The statement also highlighted programs Taiwan has supported in the
Pacific Islands, efforts that have focused on areas such as agriculture,
education, medical care, communications technology, women’s empowerment
and basic infrastructure.</p>
<p>Commenting Tuesday on China’s efforts at the PIF, the U.S. State
Department backed Taiwan’s continued right to attend regional
meetings.</p>
<p>“The PRC’s efforts to pressure Pacific Island countries to remove
this reference fit a pattern of PRC coercion to constrain Taiwan’s
international position,” a State Department spokesperson told VOA, using
an abbreviation of the country’s formal name, the People’s Republic of
China. “Taiwan is a highly capable, engaged, democratic and responsible
member of the global community.”</p>
<p>US Pacific territories</p>
<p>While China and the United States maintain status as partner nations
in the PIF, U.S. territories Guam and American Samoa were granted status
as associate members during last week’s meetings. Although they do not
have voting rights, they will be able to provide speakers at plenary
sessions and nominate members to PIF working groups.</p>
<p>“The United States supports the U.S. Pacific territories’ increased
participation in the PIF and greater connectivity with PIF members,” a
State Department spokesperson told VOA.</p>
<p>The Asia Group’s Paik said that having two U.S. territories “more
tightly knit into the Pacific community” further reinforces that the
U.S. is a Pacific nation and opens opportunities for the U.S. to
influence decision-making at the forum.</p>
<p>Ivan Kanapathy, a former deputy senior director for Asian affairs at
the National Security Council, agrees.</p>
<p>“This will provide more allied voices and reduce PRC influence, which
often relies on elite capture,” said Kanapathy, an adjunct professor at
Georgetown University.</p>
<p>He added: “Washington must convince the region that it is willing to
impose real costs on Beijing — more than just diplomatic
statements.”</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from Reuters.</p>

id="britain-halts-criminal-proceedings-against-movie-producer-weinstein">Britain
halts criminal proceedings against movie producer Weinstein</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein won’t face
charges of indecent assault in Britain, prosecutors announced on
Thursday.</p>
<p>The Crown Prosecution Service, which in 2022 authorized two charges
of indecent assault against Weinstein, said it decided to discontinue
proceedings because there was “no longer a realistic prospect of
conviction.’’</p>
<p>“We have explained our decision to all parties,’’ the CPS said in a
statement. ’’We would always encourage any potential victims of sexual
assault to come forward and report to police, and we will prosecute
wherever our legal test is met.”</p>
<p>Weinstein became the most prominent villain of the #MeToo movement in
2017 when women began to go public with accounts of his behavior. After
the revelations emerged, British police said they were investigating
multiple allegations of sexual assault that reportedly took place
between the 1980s and 2015.</p>
<p>In June 2022, the Crown Prosecution Service said it had authorized
London’s Metropolitan Police Service to file two charges of indecent
assault against Weinstein in relation to an alleged incident that
occurred in London in 1996. The victim was in her 50s at the time of the
announcement.</p>
<p>Unlike many other countries, Britain does not have a statute of
limitations for rape or sexual assault.</p>
<p>Weinstein, who has denied that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone,
remains in custody in New York while awaiting retrial in Manhattan,
prosecutors said in August.</p>
<p>After the retrial, he is due to start serving a 16-year sentence in
California for a separate rape conviction in Los Angeles, authorities
said. Weinstein was convicted in Los Angeles in 2022 while already
serving a 23-year sentence in New York.</p>
<p>His 2020 conviction in Manhattan was thrown out earlier this year
when the state’s top court ruled that the judge in the original trial
unfairly allowed testimony against Weinstein based on allegations that
weren’t part of the case.</p>
<p>Weinstein, the co-founder of the Miramax entertainment company and
The Weinstein Company film studio, was once one of the most powerful
people in Hollywood, having produced films such as “Pulp Fiction” and
“The Crying Game.”</p>

$7.3 billion in grants for rural electric cooperatives to finance clean

Dairyland Power Cooperative in Wisconsin. Dairyland will receive $573
million for solar and wind installations across Wisconsin, Iowa,

id="trump-election-subversion-case-back-in-court-as-judge-holds-hearing-that-could-set-its-path-forward">Trump
election subversion case back in court as judge holds hearing that could
set its path forward</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A judge will hear arguments Thursday about the potential
next steps in the federal election subversion prosecution of Donald
Trump in the first hearing since the Supreme Court narrowed the case by
ruling that former presidents are entitled to broad immunity from
criminal charges.</p>
<p>Prosecutors and defense lawyers submitted dueling proposals late
Friday before the status conference. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan
is presiding over the case that charges Trump with plotting to overturn
the results of the 2020 election in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021 riot
at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump is not expected to be present, and it was not immediately clear
whether Chutkan will make any rulings Thursday.</p>
<p>Special counsel Jack Smith’s team filed a new indictment last week to
strip out certain allegations against Trump, the Republican nominee for
president, and comply with the Supreme Court ruling. His team said it
could be ready at any time to file a legal brief laying out its position
on how to apply the justices’ immunity opinion to the case. </p>
<p>Defense lawyers said they intend to file multiple motions to dismiss
the case, including one that piggybacks off a Florida judge’s ruling
that said Smith’s appointment was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Neither side envisions a trial happening before the November
election, especially given the amount of work ahead. Chutkan is tasked
with determining which of the acts alleged in the indictment can remain
part of the case in light of the Supreme Court opinion.</p>
<p>The justices in July ruled that former presidents enjoy absolute
immunity for the exercise of their core constitutional duties and are
presumptively immune from prosecution for all other official acts. </p>
<p>Smith’s team responded to the ruling with a revised indictment last
week that removed references to Trump’s efforts to use the law
enforcement powers of the Justice Department to remain in power, an area
of conduct for which the Supreme Court said Trump is immune. </p>
<p>The case is one of two federal prosecutions against Trump. The other,
charging him with illegally hoarding classified documents at his
Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, was dismissed in July by U.S.
District Judge Aileen Cannon. She said Smith’s appointment as special
counsel was unlawful.</p>
<p>Smith’s team has appealed that ruling. Trump’s lawyers say they
intend to ask Chutkan to dismiss the election case on the same
grounds.</p>

As a new graduate student at Northeastern University in the 2010s, I

multimodal writing. Touted as a more accessible, creative, and enjoyable
approach to teaching writing, the assignments that the speaker shared
looked like shadowboxes filled with visual and textual content. I sat

id="teen-charged-with-killing-4-at-georgia-high-school-had-been-focus-of-earlier-tips-about-threats">Teen
charged with killing 4 at Georgia high school had been focus of earlier
tips about threats</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WINDER, Ga. — More than a year ago, tips about online posts
threatening a school shooting led Georgia police to interview a
13-year-old boy, but investigators didn’t have enough evidence for an
arrest. On Wednesday, that boy opened fire at his high school outside
Atlanta and killed four people and wounded nine, officials said.</p>
<p>The teen has been charged as an adult in the deaths of Apalachee High
School students Mason Schermerhorn and Christian Angulo, both 14, and
instructors Richard Aspinwall, 39, and Christina Irimie, 53, Georgia
Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said at a news
conference.</p>
<p>At least nine other people — eight students and one teacher at the
school in Winder, about an hour’s drive northeast of Atlanta — were
taken to hospitals with injuries. All were expected to survive, Barrow
County Sheriff Jud Smith said.</p>
<p>The teen, now 14, was to be taken to a regional youth detention
facility on Thursday.</p>
<p>Armed with an assault-style rifle, the teen turned the gun on
students in a hallway at the school when classmates refused to open the
door for him to return to his algebra classroom, classmate Lyela
Sayarath said.</p>
<p>The teen earlier left the second period algebra classroom, and
Sayarath figured the quiet student who recently transferred was skipping
school again.</p>
<p>But he returned later and wanted back in the classroom. Some students
went to open the locked door but instead backed away.</p>
<p>“I’m guessing they saw something, but for some reason they didn’t
open the door,” Sayarath said.</p>
<p>When she looked at him through a window in the door, she saw the
student turn and heard a barrage of gunshots.</p>
<p>“It was about 10 or 15 of them at once, back-to-back,” she said.</p>
<p>The math students ducked onto the floor and sporadically crawled
around, looking for a safe corner to hide.</p>
<p>Two school resource officers encountered the shooter within minutes
after a report of shots fired went out, Hosey said. The teen immediately
surrendered and was taken into custody.</p>
<p>The teen had been interviewed after the FBI received anonymous tips
in May 2023 about online threats to commit an unspecified school
shooting, the agency said in a statement.</p>
<p>The FBI narrowed the threats down and referred the case to the
sheriff’s department in Jackson County, which is adjacent to Barrow
County.</p>
<p>The sheriff’s office interviewed the then-13-year-old and his father,
who said there were hunting guns in the house but the teen did not have
unsupervised access to them. The teen also denied making any online
threats.</p>
<p>The sheriff’s office alerted local schools for continued monitoring
of the teen, but there was no probable cause for arrest or additional
action, the FBI said.</p>
<p>Hosey said the state Division of Family and Children’s Services also
had previous contact with the teen and will investigate whether that has
any connection with the shooting. Local news outlets reported that law
enforcement on Wednesday searched the teen’s family home in Bethlehem,
Georgia, east of the high school.</p>
<p>“All the students that had to watch their teachers and their fellow
classmates die, the ones that had to walk out of the school limping,
that looked traumatized,” Sayarath said, “that’s the consequence of the
action of not taking control.”</p>
<p>Authorities were still looking into how the teen obtained the gun
used in the shooting and got it into the school with about 1,900
students in Barrow County, a rapidly suburbanizing area on the edge of
metro Atlanta’s ever-expanding sprawl.</p>
<p>It was the latest among dozens of school shootings across the U.S. in
recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut,
Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas. The classroom killings have set
off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents
whose children are growing up accustomed to active shooter drills in
classrooms. But they have done little to move the needle on national gun
laws.</p>
<p>Before Wednesday, there had been 29 mass killings in the U.S. so far
this year, according to a database maintained by The Associated Press
and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University. At least 127
people have died in those killings, which are defined as incidents in
which four or more people die within a 24-hour period, not including the
killer — the same definition used by the FBI.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, hundreds gathered in Jug Tavern Park in
downtown Winder for a vigil. Volunteers handed out candles and also
water, pizza and tissues. Some knelt as a Methodist minister led the
crowd in prayer after a Barrow County commissioner read a Jewish prayer
of mourning.</p>
<p>Christopher Vasquez, 15, said he attended the vigil because he needed
to feel grounded and be in a safe place.</p>
<p>He was in band practice when the lockdown order was issued. He said
it felt like a regular drill as students lined up to hide in the band
closet.</p>
<p>“Once we heard banging at the door and the SWAT (team) came to take
us out, that’s when I knew that it was serious,” he said. “I just
started shaking and crying.”</p>
<p>He finally settled down once he was at the football stadium. “I just
was praying that everyone I love was safe,” he said.</p>

Harris Has Other Things to Talk About Than Fracking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU4OTU0NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTQ2NzQzMH0.-JL0iiBTLKPwVrW6sk_VCBAIjl-AGgLB6R2phW9nTHg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Fracking is just about the last thing Kamala Harris wants to talk about
right now, which may be understandable. In a CNN
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/harris-walz-interview-read-transcript/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>interview</u></a>
last week — her first major sit-down since becoming the Democratic
Party’s official nominee for president — she changed her earlier
campaign position on whether the technique used to extract oil and
natural gas should be banned. Cries of “Flip-flopper!” are a staple of
shallow campaign coverage. The issue is a bit complicated, and could
prove awkward in at least one battleground state. And she’d rather spend
her limited time attacking Donald Trump on abortion and other issues
where she has a clearer advantage.
</p>
<p>
But when the fracking issue comes up again — and it will — Harris has a
great story to tell, one that most Americans are probably unaware of.
There’s a green energy revolution underway, but rather than celebrate
it, Harris and many other Democratic politicians tend to tiptoe around
the issue, apparently terrified that a single infelicitous sentence
could turn the supposedly large numbers of pro-fossil fuel voters
against them.
</p>
<p>
We saw that dynamic in action on CNN, when interviewer Dana Bash homed
right in on the fact that, running in the presidential primaries in
2020, Harris said she favored a ban on fracking. “Fracking, as you know,
is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of
Pennsylvania,” Bash said. “Do you still want to ban fracking?” Like
almost every political reporter, Bash has no interest in the benefits
and problems fracking presents, or whether banning it is a good or bad
idea. The point is to zing Harris for her apparent flip-flop and
speculate on whether it will move votes in one of the few swing states.
</p>
<p>
Harris was determined to allay the concerns of any pro-fracking voters
tuning in. “I would not ban fracking,” she said. “As vice president, I
did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” Loud and
clear!
</p>
<p>
She did go on to argue that a fracking ban is unnecessary because the
Inflation Reduction Act is creating large numbers of green energy jobs,
so “we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy
without banning fracking.” To the casual viewer, it probably seemed like
a perfectly good answer, but it was also somewhat beside the point. The
reason many would like to ban fracking isn’t that it holds back the
creation of green jobs. It’s that it entrenches our reliance on fossil
fuels and creates
<a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/fracking-gas-chemicals-health-pennsylvania" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>environmental
and health problems</u></a> in the areas where it is deployed.
</p>
<p>
Of course, all those considerations — jobs, the environment, and where
we’re getting our energy now and in the future — are interrelated. Which
is why there is an opportunity for Harris to use that question to focus
voters’ attention on the transformation now taking place.
</p>
<p>
With one party saying the only thing that matters in energy is drilling
for more fossil fuels and the other telling people not to worry because
they won’t stop us drilling for more fossil fuels, how many Americans
know about the dramatic increase in renewable energy, especially solar,
that is now underway?
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62864" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According</u></a>
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, nearly 50 gigawatts of
solar power will be added to the grid this year, accounting for 59% of
all new electricity generation:

</p>
</center>
<p>
Wind and solar now generate
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/us-wind-and-solar-on-track-to-overtake-coal-this-year/?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
electricity</u></a> than coal. Even more remarkable is how inexpensive
solar power has become. Since 1990, the price per kilowatt hour of a
solar panel
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
dropped</u></a> by 98%, and solar has become the
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/electricity_generation/pdf/AEO2023_LCOE_report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>least
expensive</u></a> type of new energy to generate. With all the
innovation taking place in the renewable energy world — a good deal of
it spurred by the investments made by the Biden administration — energy
prices are likely to keep coming down as more and more of our power is
generated by renewables.
</p>
<p>
This is a triumphant story of human ingenuity, thoughtful government
action, and the operation of the free market. Harris could use it to
describe a glorious future of power that is cheap, clean, and nearly
limitless, one she is trying to create and Trump is trying to impede.
Given that “We won’t go back” is one of her campaign slogans, it would
seem like a perfect fit for her. But like many Democrats, she seems wary
of saying anything that might spook the relatively small number of
people whose livelihoods depend on fracking.
</p>
<p>
Consider Pennsylvania, the only swing state where this issue is supposed
to matter. From the discussion in the political press, you might think
the state’s voters are almost unanimous in their devotion to fracking,
but that’s just not true. Even there, the public is closely divided on
the issue:
<a href="https://www.pghcitypaper.com/news/new-poll-shows-majority-of-pennsylvanians-oppose-fracking-17800496" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Some
polls</u></a> have found majorities of Pennsylvanians opposed to
fracking, while
<a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/32525-how-americans-feel-about-fracking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>others</u></a>
show them split down the middle. And while Pennsylvania produces a lot
of natural gas that way, the number of people who actually work in
fracking in the state is extremely modest,
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/07/01/1027822/fracking-boom-jobs-industry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
the low five figures</u></a>. Yet the assumption of news coverage is
that the contrast between the Biden administration’s emphasis on clean
energy and Trump’s opposite “Drill, baby, drill” approach can only
redound to Trump’s benefit; as one <em><em>Wall Street Journal</em></em>
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/fracking-boom-pennsylvania-trump-biden-voters-a360fd1b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a>
in April was headlined, “A Pennsylvania Fracking Boom Weighs on Biden’s
Re-Election Chances.” The Pennsylvanians who are opposed to fracking
because of its environmental impacts — or simply see it as something
their state no longer needs — are shoved to the periphery of that kind
of coverage.
</p>
<p>
So what if the next time she is asked about why she changed her mind
about a fracking ban, Harris took the opportunity to explain to people
what the future of energy is actually going to look like, and why it’s
so encouraging? She’ll have to do that over the objection (or at the
very least the indifference) of the reporters covering her campaign, who
neither know nor care about the substance of the climate issue or energy
policy. But she should do it anyway. Not only would it be right on the
merits, it might even be good politics.

id="white-house-signals-it-may-block-sale-of-us-steel-to-nippon-steel">White
House signals it may block sale of US Steel to Nippon Steel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House is signaling an openness to blocking the
acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel, as a government review of the
proposed takeover by the Japanese company is wrapping up. </p>
<p>The Washington Post reported Wednesday that President Joe Biden plans
to stop the deal from going forward. A White House official, insisting
on anonymity to discuss the matter, did not deny the report and said
Biden still needs to receive the official recommendation from the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). That
review could end as soon as this month. </p>
<p>Biden had voiced his objections to the merger, backing his supporters
in the United Steelworkers union who oppose the deal. The objection
carries weight as U.S. Steel is headquartered in the swing state of
Pennsylvania and is a symbol of Pittsburgh’s industrial might in an
election year when Republicans and Democrats alike are promising more
domestic manufacturing jobs. </p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, came out
against the deal this week. Former President Donald Trump, the
Republican nominee, has said he would block the merger if he were still
in the White House. </p>
<p>Stock in U.S. Steel fell roughly 17% on the news that Biden would
stop the merger. </p>
<p>The CFIUS review process generally pertains to business issues with
national security implications. U.S. Steel spokesperson Amanda Malkowski
said in an email that the company had not received any update on the
process and that the company sees “no national security issues
associated with this transaction, as Japan is one of our most staunch
allies.” </p>
<p>“We fully expect to pursue all possible options under the law to
ensure this transaction, which is best future for Pennsylvania, American
steelmaking, and all of our stakeholders, closes,” Malkowski said. </p>
<p>A spokesman representing Nippon Steel said the company had not
received any updates from the federal government on the review
process. </p>
<p>U.S. Steel on Wednesday hosted a rally in support of the acquisition.
It said in a statement that without the Nippon Steel deal the company
would “largely pivot away from its blast furnace facilities, putting
thousands of good-paying union jobs at risk, negatively impacting
numerous communities across the locations where its facilities exist,
and depriving the American steel industry of an opportunity to better
compete on the global stage.”</p>

id="chinas-envoy-not-expelled-he-left-because-term-ended-says-us">China’s
envoy not expelled; he left because term ended, says US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — China’s consul general in New York left his post as
scheduled after completing his posting last month, the State Department
said on Wednesday, hours after New York’s governor said she asked for
his expulsion in the aftermath of the arrest of a former aide who was
accused of secretly acting as a Chinese agent.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that
Consul General Huang Ping “was not expelled.”</p>
<p>“Our understanding is that the consul general reached the end of a
regular scheduled rotation in August, and so rotated out of the
position, but was not expelled,” Miller said.</p>
<p>“But of course, when it comes to the status of particular employees
of a foreign mission, I would refer you to the foreign country to speak
to it. But there was no expulsion action.”</p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests
for comment on Huang Ping’s status.</p>
<p>Governor asked for envoy’s expulsion</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul told an event
that she spoke by phone at the request of Secretary of State Antony
Blinken to a high-ranking State Department official “and I had conveyed
my desire to have the consul general from the People’s Republic of China
in the New York mission expelled.”</p>
<p>“And I’ve been informed that the consul general is no longer in the
New York mission,” she said.</p>
<p>Miller said Hochul had spoken on Wednesday to Deputy Secretary of
State Kurt Campbell.</p>
<p>Asked by an audience member if she had been interviewed by
investigators, including the FBI, Hochul said: “They asked me one
question.”</p>
<p>“I’m not able to talk about it but it had something to do with
identifying whether or not something was my signature and that was it,”
she said.</p>
<p>Former aide charged</p>
<p>Linda Sun, 41, a former aide to Hochul, was charged on Tuesday with
secretly acting as an agent of the Chinese government in exchange for
millions of dollars in compensation and gifts, including meals of
gourmet duck.</p>
<p>Sun and her husband, Chris Hu, 40, pleaded not guilty to criminal
charges before U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo in Brooklyn, after being
arrested on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn said that while working in state
government, Sun blocked representatives of the Taiwanese government from
meeting with officials and sought to arrange for a high-level New York
state official to visit China. In exchange, Chinese government
representatives allegedly arranged for millions of dollars in
transactions for Hu, who had business activities in China.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Sun and Hu used the money to buy a 2024 Ferrari Roma
sports car, as well as property on New York’s Long Island and in
Honolulu worth about $6 million.</p>
<p>Hochul was not accused of any wrongdoing. Her office fired Sun in
March 2023 after discovering evidence of misconduct and reported Sun’s
actions immediately to authorities. Her office also has assisted law
enforcement throughout the process, a spokesperson for the governor
said.</p>
<p>According to the website of China’s consulate in New York, Huang Ping
had been the consul general since November 2018. Prior to that, Huang,
61, served as a Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe and did stints as an
official at the embassy in Washington and China’s consulate in
Chicago.</p>

<h2 id="android-15-is-released-to-aosp">Android 15 is released to
AOSP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today we’re releasing Android 15 and making the source code available
at the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Android 15 will be available
on supported Pixel devices in the coming weeks, as well as on select
devices from Samsung, Honor, iQOO, Lenovo, Motorola, Nothing, OnePlus,
Oppo, realme, Sharp, Sony, Tecno, vivo, and Xiaomi in the coming months.
We’re proud to continue our work in open source through the AOSP. Open
source allows anyone to build upon and contribute to Android, resulting
in devices that are more diverse and innovative. You can leverage your
app development skills in Android Studio with Jetpack Compose to create
applications that thrive across the entire ecosystem. You can
even examine the source code for a deeper understanding of how Android
works. ↫ Matthew McCullough at the Android Developers blog While it’s
great that we’re still getting open source Android releases, the reality
of it is that Google has eroded so much away from the Android Open
Source Project that AOSP has become effectively useless. Back in the
olden days, AOSP was a complete mobile operating system, but those days
are long behind us. Google has moved so much from AOSP over to
proprietary frameworks, applications, and cloud services that running
that it’s no longer a complete package, which is a huge shame. Still,
AOSP plays an important role for the custom ROM community and the
various companies and communities making privacy-first, de-Googled
Android versions, and for that reason alone it’s good that it still
exists, even in its gutted state. Android 15’s AOSP release will surely
find its way to LineageOS, /e/OS, GrapheneOS, and the countless other
alternatives to butchered Android OEM versions and people seeking a more
private smartphone experience. As for when Android 15 will hit Pixels –
that’s going to be a few weeks from now, later than usual after the
source release.</p>

<h2 id="us-sailor-detained-in-venezuela">US sailor detained in
Venezuela</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — Venezuela has detained a U.S. Navy sailor who was visiting
the country while on personal travel, U.S. officials have confirmed to
VOA.</p>
<p>The reason for the detention is unknown.</p>
<p>A defense official who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity because
of international sensitivities said the sailor was detained “on or about
August 30, 2024, by Venezuelan law enforcement authorities while on
personal travel to Venezuela.”</p>
<p>“The U.S. Navy is looking into this and working closely with the
State Department,” the defense official added.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters Wednesday
that the U.S. was tracking the detention closely and was seeking
additional information.</p>
<p>National Security Council spokesman John Kirby added that the U.S.
was “obviously in touch” with Venezuelan authorities.</p>
<p>The tension in the U.S.-Venezuela relationship has been further
stretched since Venezuela held elections earlier this year.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has questioned the results that kept
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in power, stating last month that
“Maduro and his representatives have tampered with the results of that
election, falsely claimed victory and carried out widespread repression
to maintain power.”</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the U.S. seized Maduro’s plane over alleged
sanctions violations.</p>

id="programming-the-convergent-workslates-spreadsheet-microcassette-future">Programming
the Convergent WorkSlate’s spreadsheet microcassette future</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>That’s the 1983 Convergent WorkSlate, a one-of-a-kind handheld system
from some misty alternate history where VisiCalc ruled the earth.
Indeed, even the “software” packages Convergent shipped for it — on
microcassette, which could store voice memos and data — were nothing
more than cells and formulas in a worksheet. The built-in modem let you
exchange data with other Workslates (or even speak over the phone to
their users), and it came with a calculator desk accessory and a
rudimentary terminal program, but apart from those creature comforts its
built-in spreadsheet was the sole centre of your universe. And, unlike
IAI and the Canon Cat, I’ve yet to find any backdoor (secret or
otherwise) to enable anything else. That means anything you want to
program has to be somehow encoded in a spreadsheet too. Unfortunately,
when it comes to actually programming the device it turns out the worst
thing a spreadsheet on an 8-bit CPU can be is Turing-complete (so it’s
not), and it has several obnoxious bugs to boot. But that doesn’t mean
we can’t make it do more than balance an expense account. Along the way
we’ll examine the hardware, wire into its peripheral bus, figure out how
to exchange data with today’s future, create a simple game, draw
rudimentary graphics and (with some help) even put it on the Internet
with its very own Gopher client — after we tell of the WorkSlate’s brief
and sorrowful commercial existence, as this blog always must. ↫ Cameron

<h2 id="welcome-to-the-fight">Welcome to The Fight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Welcome to The Fight, I’m your punk rock climate journalist host Jael
Holzman. I’ve dedicated my entire career in journalism to understanding
how and why people oppose projects crucial to decarbonization. Now,
every week, I’ll be delivering must-read exclusive scoops and analysis
on the local battles and national trends shaping the future of climate
action as part of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus" target="_blank">Heatmap Plus</a>, a
new side of the site launching today that will go even deeper into the
projects, politics, and people shaping the energy transition.
</p>
<p>
As part of Heatmap Plus, you’ll get high-level analysis of our
proprietary polling and forecasting data, in-depth case studies
exploring why projects succeed or fail, exclusive interviews with
leading policymakers, developers, and activist groups, and my weekly
newsletter —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/plus/the-fight" target="_blank">The
Fight</a> — that will offer a comprehensive weekly snapshot of the
battles being waged over renewable energy projects across the country,
plus a lot of original reporting.
</p>
<p>
A little bit about me: For years, I reported on the transition by
writing about <em><em>mining </em></em>– one of the dirtiest businesses
central to renewable energy, vehicle electrification, and industrial
decarbonization. As I covered those topics, it was evident that climate
activists, policymakers, and investors alike were all quietly torn up by
the reality that building things meant some pretty shocking knock-on
effects for the environment and society. I also found the threat of
those consequences became a useful tool for shaping public opinion
against the energy transition, a practice best described as “trade-off
denial.”
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, I joined Heatmap after being approached with an
opportunity: how would I like to investigate conflicts over individual
renewables and battery projects in places where a hollowed-out local
media left no reporters available to ask the tough questions? On top of
that, I’d get to take a wide-angle lens, sussing out what national
policy trends, forces, and industries were driving opposition and the
hurdles to projects getting built. I could give Heatmap readers all the
information they’d need, project by project, accompanied by exclusive
data and regular Q&amp;A sessions with readers.
</p>
<p>
So after months of investigating various projects and their opponents,
I’m excited to debut the first edition of The Fight. I’ve got to tell
you, these stories might bother you. In our inaugural send, for example,
you’ll hear about how a fight against a California battery storage
project might impact permitting nationwide, the ways a few activists can
manipulate emotional fears to create real roadblocks to construction,
and the wide gulf between what regulators and developers want versus the
individuals most likely to sue to stop a project.
</p>
<p>
This won’t always be fun — in fact, sometimes it might be a bummer. But
over the span of this newsletter, by talking to all sides involved and
providing an airing of grievances, it’s my hope we’ll use
well-intentioned journalism to inform you on how the things we need to
ditch fossil fuels can be built faster and get community buy-in.
</p>
<p>
This newsletter will go out exclusively to subscribers of Heatmap Plus.
If you want to get it,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/st/Landing_Subscription" target="_blank">you
can join Plus

<h2 id="blinken-heads-to-haiti-dominican-republic-this-week">Blinken
heads to Haiti, Dominican Republic this week</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is
traveling to Haiti and the Dominican Republic on Thursday, marking his
first visits to both Caribbean nations as the top U.S. diplomat.</p>
<p>Blinken’s visit to Port-au-Prince underscores U.S. support for Haiti,
with additional humanitarian assistance anticipated as the country
grapples with gang violence. His trip to Santo Domingo follows the start
of Dominican Republic President Luis Abinader’s second term in
mid-August.</p>
<p>A senior State Department official told reporters on Wednesday that
the United States is prioritizing efforts with its international
partners to set up a structure that ensures “a reliable source of
financing and staffing” for a security mission in Haiti.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is reportedly considering
the possibility of transitioning a largely U.S.-funded multinational
security force into a traditional United Nations peacekeeping
operation.</p>
<p>“A formal PKO (peacekeeping operation) is one of the ways that we
could accomplish that, but we’re looking at multiple ways to do that,”
said Brian Nichols, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere
affairs.</p>
<p>With about a month left in the mandate of the U.N.-ratified,
Kenya-led Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in Haiti,
progress has been limited, and many pledges remain unfulfilled.</p>
<p>“The one-year anniversary of the mission is October 2, and we’re
going to work to ensure that it’s poised for success and renewal of its
mandate in whatever form that takes,” Nichols told VOA on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Multinational security support</p>
<p>Gang-related violence and drug trafficking have fueled political
instability and insecurity in Haiti, leading to an unbearable living
situation for the Haitian people.</p>
<p>In October 2022, Haiti requested the deployment of an international
force to assist the Haitian National Police in combating heavily armed
gangs and facilitating humanitarian aid. In October 2023, the United
Nations Security Council authorized the MSS.</p>
<p>The United States and Canada are the top funders of the MSS in Haiti.
The estimated first-year cost for the mission is $589 million. The U.S.
has already provided $309 million — $200 million toward the MSS mission
base and $109 million in financial support.</p>
<p>During a visit to Haiti in July, U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield announced an additional $60 million in
humanitarian assistance for the Haitian people, along with providing
armored vehicles for the national police.</p>
<p>While in Haiti, Blinken will review the progress made toward
improving security and encourage efforts to appoint the provisional
electoral council so Haiti can move toward elections, according to the
State Department.</p>
<p>Blinken will hold talks with Edgard Leblanc Fils, president of
Haiti’s Transitional Presidential Council, and Haitian Prime Minister
Garry Conille. Blinken also will meet with MSS head Godfrey Otunge and
Normil Rameau, head of the Haitian National Police.</p>
<p>At least 80% of Port-au-Prince is no longer under the control of the
Haitian authorities, with violence spreading to other parts of the
country.</p>
<p>In the past year, displacement in Haiti has tripled as gang violence
grips the Caribbean nation. The United Nations reports that at least
578,000 people have been displaced due to violence, including murders,
kidnappings and rapes.</p>
<p>The situation is further exacerbated by widespread hunger, with
nearly half of the 11.7 million population facing acute food
insecurity.</p>
<p>Gangs, some aligned with political elites, accumulated their control
over territory and illicit markets during the tenure of the deeply
unpopular former Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who took office after the
assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021, according to a
Congressional Research Service report. Henry resigned in April 2024
following the formation of a Transitional Presidential Council.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic will host the 2025 Summit of the Americas,
where Western Hemisphere leaders will address shared challenges and
policy issues facing the region.</p>
<p>“In the Dominican Republic, we will reinforce our shared priorities
such as promoting democratic governance, supporting free and fair
elections in the region, and fighting corruption,” Nichols told
reporters.</p>
<p>On August 16, President Luis Abinader was inaugurated for a second
four-year term. He has vowed to boost security by training more police
over the next four years. His administration has barred migrants from
neighboring Haiti.</p>
<p>“We certainly hope to see more normal relations between the Dominican
Republic and Haiti,” Nichols said. “The countries are inexorably linked,
and we certainly will have those conversations with leaders on both
sides of the border.”</p>
<p>The U.S. and the Dominican Republic signed a historic Open Skies
agreement on August 2. Once in effect, the agreement will expand
opportunities for airlines, travel companies and people-to-people
exchanges. More than 4 million U.S. citizens visit the Dominican
Republic each year.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic is a crucial partner for the U.S. in
hemispheric affairs, due to its position as the second-largest economy
in the Caribbean, after Cuba, and the third-largest country by
population, behind Cuba and Haiti. The U.S. is its primary trading
partner.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Dominican Republic is home to Pueblo Viejo, one of
the world’s largest gold mines, and serves as a major global supplier of
ferronickel.</p>
<p>The United States said it will continue robust collaboration with the
Dominican Republic to advance inclusive economic growth, bolster
democratic institutions, uphold human rights, and enhance governance and
security.</p>
<p>The Dominican Republic and the United States, along with five Central
American countries, are parties to the Dominican Republic-Central
America Free Trade Agreement, known as CAFTA-DR. This agreement enhances
economic opportunities by eliminating tariffs, opening markets, reducing
barriers to services and promoting transparency.</p>
<p>The U.S. Agency for International Development is investing more than
$9.5 million to strengthen the Dominican Republic’s existing justice
system and to reduce crime and violence.</p>

id="us-sending-pentagon-rep-to-chinas-top-security-forum-this-month">US
sending Pentagon rep to China’s top security forum this month</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — The United States is planning to send Michael Chase, the
deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia, to
China’s top annual security forum this month, two U.S. defense officials
have confirmed to VOA.</p>
<p>One of the officials, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity
ahead of the forum, called Chase’s upcoming attendance “consistent
participation from the U.S.” </p>
<p>Chase is more senior than the U.S. representative at last year’s
Xiangshan Forum, but his rank is on par with historical norms for
Pentagon representatives who attend the annual meeting. The Pentagon did
not send a representative from 2020-2022 due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>“This engagement is meant to be more of the same” to keep the lines
of military communication open and ensure that China has a clear
understanding of the United States’ position on global security issues,
the defense official told VOA. </p>
<p>The forum comes on the heels of a face-to-face meeting in Singapore
between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart,
Admiral Dong Jun, in late May.</p>
<p>Austin spoke with Dong for the first time in April, marking the first
dialogue between the two countries’ defense chiefs in nearly 17 months.
The top U.S. military officer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Gen. C.Q. Brown, spoke with his Chinese military counterpart in
December.</p>
<p>“Of course talks can make a difference. Having those mil-to-mil
communications, those senior channels open, actually allows for the
avoidance of a miscalculation,” Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina
Singh told reporters earlier this year.</p>
<p>Chinese state media reports say that more than 90 countries and
international organizations plan to send delegations to Beijing for the
September 12-14 forum.</p>
<p>Reuters was first to report the decision.</p>
<p>Beijing has asserted its desire to control access to the South China
Sea and bring democratically ruled Taiwan under its control, by force if
necessary. President Joe Biden has said U.S. troops would defend the
island from attack.</p>
<p>China’s defense ministry has said the Taiwan issue is the “core of
China’s core interests.”</p>
<p>Tensions have risen sharply between China and U.S. ally the
Philippines in the South China Sea, with China’s coast guard using water
cannons to threaten Filipino fishing ships. China has also used
collision and ramming tactics, undersea barriers and a military-grade
laser to stop Philippine resupply and patrol missions.</p>
<p>Last year, Austin and his Philippine counterpart established the
U.S.-Philippines Bilateral Defense Guidelines, which reaffirmed that an
armed attack in the Pacific – including anywhere in the South China Sea
– on either of their public vessels, aircraft, or armed forces, would
invoke mutual defense commitments outlined in the 1951 U.S.-Philippines
Mutual Defense Treaty.</p>

id="empty-capsule-to-return-to-earth-soon-2-astronauts-will-stay-behind">Empty
capsule to return to Earth soon; 2 astronauts will stay behind</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — Boeing will attempt to return its
problem-plagued capsule from the International Space Station later this
week — with empty seats.</p>
<p>NASA said Wednesday that everything is on track for the Starliner
capsule to undock from the space station Friday evening. The fully
automated capsule will aim for a touchdown in New Mexico’s White Sands
Missile Range six hours later.</p>
<p>NASA’s two stuck astronauts, who flew up on Starliner, will remain
behind at the orbiting lab. They’ll ride home with SpaceX in February,
eight months after launching on what should have been a weeklong test
flight. Thruster trouble and helium leaks kept delaying their return
until NASA decided that it was too risky for them to accompany Starliner
back as originally planned.</p>
<p>“It’s been a journey to get here, and we’re excited to have Starliner
return,” said NASA’s commercial crew program manager Steve Stich.</p>
<p>NASA’s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will close the hatches between
Starliner and the space station on Thursday. They are now considered
full-time station crew members along with the seven others on board,
helping with experiments and maintenance, and ramping up their exercise
to keep their bones and muscles strong during their prolonged exposure
to weightlessness.</p>
<p>To make room for them on SpaceX’s next taxi flight, the Dragon
capsule will launch with two astronauts instead of the usual four. Two
were cut late last week from the six-month expedition, which is due to
blast off in late September. Boeing must vacate the parking place for
SpaceX’s arrival.</p>
<p>Boeing encountered serious flaws with Starliner long before its June
5 liftoff on the long-delayed astronaut demo.</p>
<p>Starliner’s first test flight went so poorly in 2019 — the capsule
never reached the space station because of software errors — that the
mission was repeated three years later. More problems surfaced,
resulting in even more delays and more than $1 billion in repairs.</p>
<p>The capsule had suffered multiple thruster failures and
propulsion-system helium leaks by the time it pulled up at the space
station after launch. Boeing conducted extensive thruster tests in space
and on the ground, and contended the capsule could safely bring the
astronauts back. But NASA disagreed, setting the complex ride swap in
motion.</p>
<p>Starliner will make a faster, simpler getaway than planned, using
springs to push away from the space station and then short thruster
firings to gradually increase the distance. The original plan called for
an hour of dallying near the station, mostly for picture-taking; that
was cut to 20 or so minutes to reduce the stress on the capsule’s
thrusters and keep the station safe.</p>
<p>Additional test firings of Starliner’s 28 thrusters are planned
before the all-important descent from orbit. Engineers want to learn as
much as they can since the thrusters won’t return to Earth; the section
containing them will be ditched before the capsule reenters.</p>
<p>The stuck astronauts — retired Navy captains — have lived on the
space station before and settled in just fine, according to NASA
officials. Even though their mission focus has changed, “they’re just as
dedicated for the success of human spaceflight going forward,” flight
director Anthony Vareha said.</p>
<p>Their blue Boeing spacesuits will return with the capsule, along with
some old station equipment.</p>
<p>NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX a decade ago to ferry its astronauts to
and from the space station after its shuttles retired. SpaceX
accomplished the feat in 2020 and has since launched nine crews for NASA
and four for private customers.</p>

id="shot-killed-at-high-school-in-us-state-of-georgia-student-in-custody">4
shot, killed at high school in US state of Georgia; student in
custody</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WINDER, Georgia — A 14-year-old student opened fire at a high school
in the U.S. state of Georgia, killing four people on Wednesday,
authorities said. The shooting sent students scrambling for shelter in
their classrooms — and eventually to the football stadium — as officers
swarmed the campus and parents raced to find out if their children were
safe.</p>
<p>The dead were identified as two students and two teachers at
Apalachee High School in Winder, about an hour’s drive from Atlanta. At
least nine other people with injuries were taken to hospitals.</p>
<p>Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Chris Hosey said two school
resource officers encountered the shooter within minutes after a report
of shots fired. The suspect, a student at the school, immediately
surrendered and was taken into custody. He is being charged as an adult
with murder.</p>
<p>Authorities were still looking into how the suspect obtained the gun
used in the shooting and how he got it into the school.</p>
<p>The investigation was still “very active,” Hosey said, with lots of
interviews and crime scene work yet to be done.</p>
<p>Barrow County Sheriff Jud Smith choked up as he began to speak during
the news conference. He said he was born and raised in the community and
his kids are in the school system.</p>
<p>“My heart hurts for these kids. My heart hurts for our community,” he
said. “But I want to make it very clear that hate will not prevail in
this county. I want that to be very clear and known. Love will prevail
over what happened today.”</p>
<p>Schools closed rest of week</p>
<p>Superintendent Dallas LeDuff said county schools will be closed for
the rest of the week as they cooperate with the investigation, but grief
counseling will be available.</p>
<p>The school shooting was just the latest among dozens across the
United States in recent years, including especially deadly ones in
Newtown, Connecticut; Parkland, Florida; and Uvalde, Texas. The
classroom killings have set off fervent debates about gun control and
frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to
active shooter drills in classrooms. But they have done little to move
the needle on national gun laws.</p>
<p>Jacob King, a sophomore football player, said he had dozed off in his
world history class after a morning practice when he heard about 10
gunshots.</p>
<p>King said he didn’t believe the shooting was real until he heard an
officer yelling at someone to put down their gun. King said when his
class was led out, he saw officers shielding what appeared to be an
injured student.</p>
<p>Before Wednesday’s shooting, there had been 29 mass killings in the
U.S. so far this year, according to a database maintained by The
Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern
University. At least 127 people have died in those killings, which are
defined as incidents in which four or more people die within a 24-hour
period, not including the killer — the same definition used by the
FBI.</p>
<p>Last year ended with 217 deaths from 42 mass killings in the U.S.,
making 2023 one of the deadliest years on record for such shootings in
the country.</p>
<p>Ashley Enoh was at home Wednesday morning when she got a text from
her brother, who’s a senior at Apalachee High.</p>
<p>“Just so you know, I love you,” he texted her.</p>
<p>Students, teachers create barricades</p>
<p>Sophomore Kaylee Abner was in geometry class when she heard gunshots.
She and her classmates ducked behind their teacher’s desk, and then the
teacher began flipping the desk in an attempt to barricade the classroom
door, Abner said. A classmate beside her was praying, and she held his
hand while the students waited for the police.</p>
<p>Layla Ferrell, a junior, was in a health class when the words “hard
lockdown” appeared on a screen in the classroom and lights began
flashing. Ferrell said she and her frightened classmates piled desks and
chairs in front of the door to create a barricade.</p>
<p>Helicopter video from WSB-TV showed dozens of law enforcement and
emergency vehicles surrounding the school in Barrow County, about 80
kilometers northeast of Atlanta.</p>
<p>When Erin Clark, 42, received a text from her son Ethan, a senior at
the high school, that there was an active shooter, she rushed from her
job at the Amazon warehouse to the school. The two texted “I love you,”
and Clark said she prayed for her son as she drove to the high
school.</p>
<p>With the main road to the school blocked, Clark parked and ran with
other parents, who were then directed to the football field. Amid the
chaos, Clark found Ethan sitting on the bleachers.</p>
<p>Clark said her son was writing an essay in class when he first heard
the gunshots. Her son then worked with his classmates to barricade the
door and hide.</p>
<p>“I’m so proud of him for doing that,” she said. “He was so
brave.”</p>
<p>Students had only started the school year a little over a month
ago.</p>
<p>“It makes me scared to send him back,” she said. “I don’t know what
I’m going to do.”</p>
<p>Traffic going to the school was backed up for more than 1 kilometer
as parents tried to get to their children.</p>
<p>“It’s just outrageous that every day, in our country, in the United
States of America, that parents have to send their children to school
worried about whether or not their child will come home alive,” Vice
President Kamala Harris said during a campaign stop in New
Hampshire.</p>
<p>In a message posted to social media, former President Donald Trump
said, “These cherished children were taken from us far too soon by a
sick and deranged monster.”</p>
<p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said in a statement, “This is a day every
parent dreads, and Georgians everywhere will hug their children tighter
this evening because of this painful event.”</p>
<p>The FBI’s Atlanta office said its agents were at the school
“coordinating with and supporting local law enforcement.”</p>
<p>Apalachee High School has about 1,900 students, according to records
from Georgia education officials. It became Barrow County’s
second-largest public high school when it opened in 2000, according to
the Barrow County School System. It’s named after the Apalachee River on
the southern edge of Barrow County.</p>
<p>The shooting had reverberations in Atlanta, where patrols of schools
in that city were beefed up, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said.</p>
<p>In Winder, Abner said that when she goes home Wednesday night, she
hopes to avoid thinking about those terrifying moments in her geometry
class.</p>
<p>“I’ll probably not think about it, even though it happened,” she
said. “Just think happy thoughts, don’t think about it anymore.”</p>
<p>Sophomore Shantal Sanvee, who was in a classroom near the gunshots,
said “she saw ’a whole lot of blood. And it was just, it was just
horrible.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I want to be here for like a long time now,” she
added.</p>
<p>As an officer led the students toward the football stadium, freshman
Michelle Moncada was in tears. People who she knew had been shot.</p>
<p>“I was just really, really nervous,” Moncada said.</p>
<p>The stadium was filled with tear-stricken students wondering whether
their friends were OK. She saw one of her friends on the floor. A bullet
had grazed him.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t feel real,”she said.</p>

IRA Program Spawned 50,000 Solar Projects In Low-Income Communities. Who

<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU4Mzg2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1Nzk4ODE0M30.NAohgdE40eyTyDBF2n59-rF7HaMQE1Clcqkr7fWxnZc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
By the numbers, a new federal program designed to give low-income
communities access to renewable energy looks like a smashing success.
According to data provided exclusively to Heatmap, in its first year,
the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program steered nearly 50,000
solar projects to low-income communities and tribal lands, which are
together expected to produce more than $270 million in annual energy
savings.
</p>
<p>
But those topline numbers don’t say anything about who will actually see
the savings, or how much the projects will benefit households that have
historically been left behind. In reality, the majority of the projects
— about 98% — were allocated funding simply for being located in
low-income communities, with no hard requirement to deliver energy or
financial savings to low-income residents.
</p>
<p>
A closer look at the data reveals a more complicated success story.
While the program did make some clear strides in bridging the solar
inequality gap, other factors — including the language in the law that
created it — are also holding it back.
</p>
<p>
The Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program came out of the
Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022. Though the goal is to increase
solar access for low-income households, it’s not actually a tax credit
<em><em>for</em></em> low income households. It’s for small wind and
solar developers — and beginning in 2025, developers of other types of
clean energy — whose projects meet certain criteria.
</p>
<p>
The law caps the total amount of energy the program can support at 1.8
gigawatts per year, and developers have to apply and get their project
approved in order to claim funds. To be eligible, a project must produce
less than 5 megawatts of power and fall under one of four categories: It
must be located in a
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?def_id=26-USC-1923830901-332395025" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>low-income
community</u></a>, be built on Indian land, be part of an affordable
housing development, or distribute at least half its power (and
guaranteed bill savings) to low-income households. The first two
categories qualify for a 10% credit; the second two, which stipulate
that at least some financial benefits go to low-income residents,
qualify for 20%. In both cases, the credit can be stacked on top of the
baseline 30% tax credit for clean energy projects
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ira-anniversary-labor" target="_self"><u>that
meet labor standards</u></a>, meaning it could slash the cost of
building a small solar or wind farm in half.
</p>
<p>
Each of these provisions has the potential to address at least some of
the barriers disadvantaged communities face in accessing clean energy.
Low-income homeowners may not have the money for a down payment for
rooftop solar or the credit to find financing, for instance. But by
giving developers a tax credit for projects located in low-income
communities, solar leasing programs, in which homeowners lease panels
from a third party in exchange for energy bill savings, now have an
incentive to expand into these neighborhoods, and potentially offer
lower lease rates. The program helped fund nearly 48,000 residential
solar projects in the first year.
</p>
<p>
Tribal lands, meanwhile, account for more than 5% of solar generation
potential in the U.S., but are still a
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/86047.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>largely
untapped resource</u></a>, for reasons including lack of representation
in utility regulatory processes, complex land ownership structures, and
limited tribal staff capacity. The program gives outside developers
additional incentive to work through the challenges, and it also
earmarks funds for tribe-owned development. Crucially, the IRA also
opened the door for tribes, as well as other tax-exempt entities, to
utilize clean energy incentives and receive a direct payment equal to
the tax credits. The program supported 96 solar projects on tribal lands
in the first year.
</p>
<p>
The third category attempts to overcome the famous “split incentive”
problem for low-income renters whose landlords have little reason to
spend money on a solar project that primarily benefits tenants. The
program helped finance 805 solar projects on low-income residential
buildings, where the developers are required to distribute at least 50%
of the energy savings equitably among tenants.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, while renters in some states can subscribe to community solar
projects, which offer utility bill credits in exchange for a small
subscription fee, the subscriptions can be scooped up by wealthier
customers if there’s no low-income requirement. The program sponsored
319 community solar projects where at least half the capacity had to go
to low-income residents and offer at least 20% off their bills.
</p>
<p>
U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo declared the program
a success. “These investments are already lowering costs, protecting
families from energy price spikes, and creating new opportunities in our
clean energy future,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Despite
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1945" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overwhelming
demand during the four-month application period</u></a>, however, the
program ended up with capacity to spare. Although applications totaled
more than 7 gigawatts, ultimately, the Department approved just over
49,000 projects equal to about 1.4 gigawatts, or roughly enough to power
200,000 average households. All of it was solar.
</p>
<p>
The gap between applications and awarded projects has to do with the
program’s design. The Treasury divided the 1.8 gigawatt cap between the
four categories, setting maximum amounts that could be awarded for each
one. Within the four categories, the awards were further divided, with
half set aside for applicants that met additional ownership or
geographic criteria, such as tribal-owned companies, tax-exempt
entities, or projects sited in areas with especially high energy costs
relative to incomes.
</p>
<p>
For example, 200 megawatts were earmarked for Indian lands, with half
reserved for applicants meeting those additional criteria, but only 40
megawatts were awarded. The fourth category, meanwhile, which was
designed to encourage community solar development, was oversubscribed.
</p>
<p>
Since tax data is confidential, the Treasury Department could not share
much detail about these projects, including where, exactly, they were,
who developed them, or who will benefit from them. A map overview shows
a concentration of awards across the sunbelt, with Illinois, New York,
Maine, Massachusetts, and Puerto Rico also seeing a lot of uptake.

</p>
<p>
I reached out to more than a dozen nonprofits, tribal organizations, and
other groups who advocate for or develop clean energy projects
benefiting low-income communities to find examples of what the program
was actually funding. The first person I was connected with was Richard
Best, the director of capital projects and planning for Seattle Public
Schools, who got a 10% tax credit for solar arrays on two new schools
under construction in low-income neighborhoods. While the school system
already planned to put solar on these schools, Best said the tax credits
helped offset increased construction costs due to supply chain
interruptions, preventing them from having to make compromises on design
elements like classroom size.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not insignificant,” he told me. “The solar array at Rainier Beach
High School is in excess of a million dollars — just the rooftop solar
array. That’s $400,000 [in tax credits]. So these are significant
dollars that we’re receiving, and we’re very appreciative.”
</p>
<p>
Jody Lincoln, an affordable housing development officer for the
nonprofit ACTION-Housing in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, got a 10% tax
credit to add solar to a former YMCA that the group recently converted
to a 74-unit apartment building. The single room occupancy rental units
serve men who are coming out of homelessness or incarceration. Lincoln
told me the building operates “in the gray,” and that any cost saving
measures they can make, including the energy savings from the solar
array, enable it to continue to operate as affordable housing. When I
asked if they could have built the solar project without access to the
IRA’s tax credits, she didn’t hesitate: “No.”
</p>
<p>
These two examples show the program has potential to deliver benefits to
low-income communities, even in cases where the energy savings aren’t
going directly to low-income residents.
</p>
<p>
I also spoke with Alexandra Wyatt, the managing policy director and
counsel at the nonprofit solar company Grid Alternatives. She told me
Grid partnered with for-profit solar developers, such as the national
solar company SunRun, who were approved for the tax credit bonus for
rooftop solar lease projects on low-income single-family homes. In these
cases, Grid helped pull together other sources of funding like state
incentives for projects in disadvantaged communities to pre-pay the
leases so that the homeowners could more fully benefit from the energy
bill savings.
</p>
<p>
It’s unlikely that all of the nearly 48,000 residential rooftop solar
projects in low-income communities that were approved for the credit in
the first year had such virtuous outcomes. It’s also possible that
projects installed on wealthier homeowners’ roofs in gentrifying
neighborhoods were subsidized. In an email to me, a Treasury
spokesperson said the Department recognizes that “simply being in a
low-income community does not mean low-income households are being
served,” and that it was required by statute to include this category.
It was still the agency’s decision, however, to allocate such a large
portion of the awards, 700 megawatts, to this category — a decision that
some public comments on the program disagreed with.
</p>
<p>
Wyatt applauded the Treasury and the Department of Energy, which
oversees the application process, for doing “an admirable job on a tight
timeframe with a challenging program design handed to them by Congress.”
She’s especially frustrated by the 1.8 gigawatt cap, which none of the
other renewable energy tax credits have, and which changes it into a
competitive grant that’s more burdensome both for developers and for the
agencies. It adds an element of uncertainty to project finance, she
said, since developers have to wait to see if their application for the
credit was approved.

relations at the Alliance for Tribal Clean Energy told me there was tons
of interest among indigenous communities and tribal clean energy
developers in taking advantage of the IRA programs, but it wasn’t really
happening. Holland cited challenges for tribes reaching the stage of
“commercial readiness” required to apply for federal funding. Tribal
developers have also said they are
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/climate-law-boost-for-renewables-hits-barrier-on-tribal-lands/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>limited
by the lack of transmission on tribal lands</u></a>. When I asked the
Treasury about the paltry number of projects on Indian Lands, a
spokesperson said it was not for lack of trying. The Department and
other federal agencies have conducted webinars and other forms of
outreach, they said, through which they’ve heard that many tribes are
struggling to access capital for energy projects, and that development
on Indian lands has “unique challenges due to the history of allotment
of Indian lands and status of some land as federal trust land.”
</p>
<p>
Holland is optimistic that things will change — in December, Biden
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/12/06/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-historic-executive-order-to-usher-in-the-next-era-of-tribal-self-determination/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>issued
an executive order</u></a> committing to making it easier for tribes to
access federal funding. The Alliance also recently
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/ATCE-petition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>petitioned
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</u></a> to address barriers for
tribal energy development in its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ferc-transmission-planning-rule" target="_self"><u>new
rules that are supposed to get more transmission built</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The unallocated capacity from 2023 was carried over to the next year’s
round of funding, so it wasn’t lost. But a
<a href="https://eco.energy.gov/ejbonus/s/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dashboard</u></a>
tracking the second year of the program looks like it’s following a
similar pattern. While the community solar-oriented category, which was
increased to allow for 900 megawatts, is nearly filled up, the tribal
Lands category, which kept its 200 megawatt cap, has received
applications to develop less than a sixth of that.
</p>
<p>
Wyatt said that so far, she does think the bonus credit has been
successful in spurring good projects that might not otherwise have
happened. Still, it will probably take a few years before it will be
possible to assess how well it’s working. The good news is, as long as
it doesn’t get repealed, the program could run for up to eight more
years, leaving plenty of time to improve things. It’s already set to
change in one key way. Beginning in 2025, it
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2552" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>becomes
tech-neutral</u></a>, meaning that developers of small hydroelectric,
geothermal heating or power, or nuclear projects, will be able to apply.
(When asked why no wind projects were approved to date, a spokesperson
for the Treasury said taxpayer privacy rules meant it couldn’t comment
on applications, but they added that wind projects tend to be larger
than 5 megawatts and take longer to develop.)
</p>
<p>
One thing is for sure, despite the heavy administrative burden of
screening tens of thousands of applications, the agencies involved are
clearly committed to implementing the program.
</p>
<p>
“I’m definitely pleased that they managed to get the program up and
running as quickly as they did,” Wyatt told me. “I mean, it’s kind of
lightning speed for the IRS.”

<h2 id="a-battery-backlash-goes-to-washington">A Battery Backlash Goes
to Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
One hour north of Los Angeles, the small town of Acton is experiencing a
battery energy storage buildout — and quickly becoming the must-watch
frontline in the backlash against lithium-ion energy storage systems.
The flashpoint: wildfires.
</p>
<p>
Like many parts of California, Acton has hot summers with heavy winds,
putting it at
<a href="https://firststreet.org/city/acton-ca/600212_fsid/fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>elevated
risk</u></a> of
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/park-fire-paradise-california-chico/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
kind blaze</u></a> that makes national headlines. Battery storage fires,
while rare, are a unique threat, with relatively little data available
about them to help regulators or the public understand the risk. People
in Acton wondered: Would they really be safe if a wildfire engulfed a
battery storage site, or if a battery failure sparked a new
conflagration?
</p>
<p>
When L.A. County blessed the first battery energy storage system project
in Acton last year, developers and local fire officials said they were
doing everything in their power to ensure the batteries would meet
safety standards. Residents were far from convinced.
</p>
<p>
“This will turn our community into industrial hell and it’ll erase us
from the face of the Earth,” Jacqueline Ayer, a member of Acton’s town
council, told me. Ayer is helping lead the local fight against the
projects.
</p>
<p>
I’ve now spent more than a month researching the fight in Acton. In the
process, I’ve learned how much — or little — we know about when battery
energy storage and wildfires mix. We’ll get to that later in this story.
To be honest, debunking battery fire risk wasn’t why I spent a month on
Acton. It was what happened when the fears took hold.
</p>
<p>
Feeling they’d been failed by both the regulatory approval process and
the court system, the Acton project’s opponents turned to their
representative in Washington, House Republican
<a href="https://x.com/RepMikeGarcia/status/1792655225410498871" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mike
Garcia</u></a>. Though Garcia can’t do anything to stop this particular
project, he can severely hinder future ones: As Heatmap can exclusively
report, after lobbying from Acton, Garcia inserted language into the
annual funding bill for the Department of Energy that would block it
from implementing a new rule designed to expedite permits for federally
funded battery projects.
</p>
<p>
“What we’re hoping is that [with Garcia] being at the federal level,
he’ll shed some light to the people at the top,” said Ruthie Brock of
the activist group Acton Takes Action, “because if the top becomes
informed, it’ll trickle down to local governments.”
</p>
<p>
This is why the Acton fight is so important — it demonstrates the risk
of failing to obtain community buy-in, which can ricochet in ways no one
intended. The political and media environments are quick to
sensationalize the downsides of renewable energy, creating a tinderbox
atmosphere in which small local fights can quickly become national ones.
</p>
<h2>
Fearing a known unknown
</h2>
<p>
On some level, a fight over battery fires going national was inevitable.
Across the country, from New York to Washington state, communities are
revolting against battery energy storage sites coming to their
backyards. Often, those opposed cite the feared threat of fires or
explosions.
</p>
<p>
Fires in battery energy storage systems, a.k.a. BESS, are quite rare.
According to what
<a href="https://storagewiki.epri.com/index.php/BESS_Failure_Incident_Database#Stationary_Energy_Storage_Failure_Incidents" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data
is available</u></a>, the number of fires has stayed relatively flat
even as deployment has grown drastically. There were fewer than 10
failure events in the U.S. in 2023, and there have been even fewer so
far this year.
</p>
<p>
But when a fire does happen, experts say it can be quite difficult to
put out. In some cases, there’s nothing a community can do other than
let the blaze run.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a lack of consensus. There’s a lot of experts out there
providing guidance, and that’s something we’re trying to work on with
training throughout the country,” Victoria Hutchinson, an engineer with
the Fire Protection Research Foundation, told me. “[It’ll] instill some
fear in the meantime we figure out the best approach.”
</p>
<p>
Information on BESS and wildfires is even less available. Guillermo
Rein, a professor of fire science and the editor-in-chief of the journal
Fire Technology, told me the matter has not really been studied.
</p>
<p>
“When I say [BESS are] new, I mean <em><em>really</em></em> new,” Rein
said. “We hardly know how it works when it gets [on] fire and we don’t
have many technologies that are proven to work. We have technologies
that we wish will work, but proven technologies that work are very rare.
That means we have a new hazard we are struggling to understand and in
the meantime, we don’t know how to protect against it.”
</p>
<h2>
Parsing what happened in Acton
</h2>
<p>
Los Angeles County approved Acton’s first battery storage system —
Humidor, a 300 megawatt project by Hecate Energy — last summer through
an expedited “ministerial” process, the local equivalent of a
“categorical exclusion” under the National Environmental Policy Act.
Ministerial reviews and categorical exclusions are used by regulators to
skip the drawn out process of an environmental review because they can
reasonably predict a lack of significant impact. Joseph Horvath, a
spokesperson for L.A. County Planning, gave me a statement defending the
approval and stating BESS projects must meet all local and state zoning
and fire codes to receive a ministerial approval.
</p>
<p>
California had
<a href="https://signalscv.com/2021/02/acton-agua-dulce-named-as-sites-for-socal-edison-improvements-canyon-country-still-uncertain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>identified
the Acton community</u></a> back in 2021 as a potential site for energy
storage to protect against future power shut offs. Acton made sense
because it’s close to the SoCal Edison Vincent substation, making it
well positioned to connect to the grid. There was also a real sense of
urgency: To achieve its goal of 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045,
the state estimates it will need to install a projected 52,000 megawatts
or more of battery storage. Humidor is the first of what appears to be
multiple projects being planned for the area, including two more Hecate
facilities according to
<a href="https://hecategrid.com/our-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>materials
on</u></a> the
<a href="https://www.hecateenergy.com/projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>company’s
website</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Convinced that a battery boom could mix poorly with extreme fire risk,
and that the county moved far too fast to approve Humidor, Acton
residents sued. The county, they argued, had little reason to conclude
the facility would have an insignificant impact on the environment — so
few BESS projects have been approved that the county used the standards
from a different kind of project — an electrical substation — to draw
that conclusion. L.A. County Planning told me they chose this comparison
for reasons including the “purpose of BESS and its connection to the
larger network for distributive purposes.”
</p>
<p>
Rein told me that at least when it comes to the fire risk, this isn’t an
accurate comparison, and that there’s not actually enough data to claim
such a facility would have an insignificant impact. “I would put great
efforts into making sure this facility is safe,” he said. “They can’t
just say, <em><em>I met the regulation, I did enough. </em></em>Because
it’s a new hazard.”
</p>
<p>
Many of those in Acton opposed to the project believe the approval was
rushed, and claim that little information was made available to the
public as it was going through the county’s process. Furious residents
have told county planners that the Acton town council was not notified
in advance that an approval was on its way. They testified before the
county board of supervisors that Hecate held only a single public
meeting to discuss what it intended to build, with little notice given
to potentially concerned citizens.
</p>
<h2>
Obtaining a social license
</h2>
<p>
In my experience as a journalist reporting on large energy projects with
serious community impacts, transparency is key to getting local buy-in
to build a project. For years I covered the mining industry, where
innumerable decades of toxic waste spills and labor scandals have forced
companies to really innovate and spend serious dough on obtaining
“social license to operate,” a term developers and investors use to
describe acceptance to a company’s business practices.
</p>
<p>
This, of course, differs from the YIMBY school of thought that companies
and governments should eschew frustrated municipalities to pursue the
overriding net good of climate action. There are certainly merits to
this argument, especially when it comes to communities that won’t take
yes for an answer, and we’ll be exploring case studies supporting that
view in future editions of The Fight<em><em>. </em></em>
</p>
<p>
I’m on the fence about whether Acton is one of those cases, though.
Ayer, an environmental engineer by trade, told me she supports
decarbonization and wants to see climate action happen. She just wants
to feel assured the technology is safe.
</p>
<p>
If it wasn’t a lithium-ion battery storage facility “I would feel
comfortable,” she said. “We will shoulder some of the weight. But it
isn’t right that we shoulder all of the weight.”
</p>
<p>
When I tried to talk to Hecate about Acton’s wildfire concerns and how
the company had engaged with the community, a company spokesperson,
Bobby Howard, declined to make anyone available for an interview citing
“ongoing litigation related to the subject.” Howard provided a factbook
that said only that Humidor would “meet or exceed” local and state fire
codes — without specifying which codes — and detailed some of the
outreach the company did, including the public meeting as well as
mailers to “thousands of individuals throughout the greater Los Angeles
area, including civically engaged individuals throughout Acton.”
</p>
<p>
Howard declined to answer questions requesting more information about
the company’s public outreach and wildfire planning. He did tell the
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-05-14/acton-rural-serenity-proposed-battery-plants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Los
Angeles Times</em></em></u><u> earlier this year</u></a> that Humidor
would have “seismic bracing, safety zones around the perimeter,
substantial setbacks from parcel boundaries, gravel breaks and a masonry
wall around the facility.”
</p>
<p>
Stanford University senior research scholar and legal energy expert
Michael Wara explained to me that in cases like these, having buy-in
from the community is important to avoiding litigation and social
blowback. “That is losing,” Wara said. “You have not served your client
if you end up in litigation.”
</p>
<p>
“Having a process by which people are informed about a project and have
an opportunity to provide input is important for buy-in for all kinds of
projects related to the energy transition if you want to build in a
democratic society,” he said. “Is it really the <em><em>fire
risk</em></em> the community is concerned about?”
</p>
<h2>
Fire is the new whales
</h2>
<p>
When it comes to the Acton battery fight, it’s the fears of fire that
scare me the most, not the fire itself.
</p>
<p>
I sought reasons to be optimistic about putting battery energy storage
in areas like Acton that are prone to wildfire because, well, California
is essentially one big fire risk zone. James Campbell, a wildfire policy
expert at the Federation of American Scientists, told me that battery
energy storage decreases net wildfire risk compared to gas storage tanks
and pipelines. “If we consider the whole-climate trade-offs, battery
systems are much safer,” he said.
</p>
<p>
On its end, Hecate claimed in a letter to the L.A. County Board of
Supervisors that a BESS fire has never traveled off-site, and that
because the fires are fueled by flammable gasses, there is minimal risk
of embers traveling elsewhere and igniting grass or bushes. The company
pointed me to this letter when I reached out for comment.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing about fire risk mitigation is about certainty. It’s more, risk
mitigation and fire is kind of like wearing a seatbelt,” Wara told me.
“If you’re going 120 miles an hour down the highway and you get in a
high-speed collision, your seatbelt will not save you. [But] there’s
rapid advances in how these systems work.”
</p>
<p>
In the end, he added, meeting California’s carbon emissions targets will
“probably mean building somewhere that there is non-trivial wildfire
risk.”
</p>
<p>
What’s happening to offshore wind should be a cautionary tale for
developers considering whether sinking time and money into community
relations is really worth it: Last year, coastal fishermen and beach
town mayors in New Jersey joined forces with
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/inside-the-right-wing-conspiracy-to-thwart-the-clean-energy-transition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fossil
fuel funding and right-wing agitators</u></a> to foment a
conspiracy-infused campaign against offshore wind that has truly rattled
the future of the industry.
</p>
<p>
Part of that offshore wind backlash grew out of New Jersey Republicans
in Congress using the pulpit of their offices and filing amendments to
legislation. As Garcia takes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBK3Ug6oARc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>up
Acton’s cause</u></a>, I do wonder whether battery energy storage might
be next. November’s election makes it less likely his language hindering
expedited approvals for BESS projects will make it into the final
funding bill, and Garcia’s office did not respond to requests to discuss
its prospects.
</p>
<p>
But regardless, it’s an ember that could become a fire of its own.

<strong>1.</strong> <strong>York County, South Carolina
</strong>–<strong> </strong>Silfab Solar’s efforts<strong> </strong>to
build a solar panel factory in coastal South Carolina have become a
nexus of fear politics in recent weeks, even as the community’s
Republican congressman tries to assuage residents’ concerns.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Members of the community are concerned about chemicals that will be used
at the plant, which will be built near two schools. They also say
they’re worried about the risk of fires or explosions.
</li>

<strong>2. </strong><strong>Knox County, Nebraska </strong>–<strong>
</strong>North Fork Wind LLC last week joined with landowners to sue
Knox County in federal court over expansions to a stepback ordinance
that the company says were expressly designed to kill their 600-megawatt
wind farm.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Knox County changed a 2,000-foot stepback into a 6,600-foot one earlier
this year after
<a href="https://knoxcountyne.gov/pdfs/planning_zoning/Wind%20Watchers%20Proposed%20Amendments.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a

media pages for some “Wind Watchers” groups, I can tell you there’s a
lot of misinformation about wind and solar in their content feeds.
</li>
<li>
I’m watching ordinances and legal challenges like these closely. They’re
quickly becoming an easy way for projects to get gummed up in
administrative red tape over the concerns of fear-founded groups like
Wind Watchers.

<strong>3. </strong><strong>Madison County, Ohio </strong>–<strong>
</strong>What could be the largest agri-voltaics project in the U.S. may
be poised for a showdown in the Ohio Supreme Court.

Savion Energy’s 800-megawatt Oak Run solar project was re-approved by
the Ohio Power Siting Board last week after a lengthy battle with local
opposition.

projects based solely on whether there’s local dissent.
</li>
<li>
Agri-voltaics are crucial to the future of solar energy and present an
opportunity for sustainable renewable development on farmland. Keep an
eye out for a much longer dive into the opposition to Oak Run in next
week’s edition of The Fight.

<strong>4. </strong><strong>Nantucket County, Massachusetts</strong>
–<strong> </strong>If you thought the Vineyard Wind debacle would go
away, the fishermen want you to know you’re sadly mistaken.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The New England Fisherman’s Stewardship Association – a fishing trade

The U.S. will need many more offshore wind manufacturing sites to meet
its deployment goals. While no projects off California’s coast are
currently underway, building infrastructure at sites like Port San Luis
will be essential to building a state offshore wind industry.

<strong>China, China, China</strong> – Republicans in Congress are
trying to pressure the U.S. into an even more hawkish stance against
Chinese battery supply chains ahead of the November election.
</p>

The top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator

No matter the national security justifications, forcibly decoupling from
China would take essential supplies off the table for an energy
transition.

What I’m watching for is if the Republican pressure influences how
Kamala Harris approaches this topic, and whether she’ll differ from the
Biden administration’s approach to

<li>
No, what’s most notable is that the campaign official who made this news
was former Trump administration Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, who
is now a key figure at the MAGA-aligned America First Policy Institute.

<li>
I’ve covered Bernhardt for years and interviewed him last year upon the
release of his book, “You Report to Me.” It’s my belief he is angling
for an even more influential role in a future Trump administration that
would leverage his expertise in the administrative state to make Trump

Critics</h2>

<p>
<strong>Welcome to The Fight’s Q&amp;A section</strong> where we’ll
speak with the movers and shakers shaping every side of the debate over
renewable energy deployment.
</p>
<p>
Today our subject is Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director for the
Center for Biological Diversity, an environmentalist organization at
times on the plaintiff end of lawsuits against projects. I decided to
speak with him about how his organization’s opposition to some projects
squares with its support for rapid climate action.
</p>
<p>
The following is an abridged version of our conversation.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What would you say to someone who says the work you do is
delaying climate action? </strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s a huge amount of projects in the pipeline, and it’s not likely
that our level of intervention is going to materially affect the overall
rollout of clean energy.
</p>
<p>
We [the U.S.] aren’t picking the right projects to pursue. No plan
exists in the federal government for where that energy is going to come
from, where we’re going to pick which projects to permit. And we have no
filtering criteria for which to say, well, this is a good project and
there’s so many problems with this project that it’s a really bad
project and we shouldn’t permit.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why do you think the government isn’t engaging organizations
like CBD about which projects to pursue? </strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s not a legal obligation. It’s probably a moral obligation. If you’re
going to go to 50% EVs or whatever, you better have a plan for where all
the lithium is going to come from! There’s places with lower tribal
conflicts, these are knowable things. We can do it next week. We also
need to consolidate solar projects. There are millions of acres that
don’t have tortoises on them. We have more than enough land. I could
just pencil that out right now – it’s not that hard to find the least
conflicts. The data exists.
</p>
<p>
But again, industry’s been in the driver’s seat. Industry’s said, we
have this application and it needs to be processed because we brought it
in.
</p>
<p>
<strong>So what you’re saying is, you’d sit with
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-13-jigar-shah" target="_self"><u><strong>Jigar
Shah</strong></u></a><strong> and just plan it out? </strong>
</p>
<p>
If he asked me to come, I’d be in D.C. tomorrow. Absolutely. That’s what
we want — let’s plan it out, and then I can go work on other things,
y’know? I’d be happy to sue over that [other] stuff.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Absent this planning, which sounds nice but has not happened,
proponents of permitting reform often cite CBD’s repeated opposition as
a reason to pass legislation that could limit your ability to challenge
projects. What do you think about how your actions now could impact your
capacity to act in the future? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think some level of permitting reform was inevitable. I don’t think
anything in the permitting bill will cease our efforts. It will make it
harder for sure. I think the biggest thing it will do is eliminate the
ability for frontline communities to engage, so we’re looking at an
undemocratic clean energy transition where you have technocrats making
decisions for how people’s lives will play out. People in these rural
communities feel like they’re under assault. Low income desert folks
feel like their whole life is going to be turned upside down.

<h2 id="us-trade-deficit-widens-to-two-year-high-on-imports">US trade
deficit widens to two-year high on imports</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. trade deficit widened to the highest level in
more than two years in July as businesses likely front-loaded imports in
anticipation of higher tariffs on goods, suggesting trade could remain a
drag on economic growth in the third quarter.</p>
<p>While the surge in imports reported by the Commerce Department on
Wednesday would subtract from gross domestic product, it was an
indication of strong domestic demand and inconsistent with financial
market fears of a recession.</p>
<p>“The July trade data suggest that net trade will weigh on
third-quarter GDP growth, but that is hardly cause for concern when it
reflects the continued strength of imports, painting a better picture of
domestic demand than renewed recession fears would suggest,” said Thomas
Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p>The trade gap increased 7.9% to $78.8 billion, the widest since May
2022, the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said.</p>
<p>The government revised the trade data from January through June 2024
to incorporate more comprehensive and updated quarterly and monthly
figures.</p>
<p>Imports increased 2.1% to $345.4 billion. Goods imports rose 2.3% to
$278.2 billion, the highest since June 2022. They were boosted by an
increase in capital goods, which increased $3.3 billion to a record
high, mostly reflecting computer accessories.</p>
<p>Imports of industrial supplies and materials, which include
petroleum, increased $2.8 billion. There were also rises in imports of
nonmonetary gold-finished metal shapes.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration has announced plans to impose
steeper tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles, batteries,
solar products and other goods.</p>
<p>The government said last week a final determination will be made
public in the “coming days.” There are also fears of even higher tariffs
on Chinese imports should former President Donald Trump return to the
White House after the November 5 election.</p>
<p>The politically sensitive goods trade deficit with China increased
$4.9 billion to $27.2 billion. Exports to China fell $1.0 billion while
imports advanced $3.9 billion.</p>
<p>“Imports of goods from China increased, which shows how difficult it
will be to direct U.S. manufacturers away from their dependence on
lower-cost goods originating from China if that is what Congress and
political candidates wish to do,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief
economist at FWDBONDS.</p>
<p>Exports gained 0.5% to $266.6 billion. Goods exports climbed 0.4% to
$175.1 billion. Exports of motor vehicles, parts and engines decreased
$1.7 billion to the lowest since June 2022. Consumer goods exports fell
$800 million.</p>
<p>Exports of capital goods surged $1.8 billion to a record $56.1
billion, boosted by semiconductors.</p>
<p>The goods trade deficit increased 6.9% to $97.6 billion after
adjusting for inflation.</p>

id="apple-helped-nix-part-of-a-child-safety-bill.-more-fights-are-expected.">Apple
helped nix part of a child safety bill. More fights are expected.</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Kim Carver, a legislator in the US state of Louisiana, added a
provision to a child safety bill forcing Apple and Google to enforce age
restrictions on downloads in their application stores. In other words,
it would force Apple to make sure minors could not download gambling and
casino applications – i.e., 99% of mobile games – that make up the vast
majority of Apple’s services revenue. It would also make application
stores play a role in enforcing age restrictions on social media
applications, which makes sense because Apple and Google know the age of
every one of their users. Well, it turns out Apple was not happy. They
sent out an absolute army of lobbyists – including a guy known for
lobbying on behalf of truck-stop casinos, in case you were wondering
about the type of people Apple uses for lobbying – to kill this specific
provision. Carver’s provision would have breezed through the Louisiana
senate, but it needed a key committee approval before being put up for a
vote. And it’s this committee that Apple started heavily influencing and
pressuring. Carver began hearing rumblings that Apple was making inroads
with the committee—his amended bill might be in trouble. Uncertain on
how to proceed, he approached the chairwoman of the committee, Sen. Beth
Mizell, for advice. He declined to describe the substance of the
conversation to The Wall Street Journal, but in the end, he promised not
to object if she removed the app store provisions or support restoring
them on the Senate floor. “I made the choice to take the win that we
could get,” Carver said. ↫ Jeff Horwitz and Aaron Tilley at The Wall
Street Journal This is not the first time Apple has pressured
legislatures to drop bills it didn’t like. A famous case is the state if
Georgia, which intended to pass a number of application store bills to
open up the App Store in much the same way the European Union did with
the DMA. Apple went absolutely mental in Georgia, including threatening
to cancel “a $25 million investment in a historically Black college in
Atlanta”. Apple won. The way these sleazebag companies get away with
such blatant corruption is by using third-party lobbyists, which
technically are not employed by the companies in question, so no matter
how low and sleazy these lobbyists go, the companies they lobby for can
wash their hands in innocence and absolve themselves from any
responsibility for the various financial and legal threats levied at
underfunded, understaffed local legislatures. Spending a few millions on
a local development project or whatever is peanuts for Apple, but a
massive boon for a small community somewhere, so Apple pulling out means
nothing to Apple, but would massively affect such a community. It’s not
surprising local legislatures fold. Circling back to the age restriction
provision itself – telling stores what they can and cannot sell is an
entirely normal thing to do, and happens all the time all over the
world. It’s why in, say, The Netherlands, supermarkets are only allowed
to sell “light” alcohol like beer and wine, with hard alcohol moved to
separate liquor stores that have to be separate from the supermarket, so
age restrictions are easier to enforce. There’s also just an infinite
number of things you’re just not allowed to sell, period. As always,
Silicon Valley believes it’s a very special snowflake to whom regular,
normal, widely accepted rules do not apply. Why shouldn’t a store
selling gambling applications and similarly addictive and damaging
applications have to do the absolute bare minimum to protect minors?
Imagine the massive outcry if a Costco or Walmart was found to sell
massive amounts of hard liquor to children – why should Silicon Valley
companies be treated any differently?</p>

from the World Weather Attribution found human-caused climate change
made the devastating droughts taking place across Sicily and Sardinia
twice as likely. Both of the Italian islands are under a state of
emergency after a year of low rainfall and persistent heat triggered
some of the worst droughts on record. Due to water shortages, the
region’s farmers have been forced to sell or slaughter their livestock,
and harvests of wheat and olive crops are expected to fall by half.
While the region is used to hot and dry conditions, the WWA said this
drought is worsened by evapotranspiration, or the evaporation of water
from soil and plants. “Sardinia and Sicily are becoming increasingly
arid with climate change,” said Mariam Zachariah, a climate and
environment researcher at Imperial College London’s Grantham Institute.
“Searing, long lasting heat is hitting the islands more frequently,
evaporating water from soils, plants, and reservoirs.” WWA has linked
other recent extreme weather events to climate change, including

AI chipmaking company Nvidia lost $279 billion in market value
yesterday, and its shares kept falling in after-hours trading overnight.
Despite reports of an escalating Department of Justice antitrust probe,
the stock’s decline centers more on questions around the future of
artificial intelligence. We hear more. We also explore the shifting
geography of U.S. oil production and learn how gaps in USDA food

voices impatience with Taliban over morality law targeting Afghan
women</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Islamabad — An American diplomat has condemned the Taliban’s new
morality law in Afghanistan, warning that it “aims to complete the
erasure of women from public life.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rina Amiri, the United States special envoy for Afghan women, girls,
and human rights, posted on social media late Tuesday that she raised
concerns about the law during her recent meetings with counterparts in
Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“My message was clear:  Our support for the Afghan people remains
steadfast, but patience with the Taliban is running out,” Amiri wrote on
X, formerly known as Twitter. “The way to legitimacy domestically &amp;
internationally is respecting the rights of the Afghan people.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The U.S. warning comes days after the Taliban’s supreme leader,
Hibatullah Akhundzada, enacted the contentious decree that orders Afghan
women not to speak aloud in public and cover their bodies and faces
entirely when outdoors.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The 114-page, 35-article law also outlines various actions and
specific conduct that the Taliban government, called the Islamic
Emirate, considers mandatory or prohibited for Afghan men and women in
line with its strict interpretation of Islam.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The legal document empowers the Ministry for Promoting Virtue and
Preventing Vice, which the Taliban revived after coming back to power in
August 2021, to enforce it strictly.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Enforcers are empowered to discipline offenders, and penalties may
include anything from a verbal warning to fines to imprisonment. The law
requires them to prevent “evils” such as adultery, extramarital sex,
lesbianism, taking pictures of living objects and befriending
non-Muslims. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Official Taliban media quoted Akhundzada this week as ordering
authorities to “rigorously enforce” the new vice and virtue decree
across Afghanistan “to bring the people closer to the Islamic
system.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The law was enacted amid extensive restrictions on Afghan women’s
education and employment opportunities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since regaining power three years ago, the Taliban have prohibited
girls ages 12 and older from continuing their education beyond the sixth
grade and restricted women from seeking employment, except in certain
sectors such as health.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Afghan females are not allowed to visit parks and other public
places, and a male guardian must accompany them on road trips or air
travel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The United Nations promptly responded to the new law last month,
condemning it as a “distressing vision” for the impoverished country’s
future and urging de facto authorities to reverse it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Taliban government, which is officially not recognized by any
country, has dismissed U.N.-led foreign criticism as offensive.  </p>
<p> Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief Taliban spokesperson, asserted that
“non-Muslims should first educate themselves about Islamic laws and
respect Islamic values” before expressing concerns or rejecting the law.
“We find it blasphemous to our Islamic Sharia when objections are raised
without understanding it,” he said.</p>

You don’t need us to say it: The 2024 election will have enormous stakes

Aggarwal</u></a>, the chief executive officer of Energy Innovation, a
climate policy think tank that operates across North America, Europe,

climate policy, innovation, and deployment under President Joe Biden,
and she co-chaired the Biden administration’s Climate Innovation Working
Group. She and Jesse — another top-notch modeler — dive into what the
data can and can’t tell us about the election and how to think about
energy system models in the first place. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson
Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:<span></span>
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Sonia Aggarwal:</strong> It is very clear in the modeling that
there are certain policies that take us in the direction of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions, and other policies that take us in the
direction of increasing greenhouse gas emissions compared to where we
would be going otherwise.<br/> <br/>Now, as Jesse said, there can be all
kinds of things that happen that might change the specific numbers, but
we certainly can tell in the models that if you look at a policy — that
is, for example, a clean electricity standard — you’re going to see a
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions when you adopt that standard. And
that will happen against the background of lots of other things in the
economy, but we know that the effect of that particular policy is to
bring emissions down, and that’s very clear. So that’s one thing that we
can definitely tell with the models.<br/> <br/><strong>Jesse Jenkins:
</strong>Yeah. Maybe just one other point on this is that, what we had
in our mind when we started the REPEAT Project was a role similar to
what the Congressional Budget Office does to try to estimate the
financial and budgetary impacts of congressional decisions, right? You
know, Congress is making decisions all the time that affect revenues.
They’re going to spend more money. They’re going to raise more money
here and there. They’re going to lower taxes. They’re going to raise
taxes. They’re going to expand this program. And Congress legitimately
wants to have a sense of whether that’s going to increase or decrease
the deficit and, you know, whether that’s going to raise more money than
it spends or vice versa, and which programs have the biggest budgetary
cost.<br/><br/>And so every bill is scored on this budgetary front, over
a 10-year period in particular. And then, because they know it’s less
certain beyond that, they put less weight on the period beyond 10 years.
And I would bet every single one of those numbers is wrong, right? The
Congressional Budget Office probably misses every single one of those
numbers. But, they’re directionally correct, and they’re not wrong by
orders of magnitude.<br/> <br/>What they give Congress is the best
information they have at the time — during the fog of war and enactment
— to make a more informed decision about the financial implications of
their policies. And I think that’s how we should think about the
aggregate ensemble of models that have emerged to help us understand the
climate implications of these decisions, as
well.<br/><br/><strong>Aggarwal: </strong>Be careful when you ask
modelers questions about models, because you will
…<br/><br/><strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>No, but this is, I think,
the key question. Because I think there’s some degree to which these
models kind of do act in a way that’s very authoritative and very useful
to policymakers, right? I think that understanding them — just to be
clear, in line with how you presented them, but I think still really
important — as tools for decision-making under uncertainty and
authoritative, you know, biblical accounts of exactly what a policy will
do is the right way to understand, right?<br/> <br/>This is a tool for
thinking. It is a tool to bring into the rest of the thinking that you
would do about, in this case, what the climate impacts of the 2024
election are. But it doesn’t mean that you should use it to throw out
every other tool you have and every other piece of evidence we have,
however, given that all the pieces of evidence are pointing in the right
direction. I think it’s useful, in that regard, to get a sense of just
how catastrophic for the climate a Project 2025 could be. <br/>

Chips Act in the hope it would stimulate semiconductor manufacturing in
the bloc, semiconductor trade group the European Semiconductor Industry
Association (ESIA) has asked for more public money – and more say over
policy decisions impacting local chipmakers.…

the Convergent WorkSlate’s spreadsheet microcassette future</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: Old Vintage Computer Research</p>
<p>In this particular future, we will all use handheld spreadsheets
stored on microcassettes, talking to each other via speakerphone, and
probably listening to Devo and New Order a lot. (Though that part isn’t
too different from my <em>actual</em> present.)</p>

It’s been awhile since we’ve had an entry for reasons I’ll talk about
later, and this entry is a doozy. Since we recently just spent a couple
articles on <a href="/search/label/canon">a computer whose manufacturer
insisted it was mostly a word processor</a>, it only seems fitting to
spend some time with a computer whose very designer insisted it was
mostly a spreadsheet.
<p>
That’s the 1983 Convergent WorkSlate, a one-of-a-kind handheld system
from some misty alternate history where VisiCalc ruled the earth.
Indeed, even the “software” packages Convergent shipped for it — on
microcassette, which could store voice memos and data — were nothing
more than cells and formulas in a worksheet. The built-in modem let you
exchange data with other Workslates (or even speak over the phone to
their users), and it came with a calculator desk accessory and a
rudimentary terminal program, but apart from those creature comforts its
built-in spreadsheet was the sole centre of your universe. And, unlike
IAI and the
<a href="/2024/07/pretty-pictures-bootable-floppy-disks.html">Canon
Cat</a>, I’ve yet to find any backdoor (secret or otherwise) to enable
anything else.
<p>
<p>That means anything <em>you</em> want to program has to be somehow
encoded in a spreadsheet too. Unfortunately, when it comes to actually
programming the device it turns out the worst thing a spreadsheet on an
8-bit CPU can be is Turing-complete (so it’s not), and it has several
obnoxious bugs to boot. But that doesn’t mean we can’t make it do more
than balance an expense account. Along the way we’ll examine the
hardware, wire into its peripheral bus, figure out how to exchange data
with <em>today’s</em> future, create a simple game, draw rudimentary
graphics and (with some help) even put it on the Internet with its very
own Gopher client — after we tell of the WorkSlate’s brief and sorrowful
commercial existence, as this blog always must.</p>

Convergent Technologies was founded in 1979 in Santa Clara, California
by former employees of Intel and Xerox PARC, led by the flamboyant
cigar-chomping Allen H. Michels as president and co-founder. Unusually
for the time, Convergent’s plan was to be a behind-the-scenes designer
and manufacturer, at least initially selling little under its own brand.
Instead, Convergent focused its efforts on large corporate vendors like
Burroughs, NCR, Prime and Bull by developing machines for distributed
processing arranged around those vendors’ large systems. This gave
partner vendors a complete product line for their customers, drove
purchases and service contracts for their more profitable big iron, and
helped to insulate Convergent from the instability of retail.
<p>
<p>To make this work, Convergent had to constantly drive the cutting
edge to stay ahead of the market, which gained them the nickname of the
“Marine Corps of Silicon Valley.” Management candidates were told up
front to expect sixty-hour-plus work weeks or be disqualified, and some
designers reportedly worked close to 100 during crunch times. Within one
year it had its first product ready, the 1980 IWS “Integrated
Workstation” based on a 5MHz 8086 with up to 640K of RAM running CTOS
(“Convergent Technologies Operating System”), a multiprocess microkernel
operating system with support for IPC, networking and netbooting (over
RS-422). Among other companies, Burroughs rebadged the IWS as the B22
and called the OS “BTOS” (for Burroughs). Convergent followed the IWS in
1981 with the AWS “Application Workstation,” a cut-down diskless IWS
with less sophisticated graphics that Burroughs sold as the B21, and the
more powerful Intel 80186-based NGEN in 1983 that could also boot
MS-DOS. This was sold by many companies, Burroughs most notably as the
B25, but also Prime as the Producer 200 and NCR as the Worksaver 300. In
its MS-DOS form Microdata/McDonnell-Douglas sold it with their
Pick-based Reality database as the M1000 and Datapoint as the Vista-PC.
These systems were notable not only for their power but also their
unmistakable boxy modular expansion scheme developed by designer Mike
Nuttall. By 1982 Convergent had 800 employees and sales of $96 million
(about $313 million in 2024 dollars).</p>

</div>
Convergent also produced midrange systems for their clients. The biggest
at that time was the appropriately-named MegaFrame in 1983, consisting
of up to ten Motorola 68010-based processor boards (“application
processors,” in Convergent jargon) wired to as many as 28 (!)
80186-based I/O boards. Every board was an independent node with its own
operating system and its own memory: the 68Ks ran at 10MHz with up to
4MB of RAM for Convergent’s UNIX System III derivative CTIX, while the
’186s ran at 8MHz with up to 768K of RAM and custom versions of CTOS
depending on their task (filesystem, storage, cluster management or
terminal services). A fully-configured system took six enclosures of six
cards each and could handle as many as 128 simultaneous users, but the
system was perfectly capable of running just on the ’186 cards, and
Burroughs renamed CTIX to “CENTIX” and sold it both ways as the XE500,
XE520 and high-end XE550. Motorola, of course, preferred to sell the
’010-based variety, offering it under the recently acquired Four-Phase
Systems as the System 6600. In 1984 Convergent updated CTIX to System V
and made a single-68K eight-user version dubbed the MiniFrame using
custom I/O and supporting up to 2MB of RAM. In typical fashion it was
ready after just eight months of nearly round-the-clock development. It
was rebadged by both NCR and Burroughs, as well as Motorola, who sold it
as the System 6300; subsequently, the MiniFrame was further refined into
a workstation and sold by AT&amp;T as the 7300 UNIX PC in 1985.
<p>
In their continued efforts to anticipate market trends, Convergent
started evaluating the portables market in 1982 through its new Advanced
Information Products division, then based out of the Great American
Technology Center in Santa Clara (their former building at 2441 Mission
College Blvd is now
<a href="https://www.siliconvalley.com/2023/12/20/santa-clara-sutter-health-real-estate-office-rent-economy-tech-medical/">occupied
by Sutter Health</a>). At that time portables were seen as premium
products (compare with the
<a href="/2024/03/refurb-weekend-data-generalone-and.html">Data
General/One</a>) and handheld units even more so due to their novelty.
AIP noted in particular the 1982 Epson HX-20’s small totable form
factor, long battery life and light weight, as well as built-in
microcassette storage, but also its cramped screen and lack of
application software. AIP management determined that a purpose-specific
series of portable systems with built-in applications could do better
and carve out its own unique higher-end market. This strategy seemed to
be vindicated by the early 1983 introduction of the Kyotronic 85, a
portable Intel 80C85 system with a nearly full-size keyboard, 40-column
screen (the same as many home computers and portable PCs), BASIC, simple
text editor, and built-in modem and terminal program. Although a slow
seller for Kyocera in its native Japan, it was immediately licensed by
the Tandy Corporation as the iconic TRS-80 Model 100 in April (as well
as, among others, NEC as the NEC PC-8201A, which I once used as my sole
computer for a month on Penang Island in Malaysia) and went on to sell
strongly in Tandy’s Radio Shack stores. Codenamed “Ultra,” AIP’s
proposed handheld line used high-end but largely off-the-shelf
technology on a common hardware platform, differing primarily in
on-board software, RAM and built-in peripherals.
<p>
To Convergent’s dismay, their usual partners were unenthusiastic about
the entire concept. Even a high-end model would clearly sell for much
less than their workstation systems, necessarily with lower margins and
possibly requiring entry into lower-end markets where those companies
then had little or no presence. There were also questions about how much
money such a system could truly make given its high manufacturing costs
and the need to sell in volume, something new for Convergent who had so
far produced only smaller quantities of relatively niche hardware. In an
abrupt deviation from their usual business model, marketing manager
Karen Toland convinced Convergent leadership that consumer sales could
still be profitable — that is, if they chose the right consumers. Should
they make a splash in the market, she reasoned, the Ultra line could be
further expanded, and proposals existed to make a writer-oriented
version or a low-end cheaper unit for students.
<p>
<p>For launching the line, AIP decided to initially concentrate on a
single high-end model. They convened focus groups in New York City,
Chicago and locally in San Francisco where sixty management, consultant
and executive volunteers talked about their daily tasks and what
features they felt would improve them. From these groups the idea
emerged of using spreadsheets as the interface for executives who would
be unfamiliar with or uninterested in doing their own programming.
Although this high-end variant also had a keyboard and could be used for
text entry (though not its strong suit), the volunteers also suggested
the internal microcassette drive for voice dictation using a built-in
microphone (“executives don’t type,” Toland observed), and the device’s
built-in 300bps modem could additionally autodial telephone numbers and
serve as a speakerphone. The ROM even provided functions to exchange
spreadsheet data with another device or a connected mainframe, which
we’ll explore. The logic board and accessory PCBs were produced in Japan
by Oki Semiconductor using Oki and Hitachi chips, with final assembly
States-side. The focus group members got free units off the assembly
line in appreciation.</p>

<p>In August 1983 Convergent officially unveiled the WorkSlate at $895
(in 2024 about $2800), initially only through the premium American
Express Christmas catalogue, alongside an optional battery-powered
“MicroPrinter” for $295 ($910). Nevertheless, Convergent hadn’t long to
wait for market partners. New York securities firm EF Hutton had
recently announced their Huttonline service providing investment
information, account data and E-mail on their IBM mainframe and quickly
added the WorkSlate to the pre-configured computers they provided to
subscribers, along with their porkier IBM PCs and Wang systems. For
$1194 (about $3750) Hutton would send you a WorkSlate and MicroPrinter
with Portfolio Analysis software on microcassette and, of course, a
monthly bill. By November 1983 the WorkSlate was already in ComputerLand
and Businessland retail stores, two months ahead of Convergent’s
originally scheduled rollout.</p>

And here’s what you could have bought: the WorkSlate package came out of
the box with two audio tutorial microcassette tapes, a bonus blank
microcassette for your own stuff, the five-hour NiCad rechargeable
battery pack (which needs to be re-celled, but AA batteries will do just
fine and last at least twice as long), WK-102 AC adapter (which can
charge the battery pack), a full set of manuals, RJ-11 phone cord and
soft leatherette carrying case. The case is durable and stylish with a
front pocket and a nice crisp Velcro closure. The entire unit minus
batteries weighs a svelte two pounds nine-and-a-half ounces (1175g), and
measures the same as a 8.5x11” standard piece of letter-sized paper,
though it’s about an inch thick. This package is not quite complete as
it is missing the advertising material for Dow Jones, Official Airline
Guide and CompuServe, all of which were billed as “compatible,” plus the
phone keyboard overlay for the numeric keypad, both of which appear to
have been lost. Next to it is the MicroPrinter and its own carrying case
and peripheral cable, and on top is my only “Taskware” software package,
Loan Analysis.
<p>
<p>I own two WorkSlates, though neither are in completely working order,
and my second unit is in worse physical condition than this one. Both
have non-functional microcassette decks, apparently a common problem
with this machine, and this “display” unit also seems to have a bad
speaker. The other unit has a working speaker but a very dim LCD that
needs to “warm up” before use. You’ll meet this second unit soon enough
because we’ll be doing some hardware experimentation on it.</p>

The WorkSlate’s striking industrial design now looks thoroughly like a
product of its era, but in 1983 it must have seemed like it fell out of
a future timewarp. Here I show it with the battery pack, AC adapter and
phone cord — pretty much everything you would need on the road, though
the charger/adapter won’t fit in the case. The AC adapter is
negative-tip and supposedly 6 volts, but this one measured 9 volts, so
I’m not using it just in case (my trusty Radio Shack multivoltage
adapter powered it for this article instead; the Texas Instruments AC
9201 adapter should also work). It uses a typical 5.5mm barrel jack for
the power connector.
<p>
The keyboard on the unit is quite unusual, consisting of hard plastic
mostly circular keytops that are all but impossible to touchtype on,
though this wouldn’t have necessarily been considered a grave fault by
an intended audience unlikely to type much anyway. Other than being a
QWERTY keyboard, the layout is otherwise totally unique. It has no Enter
or Return key, replaced instead by the functionally equivalent Do It;
while there is a conventional alphabetic Shift, there is no number row
(moved instead to the side numeric keypad), requiring a green Special
key for most symbols acting like symbol Shift, Control, Alt and Command
all rolled into one. These symbols are silkscreened on the keyboard in
green, with other special keys printed in yellow.
<p>
<p>Function keys at the top select or enable menus, along with special
dedicated keys for Cancel (Escape), Options and selecting a Worksheet on
the left of the keyboard, and a cursor diamond pad in the centre
(reminds me a bit of the Commodore 116). The numeric keypad is more or
less conventional, but has extra mathematical operations, and is also
used for more symbols with Special. Finally, there are separate On/Off
and Eject buttons, though the Eject button is actually mechanical and
not part of the keyboard matrix.</p>

<p>Even the box itself screams 1980s. While hardly Memphis Group,
Nuttall’s textured slab motif with its perpendicular contours and
distinctive keytops was designed to attract the eye of the Reagan-era
executive as something fashionable and trendy instead of staid and
nerdy. Yes, this is the kind of computer murderous yuppies like

The most important ports on the WorkSlate are on top: two RJ-11 phone
jacks (one for the phone line and one for an optional handset, if you
choose to connect one; both jacks will work for either purpose), the
barrel jack power connector, and the GPIO port, which is marked
“Peripherals.” We’re going to spend quite a bit of time with the GPIO
port later on.
<p>
<p>Other controls are a potentiometer dial on the left side of the unit
for adjusting LCD contrast and another one on the right for speaker
volume, plus 1/8” jacks for connecting a monoaural earphone or external
microphone. These route to the tape deck and can only be used for voice
recording and playback.</p>

The underside of the machine has the backplate, battery doors and the
flip-up stand. Don’t remove that stand unless you absolutely have to:
putting it back in will almost certainly break one tab or the other due
to the age of the plastic, and both of my units’ stands were already
broken and had to be repaired with high-strength cyanoacrylate (I like
JB Weld’s light-cured type; cheap superglues aren’t sufficiently
strong). The large battery door slides off to accommodate either the
NiCad pack or four AA batteries, while the smaller door is pried up to
hold two 186 (LR43) 1.5V button cells used as backup. The button cells
last about a week even if there are no main batteries at all, but you
don’t need either set of batteries to power it with the AC adapter, and
you don’t need to remove the stand to access the main battery door (just
flip the stand up).
<p>
Both of my machines call themselves model WK-100 with the same FCC ID
and their serial numbers differ by nearly 2,000, so it seems unlikely
there are other variations given the WorkSlate’s short seven-month
production run. (However, see my footnote about this when we disassemble
one.) Because of a lawsuit that was filed at its cancellation, we know
there could have been at most 67,000 WorkSlates that ever existed, and
sales data suggests that Convergent sold no more than a few thousand.
Only a small number of working systems persist today, of course. More
about that at the end.

<h3>
A tour of the WorkSlate
</h3>
<p>
<p>Let’s take a little tour of the machine. I apologize for the
variability of these photographs since it was very hard to get a good
straight shot of the screen with no reflections. In particular they
don’t do the LCD much justice, which is in reality quite sharp and
contrasty for a 1983 panel even though it lacks a backlight.</p>

When you power it on for the first time, it asks you for your name for
occasional use in prompts and warning messages, and the clock defaults
to September 26, 1983 at 8:00am. I don’t know the significance of this
date other than the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident">Oko
nuclear false alarm incident</a>, in which Soviet Union lieutenant
colonel Stanislav Petrov correctly determined the Oko early warning
system had erred in claiming a total of five U.S. nuclear ICBMs were
inbound. No missiles ever arrived and a later investigation concluded
Oko had indeed malfunctioned. By disobeying Soviet protocol, Petrov
prevented sending a mistaken retaliatory strike and possibly triggering
nuclear war. He was not punished, but he was not rewarded either and
retired early the following year. The incident was never publicly
acknowledged until 1998 — which makes it impossible for Convergent’s
programmers to have known. Most likely this was just the particular date
when its firmware was finalized. Sorry to wind you up but I never miss a
chance to tell one of my favourite Cold War stories.
<p>
<p>The display is in the unusual dimensions of 46 characters wide by 16
rows high using 6x8 glyphs. Although the panel is theoretically
dot-addressible with a resolution of 276x128, the firmware doesn’t allow
for bitmapped graphics. The 46-character width may have been chosen to
allow a typical 40 columns in the cell region of the spreadsheet (using
the left six columns for the row number, cursor and padding).</p>

The spreadsheet layout is the standard lettered columns and numbered
rows format first popularized by VisiCalc. However, the WorkSlate
probably came by this layout via Microsoft Multiplan, which Microsoft
had licensed to Convergent in 1982 <!-- InfoWorld 2/15/82 --> to port to
CTOS for the AWS and IWS. Although Lotus 1-2-3 had come out in January
1983 to nearly immediate success, the WorkSlate’s development was well
underway by then and it likely had little or no influence on the
firmware. Each sheet supports up to 128 rows and 128 columns (labeled
A-Z and AA-DX), though how many can be simultaneously populated depends
on available memory, of course. A cell can hold no more than 128
characters.
<p>
The top row of the LCD is reserved as a status line and divided into
multiple fields. The leftmost field is the sheet name, which defaults to
“<tt> empty </tt>” (spaces are part of the name), and can be no longer
than eight characters. The second field shows the contents of the cell,
which is naturally blank on a cold start. Following the contents field
is the available memory, given as a percentage, which does double duty
for the tape counter (where appropriate) and the machine’s progress when
doing calculations. The blank field after that is where status icons for
the phone appear when enabled, such as ringing, off-hook or on-hold, and
the rightmost fields are of course the date and time. If the timer is
enabled, a little clock icon appears after the time.
<p>
<p>The status line is periodically replaced by flashing announcements,
most often “Replace backup batteries” on my units since I don’t have the
backup lithium batteries installed. Alarms and error messages appear
here as well.</p>

Basic numeric, string and formula types are supported, as you would
expect. Strings are limited only by the size of the cell and appear left
justified by default. Numbers are right justified by default and
internally stored as floating point, even integral values. There is no
way to know the exact internal representation but we’ll be able later to
determine each number consumes seven bytes of memory, suggesting
something like double precision arithmetic. However, the WorkSlate
predates IEEE 754 and the internal format obviously differs. For
example, entering a value like 99999999999999999 comes out as
99999999990000000, while both a Microsoft Binary Format 40-bit float (as
tested on a Commodore 64) and an IEEE 754 double would represent that
number slightly rounded up as 1x10<sup>17</sup>. The WorkSlate doesn’t
display exponents, and there is no way to enter a purely numeric
quantity <em>as</em> a string.
<p>
WorkSlate formulas are a curious mix. The general format also descends
more or less from Microsoft Multiplan, which to the best of my knowledge
was one of the earliest spreadsheets (if not the first) to indicate
formulae with an equals sign, and does not mark built-in functions with
an @ as VisiCalc did. However, unlike Multiplan which uses R1C1 relative
notation for cell references, the WorkSlate uses VisiCalc A1 absolute
notation, and also uses VisiCalc’s three-dot operator for ranges
(<tt>…</tt>).
<p>
That said, the most notable difference about WorkSlate formulas is that
they use “proper” mathematical symbols: division is entered as ÷, not /,
and multiplication as ×, not *. There is also a true inequality operator
(≠).
<p>
<p>Entry of strings and numbers is fairly straightforward, and they can
be edited with the cursor diamond and backspace, though entering many
common typographical characters requires awkward Special combinations.
But editing a newly entered formula can be even more irritating because
on initial entry the cursor diamond is used to indicate the cell you
want, not to edit the line.</p>

The WorkSlate has a very unique set of built-in functions and we’ll be
exploring these in great detail. Here’s one: bar graphs. The WorkSlate
has a primitive charting capability using the <tt>Line()</tt> function
which takes a character and a quantity, and emits that number of
characters. The quantity can be another expression, including a
<tt>Total()</tt> over a range as we’ve done here. Since they’re
formulas, change the underlying value and the generated bar changes too.
<p>
The lines and boxes on the display are generated using the WorkSlate’s
simple palette of graphics characters, many of which are accessible from
the DRAW option (but it’s possible to access the entire character set —
more soon). However, you can’t enter these in the formula the first time
around because the available menus aren’t orthogonal; you have to enter
a placeholder character and then change it. Some indicator characters
cannot be entered directly at all which was likely on purpose to avoid
confusion.
<p>
<p>There are no other chart types built-in, but we’ll fix that in the
second example program.</p>

Date and time arithmetic are also possible, with some limits, and as
they are treated as numbers internally can be used in formulas too.
Here, I’ve added 365 to various dates to advance the year (in cells A2,
A6 and A8) and 12 to the time in B1 to advance it by twelve hours (B2).
The 1983 default date and time does not appear to be an epoch: the
WorkSlate will accurately <em>almost</em> represent any four-digit year
from 1 to 9999, though you may need to explicitly indicate the century —
two-digit years are treated as 19XX, which is why A2 shows the year 2000
— and all dates seem to be treated as Gregorian. Although I didn’t
exhaustively test its leap year logic (I know, right?), 2/28/1899 plus
366 is 3/1/1900, but 2/28/1999 plus 366 is 2/29/2000, both of which are
correct.
<p>
I said almost because there is a curious bug in that years ending in 00
(2000, 1900, 1800, etc.) cannot be entered as such; they come out as 20,
19, 18, and so forth. Calculations on those dates are similarly affected
because the year in memory really is 20, 19, 18, etc. (e.g., x/x/20 +
365 is x/x/21), but if you add 365 to a correctly accepted year like
1899 you still get 1900, so it seems to be a problem with parsing the
year on entry rather than the internal representation. This glitch would
have become very obvious as the millenium approached but was likely
never noticed during the short window in which the WorkSlate was
commercially sold and used. More serious bugs are yet to come.
<p>
<p>In a (presently) less obnoxious vein, I should note for completeness
that the firmware also has a Y9999 problem in that 1/1/9999 plus 365
days ends up 1/1/9900 as shown in A8. If you are reading this document
from the year 10,000, may I be the first to congratulate you on keeping
your unit running that long and suggest that you simply take years mod
10K for date storage.</p>

applicable to most any instance, three pages’ worth cycled through by
repeatedly pressing it. You select the desired option with the function
keys under the screen or you can just press Cancel. The most important
of these options is probably CHANGE, which is actually necessary to do
some types of editing versus just changing cells directly on the sheet

are right justified (including dates and times) and strings are left
justified, but you can change that here. The decimal and whole formats
are of arguably lower utility, since they enforce a fixed two decimal
place and no decimal place display format (rounded), mostly of use for
financials where you might only work in integral cents or dollars.
<p>
<p>Edit operations like cutting, copying and pasting are also done from
Options, as is system setup. If you copy a formula to another cell,
unless you make the reference absolute with an @, cell references are
treated as relative and automatically adjusted for you. Oddly, you can
only cut and paste within the sheet you’re in.</p>

<p>The WorkSlate can handle up to five simultaneous worksheets, which
exactly maps to one side of a microcassette which can hold up to five
worksheets as well. Computer history lore holds that Boeing Calc (yes,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Calc"><em>that</em>
Boeing</a>) was the first spreadsheet to implement tabbed sheets in
1985, but I think this gives Convergent a credible claim to having
implemented something like it earlier, even if it wasn’t recognised as
such. Only the first two are “standard” (i.e., can represent any sort of
spreadsheet). However, each sheet is otherwise independent and the other
three by default are reserved for each of the WorkSlate’s “derived
types,” the memo pad, phone list and calendar. These are globally
available but to conserve space are not actually constructed in memory
until the first time you use them. It is possible to overwrite them and
recover the sheet slot and any memory they were using, but they will not
be available to you again in their default form until you cold-start the
unit.</p>

<p>The Memo Pad allows you to dictate to microcassette or type text
strings directly into large cells. By default the Memo Pad displays a
set of tape control options accessible with the function keys, replacing
the available memory percentage with a tape counter. The WorkSlate has
full software control of the tape motor and automatically rewinds and
stops as appropriate. However, the designers didn’t think the Memo Pad
feature through fully because you can’t write <em>both</em> voice and
binary data to the same side of a microcassette, even though the Memo
Pad will let you record and type simultaneously. As part of the
recording process, the WorkSlate writes a small binary header at the
beginning of a cassette saying if the tape is voice or data and the
firmware will prevent you from mixing the two. Instead, you dictate on
one side, then save the text on the other. You can play back the audio
through the WorkSlate’s internal speaker or using the side earphone/mic
ports.</p>

<p>The Phone List is a simple three-column phone book of which only the
first 14 rows are constructed automatically; more can be added by
copying empty rows or creating the cells by hand.</p>

<p>Analogously with the Memo Pad, by default the Phone List maps phone
options to the function keys such as answering incoming calls on the
connected phone line or putting the call on hold, turning on the
speakerphone, or opening a terminal connection. The feature that makes
the Phone List a “phone list” is the ability to autodial the number in
the current cell using the modem. Strictly speaking the dial feature
would work from any cell with digits in any worksheet, because the Phone
List is “just a spreadsheet” like everything else (see also the
<tt>Dial()</tt> built-in function, which will dial a number), but the
Phone List at least made the concept explicit. If you wanted to dial a
number manually, it was possible to put the numeric keypad into a
“phone” configuration (that’s what that missing overlay was for, since
it moves the numbers around).</p>

<p>Finally, the Calendar, which displays date and time options beneath a
constructed datebook. Similar to the Phone List, this only builds two
weeks of entries starting with the current date and only for 8am to 5pm
(oh, how I wish I only had to work 8-5), though you can change the first
date in B1 and the others will update, and you can change the hour
numbers manually as you like. Simplistically, you could just enter
appointments right into the cells and use it as an organizer; the layout
as constructed gives you half-hour slots.</p>

<p>But the WorkSlate also has an alarm feature. Let’s say you want to
meet Patrick Bateman for, uh, lunch. He doesn’t like it when you’re
late. I mean, he’ll kill you for that. Here, your WorkSlate can save
your life by reminding you five minutes before. Our lunch is set for
3pm, so we’ll set the reminder for 2:55pm.</p>

<p>You can then add text to the reminder which will appear when the
alarm goes off. The WorkSlate will put the text into the current cell,
overwriting any previous entry (so you can just set alarms to enter
schedule entries if you like; theoretically the number of alarms is
limited only by available memory).</p>

<p>What this has actually done is create an unusual formula in that
cell. We see our alarm text as a string, but then followed by a function
<tt>Alarm()</tt> with a date and time parameter which is the real
trigger. Notice that the alarm time, or date for that matter, doesn’t
have to have anything to do with the actual “time cell” you’re using:
the Calendar is also all “just a spreadsheet,” so <tt>Alarm()</tt> works
in any cell in any spreadsheet in exactly the same fashion too.
Conceivably you could even put an alarm in your phone book, say. The
idiom of “adding” (with a plus sign) the string to the alarm function is
how the cell’s text contents are set simultaneously with the alarm,
which in turn are used as the alarm’s label.</p>

The Calc button, however, pops up one of the WorkSlate’s two “desk
accessories.” These tools can run simultaneously with a worksheet. The
Calculator lets you do basic arithmetic but also can load and store
values to the current cell, or directly add and subtract with it. A
running history is displayed; with a MicroPrinter attached and the print
feature turned on (Special-Print), a ticker feed like a desktop
calculator is generated with negative numbers in red. After any
arithmetic operator, you can also enter arbitrary text to annotate the
entry which will also be printed.
<p>
<p>What makes these two subprograms (the second to come presently) true
desk accessories is that the spreadsheet remains live. While the
keyboard is primarily occupied by the Calculator, you can still move
around in the spreadsheet with the cursor diamond, and you can still
enter and modify cell values by using the CHANGE option (i.e., via the
Options key) while the accessory is running.</p>

<p>We can also see the back of the GPIO port next to the battery
compartment, with one of its lines going to the cathode (serving as
ground) and two to the anode. This will be important later. No, I don’t
know why there’s Scotch tape on the board either except possibly to hold
that tiny surface mount component on, so I did not disturb it. The nicer
of the two doesn’t have it.</p>

<p>The LCD display board (“Rev 2”) is all Oki chips. Although each line
of the TN LCD pancel is 276 pixels wide, each group of seven MSM5839GS
chips at the top and bottom can drive a line of 280 dots (40 dots per
chip), four of which are simply not displayed. These chips act as column
drivers. The row drivers are the two M5238GS chips in the centre, both
being 32-dot common drivers that using both groups of column drivers can
each refresh 64 rows of the screen (i.e., 32 times two). With two such
chips, one for the top half and one for the bottom half, we have all 128
rows for our observed panel resolution of 276x128. The refresh rate,
according to
<a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/convergent/workslate/">the partial
service manual on Bitsavers</a>, is a very stable 69Hz.</p>

<p>The logic board contains everything else including the speaker,
ports, microphone, pots, microcassette mechanism and primary
electronics. However, its most noticeable feature is the surprising
number of bodge wires, which is rather unexpected in a high-end device.
There may well have been PCB yield problems — or possibly late-breaking
hardware bugs — that required manual rework but it’s notable that the
rework itself is so extensive. It’s not clear whether Oki did this at
the factory or if it was done on final assembly in the United States.
Jeff Birt, who has done
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr-f9BsC730">a particularly
detailed disassembly</a> of the WorkSlate (YouTube video) and looked at
several units, told me that no two were alike with different boards and
correspondingly different bodges, though both of mine are the
C-60-00124-01 version with similar board work.</p>

Most of the action is at the top of the board (rotated 90 degrees
clockwise in this view). The CPU is at U20, an 8-bit Hitachi HD63B03RF,
and my original WorkSlate is in fact the first Motorola 6800-based
system I ever owned. The Hitachi 6303 (here in the bug-fixed “R”
variant) is an enhanced clone of the Motorola 6803, itself a ROM-less
variant of the Motorola 6801 microcontroller. The 6801 started with the
6802 CPU, a Motorola 6800 with an on-chip oscillator and 128 bytes of
RAM, but then also reduced the cycle time of several key instructions,
added ten additional instructions including 16-bit addition, subtraction
and (further enhanced in the 6303) multiplication, and implemented a
16-bit timer, TTL serial port and 31 parallel GPIO lines. However, the
6803 only supports 29 parallel lines, and on the 6303 many of those pins
are marked n/c, exposing only 13 which are divided into an 8-bit port
and a 5-bit port. These GPIO lines are additionally multiplexed with
part of the address bus and part of the address bus is multiplexed with
the data bus, or a standard 6800 bus configuration can be selected using
the 8-bit port as the LSB of the address.
<p>
The primary CPU clock comes from the crystal at X1, a 4.9152MHz
oscillator. This is internally divided down by four to yield a nominal
internal clock speed of 1.2288MHz, but for power savings reasons the CPU
is rarely running full-tilt: besides additional memory-to-memory
operations and a register-swap instruction, the 6303 also adds a
<tt>SLP</tt> “sleep” instruction different from the existing 6803
<tt>WAI</tt> “wait for interrupt.” In sleep mode, the 6303 actually
powers down its bus and runs no instructions but keeps the contents of
the internal RAM and its registers active and maintains the serial port
and timer, running on about one-sixth the wattage, until it is awakened
by an interrupt or reset. When otherwise idle the WorkSlate firmware
sleeps the CPU between its 10ms keyscan timer interrupts, effectively
reducing the average system speed to as low as roughly 125kHz. On top of
that, the 6303 can also enter a standby mode where the registers and CPU
state are dumped to internal RAM and then the chip halts completely,
powering only the internal RAM (the WorkSlate maintains power to the
rest of memory and critical components like the gate arrays and
real-time clock). When you press On/Off, this runs a ROM routine that
saves the CPU state along with a ROM checksum, then signals the tape
gate array at U29 (not visible here) to assert the CPU’s standby line
and power down. Pressing On/Off to resume will cause the tape gate array
to deassert standby and send a reset to the CPU instead. The CPU powers
back on and enters its normal reset vector, which looks at the internal
RAM to see if the ROM checksum still matches. If it does, then power
must have been maintained, and the CPU duly restores the rest of the
processor state to resume operation. Otherwise, a cold start occurs.
This detail will become relevant when we talk about a particular
critical bug in the WorkSlate firmware.
<p>
Serial data from the GPIO port, microcassette deck and modem data lines
are fed to the on-chip 5-line serial port; the on-chip 8-line parallel
port is wired to the modem control and ROM banking lines. Otherwise,
except for the on-chip peripheral registers at $0000 and the internal
RAM at $0080, all other memory and memory-mapped I/O in its address
range is manipulated via the decoder gate array at U13 (with the blue
sticker on it). Like most 8-bit CPUs, the 6800 family can access a total
address space of 64K. Main memory consists of eight Hitachi HM6116LFP-2
static RAMs in U1 through U8, each containing 2K for a total of 16K. The
RAM at U1, however, has a special purpose: 736 bytes of it provide the
screen memory as ASCII characters which are then turned into dot data by
the LCD controller at U11, a Hitachi HD61830. The HD61830 has built-in
character glyphs, but these are only 5x7, so to implement 6x8 glyphs to
paint the LCD with no gaps, external character data is provided by a
small ROM at U12 next to it. A special decoder gate array mode lets the
CPU manipulate the HD61830’s registers directly with its address bus
lines. Once initialized, the LCD controller then regularly fetches
characters from U1 and uses its external character ROM to generate the
pixel stream for the row drivers. All the CPU has to do is change
characters in the screen memory as needed and the LCD is automatically
refreshed. In addition to the LCD controller, the decoder array can also
select RAM, ROM, keyboard, tape gate array functions, DTMF dialer, or
the real-time clock.
<p>
There is mention in the service manual of a 32K RAM option, though it
describes it as “four 16K-bit by eight bit static CMOS RAMs” which would
actually be 64K. I’m not aware of any production WorkSlates with more
than 16K of RAM, 32K or otherwise.
<p>
<p>Other major chips visible here are the HD146818FP real-time clock at
U21 that handles the clock, calendar and upcoming alarm based on a
32.768kHz crystal at X2, the Mostek MK5089N DTMF touch-tone dialer at
U22 with its 3.579545MHz crystal at X3 (using the NatSemi MM74C374N
octal latch at U23), and the 300bps modem-on-a-chip Motorola MC14412 at
U24 with its own 4.0MHz crystal at X4.</p>

The lower left corner of the board (here rotated 180 degrees to put the
ROM markings right-side up) is where the ROMs and the tape gate array
live. The tape gate array is the large IC at U29, though it handles more
than just the microcassette deck: it has lines for the tape motor
control and data (with special circuitry for decoding tape signals to
serial data), system power (both from the On/Off button and the alarm),
battery voltages, audio input and output routing, and selecting the data
source for the 6303’s serial port. The decoder array treats it as a
device that the CPU can select and manipulate.
<p>
<p>The two system ROMs are at U16 and U15, both 32K Hitachi 23256
equivalents. Their date codes indicate second week 1984, which was well
into the WorkSlate’s brief commercial lifespan and makes them likely the
last, if not only, production ROM revision that exists. The decoder
array banks the appropriate ROM into $8000-$ffff as specified by lines
on the CPU parallel port (so as currently configured the machine can
support no more than 32K of RAM, even if more were physically present).
Pads for a third ROM are at U14 nearby which would likely have been used
in one of the other Ultra models, and the decoder array already has
support for banking this ROM in too should one be installed. If one of
my units quits completely, my next task will be to desolder and dump
these ROMs, since I’m not aware of any copy of any version of them
anywhere.</p>

<p>The cassette mechanism is a miracle of early 1980s miniaturization
which also makes it a nightmare to work on, especially since tape drive
issues appear to be the most common defect in surviving WorkSlates and
the microcassette failures on my two systems are different. The “nice”
unit has a stuck tape head that will neither reliably retract nor
extend, making reading tapes vary between unreliable and impossible.
Jeff’s video series I linked previously examines a similarly failed unit
which he determined was due to a small pin that fractured and prevented
the actuator from moving the head properly. This failure has the side
effect of preventing you from pressing the eject button and locking the
cassette door closed unless you can pry it up or push down the head.
Unfortunately his repair required rebuilding this tiny pin in his shop,
something non-trivial for an idiot like me who has to make sure he
doesn’t solder his own fool fingers together. This “beater” unit, on the
other hand, simply won’t spin the reels at all. It’s possible that both
its motor and head are bad.</p>

The tutorial tapes included with the WorkSlate are “just” audio (with a
data header telling the WorkSlate that the cassette is “just audio”).
They will play back with any standard microcassette recorder at the
faster 2.4cm/s speed and I have archived them in their entirety, though
the audio quality is merely adequate as I suspect they were recorded on
a prototype WorkSlate as well.
<p>
However, the Loan Analysis tape is all data, with an effective baud rate
(as with all WorkSlate data tapes) at a fixed 2400bps, 8N1 — exactly
like serial data, complete with start and stop bits. The trick is
converting it from its frequency modulation encoding (yes, the same as
the early floppy format, unlike other cassettes that use another digital
format or analogue encodings like FSK) to regular bits; FM is designed
to allow clock recovery despite jitter, but there seems to be more of it
on a tape than there is on floppy media, and the real unit has a
voltage-controlled oscillator at U19 to compensate which locks the speed
of the tape gate array’s decoder to the true speed of the tape. It
should still be possible to decode this and other Taskware cassettes
from an audio recording with some manual work, though that by itself
doesn’t help us with actually getting data in and out. Some people have
figured out tricks like
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R9yQTqEvN4">whistling into the
speakerphone</a> with a modem but that limits you to 300 baud.
<p>
<h3>
The MicroPrinter and the GPIO port
</h3>
<p>
<p>Fortunately there’s an even better way of exchanging data with the
unit or this whole article might not have been possible. Interestingly

<p>The MicroPrinter was the first of two peripherals produced for the
WorkSlate and the only one available at launch; the second, the $195
($600 in 2024 dollars) CommPort, was a combination serial-parallel port
device that was not available until January 1984, and is comparatively
rare. The CommPort was the only supported means for using a conventional
parallel printer. That said, even though this entry will use serial
access heavily, we don’t actually need the CommPort to communicate with
the WorkSlate — or even the modem to do so, for that matter, though I’m
getting ahead of myself.</p>

<p>The MicroPrinter is in fact a small portable plotter that uses four
coloured pens to draw on a 4.5” (11.5cm) paper roll. (Plotter dweebs
will have already guessed what’s under the hood just from that
description but please don’t spoil the disassembly for everyone else.)
It defaults to a 40 column width line, exactly what the WorkSlate would
display in the content area, but can also draw text in a “compressed”
form for a full 80 characters or render spreadsheets sideways with up to
24 or 48 rows. The colour settings in the WorkSlate only apply to the
MicroPrinter; the margin and paper settings only apply to a connected
parallel printer.</p>

A coiled 8P8C cable connects the MicroPrinter to the WorkSlate via the
GPIO “Peripherals” port. This cable carries both data and power: while
the MicroPrinter can be powered by the same AC adapter, AA batteries or
NiCad battery pack that the WorkSlate uses, you can power both units
from the other (the AC adaptor here could have been connected to either
device, and they can also share battery power, though running the
printer off the WorkSlate will probably kill its batteries rather
quickly). While there is a hollow in the MicroPrinter case that the
cable can snuggle into, the cable’s degenerating plasticizer has made it
so grotty that I keep it in a Ziploc bag in the leatherette case
instead.
<p>
<p>Only one peripheral can be attached to the port at a time, likely
because of the limited power budget. That makes our task simpler because
we don’t have to worry about daisy-chaining. One thing I noticed with
the WorkSlate propped up is that the profile of the main unit and the
printer both match, another nice Nuttall touch.</p>

<p>As before a laminated copper sheet covers the rear of the main
circuit board, but the plotter mechanism is instantly recognizeable as
an Alps DPG-1302. This was used in <a href="http://tandy.wiki/CGP-115">a
huge number of contemporary printer-plotters</a> and is best known in
the Atari 1020 and Commodore 1520, but also appeared in the Texas
Instruments HX-1000, Tandy Radio Shack CGP-115, Mattel Aquarius 4615 and
Astor MCP-40, rebadged by Oric and (though unreleased) Tomy, among many
others. The factory nylon gears in this mech are notorious for stripping
(<a href="https://www.soigeneris.com/alps-printer-plotter-mechanism-pinion-gears">replacements

When we flip up the board we see its main CPU, a Hitachi HD63A01V1F. If
this sounds like another 6800-family CPU, you’re right: the Hitachi 6301
is a clone of the 6801 microcontroller, and like the 6801 has its own
built-in ROM (4K) and RAM (128 bytes), though it only has 29 GPIO lines
like the 6803 divided into three eight-bit ports and one five-bit. It
has the same additional instructions as the 6303 including a “sleep”
mode which is also used for power-saving when the printer is idle. The
crystal at X1 is rather illegible but photographing it at the right
angle shows it to be a 4.9152MHz oscillator as well, which is also
divided down by four internally to yield the nominal clock speed of
1.2288MHz, same as the WorkSlate.
<p>
However, there is a <em>second</em> processor in the MicroPrinter,
arguably making it more powerful than the computer it’s connected to.
The HD44860 next to it is a little 4-bit microcontroller with its own
128 bytes (as 256 nybbles) of RAM and 4 kiloword ROM using 10-bit
instructions (hello,
<a href="https://www.intvprime.com/intellivision-faq/intellivision-faq-section-2-0-hardware/">decle</a>!),
plus a timer/counter, on-chip oscillator, 44 lines of GPIO and two
interrupts. Unlike the 6800, the 44860 is a strict Harvard architecture
CPU. All but one instruction run in a single 5 microsecond machine cycle
for an effective clock speed of 200kHz. Not unlike
<a href="/2023/01/here-be-four-bits-of-dragons-mattel.html">other 4-bit
CPUs we’ve seen</a>, the program counter treats the ROM as two banks of
32 pages each containing 64 words, and program execution stays in the
same page until changed with a long jump. To make it wackier, though,
the lowest six bits of the program counter are actually an infinitely
repeating polynomial sequence, so subsequent instructions are not
contiguous in ROM (and you thought
<a href="/2024/02/cap-x-and-comp-x-how-tandy-pocket.html">COMP-X was
weird</a>).
<p>
<p>After following some of the traces, my guess is the 44860 is
responsible for directly driving the mechanism. The 6301 acts as the
master, receiving instructions and data from the WorkSlate on the
peripheral bus and sending commands to the 44860, which controls putting
pen(s) to paper. (Jeff Birt disassembled
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTma44_E_Kk">a CommPort</a> and
showed that it actually has <em>two</em> 6301s in it, so it’s even more
powerful than the printer. They both run at 1.2288MHz also. Convergent’s
hardware designers must have found a special on 4.9152MHz crystals.)</p>

But all this would be academic if it weren’t for a unique feature of the
MicroPrinter: the WorkSlate supports using it as a typewriter, where you
can simply type characters to be printed immediately. That brings us to
the second WorkSlate “desk accessory,” the Terminal. Ordinarily the
Terminal is for the modem, where you can dial into a bigger system and
set it up to interchange data. As well as acting as a simple dummy
terminal, it offers the ability to send and receive whole sheets.
<p>
However, if the MicroPrinter is connected to the GPIO peripheral port,
the Terminal instead ignores the modem and sends data directly to the
printer. That gives us an opportunity: if we can act like a MicroPrinter
and do whatever dance it does with the WorkSlate, we can trigger the
Terminal through the GPIO peripheral port and send and receive data
directly — without a CommPort. Encouragingly, the partial technical
description describes the data as serial 9600bps TTL, 8N1. That’s just a
UART. Anything can talk to that!
<p>
<p>There’s one problem, though:</p>

That means something like a regular Ethernet or RJ-45 type cable is too
fat: it physically won’t fit in the port.
<p>
<p>I dithered over shaving down an Ethernet cable to make it fit, and
actually tried doing that with some files for a couple hours, though I
eventually abandoned the idea because I was worried the two sides
wouldn’t come out even (and my arms were tired). A tip of the hat here
to Lamar Owen on <tt>classiccmp</tt> who suggested one of the narrow
“universal modular” connectors sold by Sandman (not affiliated, just
satisfied). I made an order with them and we’ll talk more about that in
a second.</p>

In the meantime, we’ll need to figure out how the GPIO port is even
wired — something else that’s also not in the partial service manual.
Additionally, since the MicroPrinter’s ROMs are all internal to its
microcontrollers, we will only be able to determine its behaviour by
snooping the serial lines.
<p>
Connecting the coiled cable to a tester showed that it was wired
straight-thru except for pins 4 and 5, which are swapped. This sounded
suspiciously like a null modem swapping receive and transmit lines. We
saw by the board traces where the GPIO port receives power and ground,
so on the back end of the “beater” GPIO port connector I soldered
jumpers to ground and pins 4 and 5, and a couple of the others that
weren’t obviously connected to the power rails. (Spoiler: at the end of
this section we’ll have an easier way of hooking up devices without
having to modify the unit, so don’t worry — you won’t have to crack your
WorkSlate open to use the example programs.)
<p>
However, we also know that the GPIO port is not always connected to the
6303’s 5-pin serial port because the tape gate array can hook up other
sources. Walking the traces with the 6303 data sheet, we can see some
processor lines get brought out to a header at the top of the board. I
soldered a couple more jumpers to the data lines for the 5-line serial
port just to see what those were doing.
<p>
After fiddling with various permutations I was able to monitor serial
data going back and forth, and those demonstrate the WorkSlate can ask
an external device to identify itself in a completely old-school
standard way. With <tt>picocom</tt> in partial hex mode (<tt>picocom
-b9600 –imap tabhex,crhex,spchex /path/to/your/serial/port</tt>), upon
starting the Terminal the WorkSlate sends an XON (ASCII 17, ^Q) followed
by an ENQ (ASCII 5, ^E) out the GPIO port, which is the standard
transmission control character to command a remote station to send its
answerback string. The 6301 in the MicroPrinter responds with
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
1 MicroPrinter.
</pre>
</div>
<p>
followed by a CR-LF. This is an interesting string to receive because
the number suggests multiple printers could have been connected, either
giving a total number of devices or saying what their “device numbers”
were.
<p>
I don’t have a CommPort to figure out how that would have acted, but
after some experimentation I determined all the WorkSlate is looking for
is a single line feed character — if you send that in response, and
quickly since it only seems to wait about three seconds before reporting
an error message, the Terminal opens. Likewise, if you were wondering if
a connected device can command the WorkSlate to identify itself, it can,
and the WorkSlate responds even if the Terminal isn’t running. Send an
ENQ character yourself to the WorkSlate (Control-E) and it will answer
with
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
Workslate
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<p>plus a CR-LF. Very logical. In fact, this is exactly how you can
connect two WorkSlates together directly with the GPIO port, since they
will both respond to the other’s ENQuiry, and they will even share
power. It doesn’t seem like any of the other GPIO lines are used (other
than power), so everything is in-band signaling with all the advantages

Here’s what I bought from Sandman: a banjo with the “universal modular”
cable,
<a href="https://www.sandman.com/products/too6g-modular-2-4-6-8-pin-butt-set-banjo-adapter">part
#TOO6G</a>. For those unfamiliar with telco work, banjos connect to
phone jacks and break out the individual lines so you can connect a
lineman’s handset (“butt-set”) to a pair with just the handset’s
alligator clips. The name comes from older banjos which were in fact
circular and had a permanently affixed cable somewhat resembling the
musical instrument. Getting the banjo kit seemed convenient because I’d
need to break out the wiring anyway, so I could just use alligator clips
of my own to wire up the USB-TTL adapter instead of having to crimp a
cable and peel off the lines.
<p>
<p>Parenthetically, the design of this particular banjo is such that it
can be connected in series and used to tap the connection between two
devices on either end. We’ve already found out what we needed to know
without doing that, but this trick could be useful to you for something
else.</p>

<p>The universal modular cable was the right width but it still didn’t
fit. The reason is that there’s also a little key divot we have to carve
out. (The outcropping next to it is there to prevent the coiled cable
from being put in anything but a WorkSlate-family device, but it isn’t
needed to get the banjo’s cable to mate.)</p>

<p>We can demonstrate that the connection is good by looking for the 6
volt line we know is present from what we saw with the logic board. Six
volts is not TTL, so a line with 6V on it can only be the power rail. It
didn’t take me long to find ground on pin 1 and a strong 6V on pin 2. To
ensure we don’t fry anything we’ll leave that completely unconnected.
Pin 8 also appears to be connected to the power rail (more than 5V),
though at a lower voltage.</p>

Ta-daaaaa. We now have serial communications with the WorkSlate directly
through the GPIO port with our own cable. It’s time to program this
sucker.
<p>
<h3>
Spreadsheet storage and operations, or, Turing completeness is overrated
</h3>
<p>
I commented in the introduction that the worst thing a spreadsheet on a
8-bit CPU could be is Turing-complete, because being Turing-complete
implies the possibility of unbounded loops. (We’re going to ignore macro
facilities for this discussion and most 8-bit spreadsheets didn’t have
them anyway.) Even if your software were properly coded with a means to
halt a potentially infinite cascade of computations, it could make your
hard work all but unusable especially if the spreadsheet formulas were
highly complex.
<p>
The most common way this happens in a spreadsheet is with circular
references, where one cell’s calculated result depends on the calculated
result of another cell which depends on the result of the first one.
VisiCalc infamously had a strict left to right and top to bottom
evaluation order which could cause aggravating errors if there were
interdependent references. For at least a couple years the only
spreadsheet that could correctly resolve them was Sorcim’s CP/M VisiCalc
clone SuperCalc. Former product manager
<a href="http://feigenson.us/blog/?p=10">Wally Feigenson posits this
example</a> which also did not compute correctly in contemporary
versions of Lotus 1-2-3: given a particular dollar amount of gross sales
(he used $100 as an example), calculate your cost of sales as a
percentage (example, 60%) and calculate your gross profit (gross sales
minus cost of sales), and <em>then</em> calculate your profit sharing as
a percentage of net profits (example, 10%) and your net profits as your
gross profit minus the profit sharing.
<p>
<p>That last part is an obvious circular reference but is nevertheless a
plausible business calculation. On paper you’d end up doing the numbers
twice to resolve the problem, and that’s what SuperCalc did. Though
Feigenson cites this example to show off the new “iterative calculation”
feature in SuperCalc 3, his example works just fine in
SuperCalc<sup>2</sup> for MS-DOS:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

The correct answer for the example values is actually a net profit of
$36.36 and profit sharing of $3.64, but this is only due to the default
displayed precision and the answer is accurate internally. Unless you
came up with a macro to force another round of recalculation, however,
Lotus 1-2-3 would show zero.
<p>
Microsoft Multiplan had its own solution to this problem. Its evaluation
scheme builds a chain of dependencies and works down the list
(“compute-until-done”). If the process started hitting the same cells
again, it would conclude a loop was present and abort with an error
message. However, it could optionally run in an “iterative” mode where
effectively the loop limit was removed and it ran until the values
“stabilized” (defined as an absolute sum of changes between runs of less
than 0.001). You could even create a custom test condition for
termination, which could include a different delta value of its own or a
cap on the total number of iterations. This mode was very useful for
mathematical operations in particular (Newton-Raphson comes to mind) but
also allowed the possibility that a run could go infinitely. Likely
because of the pitfalls this could pose to an incautious user Microsoft
chose to remove iterative calculations for Excel and did not reimplement
it for almost a decade.
<p>
<p>As the WorkSlate’s strongest influence was Multiplan, it adopts the
same “compute-until-done” strategy, but with a twist. It will detect and
report a circular reference after the first run, yet it will allow
processing to continue for a fixed three iterations before terminating.
Consider this spreadsheet with A1 being <tt>=B1+1</tt> and B1 being
<tt>=A1+1</tt>:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

</div>
On the first run B1 is evaluated as zero, so A1 becomes 1 and B1 becomes
2. This demands a second iteration, so A1 becomes 3 and B1 becomes 4.
This demands a third iteration, so A1 becomes 5 and B1 becomes 6, at
which point the WorkSlate cuts off further evaluation and chides you by
name in the status row. You can manually press Recalc (Special-N) to
kick off another three iterations, yielding 9 and 10 and so forth, but
it never does more than that per run.
<p>
<p>Regardless, this means that Feigenson’s example will also work on
Multiplan (if iterative calculation is enabled), and by extension on the
WorkSlate:</p>

<p>The point of all this is to say that our WorkSlate programming
endeavours can’t depend on any computation where the number of necessary
iterations is unknown (and therefore potentially unlimited). On the
WorkSlate, <em>this is a good thing.</em> If you’ve ever worked for a
clueless executive, you know they will ask the impossible of you, and
they will ask the impossible of their toys too (but I repeat myself). It
is entirely plausible that someone got themselves in trouble during
testing with this and it would have had obvious impacts on battery life
and responsiveness. Because the WorkSlate was never meant to run
arbitrary programs, even though it makes this article more complicated
and there will be many computational operations we simply can’t express
in its spreadsheet’s terms, these limits are absolutely okay.</p>

<p>With that introduction, next we should figure out how worksheets are
sent and received so we can start writing our own in a more efficient
manner. Along with hanging up, pausing a transfer and the
irrelevant-to-us option for talking over the phone line we’re not using,
the Terminal has options for exchanging data (Send and Receive). Let’s
take the silly little spreadsheet we have onscreen and send it to the

We press Send and select the sheet we want, and the WorkSlate will
transmit it over the serial port via the connected banjo. Marking
control characters and trailing spaces, it comes out like this (all
lines are separated by CR-LF):
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
^R^R^Q\S C2 A1 A3  A E c[space]
\M 202
\N " empty  "
\W 13 9+2[space]
A1-"Allen"
B1-"Loves"
C1-"Cigars"
A2-1
B2-2
C2-3
^C^Q
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The control sequences are two DC2 (ASCII 18, ^R) characters, which on
TTYs would turn on the tape punch to start receiving data (again, very
logical), followed by an XON (ASCII 17, ^Q), and then the spreadsheet
data. At the end it sends an End-of-Text ETX (ASCII 3, ^C) character —
and here you thought ^C just meant “break” — and another XON, ending the
transmission. Sheet data always consists of the first four lines in
order (<tt></tt>), followed by rows and columns going left to right and
top to bottom, though it will accept them unsorted. After some fuzzing
and experiments, here’s what I think everything means.
<p>
The <tt></tt> line is quite obviously the name of the sheet, demarcated
by quote marks. It is always eight characters and padded with spaces.
<p>
The <tt></tt> line describes the maximal dimensions of the sheet (here
going from A1 to C2) with the cursor to be placed in A3. Notice that the
cursor position does not need to be within the bounding coordinates. In
fact, other than the cursor position itself, the WorkSlate doesn’t
appear to make use of these values on receiveback and will freely put
subsequent cell data outside of the stated dimensions. Similarly, the
last three characters (we’ll call them “flags”) don’t appear to do
anything either. For a typical generic sheet they are usually rendered
<tt>A E c</tt>, in that order and with that capitalization. However, the
Memo Pad and Phone List, should you send those, are marked with <tt>a e
c</tt>, and the Calendar is marked with <tt>a E c</tt>. The only pattern
I’ve found is that sheets where events may be present are tagged with a
capital E, and sheets with alternate cell alignments are tagged with a
lowercase a. Likely these were hints about what types of features the
sheet uses, maybe as a way to reduce power further by turning off
unneeded interrupts or chips, but since you can use pretty much any
built-in formula feature in any sheet, they don’t appear to actually
gate any particular attribute. If you alter the flags in a sheet and
send it back to the WorkSlate, it will preserve their values but the
sheet still apparently acts the same. For our code we will still set the
bounding box correctly and use the most common <tt>A E c</tt> flags on
the off chance they’re salient, somewhere.
<p>
The <tt></tt> line describes column width, out to the maximum column
given by <tt></tt>. The default layout, used here, makes column A 13
characters wide and everything else 9. (This default is also used for
any cell outside the bounding box where the width isn’t specified, by
the way.) As a little bit of compression repeated values are designated
with <tt>+d</tt>, so <tt>13 9+2</tt> indicates the sheet consists of one
column of 13 characters (A) followed by two columns of 9 characters (B,
C).
<p>
Special attributes like overlap and justification are not part of the
header lines; since they’re specific to an individual cell, they’re
appended to each cell entry after a space. The codes are, sensibly,
“D”ecimal, “L”eft, “R”ight, “W”hole and “O”verlap. An interesting thing
about overlap is that while the large cell is emitted with “O”, the
cells it overlaps are emitted also, just blank and empty.
<p>
Finally, the <tt></tt> line is how many bytes the spreadsheet is
expected to take in memory. Interestingly, the only use the firmware
seems to make of this value is deciding whether to even <em>attempt</em>
to load the sheet — if it’s bigger than available memory, then the
WorkSlate will immediately abort. Even if you make this value zero,
which surprisingly it will accept, it will still abort reception if the
sheet ends up exceeding available memory or the 128x128 maximum anyway,
so you can’t use such a trick to stomp on anything interesting (darn).
This behaviour is nevertheless useful to us because it means we don’t
really need to sweat getting the value exactly right as long as we
provide an acceptable one, though as a practical measure we’ll still try
to provide a proper estimate in our examples. Interestingly, you might
think that you could have a value up to 16384 here (i.e., 16 kilobytes)
and you would be wrong: remember that 736 bytes are required for the
screen memory minus various work areas minus table attributes minus the
128 bytes built into the 6303. Experimentally I determined the largest
value you can have for <tt></tt> is 12868 bytes, and that only for a
completely clean, empty system.
<p>
Memory usage for strings and numbers (and date and time values, which
are emitted in their display form but stored as numbers) is
straightforward to estimate. Every sheet starts at 144 bytes in size,
plus 2 bytes for every cell in the bounding box. The bounding box here
is 2 rows by 3 columns for six cells, so 12 bytes. Each number value
takes up eight bytes (presumably a tag byte followed by the floating
point value, see below for why the value itself appears to be seven
bytes), and each string value is two bytes plus one byte for each
character. If we tally this all up for the example, we get 144 + 12 + (2
+ 5) + (2 + 5) + (2 + 6) + 8 + 8 + 8 = 202 bytes, the reported value.
<p>
Incidentally, if you put a quote mark inside a quoted string, it just
gets sent inside the quoted string unescaped. The WorkSlate will figure
it out.
<p>
Formulas are a little trickier. Let’s look again at the WorkSlate
version of Wally Feigenson’s 1-2-3 torture test. I’ve removed the
control characters and terminal spaces for didactic purposes but they
are still present in the same positions.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
\S B5 A1 B4  A E c 
\M 299
\N " empty  "
\W 15 9 
A1-"Sales"
B1-100
A2-"Cost of Sales"
B2=.6~$~B1
A3-"Gross Profit"
B3=B1-B2
A4-"Profit Sharing"
B4=.1~$~B5
A5-"Net Profits"
B5=B3-B4
</pre>
</div>
<p>
What’s with the tildes? They’re how the WorkSlate’s extended character
set is implemented: paired tildes act like escape/de-escape sequences,
where characters between them are interpreted as symbols. Consider this
constructed sheet (I’ll get to how I actually got it in the system in a
second), where we escape all seven-bit printable ASCII characters in
turn:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
\S A3 A1 A1  A E c 
\M 0
\N "CharSet "
\W 40 
A1-"~ !"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./0123456789:;&lt;=&gt;?~"
A2-"~@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\]^_~"
A3-"~`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~~"
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<p>Uploaded to the WorkSlate, it renders like this:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgFPuXmsuRIJVOv-KqRC5hDx47J19MLhfvSdkqYrbh2guHr8bzw4enkKxtf89dvB2ZeYYESf0lbskqJ-xrXbdGLfg5ethUqj6dxq47tBMSpAk3ONZebYzpU94OWryasCHOTZfty_NpzZuTMysK_g9mdKXDDmUDYny1TRRXzpzJRL9xJkMFBBHFsAPQX0eE/s4080/PXL_20240814_041929756~2.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgFPuXmsuRIJVOv-KqRC5hDx47J19MLhfvSdkqYrbh2guHr8bzw4enkKxtf89dvB2ZeYYESf0lbskqJ-xrXbdGLfg5ethUqj6dxq47tBMSpAk3ONZebYzpU94OWryasCHOTZfty_NpzZuTMysK_g9mdKXDDmUDYny1TRRXzpzJRL9xJkMFBBHFsAPQX0eE/s320/PXL_20240814_041929756~2.jpg"/></a>
</div>
Most of the second and third row are not defined as anything except for
the very last character (RUBOUT isn’t printable), where a tilde
immediately followed by a tilde is treated as a real tilde. Instead,
almost all of the special symbols appear in the first row, where we see
little icons, some control character representations and line drawing
and graphics characters. Some of these characters can’t be entered into
a spreadsheet any other way than by sneaking them in here. If you trace
along the list, you’ll see that <tt><sub>$</sub></tt> is how we render a
WorkSlate × on a system that may or may not have that character.
<p>
I haven’t worked out all the pieces yet for formulas, but we can get
close. This is a 10-cell spreadsheet (A1 to B5), so we start out with
144 + 20 = 164 bytes baseline usage. We add (2 + 5) + 8 + (2 + 13) + (2
+ 12) + (2 + 14) + (2 + 10) = 236 bytes for all the strings and the
single number in B1. To save memory and speed execution time, formulas
are stored tokenized. My current theory is that each formula appears to
have a minimum usage of 8 bytes, plus 7 bytes for every number and 2
bytes for every cell reference, and then one additional byte for every
token (built-in functions, parentheses, operators, etc.). That means B3
and B5 are 8 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 13 bytes each and B2 and B4 are 8 + 7 + 1 + 2
= 18 bytes each. 236 + 18 + 13 + 18 + 13 = … uh, 298 bytes. I’m not sure
where the extra byte went. Fortunately the exact memory value doesn’t
really matter for what we’re doing here as long as we give the machine
something it can parse as a positive integer, with a sufficient fudge
factor so it doesn’t waste time loading something obviously too big.
<p>
We can use <tt>picocom</tt> to directly receive to a file by adding
something like <tt>–receive-cmd “ascii-xfr -rnv”</tt>, which will show
progress, prevent line feeds from being mucked with and capture all the
control characters for faithful transmission back. However, to get the
receive operation to terminate, you’ll need to manually send a ^Z from
the Terminal which you can do by pressing Special-C, releasing them,
then Z. Doing so doesn’t cause any problems because ^Z will never be
part of a spreadsheet transmission. Special-C works the same for all
other control characters.
<p>
<p>This format is completely different from Microsoft Multiplan’s, by
the way, which is pretty clear evidence that while the WorkSlate was
(strongly, in some cases) influenced by Multiplan it is definitely not
descended from it. In particular, it bears almost no similarity to
Multiplan’s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_Link_(SYLK)">SYLK</a>
format, and cannot read a sheet rendered as such.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

</div>
Now, how about sending something back to the WorkSlate? You can
overwrite any of the spreadsheets in memory, even the generated ones,
but actually transmitting data properly turned out to be trickier than I
thought. The problem here is flow control. I said that all the
signalling was in-band, and I could find no activity on the other lines,
so XON/XOFF software flow-control is all you have. If you’re connected
with the 300bps modem, this is no problem, because the 6303 is more than
fast enough to receive and process every byte as it comes. The CommPort
was a rare accessory, so it’s reasonable to assume most of its
contemporary users were doing this sort of thing over a phone line, and
that’s the speed they’d be at.
<p>
At 9600bps, though, it’s a problem. It was
<a href="/2024/07/pretty-pictures-bootable-floppy-disks.html">a problem
for the Canon Cat</a> to receive and reliably process every character
into the document as it arrived at that speed, and the Cat is a 5MHz
68000, so a 1.2288MHz 6800 (even an enhanced one) has no chance
whatsoever because there’s no ACIA or UART and everything here is
bitbanged. On top of that, since there is no hardware flow control in
the WorkSlate and XON/XOFF signalling is in-band, the buffering we take
for granted with modern serial interfaces is really going to ruin your
day. Usually by the time my code saw the XOFF, the WorkSlate was already
dropping characters and the receive would fail for all but the most
trivial transmissions. (I should note that the CommPort <em>does</em>
have hardware flow control, but it does it in “software” — i.e., one of
its 6301s is dedicated to the task and bitbangs the flow control lines;
there’s no UART or ACIA inside it either. What’s less clear about the
CommPort is whether it squeezes everything else into those two GPIO
serial lines.)
<p>
With the Canon Cat, we solved this with
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/sendfile.c">a
custom file sender tool</a> that introduces an intercharacter or
intercharactergroup (?) delay. We can use that here too and we’ll use a
variation of it later on, but <tt>ascii-xfr</tt> has a similar delay
option, so we might as well just use that for consistency with
<tt>picocom</tt>. After lots of fiddling, the fastest reliable
transmission rate seems to be with a 3 millisecond intercharacter delay;
counting start and stop bits (it’s 8N1), we get about 1.042 milliseconds
per character at 9600bps, increasing latency to 4.042 milliseconds per
character for an effective speed of 2474bps. Why not just transmit at
2400bps? Because the internal serial port expects 9600bps, and that
can’t be changed, so there.
<p>
Other than overruns, there are two minor bugs when sending sheets to the
WorkSlate. The first is that it doesn’t seem to correctly display the
new name of the sheet when receiving it (i.e., the <tt></tt> field),
even though the new name appears correctly after the transmission
successfully completes. The other one, to be relevant to the third
program example, is that upon its selection in the Terminal the receive
option sends two DC4 characters (ASCII 20, ^T) and then waits for you to
select the destination sheet. DC4 historically would signal teletypes to
turn on the punch tape reader, so again this is a logical signal byte to
send. However, while in theory this should alert the remote system to
have a sheet ready to go, in practice you have no idea when the transfer
will actually begin because the user could take any amount of time
deciding where to put the received data. Even more strangely, if the
remote side sends DC2 DC2 like the start of a spreadsheet while the
Terminal is active, the Terminal will <em>automatically</em> interpret
this as a Receive request and immediately ask you to select the
destination sheet, but it will <em>not</em> send DC4 DC4 in response.
That oversight seems like a bug, though admittedly another one most
people wouldn’t have cared about at the time. I’m just not “most
people.”
<p>
Nevertheless, with all that in mind, our command line for the next
couple examples will be <tt>picocom -b9600 /path/to/your/serial/port
–send-cmd “ascii-xfr -snv -c3” –receive-cmd “ascii-xfr -rnv”</tt> and
you can adjust that for your own terminal program such as
<tt>minicom</tt>, etc.
<p>
Let’s bring on the programs. Everything here is in
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/workslate">this Github project</a>
and the <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/workslate/">WorkSlate
WorkSpace</a>.
<p>
<h3>
Hack No. 1: Rock, Paper, Scissors
</h3>
<p>
We did
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/crap-x/tree/main/examples/classic">Rock
Paper Scissors</a> for
<a href="/2024/02/cap-x-and-comp-x-how-tandy-pocket.html">COMP-X</a>,
the first game I know of written for the Tandy Pocket Computer PC-5/6
Assembler mode, so on this occasion of what I believe to be the first
game for WorkSlate we’ll do the same. So that you could potentially play
this while the Calculator or Terminal are open, I made it just four rows
high and best out of three.
<p>
To make our programming tasks a little easier we’re going to write a
simple one-pass “cross-assembler” (a pre-processor, really) that will
take a soup of cells, organize them and then emit the proper headers and
control characters. It will also let us comment and annotate. As usual,
the
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/workslate/blob/main/wssc.pl">“WorkSlate
Spreadsheet Crossassembler”</a> (henceforth WSSC) is written in Perl
primarily to annoy people. Pass it an assembler source file as an
argument or on standard input and it will emit the ready-to-upload sheet
on standard output. It accepts cells written in the same way we’ve seen
above, but cell width can be optionally added to any cell with a dot
(like <tt>B1.13-“hello world”</tt>). The cross-assembler will keep track
of what cells were what width and emit the proper <tt></tt> header (or
stop with an error if there are inconsistencies, since width is per
column). You can attach attributes like justification or number format
to a cell in the same way we saw above (e.g., a space followed by
<tt>R</tt> for right justification). Pseudo-ops manage starting cell,
default column widths and worksheet name, and lines can be commented out
by starting them with <tt>#</tt>.
<p>
There is no documentation out there anywhere on the WorkSlate’s unusual
set of built-in functions other than the infrequently encountered (and
maddeningly incomplete) Reference Guide, so I’ve taken it upon myself to
create the
<a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/workslate/">WorkSlate
WorkSpace</a> as a supplemental resource. You can refer to it for more
details on some of the functions we’ll use here and in the next two
hacks.
<p>
This and the next hack will depend, completely in the second hack’s
case, on the <tt>If()</tt> conditional function. This function is almost
exactly the same as in Multiplan, and even modern Excel: given three
parameters, it returns the second parameter if the first is true, or the
third parameter if it’s false. Also like Multiplan, you can combine a
list of conditions with <tt>And()</tt> and <tt>Or()</tt>, invert them
with <tt>Not()</tt>, and chain <tt>If()</tt>s together by using another
<tt>If()</tt> as one of the arguments. Note, however, that the WorkSlate
uses plain tokens <tt>True</tt> and <tt>False</tt> instead of
Multiplan’s functions <tt>True()</tt> and <tt>False()</tt>.
<p>
The WorkSlate also has Multiplan’s same limitation on string
comparisons: there are none. This is very clear in Multiplan’s
documentation but not in the WorkSlate’s. In particular, we can’t do
moves in this game by entering Rock, Paper, Scissors, or even the
letters R, P, and S, because while <tt>If(A1=“P”,“Paper”,“Not
Paper”)</tt> doesn’t result in an error (and I do consider that a bug),
it doesn’t ever evaluate as true. Comparing ASCII values doesn’t work
either, for that matter, so the moves you will enter must be numeric.
<p>
<p>Since this is a Turing-incomplete spreadsheet, it can’t “wait” for
your answer because that would be an unbounded loop, but part of the
game is to reveal the computer’s move only after you do and we want (at
least to make it look like) it’s doing it one at a time. The
<tt>IsNA()</tt> function tests if the cell is not a number (“NA” is
short for “not available for calculation”), which also evaluates to true
for blank cells, so if our moves are in column A and the computer’s are
in column B, we’ll have B1 be <tt>B1=If(IsNA(A1),““,F4)</tt> to wait for
a valid number in A1 before revealing our computed move from F4.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyExy1TQr_AiKLKBzHJikB9e3J2oG7-EGGNEJSoWwdi_dwjg9QunrbKEFhHPTMOSORSR5IpQ05w6FcNTjlQemRd062lrD3R62EmrrgvOTXr5EKvURA6LgVbjOj6ZDeI9u44UF5I6PQIeDj6ciPCYQxjTNekA6Z0vBL0nB49WQGRFCdZhFelAQ0bBsE7vQ/s4080/PXL_20240821_042847685~2.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjyExy1TQr_AiKLKBzHJikB9e3J2oG7-EGGNEJSoWwdi_dwjg9QunrbKEFhHPTMOSORSR5IpQ05w6FcNTjlQemRd062lrD3R62EmrrgvOTXr5EKvURA6LgVbjOj6ZDeI9u44UF5I6PQIeDj6ciPCYQxjTNekA6Z0vBL0nB49WQGRFCdZhFelAQ0bBsE7vQ/s320/PXL_20240821_042847685~2.jpg"/></a>
</div>
How do we compute those moves? Ordinarily I would reach for a simple
pseudorandom number generator like Xorshift to generate it, but we have
no bit math operations at all in the WorkSlate, just basic arithmetic
and some statistical functions. In particular, that means we have no
exclusive-OR. Off-screen columns F, G and H take a seed value in E1 and
compute out <em>really</em> pseudorandom numbers from it. The
sucky-pseudo-pseudorandom number function I made up for this
demonstration is excruciatingly bad, sufficient to give
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/djb.html">D. J. Bernstein</a> a really nasty
twitch and just enough to basically work for some four digit seeds
(provable improvements solicited — be prepared to show distributions).
Since the computer’s moves are supposed to be random anyway, we just
precompute them upon a change in seed value, and reveal them one by one
as the player column cells start having valid digits in them.
<p>
<p>Computing the winner ran into another problem. The numbers are set so
that higher numbers beat lower numbers, but paper covers rock, so we
check for that specifically. On each turn the player gets a score of 1
for winning, 0 for a tie or -1 for losing. Unfortunately, a perfectly
reasonable single-cell formula for this like
<tt>C1=If(IsNA(A1),““,If(And(A1=0,B1=2),1,If(And(A1=2,B1=0),-1,If(A1&gt;B1,1,If(B1&gt;A1,-1,0)))))</tt>
is too big for the WorkSlate, even though it fits in 128 characters. The
limit on formula length, again experimentally determined, seems to be
about 108 characters. Instead, we calculate the second set of conditions
(which one is greater) in off-screen column I and do the check for
paper-rock in column C, using the value in I if not.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj53gkGDFICY687xFaZ0VsfPATJNTJdofLla7u3NVWJ0q9Q-X21fe2HJlyeMblrjJsUL0HrEcsMkpL4bC1r6ao6sGRy34-kgNx2OOgY7T5AhoTJbJuslYK-P-krbokQb2Lmz029nYBRbRdkvTLa9KZ_krMIiyXuHLbD2vopVNp-PlNBDCnDrNEUvlOdCv4/s4080/PXL_20240821_042745090~2.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj53gkGDFICY687xFaZ0VsfPATJNTJdofLla7u3NVWJ0q9Q-X21fe2HJlyeMblrjJsUL0HrEcsMkpL4bC1r6ao6sGRy34-kgNx2OOgY7T5AhoTJbJuslYK-P-krbokQb2Lmz029nYBRbRdkvTLa9KZ_krMIiyXuHLbD2vopVNp-PlNBDCnDrNEUvlOdCv4/s320/PXL_20240821_042745090~2.jpg"/></a>
</div>
To make a somewhat responsive interface, I ended up scattering
<tt>IsNA()</tt> tests all over the place as signals. As long as any one
of the three player spaces (A1-A3) are incomplete, then there will be no
score in column C for that row, and there will be a blank cell in I4.
Once all three moves are made, though, we sum column C to I4 and report
a winner, replacing the instruction text, and directing the player to
clear column A to play again. For example, D3’s formula is
<tt>D3=If(IsNA(I4),“0=PAPER”,If(I4&gt;0,“YOU WON”,If(I4=0,“WE TIED”,“I
WON”)))</tt>, which replaces that part of the instructions with the
winner.
<p>
Nothing prevents you from entering bogus values or playing in the wrong
column or playing out of order, because we don’t control the interface.
Winners don’t cheat (or do drugs, for that matter). If you don’t want to
play nice, then the only person you’re hurting is yourself. You don’t
want to hurt yourself, do you?
<p>
Here’s a video. The WSSC source is
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/workslate/tree/main/rps/rps.w">in
Github</a>, with
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/workslate/tree/main/rps/rps.ws">a
ready-to-upload sheet</a>. We demonstrate a full game from start to
finish, ending in clearing column A as a player would. Notice the
recalculation progress indicator in the status row when we enter our
moves, showing the number of cells yet to be evaluated counting down as
computations complete.

<h3>
Hack No. 2: Pie Charts on the WorkSlate
</h3>
<p>
Remember those bar charts I showed you way, way back at the beginning?
Good times, but they aren’t enough. If we’re going to have business
cards with watermarks, then by golly we’ll have to have better charts
here in the 1980s office or heads will roll. Literally, perhaps. Plus,
would Stringfellow Hawke put up with this from his nav computer?
<p>
What I really wanted to do here was figure out a means of primitive
graphics. The firmware does not support treating the screen as a bitmap,
so everything would need to be character cells. If we set up a matrix
where every column in the, cough, “frame buffer” is one, gurgle, “pixel”
(the rows are already), then by assigning a formula to every single cell
we can draw something at the highest, urgh, “resolution” the WorkSlate
firmware will permit. That’s not outrageous, or at least not by
<em>my</em> standards of outrage.
<p>
Still, you should have already guessed the pitfall here: memory usage.
My first attempt was to draw a Mandelbrot set off a set of coordinates.
The typical algorithm requires you to iterate on each pixel until you
can decide if it’s actually in the set or not, or you’ve exceeded an
upper bound on number of times through the loop. Pixels that are
<em>not</em> part of the set typically get a colour based on how many
runs it took to figure that out, but the set itself is black, so it can
be drawn in monochrome. Experimentally it took at least six iterations
to yield something that looked like the set should look on a screen this
blocky, and much below 14x10 (yes, really) it became unrecognizeable, so
that was the lower bound on detail.
<p>
By also reducing the, er, “colour depth” (i.e., the extent of our
graphics character palette) we didn’t need to save the result of every
computation and it was possible to collapse the six iterations into a
collective double iteration, a test, a triple iteration and then a
second test. I modeled this in Perl and got a (barely) credible result:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......8..  
&nbsp;&nbsp;......88... 
&nbsp;......88888..
&nbsp;...88888888..
&nbsp;..888888888..
888888888888..
&nbsp;..888888888..
&nbsp;...88888888..
&nbsp;......88888..
&nbsp;&nbsp;......88... 
</pre>
</div>
<p>
So I wrote a script to spit out all the formulas as WSSC source.
Unfortunately, this reduction still generated huge formulas for every
displayed cell, and since we have limits on formula length, it ended up
soaking up <em>nine</em> off-screen cells for each of the 140 on-screen
“pixels” (A1, A2, B15 and B16 contain part of the coordinates and some
pre-calculated ratios):
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
D51=A1+(B15~$~2)
D52=A2+(B16~$~5)
D53=((((((D51~$~D51)-(D52~$~D52))+D51)~$~(((D51~$~D51)-(D52~$~D52))+D51))-((2~$~D51~$~D52+D52)~$~(2~$~D51~$~D52+D52)))+D51)
D54=(2~$~(((D51~$~D51)-(D52~$~D52))+D51)~$~(2~$~D51~$~D52+D52)+D52)
D55=((((D51~$~D51)-(D52~$~D52))+D51)~$~(((D51~$~D51)-(D52~$~D52))+D51))+((2~$~D51~$~D52+D52)~$~(2~$~D51~$~D52+D52))
D56=((2~$~D53~$~D54+D52)~$~(2~$~D53~$~D54+D52))+D51
D57=((((D53~$~D53)-(D54~$~D54))+D51)~$~(((D53~$~D53)-(D54~$~D54))+D51))-D56
D58=(2~$~(((D53~$~D53)-(D54~$~D54))+D51)~$~(2~$~D53~$~D54+D52)+D52)
D59=(((((D57~$~D57)-(D58~$~D58))+D51)~$~(((D57~$~D57)-(D58~$~D58))+D51))+((2~$~D57~$~D58+D52)~$~(2~$~D57~$~D58+D52)))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Notice that this doesn’t include actually setting the pixel itself —
this is just the computations to determine what the pixel should be.
Incredibly some tests with a couple runs of pixel math all parsed but
when I tried to load the whole thing the WorkSlate completely ran out of
memory about halfway through. Given we were already scraping the bottom
in terms of rendering quality, that was the end of that.
<p>
But the idea was sound, so I thought about something else we could
implement where the necessary math for each pixel could be lighter. And
what would be more appropriate for a spreadsheet machine than another
graphing option? Enter … the WorkSlate Pie Chart!
<p>
For simplicity we will assume a <s>spherical cow</s> simple two-value
pie where they sum to 100% (viz., the percentage that is and isn’t
Pac-Man), so we can just work with a single value. Here, a percentage
will be most convenient. The portion of the pie that should be painted
can be made up of a sufficient number of lines emanating from the centre
of the circle to touch the given percentage of the circumference. For
example, if we provide the value 47%, then we will start at a point on
the circumference of the pie chart and travel an arc covering 47% of
that circumference, drawing radii to every point we reach and moving
along the circumference at intervals sufficient to ensure painting all
the pixels in the sector covered by that arc.
<p>
I wrote a script that does exactly this for every integer percentage
between 1 and 100 with an adjustable radius, plotting a disc with its
center at (radius, radius) so that we aren’t dealing with negative
coordinates. Arbitrarily we’ll start the walk at (2r, r) and move
clockwise. For each percentage value, we use a simple Bresenham’s line
algorithm to draw a virtual line and examine each of the cells it would
pass through. What we want is to record the <em>lowest</em> percentage
value that cell would be painted for. If subsequent lines touch that
cell but it would already have been painted by an earlier value, we
don’t change it. At the end it spits out WSSC source that we can
assemble.
<p>
A radius of six turned out to be a nice value and with rounding on cells
this large yielded a 13x13 pie with an actual radius of about 6.6667,
about as big as could reasonably fit onscreen anyway. Each pixel formula
ended up looking like this (WSSC source):
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
C5.1=If(IsNA(A1),"",If(A1>=55,"~:~","~?~"))
C6.1=If(IsNA(A1),"",If(A1>=52,"~:~","~?~"))
C7.1=If(IsNA(A1),"",If(A1>=49,"~:~","~?~"))
C8.1=If(IsNA(A1),"",If(A1>=46,"~:~","~?~"))
C9.1=If(IsNA(A1),"",If(A1>=44,"~:~","~?~"))
D10.1=If(IsNA(A1),"",If(A1>=41,"~:~","~?~"))
D11.1=If(IsNA(A1),"",If(A1>=39,"~:~","~?~"))
D3.1=If(IsNA(A1),"",If(A1>=60,"~:~","~?~"))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<p>Our percentage value is in A1. If it’s not set, we display no pixel
at all. If it is, then if it’s over that cell’s lowest critical value we
display a filled cell and a non-filled cell otherwise (using tilde
escapes). Because we only emit formulas for cells that <em>could</em> be
part of a 100% pie, we don’t waste any memory defining cells outside the
disc. There are no other built-in functions involved — it’s all
<tt>If()</tt>.</p>

</div>
The last step is to pretty it up a bit, so I drew a little half box
around the percentage indicator and added a prompt which disappears when
a valid number is entered. There is also a field for you to title your
fabulously autodrawn pie chart.
<p>
<p>I also want to point out that on this totally clean machine with
nothing else in RAM <em>but</em> the pie chart sheet, we’re already
using 51% of its free memory!</p>

I thought about graphing 51% to make the point, but eh, here’s a
quarter.
<p>
And here’s a video. The Perl generator is
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/workslate/tree/main/pie/piegen.pl">in
Github</a>, with
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/workslate/tree/main/pie/pie6.w">ready-to-assemble

<a href="https://github.com/classilla/workslate/tree/main/pie/pie6.ws">a
ready-to-upload sheet</a> for radius “six” as displayed. We test 1%, 2%,
10%, 47%, 82%, 100%, 9999999999% and -3%.

<p>
Every time the pie is recalculated, you’ll notice that the progress
indicator always starts at 138. That’s because there are exactly 138
cells in the circle, which is its precise on-screen area after rounding:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% perl -e 'print ((355/113)*((20/3)*(20/3)));print"\n"' # that is, (pi)r^2
139.626352015733
% grep -c -F 'If(' pie6.ws
138
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And, indeed, every possible pixel is recomputed every time the
percentage value is changed, a very direct measurement of the disc’s
area. QED.

<h3>
Hack No. 3: The WorkSlate Surfs Gopherspace
</h3>
<p>
I promised you bugs, and now you shall have bugs. Bugs
<a href="https://travpaul.wordpress.com/2013/11/13/fedora-20-beta-installer-warning/">you
must live with</a>. Bugs that make <i>Naked Lunch</i> look like Snoopy
with writer’s block. I’m not kidding, either: the bugs we’ve encountered
up to this point were annoying, and some seemed just plain sloppy, but
all of them were correctable or could be worked around. The bugs in this
section, however, can cause data loss or even make the WorkSlate crash
so hard it will think it lost power. The worst part is I can’t find
anything exploitable about them, so for the misery they cause they give
us nothing in return.
<p>
In the slavering bestiary that is the WorkSlate’s built-in functions
inventory (again, see
<a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/workslate/">the WorkSlate
WorkSpace</a> for more detail), we’ve seen unusual functions like
primitive bar graphers and phone dialers and alarm setters. But recall
that Convergent was unusually sensitive to where the market was going
because the products they were developing for their partners had to be
relevant when they finally hit retail. The new age of the microcomputer
inspired wild feats of fantasy about a pervasively connected future
where we might read completely virtual articles on computer screens,
transmitted on wires and hosted on distant servers (ha, like that would
ever happen). An exec who could afford a WorkSlate probably also had
enough dough, or worked for a corporation with enough dough, to have an
account on a service
<a href="/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">like The
Source</a> or CompuServe, and these were the very people Convergent was
trying to entice.
<p>
To that end Convergent added a whole class of built-in functions that
handle serial communications. Among other things, you could set up a
series of spreadsheet cells that dialed an external computer, sent
credentials, waited for a command prompt, sent a command, pulled data
and then hung up, jumping from cell to cell automatically. If you set an
alarm on the first cell, it would even turn itself on and do it
unattended overnight when connect charges for those services were
substantially less. This kind of thing was exactly why EF Hutton
immediately added it to their supported systems list for Huttonline, for
example — out of the box, their subscribers could now use the system in
the sci-fi super-connected manner everyone expected the new wave of
computers to do.
<p>
Well, theoretically, anyway. Here’s an example combining two real
sessions from the manuals. Consider a system where you enter a login ID
and password, and then at a command prompt, ask for a stock quote. On a
typical dumb terminal, that session might look like this (totally
plausible, mainframe
<a href="/2024/03/an-apple-district-managers-macintosh.html">systems
like GEnie</a> worked this way too), with what you would have typed in
bold:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
ENTER ID: <b>JOE</b>
ENTER PASSWORD: <b>793AZY702</b>
! <b>STOCK QUOTE</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This string of ten cells would pull the results of the stock inquiry
down for you into a sheet, assuming the remote system could speak in
WorkSlate sheet format. <sup>C</sup><sub>R</sub> is one of the WorkSlate
graphic characters intended to visually represent a carriage return
(there was also an <sup>L</sup><sub>F</sub> for line feeds).
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
A1="Wake Up"+Alarm(9/5/2024,1:00am)+GoTo(A2)
A2="LOGIN"+Dial("5551212",Data)+GoTo(A3)
A3=Delay(2)+WaitFor("ENTER ID: ")+GoTo(A4)
A4=Send("JOE<sup>C</sup><sub>R</sub>")+GoTo(A5)
A5=WaitFor("ENTER PASSWORD: ")+GoTo(A6)
A6=Send("793AZY702<sup>C</sup><sub>R</sub>")+GoTo(A7)
A7=WaitFor("! ")+GoTo(A8)
A8=Send("STOCK QUOTE<sup>C</sup><sub>R</sub>")+GoTo(A9)
A9=Keep(B1...C1,1,1,20)+GoTo(A10)
A10=HangUp(0)
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<p>The alarm in A1 would run this for you at 1am on September 5th, but
you could run it anytime by starting the sequence from A2. You could
even consolidate these into fewer cells; the + conjoins the functions,
and then <tt>GoTo()</tt> jumps to the next. Now, you’re screaming at
your screen reading this completely virtual article that this is
ludicrous because how could you prevent this script from running
automatically every time the spreadsheet gets recalculated? Simple: it
<em>doesn’t</em> run automatically every time the spreadsheet gets
recalculated.</p>

</div>
All of the functions in this class, <tt>GoTo()</tt> included, display a
little key icon next to them. This is another graphics character you
can’t enter directly from the keyboard. On those cells, to kick off a
sequence, you press Special-Do It and then it goes down its list. Except
for <tt>GoTo()</tt>, if there’s no active connection, it will try to
establish one (either with the Terminal or the modem, depending).
<p>
(Side note: does that mean you could use <tt>GoTo()</tt> to implement an
infinite loop after all? Yes, but only a completely useless one. While
execution of these functions is deferred until you give the start signal
with Special-Do It, <em>other</em> calculations are <em>not</em>, which
is how the string labels worked in the example above. In particular,
something like the trivial circular reference example we had before
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
A1=GoTo(B1)+B1+1
B1=GoTo(A1)+A1+1
</pre>
</div>
<p>
still immediately evaluates to 5 and 6 and gives you an error even
before you hit Special-Do It. When you press Special-Do It, it loops,
all right, back and forth between A1 and B1, but their values never
change.)
<p>
I said “theoretically,” and I mentioned bugs, so let’s talk about our
first one. The <tt>Keep()</tt> feature is designed to parse ASCII
formatted text into cells. You pass it a range, the first line of data
to start parsing, the first character position of data to start parsing,
and the maximum length of each line. Go right ahead and try it. Even if
you pass it data formatted as instructed in the manual’s example,
<tt>Keep()</tt> will faithfully import it, but then just sits there. I
tried sending lots of permutations of every control character I could
think of, even the ETX XON at the end of regular sheets, and
<tt>Keep()</tt> just keeps on keepin’ on until it times out (90
seconds), you press Cancel, or you get kicked off. If you’re
interactively logged onto a service and able to cancel when the
transmission completes, maybe that was enough in the day, but it doesn’t
seem to work as described in the manual.
<p>
However, that’s more obnoxious than serious. Here’s the bad part:
<tt>Keep()</tt> <em>does</em> terminate properly if you pass it sheet
data instead of plain ASCII text. Unfortunately, it then proceeds to
ignore the cell range you gave it and <em>overwrite the entire
sheet</em> like you did a receive. But not all of it, by golly: it will
filter formulas out in some misguided way of protecting you from
mal-Taskware, I guess, meaning you can’t even pass it the same formulas
back to reinstate them. You’d better hope your beautifully written login
script was written to tape because if it gets what looks like a sheet,
that script and the rest of the current worksheet are toast.
<p>
Well, then, let’s see what alternatives we have, and there’s a really
encouraging-looking one in the manual called <tt>SheetIn()</tt>. This
takes a single dummy argument, officially zero. “Theoretically” (that’s
called foreshadowing, kids), it should be able to just automatically
replace the sheet we’re viewing with the sheet it receives. I wrote up a
test program that sends almost the exact same sheet data twice,
differing only in the string so that we can see we completed the
transmission. The first time, we’ll send it
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
A1=SheetIn(0)
A2-"Hello World"
</pre>
</div>
<p>
and the second time
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
A1=SheetIn(0)
A2-"Yello Wyrld"
</pre>
</div>
<p>
which will both compute out to the same dimensions and same memory
usage. We’re replacing nothing but the string and even that is the same
length, so if any contrived setup can work, it should be this one. After
opening the Terminal, we press Do It, signaling the test program to send
the first set of cells after a delay. We then load into the current
sheet using the regular Receive option, which works fine. So far so
good.
<p>
Now we press Do It again in the Terminal to signal the test program to
send the second version, again after a delay, and press Special-Do It in
A1 to receive it with <tt>SheetIn()</tt> this time. The receive
completes successfully, A2 changes to the new string — <em>and the
machine crashes.</em> In fact, it crashes so hard that <em>all data is
lost!</em> This is such an explosive bug I just have to show you a video
of it:
<p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen" width="320" height="266" src="https://www.blogger.com/video.g?token=AD6v5dxwq5gxmbZ-romTX9PFxO5HOjApkCyIjud5RzK1hZWpS3QkeA_kYAEg9DOc0vlqX1KKWAn_QufVC71HLTnWyQ" class="b-hbp-video b-uploaded" frameborder="0">
</iframe>
</div>
<p>
To make sure this wasn’t a hardware failure, I tried it on both my
units, and they both crash in the same way.
<p>
What on earth happened? Without knowing the contents of the ROMs I can
only theorize, but my best guess is that the action of loading the new
sheet clears caches — including whatever internal representation of the
formula the CPU was executing, causing it to either hit a bogus
instruction directly ($00 is invalid, for example) or a bogus code
pointer or token that leads it to a bogus instruction. An alternative
theory is that the load process alters the processor stack, causing the
CPU to hit a bad instruction returning from whatever routine handles
<tt>SheetIn()</tt>. Like the 6502, the 6800, 6801 and 6803 don’t trap
undefined opcodes (something I had to handle manually when
<a href="/2024/04/virtualizing-6502-with-6o6-and.html">virtualizing the
6502</a>), but the 6303 can, and has a specific vector for it.
<p>
Recall that during a normal power-down, the CPU checksums the ROM and
stores this value in its internal RAM before signalling the tape gate
array to put it in standby. Powering down the system would require the
CPU to send an explicit signal to the tape gate array, so either the
vector was rigged deliberately as a fail-safe on the assumption an
illegal instruction could never occur, or it merely ends up doing so
erroneously. Either way, because the system got powered down
<em>without</em> properly checksumming the ROM to its internal RAM, when
we power it on again the CPU sees the checksum is wrong and assumes
power was lost. This causes it to execute the cold-start routine and all
data is cleared.
<p>
This isn’t a “killer POKE” because there’s no (apparent?) harm done to
the hardware, but it’s still stupendously catastrophic. I suspect
Convergent actually knew about this because while <tt>SheetIn()</tt>
gets a brief mention in the Reference Guide it appears nowhere else in
the documentation. Its exact converse <tt>SheetOut()</tt> does (which
works fine), and our not-so-functional friend <tt>Keep()</tt> appears
many places, but <tt>SheetIn()</tt> goes otherwise completely
unacknowledged. Likely the problem was discovered too late in
development to rewrite the firmware and they just decided to mostly
pretend it didn’t exist.
<p>
But we know the regular manual Receive option works and can load entire
spreadsheets with formulas just the way we want them. This requires the
user to do some manual work when receiving generated data from a remote
system, but if we send the two DC2 characters while the Terminal is
active, we can immediately put the user into the Receive option and they
just have to pick the desired destination sheet from there. We won’t
know when they do, but we can warn them in the Terminal and implement a
reasonable delay before starting the transmission.
<p>
<p>So, to get the WorkSlate on the Internet, we’ll create a proxy that
turns Gopher menus into spreadsheets. No, stop laughing and hear me out.
Since Gopher is line by line, that corresponds very well to rows, we can
use the scrolling display to break up each line into full screen width
cells, and we can use the parts of the serial communications package
that <em>do</em> work to send commands to the proxy and wait for
results. This isn’t as clean as <tt>Keep()</tt> and <tt>SheetIn()</tt>
would have been, but we’ll get to keep our data, and we won’t crash
loading the very first site. To make the most of the WorkSlate’s limited
capacity, the proxy will manage history and keep an internal copy of the
current menu so that the WorkSlate only has to transmit short codes for
selection, and cap menus and documents to 128 lines and the 12,868 byte

<p>Since the Terminal is a critical part of this project (it’s how we
signal the user to start the Receive process), we’ll need it to be open
the whole time but we still want a decently sized content area to
actually see the Gopher site we’re visiting. Unlike the Calculator, the
Terminal’s on-screen footprint is adjustable from Options, SET UP,
Terminal, Display and then select # Lines. For these screenshots we’ll
reduce it to four lines instead of the default seven.</p>

<p>We start the proxy running on the connected computer, and then enter
the Terminal. The proxy sees the ENQ from the WorkSlate, sends a
linefeed to acknowledge, and then displays a prompt. These prompts are
how we synchronize the WorkSlate and the proxy.</p>

<p>When we press Do It, the proxy tells us transmission is imminent, and
sends DC2 DC2 to the Terminal. This opens the Receive option
automtically and we select the sheet we’ll use. I think most users can
handle pressing one button in five seconds. The transmission is sent and
the WorkSlate itself indicates success in the status row.</p>

The default menu is built-in to the proxy; you could call it your
bookmarks if you like. I just hardcoded
<a href="gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/">Floodgap’s Gopher</a> into it
since obviously I use my own stuff mostly. Each row of the returned
sheet starts with a single character column where the serial control
formula sits (or nothing, for info rows), then a 39-column cell, then
40-column cells up to a 159 character row.
<p>
While waiting for a selection, the proxy goes into a loop where it sends
a linefeed to the WorkSlate about once a second. This allows you to exit
the Terminal and then immediately return to it, like for example if you
were dealing in a document where you wanted more screen space to view
it.
<p>
<p>So that we don’t have to insert a complete request on every single
valid row, the proxy sorts the menu into lines and determines what to do
for each line. Each active line (i.e., each selectable option) has a
formula of the form
<tt>=Send(“###<sup>C</sup><sub>R</sub><sup>L</sup><sub>F</sub>”)+WaitFor(“<em>“)</tt>
(the CRLF is represented in tilde notation as <tt>~-</em>~</tt>, which
the WorkSlate translates to a real $0d $0a), where <tt>###</tt> is the
line number. We can have no more than 128 lines, so three digits is
sufficient.</p>

<p>When we’re ready to pick a menu option, we go to it with the cursor
diamond and press Special-Do It. The WorkSlate sends the number command
and line ending and waits for an asterisk in response. This is a signal
from the proxy that the menu is ready (or there was an error, which is
turned into a menu). The proxy backspaces over it, prints a new message
to the user to get ready to accept a new sheet, and sends DC2 DC2 to
open the Receive option. The new sheet is sent after the usual
five-second delay. The “Quit” option is implemented by sending a special
line “000” which causes the proxy to gracefully terminate, leaving the
Terminal open.</p>

<p>At the top of every menu is a Quit option, and if this isn’t the
root, a Back option above that. If I ever make the default menu into a
<em>real</em> bookmarks menu, it would make sense to put it in the
history as well. The WorkSlate lets you jump to the top of a sheet with
Shift-Up and to the bottom with Shift-Down, so I put those options at
the top for easy access. Backing up is implemented with a history
maintained by the proxy and sending special line number 999.</p>

<p>If you overflow a menu with too many rows, the last row is replaced
with a × and an “Out of rows” message (the same applies to “Out of

Gopher menu or text file got truncated.</p>

<p>
The Gopher proxy comes in two pieces:
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/workslate/tree/main/gopher.pl">the
Gopher proxy itself</a>, written in Perl, and
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/workslate/tree/main/serport.c">a C
program</a> that allows you to run the proxy over a given serial port
and implements the intercharacter delay. This descends from
<tt>usb2ppp</tt> in
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/burlap">BURLAP</a>, so it will
work on the same systems and accepts the same arguments (port speed,
path, program and arguments) even though the only supported speed
connected directly to the GPIO port is 9600bps. You start it with
something like <tt>./serport /path/to/your/port 9600 perl
./gopher.pl</tt> and then start Terminal on the WorkSlate. A running log
for debug purposes is written to standard error on the computer running
the proxy. Since the proxy feeds the WorkSlate all the sheet data it
needs, there’s no bootstrap you need to load on the device itself.
<p>
There’s a couple improvements I was mulling over, but this entry has
taken too much time and gone way too long, so I’ll ponder them later.
The first is tabbed browsing (I said stop laughing). Since you can
select which of the five sheets you want to load Gopher data into, you
should be able to run multiple sessions. However, because the proxy
maintains what it thinks the state of the current menu is, you can’t
load one menu in one sheet and another menu in another sheet because the
proxy doesn’t know which one is active. Solving this would require
tracking a much larger history and adding more state information to the
<tt>Send()</tt> string, maybe a hash key or something, but that would
also make the sheet data bigger and reduce the memory available, though
in practice I ended up exceeding the 128 row limit much more often than
the 12K memory one.
<p>
The second is accepting input from the user, on a first pass to allow
things like searching Veronica-2, but also to enter arbitrary hosts and
selectors without having to modify the proxy or manually hunt for the
right menu item. While <tt>SheetIn()</tt> exceeds uselessness verging on
active harm, <tt>SheetOut()</tt> works just fine, so we could
potentially send a very brief sheet with a form that the user fills out
and then runs a formula to ship it back. The problem here is the
Terminal: you can’t directly type into cells while it’s open. Either the
user would have to modify the cell with Options-CHANGE or exit the
Terminal and go back into it, neither catastrophic or particularly
onerous, but also making an already clunky experience worse. I suppose
the user could just type into the Terminal but the point is to make this
work with the WorkSlate’s native interface. It’s a hack already, though,
so I might implement input forms anyway just for fun in the future.
<p>
<h3>
Why there wasn’t a WorkSlate on every 1980s executive desk
</h3>
<p>
<p>By now you’re probably wondering why every boardroom denizen didn’t
have one of these things back in the day. Certainly for those who did
own one, they really seemed to like it. William H. “Bill” Millard, who
launched IMS Associates (builders of the <i>WarGames</i>-famous IMSAI
8080) and ComputerLand, one of the earliest retail vendors of the
WorkSlate, openly raved about his. In a May 1984 interview with
InfoWorld, he said, “The spreadsheet is the most exciting product I have
ever seen personally. … Listen, I’m bananas about this WorkSlate. I
carry it with me everywhere.” He further elucidated: “It’s no bigger
than a three-ring binder, it’s plastic, has a workable keyboard, 128 by
128 spreadsheet, memory, tape cassette, power backup, built-in modem.
You can sit on the airplane and be doing spreadsheets. To me this is a

Initial demand indeed got so high for the WorkSlate and its
manufacturing costs were so sizeable that Convergent management soon
started reconsidering the price point. The company announced a
“WorkSlate System” package deal in early 1984 for $1495 (in 2024 dollars
about $4500) with your choice of a MicroPrinter or CommPort, started
selling both peripherals for $395 each ($1200) and increased the base
price for the WorkSlate alone from $895 to $1195 ($3600). However,
likely due to other more general-purpose portables like the TRS-80 Model
100 and allies, sales had already slowed markedly by then, and the new
MSRPs eroded them further. By mid-year, while reviews still gave it
solid marks for its portability, internal software and ease of use, the
power-limited CPU and 16K RAM started becoming liabilities and the
keyboard was never popular. Convergent marketing managed to make the
WorkSlate “the official computer of the 1984 Democratic Party
Convention” at the Moscone Center in San Francisco and donated 57 units,
one for each delegation, but much like voters and Walter Mondale most of
them didn’t have any use for it. “The capacity is too limited for our
office,” complained the Oregon Democratic Party chair, and some
delegations simply raffled theirs off for funds. The Washington state
Democratic Party reportedly made $9000 from their own WorkSlate lottery.
<p>
Internally the company blamed Karen Toland, the manager who came up with
the consumer sales idea in the first place, and she departed the same
year. That spelled the end for any expansion of the “Ultra” line and the
company pivoted internal development to Unix systems back along their
vendor-first model. Convergent “paused” production of the WorkSlate in
July 1984 and officially halted it outright by August, provoking a
lawsuit from Oki Electronics who said Convergent had contracted to buy
253,000 circuit boards and only purchased 67,000 (making this figure the
absolute upper bound on total machines manufactured). Oki further
alleged that Convergent never paid for nearly $430,000 ($1.3m) worth of
boards that did get shipped and complained they had thousands of custom
boards in their warehouses they couldn’t sell to anyone else. Convergent
started marking down remainder units with deep discounts and even sold
them directly to Comdex attendees from their booth for $399 ($1200).
Reports from 1985 found WorkSlates in liquidation selling for $300 or
less.
<p>
In the end, Convergent and Oki settled out of court and the company
eventually took an $8.4 million ($25.2m) write-off on the product. If
the estimate of $3 million in WorkSlate sales in the November 5, 1984
<i>InfoWorld</i> is accurate, then Convergent could have sold no more
than a few thousand of them. Allen Michels left the company in 1985 and
Convergent never sold another direct consumer product again.
Disappointing sales of the AT&amp;T 7300 UNIX PC which its Special
Projects division developed caused further financial problems for the
company: by 1986 AT&amp;T had only sold 10,000 of the 50,000 systems
Convergent produced, and the 7300’s incompatibility with existing
software ironically made AT&amp;T’s earlier 6300 PC (a rebadged Olivetti
M24) a much better buy. While simultaneously upgrading the MegaFrame to
the CTIX-based MightyFrame with newer 68020 and 68030 CPUs, Convergent
returned to its x86 workstation roots with the 80386 Server PC which
could run CTOS, CTIX and MS-DOS. Its most noteworthy technical
achievement was being able to run CTIX and MS-DOS applications
simultaneously using the 80386’s virtual 8086 mode.
<p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither of these products appealed to their
traditional vendor base, who largely believed Convergent’s era as a
market driver had passed. Convergent tried to get into the networking
space by acquiring 3Com in March 1986 for $135 million ($385m),
<!-- Network World 3/31/86 --> but the deal was scuttled at the last
minute by 3Com shareholders who protested that the price undervalued the
company. Only Unisys, newly formed in 1986 when Convergent’s old partner
Burroughs bought out Sperry Rand, still regarded Convergent’s
technologies favourably and bought them out too as part of an expansion
strategy in 1988 for $350 million ($930m). All of Convergent’s former
intellectual property, including the WorkSlate, remains with Unisys
today.</p>

id="judge-rejects-trumps-request-to-intervene-in-hush-money-case">Judge
rejects Trump’s request to intervene in hush money case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A federal judge on Tuesday rejected Donald Trump’s request
to intervene in his New York hush money criminal case, thwarting the
former president’s latest bid to overturn his felony conviction and
delay his sentencing.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied Trump’s lawyers
permission to file paperwork asking the U.S. District Court in Manhattan
to take control of the case. He said they had failed to satisfy the
burden of proof required for a federal court to seize the case from the
state court where Trump was convicted in May.</p>
<p>The ruling leaves Trump’s case in state court, where he is scheduled
to be sentenced September 18.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers had sought to move the case to federal court so they
could then seek to have the verdict overturned and the case dismissed in
the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling granting ex-presidents
immunity from prosecution for official acts.</p>
<p>Hellerstein, who denied Trump’s request last year to move the case to
federal court, said nothing about the Supreme Court’s July 1 ruling
affected his “previous conclusion that the hush money payments” at issue
in Trump’s case “were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of
executive authority.”</p>
<p>Hellerstein sidestepped a defense argument that Trump had been the
victim of “bias, conflicts of interest, and appearances of impropriety”
at the hands of the judge who presided over the trial in state court,
Juan M. Merchan.</p>
<p>“This Court does not have jurisdiction to hear Mr. Trump’s arguments
concerning the propriety of the New York trial,” Hellerstein wrote in a
four-page decision.</p>
<p>Instead, Hellerstein noted, Trump can pursue a state appeal or, after
exhausting that path, seek review from the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“It would be highly improper for this Court to evaluate the issues of
bias, unfairness or error in the state trial,” Hellerstein wrote. “Those
are issues for the state appellate courts.”</p>
<p>Hellerstein’s ruling came hours after Trump’s lawyers filed paperwork
seeking his permission to pursue federal court intervention. Trump’s
lawyers had initially asked the federal court to step in last week, but
their papers were rejected because they hadn’t first obtained
Hellerstein’s permission to file them, as required.</p>
<p>Messages seeking comment were left with Trump’s lawyers and the
Manhattan district attorney’s office, which prosecuted the case.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day Tuesday, Manhattan prosecutors raised objections
to Trump ’s effort to delay post-trial decisions in the case while he
sought to have the federal court step in.</p>
<p>The Manhattan district attorney’s office argued in a letter to the
judge presiding over the case in state court that he had no legal
obligation to hold off on post-trial decisions and wait for Hellerstein
to rule.</p>
<p>Prosecutors urged the trial judge, Juan M. Merchan, not to delay his
rulings on two key defense requests: Trump’s call to delay sentencing
until after the November election, and his bid to overturn the verdict
and dismiss the case in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s
presidential immunity ruling.</p>
<p>Merchan has said he will rule September 16 on Trump’s motion to
overturn the verdict. His decision on delaying sentencing has been
expected in the coming days.</p>
<p>Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying business
records to conceal a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy
Daniels, whose affair allegations threatened to disrupt his 2016
presidential run. Trump has denied her claim and said he did nothing
wrong.</p>
<p>Falsifying business records is punishable by up to four years behind
bars. Other potential sentences include probation or a fine.</p>

Starlink will comply with judge’s order to block X in Brazil</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAO PAULO, brazil — Elon Musk’s satellite-based internet service
provider Starlink backtracked Tuesday and said it will comply with a
Brazilian Supreme Court justice’s order to block the billionaire’s
social media platform, X. </p>
<p>In a statement posted on X, Starlink said it will heed Justice
Alexandre de Moraes’ order despite him having frozen the company’s
assets. Previously, it informally told the telecommunications regulator
that it would not comply until de Moraes reversed course. </p>
<p>“Regardless of the illegal treatment of Starlink in freezing our
assets, we are complying with the order to block access to X in Brazil,”
the company statement said. “We continue to pursue all legal avenues, as
are others who agree that <span class="citation"
data-cites="alexandre">@alexandre</span>’s recent order violate the
Brazilian constitution.” </p>
<p>De Moraes froze the company’s accounts last week as a means to compel
it to cover X’s fines, which exceed $3 million, reasoning that the two
companies are part of the same economic group. Starlink filed an appeal,
its law firm Veirano told The Associated Press on August 3, but has
declined to comment further in the days since. </p>
<p>Days later, the justice ordered the suspension of X for refusing to
name a local legal representative, as required in order to receive
notifications of court decisions and swiftly take any requisite action —
particularly, in X’s case, the taking down of accounts.</p>
<p>A Supreme Court panel unanimously upheld the block on Monday,
undermining efforts by Musk and his supporters to cast the justice as an
authoritarian renegade intent on censoring political speech in
Brazil. </p>
<p>Had Starlink continued to disobey de Moraes by providing access,
telecommunications regulator Anatel could eventually have seized
equipment from Starlink’s 23 ground stations that ensure the quality of
its internet service, Arthur Coimbra, an Anatel board member, said on a
video call from his office in Brasilia. </p>
<p>The company has said it has more than 250,000 clients in Brazil, and
it is particularly popular in the country’s more remote corners where it
is the only available option. </p>
<p>Some legal experts questioned de Moraes’ basis for freezing
Starlink’s accounts, given that its parent company SpaceX has no
integration with X. Musk noted on X that the two companies have
different shareholder structures. </p>
<p>X has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to block users —
mostly far-right activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy
and allies of former President Jair Bolsonaro — and has alleged that de
Moraes wants an in-country legal representative so that Brazilian
authorities can exert leverage over the company by having someone to
arrest.</p>
