an open-source utility that lets you encrypt static HTML pages behind a
password.
</p>
<p>
Basically, my thought process went like this: Currently, most Fediverse
software is geared around short-form posts. There is software that lets
you publish long-form blog posts, but those tend to display in
followers’ timelines as a title and a link to the full post… which is
not particularly compatible with access control, as it currently stands.
And even if long-form posts did display in full, most client apps
<em>seriously</em> mangle any formatting, which is also undesirable for
a long post that probably does have formatting. So probably, what you
<em>really</em> want is for readers to have to click a link to the full
post, but <em>also</em> have to go through some kind of authentication
process.
</p>
<p>
A related thought was: well, actually, this blog runs on Hugo, not
anything ActivityPub. I would <em>probably</em> prefer to keep all my
writing (certainly my long-form writing) unified on a single website –
this website – and keep using the Fediverse as more of a supplementary
thing. I don’t think you can use StatiCrypt on actual posts processed
and managed by
Hugo,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
but you could certainly upload encrypted HTML files to your
<code>static/</code> subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
StatiCrypt even allows for shareable auto-decrypt links, so if you’re
actually <em>okay</em> with a shareable link existing for your post, you
could make use of that. Maybe you’d make a followers-only post on
Mastodon all like, “Hey, I have a new blog post up about what’s been
going on with me lately,” with an auto-decrypt link to your encrypted
HTML page. (Better, I guess, if you’re using software like GoToSocial
where you could restrict your posts to <em>mutual</em> followers, or
Bonfire which lets you define “circles” for sharing content to. But you
get what I mean.) Of course you can share links to such posts in any
other way you share links too, but <strong>be careful</strong> how you
do it. For example, Google in particular has been known to crawl emails
sent to or from Gmail addresses to add them to their search engine. You
do <em>not</em> want them to do that with an auto-decrypting link. You
also need to consider how much you trust your friends or family (and
<em>their</em> friends and family, and so on…) not to just spread links
to your post like wildfire.
</p>
<p>
StatiCrypt also lets you encrypt multiple pages with the same password,
so it’s not like you need to give all your friends a <em>new</em>
password for <em>each</em> post (unless you want to). You could even
have a nice little subdirectory, where all your encrypted posts are
listed on an <code>index.html</code> page for easy browsing. StatiCrypt
offers a “Remember me” feature so readers don’t have to re-enter the
password on every new page they navigate to (and your auto-decrypt links
can also be auto-“remember me”). You could just send, say, your mum a
link to your most recent protected post and she could catch up on all
the others without even being aware there <em>is</em> a password. And
you could have multiple subdirectories, with different passwords, for
different groups of friends who you want to see different selections of
posts (e.g. posts for family, versus posts you really do
<strong>not</strong> want family to see… 😂).
</p>
<p>
As I understand it, if you want to (or need to) invalidate all existing
“remember me” sessions and auto-decrypt links, but keep all passwords
the same for readers who actually know them, you could just change the
“salt” in the config file that posts have been hashed with, and
re-encrypt them. This could halt a “wildfire” situation stemming from an
auto-decrypt link in its tracks, although you’d probably want to get to
the bottom of how the post broke free of its intended audience in the
first place.
</p>
<p>
There are some caveats to StatiCrypt:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Each page can only be encrypted by a single password. You cannot revoke
passwords for individual readers if you decide you don’t trust them any
more. You can only re-encrypt the page with a different password, and
tell everyone <em>else</em> who you <em>still</em> trust what the new
password is. Or, if you’re paranoid, you could upload a separate copy of
the page for every single person who you want to read it, each encrypted
with a unique password. Then you could just delete the copy of the page
for the reader you lost trust in.
</li>
<li>
The strength of the encryption will depend on the strength of your
password. If you use a simple, easy-to-remember word, it could be easily
brute-forced by someone carrying out a dictionary attack. The longer the
password the better, and it should really be a random mix of letters,
numbers and symbols (like what a password manager would generate for
you). Of course this would make reading your posts more annoying for
non-tech-savvy readers if you don’t share an auto-decrypting link with
them, so I guess you need to weigh up how much you want specific people
to read your posts vs what risks there are in sharing an auto-decrypt
link. (Auto-decrypt links are still clearly less risky than weak
passwords, in my view.)
</li>
<li>
In theory, the “remember me” feature could lead to your encrypted posts
getting compromised if one of your readers’ browsers gets compromised,
because it stores a decryption key in their localStorage. You
<em>can</em> set a number of days for the “remember me” status to be
forgotten after, but it looks like that only affects anything if the
reader actually comes back to your site after that number of days is up
(and doesn’t immediately log in again) – the key won’t just auto-delete
after the set number of days. So, I guess if you think your posts are
<em>so juicy</em> that an attacker might compromise your readers’
browsers just to get at them, disable “remember me”.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Perhaps this post sounds a bit catastrophising, so just remember, even
in a closed system like LiveJournal which handled user authentication
for you, it was still possible for people to copy-paste or screenshot
your posts! Nothing in life is guaranteed. The website itself says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Disclaimer</strong> if you are an at-risk activist, or have
extra sensitive banking data, you should probably use something else!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Like, exercise some judgement about what you post, even in an encrypted
HTML page, OK? My goal here was to think of a way to do friends-only
posts, not doxx myself for shits and giggles just because “it’s
encrypted”. There is absolutely stuff sufficiently private that, if
necessary, you should send it to specific friends via an encrypted
messaging app, and not just post it on your website under password
protection. <em>However,</em> for friends-only posts on the open web, it
seems like this kind of encryption, with the ability to send
auto-decrypt links via more secure channels to your friends (so they
don’t actually have to fuck around remembering or storing passwords),
seems like a good solution.

I guess this sounds like a strange contradiction in terms. By “open web”
I mean “using open protocols, like ActivityPub, or just ordinary
individual HTML/CSS/JS websites, not locked in a silo like Facebook”.
Obviously not literally “open access to

Praises ‘Herculean Efforts’ to Rebuild Site of Ohio Train
Derailment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EAST PALESTINE, Ohio — President Joe Biden on Friday surveyed the
federal cleanup in East Palestine, Ohio, more than a year after an
explosive fire from a derailed train carrying hazardous chemicals, and
saw up close the lingering hostility from victims still angry that he
waited so long to visit.</p>
<p>The White House has said Biden was waiting for the right moment to
visit. The mayor invited him.</p>
<p>Addressing residents, Biden said he wanted them to understand “that
we’re not going home, no matter what, until this job is done, and it’s
not done yet,” speaking of the federal government. He did not explain
why it took more than a year for him to visit, nor did he address the
community’s collective hurt.</p>
<p>He praised what he said were “Herculean efforts” by the federal,
state and local governments to clean up after the derailment and fire
and, announced federal grants from the National Institutes of Health to
study the short- and long-term effects of what happened and blamed the
derailment on greed by the railroad company, Norfolk Southern.</p>
<p>The derailment didn’t have to happen, Biden said.</p>
<p>“While there are acts of God, this was an act of greed that was 100%
preventable,” Biden said after local officials briefed him on the
cleanup and took him to the site of the derailment. “Let me say it
again, an act of greed that was 100% preventable.”</p>
<p>Connor Spielmaker, a spokesperson for Norfolk Southern, responded
without addressing Biden’s claims of corporate greed. Spielmaker said
the company promised to fix things in East Palestine and “we’re keeping
our promises.”</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board said last spring in its
preliminary report that the derailment was likely caused by an
overheating bearing on one of the railcars.</p>
<p>In his remarks, Biden also stressed that the federal government is
holding Norfolk Southern accountable. He called on Congress to pass
legislation sponsored by Ohio’s two U.S. senators that would require
stronger protective measures for trains carrying hazardous material.</p>
<p>He also asked Congress to make sure that no one will have to pay
federal taxes on any compensation they receive from Norfolk
Southern.</p>
<p>Signs of the community’s still-hurt feelings were evident. Some
people shouted profanity as Biden’s motorcade whisked him into town from
an earlier stop in Darlington Township, Pennsylvania, where he greeted
local officials and first responders. Others held derogatory signs,
including one that named the president’s late son, Beau, who died of
brain cancer.</p>
<p>Biden arrived at the derailment site and saw what resembled a
construction site. Rigs, trucks, generators and covered metal tanks
resembling above-ground swimming pools dotted the landscape. Local
officials, including the mayor, briefed the president.</p>
<p>Mayor Trent Conaway, who does not support Biden, addressed the
president, saying: “Your long-awaited visit to our village today allows
us to focus on the things we agree with. Acknowledging this disaster
should never have happened. Address the long-term health concerns and
the economic growth of the village, and ensure this never happens again
to another community.”</p>
<p>As Biden visited, between 50 and 75 people held a counter-rally in
support of former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination. Trump won nearly 72% of the vote in
Ohio’s Columbiana County, which includes East Palestine. He visited soon
after the derailment.</p>
<p>Mike Young, the rally’s coordinator, described the grass-roots event
as “anti-Biden.” He said he delivered water to the community after the
disaster and said the president should have been an immediate presence
on the ground.</p>
<p>“The sentiment from residents has been: ‘Where were you a year ago?’”
Young said. “Too little, too late. And now Biden shows up at election
time.”</p>
<p>Misti Allison, who lives with her family about a mile away from the
derailment site, said she was really glad that Biden kept his promise to
visit, especially one year in. The family evacuated the night after the
accident and returned a week later. She said she worries about their
exposure to the chemicals.</p>
<p>“Nobody asked for this to happen and we need to know that the federal
government has our backs,” Allison said.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency engaged in an intense cleanup and
says the community’s air, water and soil are now safe.</p>
<p>The agency removed more than 176,000 tons of hazardous waste. More
than 49 million gallons of water, rainfall and snowmelt were removed or
treated. The federal agency is also collecting 2,500 samples to ensure
that the cleanup has succeeded.</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern said it has spent more than $1.1 billion in its
response to the derailment. Since the fire began on February 3, 2023,
and caused hazardous chemicals to mix, the company says it has invested
$103.2 million in the community, including $21 million distributed to
residents.</p>

Cyberattack Hit 2 Iranian Military Ships in Red Sea</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — The United States carried out a cyberattack earlier this
month against two Iranian military ships as part of its multipronged
response to the killing of three U.S. soldiers by Iran-backed proxies,
VOA has confirmed. </p>
<p>A U.S. official, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity
because of operational sensitivities, said the MV Behshad was one of the
targeted ships The Iranian military ship was collecting intelligence on
vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. A source with knowledge of
the cyberattack said an Iranian frigate was also targeted.</p>
<p>The U.S. official said the cyberattack on the MV Behshad was to
inhibit its ability to share targeting information with the
Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen who have been firing missiles into
international shipping lanes.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, White House national security adviser Jake
Sullivan warned of potential “unseen” retaliatory efforts “to send a
very clear message that when American forces are attacked, when
Americans are killed, we will respond, and we will respond
forcefully.”</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder declined to comment
to VOA about the attack, which an official said occurred more than a
week ago.</p>
<p>NBC News first reported the attack on the Iranian spy ship on
Thursday but did not report the cyberattack on the Iranian frigate.</p>
<p>U.S. officials do not typically disclose covert operations, including
cyberattacks.</p>
<p>In addition to the cyberattacks, the U.S. this month struck
Iranian-backed proxies in seven locations across Syria and Iraq on
February 2.</p>
<p>A day later, U.S. and allied forces struck dozens of Houthi targets
at 13 locations in militant-controlled areas of Yemen.</p>
<p>A U.S. drone strike on February 7 in Baghdad killed a Kataib
Hezbollah commander who the U.S. said was “responsible for directly
planning and participating in attacks on U.S. forces in the region.”</p>
<p>There has not been an attack on U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria or Jordan
since February 4, according to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria and Jordan were attacked by Iran-backed
militants more than 160 times since mid-October, shortly after Hamas’
assault on Israel. Most of the attacks caused few to no injuries or
damages, but an attack in late January at the Tower 22 base in Jordan
killed three American service members and wounded dozens of others.</p>
<p>Iranian-backed Houthi militants, however, have continued with their
series of attacks targeting international shipping lanes in the Red Sea
and the Gulf of Aden. </p>
<p>The Houthis say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in
the Gaza Strip. According to a U.S. defense official, the Houthis have
attacked or threatened commercial vessels 48 times since
mid-November.</p>
<p>The U.S. has carried out self-defense strikes against Houthi drones
and missiles that have been fired into international shipping lanes or
that were poised to conduct attacks. The U.S. and its partners also
carried out attacks in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen last month,
which they said took out key weapons used in the Houthis’ targeting of
international ships.</p>

Reinstates Sanctions on Yemen’s Houthi Rebels, Effective Friday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>state department — The United States has reinstated sanctions on
Yemen’s Houthi rebels effective Friday, following their continued
attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, endangering maritime
security. </p>
<p>The Houthis were first designated as a terror group three years ago
and subsequently delisted due to humanitarian concerns. The relisting
follows repeated demands from the U.S. and other countries for the
Houthis to stop firing on commercial shipping. </p>
<p>Those demands have been ignored, and attacks have continued despite a
series of airstrikes by the U.S. and Britain aimed at taking out radar
systems and launch sites used in the attacks. </p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, a missile was launched from Yemen, hitting the
port side of the India-bound Panamanian-flagged M/T Pollux, which was
transporting crude oil. The extent of the damage is presently unclear,
but the M/T Pollux is continuing its journey south under its own
power. </p>
<p>Houthi leaders have declared that the group will persist in its
attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians, as long as Israel continues
what the group termed its crimes against them. </p>
<p>A spokesperson from the U.S. State Department noted that on January
17, Washington announced its intention to relist the Houthis as a
Specially Designated Global Terrorist, or SDGT, after 30 days, giving
the Iran-backed rebels “the opportunity to scale down their attacks” and
“to minimize de-risking across the industry.” </p>
<p>The spokesperson also accused Iran of aiding the Houthis in
destabilizing the region. </p>
<p>“Iran has been deeply involved in planning the operations against
commercial vessels in the Red Sea. This is consistent with Iran’s
long-term materiel support and encouragement of the Houthis’
destabilizing actions in the region. Houthi forces have employed various
Iranian-origin missiles and uncrewed aerial vehicles against military
and civilian targets throughout the region,” the spokesperson said. </p>
<p>U.S. officials said they have made concerted efforts to mitigate the
impact of this designation on the Yemeni people. Washington has actively
engaged the shipping industry, financial institutions, banks and
humanitarian aid organizations to ensure comprehensive understanding of
the broad exemptions associated with this designation. </p>
<p>In the waning hours of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s
administration in January 2021, the Houthis were designated as both an
SDGT and a foreign terrorist organization, or FTO.  </p>
<p>In February 2021, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken delisted the
Houthis as both a foreign terrorist organization and as specially
designated global terrorists.  </p>
<p>This action was taken as the Biden administration aimed to facilitate
a diplomatic resolution to the long-running civil war between the
internationally recognized government of Yemen, based in the southern
port city of Aden, and the Houthis, whose capital is Sanaa.  </p>
<p>Additionally, the delisting aimed to make it easier to deliver food
and humanitarian aid to the people of Yemen. </p>
<p>The two designations carry distinct penalties. Being named as a
specially designated global terrorist empowers the U.S. Treasury
Department to disrupt terrorists’ access to funds within the United
States and across the international financial system.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, designation as a foreign terrorist organization by
the State Department prohibits anyone from providing the group with
“material support,” including fighting for the group, or providing
financial assistance or training. </p>
<p>Members of foreign terrorist organizations who are not U.S. citizens
are typically banned from entering the United States, except where there
is a rare and high-level decision otherwise. The Houthis have not been
relisted as an FTO at this time. </p>
<p>U.S. defense officials said the Houthis have launched dozens of
attacks on commercial vessels and naval vessels since mid-November,
impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50 countries.</p>

<p>On April 4, 1968, when I learned with the rest of the world that
Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated, I immediately thought that
the civil rights movement, which King had led, had just been set back by
fifty years. I was wrong about that. It ended right then (check that

<h2 id="oddµ-namespaces-and-live-updating">2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces
and live updating</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a slow morning. I had my two cups of coffee, ate my pancakes with
plum jam, spent time online reading Mastodon, talked to my wife about
wannabe-axe murderers on Swiss trains, looked up stuff about
<a href="https://www.tax-the-rich.eu/">taxing the rich</a>…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve been working on Oddmu again. My goal is to be able to reproduce the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/">Campaign Wiki</a> setup:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
people can get a “space” for their site by signing up in some way
</li>
<li>
they can make changes to the look and feel of their site (change the
headers, footers, colours, i.e. make changes to both the HTML template
and the CSS)
</li>
<li>
feeds, list of changes and all that are limited to their site
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using Oddmu would also result in the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
sites are no longer publically editable (which isn’t a requirement for
such spaces like role-playing game campaigns)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Oddmu now has the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
when editing pages in a subdirectory, the <code>index</code> and
<code>changes</code> page in the same directory are updated (instead of
the root directory)
</li>
<li>
when HTML templates exist in the same directory, those are used instead
of the templates in the root directory
(e.g. <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ</a>)
</li>
<li>
when uploading a HTML template, it is loaded immediately (no more server
restart)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once I had this implemented using a library that watches the filesystem
for changes, I realized that I could use the same feature to index new
pages. This brings me closer to having online and offline writing
feature equivalence: Using the web site to create a page should be
equivalent to writing a page elsewhere and uploading it to the site via
rsync. (Offline you can use the <code>oddmu notify</code> command to add
links to <code>index</code>, <code>changes</code> and hashtag pages.)
</p>
<p>
I think I’m getting close!
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a>
</p>
<p>
Also, code complexity is through the roof, now. All the global maps
aren’t thread-safe so they need mutexes. There’s a weird Heisenbug I
have where I run the test suite and then <code>view.html</code> is gone.
The next test run then fails, of course. Thinking it was related to the
order of tests, I started running <code>go test -shuffle on</code> and
found a plethora of <em>other</em> bugs. And I’ve seen at least two
occasions where I noticed the disappearing <code>view.html</code> bug,
noted the shuffle id, reran the test with that id, got the error again,
tried for a third time, and then tests passed. So… it must be a race
condition of some sort.
</p>
<p>
How aggravating.
</p>
<p>
Maybe something got lost, with that last set of changes.
</p>
<p>
I do feel, however, that I’ve found a lot of bugs… Just now, for
example, to help prevent Oddmu from showing any directories or files
with a path segment starting with a period…
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-02-14</strong>. I need to think about an archive handler
that allows you to get a zip file for the current directory. (I guess
zip files are more accessible than .tar.gz files? Like, for Windows and
macOS…)
</p>
<p>
And the archive needs to take
<a href="2024-02-14-oddmu-bug">ODDMU_FILTER</a> into account!
</p>
<p>
Done. ✔️

<h2 id="why-ford-and-gm-are-scared-of-chinas-electric-cars">Why Ford and
GM Are Scared of China’s Electric Cars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQzNTM3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODU1Njg1Nn0.wUwZBrxlv574sTtc8jpgyTkrHCuJJAeSq2szK2_YjXU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
On the surface, it should be a triumphant moment for the Big Three, the
triumvirate of traditional American automakers made up of Ford, General
Motors, and Stellantis.
</p>
<p>
They survived the pandemic and inflationary surge of the early 2020s,
and they settled their
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/what-does-the-uaw-want-exactly-and-what-does-that-mean-for-electric-cars" target="_self">labor
issues with the United Auto Workers</a>. They even had a pretty good
2023, financially. Even as interest rates reached multi-decade highs,
which should normally discourage big-ticket car and truck purchases,
Ford and General Motors booked $4 billion and $12 billion in profit,
respectively — slightly below 2022’s levels but more than might have
been reasonably expected. Stellantis, which owns the Jeep and Dodge
brands,
<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/chrysler/2024/02/15/stellantisrecord-profit-revenue-earnings-2023-fourth-quarter/72603529007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted
a record profit</a>.
</p>
<p>
Consumers and businesses are still buying millions of full-size pickups,
SUVs, and vans each year. If interest rates start to fall this summer,
and the economy holds out, then 2024 could be even bigger. Yet the
companies are clearly increasingly worried. And they have good reason to
be. They are entering a critical period: a time when they must make the
EV transition, or die trying.
</p>
<p>
For the past decade, Detroit has supported itself partly off profits
earned from selling SUVs, crossovers, and pickup trucks to North
Americans. It essentially delegated the market for small cars and trucks
to foreign automakers operating in the United States, like Toyota and
Honda. You
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/708856/ford-small-car-evs-profitable/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">haven’t
even been able to buy</a> a Ford-badged sedan or hatchback in the United
States since the pandemic, as the automaker has winnowed its car
offerings here down to the Mustang.
</p>
<p>
That model worked in the post-Great Recession period when gasoline was
generally cheap and the global auto market was stable and growing. But
now those profits are coming under threat. The primary driver of that
threat is the rise of Chinese automakers, who are chomping away at the
Big Three’s shrinking market share in China and around the world.
</p>
<p>
In the coming weeks, more and more attention will be paid to this
important shift. The Biden administration is
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-explores-raising-tariffs-chinese-evs-wsj-2023-12-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reportedly
so alarmed</a> at the ability of Chinese-made cars to enter American
markets that it is considering hiking tariffs on EVs and other
clean-energy products further.
</p>
<p>
Here are three important aspects of this story to understand:
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>The EV transition is suddenly struggling in Detroit
</h3>
<p>
Each of the Big Three finds itself in a slightly different position in
the EV transition than it expected to be — and while none of them is
quite as weak as it may look at first, no automaker is doing
particularly well.
</p>
<p>
Ford, for instance, seems to have nailed it with the Mustang Mach E, a
family-friendly crossover that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hyundai-motor-group-kia-motors-ioniq-5-ev-6" target="_self">has
outsold any individual electric model</a> from Kia or Hyundai. But it
has struggled to convince truck buyers to try out its all-electric F-150
Lightning, and it has slowed its EV investment plans. The company
<a href="https://robertbryce.substack.com/p/ford-lost-47b-on-evs-last-year-or" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lost
$64,731 on each electric car</a> it sold last year — $4.7 billion on EVs
overall — meaning that its electric division only survives because of
its ample profits from selling gas-burning SUVs and trucks.
</p>
<p>
General Motors sells the Chevrolet Bolt, the country’s best-selling EV
that isn’t a Tesla. But it has struggled to roll out its new Ultium
battery platform, which it hopes will be the basis of all its new
electric cars. It recalled
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/01/03/more-bad-buzz-for-chevy-blazer-evs-software-glitches-doors-that-fly-open/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
Chevrolet Blazer EV</a> after test units
<a href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/701169/2024-blazer-ev-stranded-broken/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">literally
left reviewers stranded</a> by the side of the road.
</p>
<p>
Stellantis — the trans-Atlantic fusion of the Fiat, Dodge, Jeep, and
Peugeot brands — is arguably in the best shape of the three, although
you could argue that it barely counts as a member of the Big Three
anymore. (It is headquartered in the Netherlands.) It
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/16/this-legacy-automaker-says-it-just-turned-a-profit-on-evs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">turned
a profit</a> on its electric cars last year, but almost all of that came
from European brands that aren’t offered here. Its American business
remains
<a href="https://www.cbtnews.com/stellantis-full-year-profits-rise-but-business-stays-sluggish-in-u-s/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slower</a>
and more pickup-dependent.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Chinese cars are cheaper …
</h3>
<p>
Since the pandemic, China’s position in the global auto market has
completely changed. Last year, the country
<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/electric-shock-interpreting-chinas-electric-vehicle-export-boom" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exported
more cars than it imported</a> for the first time ever. Although most of
its auto exports are gas-burning vehicles — it has filled a gap in the
Russian car market left behind by western automakers’ post-Ukraine
withdrawal — electric cars make up a larger and larger share of its
production.
</p>
<p>
The star of China’s EV market is BYD, which passed Tesla last year as
the world’s No. 1 producer of electric cars. By leveraging China’s
domination of the battery industry and facility with electronics
manufacturing, BYD can sell EVs for under $12,000.
</p>
<p>
While BYD hasn’t started to sell cars in the United States yet, it is
getting closer to the market. On Tuesday, the head of BYD’s operations
in Mexico
<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Tesla-rival-BYD-weighs-EV-plant-in-Mexico" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
Nikkei</a> that the company is exploring opening a new factory in that
country.
</p>
<p>
That could get BYD’s cars into the U.S. under the umbrella of the
U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Then, even if the federal government
found a way to block the domestic sale of BYD cars, the company could
still cut into U.S. automakers’ market share in Mexico and potentially
Canada, which are both major markets for American manufacturers.
</p>
<p>
Even without North American factories, Chinese EVs have started to
dribble into the United States. Volvo’s small new electric SUV,
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=volvo+new+ev+cheap+ev+&sca_esv=3f909ef51a3c5598&ei=qATNZej7CKHb5NoP_K2q-AM&ved=0ahUKEwjo77qiuauEAxWhLVkFHfyWCj8Q4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=volvo+new+ev+cheap+ev+&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiFnZvbHZvIG5ldyBldiBjaGVhcCBldiAyCBAAGIAEGKIEMggQABiABBiiBDIIEAAYgAQYogQyCBAAGIAEGKIESKkKUFtY2AhwAXgBkAEAmAHBA6AB7hSqAQkwLjEuMi4yLjO4AQPIAQD4AQHCAgoQABhHGNYEGLADwgIFEAAYgATCAgoQABiABBiKBRhDwgIGEAAYFhgewgIFECEYoAHCAgUQIRifBcICBBAhGBXiAwQYACBBiAYBkAYI&sclient=gws-wiz-serp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
XC30</a>, is manufactured in China and will debut at $34,950 this year.
That’s roughly the same price GM hopes to achieve with
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24070558/gm-chevy-equinox-ev-price-range-trim-model-date" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its
American-made Chevrolet Equinox EV</a>, a similarly sized SUV, which is
due to go on sale later this year.
</p>
<p>
That Volvo is able to achieve price parity with General Motors is itself
a testament to the Chinese sector’s advantage, as the price factors in
the U.S.’s
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-administration-explores-raising-tariffs-chinese-evs-wsj-2023-12-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">25%
tariff</a> on car imports from China.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>… in part because they’re priced to move
</h3>
<p>
What’s tricky is that while China is objectively better than the rest of
the world at building electric cars, its companies are also helped by a
slowdown in its domestic economy.
</p>
<p>
China is suffering a multi-year economic slowdown due to the slow
deterioration of its real estate and construction sectors. The slower
domestic economy means that these products are cheaper. More than 70% of
China’s exports have fallen in cost over the past year,
<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Trade/China-exports-deflation-as-home-demand-for-steel-and-autos-low" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to Nikkei Asia</a>, a phenomenon that economists describe as “exporting
deflation.” In part because President Xi Jinping
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/communist-party-priorities-complicate-plans-to-revive-chinas-economy-84a156d7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
been so reluctant</a> to adopt policies that would increase domestic
consumption, the country’s most sure-fire method of generating economic
growth has been to export more products abroad.
</p>
<p>
Many of those products — such as EVs, solar panels, and batteries — are
essential to global decarbonization. As the historian Adam Tooze
<a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-carbon-notes-10-in-china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has
written</a>, clean energy is now
<a href="https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-carbon-notes-10-in-china" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
primary driver of economic growth</a> in China. As Chinese companies
search for foreign markets to sell their climate-friendly products, they
are driving prices down for those products globally. That could
potentially undercut other automakers’ ability to find a path to making
profitable EVs.
</p>
<p>
This is the difficulty of thinking through this issue: The Big Three
have made legitimate missteps, Chinese firms have a legitimate advantage
over American and European firms, <em>and </em>Chinese firms can enjoy
lower costs due to problems in the Chinese economy. How do you sort
through those factors? Whatever path you choose, one message emerges:
The Big Three can only be protected from the EV revolution for so long.
One way or another — whether by the law of the land or the law of the
markets — it’ll come for them.

id="trump-must-pay-354.9-million-barred-from-ny-business-for-3-years">Trump
Must Pay $354.9 Million, Barred From NY Business for 3 Years</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Donald Trump must pay $354.9 million in penalties for
fraudulently overstating his net worth to dupe lenders, a New York judge
ruled on Friday, handing the former U.S. president another legal setback
in a civil case that imperils his real estate empire.</p>
<p>Justice Arthur Engoron also banned Trump from serving as an officer
or director of any New York corporation for three years.</p>
<p>Engoron canceled his ruling from September ordering the dissolution
of companies that control pillars of Trump’s real estate empire, saying
on Friday that this was no longer necessary because he is appointing an
independent monitor and compliance director to oversee Trump’s
businesses.</p>
<p>In the ruling, Engoron wrote that Trump and the other defendants in
the case “are incapable of admitting the error of their ways.”</p>
<p>“Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on
pathological,” Engoron wrote. “Instead, they adopt a ‘See no evil, hear
no evil, speak no evil’ posture that the evidence belies.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James
accused Trump and his family businesses of overstating his net worth by
as much $3.6 billion a year over a decade to fool bankers into giving
him better loan terms.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyer Alina Habba said in a statement that the ruling was a
“manifest injustice” and “culmination of a multi-year, politically
fueled witch hunt” against him.</p>
<p>“This is not just about Donald Trump — if this decision stands, it
will serve as a signal to every single American that New York is no
longer open for business,” Habba said, adding that she plans to
appeal.</p>
<p>Trump and his adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric, were defendants in the
case. Don Jr. and Eric Trump were each ordered by the judge to pay $4
million.</p>
<p>Trump has denied wrongdoing and called the case a political vendetta
by James, an elected Democrat.</p>
<p>The civil fraud case could deal a major blow to Trump’s real estate
empire as the businessman turned politician leads the race for the
Republican nomination to challenge Democratic President Joe Biden in the
Nov. 5 U.S. election.</p>
<p>During defiant and meandering trial testimony in November, Trump
conceded that some of his property values were inaccurate but insisted
banks were obligated to do their own due diligence.</p>
<p>Engoron criticized Trump for his behavior during his trial testimony
and wrote that the testimony hurt his cause.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump rarely responded to the questions asked, and he
frequently interjected long, irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond
the scope of the trial,” the judge wrote. “His refusal to answer the
questions directly, or in some cases, at all, severely compromised his
credibility.”</p>
<p>Trump could be required to deposit his portion of the full judgment
plus interest during an appeal, which is standard practice in similar
cases.</p>
<p>Trump could also post a smaller amount with collateral and interest
by securing a type of loan called an appeal bond. But he may have
trouble finding a willing lender after Engoron found he lied to banks
about his wealth.</p>
<p>It is unclear how much access to cash Trump has, and estimates of his
fortune vary, with Forbes pegging his net worth at $2.6 billion. Trump
testified in an April deposition that he had roughly $400 million in
cash.</p>
<p>Friday’s ruling came after a contentious three-month trial in
Manhattan. The case was decided by the judge without a jury.</p>
<p>Trump used his occasional court appearances as impromptu campaign
stops, delivering incendiary remarks to reporters and insisting his
enemies are using the courts to prevent him from retaking the White
House.</p>
<p>Trump is leading by a wide margin in the race for the Republican
nomination despite a host of other legal troubles.</p>
<p>He is under indictment in four criminal cases, including one in New
York related to hush money payments he made to a porn actress ahead of
the 2016 election. The judge overseeing that case on Thursday set a
March 25 trial date over the objections of Trump’s lawyers, who sought
to delay it due to Trump’s crowded legal and political schedule.</p>
<p>Trump has also been charged in Florida for his handling of classified
documents upon leaving office and in Washington and in Georgia for his
efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.</p>
<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty in all four cases.</p>

How America’s oligarchs lull us with the be-your-own-boss fairy tale
(permalink) Capitalism is a vibes-based system. Sure, we all know about
Keynes’s “Animal Spirits” that see “bulls” and “bears” vying to set the
market’s future, but beyond that, there’s just a hell of a lot of
narrative. Writing for The American Prospect, Adam M Lowenstein reviews
two books that tell the histories of the stories that are used to sell
American capitalism to the American people – the stories that turn
workers into “temporarily embarrassed millionaires”:
https://prospect.org/culture/books/2024-02-16-stories-corporations-tell-williams-waterhouse-review/
The first of these books is Taming the Octopus: The Long Battle for the
Soul of the Corporation, by Kyle Edward Williams, a kind of pre-history
of “woke capitalism”: https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393867237 Taming is
a history of the low-water marks for Big Business’s reputation in
America, and how each was overcome through PR campaigns that declared a
turning point in which business leaders would pursue the common good,
even at the expense of their shareholders’ interests. The story starts
in the 1950s, when DuPont and other massive firms had gained a
well-deserved reputation as rapacious profit-generation machines that
“alienated workers and pushed around small businessmen, investors, and
consumers.” This prompted DuPont’s PR chief, Harold Brayman, to write a
memo called “The Attack on Bigness,” where he set out a plan to sell
America on a new cuddly image for corporate giants. For Brayman, the
problem was that corporate execs were too shy about telling their social
inferiors about all the good that businesses did for them: “The
businessman is normally reluctant to talk out loud. He frequently shuns
the spotlight and is content with plugging his wares, not himself.” This
was the starting gun for a charm offensive by American big business that
included IBM president Thomas Watson Jr (“I think there is a world
market for about five computers”) going on a speaking tour organized by
McKinsey &amp; Co, where he told audiences that his company’s billion
dollar annual profits had convinced it to assume “responsibilities for
the broader public welfare.” This set the template for a nationwide
mania of “business statesmanship” that Fortune celebrated with an
editorial announcing “a great transformation, of which the world as a
whole is as yet unaware” that put the “profit motive…on its last leg.”
Fortune then spent the next seventy years recycling this announcement,
every time the tide went out on business’s popularity. In 2019, Fortune
platformed IBM president Ginni Rometty for an announcement that the
company was orienting its priorities to the public good: “It’s a
question of whether society trusts you or not. We need society to accept
what it is that we do.” The occasion for Rometty’s quote was a special
package on the Trump tax-cuts, a trillion-dollar gift to American big
business, which lobbyists for the Business Roundtable celebrated with an
announcement that American capitalism would now serve “stakeholders”
(not just shareholders). Fortune celebrated this “change” as
“fundamental and profound.” Fast forward five years and corporate
leaders are still telling stories, this time about “stakeholder
capitalism” and “ESG” – the dread “woke capitalism” that has right-wing
swivel-eyed loons running around, hair afire, declaring the end of
capitalism. For Williams and Lowenstein (and me), all this ESG, DEI, and
responsible capitalism is just window dressing, a distraction to keep
the pitchforks and torches in people’s closets, and to keep the
guillotines in their packaging. The right-wing is doing a mirror-world
version of liberals who freak out when OpenAI claims to have built a
machine that will pauperize every worker – assuming that a PR pitch is
the gospel truth, and then repeating it in criticism. Criti-hype, in
other words:
https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5
Think of ESG: the right is freaking out that ESG is harming shareholders
by leaving hydrocarbons in the ground to appease climate-addled
greenies. The reality is that ESG is barely disguised greenwashing, and
it’s fully compatible with burning every critter that died in the
Mesozoic, Cenozoic, and lo, even the Paleozoic:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/15/sanctions-financing/#profiteers The
reason this tactic is so successful is that Americans have also been
sold another narrative: that American problems are solved by American
individuals as entrepreneurs and businesspeople, not as polities or as
members of a union (let alone the working class!). This is the subject
of the second book Lowenstein reviews, One Day I’ll Work for Myself: The
Dream and Delusion That Conquered America, by Benjamin Waterhouse:
https://wwnorton.com/books/one-day-ill-work-for-myself/ A keystone of
American narrative capitalism is the idea that the USA is a nation of
small businesspeople, Jeffersonian yeoman farmsteaders of the US
economy. But even a cursory examination shows that the country is ruled
– economically and politically – by very large firms. Uber sells itself
as a way to be your own boss (“No shifts. No boss. No limits.”) – even
though it’s a system where the app is your boss, and thanks to that
layer of misdirection, Uber gets to be the worst conceivable boss, while
its workers have no recourse in labor law:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men
In labor fights, Uber represents itself as the champion of innumerable
“small businesspeople” who drive its unlicensed taxis. In consumer
protection fights, Amazon claims to be fighting for “small
businesspeople” who sell on its platform. In privacy fights, Facebook
claims to represent “small businesspeople” who buy its surveillance
advertising. But large firms are actively hostile to small firms, seeing
them as small-fry to be rooked or destroyed (recall that when Amazon
targeted small publishers for bankruptcy-level discounts, they called
the program “The Gazelle Project” and Bezos told his executives to
tackle these firms “the way a cheetah pursues a sickly gazelle”).
Decades of this tale have produced “a profound shift from a shared
belief that individuals might come together to solve problems, into a
collective faith in individual effort.” America’s long love-affair with
rugged individualism was weaponized in the 1970s by corporations seeking
to shed their regulatory obligation to workers, customers, and the
environment. As with Big Tech today, the big business lobby held up
mom-and-pop businesses as the true beneficiaries of deregulation, even
as they knifed these firms. A telling anecdote comes from someone who
worked for the Chamber of Commerce’s magazine Nation’s Business: when
this editor pointed out that many of the magazine’s subscribers were
small businesspeople and asked if they could start including articles
relevant to mom-and-pops, the editor in chief said, “Over my dead body.”
The neoliberal era has been an unbroken string of platitudes celebrating
the small business and policies that annihilate their chances against
large firms. Ronald Reagan’s dewy-eyed hymns to American
entrepreneurship sounded nice, but what matters is that he attempted to
abolish the Small Business Administration and refused to address the
20,000 attendee “White House Conference on Small Business.” In the years
since, American has sacrificed its small businesses while pulling out
all the stops – bailouts and tax cuts and elite bankruptcy – to keep its
largest firms growing. New regulations like Dodd-Frank were neutered in
the name of saving mom-and-pop shops, even though the provisions that
were cut already exempted small businesses. Today, millions of Americans
are treading water in a fetid stew of LLC-poisoning, rise-and-grind,
multi-level-marketing, dropshipping and gig-work, convinced that the
only way to get a better life is to pull themselves up by their
bootstraps:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/10/declaration-of-interdependence/
Narrative does a lot of work here. The American economy runs on bubbles,
another form of narrative capitalism. Take AI, a subject I sincerely
wish I could stop hearing about, not least because I’m certain that 99%
of that thinking is being wasted on whatever residue remains after the
bubble pops:
https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/
AI isn’t going to do your job, but its narrative may convince your boss
to fire you and replace you with a bot that can’t do your job. Like what
happened when Air Canada hired a chatbot to answer customer inquiries
and it started making shit up about bereavement discounts that the
company later claimed it didn’t have to honor:
https://bc.ctvnews.ca/air-canada-s-chatbot-gave-a-b-c-man-the-wrong-information-now-the-airline-has-to-pay-for-the-mistake-1.6769454
This story’s been all over the news for the past couple of days, but so
far as I’ve seen, no one has pointed out the seemingly obvious inference
that this chatbot probably ripped off lots of people. The victim here
was extraordinarily persistent, chasing a refund for 10 weeks and then
going to the regulator. This guy is a six-sigma self-advocate – which
implies a whole bell-curve’s worth of comparatively normal people who
just ate the shit-sandwich Air Canada fed them. The reason AI is a
winning proposition for Air Canada isn’t that it can do a customer
service rep’s job – it can’t. But the AI is a layer of indirection –
like the app that is the true boss of Uber drivers – that lets Air
Canada demoralize the customers it steals from into walking away from
their losses. Nevertheless, the narrative that AI Will Change Everything
Forever is powerful – more powerful than AI itself, that’s for sure.
Take this Bloomberg headline: “Nearly all wealth gained by world’s rich
this year comes from AI”:
https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/nearly-all-wealth-gained-by-world-s-rich-this-year-comes-from-ai-124021600006_1.html
Dig in and you find even more narrative. The single largest beneficiary
of AI stock gains last year was Mark Zuckerberg ($161B!). Zuck is
American Narrative Capitalism’s greatest practitioner: the guy who made
billions peddling a series of lies, from “pivot to video” to
“metaverse,” leaping from one lie to the next just ahead of the mass
stock-selloffs that wiped out lesser predators. The Narrative Capitalism
Cinematic Universe has a lot of side-plots like AI and entrepreneurship
and woke capitalism, but its main narrative arc was articulated, ad
nauseum, by Margaret Thatcher: “There is no alternative.” This is the
most important part of the story, the part that says it literally can’t
be otherwise. The only way to organize society is through markets, and
the only way to organize markets is to leave them alone, no matter how
much suffering they cause. This is a baffling story, because it’s so
easily disproved. Zuck says the only way to have friends is to let him
surveil you from asshole to appetite, even though he once ran Facebook
as the privacy-forward alternative to MySpace, and promised never to spy
on you: https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876 Likewise, the
business leaders – and their chorus of dutiful Renfields – who insist
that monopoly is the natural and inevitable outcome of any market
economy just handwave away the decades during which anti-monopoly
enforcement actually kept most businesses from getting too big to fail
and too big to jail. I’m no champion of market efficiency – especially
not as the best and final arbiter of social and economic questions – but
when I hear my comrades repeating the Thatcherite claims that all forms
of capitalism necessarily degrade into monopolistic quagmires, that
there is no alternative, it sounds like more criti-hype. This is a
frequent point of departure during discussions of enshittification: some
people dismiss the whole idea of enshittification as “just capitalism.”
But we had decades of digital services that either didn’t degrade, or,
when they did, were replaced by superior competitors with a minimum of
switching costs for users who migrated from the decaying incumbent to
greener pastures. The reality is that while there are problems with all
forms of capitalism, there are different kinds of capitalist problems,
and some forms of capitalism are less harmful to working people and more
capable of enacting and enforcing sound policy than others.
Enshittification is what happens when the constraints on the worst
impulses of companies and their investors and managers are removed. When
a company doesn’t have competitors, when it can capture its regulators
to trample our rights with impunity, when it can enlist those regulators
to shut down would-be competitors who might free us from its “walled
garden,” and when it can fire any worker who refuses to enact harm upon
the users they serve, then that company will enshittify:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel
A company can be made to treat you well, even if it is run by a wicked
person who sees you as a mark to be fleeced – that mustache twirler just
has to be constrained – by competition, regulation, self-help and labor.
He may still hate you and wish you harm, but he won’t be able to act on
it. As MLK said: It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me,
religion and education will have to do that, but it can restrain him
from lynching me. And I think that’s pretty important also. And so that
while legislation may not change the hearts of men, it does change the
habits of men. And we see this every day. Come see me on tour!

Suggests Russia Can Be Talked Out of Launching New Anti-Satellite
System</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Russian plans to launch a new, space-based
anti-satellite weapon system that could potentially wreak havoc on Earth
are not set in stone, according to U.S. President Joe Biden, who
suggested Friday that there was a still a chance to persuade Moscow to
change course.</p>
<p>Word of the new Russian threat began spreading Wednesday after a top
U.S. lawmaker issued a statement warning of “a serious national security
threat,” and demanded Biden declassify the intelligence so the American
public, Congress and U.S. allies could better formulate a response.</p>
<p>Suggestions the new Russian system made use of either nuclear power
or nuclear weapons then sparked additional concern.</p>
<p>But Biden said such fears were overblown and that the danger was not
imminent.</p>
<p>“There is no nuclear threat to the people of America or anywhere else
in the world with what Russia is doing at the moment,” Biden told
reporters at the White House.</p>
<p>“There is no evidence that they have made a decision to go forward
with doing anything in space,” he said.</p>
<p>“We found out there was a capacity to launch a system into space that
could theoretically do something that was damaging,” Biden added.
“Hadn’t happened yet, and my hope is it will not.”</p>
<p>‘Private engagement’</p>
<p>White House officials on Thursday described the Russian
anti-satellite system as a capability that had not yet been deployed,
and they pushed back against demands to release additional details.</p>
<p>“The intelligence community has serious concerns about a broad
declassification of this intelligence,” said national security
communications adviser John Kirby. “They also assess that starting with
private engagement, rather than immediately publicizing the
intelligence, could be a much more effective approach.</p>
<p>“We’ve reached out to the Russian side, but we have not secured
actual conversations at this point,” Kirby added.</p>
<p>A report in Russia’s Tass news agency Friday, citing a Kremlin
spokesperson, denied Washington had tried to talk to Russian
officials.</p>
<p>Russia on Thursday dismissed the U.S. allegations as a “malicious
fabrication,” with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accusing Washington
of a ruse to get U.S. lawmakers to approve a bigger budget.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies have been warning for years that Russia
and China have been pursuing “a full range of anti-satellite weapons,”
noting that the development and use of such systems “could degrade U.S.
intelligence-gathering abilities.”</p>
<p>One of the most recent declassified U.S. intelligence assessments
warned that Moscow continues to “field new anti-satellite weapons to
disrupt and degrade U.S. and allied space capabilities.”</p>
<p>Russia “is developing, testing and fielding an array of
nondestructive and destructive counterspace weapons — including jamming
and cyberspace capabilities, directed-energy weapons, on-orbit
capabilities and ground-based ASAT [anti-satellite] capabilities,” the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence wrote in its 2023
Worldwide Threat Assessment report.</p>
<p>Space-based advantages</p>
<p>Some analysts have likewise cautioned that any Russian advanced
anti-satellite technology could have far-ranging impacts on the U.S.,
and U.S. troops in particular.</p>
<p>“Our military gets a lot of advantage from our space-based
capabilities — things like GPS that allow us to navigate and conduct
precision operations, put bombs exactly on targets very effectively,”
said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, who focuses on defense and space policy.</p>
<p>“[If] an adversary can take space away from us and deny us the
ability to use those space systems, they would negate one of our biggest
advantages,” Harrison told VOA.</p>
<p>But U.S. lawmakers briefed on the intelligence late Thursday voiced
confidence in the U.S. approach.</p>
<p>“We all came away with a very strong impression that the
administration is taking this very seriously and that the administration
has a plan in place,” said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike
Turner, whose statement sparked much of the tumult.</p>
<p>“We look forward to supporting them as they go to implement it,” he
added.</p>

Rekindles Sister City Ties as Relations Remain Strained</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Austin, Texas — As Washington and Beijing move cautiously to mend
frayed relations, China is working to boost people-to-people ties, which
saw a dramatic decline during the COVID pandemic.</p>
<p>Since last fall, China has hosted mayors from more than two dozen
sister cities amid a renewed push to rebuild contacts with the 284
cities and states that Beijing says it maintains. The push kicked off
with a visit by California Governor Gavin Newsom to China and began
picking up steam around the time of last year’s meeting between
President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Xi, the Chinese president, is also spearheading an effort to bring
50,000 students to China over the next five years.</p>
<p>Last month, a group of high school students from Muscatine, Iowa,
visited China. Another group from Tacoma, Washington, will visit its
sister city of Fuzhou in southern Fujian province in March.</p>
<p>Xi’s push for more sister-city engagement comes as the number of
students studying in China dropped to just 350 in 2022 compared to
around 15,000 six or seven years ago. The number increased slightly to
700 in 2023.</p>
<p>It also comes as foreign businesses in China are struggling with
slumping confidence, a slowing economy and unpredictable official
behavior including raids and the expansion of an anti-spy law.</p>
<p>Some worry that the push is part of an effort to regain control of
the narrative and draw attention away from bigger concerns such as
China’s military aggression toward Taiwan or in the South China Sea, or
its human rights abuses and handling of Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong
Kong.</p>
<p>Others see it as a necessary part of keeping the lines of
communication open and building understanding.</p>
<p>In October of last year, Kim Norton, the mayor of Rochester,
Minnesota, joined one of the first groups to visit. He told VOA that
memories of the trip are still fresh in his mind, and that many sister
city relationships were rekindled during the visit.</p>
<p>“It was a great experience. Everyone we met was very nice to us,”
Norton said. “I really enjoyed meeting the Chinese people, experiencing
Chinese cities, and understanding the local culture and issues related
to climate change.”</p>
<p>Others who participated in the visit included Jim Brainard, the
retired mayor of Carmel, Indiana; Barbara Buffaloe, mayor of Columbia,
Missouri; Lee Harris, mayor of Shelby County, Tennessee; Chokwe Lumumba,
mayor of Jackson, Mississippi; and Robyn Tannehill, mayor of Oxford,
Mississippi.</p>
<p>During the visit, which was organized by the United States Heartland
China Association, a sister city contract was signed twinning Carmel,
Indiana, with Xiangyang in Hubei Province.</p>
<p>The mayoral delegation visited five cities: Hong Kong, Wuhan,
Nanjing, Suzhou and Shanghai; test-drove electric vehicles produced by
China Lantu Company; met with students from Wuhan University; watched a
performance of the Suzhou Symphony Orchestra; and participated in the
China International Import Expo.</p>
<p>Jessica Bissett, director of leadership programs at the National
Committee on U.S.-China Relations, said local government level exchanges
have become a new trend. When U.S.-China relations are tense, state and
provincial governments, especially municipal governments, have more
leeway to decide what kind of exchanges and cooperation are best for
local economic development.”</p>
<p>Governors, mayors, their biggest responsibilities are to grow their
economies and to make sure that their constituents have enough jobs and
that they can have the best quality of life as possible,” said
Bissett.</p>
<p>“So … if U.S.-China economic relations would benefit their
constituents, their towns, their states or their cities, then they’re
going to look into potential opportunities.”</p>
<p>She said that for Chinese local governments, last year’s economic
downturn has also created incentive for such exchanges. She added that
the U.S. State Department is also happy to see this kind of active
exchange between local governments.</p>
<p>“The State Department now has a special unit that is focusing on
sub-national relations,” Bissett added. “I think they would be
encouraging things that are happening right now.”</p>
<p>VOA’s Mandarin service reached out to the Chinese Embassy in
Washington for comments but did not receive a response.</p>
<p>Given the heightened national security concerns in both countries,
pushing forward local government level cooperation has its
challenges.</p>
<p>Li Jing, director of an investment institution in Shandong Province
who requested that a pseudonym be used so he could speak more freely
with VOA Mandarin, said that before the U.S.-China trade war, he often
helped to invite U.S. local government officials, entrepreneurs,
university scholars, and well-known young entrepreneurs visit Shandong
Province.</p>
<p>He said he would help Chinese to make capital investments in American
companies, and American companies to establish operations in China and
participate in project development. Such delegations used to be held
several times a year, he said.</p>
<p>Due to the U.S.-China trade war and the pandemic, such delegations
were suspended for several years. Last year, he wanted to restart such
activities but encountered many difficulties.</p>
<p>“Some [U.S.] companies were worried that after taking Chinese
capital, their market development in the U.S. and other Western
countries will be hindered, and they may even be sanctioned by the
Western governments,” he said. “Some American university professors are
also worried about the consequences of cooperation with China. It may
affect their work in the U.S.”</p>
<p>He said that although most Americans he contacted were still
interested in the Chinese market, they were also worried about the
national security risks of cooperating with the Chinese government or
accepting Chinese capital.</p>
<p>Gordon Chang, a distinguished senior fellow at the Gatestone
Institute think tank, believes that such exchanges should be
stopped.</p>
<p>“China’s Communist Party is determined and relentless. It uses every
point of contact with America to take down our country. That means every
point of contact, no matter how innocent looking, is dangerous to us,”
Chang said.</p>
<p>Some have already responded to those concerns.</p>
<p>Shortly after retired Carmel Mayor Jim Brainard visited China and
signed a new sister city relationship with Xiangyang, the city’s new
mayor Sue Finkham announced this month that it was withdrawing its
membership from the United States Heartland China Association or USHCA,
citing concerns about the group’s close ties to the Chinese Communist
Party. Carmel, however, has not ended its sister city relationship with
Xiangyang.</p>
<p>USHCA declined to respond to several requests from VOA for
comment.</p>
<p>Mayor Norton said that while international politics was not the focus
of his visit to China, the delegation cooperated with the U.S. State
Department and the U.S. Embassy in China, understood the matters that
needed attention in international relations, and ensured that the
relationship between the local governments of the two countries would
not cause conflicts at the level of national interests.</p>
<p>Bissett said local governments should be cautious about cooperation
in high-tech and intellectual property fields. However, she said the two
countries shouldn’t use national security as an excuse to scrutinize
everything.</p>
<p>“We need to give people more credit when they choose to engage with
China and go on these trips and have faith in them that they can make
the distinction for themselves,” she said.</p>

Chicken Named Potato Will Teach Your Kids About Climate Change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQ4OTI1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNzYwMjIxMH0.-CVT-jYv0l6RiIC_DydxvOFmvs0C-Q8q9CvAhTRGNE8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
If I told you there was a chicken named Potato who was going to teach
our kids about climate change, would you think I was kidding? Either
way, I’m here to inform you that
<a href="https://futurechicken.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Future
Chicken</em></a>, an “ECOtainment platform” co-created by Catherine
Winder and Annabel Slaight, launched last year, including original
content like a TV show that airs on CBC and YouTube, games, and a
podcast, all aimed at warding off climate doom and instead highlighting
climate solutions.
</p>
<p>
Winder and Slaight have, to put it mildly, impressive
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0805234/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resumes</a>,
with Slaight having been an executive producer of <em>The Big Comfy
Couch</em> and Winder a force behind multiple <em>Angry Birds</em>
movies. The show’s premise is fun, and was
<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90990565/a-former-lucasfilm-exec-created-this-time-traveling-chicken-to-help-kids-cope-with-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">actually
thought up by kids</a>. The main character is a chicken (named Potato)
from the year 2050, a time when climate change has seemingly been
solved. She travels back and forth between the future and the present,
sometimes talking about the solutions of her time.
</p>
<p>
As one of Heatmap’s resident
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/rise-of-the-climate-dads" target="_self">Climate
Dads</a>, the question of how and when I should talk to my kids about
climate change actually vexes me a lot, so I’m always open to new media
on the subject. A couple years ago, being a millennial parent, I reached
out to one of my own childhood bards (and longtime climate advocate)
Raffi, of “Baby Beluga” fame, for
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fun-stuff/when-and-how-should-you-talk-to-your-kids-about-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">his
advice</a>.
</p>
<p>
Here’s what he told me:
</p>
<blockquote>
Wait. Wait until the child asks you about climate change. And then,
depending on the child’s age, your response can be brief and not
alarming. You don’t want to get into a long climate-data talk. Keep it
brief, don’t say too much. If and when the child returns for more, then
say more. We want to comfort, not add to the child’s anxiety. Comfort
comes in knowing that many are engaged in climate action, and we’re in
this together.
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>Future Chicken</em>, from what I’ve seen, follows similar guidance.
In one episode, Future Chicken introduces us to climate scientist
Katharine Hayhoe (for a quick second her on-screen name reads Katharine
Play-Dough), a “planet protector who helped us build a better future.”
She talks about how individual actions like reducing food waste or
walking or biking to school affect others. “When we talk about them with
other people,” she says, “that’s how we catalyze change.”
</p>
<p>
When I showed <em>Future Chicken</em> to my kids, my seven year old son
was most drawn to an episode featuring a video game influencer named
Mackenzie Turner, who emphasized trying to get outside and away from
screen time. (The show playfully called it getting more “green time.”)
As an avid videogamer, my son didn’t quite see eye to eye with her on
this one, but it led to a good conversation about the importance of
nature.
</p>
<p>
My almost-five year old daughter really liked the episode with Robin
Greenfield, a climate activist famous for trying to reduce waste in
every way possible, which has resulted in stunts like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Greenfield" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wearing
all the trash</a> he produced in a month.
</p>
<p>
I asked my daughter what she learned from the episode.
</p>
<p>
“I learned that there are leaves that grow out of your butt.”
</p>
<p>
“That doesn’t happen,” I gently explained. “The guy talked about wiping
his butt with leaves.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s what I meant,” she said.
</p>
<p>
<em>Future Chicken</em> is no <em>Bluey</em>, a.k.a. the
“<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/05/bluey-best-kids-tv-show.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">best
kids show of our time</a>.” But it did keep my kids’ attention for the
three 11-minute episodes we watched.
</p>
<p>
The real test will be if they ask to watch it tomorrow – or if my
daughter asks me to fetch her some fresh leaves.

Virginia Senator Manchin Won’t Seek US Presidency in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin said Friday that he is
not running for president, according to his spokesperson Jon Kott. For
months Manchin, a centrist Democrat, had been flirting with a campaign
that threatened to complicate the 2024 presidential race. </p>
<p>Manchin announced his decision in a speech at West Virginia
University billed as “The Future of American Politics.” </p>
<p>He often bucked his party’s leadership and while considering a run
for the presidency had said he thought it would be clear by March if
there was a path for a third-party candidate this year. </p>
<p>Manchin is not running for reelection in 2024. His Senate seat in a
heavily Republican state is expected to be a prime pickup opportunity
for the GOP.</p>
<p>The West Virginia senator has had talks with No Labels, a centrist
group that has been looking into fielding a possible centrist
ticket. </p>
<p>Democrats feared a Manchin presidential bid would likely peel off
moderate voters as its looking more likely that November’s election will
present a rematch between President Joe Biden and former President
Donald Trump.</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
A blogroll is a list of links to other blogs or websites that a blogger
enjoys or finds relevant. It’s often found in the sidebar of a blog. The
purpose of a blogroll is to share recommendations with readers and to
connect with the broader blogging community. By including a blogroll, a
blogger can provide their audience with access to additional resources,
opinions, or communities that share similar interests. It can also serve
as a tool for networking and building relationships with other bloggers,
through mutual linking or acknowledgment. Blogrolls were more prominent
in the early days of blogging but can still be found on many sites
today.

<p>
Microsoft, the owner of Xbox, announced on Thursday that it’s bringing
several previously Xbox exclusive games to rival consoles. More could be
coming. Playstation and Nintendo have historically used games that can
only be played on their gaming consoles to help drive console sales. So
what’s behind the shift in strategy for Xbox? Also on the show: closer
examinations of wholesale prices and the Biden administration’s latest
attempt at student loan cancellation.

<h2 id="ui-fstatesⁿ">UI = f(statesⁿ)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
“UI is a function of state” is a pretty popular saying in the front-end
world. In context (<em>pun intended</em>), that’s typically referring to
application or component state. I thought I’d pull that thread a little
further and explore all the states that can effect the UI layer…
</p>
<h2>
First-party application states
</h2>
<p>
Every application whether it’s a to-do list or a shopping cart or some
radically complex app will have some state. State isn’t uniform and
typically exists at a variety of different levels. We’ll start at the
top and drill down…
</p>
<h3>
Global state
</h3>
<p>
Data stores and feature gating that typically happens at the application
level.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Stores - different locations for storing data
<ul>
<li>
Application store - Redux, Vuex, Mobx, Signals
</li>
<li>
Browser store - localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, IndexedDB
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Data - different types of global data
<ul>
<li>
Access control data - authentication tokens, paid/unpaid, geolocated,
age, verified, member, etc.
</li>
<li>
User data - name, icon, etc
</li>
<li>
Collections - e.g. list of posts
</li>
<li>
Session data
</li>
<li>
… etc
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Page/Component state
</h3>
<p>
Vince Speelman’s wonderful
<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-nine-states-of-design-5bfe9b3d6d85">Nine
States of Design</a> do a great job summing up all the states that a
page or component might exist in.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Nothing - An empty element
</li>
<li>
Loading - A <code>fetch</code> is happening
</li>
<li>
None - No items returned
</li>
<li>
One - A single item comes back
</li>
<li>
Some - A few items comes back
</li>
<li>
Too Many - Too many items, need pagination (or similar)
</li>
<li>
Incorrect - An error occurred
</li>
<li>
Correct - A success happened
</li>
<li>
Done - The operation finished
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Vince’s list is perfect to me and keeps being relevant after all these
years, I would add two items.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Custom states - Any bespoke or custom states relevant to your
application
</li>
<li>
Realtime multi-player event mesages - Picture the constant updating
state in a chat app or realtime stock ticker. Stored at the component
level or thrown into global state.
</li>
<li>
Scroll-position - Pages and components often need to know if they’re
scrolled in or out of viewport.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In my experience both the page and each component will contain some
mixture of these states as well as being reactive to global state
changes.
</p>
<h3>
Element state
</h3>
<p>
Individual elements can (and will) have their own states. At this layer,
features of HTML, CSS, and ARIA start to reveal themselves.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor">Cursor</a>
state
<ul>
<li>
<code>default, pointer, wait, text, move, grab, crosshair, zoom-in,
zoom-out</code>, … etc
</li>
<li>
Custom cursors
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry/isIntersecting">IntersectionObserverEntry</a>
<ul>
<li>
isIntersecting = true, false
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Stacking context
<ul>
<li>
<code>z-index</code>
</li>
<li>
Layer
<ul>
<li>
Root
</li>
<li>
<code>::backdrop</code>
</li>
<li>
Top
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Attribute states - states reflected in HTML
<ul>
<li>
Visibility = <code>hidden, visible</code>
</li>
<li>
Language = <code>dir, lang</code>
</li>
<li>
Functionaltiy = <code>contenteditable, draggable, invoketarget</code>

states</a> -
<a href="https://css-tricks.com/user-facing-state/">user-facing
states</a> reflected in ARIA
<ul>
<li>
<code>aria-current</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>aria-expanded</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>aria-pressed</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>aria-hidden</code>
</li>
<li>
… etc
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Second-party user (or device) states
</h2>
<p>
The user of the application and their device, peripherals, and browser
have a lot of say in how the final application renders. This is by
design and
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">built
into the foundations of the web</a>.
</p>
<h3>
Language and localization
</h3>
<p>
Surprise! Not all users live in US-West-2.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Text direction = <code>ltr, rtl</code>
</li>
<li>
Writing mode = <code>horizontal-tb, vertical-lr, vertical-rl</code>
</li>
<li>
Distance to server/CDN (latency)
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
Words are short (e.g. Chinese)
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Device constraints
</h3>
<p>
A user’s device has a lot of variation and customization and may be your
biggest unknown bottleneck for rendering to glass.
</p>
<ul>
<li>

Viewport = <code>height, width, initial-scale,
horizontal-viewport-segments, vertical-viewport-segments,
viewport-segment-width, viewport-segment-height</code>, … etc.
</li>
<li>
Environment contstants = <code>safe-area-inset-<em></code>,
<code>titlebar-area-</em></code>, <code>keyboard-inset-*</code>(e.g,
<a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-notch-and-css/">iPhone Notch</a>,
rounded corners,

</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Modalities
</h3>
<p>
Users aren’t uniform in how they interact with their devices and may be
using one or any combination of inputs and outputs all at once.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Inputs
<ul>
<li>
Mouse = one-button, two-button, mousewheel, trackball, touchpad,
high/low DPI

Vibration
</li>
<li>
RSS?
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Browser states
</h3>
<p>
Finally, a user’s browser choice and preferred plugins determines a lot
about how they experience (or would prefer to experience) your UI and
your application can be responsive to some of those preferences.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
User preferences
<ul>
<li>
prefers-color-scheme = light, dark, forced-colors
</li>
<li>
prefers-reduced-motion = reduce, no-preference
</li>
<li>
prefers-reduced-transparency = reduce, no-preference
</li>
<li>
user zoom = 100% to 400%
</li>
<li>
text size = small to x-large
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

<ul>
<li>
Camera = true, false
</li>
<li>
Microphone = true, false
</li>
<li>
Geolocation = allowed, not allowed, only while using the app
</li>
<li>
Notifications = true, false
</li>
<li>
File access = true, false
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Plugins
<ul>
<li>
Ad blockers - UBlock, Safari ITP, Ghostery, … etc
</li>
<li>
Custom plugins/Boosts
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
User states
</h3>
<p>
Thus far we’ve talked about technology, now let’s consider the actual
human being at the other end of the transaction. A user’s physical or
mental state impact their cognitive or literal bandwidth to enjoy your
experience.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/">Having
an emergency/crisis</a>
</li>
<li>
Cognitive impairment
</li>
<li>
Permanently or temporarily disabled
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory/">“Out
of spoons”</a>
</li>
<li>
Inside or outside
</li>
<li>
On a plane or train
</li>
<li>
In the city or in the woods
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Third-party service states
</h2>
<p>
Third parties have an outsized impact on the user experience of a UI.
</p>
<h3>
Availability/Status
</h3>
<p>
The status/availability/uptime of other servers is the biggest surface
area for failure for a UI.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Server hardware status = online, offline, partial availability
</li>
<li>
Database status = online, offline, transaction locked
</li>
<li>
API status = online, offline, partial availability
</li>
<li>
Web font service = online, offline, partial availability
</li>
<li>
DNS status = may take up to 72 hours to resolve
</li>
<li>
Package dependencies = working, broken, malicious injection,
protestware, … etc
</li>
<li>
Asset delivery and caching status
<ul>
<li>
Cloudflare
</li>
<li>
S3
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Script injections
</h3>
<p>
Third-party script injections are the biggest contributor to performance
degradation on a UI. Some services even take over the user experience of
an application. This is often out of your control.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Analytics/tracking services
</li>
<li>
User session recording services
</li>
<li>
A/B test injections
</li>
<li>
Instructional overlays
</li>
<li>
Accessibility overlays
</li>
<li>
Third-party authentication (OAuth) services
</li>
<li>
Captcha/verification services
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You haven’t truly lived life until one of these unchecked services takes
down an application.
</p>
<h2>
There’s more to UI than just state…
</h2>
<p>
I’m sure I’ve forgotten whole categories of state. I haven’t even gotten
into the hundreds of CSS properties and the thousands of values and
their potential conflicts. I didn’t talk about the intricacies of
styling form controls or building dropdowns with the required ARIA
property combinations. I didn’t touch on
<a href="https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-definitions/">the
decision matrix required to put an image on the page</a>. Nor does this
get into <a href="https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD">setting all the
proper tags in the <code>head</code></a>
<a href="https://rviscomi.github.io/capo.js/">in the right order</a>.
Nor does this discuss
<a href="https://microformats.org/">microformats</a> for SEO or all the
code you need to properly setup a UI to send analtyics data.
</p>
<p>
In closing, hire people who are good at UI.

<p>date: 2024-02-16, updated: 2024-02-16, from: RAND blog</p>
<p>Israel reportedly has offered to allow Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and
other Hamas commanders safe passage into exile in return for the release

Last week, the Federal Communications Commission banned robocalls that
use voices generated by artificial intelligence. This comes after New
Hampshire voters received phone calls during that state’s primary, which
used AI to imitate President Joe Biden and discourage people from
heading to the polls. Today, we hear how generative AI is being used to
manipulate and what consumers can do to protect themselves. Also: a
disappointing snapshot of the manufacturing economy.

<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is the 25th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where
I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today
we have Peter Rukavina and his blog, <a href="https://ruk.ca">ruk.ca</a>
</p>
<p>
I don’t remember how I stumbled on Peter’s blog to be honest with you.
It might have been on Hacker News or maybe someone sent it to me. I
remember loving its very personal nature. His blog is the type of
personal blog I enjoy the most: just an endless stream of content
spanning across an array of topics. Also, he has quite the history on
that site considering the oldest post is from 1999 but the archive
contains also content from the early to mid 90s as well as some pieces
of digital media from the 60s! That’s an eternity in the digital world.

<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I am an inveterately curious person, with a lifelong passion for words
(writing them, reading them, typesetting them, binding them together).
In the mid-1980s, after an aborted attempt at college, where I never
found my mojo, I set off on a career as a coder and a graphic designer.
I apprenticed in the composing room of a daily newsletter. I designed
posters for a modern dance company. I learned to design books. I created
database systems for apartment buildings, for a palæontologist, and for
a tire store.
</p>
<p>
When the web came along in the 1990s, I embraced it, and was part of the
very early efforts in organizing and displaying government information
to the public, along the way becoming interested in open source software
and open data, and becoming an advocate for both. Professionally, I
settled into a position maintaining the infrastructure of
<a href="http://almanac.com/">Almanac.com</a>, the website of <em>The
Old Farmer’s Almanac</em>, a platform that gave me great latitude to
explore whatever the web frontier of the moment was, working with a
venerable publication to help it chart its course beyond print.
</p>
<p>
About a decade ago, while continuing digital work, I started to become
interested in letterpress printing—an embrace of print in its purest
form. I run a small letterpress shop, Queen Square Press, based in a
church basement, and let my creativity take me where it leads me,
producing posters, broadsides, cards, and ephemera, mostly to scratch my
own itches.
</p>
<p>
This year, after thinking about it for a long time, I decided to step
away from digital work altogether. It was a hard decision: I’d been
working with a great team, on interesting projects, for more than 25
years. I was well-paid, in control of my own schedule. I had no
complaints. But I knew in my heart of hearts that I wanted to try
something else. What? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
This decision to transition can, in part, be explained by my being four
years a widower, being the father of a 23 year old autistic trans woman,
and, recently, burgeoning stepfather to a delightful 12 year old, and
partner to her mother, a fascinating, creative, woman who challenges and
delights me every day. All of this change swirling around me has opened
me up and allowed me to relax into new possibilities.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
In 1999 I found myself writing an “about” page for my tiny web business,
then called Digital Island. I watched myself falling into familiar
“about page” tropes — “Digital Island is a leading provider of
innovative solutions for… blah blah blah…” — and thought, inspired by
early bloggers who were emerging around the time, perhaps I’d, instead,
create a place to write about myself, my interests, my work, my life. I
wrote a tiny CMS in PHP, and made
<a href="https://ruk.ca/content/digital-island-gets-reinvented">my first
post</a> in May 1999, a simple announcement that I was changing my
company name.
</p>
<p>
I started off slowly, making only 13 posts the first year, but gradually
developed an approach, and a style, and a notion of “the kinds of things
I blog about” (travel, personal projects, my family, local businesses,
my eccentricities), to the point, almost 25 years later, where it’s
become interwoven into my emotional life, a way of organizing my
thoughts about things, of explaining things to <em>myself</em> by way of
explaining them to my readership.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I generally write in real time: an idea occurs to me, and the idea takes
on a life of its own, gets “called to be written about,” and I try to
carve out the time to do so right away. I don’t find the process of
writing onerous; generally words flow out of me, and while I will go
back and edit the words, finessing the meaning, correcting errors, what
emerges is generally fairly close to what I wrote down in the first
place.
</p>
<p>
I write a lot of posts via email, a capability that has allowed me to
take my writing out of “sitting in front of a laptop” and, really,
<em>anywhere</em> I’m struck. Writing on a tiny iPhone SE isn’t the best
and most natural environment (though voice-to-text helps), but the
benefit of being able to “strike while the iron is hot” outweighs the
fussiness of the tool. These days perhaps half of what I write is on the
phone.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My blogging flourishes, as does my life, when I’m on the road. I love
writing about my travels, of seeing new things, meeting new people. And
so “away” is the ideal creative environment. That said, as I’ve been
remaking my days, stepping away from an office with a desk and a chair,
what “away” means can be as close as the public library or coffee shop
up the street.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
After running my home-brew PHP blogging engine for many years, I
eventually migrated to using Drupal, and have been using Drupal ever
since. This was partly for professional reasons —
<a href="http://almanac.com/">Almanac.com</a> is a Drupal site, so I’ve
wanted to “eat my own dogfood” on my personal site — and partly because
I found Drupal a nice balance of canned and extendable.
</p>
<p>
My ability to blog-by-email is enabled by
<a href="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</a>, which fires a web hook
upon receiving email to a dedicated email address; the web hook fires
some custom code on my server that uses the Drupal API to create a new
post.
</p>
<p>
The site is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, running MySQL and Apache.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
As I’m stepping away from coding professionally, I find myself at a
crossroads: I’ve always believed deeply in owning and managing as much
of my own technology stack as possible (I only migrated away from
running my own mail server in recent memory), and I like the flexibility
of “I’ll just code up a Drupal module to do that.”
</p>
<p>
But I’m trying to spend <em>less</em> time at the keyboard, and things
that fascinated me at one point I now find technical drudgery, to the
point where I might go looking for a home for my writing that I don’t
need to care and feed so frequently, a place where I can just focus on
writing.
</p>
<p>
But rewinding back to the beginning, no, I don’t think I’d do anything
differently. I’ve loved my blog, and writing, for a long time; it’s part
of me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
In the early days of Google Adsense
<a href="https://ruk.ca/content/content-targetted-google-ads">I ran ads
on the blog</a>, and because the web was smaller, and I had a deep
archive with good organic SEO, I made good money doing so.
</p>
<p>
But I gradually became uncomfortable with my own words, often deeply
personal words, being surrounded by ads for who-knows-what, and so
eventually turned off the ads entirely, and I’ve been ad-free (and
analytics, and tracking free) ever since. I feel confident in this
decision.
</p>
<p>
I generally read <em>other</em> blogs with an RSS reader (currently
<a href="https://readwise.io/read">Readwise Reader</a>, which I love;
formerly <a href="https://freshrss.org/index.html">FreshRSS</a> and,
like everyone else, Google Reader before that), I almost never see
advertising on blogs, so it’s opaque to me.
</p>
<p>
It costs me about $50/month to host my blog on AWS; I’ve got a
long-festering to-do list item to optimize and lower this, but it has
yet to rise to the top of the list.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>

A special unit of the Israeli Defense Force, specializing in

center of the border town of Rafah, in southern Gaza on Sunday.  It was
1:49 a.m. Israel time, when this secret counter-terrorism unit

The Signal editorial board again moved to support one district attorney

warhead to shoot them down, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The intelligence came to light on Wednesday after Representative Mike
Turner, Republican chair of the U.S. House of Representatives
intelligence committee, issued an unusual statement warning of a
“serious national security threat.”</p>
<p>A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that Washington had new
intelligence related to Russian nuclear capabilities and attempts to
develop a space-based weapon, but added that the new Russian
capabilities did not pose an urgent threat to the United States. U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed this view on Thursday, saying
“this is not an active capability.”</p>
<p>Analysts tracking Russia’s space programs say the space threat is
probably not a nuclear warhead but rather a high-powered device
requiring nuclear energy to carry out an array of attacks against
satellites.</p>
<p>These might include signal-jammers, weapons that can blind image
sensors, or – a more dire possibility – electromagnetic pulses (EMPs)
that could fry all satellites’ electronics within a certain orbital
region.</p>
<p>“That Russia is developing a system powered by a nuclear source …
that has electronic warfare capabilities once in orbit is more likely
than the theory that Russia is developing a weapon that carries a
nuclear explosive warhead,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director of
the Arms Control Association advocacy group.</p>
<p>A 2023 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report said Russia is
developing an array of weapons designed to target individual satellites
and may also be developing “higher-power systems that extend the threat
to the structures of all satellites.”</p>
<p>The Kremlin on Thursday dismissed a warning by the United States
about Moscow’s new nuclear capabilities in space, calling it a
“malicious fabrication.” </p>
<p>The nuclear threat</p>
<p>Non-nuclear anti-satellite weapons have existed for years.</p>
<p>Russia in 2021 followed the United States, China and India by testing
a destructive anti-satellite missile on one of its old satellites,
blasting it to thousands of pieces that remain in Earth’s orbit.</p>
<p>Exploding a nuclear weapon in space would be another matter
entirely.</p>
<p>Brian Weeden, an analyst at the Secure World Foundation, said Russia
would undermine its credibility if it detonated a nuclear weapon in
space, a possibility with profound implications for both military and
commercial satellites.</p>
<p>“The Russians have spent 40 years in the U.N. bashing America about
wanting to weaponize space, and place weapons in space and pledging that
they would never do it,” Weeden said.</p>
<p>“If they do [detonate a nuclear device in space], they’d lose
everything. All the countries that are supporting them on Ukraine and
getting around sanctions, boom,” he added.</p>
<p>James Acton, a nuclear expert at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace think tank, said for Russia to put a nuclear weapon
in orbit would be a “blatant violation of the Outer Space Treaty.”</p>
<p>The 1967 treaty, to which the United States and Russia are parties,
bars signatories from placing “in orbit around the earth any objects
carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass
destruction.”</p>
<p>Violating the treaty, Acton said, would further undercut efforts to
revive U.S.-Russian arms control after Russia’s 2023 decision to suspend
participation in the New START treaty, which caps the number of
strategic nuclear warheads each can deploy.</p>
<p>Analysts said anti-satellite weapons could cripple military and
commercial communications, undermining the armed forces’ ability to
operate as well as global positioning systems (GPS) that everyone from
Uber drivers to food delivery services use.</p>
<p>“The Russians think we’re blind if we don’t have access to our
satellites and it’s probably true,” said a former U.S. intelligence
official. “Our ability to rely on satellites is a major advantage in a
potential confrontation but also a major vulnerability.”</p>

Sees No ‘Imminent’ War by North Korea Despite Dangerous Activities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The State Department  — The United States does not see signs of an
“imminent” war by North Korea despite “incredibly dangerous” activities
in recent months and its refusal to engage in diplomatic talks with the
U.S., a top U.S. official told reporters Thursday.</p>
<p>Jung Pak, the State Department’s senior official in charge of North
Korea affairs, said U.S. officials “are always watchful for any kind of
activity” by Pyongyang and will continue to work with Japan and South
Korea to bolster extended deterrence, aiming to shape North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un’s “calculus” regarding the initiation of direct
military action.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally, I don’t think Kim’s posture has changed. We don’t see
any signals of any direct action, military action,” Pak said.</p>
<p>“I don’t see an imminent or direct attack at this point,” she
said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, North Korea carried out its fifth cruise missile
launch of the year, which came just days ahead of a joint U.S.-Japan
missile defense training exercise scheduled for next week.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, a Japanese official issued a cautionary statement regarding
North Korea’s escalating capabilities.</p>
<p>“By launching missiles from various platforms such as submarines and
vehicle-mounted launch pads, we believe North Korea is making it
difficult to identify and detect signs [of its activities] to strengthen
its surprise attack capabilities,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa
Hayashi told a Thursday press conference.</p>
<p>Last month, Pyongyang said it test-fired a solid-fuel
intermediate-range missile, equipped with a hypersonic warhead, into
waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.</p>
<p>State Department official Pak said the U.S. estimated there were 69
ballistic missile tests by North Korea in 2022, and 30 ballistic missile
tests last year.</p>

I mean, its ideas about “Circles” are pretty similar to what I’m

Confirms Russia Pursuing ‘Space-Based’ Anti-Satellite System</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The new national security threat that sent some in
Washington into a tizzy and sparked calls urging Americans not to panic,
is a new Russian anti-satellite capability, the White House confirmed
Thursday, again emphasizing there is no immediate threat to life or
limb.</p>
<p>White House National Security spokesperson John Kirby declined to go
into details about the emerging Russian capability but said that U.S.
intelligence agencies have been tracking Russia’s pursuit of such
systems for a while, and that Washington has been reaching out to allies
on next steps.</p>
<p>“This is not an active capability that’s been deployed,” Kirby told
reporters. “And though Russia’s pursuit of this particular capability is
troubling, there is no immediate threat to anyone’s safety.”</p>
<p>“We are not talking about a weapon that can be used to attack human
beings or cause physical destruction here on Earth,” he added.</p>
<p>The explanation, and the effort to reassure the public, came just
more than 24 hours after a leading U.S. lawmaker took to social media,
demanding U.S. President Joe Biden declassify intelligence so the
American public and U.S. allies could formulate a response.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Mike Turner, chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, issued a statement Wednesday warning of “a
serious national security threat.”</p>
<p>“I am requesting that President Biden declassify all information
relating to this threat so that Congress, the Administration, and our
allies can openly discuss the actions necessary to respond,” Turner
added.</p>
<p>But both the White House and Pentagon on Thursday downplayed the need
for that type of urgency, while conceding the Russian advancement is
cause for concern.</p>
<p>“We’re taking this potential threat very, very seriously,” Kirby
said, adding that U.S. intelligence agencies have been aware of Moscow’s
pursuit of what he described as a “space-based” anti-satellite
capability for “many, many months, if not a few years.”</p>
<p>“But only in recent weeks now has the intelligence community been
able to assess with a higher sense of confidence exactly how Russia
continues to pursue it,” he said.</p>
<p>U.S. defense officials, likewise, emphasized the emerging Russian
capability does not come as a surprise.</p>
<p>“We are tracking what this is,” said Pentagon press secretary Major
General Pat Ryder.</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin “is part of the national security
team that’s been briefing the president,” Ryder told reporters, adding
that there is still a gap between Russia’s ambitions in space and what
it is currently capable of doing.</p>
<p>“It’s not an immediate threat. It’s not an active capability. It has
not been deployed,” he said.</p>
<p>For its part, Russia on Thursday dismissed the U.S. allegations about
an anti-satellite capability as a “malicious fabrication.”</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov accused Washington of engaging in
a ruse to get U.S. lawmakers to spend more funds.</p>
<p>“It is obvious that the White House is trying, by hook or by crook,
to encourage Congress to vote on a bill to allocate money, this is
obvious,” Peskov told reporters in Moscow.</p>
<p>Despite some consternation among some White House officials and
members of Congress about the way the public was alerted to the threat,
there is general agreement in the U.S. that the danger is real.</p>
<p>The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative
Jim Himes, said Wednesday the threat is “a significant one.” And the
leading Democrat and top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee
noted they have been tracking developments “rigorously,” describing the
matter as serious.</p>
<p>Some arms control experts warn that the ramifications of a new
Russian anti-satellite capability could be far-reaching.</p>
<p>“This would affect the global economy, the society writ large,” said
Daryl Kimball, director of the Arms Control Association.</p>
<p>“China would be deeply concerned. India would be extremely concerned
— countries that Russia has better relationships with than they do with
us,” Kimball told VOA. “So, I think there would be stinging rebuke. That
might be enough to encourage Russia to back down.”</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies have been warning for years that Russia
and China have been pursuing “a full range of anti-satellite weapons,”
noting that the development and use of such systems “could degrade U.S.
intelligence gathering abilities.”</p>
<p>One of the most recent declassified U.S. intelligence assessments
warned that Moscow continues to “field new anti-satellite weapons to
disrupt and degrade U.S. and allied space capabilities.”</p>
<p>Russia “is developing, testing, and fielding an array of
nondestructive and destructive counterspace weapons — including jamming
and cyberspace capabilities, directed energy weapons, on-orbit
capabilities, and ground-based ASAT [anti-satellite] capabilities,” the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence wrote in its 2023
Worldwide Threat Assessment report.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials appear to acknowledge that the new Russian
capability takes those ambitions a step further.</p>
<p>The NSC’s Kirby, while briefing reporters at the White House, said
the capability the Kremlin is pursuing “would be a violation of the
Outer Space Treaty to which more than 130 countries have signed up,
including Russia.”</p>
<p>That treaty, which entered into force in 1967, prohibits nations from
placing into space “any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other
kinds of weapons of mass destruction,” and further bans the installation
of such weapons on celestial bodies.</p>
<p>For now, Kirby says the White House intends to keep most of the
information classified, while working with allies on how to respond.</p>
<p>He said the U.S. has also reached out to Moscow, though there have
yet to be any real conversations on Russia’s attempts to achieve the new
space-based anti-satellite capability.</p>
<p>As for the U.S. lawmaker who ignited the initial clamor, he said
after being briefed by top White House, Pentagon and intelligence
officials late Thursday that he is satisfied, for now, with the U.S.
approach.</p>
<p>“We all came away with a very strong impression that the
administration is taking this very seriously and that the administration
has a plan in place,” Turner said. “We look forward to supporting them
as they go to implement it.”</p>
<p>Still, top U.S. officials warned of a possible fallout from Turner’s
decision to take his concerns public, saying that intelligence agency
sources and methods may have been compromised.</p>
<p>“We’re asking ourselves that very question right now,” said Kirby.
“We’re working our way through that analysis right now with the
intelligence community.”</p>
<p>Some information in the report came from Reuters.</p>

White House Asia Aide Moves to State Department as US-China Challenges
Heat Up</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Biden administration is now focusing on implementing
its goals for the Indo-Pacific, said analysts, as a White House
strategist who initiated policies for the region moves to the State
Department.</p>
<p>Kurt Campbell, who served as Indo-Pacific coordinator for the White
House National Security Council, initiated strategies that moved allies
and partners to cooperate on challenges across the region, from
counterbalancing China’s rise to offsetting North Korea’s threats. He is
going to a new position at the State Department.</p>
<p>He takes on the role of the deputy secretary of state, a position
vacant since July when Wendy Sherman retired. The Senate confirmed
Campbell on February 6  after President Joe Biden nominated him for the
position in November.</p>
<p>Campbell’s position as the Indo-Pacific coordinator will be left
unfilled, the Financial Times reported on February 6. Experts said that
if the Biden administration did not fill the Indo-Pacific position, it
would be a signal that Washington was now focusing on implementing the
strategies Campbell set in place.</p>
<p>“Important initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific strategy and the Camp
David summit are among the results of the decision by the incoming Biden
administration to create a brand-new position of Indo-Pacific
coordinator,” said Daniel Russel, who served as the assistant secretary
of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs during the Obama
administration.</p>
<p>“Now that those and other initiatives have been launched and that
interagency coordination on Indo-Pacific policy has matured, the
administration’s challenge is in implementation and the need for a
‘coordinator’ in the White House has diminished,” Russel said Tuesday
via email. He is the vice president for International Security and
Diplomacy at the Asia Society Policy Institute.</p>
<p>Biden appointed Campbell as the White House Indo-Pacific coordinator
in January 2021. Creation of the position came amid China’s increasing
assertiveness in the region.</p>
<p>Campbell was instrumental in bringing together South Korea and Japan
for a summit with the U.S. at Camp David in August. The two moved beyond
their historical animosity and agreed to work together against China’s
regional aggression and North Korea’s missile launches.</p>
<p>Campbell led the inaugural meeting of the Nuclear Consultative Group
held in July in Seoul to strengthen the bilateral alliance and reassure
South Korea of U.S. nuclear deterrence in the region.</p>
<p>He also revamped the informal transregional agreement known as the
QUAD among Australia, India, Japan and the U.S. in March 2021 and played
a key role in creating a trilateral security partnership among
Australia, the U.K. and the U.S., or AUKUS, in September 2021. China
views both as security ties threatening its rise to dominance in the
region.</p>
<p>Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson
Institute, said via email on Tuesday that Campbell’s “central role over
the past three years in defining strategies to compete [with], cooperate
[with], and confront China marks a clear path for engaging allies and
partners, dealing with China, and helping the U.S. negotiate from
strength.”</p>
<p>Cronin continued, “His absence as Indo-Pacific coordinator will be
significantly mitigated by his presence at the State [Department] and
the outstanding team he has left at the White House to help carry out a
vision he helped to mold.”</p>
<p>But concerns remain about the unfilled position for a region fraught
with rising threats from North Korea and coercive moves by China,
according to some analysts.</p>
<p>Dennis Wilder, senior director for East Asia at the White House’s
National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, said
via email, “The Biden administration should reconsider its decision not
to keep the position at a time when there is so much uncertainty about
North Korea and China’s intentions.”</p>
<p>North Korea’s state media KCNA said on Thursday that the country
tested new surface-to-sea missiles under the supervision of leader Kim
Jong Un the day before. It was the regime’s fifth cruise missile test
this year as Pyongyang threatens to take more aggressive moves against
South Korea.</p>
<p>China continues to antagonize its neighbors in South China Sea with
maritime maneuvers to assert its claim of sovereignty over disputed
territories.</p>
<p>Aside from security issues, Wilder, currently a senior fellow for the
Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown
University, said, “A major priority left undone in the Biden
Indo-Pacific strategy is trade policy.”</p>
<p>Wilder said via email on Wednesday, “The IPEF [Indo-Pacific
Framework] attempt to deal with this issue is stalled by congressional
resistance because of concerns over the labor, human rights and climate
change policies of partner nations. The administration must find a way
to balance the robust security alliances and partnerships with an
equally effective set of regional economic policies.”</p>
<p>The IPEF includes four pillars: trade; supply chains; clean energy,
decarbonization and infrastructure; and tax and anti-corruption. Biden
launched the IPEF in Tokyo in May 2022 to set up sustainable common
standards among countries in the region. The IPEF partners including
South Korea and Japan account for 40% of the global economy.</p>
<p>China, not an IPEF member, perceives it as an ineffective effort to
reduce its economic influence. He Weiwen, a senior fellow at the Center
for China and Globalization, told the official Global Times in 2023,
“The IPEF is neither a trade agreement nor an economic community. It’s
just a framework, meaning that it will have no real efficacy.”</p>
