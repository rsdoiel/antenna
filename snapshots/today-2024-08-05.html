drops 1,000 points; Japanese stocks plunge as markets quake
worldwide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A scary Monday that started with a plunge abroad
reminiscent of 1987 ’s crash swept around the world and pummeled Wall
Street with more steep losses, as fears worsened about a slowing U.S.
economy.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 dropped 3% for its worst day in nearly two years. The
Dow Jones Industrial Average reeled by 1,033 points, or 2.6%, while the
Nasdaq composite slid 3.4% as Apple, Nvidia and other Big Tech companies
that used to be the stars of the stock market continued to wilt.</p>
<p>The drops were the latest in a global sell-off that began last week.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 helped begin Monday by plunging 12.4% for its worst
day since the Black Monday crash of 1987.</p>
<p>It was the first chance for traders in Tokyo to react to Friday’s
report showing U.S. employers slowed their hiring last month by much
more than economists expected. That was the latest piece of data on the
U.S. economy to come in weaker than expected, and it’s all raised fear
the Federal Reserve has pressed the brakes on the U.S. economy by too
much for too long through high interest rates in hopes of stifling
inflation.</p>
<p>Professional investors cautioned that some technical factors could be
amplifying the action in markets, and that the drops may be overdone,
but the losses were still neck-snapping. South Korea’s Kospi index
careened 8.8% lower, and bitcoin dropped below $54,000 from more than
$61,000 on Friday.</p>
<p>Even gold, which has a reputation for offering safety during
tumultuous times, slipped about 1%.</p>
<p>That’s in part because traders began wondering if the damage has been
so severe that the Federal Reserve will have to cut interest rates in an
emergency meeting, before its next scheduled decision on Sept. 18. The
yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for
the Fed, briefly sank below 3.70% during the morning from 3.88% late
Friday and from 5% in April. It later recovered and pulled back to
3.89%.</p>
<p>“The Fed could ride in on a white horse to save the day with a big
rate cut, but the case for an inter-meeting cut seems flimsy,” said
Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. “Those are
usually reserved for emergencies, like COVID, and an unemployment rate
of 4.3% doesn’t really seem like an emergency.”</p>
<p>Of course, the U.S. economy is still growing, the U.S. stock market
is still up a healthy amount for the year and a recession is far from a
certainty. The Fed has been clear about the tightrope it began walking
when it started hiking rates sharply in March 2022: Being too aggressive
would choke the economy, but going too soft would give inflation more
oxygen and hurt everyone.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle sees a higher chance of a
recession within the next 12 months following Friday’s jobs report. But
he still sees only a 25% probability of that, up from 15%, in part
“because the data look fine overall” and he does not “see major
financial imbalances.”</p>
<p>Some of Wall Street’s recent declines may simply be air coming out of
a stock market that romped to dozens of all-time highs this year, in
part on a frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.</p>
<p>“Markets tend to move higher like they’re climbing stairs, and they
go down like they’re falling out a window,” according to JJ Kinahan, CEO
of IG North America. He chalks much of the recent worries to euphoria
around AI subsiding, with pressure rising on companies to show how AI is
turning into profits, and “a market that was ahead of itself.”</p>
<p>Treasury yields also pared their losses Monday after a report said
growth for U.S. services businesses was a touch stronger than expected.
Growth was led by arts, entertainment and recreation businesses, along
with accommodations and food services, according to the Institute for
Supply Management.</p>
<p>Still, stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the
economy’s strength took sharp losses on the fears about a slowdown. The
small companies in the Russell 2000 index dropped 3.3%, washing out what
had been a revival for it and other beaten-down areas of the market.</p>
<p>Making things worse for Wall Street, Big Tech stocks tumbled as the
market’s most popular trade for much of this year continued to unravel.
Apple, Nvidia and a handful of other Big Tech stocks known as the
“Magnificent Seven” had propelled the S&amp;P 500 to record after record
this year, even as high interest rates weighed down much of the rest of
the stock market.</p>
<p>But Big Tech’s momentum turned last month on worries investors had
taken their prices too high and expectations for future growth are
becoming too difficult to meet. A set of underwhelming profit reports
that began with updates from Tesla and Alphabet added to the pessimism
and accelerated the declines.</p>
<p>All told, the S&amp;P 500 fell 160.23 points to 5,186.33. The Dow
sank 1,033.99 to 38,703.27, and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 576.08 to
16,200.08.</p>

personnel wounded in attack against base in Iraq, officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — At least five U.S. personnel were injured in an attack
against a military base in Iraq on Monday, U.S. officials told Reuters,
as the Middle East braced for a possible new wave of attacks by Iran and
its allies following last week’s killing of senior members of militant
groups Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Two Katyusha rockets were fired at al Asad airbase in western Iraq,
two Iraqi security sources said. One Iraqi security source said the
rockets fell inside the base. It was unclear whether the attack was
linked to threats by Iran to retaliate over the killings.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Iran said the U.S. bears responsibility in the
assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran because of its
support for Israel.</p>
<p>The U.S. officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity,
said one of the wounded Americans was seriously injured. The casualty
count was based on initial reports which could still change, they
said. </p>
<p>“Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment,” one
of the officials added.</p>
<p>Last week the U.S. carried out a strike in Iraq against individuals
U.S. officials said were militants getting ready to launch drones and
posed a threat to U.S. and coalition forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. has been watching to see if Iran would make good on its vow
to respond to the killing of Haniyeh two days ago in Tehran, one in a
series of killings of senior figures in the Palestinian militant group
as the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza rages.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has said it will deploy additional fighter jets and Navy
warships to the Middle East, as Washington seeks to bolster defenses
following threats from Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>A rare ally of both the U.S. and Iran, Iraq hosts 2,500 U.S. troops
and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces. It has
witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war
erupted in October.</p>
<p>Iraq wants troops from the U.S.-led military coalition to begin
withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition’s work by
September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some U.S. forces likely to
remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.</p>
<p>Baghdad has struggled to reign in Iran-backed armed groups that have
attacked U.S. forces there and in neighboring Syria dozens of times
since Oct. 7.</p>
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani spoke with U.S.
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Sunday.</p>
<p>An Iraqi official said Blinken asked Sudani to help decrease regional
tensions by helping to convince Iran to temper its response to an
Israeli strike in Tehran that killed the leader of Hamas last week. </p>
<p>U.S. Army General Michael “Erik” Kurilla, head of U.S. Central
Command, is currently in the Middle East. One of the U.S. officials said
Kurilla was speaking with allies to ensure there was coordination in
case of an Iranian attack against Israel.</p>

id="us-judge-rules-google-is-a-monopoly-search-deals-with-apple-and-mozilla-in-peril">US
judge rules Google is a monopoly, search deals with Apple and Mozilla in
peril</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>That sure is a big news drop for a random Tuesday. A federal judge
ruled that Google violated US antitrust law by maintaining a monopoly in
the search and advertising markets. “After having carefully considered
and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the
following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to
maintain its monopoly,” according to the court’s ruling, which you can
read in full at the bottom of this story. “It has violated Section 2 of
the Sherman Act.” ↫ Lauren Feiner at The Verge Among many other things,
the judge mentions Google’s own admissions that the company can do
pretty much whatever it wants with Google Search and its advertisement
business, without having to worry about users opting to go elsewhere or
ad buyers leaving the Google platform. Studies from inside Google itself
made it very clear that Google could systematically make Search worse
without it affecting user and/or usage numbers in any way, shape, or
form – because users have nowhere else to realistically go. While the
ability to raise prices at will without fear of losing customers is a
sure sign of being a monopoly, so is being able to make a product worse
without fear of losing customers, the judge argues. Google plans to
appeal, obviously, and this ruling has nothing yet to say about
potential remedies, so what, exactly, is going to change is as of yet
unknown. Potential remedies will be handled during the next phase of the
proceedings, with the wildest and most aggressive remedy being a
potential break-up of Google, Alphabet, or whatever it’s called today.
My sights are definitely set on a break-up – hopefully followed by
Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft – to create some much-needed
breathing room into the technology market, and pave the way for a
massive number of newcomers to compete on much fairer terms. Of note is
that the judge also put yet another nail in the coffin of Google’s
various exclusivity deals, most notable with Apple and, for our
interests, with Mozilla. Google pays Apple well over 20 billion dollars
a year to be the default search engine on iOS, and it pays about 80% of
Mozilla’s revenue to be the default search engine in Firefox. According
to the judge, such deals are anticompetitive. Mehta rejected Google’s
arguments that its contracts with phone and browser makers like Apple
were not exclusionary and therefore shouldn’t qualify it for liability
under the Sherman Act. “The prospect of losing tens of billions in
guaranteed revenue from Google — which presently come at little to no
cost to Apple — disincentivizes Apple from launching its own search
engine when it otherwise has built the capacity to do so,” he wrote. ↫
Lauren Feiner at The Verge If the end of these deals become part of the
package of remedies, it will be a massive financial blow to Apple – 20
billion dollars a year is about 15% of Apple’s total annual operating
profits, and I’m also pretty sure those Google billions are counted as
part of Tim Cook’s much-vaunted services revenue, so losing it would
definitely impact Apple directly where it hurts. Sure, it’s not like
it’ll make Apple any less of a dangerous behemoth, but it will
definitely have some explaining to do to investors. Much more worrisome,
however, is the similar deal Google has with Mozilla. About 80% of
Mozilla’s total revenue comes from a search deal with Google, and if
that deal were to be dissolved, the consequences for Mozilla, and thus
for Firefox, would be absolutely immense. This is something I’ve been
warning about for years now, and the end of this deal would be yet
another worry that I’ve voiced repeatedly becoming reality, right after
Mozilla becoming an advertising company and making Firefox worse in the
name of quick profits. One by one, every single concern I’ve voiced
about the future of Firefox is becoming reality. Canonical, Fedora, KDE,
GNOME, and many other stakeholders – ignore these developments at your
own peril.</p>

Supreme Court declines to halt Trump’s sentencing in hush money
case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid by the
state of Missouri to halt Donald Trump’s upcoming sentencing for his
conviction in New York on felony charges involving hush money paid to an
adult film star and left a related gag order until after the November 5
presidential election.</p>
<p>The decision by the justices came in response to Missouri’s lawsuit
claiming that the case against Trump infringed on the right of voters
under the U.S. Constitution to hear from the Republican presidential
nominee as he seeks to regain the White House.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s order was unsigned. Conservative Justices
Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito indicated they would have taken up
Missouri’s case but added that they “would not grant other relief.”</p>
<p>Trump was found guilty in May of falsifying business records to cover
up a $130,000 payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in exchange for
her silence before the 2016 U.S. election about a sexual encounter she
has said she had with Trump years earlier. Prosecutors have said the
payment was designed help Trump’s chances in the 2016 election, when he
defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Trump, the Republican candidate in this year’s election, denies
having had sex with Daniels and has vowed to appeal his conviction after
his sentencing, scheduled for September.</p>
<p>Missouri’s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey filed a July 3
lawsuit against New York state asking the Supreme Court to pause Trump’s
impending sentencing and the gag order placed on him by New York state
judge Juan Merchan.</p>
<p>Legal disputes between states are filed directly to the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>Bailey argued that the criminal case against Trump violated the right
of Missouri residents under the Constitution’s First Amendment to “hear
from and vote for their preferred presidential candidate.”</p>
<p>“Instead of letting presidential candidates campaign on their own
merits, radical progressives in New York are trying to rig the 2024
election by waging a direct attack on our democratic process,” Bailey
said in bringing the case.</p>
<p>Republican attorneys general from Florida, Iowa, Montana and Alaska
filed a Supreme Court brief in support of Missouri’s lawsuit.</p>
<p>Trump also faces federal and state criminal charges involving his
efforts to undo his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court in a July 1 ruling powered by its 6-3 conservative
majority granted Trump substantial criminal immunity for actions taken
in office. It all but ensured Trump would not face trial in the federal
election subversion case before the election.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers promptly invoked the immunity ruling in a bid to toss
the hush money verdict. They said prosecutors improperly relied on
social media posts made in 2018 by Trump when he was serving as
president that qualified as official communications.</p>
<p>The judge in the case said he would rule on Trump’s arguments by
September 6. Merchan said that if he upholds the conviction, he would
sentence Trump on September 18.</p>
<p>A New York state appeals court last week rejected Trump’s challenge
to his gag order. The decision by the Appellate Division in Manhattan
means Trump, who has called all the criminal cases against him
politically motivated, cannot comment publicly about individual
prosecutors and others in the case until his sentencing.</p>

id="secretaries-of-state-urge-elon-musk-to-fix-ai-chatbot-spreading-election-misinformation-on-x">Secretaries
of state urge Elon Musk to fix AI chatbot spreading election
misinformation on X</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chicago — Five secretaries of state are urging Elon Musk to fix an AI
chatbot on the social media platform X, saying in a letter sent Monday
that it has spread election misinformation.</p>
<p>The top election officials from Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania and Washington told Musk that X’s AI chatbot, Grok,
produced false information about state ballot deadlines shortly after
President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>While Grok is available only to subscribers to the premium versions
of X, the misinformation was shared across multiple social media
platforms and reached millions of people, according to the letter. The
bogus ballot deadline information from the chatbot also referenced
Alabama, Indiana, Ohio and Texas, although their secretaries of state
did not sign the letter. Grok continued to repeat the false information
for 10 days before it was corrected, the secretaries said.</p>
<p>The letter urged X to immediately fix the chatbot “to ensure voters
have accurate information in this critical election year.” That would
include directing Grok to send users to CanIVote.org, a voting
information website run by the National Association of Secretaries of
State, when asked about U.S. elections.</p>
<p>“In this presidential election year, it is critically important that
voters get accurate information on how to exercise their right to vote,”
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said in a statement. “Voters
should reach out to their state or local election officials to find out
how, when, and where they can vote.”</p>
<p>X did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Grok debuted last year for X premium and premium plus subscribers and
was touted by Musk as a “rebellious” AI chatbot that will answer “spicy
questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.”</p>
<p>Social media platforms have faced mounting scrutiny for their role in
spreading misinformation, including about elections. The letter also
warned that inaccuracies are to be expected for AI products, especially
chatbots such as Grok that are based on large language models.</p>
<p>“As tens of millions of voters in the U.S. seek basic information
about voting in this major election year, X has the responsibility to
ensure all voters using your platform have access to guidance that
reflects true and accurate information about their constitutional right
to vote,” the secretaries wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>Since Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it to X, watchdog
groups have raised concerns over a surge in hate speech and
misinformation being amplified on the platform, as well as the reduction
of content moderation teams, elimination of misinformation features and
censoring of journalists critical of Musk.</p>
<p>Experts say the moves represent a regression from progress made by
social media platforms attempting to better combat political
disinformation after the 2016 U.S. presidential contest and could
precipitate a worsening misinformation landscape ahead of this year’s
November elections.</p>

urged countries to ‘pass messages’ to Iran against escalation, State
Department says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States has been urging countries through its
diplomatic engagements to tell Iran that escalation in the Middle East
is not in their interest, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller
said Monday. </p>
<p>Speaking at a daily briefing, Miller said this was a “critical
moment” for the region and that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
was working the phones to help calm the tensions, but also said
Washington was preparing for all possibilities. </p>
<p>Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated in the Iranian capital
Tehran last week, an attack that drew threats of revenge on Israel and
fueled further concern that the conflict in Gaza was turning into a
wider Middle East war. </p>
<p>Iran has blamed Israel and has said it will “punish” it; Israeli
officials have not claimed responsibility for the killing. Iran backs
Hamas, which is at war with Israel in Gaza, and also supports the
Lebanese group Hezbollah, whose senior military commander Fuad Shukr was
killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut last week. </p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat spoke Monday with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh
Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr
Abdelatty on the tensions in the Middle East. </p>
<p>“One of the points of the engagements that we have had is to urge
countries to pass messages to Iran and urge countries to make clear to
Iran that it is very much not in their interests to escalate this
conflict, that it is very much not in their interest to launch another
attack on Israel,” he said. </p>
<p>Miller did not say definitively whether Washington’s messages have
been disseminated to Iran or through which channel. </p>
<p>“I would expect that some of them would pass that message along and
impress that point upon the government of Iran,” he added.</p>

id="google-loses-massive-antitrust-case-over-its-search-dominance">Google
loses massive antitrust case over its search dominance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A judge on Monday ruled that Google’s ubiquitous search
engine has been illegally exploiting its dominance to squash competition
and stifle innovation in a seismic decision that could shake up the
internet and hobble one of the world’s best-known companies.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated decision issued by U.S. District Judge Amit
Mehta comes nearly a year after the start of a trial pitting the U.S.
Justice Department against Google in the country’s biggest antitrust
showdown in a quarter century.</p>
<p>After reviewing reams of evidence that included testimony from top
executives at Google, Microsoft and Apple during last year’s 10-week
trial, Mehta issued his potentially market-shifting decision three
months after the two sides presented their closing arguments in early
May.</p>
<p>“After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony
and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a
monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” Mehta
wrote in his 277-page ruling.</p>
<p>It represents a major setback for Google and its parent, Alphabet
Inc., which had steadfastly argued that its popularity stemmed from
consumers’ overwhelming desire to use a search engine so good at what it
does that it has become synonymous with looking things up online.</p>
<p>Google’s search engine currently processes an estimated 8.5 billion
queries per day worldwide, nearly doubling its daily volume from 12
years ago, according to a recent study released by the investment firm
BOND.</p>
<p>Google almost certainly will appeal the decision in a process that
ultimately may land in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>For now, the decision vindicates antitrust regulators at the Justice
Department, which filed its lawsuit nearly four years ago while Donald
Trump was still president and has been escalating it efforts to rein in
Big Tech’s power during President Joe Biden’s administration.</p>
<p>The case depicted Google as a technological bully that methodically
has thwarted competition to protect a search engine that has become the
centerpiece of a digital advertising machine that generated nearly $240
billion in revenue last year. Justice Department lawyers argued that
Google’s monopoly enabled it to charge advertisers artificially high
prices while also enjoying the luxury of having to invest more time and
money into improving the quality of its search engine — a lax approach
that hurt consumers.</p>
<p>As expected, Mehta’s ruling focused on the billions of dollars Google
spends every year to install its search engine as the default option on
new cellphones and tech gadgets. In 2021 alone, Google spent more than
$26 billion to lock in those default agreements, Mehta said in his
ruling.</p>
<p>Google ridiculed those allegations, noting that consumers have
historically changed search engines when they become disillusioned with
the results they were getting. For instance, Yahoo — now a minor player
on the internet — was the most popular search engine during the 1990s
before Google came along.</p>
<p>Mehta said the evidence at trial showed the importance of the default
settings. He noted that Microsoft’s Bing search engine has 80% share of
the search market on the Microsoft Edge browser. The judge said that
shows other search engines can be successful if Google is not locked in
as the predetermined default option.</p>
<p>Still, Mehta credited the quality of Google’s product as an important
part of its dominance, as well, saying flatly that “Google is widely
recognized as the best [general search engine] available in the United
States.”</p>
<p>Mehta’s conclusion that Google has been running an illegal monopoly
sets up another legal phase to determine what sorts of changes or
penalties should be imposed to reverse the damage done and restore a
more competitive landscape.</p>
<p>Besides boosting Microsoft’s Bing search engine, the outcome could
hurt Google at a critical pivot point that is tilting technology in the
age of artificial intelligence. Both Microsoft and Google are among the
early leaders in AI in a battle that now could be affected by Mehta’s
market-rattling decision.</p>
<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was one of the Justice Department’s star
witnesses during the testimony that covered his frustration with Google
deals with the likes of Apple that made it nearly impossible for the
Bing search engine to make any headway, even as Microsoft poured more
than $100 billion in improvements since 2009.</p>
<p>“You get up in the morning, you brush your teeth, and you search on
Google,” Nadella said at one point in his testimony. “Everybody talks
about the open web, but there is really the Google web.”</p>
<p>Nadella also expressed fear that it might take an antitrust crackdown
to ensure the situation didn’t get worse as AI becomes a bigger force in
search.</p>
<p>Google still faces other legal threats besides this one, both in the
U.S. and abroad. any antitrust lawsuits brought against Google
domestically and abroad. In September, a federal trial is scheduled to
begin in Virginia over the Justice Department’s allegations that
Google’s advertising technology constitutes an illegal monopoly.</p>

id="every-microsoft-employee-is-now-being-judged-on-their-security-work">Every Microsoft employee
is now being judged on their security work</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>After a number of very bug security incidents involving Microsoft’s
software, the company promised it would take steps to put security at
the top of its list of priorities. Today we got another glimpse of the
step it’s taking, since the company is going to take security into
account during performance reviews. Kathleen Hogan, Microsoft’s chief
people officer, has outlined what the company expects of employees in an
internal memo obtained by The Verge. “Everyone at Microsoft will have
security as a Core Priority,” says Hogan. “When faced with a tradeoff,
the answer is clear and simple: security above all else.” A lack of
security focus for Microsoft employees could impact promotions,
merit-based salary increases, and bonuses. “Delivering impact for the
Security Core Priority will be a key input for managers in determining
impact and recommending rewards,” Microsoft is telling employees in an
internal Microsoft FAQ on its new policy. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge Now,
I’ve never worked in a corporate environment or something even remotely
close to it, but something about this feels off to me. Often, it seems
that individual, lower-level employees know all too well they’re cutting
corners, but they’re effectively forced to because management expects
almost inhuman results from its workers. So, in the case of a technology
company like Microsoft, this means workers are pushed to write as much
code as possible, or to implement as many features as possible, and the
only way to achieve the goals set by management is to take shortcuts –
like not caring as much about code quality or security. In other words,
I don’t see how Microsoft employees are supposed to make security their
top priority, while also still having to achieve any unrealistic goals
set by management and other higher-ups. What I’m missing from this memo
and associated reporting is Microsoft telling its employees that if
unrealistic targets, crunch, low pay, and other factors that contribute
to cutting corners get in the way of putting security first, they have
the freedom to choose security. If employees are not given such freedom,
demanding even more from them without anything in return seems like a
recipe for disaster to me, making this whole memo quite moot. We’ll have
to see what this will amount to in practice, but with how horrible
employees are treated in most industries these days, especially in
countries with terrible union coverage and laughable labour protection
laws like the US, I don’t have high hopes for this.</p>

<h2 id="years-ago-cpm-started-the-microcomputer-revolution">50 years
ago, CP/M started the microcomputer revolution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>CP/M is turning 50 this year. The ancient Control Program for
Microcomputers, or CP/M for short, has been enjoying a modest
renaissance in recent years. By 21st century standards, it’s
unimaginably tiny and simple. The whole OS fits into under 200 kB, and
the resident bit of the kernel is only about 3 kB. Today, in the era of
end-user OSes in the tens-of-gigabytes size range, this exerts a
fascination to a certain kind of hobbyist. Back when it was new, though,
this wasn’t minimalist – it was all that early hardware could support. ↫
Liam Proven I’m a little too young to have experienced CP/M as anything
other than a retro platform – I’m from 1984, and we got our first
computer in 1990 or so – but its importance and influence cannot be
overstated. Many of the conventions set by CP/M made their way to the
various DOS variants, and in turn, we still see some of those
conventions in Windows today. Had Digital Research, the company CP/M
creator Gary Kildall set up to sell CP/M, accepted the deal with IBM to
make CP/M the default operating system for the then newly-created IBM
PC, we’d be living in a very different world today. Digital Research
would also create several other popular and/or influential software
products beyond CP/M, such as DR DOS and GEM, as well as various other
DOS variants and CP/M versions with DOS compatibility. It would
eventually be acquired by Novell, where it faded into obscurity.</p>

rules that Google ‘is a monopolist’ in US antitrust case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;

<p>
[<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24155520/judge-rules-on-us-doj-v-google-antitrust-search-suit">Lauren
Feiner at The Verge</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“A federal judge ruled that Google violated US antitrust law by
maintaining a monopoly in the search and advertising markets.
</p>
<p>
“After having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and
evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a
monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,” the
court’s ruling, which you can read in full at the bottom of this story,
reads. “It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.”“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is seismic, both for Google and for the web. As The Verge points
out, this is so far about liabilities, not about any prescriptive
remedy. But as one of the major factors in the decision was the payments
that Google makes to browser manufacturers, it seems likely that any
remedy will change how this works. In turn, the impact across tech could
be significant.
</p>
<p>
Apple received $20 billion from Google in 2022 to be the default search
engine (it shares 36% of ad revenue from Safari users with the company).
That’s a big number, but nothing compared to its $394bn in total
revenue. But for Mozilla, the impact might be more profound:
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-05/why-google-keeps-paying-mozilla-s-firefox-even-as-chrome-dominates">in
2021, these payments represented 83% of its revenue</a>. What happens to
it without this underwriting?
</p>
<p>
It’s too early to say exactly what will change, but this is also
potentially a gift for the new batch of AI startups that are trying to
seize search engine ground. The era of the internet flux that we’ve
found ourselves in - wherein everything is once again up for grabs and
seemingly-entrenched incumbents change dramatically at a moment’s notice
- shows no sign of slowing.

<h2 id="arpa-e-is-cleantechs-favorite-shadow-vc">ARPA-E Is Cleantech’s
Favorite Shadow VC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzAyMTcxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3ODcyNTU1Mn0.kgi6uOoyws_zwnAZI7-ma4Z0aDv6fgg3ZUbe5Lqusn4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
When the George W. Bush administration established the Advanced Research
Projects Agency - Energy, better known as ARPA-E, the number one
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/about/authorization" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>goal</u></a>
for the new agency sounded an ambitious and patriotic note: “To enhance
the economic and energy security of the United States through the
development of energy technologies.” And from that uncontroversial
foundation, a bipartisan bastion of cleantech innovation was born.
</p>
<p>
I knew I wanted to dig into the critical role that ARPA-E plays in the
climate tech funding landscape after Rajesh Swaminathan, a partner at
Khosla Ventures, told me that he views the agency as the “least talked
about VC in town.” So I reached out to ARPA-E’s director, Evelyn Wang,
to learn more.
</p>
<p>
Of course, ARPA-E isn’t actually a venture capital firm — it provides
no-strings-attached funding to promising energy projects rather than
aiming for a return on investment. “So a little bit different,” Wang
told me. “Our mission is very much focused on energy independence,
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and enhancing energy efficiency.”
</p>
<p>
The Bush administration established ARPA-E in 2007 with the passage of
the America COMPETES Act, which aimed to improve the technological
competitiveness of the United States via investments in research and
development. But the agency was funded for the first time in 2009, under
Obama, as a part of an $800 billion stimulus package in response to the
Great Recession. A substantial chunk of that funding — $90 billion — was
allocated for clean energy, which the
<a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/02/25/fact-sheet-recovery-act-made-largest-single-investment-clean-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>administration
would go on to boast</u></a> amounted to the “largest single investment
in clean energy in history.”
</p>
<p>
Yet whether it’s been Bush or Obama — or Trump or Biden — in the White
House, the messaging around ARPA-E has always trended less towards
renewables and climate mitigation and more towards energy security and
economic competitiveness. As the name suggests, ARPA-E is modeled after
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, which was
established in 1958 in response to the Soviet’s launch of the Sputnik
satellite. DARPA has since helped birth such little-known tech as the
entire internet, GPS, automated voice recognition, and self-driving
cars.
</p>
<p>
But while the de facto customer for DARPA-developed tech is always the
Department of Defense, the pathway to commercialization for ARPA-E
projects mainly relies on private sector interest. In that sense, the
goal of ARPA-E is neatly aligned with that of venture capitalists: Get
tech to market. Because while scientific learnings are all well and
good, Wang said that “ultimately, we need to see these technologies
commercialized — to actually <em><em>be out there </em></em>— to
actually affect the ecosystem and change the energy landscape.”
</p>
<p>
Since ARPA-E can eschew the profit motive, it’s able to fund high-risk,
high-reward projects at the earliest stages, when most investors would
be reluctant to take on that level of uncertainty. Yet the inherent risk
means the success rate for ARPA-E projects
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/about/our-impact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
measured by metrics</u></a> such as the number of companies it’s spawned
(157), exits via mergers, acquisitions or IPOs (30), and additional
partnerships with other government agencies (360), can seem low compared
to the 1,590 projects that the agency has funded over the past 15 years.
A climate tech investor I spoke with on background told me that while
they love ARPA-E and are glad it exists, they were expecting more
success stories by now.
</p>
<p>
That’s at least partially because even after a project is funded and
proof-of-concept has been demonstrated, there’s often still a ways to go
before investors are ready to jump in. “I think when we first stood up
ARPA-E, the idea was that at that point, it would be sufficiently
de-risked for the private sector to then pick it up and invest,” Wang
told me. But frequently, that hasn’t been the case. ARPA-E usually funds
projects for one to three years, but often climate tech innovation
relies on deeply complex and thus inherently slow advancements in
science and engineering — think fusion energy, novel battery
development, or direct air capture. Many venture funds have 10 year time
horizons, so if investors don’t see a payoff happening in that
timeframe, they’ll probably hold back.
</p>
<p>
The investor I spoke with on background told me that ARPA-E has become
more effective in partnership with the Office of Clean Energy
Demonstrations, established in 2021 under the Department of Energy,
which uses its $25 billion budget to create model buildouts of new
technology with private sector partners. Earlier this year, OCED
selected
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/blog-posts/six-arpa-e-awardees-among-teams-set-receive-775m-funding-part-historic" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>six
ARPA-E awardees</u></a> focused on industrial decarbonization to receive
a combined total of up to $775 million.
</p>
<p>
Even so, the investor told me, ARPA-E funding alone still might not be
enough to get companies to a place where OCED would be interested. To
help close that gap, ARPA-E started a program called SCALEUP, a mouthful
of an acronym for The Seeding Critical Advances for Leading Energy
(Technologies) with Untapped Potential, in 2019. It provides a small
number of ARPA-E projects with follow-on funding to further prove out
their concepts — provided they can identify at least one
commercialization partner such as a potential customer, end-user, or
supplier willing to take a stake in the development of the tech and help
it get to market.
</p>
<p>
So far, Wang says the program has yielded some successes. The list
includes LongPath Technologies, which monitors methane emissions and
leaks in the oil and gas industry and
<a href="https://www.longpathtech.com/news/longpath-technologies-secures-up-to-189m-conditional-loan-commitment-from-u-s-department-of-energy-for-usa-methane-emissions-monitoring-network" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>received
a conditional loan</u></a> last year from the DOE’s Loan Programs
Office; Natron Energy, which just opened the
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240428240613/en/Natron-Energy-Achieves-First-Ever-Commercial-Scale-Production-of-Sodium-Ion-Batteries-in-the-U.S." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>first
commercial-scale</u></a> sodium-ion battery production facility in the
U.S.; and
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/arpa-e-disruptors/sila-nanotechnologies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sila</u></a>,
a battery materials manufacturer that has raised over $1.3 billion in
total, and secured contracts with Mercedes-Benz and Panasonic.
</p>
<p>
When you look at ARPA-E’s success rate in terms of dollars in and
dollars out, though, it starts to look pretty darn efficacious as is.
Since 2009, ARPA-E has provided more than $3.8 billion for research and
development, leading to over $12.6 billion in private-sector follow-on
funding, while the 30 exits to date have yielded a combined market
valuation of $22.2 billion. And since it often takes climate tech
companies
<a href="https://www.ctvc.co/exits-analysis-clean-tech-climate-tech/#:~:text=The%20median%20time%20from%20founding,companies%20and%20private%20equity%20firms." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>around
a decade</u></a> to mature to the point where they’re ready for an exit
event, many of ARPA-E’s companies have yet to reach the acquisition or
IPO threshold.
</p>
<p>
These days, ARPA-E projects are facing a completely different funding
landscape than in the 2000s — one ripe with both excitement and cash as
well as increasing competition. So while Wang told me that the agency’s
goal is always to look for “technological whitespace” in the energy
landscape, “it’s getting more crowded,” she said. “And I think in that
context, we’ve strategically decided that we should also think about
broader vision type efforts.” To that end, ARPA-E has
<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/press-releases/arpa-e-announces-150-million-develop-systems-provide-abundant-primary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>identified
three comprehensive focus areas</u></a>: developing clean primary energy
sources such as geothermal, small modular nuclear reactors, fusion and
geologic hydrogen; power delivery for non-electrical sources, such as
energy transported via hydrogen or heat; and figuring out how to source
carbon sustainably, such as via engineered plants and algae.
</p>
<p>
Now that ARPA-E has been supporting projects for a decade and a half,
it’s getting more experimental when it comes to developing novel
testbeds for its tech. Exhibit A is the San Antonio International
Airport,
which<a href="https://arpa-e.energy.gov/news-and-media/press-releases/arpa-e-announces-innovation-agreement-outlining-vision-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>recently signed a memorandum of understanding</u></a> with the agency
to deploy a series of ARPA-E backed technologies.
</p>
<p>
Many major airports are actually higher tech than passengers may
realize, and given the mounting pressure on the aviation industry to
decarbonize, they’re also open to novel sustainability solutions. In San
Antonio, the airport is deploying EV chargers from Imagen Energy and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/sodium-batteries-china" target="_self"><u>sodium-ion
battery tech</u></a> from Natron Energy, both of which could help
electrify their ground vehicles, as well as a distributed energy
management system from Autogrid, which allows airports to control their
virtual power plants, microgrids, EV fleet, and demand response
measures. Other tech, such as hybrid-electric planes from Ampaire, could
be integrated into the airport in the future.
</p>
<p>
That’s a lot of technology development for not many headlines. And when
a company raises a major round or goes public, sometimes you have to dig
deep to discover their ARPA-E origins. Hence, the “least talked about VC
in town” comment. In some sense, Wang says, this is intentional.
</p>
<p>
“When we think about success, if our teams, our companies are
successful, and they shine, then we shine,” she told me, and maybe
that’s the way it should continue to be. Because while advertising
government investment in anything seen as “clean” or “green” can
immediately draw both partisan praise and ire, funding for ARPA-E has
been steadily creeping up nearly every year since 2015. And yes, that
includes the Trump era, even though the former president
<a href="https://time.com/4703638/donald-trump-budget-energy-arpa-epa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seemingly
wanted to axe the agency</u></a> altogether. Congress, it turned out,
was not on board with that plan.
</p>
<p>
“Our mission is about energy independence and bolstering our economy and
I think everyone agrees with this mission,” Wang told me. “Everyone,” of
course, will always be an overstatement. But perhaps Wang is right that
the agency does function better as a behind-the-scenes player. As she
put it, speaking of the companies the agency funds, “It’s more about
them, right? And how that affects the ecosystem, and helps our nation in
terms of what we need to do as a country, and how that sets an example
for the world.”

id="americans-have-more-depth-than-anyone-at-pool-but-gold-harder-to-come-by">Americans
have more depth than anyone at pool, but gold harder to come by</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NANTERRE, France — No one can match America’s depth at the
pool.  </p>
<p>That said, claiming the top step on the Olympic medal podium is no
longer a given for U.S. swimmers.  </p>
<p>Nine days of thrilling competition at La Defense Arena wrapped up
Sunday night with the Americans barely pulling out the lead in the gold
medal standings thanks to a victory in the last race.  </p>
<p>The U.S. finished with eight golds, its fewest since the 1988 Seoul
Games and one ahead of its biggest rival, Australia.  </p>
<p>“It’s one of the worst performances in history as a U.S. team,”
Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian ever and part of the NBC
broadcast team in Paris, said Monday. “Something’s got to happen before
2028 because if you have a repeat like this, it’s gonna be even more
embarrassing.”  </p>
<p>Notably, the rest of the world totaled more victories (20) than the
United States and Australia combined, the first time that’s happened
since the 1996 Atlanta Games.  </p>
<p>The Americans will certainly be intent on improving their performance
heading into the home games at Los Angeles in 2028, when swimming will
have in its largest, most spectacular setting yet — a temporary pool
inside SoFi Stadium with a capacity for some 38,000 fans.  </p>
<p>Still, with more and more international swimmers getting their
training in the U.S. — and prominent American coaches such as Bob Bowman
spreading their knowledge to other countries — a more diverse list of
gold medalists is likely to be the norm going forward.  </p>
<p>“This sport is growing and I can’t help but feel like we’ve been a
part of that,” American gold medalist Bobby Finke said. “It’s something
we should take home and be proud of.”  </p>
<p>Two of the biggest swimming stars in Paris, France’s Léon Marchand
and Canada’s Summer McIntosh, train in the U.S. but won a bevy of medals
for their home countries.  </p>
<p>Marchand, who captured four individual golds as well as a relay
bronze, is coached by Bowman, best known as the guy who guided Michael
Phelps throughout his record-setting career. It was a bit strange to see
Bowman in a France shirt, working on the coaching staff of Marchand’s
nation.  </p>
<p>After a break to savor his Olympic triumph, Marchand will return to
the U.S. to continue his work with Bowman, who now heads the swimming
program at the University of Texas.  </p>
<p>“Look at Bob Bowman. He doesn’t care if you’re from the USA or
whatever,” said Shane Ryan, an American-born swimmer who competes for
Ireland. “He just wants to coach the fastest swimmers at all
times.”  </p>
<p>McIntosh trains with a team in Sarasota, Florida, where she honed the
form that produced three individual gold medals — the most ever by a
Canadian athlete — and a silver.  </p>
<p>“I think competition is great,” said longtime American stalwart Ryan
Murphy, who trains with several international athletes at Cal-Berkeley
including Spain’s Hugo González. “He’s pushed me a lot. There’s plenty
of days where he’s right next to me and helping me get better.”  </p>
<p>Murphy said it’s only natural in today’s information-driven world
that more nations are rising up to challenge the U.S.   </p>
<p>“People will take a video of what they’re doing in practice and put
it up on social media right away,” he said. “The learning curve is so
quick around the world. That’s a big reason why there’s so many talented
athletes across the world now.”  </p>
<p>The U.S. certainly has its shining moments in Paris.  </p>
<p>Katie Ledecky won two more golds, moving her into a tie for second
place among all athletes on the career list with nine. She also joined
Phelps as the only swimmers to win the same event at four straight
Summer Games with her victory in the 800-meter freestyle.  </p>
<p>The women’s team produced several more stars, including Torri Huske
(three golds, two silvers), Gretchen Walsh (two golds, two silvers) and
Regan Smith (two golds, three silvers).  </p>
<p>But there were plenty of disappointments, particular on the men’s
side.  </p>
<p>Caeleb Dressel, a big star at the Tokyo Games with five gold medals,
finished sixth in the 50 freestyle and didn’t even qualify for the final
of the 100 butterfly.  </p>
<p>Murphy settled for a bronze in the 100 backstroke and, like Dressel,
failed to qualify for the final of his other individual event, the 200
back.  </p>
<p>In all, the American men produced only two gold medals, and they
didn’t pick up an individual victory until Finke’s world record in the
1,500 freestyle on the final night.   </p>
<p>“You always want to be better,” said Anthony Nesty, head coach of the
men’s team. “Yes, we want our athletes to win gold medals, but the other
teams have great athletes as well. We have to go back, all the coaches
in the U.S., get back on it and hopefully four years from now we have a
better result. From the men, for sure.”  </p>
<p>The depth of the American team remains its biggest strength. Even
with four of its most prominent stars — Dressel, Murphy, Lilly King and
Simone Manuel — managing only one individual medal (Murphy’s bronze in
the 100 back), the U.S. easily led the overall medals table with
28.  </p>
<p>Three of the four world records set at the meet came from the
Americans, two of them in relays.  </p>
<p>“Whether our athletes won a gold medal or failed to make a semifinal
or whatever it might be,” said U.S. women’s coach Todd DeSorbo, “you’ve
got to learn from it, go back home and be better.”</p>

economic aide Sperling leaving White House to work on Harris
campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — White House senior adviser Gene Sperling is leaving his
administration position to work with Vice President Kamala Harris’
election campaign as the Democrats step up efforts to challenge Donald
Trump on policy issues in November’s election.</p>
<p>Sperling will be a senior economic adviser to Harris’ policy team.
The shift was revealed by White House officials who spoke on condition
of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.</p>
<p>Sperling served both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama as director of the
White House National Economic Council. President Joe Biden tasked
Sperling with managing his $1.9 trillion pandemic aid package, a role in
which Sperling implemented the temporary expansion of the child tax
credit. He was also the White House liaison to the union and car
companies during the auto strikes.</p>
<p>“Under Gene’s leadership, the American Rescue Plan has delivered
economic relief to cities and counties across the country, protected
millions of union pensions, made the largest-ever federal investment in
public safety, and kept thousands of small businesses afloat,” Biden
said in a statement obtained by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Sperling first worked with Harris when she was California attorney
general during his time in the Obama administration. He frequently
consulted with her as an outside adviser when she was in the Senate. The
two partnered during the Biden presidency on promoting the monthly
payments for the child tax credit, among other policies.</p>
<p>The pandemic programs halved child poverty with tax credits that went
to 40 million families and provided rental assistance to 8 million.</p>
<p>But Republican critics blame the pandemic aid for sparking higher
inflation, an issue that has hounded the Biden administration as many
voters say that groceries, housing and gasoline have become less
affordable. Financial markets opened Monday with a selloff as a weaker
than expected jobs report last week has raised concerns about the U.S.
economy’s resilience.</p>
<p>The White House has maintained that the inflation was global in
nature, with chief of staff Jeff Zients saying that the efforts
coordinated by Sperling “produced the strongest economy in the
world.”</p>
<p>North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, described the work
that Sperling spearheaded as “generational investments” and credited him
working with states to get the programs right.</p>

abroad help countries grow women’s basketball for Olympic
opportunity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>VILLENEUVE-D’ASCQ, France — Germany has lots of players who can
score. The Germans knew they needed a point guard for the Paris Games
with the country making its Olympic debut in women’s basketball.  </p>
<p>Alexis Peterson, a native of Columbus, Ohio, has proven to be a
perfect fit.  </p>
<p>The guard who played at Syracuse in college has helped Germany
qualify for Wednesday’s quarterfinals in Paris, and German coach Lisa
Thomaidis said Peterson has been everything they wanted. </p>
<p>“Ball control, that’s always been the issue for us,” Thomaidis said.
“We’ve had to kind of do it by committee. We’ve never really had a true
point guard. We’ve been able to, you know, do it OK. But to get to that
next level? We knew that she was someone that would be a huge
help.”  </p>
<p>Peterson’s not the only American abroad in these Olympics playing for
other countries. The reason? The stacked pipeline of U.S. talent is
essentially impossible to crack, and a FIBA rule allows countries to tap
players with dual citizenships or a player who becomes a naturalized
citizen.  </p>
<p>For Peterson, it’s been a long road.  </p>
<p>Now 29, she was drafted 15th overall in 2017 by the WNBA’s Seattle
Storm. She spent six seasons bouncing around the WNBA from Indiana,
Phoenix and the Las Vegas Aces. She’s played in Israel, Poland and
France.  </p>
<p>Then Germany and Thomaidis reached out to Peterson last summer to
gauge her interest. She had represented the U.S. in 3x3 basketball, so
USA Basketball and the German Basketball Association agreed to a change
of Peterson’s nationality so she could play for Germany.  </p>
<p>“If you recall, like Las Vegas head coach Becky Hammon played for
Russia,” Peterson said of the Aces coach. “So it’s been happening for a
while. Players find opportunities elsewhere and make the most of those
opportunities. So I’m grateful that I was given this opportunity.”  </p>
<p>Peterson has lots of company at these Games playing for other
countries.  </p>
<p>Yvonne Anderson was born in Springdale, Arkansas, and is the daughter
of college coach Mike Anderson. The point guard will be playing in her
second straight Olympic quarterfinals for Serbia against Australia on
Wednesday. She helped Serbia finish fourth three years ago in the Tokyo
Games. </p>
<p>Then, Anderson was fitting into a new team, figuring out her role.
Time has made a big difference. </p>
<p>“At this point, I have a bond with the team,” said Anderson, who has
been wearing a mask protecting the nose she broke earlier this year.
“This is my family. Like, these are my girls. This is my team.” </p>
<p>Megan Gustafson from Port Wing, Wisconsin, played at Iowa and was the
2019 AP women’s player of the year. The 6-foot-4 Gustafson currently is

<p>Germany wants to make a splash in these Games as a big step toward

Temperatures may still be scorching, but hey, at least you probably
don’t have to swim in the Seine.
</p>
<h3>
Don’t get used to cooler temperatures
</h3>
<p>
The Midwest cooled off a bit over the weekend — but doesn’t mean extreme
temperatures are behind us. <strong>More heat is in store this week for
the Central Plains and the deep South. </strong>A heat dome developing
in the Western side of the country will push hot air over to those
regions, Bryan Jackson, a National Weather Service meteorologist, told
me.
</p>
<p>
“Cities like Denver, Oklahoma City and Kansas City will have
temperatures ranging from 95 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit the rest of the
work week. That’s 6 to 12 degrees above historical averages,” Paul
Pastelok, a senior meteorologist at Accuweather, told me.
</p>
<p>
The conditions in the Southern Plains across the Gulf States into the
interior Southeast will be <strong>even more extreme</strong>, as high
humidity levels will make already high temperatures in cities like
Houston, Memphis, Tennessee, Jackson, Mississippi feel 8 to 10 degrees
hotter, Pastelok explained. To be clear, that means heat indexes as high
as 110.
</p>
<p>
Over in the West, the heat will focus over eastern Oregon, southern
Idaho, Nevada, and central and southern California. According to
Pastelok, Boise, Idaho, will see temperatures above 100 degrees for most
of this week — 8 to 14 degrees above historical averages.
</p>
<h3>
Olympians are having more trouble staying cool than winning medals
</h3>
<p>
Beyond sleeping in cardboard beds and swimming in the Seine (which is
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/04/g-s1-15326/belgian-olympic-swimmer-seine-e-coli-triathlet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>potentially
still full of E.coli</u></a>), athletes are having to deal with the
intense heat in the city.
</p>
<p>
In 2021,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/olympic-athletes-and-volunteers-in-tokyo-tortured-by-heat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Tokyo
became the hottest Olympic Games ever</u></a>, with daily highs
averaging nearly 90 degrees and the heat index soaring well past 113
degrees. While Paris won’t come close to challenging that, it’s still
been plenty hot. Temperatures in the French capital
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-paris-heat-wave-4ca791e7219d3efb5ba4e84c6d7f8999" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reached
97 degrees</u></a> last Tuesday before settling back into the
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/fr/paris/623/august-weather/623" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high
70s</u></a> over the weekend.
</p>
<p>
To counter the heat, athletes were taking extra breaks to hydrate, but
sometimes not even that was enough. “We were drinking hot water out
there,” British tennis player Jack Draper told
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/paris-olympics-bracing-heat-wave-soggy-start-112393417" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ABC
News</u></a>. USA gymnast-slash-golden girl Simone Biles also complained
about the heat and having to go around in a bus without AC. Spectators
also struggled, and volunteers had to use a water hose to spray those in
the bleachers at a beach volleyball game.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> After a cooler weekend, temperatures in
Paris will trend warmer again early this week. <strong>The city will
likely see temperatures above 86 degrees today and tomorrow</strong>,
Jason Nicholls, lead international forecaster at Accuweather, told me.
That same cycle will repeat again from mid-week through Friday. One spot
of good news, though, for those toughing it out in the City of Lights:
You’re likely already through the worst of it.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Park Fire rages
</h3>
<p>
The Park Fire is now the
<a href="https://34c031f8-c9fd-4018-8c5a-4159cdff6b0d-cdn-endpoint.azureedge.net/-/media/calfire-website/our-impact/fire-statistics/top-20-largest-ca-wildfires.pdf?rev=91666785545f4a0783b060277fb340f0&hash=B4502FE6A177E89863B51DEEF49C2F58" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fourth
largest wildfire</u></a> in California’s history — <strong>and there
might still be weeks before it’s quenched</strong>. As of this morning,
only 31% of the fire had been contained, with one more county being
added to the evacuation list. Hundreds of structures have been
destroyed, and over 400,000 acres have been burned.
</p>
<p>
Looking at California’s fire season to date, the numbers are even more
shocking. During the summer of 2023, the state responded to 119 wildfire
incidents. So far this summer — and remember we still have all of August
to go — the state has already responded to <em><em>321
wildfires</em></em>, according to
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/our-impact/statistics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cal
Fire data</u></a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead: </strong>The chances of putting out the Park Fire
this week are low, as “precipitation is not in the forecast to help
firefighters,” Pastelok told me. <strong>Dry thunderstorms and gusty
winds</strong> coming from the south to southwest predicted for this
week will also make the fire harder to contain. New wildfires in the
region can also be expected.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
“Extended summer” will last into fall
</h3>
<p>
The first couple of weeks of August will continue to see much of the
same extreme heat the country has experienced so far this summer,
according to Pastelok. In fact, the Southeast looks to be getting even
hotter and more humid late this week and into next. In northern
California and parts of Oregon, some cooling may happen around the
middle of the month, but not enough to end the wildfire season.
<strong>More significant opportunities for cooler weather in the region
won’t start until September — or even October. </strong>
</p>
<p>
Seattle and Portland may get lucky with a more substantial drop in
temperatures later in August, but the Northeast will continue hot and
humid throughout all of this month. The location of the cooler weather
will mostly be determined by storms, Pastelok explained. “If more storms
hit the East coast, the cooling will drive into the Midwest,” he said.
“If the storms drive into the Gulf, then warmth will remain back to the
Midwest and cooling will be more confined to the northern Rockies and
Northwest.”
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> From September through November,
meteorologists at AccuWeather expect temperatures to be 1 to 3 degrees
above historical averages. <strong>The only region that will be spared
is the Pacific Northwest</strong>, where cooler, wetter weather will pop
up earlier. This also means that the risk of extreme weather events,
such as tornadoes and wildfires, will continue high through the end of
the year.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
The coldest place on the planet is not even that cold anymore
</h3>
<p>
Not even Antarctica is safe from bizarre temperatures this summer.
<strong>Last month, an intense heat wave caused temperatures across the
continent to average up to 50 degrees above normal.</strong>
Temperatures were up 82 degrees from historical readings on some days.
</p>
<p>
The numbers confirm what climate scientists have been telling us for
years: Climate change will be most intensely perceived in the polar
regions, making temperatures soar even higher in the rest of the globe.
Zeke Hausfather, a researcher at Berkeley Earth, told
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/01/antarctic-temperatures-rise-10c-above-average-in-near-record-heatwave" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
Guardian</em></em></u></a> that the heat wave in Antarctica was one of
the main factors behind the scorching temperatures in the last few
weeks.
</p>
<h3>
Extreme weather sends China from drought to drowning
</h3>
<p>
Now major cities in China are also struggling under boiling heat.
<strong>Shanghai issued its first red warning alert — the most severe
temperature alert in the country — for the year last Thursday</strong>;
the next day, temperatures along the country’s eastern coast hit 104
degrees. On August 3, the city of Hangzhou faced a high of almost 107
degrees, breaking its previous record set in 2022. Warnings have also
been issued for the provinces of Fujian, Anhui, Jiangsu, among others,
and intense heat is expected to continue through this week.
</p>
<p>
In Henan province, which had been battling a severe drought after months
of no rain, the situation has taken a turn. In late July, the province
was hit by a brutal typhoon, leading to the evacuation of tens of
thousands.
</p>
<p>
This year, China recorded its hottest July in history.

Boston archbishop, ally of sex abuse victims, retires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Rome — U.S. Cardinal Sean O’Malley, known for championing survivors
of sexual abuse and pushing the Catholic Church to reform, is stepping
down as the Archbishop of Boston, the Vatican announced Monday.   </p>
<p>The 80-year-old will be replaced by Richard Henning, the 59-year-old
bishop of Providence, to helm the fourth-largest diocese in the United
States, the Vatican said in a statement.   </p>
<p>It did not give a reason, saying only that Pope Francis had accepted
O’Malley’s resignation.   </p>
<p>In the Catholic Church, bishops who lead a diocese have a traditional
retirement age of 75, but the pope has the discretion to ask them to
stay on longer.   </p>
<p>For now, O’Malley remains head of the Pontifical Commission for the
Protection of Minors, a body created by Pope Francis to fight pedophilia
by priests that the bishop has led since 2014.  </p>
<p>O’Malley’s resignation ends a two-decade chapter leading Catholics in
the largely Irish and Italian city of Boston, where the global scandal
over child sex abuse by clergy erupted in 2002, the year before he
arrived.   </p>
<p>An ally of Francis, O’Malley is part of the Franciscan mendicant
order, Friars Minor Capuchin, and spent his early years as a priest
building bridges with the immigrant Hispanic community in the diocese of
Washington DC.   </p>
<p>Before arriving in Boston, O’Malley served as bishop of Saint Thomas,
a diocese covering all the US Virgin Islands, and later of Fall River,
Massachusetts, south of Boston.   </p>
<p>In Fall River and the diocese of Palm Beach, Florida, he managed the
fall-out of scandals involving the sexual abuse of minors by priests.
 </p>
<p>But it was in Boston where O’Malley came to prominence, managing what
was then the highest-profile US clerical sex abuse scandal, later
depicted in the Academy Award-winning film, “Spotlight.”    </p>
<p>Recognized for his rapport with victims and his speed in settling
cases, under O’Malley’s watch the archdiocese agreed to pay $85 million
to settle nearly 550 victim lawsuits.</p>

id="simone-biles-finishes-off-her-return-to-the-olympics-with-a-silver-on-floor-exercise">Simone
Biles finishes off her return to the Olympics with a silver on floor
exercise</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Paris — American gymnast Simone Biles didn’t get the golden sendoff
she hoped. </p>
<p>Biles earned silver in the floor exercise finals on Monday — her 11th
Olympic medal — after a routine that included a couple of costly steps
out of bounds. </p>
<p>Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade became the first gymnast to beat Biles in a
floor final in a major international competition, posting a score of
14.166 that finished just ahead of Biles at 14.133. </p>
<p>Jordan Chiles, a longtime friend of Biles, earned the bronze. </p>
<p>The 27-year-old Biles, considered the greatest in the history of the
sport, wasn’t at her usual best during a routine set to music from pop
icons Taylor Swift and Beyonce. </p>
<p>Still, she boosted her medal haul in Paris to four, gold in the team,
all-around and vault finals and a silver that came as a surprise in her
signature event. </p>
<p>Biles’ medal total (including seven gold, two silver, two bronze)
ties Czechoslovakia’s Vera Caslavska for the second-most by a female
gymnast in Olympic history. She missed a chance to add a fifth Paris
medal earlier Monday when she fell during the beam final, finishing
fifth. </p>
<p>Though she can make it look easy at times, it is not. She thudded to
the floor during her floor warm-up and had the balky left calf she
tweaked in qualifying re-wrapped before she competed. </p>
<p>Her tumbling passes weren’t perfect — she stepped out of bounds twice
— but her difficulty is usually so far above everyone else that it
hardly matters. </p>
<p>Not this time. She received a 7.833 execution score that included 0.6
in deductions for stepping out of bounds, allowing Andrade to win her
second Olympic gold. </p>
<p>Still, wearing a red-white-and-blue leotard featuring thousands of
crystals, Biles ended nine days of competition in Paris by silencing the
critics once and for all who have long derided her for pulling out of
multiple events at the Tokyo Games three years ago. </p>
<p>She won four medals in all, just one less than she did eight years
ago in Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p>Chiles — the last competitor of the day — initially received a 13.666
from judges. After some delay, her total was boosted by 0.1 when she
filed an inquiry about her difficulty score, pushing Chiles past
Romanians Ana Barbosu and Sabrina Maneca-Voinea and into third.</p>

<h2 id="world-stocks-plunge-on-fears-of-us-economic-slowdown">World
stocks plunge on fears of US economic slowdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Stock markets across the globe plunged Monday as investors
sold stocks on worries that the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, might
be slowing and possibly headed to a recession. </p>
<p>In afternoon trading, all three major U.S. indexes — the Dow Jones
Industrial Average of 30 blue chip stocks, the broader S&amp;P 500 index
and the tech-heavy NASDAQ — were still down more than 2% after
sustaining even steeper declines earlier in the day. </p>
<p>In Europe, the Pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell 1.5%, rallying from
a larger dip earlier in the day, as every major market in Europe
declined. The FTSE 100, Britain’s benchmark index, dipped just over 2%,
its worst day since July 2023. </p>
<p>The sell-off started in Japan, with the Nikkei 225 index suffering
its largest single-day point drop in history, ending the day down a
staggering 12.4% — drawing comparisons to the “Black Monday” stock
market crash of 1987. Other Asian markets also fell. </p>
<p>Monday’s sell-off began last week after a monthly U.S. jobs report
showed significantly slower hiring, with 114,000 new jobs in July, far
fewer than had been forecasted and sharply down from recent months.
Unemployment rose to 4.3%, its highest level in nearly three years. </p>
<p>The two pieces of data spooked investors, deepening fears that the
U.S. economy could be sliding into a recession and that the Federal
Reserve may have waited too long to cut its benchmark rate. It has
delayed any rate cut until September, when the central bank’s policy
makers are expected to trim the key rate that sets the standard for
interest charges on many business and consumer loans. </p>
<p>The Fed last week held its benchmark rate at a two-decade high, where
it has remained for a year. </p>
<p>In a new assessment, the Goldman Sachs investment company said it now
expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its next three meetings — in
September, November and December. Goldman raised its forecast for the
probability of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months from 15% to
25%. </p>
<p>Because it encompasses 500 stocks, Standard &amp; Poor’s index is
often considered a key barometer of the U.S. economy. It has fallen
sharply in recent days, but it is still up about 9% percent for the
year. At its peak in mid-July, it was up 19%.</p>
<p>Trading in Japan was suspended to prevent panic selling after the
decline triggered circuit breakers designed to contain severe market
drops. The frenzy also activated circuit breakers in South Korea, where
the main market finished nearly 9% lower. </p>
<p>In Taiwan, stocks plunged more than 8% — the worst single-day
percentage drop in the island’s history. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company — the world’s largest chipmaker — fell nearly
10%. </p>
<p>Aside from fears about the U.S. economy, geopolitical tensions
frequently draw concerns for investors, too, including last week’s
assassination in Iran of Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas’ top political leader.
Iran has blamed Israel for the attack, and vowed retaliation, raising
fears of a regional war. </p>
<p>The market plunge has been most severe in Japan, which analysts said
was experiencing a market correction after many investors relied on a
historically cheap yen and rock-bottom interest rates to fund risky
investments. That strategy was exposed after Japan last week raised
benchmark interest rates for only the second time in 17 years and hinted
that such rate hikes may continue. </p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a civilization-altering crash,” said Khoon Goh,
head of Asia research at ANZ. “It’s just to me a simple case of market
participants getting way ahead and, I guess you can argue, greedy, in
over-leveraging, thinking that cheap and free money in Japan was going
to be here to stay. And that has gone badly wrong, and they are having
to very quickly unwind it and it’s having knock-on effects into asset
markets.”   </p>
<p>In an interview with VOA, Goh downplayed concerns about a U.S.
recession. </p>
<p>“I think it’s a little bit unfair to blame the (U.S.) Fed for being
late or behind the curve, because until recently a lot of people were
thinking that the U.S. economy was still in reasonably good shape. And
no one was really ringing the recession alarm bells,” he said.    </p>
<p>Two years ago, the Fed started increasing borrowing costs to curb
inflation, which had caused prices to soar for essentials like rent and
food. Since then, it has aimed for a “soft landing,” seeking to control
inflation without causing an economic recession. </p>
<p>In a commentary published Monday, BMI – A Fitch Solutions Company,
said, “The Fed has significant fire power and can cut rates quite
aggressively to support growth if needed.” </p>
<p>BMI said that while global markets have been more volatile than
expected, they had recently rallied sharply and were vulnerable to a
sell-off.  </p>
<p>“Corrections of 5-10% are fairly common during bull markets and
typically, there is a seasonal pick up in equity volatility during the
July-October period,” it added.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
With all the attention paid to electric vehicles and heat pumps, the
2020s might seem like the decade of home electrification — but nothing
might ever rival the boom of the original Roaring Twenties. By 1929, 70%
of all American homes had access to electricity,
<a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/the-birth-of-the-grid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>double
the figure</u></a> from the beginning of the decade – bringing home
electrification from minority to majority.
</p>
<p>
Home electrification was so big back then, it even had a mascot: Reddy
Kilowatt. Invented by a marketer at the Alabama Power Company in 1926,
this cheery spokescharacter with a lightning-bolt body and a lightbulb
nose was licensed to hundreds of utility companies throughout the
greater part of the 20th century to promote electricity – and more
specifically investor–owned utilities. Reddy was even used as a tool to
<a href="https://sirismm.si.edu/EADpdfs/NMAH.AC.0913.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>link
government-owned utilities to socialism</u></a> or communism in years
following World War II.

I first came across Reddy Kilowatt last year when a climate tech peer
emailed me an image of him, probably from the 1950s, powering everything
from a hot water heater to a record player with the headline “Your
<em><em>all</em></em> Electric Home.”
</p>

</p>
<p>
For weeks I couldn’t stop thinking about that headline because I kept
hearing people in the decarbonization movement say similar things (does
<em><em>Electrify Everything</em></em> ring a bell?). Itching to learn
more of the history of Reddy, I reached out to an expert.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsten_Moana_Thompson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Dr. Kirsten
Moana Thompson</u></a> is a professor at Seattle University who teaches
and writes about animation. Her
<a href="https://www.academia.edu/42902661/Live_Electrically_with_Reddy_Kilowatt_Your_Electrical_Servant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>paper</u></a>,
<em><em>Live Electrically with Reddy Kilowatt, Your Electrical
Servant</em></em>, explores the history of this “phenomenally successful
and ubiquitous spokescharacter.”
</p>
<p>
I chatted with Dr. Moana Thompson over a video call from her office
where a framed illustration of Reddy Kilowatt hung behind her. I went
into the call thinking about positioning this article, “Is America ready
for another Reddy?,” but by the end I learned he may be best left in the
1900s. The following interview was edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mike Munsell</strong>
</p>
<p>
Can you introduce yourself and tell me how you ended up researching
Reddy Kilowatt?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dr. Kirsten Moana Thompson:</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m a professor and chair of the film and media department at Seattle
University, and Reddy Kilowatt was part of my research into animation
that has been used in sponsored media — that is media used for
non-traditional, non-entertainment purposes to do something else, like
sell something, instruct you, persuade you. It forms a chapter in what
will be a new book coming out in the next couple of years on animation
and advertising. I think Reddy Kilowatt is a great example of how
popular it was in the post-war period to use animated spokescharacters
to sell products or ideas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell:</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m curious: Are animated mascots less prevalent today than back in the
post-war period?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson:</strong>
</p>
<p>
My research doesn’t focus on the contemporary era, so I couldn’t give
you a precise example. But certainly, as late as the ’70s, animation
characters still were extensively used to promote products, not just
cereal, and toys, but things like bubble bath and candy and, well into
the ’70s, alcohol as well.
</p>
<p>
There are lots of reasons for that, because certain types of animation
were fairly cheap to produce, were appealing, often comedic, and
attention grabbing. They were a great means to sell a product — also
great to use for abstract or more complex processes, like, how do you
make oil or petrol or gas? How do you convey a concept like capitalism?
Animation, as opposed to live action, was often a more successful way to
convey or target topics of that nature.
</p>
<p>
We have to anthropomorphize the things that are too abstract, too
conceptual, or too inhuman to make them translatable into something that
we can comprehend and relate to. Hence the Geico lizard or the Aflac
duck.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell </strong>
</p>
<p>
And that makes sense then for Reddy Kilowatt to advertise electricity
back when it was new, right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes, it really emerged around the time electrification was in two thirds
of American households — by 1930. And electrical utility companies
needed to find an appealing way to sell their product and to encourage
consumer consumption of things like appliances, which themselves were
emerging — things like dishwashers and washing machines and hair dryers
and so on. But also rural electrification, and electrification for
business purposes and factories, and on farms.
</p>
<p>
[Reddy Kilowatt] emerged targeting a fairly affluent consumer, by, for
example, turning electricity into a servant – an abstract servant that
was personalized and anthropomorphized.
</p>
<p>
But it was also a way of rather cleverly justifying rate increases as
well, which occurred a little later, by making Reddy Kilowatt literally
a figure that earns wages and was regarded as an employee by many
electrical utility companies. So it’s a clever way to say to people,
<em><em>hey, everybody deserves a wage and Reddy Kilowatt deserves a
wage and prices are going up, so we’re going to put his wages up. And
that’s a fair thing</em></em>.

<p>
<strong>Munsell:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Smithsonian has a huge collection of Reddy Kilowatt material. Did
you get to go check that out?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson: </strong>
</p>
<p>
Yes, I did. The archives are extensive. And so you can read all about
how [Reddy Kilowatt creator] Ashton Collins promoted the product, and
what the kinds of speeches that he gave to many other business companies
and electrical utility companies in the 30s and 40s.
</p>
<p>
But he’s part of a wider movement. There are other leading figures like
Walt Disney and Walter Lantz, who were animation studio heads. Walter
Lantz, of course, ran what he would pick the Walter Lantz studios that
produced Woody Woodpecker and Andy Panda, and a number of other popular
cartoons of the 40s. And Walt Disney, of course, we’re all familiar
with. But they all believed that the kinds of skills that animation
studios were doing in the 1940s — by making cartoons to train troops to
operate machinery or rifles, and by making propaganda to translate the
values of the fight for democracy against fascism — they believed that
those skills could be applied to the commercial market in the post-war
period. And that animation was a key element of visual culture that
could translate to a sometimes illiterate population or partially
illiterate population.
</p>
<p>
So Ashton Collins is not alone there. He’s part of a broader movement in
the film industry and in the animation industry, to understand the
unique power of animation to communicate and to sell and persuade.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell</strong>
</p>
<p>
Did you find anything in your research particularly surprising?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
In addition to extensive print materials in the Smithsonian, you see
dozens and dozens of objects that featured Reddy Kilowatt. His image is

Reddy Kilowatt collection</u></a>]
</p>
<p>
It was used in the 1939 World’s Fair, for example, to communicate and to
encourage the public to interact with Reddy Kilowatt as if it was a real
figure. I was quite taken with this – it’s really an early form of
animatronics. They were using an avatar, a spokescharacter, who was
fairly ubiquitous in the American home, on people’s electricity bills,
and combining it with a large three dimensional object with a record
player attached and somebody who operated the speaking, to interact with
kids at fairs and to communicate basic ideas. So that was really
exciting in a way because it shows how ahead of its time Ashton Collins
was at understanding interactivity.

<p>
I was thinking about copyright and trademark law and the public domain.
Reddy Kilowatt was, in his original form, created in 1926. We’re coming
up on that 100 year mark. Is there a chance he enters the public domain?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Dr. Moana Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m not sure about that. Because you can renew copyright. Which of
course Disney did repeatedly before it finally had to succumb to the end
of copyright. And Reddy is also a trademark as opposed to a copyrighted
image. So he has not just appeared in what is public access now, some of
his films and TV commercials, but he’s also a trademark figure that has
a continuing commercial currency. And Ashton Collins was absolutely
rigorous at paying attention to trademark law. He sued other companies
that had similar characters,

I suspect that Xcel Energy [who now owns the rights to Reddy Kilowatt]
is going to be very strict in policing its trademarks. Because if this
product has value as a commodity of nostalgia for a certain generation,
or multiple generations, or even if it has a new function in Xcel’s
future corporate identity, he’s going to have value.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell</strong>
</p>
<p>
I guess your research sort of doesn’t get quite into the present day,
but for my understanding Reddy Kilowatt is not really used much today.
It was used by a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOVffAeAmII" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>utility
in Barbados</u></a> and an Ecuadorian
<a href="https://x.com/CSEmelec/status/1553379897229410304" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>soccer
club</u></a> more recently, but from your understanding do you know why
he stopped being used?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong><br/>
</p>
<p>
Well, I’m not sure that he stopped being used. I have seen the return of
Reddy Kilowatt as a consumer figure and as a licensed product that
appears on T-shirts and stickers. Amazon has been selling quite a lot of
Reddy Kilowatt products. So it’s possible that Xcel Energy that owns the
trademark sees the value of the product for a new market, which is the
nostalgic market, where you can sell a cartoon character itself.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell: </strong>I do think that with the emergence of heat
pumps, and induction stoves, there is a push toward home electrification
and moving away from fossil fuels in your home. I wonder if that’s an
opportunity for a reemergence of Reddy?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
Yeah, it could be an opportunity for them to repurpose the trademark.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Munsell</strong><br/>
</p>
<p>
Is there anything else you wanted to add about your research into Reddy?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thompson</strong>
</p>
<p>
I thought it was interesting, the blend that Reddy Kilowatt had of both
the impersonal and the personal. On the one hand, we’ve mostly been
talking about it as this cute cartoony character of appeal and
personality. But on the other hand, he represents an abstract concept,
which is almost robotic. He was literally a robot as part of his
marketing. This concept of the kilowatt as one and a half horsepower was
part of this wider discursive emergence in the ’20s that electricity was
both a servant, as an anthropomorphized figure, and an abstraction that
is there at the flick of a switch.
</p>
<p>
And in their marketing, they used imagery that of course would never be
used today. The association of kilowatt as both a
“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coolie</u></a>”
– which was the specific language used – and a slave.
</p>
<p>
So this kind of racist imagery is interesting because it gets to the
roots of this idea of the dehumanized, depersonalized aspects of Reddy
Kilowatt – that electricity represented by using this imagery, and they
had little pictures of kilowatt, which were described as a slave or a
“coolie” to explain that, basically, this was free labor and unlimited
labor. So obviously addressed to an implicitly white consumer. [The idea
that] racial imagery of course affected all kinds of aspects of American
advertising is well known to scholars in this field and often played on
imagery of blackness or whiteness, in the case of soap advertising, for
example, but Reddy Kilowatt in particular is this machinic identity.
</p>
<p>
And who knows, maybe that’ll come back again in the future, because
machines are so much more part of our lives now, as compared to 1926 or
the mid century with computers and artificial intelligence.

landfall</a> in Florida’s Big Bend region this morning as a category 1
storm. It is expected to be extremely dangerous, not necessarily because
of its wind speeds but because of the water it will dump over
southeastern states in the coming days. Forecasters are warning of
life-threatening storm surge, severe flash flooding, as well as strong
winds. Up to 18 inches of rain could fall along the coast throughout the
week, from Georgia through the Carolinas. If the storm stalls after it
hits land, it is likely to strengthen and drop even more rain. Debby is
the fourth named storm of the season and is making landfall in the same
region Hurricane Idalia hit a year ago. Scientists agree climate change
is heating the oceans, which is making tropical storms wetter and
stronger.

look at their climate track records:

program to cut state emissions and lower electricity bills. He secured a
$369 million federal grant to cut industrial emissions and create 6,000
jobs. Environmentalists aren’t jazzed about his murky history on
fracking. As state attorney general, he investigated the gas drilling
industry on fracking dangers, but as governor, “he’s become more
friendly to drilling,” wrote Mike Soraghan at
<em><em>Politico</em></em>. Harris might see that as a good thing,
though, as Donald Trump tries to target her for being anti-fracking.

<li>
<strong>Walz </strong>– With a keen understanding of what it will take
to get Americans on board with climate policies, Walz is “one of the
country’s most skillful climate communicators,”

feature</a> on David Keith, a professor in the University of Chicago’s
department of geophysical sciences and a longtime proponent of solar
geoengineering. Keith makes his case for the contentious and still
experimental idea of spraying sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere to
lower global temperatures. He admits the process comes with risks, but
says these are “quantitatively small compared to the benefits.” Yes, the
practice could make twilight look different (more orange), but daylight
would otherwise probably look the same.

The article quotes Frank Keutsch, one of Keith’s collaborators on a

only treat the symptom and not the actual cause,” Keutsch said. “You can
get addicted to it if you don’t actually address the cause. In addition,
like any painkiller, you’re going to have side effects. And then there
are withdrawal symptoms, and that’s termination shock.”

<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Not too long ago I linked to a blog post by long-time OSNews reader
(and silver Patreon) and friend of mine Morgan, about how to set up
OpenBSD as a workstation operating system – and in fact, I personally
used that guide in my own OpenBSD journey. Well, Morgan’s back with
another, similar article, this time covering FreeBSD. After going
through the basic steps needed to make FreeBSD a bit more amenable to
desktop use, Morgan notes about performance: Now let’s compare FreeBSD.
Well, quite frankly, there is no comparison! FreeBSD just feels snappier
and more responsive on the desktop; at the same 170Hz refresh it
actually feels like 170Hz. Void Linux always felt fast enough and I
thought it had no lag at all at that refresh rate, but comparing them
side by side (FreeBSD installed on the NVMe drive, Void running from a
USB 4 SSD with similar performance), FreeBSD is smooth as glass and I
started noticing just the slightest lag/stutter on Void. The same holds
true for Firefox; I use smooth scrolling and on FreeBSD it really is
perfectly smooth. Similarly, Youtube performance is unreal, with no
dropped frames at any resolution all the way up to 4Kp60, and the videos
look so much smoother! ↫ Morgan/kaidenshi This is especially relevant
for me personally, since the prime reason I switched my workstation back
to Fedora KDE was OpenBSD’s performance issues. While those performance
issues were entirely expected and the result of the operating system’s
focus on security and hardening, it did mean it’s just not suitable for
me as a workstation operating system, even if I like the internals and
find it a joy to use, even under the hood. If FreeBSD delivers more
solid desktop and workstation performance, it might be time I set up a
FreeBSD KDE installation and see if it can handle my workstation’s 270Hz
4K display. As I keep reiterating – the BSD world has a lot to offer
those wishing to run a UNIX-like workstation operating system, and it’s
articles like these that help people get started. A lot of the steps
taken may seem elementary to many of us, but for people coming from
Linux or even Windows, they may be unfamiliar and daunting, so having it
all laid out in a straightforward manner is quite helpful.</p>

Debby to bring heavy rain, catastrophic flooding to Florida, Georgia, S.
Carolina</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAMPA, FLORIDA — The center of Hurricane Debby is expected to reach
the Big Bend coast of Florida early Monday bringing potential
record-setting rains, catastrophic flooding and life-threatening storm
surge as it moves slowly across the northern part of the state before
stalling over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Debby was located about 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Cedar Key,
Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph). The storm was
moving north at 12 mph (19 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami
said early Monday.</p>
<p>Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season
after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris,
all of which formed in June.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned heavy amounts of rain from Debby could spawn
catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia.</p>
<p>The storm was expected to make landfall around midday Monday in the
Big Bend area of Florida, north of Tampa, the hurricane center said. A
tornado watch also was in effect for parts of Florida and Georgia until
6 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>“Right now, we are trying secure everything from floating away,” said
Sheryl Horne, whose family owns the Shell Island Fish Camp along the
Wakulla River in St. Marks, Florida, where some customers moved their
boats inland. The sparsely populated Big Bend region in the Florida
Panhandle was hit last year by Hurricane Idalia, which made landfall as
a Category 3 hurricane.</p>
<p>“I am used to storms and I’m used to cleaning up after storms,” Horne
said.</p>
<p>Debby was expected to move eastward over northern Florida and then
stall over the coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina, thrashing
the region with potential record-setting rains totaling up to 76
centimeter) beginning Tuesday. Officials also warned of life-threatening
storm surge along Florida’s Gulf Coast, with 1.8 to 3 meters of
inundation expected Monday between the Ochlockonee and Suwannee
rivers.</p>
<p>“There’s some really amazing rainfall totals being forecast and
amazing in a bad way,” Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane
center, said at a briefing. “That would be record-breaking rainfall
associated with a tropical cyclone for both the states of Georgia and
South Carolina if we got up to the 30-inch level.”</p>
<p>Flooding impacts could last through Friday and are expected to be
especially severe in low-lying areas near the coast, including Savannah,
Georgia; Hilton Head, South Carolina; and Charleston, South Carolina.
North Carolina officials were monitoring the storm’s progress.</p>
<p>Officials in Savannah said the area could see a month’s worth of rain
in four days if the system stalls over the region.</p>
<p>“This is going to a significant storm. The word historic cannot be
underscored here,” Savannah Mayor Van. R. Johnson said during a press
conference.</p>
<p>The hurricane center said at 11 p.m. that Debby was located about 161
kilometers west of Tampa, Florida, with maximum sustained winds of 120
kph. The storm was moving north at 19 kph.</p>
<p>Debby’s outer bands grazed the west coast of Florida, flooding
streets and bringing power outages. Sarasota County officials said most
roadways on Siesta Key, a barrier island off the coast of Sarasota, were
under water. The hurricane center had predicted the system would
strengthen as it curved off the southwest Florida coast, where the water
has been extremely warm.</p>
<p>At a briefing Sunday afternoon, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned the
storm could lead to “really, really significant flooding that will
happen in North Central Florida.”</p>
<p>The storm would follow a similar track to Hurricane Idalia but would
“be much wetter. We are going to see much more inundation,” he said.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning was issued for parts of the Big Bend and Florida
Panhandle areas, while tropical storm warnings were posted for Florida’s
West Coast, the southern Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. A tropical storm
watch extended farther west into the Panhandle.</p>
<p>Tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and
overwhelm drainage systems and canals. Forecasters warned of 15
centimeters to 30 centimeters of rain and up to 46 centimeters in
isolated areas of Florida.</p>
<p>Storm surge expected to hit Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay</p>
<p>Flat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days and the storm
was predicted to bring a surge of 0.6 to 1.2 meters along most of the
Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay, with a storm tide of up to 2.1 meters
north of there in the Big Bend region.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned of “a danger of life-threatening storm surge
inundation” in a region that includes Hernando Beach, Crystal River,
Steinhatchee and Cedar Key. Officials in Citrus and Levy counties
ordered a mandatory evacuation of coastal areas, while those in
Hernando, Manatee, Pasco and Taylor counties called for voluntary
evacuations. Shelters opened in those and some other counties.</p>
<p>Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast estimated 21,000 people live

<p>Residents, businesses prepare for flooding</p>
<p>Residents in Steinhatchee, Florida, which flooded during Hurricane
Idalia, spent Sunday moving items to higher ground.</p>
<p>“I’ve been here 29 years. This isn’t the first time I’ve done it. Do
you get used to it? No,” Mark Reblin said as he moved items out of the
liquor store he owns.</p>
<p>Employees of Savannah Canoe and Kayak in Georgia said they were busy
tying down their watercraft, laying sandbags, and raising equipment off
the ground. Mayme Bouy, the store manager, said she wasn’t too concerned
about the forecast calling for a potential historic rain event.</p>
<p>“But we do have some high tides this week so if the rain is happening
around then, that could be bad,” Bouy added. “I’d rather play it safe
than sorry.”</p>
<p>Governors declare emergencies ahead of landfall</p>
<p>DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s 67
counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members.
Utility crews from in and out of state were ready to restore power after
the storm, he said in a post on X. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and South
Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster made their own emergency declarations.</p>
<p>In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to
barricade against flooding.</p>
<p>“We’ve got our stormwater drains cleared out. We’ve got our
generators all checked and full. We’re doing everything that we need to
be prepared to face a tropical storm,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said.</p>
<p>Northeast coast also preparing for storm conditions</p>
<p>Emergency managers in New England and New York were already
monitoring the path of the storm for the possibility of remnants
striking their states. States including New York and Vermont have been
hit by heavy rain and thunderstorms in recent weeks and were still
coping with flooding and saturated ground.</p>

weather helps firefighters corral a third of big California blaze</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICO, California — Fire crews battling California’s largest wildfire
this year have corralled a third of the blaze aided in part by cooler
weather, but a return of triple-digit temperatures could allow it to
grow, fire officials said Sunday.</p>
<p>Cooler temperatures and increased humidity gave firefighters “a great
opportunity to make some good advances” on the fire in the Sierra Nevada
foothills, said Chris Vestal, a spokesman for the California Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p>
<p>The Park Fire has scorched 1,623 square kilometers since igniting
July 24 when authorities said a man pushed a burning car into a gully in
Chico and then fled. The blaze was 30% contained as of Sunday.</p>
<p>The massive fire has scorched an area bigger than the city of Los
Angeles, which covers about 1,302 square kilometers. It continues to
burn through rugged, inaccessible, and steep terrain with dense
vegetation.</p>
<p>The fire’s push northward has brought it toward the rugged lava rock
landscape surrounding Lassen Volcanic National Park, which has been
closed because of the threat. The inhospitable terrain remains one of
the biggest challenges for firefighters.</p>
<p>“The challenge with that is we can’t use our heavy machinery like
bulldozers to go through and cut a line right through it,” Vestal
said.</p>
<p>“On top of that, we have to put human beings, our hand crews, in to
remove those fuels and some of that terrain is not really the greatest
for people that are hiking so it takes a long time and extremely hard
work,” he added.</p>
<p>The fire has destroyed at least 572 structures and damaged 52 others.
At least 2,700 people in Butte and Tehama Counties remain under
evacuation orders, Veal said.</p>
<p>After days of smoky skies, clear skies Sunday allowed firefighters to
deploy helicopters and other aircraft to aid in the fight against the
blaze as temperatures reached above 38 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>“The fire is in a good place from the weather conditions we had the
last couple of days but we still have to worry about the weather that we
have and the conditions that are going to be present now for about the
next five or six days,” Veal said.</p>
<p>The fire in Northern California is one of 85 large blazes burning
across the West.</p>
<p>In Colorado, firefighters were making progress Sunday against three
major fires burning near heavily populated areas north and south of
Denver. Many residents evacuated by the fires have been allowed to go
back home.</p>
<p>The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office is investigating a blaze
threatening hundreds of homes near the Colorado city of Littleton as
arson.</p>
<p>About 50 structures were damaged or destroyed, about half of them
homes, by a fire near Loveland. And one person was found dead in a home
burned by a fire west of the town of Lyons.</p>
<p>Scientists say extreme wildfires are becoming more common and
destructive in the U.S. West and other parts of the world as climate
change warms the planet and droughts become more severe.</p>
<p>In Canada, a 24-year-old firefighter battling a blaze in Jasper
National Park was killed Saturday by a falling tree, the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police said.</p>
<p>The firefighter from Calgary, whose name was not released, was
battling a fire north of Jasper, a town in Alberta Province that was
half destroyed last month by a fast-moving fire.</p>

id="us-expected-to-propose-barring-chinese-software-in-autonomous-vehicles">US
expected to propose barring Chinese software in autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to propose
barring Chinese software in autonomous and connected vehicles in the
coming weeks, according to sources briefed on the matter.</p>
<p>The Biden administration plans to issue a proposed rule that would
bar Chinese software in vehicles in the United States with Level 3
automation and above, which would have the effect of also banning
testing on U.S. roads of autonomous vehicles produced by Chinese
companies.</p>
<p>The administration, in a previously unreported decision, also plans
to propose barring vehicles with Chinese-developed advanced wireless
communications abilities modules from U.S. roads, the sources added.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, automakers and suppliers would need to verify
that none of their connected vehicle or advanced autonomous vehicle
software was developed in a “foreign entity of concern” like China, the
sources said.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said last month it planned to issue proposed
rules on connected vehicles in August and expected to impose limits on
some software made in China and other countries deemed adversaries.</p>
<p>Asked for comment, a Commerce Department spokesperson said on Sunday
that the department “is concerned about the national security risks
associated with connected technologies in connected vehicles.”</p>
<p>The department’s Bureau of Industry and Security will issue a
proposed rule that “will focus on specific systems of concern within the
vehicle. Industry will also have a chance to review that proposed rule
and submit comments.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment but the
Chinese foreign ministry has previously urged the United States “to
respect the laws of the market economy and principles of fair
competition.” It argues Chinese cars are popular globally because they
had emerged out of fierce market competition and are technologically
innovative.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the White House and State Department hosted a meeting
with allies and industry leaders to “jointly address the national
security risks associated with connected vehicles,” the department said.
Sources said officials disclosed details of the administration’s planned
rule.</p>
<p>The meeting included officials from the United States, Australia,
Canada, the European Union, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom who “exchanged views on the data
and cybersecurity risks associated with connected vehicles and certain
components.”</p>
<p>Also known as conditional driving automation, Level 3 involves
technology that allows drivers to engage in activities behind the wheel,
such as watching movies or using smartphones, but only under some
limited conditions.</p>
<p>In November, a group of U.S. lawmakers raised alarm about Chinese
companies collecting and handling sensitive data while testing
autonomous vehicles in the United States and asked questions of 10 major
companies including Baidu, Nio, WeRide, Didi Chuxing, Xpeng, Inceptio,
Pony.ai, AutoX, Deeproute.ai and Qcraft.</p>
<p>The letters said in the 12 months ended November 2022 that Chinese AV
companies test drove more than 450,000 miles in California. In July
2023, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said his department had
national security concerns about Chinese autonomous vehicle companies in
the United States.</p>
<p>The administration is worried about connected vehicles using the
driver monitoring system to listen or record occupants or take control
of the vehicle itself.</p>
<p>“The national security risks are quite significant,” Commerce
Secretary Gina Raimondo said in May. “We decided to take action because
this is really serious stuff.”</p>

‘whacked’ by too many laws, regulations, says Justice Gorsuch’s
book</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Ordinary Americans are “getting whacked” by too many
laws and regulations, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch says in a new
book that underscores his skepticism of federal agencies and the power
they wield.</p>
<p>“Too little law and we’re not safe, and our liberties aren’t
protected,” Gorsuch told The Associated Press in an interview in his
Supreme Court office. “But too much law and you actually impair those
same things.”</p>
<p>“Over Ruled: The Human Toll of Too Much Law” is being published
Tuesday by Harper, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. Gorsuch has
received a $500,000 advance for the book, according to his annual
financial disclosure reports.</p>
<p>In the interview, Gorsuch refused to be drawn into discussions about
term limits or an enforceable code of ethics for the justices, both
recently proposed by President Joe Biden at a time of diminished public
trust in the court. Justice Elena Kagan, speaking a couple of days
before Biden, separately said the court’s ethics code, adopted by the
justices last November, should have a means of enforcement.</p>
<p>But Gorsuch did talk about the importance of judicial independence.
“I’m not saying that there aren’t ways to improve what we have. I’m
simply saying that we’ve been given something very special. It’s the
envy of the world, the United States judiciary,” he said.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old justice was the first of three Supreme Court nominees
of then-President Donald Trump, and they have combined to entrench a
conservative majority that has overturned Roe v. Wade, ended affirmative
action in college admissions, expanded gun rights and clipped
environmental regulations aimed at climate change, as well as air and
water pollution more generally.</p>
<p>A month ago, the Supreme Court completed a term in which Gorsuch and
the court’s five other conservative justices delivered sharp rebukes to
the administrative state in three major cases, including the decision
that overturned the 40-year-old Chevron decision that had made it more
likely that courts would sustain regulations. The court’s three liberal
justices dissented each time.</p>
<p>Gorsuch also was in the majority in ruling that former presidents
have broad immunity from criminal prosecution in a decision that
indefinitely delayed the election interference case against Trump.
What’s more, the justices made it harder to use a federal obstruction
charge against people who were part of the mob that violently attacked
the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn Trump’s defeat by Biden in the
2020 election.</p>
<p>Gorsuch defended the immunity ruling as necessary to prevent
presidents from being hampered while in office by threats of prosecution
once they leave.</p>
<p>The court had to wrestle with an unprecedented situation, he said.
“Here we have, for the first time in our history, one presidential
administration bringing criminal charges against a prior president. It’s
a grave question, right? Grave implications,” Gorsuch said.</p>
<p>But in the book, co-authored by a former law clerk, Janie Nitze,
Gorsuch largely sets those big issues aside and turns his focus to a
fisherman, a magician, Amish farmers, immigrants, a hair braider and
others who risked jail time, large fines, deportation and other
hardships over unyielding rules.</p>
<p>In 18 years as a judge, including the past seven on the Supreme
Court, Gorsuch said, “There were just so many cases that came to me in
which I saw ordinary Americans, just everyday, regular people trying to
go about their lives, not trying to hurt anybody or do anything wrong
and just getting whacked, unexpectedly, by some legal rule they didn’t
know about.”</p>
<p>The problem, he said, is that there has been an explosion of laws and
regulations, at both the federal and state levels. The sheer volume of
Congress’ output for the past decade is overwhelming, he said, averaging
344 pieces of legislation totaling 2 million to 3 million words a
year.</p>
<p>One vignette involves John Yates, a Florida fisherman who was
convicted of getting rid of some undersized grouper under a federal law
originally aimed at the accounting industry and the destruction of
evidence in the Enron scandal. Yates’ case went all the way to the
Supreme Court, where he won by a single vote.</p>
<p>“I wanted to tell the story of people whose lives were affected,”
Gorsuch said.</p>
<p>The book expands on a theme that has run through Gorsuch’s opinions
over the years, from his criticism of the Chevron decision back when he
served on a federal appeals court in Denver to his statement in May 2023
in which he called emergency measures taken during the COVID-19 crisis
that killed more than 1 million Americans perhaps “the greatest
intrusions on civil liberties in the peacetime history of this
country.”</p>
<p>While Gorsuch has voted with the other conservative justices in most
of the court’s momentous cases, he also has joined with the liberals in
notable cases, including those in which he wrote the opinion in 2020
that expanded protections against workplace discrimination to LGBTQ
people. Gorsuch also has sided with the liberal justices in all the
court’s cases involving Native Americans since he joined the court.</p>
<p>Immigration, especially when people fighting deportation have
complained they were given inadequate notice about hearings, is another
area where he has typically broken with his conservative colleagues.</p>
<p>Gorsuch recently returned from a summer teaching gig in Porto,
Portugal, for the George Mason University law school. Last year, he
spent two weeks in Lisbon, Portugal, with the same program for which he
was paid nearly $30,000, plus meals, lodging and travel.</p>
<p>He will travel to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi
Valley, California, later this week to talk about the new book.</p>
<p>The day he met with AP, he said, was the first time in weeks that he
put on a tie. He wore a dark blue suit, cowboy boots and a Western-style
belt.</p>
<p>He seemed at ease, offering chocolate chip cookies and coffee to
visitors and joking with a reporter who talked about an upcoming trip to
the New Jersey shore. “Go fly some flags up there,” Gorsuch said, a
reference to the controversy over flags, similar to those carried by
Jan. 6 rioters, that were flown at homes owned by Justice Samuel Alito
and his wife.</p>
<p>Gorsuch is not the only justice rolling out a book this summer.
Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s memoir, “Lovely One,” will be published
next month.</p>

Harris Can Be the Pro-Innovation President Silicon Valley Needs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
[<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/opinion/kamala-harris-innovation-technology.html">Reid
Hoffman in the New York Times</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“As Vice President Harris defines her vision for how best to lead the
United States in this moment in time, she has an opportunity to take the
torch passed to her by President Biden in an explicitly pro-innovation
direction. Instead of governing by tweet, Mr. Biden passed bipartisan
legislation like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act that authorized hundreds of billions of dollars
for new manufacturing construction and investment.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman explains why Silicon Valley should get
behind Harris, counter to the example set by Musk, Andreessen, and a few
others. Hoffman is a co-signatory of VCs for Kamala, which makes clear
that most Silicon Valley funders are in favor of the Democratic
candidate and current Vice President.
</p>
<p>
Hoffman make the case clearly:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Under the Biden-Harris administration, U.S. stock market indexes hit
all-time highs, with the S&amp;P 500 increasing by 48 percent.
Unemployment dropped below 4 percent. The number of U.S. manufacturing
jobs hit its highest level since 2008. While Mr. Trump’s great ambition
was to build a big beautiful border wall, Mr. Biden actually secured the
necessary funding to build large-scale factories for manufacturing
semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, solar cells and more. And
we’re now constructing them at stunning rates.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m more pro-regulation than Hoffman is. Harris should maintain a strong
antitrust stance, too, I believe, as well as providing new protections
against the worst excesses of AI and other technologies that might harm
vulnerable groups. But it’s certainly true that her administration will
be better for innovation than her opponent, even if the latter might be
better for lining the pockets of a few select billionaires.
</p>
<p>
This is also true:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“In a speech Ms. Harris gave on the future of A.I. in 2023, she noted
that we must “reject the false choice that suggests we can either
protect the public or advance innovation.”“
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is a false choice. Regulation, principles, and a duty of care to the
public are not anti-innovation: in fact, they promote it. And that’s the
direction we should all be heading in.

<h2 id="chrome-warns-ublock-origin-may-soon-be-disabled">Chrome warns
uBlock Origin may soon be disabled</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>As uBlock Origin lead developer and maintainer Raymond Hill explained
on Friday, this is the result of Google deprecating support for the
Manifest v2 (MV2) extensions platform in favor of Manifest v3 (MV3).
“uBO is a Manifest v2 extension, hence the warning in your Google Chrome
browser. There is no Manifest v3 version of uBO, hence the browser will
suggest alternative extensions as a replacement for uBO,” Hill
explained. ↫ Sergiu Gatlan at Bleeping Computer If you’re still using
Chrome, or any possible Chrome skins who have not committed to keeping
Manifest v2 extensions enabled, it’s really high time to start thinking
about jumping ship if ad blocking matters to you. Of course, we don’t
know for how long Firefox will remain able to properly block ads either,
but for now, it’s obviously the better choice for those of us who care
about a better browsing experience. And just to reiterate: I fully
support anyone’s right to block ads, even on OSNews. Your computer, your
rules. There are a variety of other, better means to support OSNews –
our Patreon, individual donations through Ko-Fi, or buying our merch –
that are far better for us than ads will ever be.</p>

<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
Somehow, I need to deal with my sadness.
</p>
<p>
Do we all?
</p>
<p>
It’s like it sits just under the surface, ready to spring up. Is every
adult like this? I think it must be more common than anyone talks about.
It’s not even that the world is getting harder, between climate change
and nationalism and war; it’s the narrowing vice of what it takes to
just be alive. There’s no time, there’s no money, we’re all expected to
be a part of a template that someone else has established for their own
benefit. It’s maybe easier if you’re rich, because more money roughly
translates to more time and more freedom, at least in America, but even
the rich get trapped into their own cycles of spending and acquiescence
in order to maintain their lifestyles. Even rich kids compare their
lives to people who have it better. They’ve got to keep earning,
somehow.
</p>
<p>
I had a conversation with a good friend recently. I told her that I felt
like I was living in a branch in the timestream, and I was waiting for
the world to snap back to the main timeline.
</p>
<p>
“Ben,” she patiently told me, “this <em>is</em> the main timeline.”
</p>
<p>
I mean, fuck.
</p>
<p>
I’m older than I think I am. That’s a common problem too, I think:
finding yourself stuck in that late twenties / early thirties mindset
where you’re still exploring and nothing is really set in stone yet. I’m
forty-five. My next major milestone birthday is <em>fifty</em>. I’m
fifteen years away from being sixty years old. Is it always going to
feel like this? When, exactly, will I have my shit together?
</p>
<p>
I’m still dealing with the loss of my mother and everything that led up
to it. It’s been thirteen years since I moved to America to be closer to
her, because she needed supplementary oxygen and it wasn’t clear how
long she would live for. For so much of that time, I was worried about
her. The two fridge-sized oxygen concentrators running in parallel so
she would have enough to breathe, the clear tubes snaking around the
house as she moved; the day she had her double lung transplant, when the
ICU nurses eventually had to kick me out of her room; her first steps,
set perfectly to Beyoncé’s Super Bowl half-time show; the joy of being
free; the slow sadness of the drugs taking it all away from her. The
nightmare trauma of palliative care and my guilt for not having done
more. Wishing I’d said more to her in those final hours. Wishing I’d
talked more with her overall. Feeling, despite everything I know, that I
must have disappointed her, she must be mad at me, because she’s never
shown up in a dream for me since.
</p>
<p>
My life hasn’t been real. It’s all a hyper-surreal collection of scenes
that I’ve been disassociated from to varying degrees. After her loss, I
fell into a trough of feeling like nothing at all mattered, like I was
disconnected from the cause and effect of reality. It was all a dream.
</p>
<p>
It was not a dream. This <em>is</em> the main timeline.
</p>
<p>
One of the things about being a third culture kid — or maybe this isn’t
about being a third culture kid at all, maybe it’s just about me, or
maybe everyone feels this — is that however you may superficially appear
to be a part of an archetype, you’re <em>not</em> a part of it. For all
those years with a British accent, going to an English school, I was
missing the cultural touchpoints and feeling of <em>belonging</em>. Some
people are anchored in place, nationhood, nationality, their hometowns.
The only feeling of belonging that really made sense to me was family:
the only people who had that same background, that mix of cultural
touchpoints and recognition. Losing family is about the profound hole
that’s left when someone you love is suddenly gone, a real hurt, but
it’s also about losing a tether: losing belonging itself.
</p>
<p>
I have always felt like I don’t really matter to anyone, except to my
family. I could disappear tomorrow and, shrug. When I was younger, I
convinced myself that there was some kind of magic incantation that
other people knew and I didn’t; if I could just learn the password, I’d
be a part of what everyone else was a part of. Until then, I wasn’t good
enough. I needed to prove myself.
</p>
<p>
When I didn’t date in high school, it was because I wasn’t good enough.
(All those beautiful people who did — I admired them so much. To my
teenage eyes, to hook up with someone meant that they
<em>accepted</em>you. What an unattainable thing for someone who didn’t
feel like he belonged.) (And: Christ, why was my body so <em>big</em>. I
hated my physicality. I wanted so badly for someone to tell me I was
okay. This is still true.) Every job I didn’t get, I wasn’t good enough.
When my startups didn’t hit the highs I was hoping for, I wasn’t good
enough. Every mistake, I wasn’t good enough. I didn’t measure up.
</p>
<p>
I don’t measure up. I’m not good enough. Even in my chosen profession,
I’ve never been in the cool developer circle, I’ve never quite made it
into the in crowd. I am still scared of my body, of catching myself in
the mirror. I’m still looking for the password.
</p>
<p>
This backchannel in my head is exhausting. It’s another reason to think:
eh, I don’t matter, nothing I do is really that important.
</p>
<p>
The thing about being convinced that you’re in some kind of dream-world
fork of reality is that you don’t face these things. The temptation is
to slide and slide — nothing really matters, remember? — and pretend
that one day you’ll go back to how it was before any of it started. But
you have to; there is no going back; if this <em>is</em> a fork, it’s
been worked on so long that there’s no way you could possibly rebase to
the main branch. This is life.
</p>
<p>
Which brings me to: I have a son.
</p>
<p>
He’s beautiful and smart; his smile cuts through everything else. He
sings the alphabet song in the back seat of the car and randomly walks
up to me and says “hug” before wrapping me in an embrace. I wish my
mother could have met him, is the toxic thought, but he is infused with
everything that was good about her. To him, I want to be the belonging
she represented to me. The belonging that my dad still represents for
me. (Largely unacknowledged: I am terrified of losing him, too.)
</p>
<p>
That means I have to deal with this sadness, this untethered unreality.
This has to be the main branch, because no other branch has him in it.
What I do matters to him, a lot, and it will for the rest of his life.
</p>
<p>
Therapy? Yes, of course. Parts Work and reflection and perspective. I
have a trauma therapist and Erin and I have a couples therapist and
these things work.
</p>
<p>
But they don’t cut to the sadness. The sadness is there, always. And I
have to deal with it, don’t I, because eventually it will infuse itself
into my son. I don’t want him to carry it. I want him to be free of its
tendrils. I want him to not feel how I feel.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been focused on the loss of belonging, and the idea of returning to
a less complicated timeline. I think, though, the way to deal with the
sadness is simpler, although also harder.
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, finally, I’ve got to make peace with myself.
</p>
<p>
That’s the job.
</p>
<p>
I’ll be honest: I don’t have the first clue how to do it.
</p>
<p>
And I don’t know how universal this is. Is this something that’s unique
to me? Something that a lot of people quietly deal with? Is this sadness
sitting just underneath everybody’s skin, or is it just an infection
under mine? If it <em>is</em> lurking everywhere, shallowly digging its
way into everyone, what can we do about it? How can we tell each other
that we belong, that we’re okay, that it’s alright?
</p>
<p>
And if it’s not: please, finally, what’s the password? Not for my sake.
For his.

<h2
id="wall-street-week-ahead-flaring-economic-worries-threaten-us-stocks-rally">Wall
Street week ahead: Flaring economic worries threaten US stocks
rally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Economic fears are roiling Wall Street, as worries grow
that the Federal Reserve may have left interest rates elevated for too
long, allowing them to hurt U.S. growth.</p>
<p>Alarming economic data in recent days have deepened those concerns.
U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July, a Friday report
showed, while the unemployment rate increased to 4.3%, heightening fears
that a deteriorating labor market could make the economy vulnerable to a
recession.</p>
<p>The jobs report exacerbated a selloff in stocks that began on
Thursday, when data showing weakness in the labor market and
manufacturing sector pushed investors to dump everything from chip
stocks to industrials while piling into defensive plays.</p>
<p>Richly valued tech stocks tumbled further on Friday, extending losses
in the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC to more than 10% from a record closing
high reached in July. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index .SPX has slid 5.7%
from its July peak.</p>
<p>“This is what a growth scare looks like,” said Wasif Latif, president
and chief investment officer at Sarmaya Partners. “The market is now
realizing that the economy is indeed slowing.”</p>
<p>For months, investors had been heartened by cooling inflation and
gradually slowing employment, believing they bolstered the case for the
Fed to begin cutting interest rates. That optimism drove big gains in
stocks: the S&amp;P 500 remains up 12% this year, despite recent losses;
the Nasdaq has gained nearly 12%.</p>
<p>Now that a September rate cut has come into view following a Fed
meeting this week, investors are fretting that elevated borrowing costs
may already be hurting economic growth. Corporate earnings results,
which saw disappointments from companies such as Amazon, Alphabet and
Intel, are adding to their concerns.</p>
<p>“We’re witnessing the fallout from the curse of high expectations,”
said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset
Management. “So much had been invested around the scenario of a soft
landing, that anything that even suggests something different is
difficult.”</p>
<p>Next week brings earnings from industrial bellwether Caterpillar
CAT.N and media and entertainment giant Walt Disney DIS.N, which will
give more insight into the health of the consumer and manufacturing, as
well as reports from healthcare heavyweights such as weight-loss
drugmaker Eli Lilly LLY.N.</p>
<p>Bets in the futures markets on Friday suggested growing unease about
the economy. Fed fund futures reflected traders pricing an over-70%
chance of a 50-basis point cut at the central bank’s September meeting,
compared to 22% the day before, according to CME FedWatch. Futures
priced a total of 116 basis points in rate cuts in 2024, compared to
just over 60 basis points priced in on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Broader markets also showed signs of unease. The Cboe Volatility
index .VIX - known as Wall Street’s fear gauge - hit its highest since
March 2023 on Friday as demand for options protection against a stock
market selloff rose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, investors have rushed into safe haven bonds and other
defensive areas of the market. U.S. 10-year yields - which move
inversely to bond prices - on Friday dropped as low as 3.79%, the lowest
since December.</p>
<p>Sectors that are often popular during times of economic uncertainty
are also drawing investors.</p>
<p>Options data for the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV.P showed
the average daily balance between put and call contracts over the last
month at its most bullish in about three years, according to a Reuters
analysis of Trade Alert data. Trading in the options on Utilities Select
Sector SPDR Fund XLU.P also shows a pullback in defensive positioning,
highlighting traders’ expectations for strength for the sector.</p>
<p>The healthcare sector .SPXHC is up 4% in the past month, while
utilities .SPLRCU are up over 9%. By contrast, the Philadelphia SE
Semiconductor index .SOX is down nearly 17% in that period amid sharp
losses in investor favorites such as Nvidia NVDA.O and Broadcom
AVGO.O.</p>
<p>To be sure, some investors said the data could just be a reason to
lock in profits after the market’s overall strong run in 2024.</p>
<p>“This is a good excuse for investors to sell after a huge year to
date rally,” said Michael Purves, CEO of Tallbacken Capital Advisors.
“Investors should be prepared for some major volatility, particularly in
the big tech stocks. But it will probably be short-lived.”</p>

<p>Limine is an advanced, portable, multiprotocol bootloader that
supports Linux, multiboot1 and 2, the native Limine boot protocol, and
more. Limine is lightweight, elegant, fast, and the reference
implementation of the Limine boot protocol. The Limine boot protocol’s
main target audience is operating system and kernel developers that want
to use a boot protocol which supports modern features in an elegant
manner, that GRUB’s aging multiboot protocols do not (or do not
properly). ↫ Limine website I wish trying out different bootloaders was
an easier thing to do. Personally, since my systems only run Fedora
Linux, I’d love to just move them all over to systemd-boot and not deal
with GRUB at all anymore, but since it’s not supported by Fedora I’m
worried updates might break the boot process at some point. On systems
where only one operating system is installed, as a user I should really
be given the choice to opt for the simplest, most basic boot sequence,
even if it can’t boot any other operating systems or if it’s more
limited than GRUB.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-o3-optimization-for-ubuntu">Exploring O3 optimization
for Ubuntu</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Following our recent work 5 with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS where we enabled
frame pointers by default to improve debugging and profiling, we’re
continuing our performance engineering efforts by evaluating the impact
of O3 optimization in Ubuntu. O3 is a GCC optimization 14 level that
applies more aggressive code transformations compared to the default O2
level. These include advanced function and the use of sophisticated
algorithms aimed at enhancing execution speed. While O3 can increase
binary size and compilation time, it has the potential to improve
runtime performance. ↫ Ubuntu Discourse If these optimisations deliver
performance improvements, and the only downside is larger binaries and
longer compilation times, it seems like a bit of a no-brainer to enable
these, assuming those mentioned downsides are within reason. Are there
any downsides they’re not mentioning? Browsing around and doing some
minor research it seems that -O3 optimisations may break some packages,
and can even lead to performance degradation, defeating the purpose
altogether. Looking at a set of benchmarks from Phoronix from a few
years ago, in which the Linux kernel was compiled with either O2 and O3
and their performance compared, the results were effectively tied,
making it seem not worth it at all. However, during these benchmarks,
only the kernel was tested; everything else was compiled normally in
both cases. Perhaps compiling the entire system with O3 will yield
improvements in other parts of the system that do add up. For now, you
can download unsupported Ubuntu ISOs compiled with O3 optimisations
enabled to test them out.</p>

id="in-win-for-mexico-us-will-expand-areas-for-migrants-to-apply-online-for-entry-at-southern-border">In
win for Mexico, US will expand areas for migrants to apply online for
entry at southern border</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Mexico City — The Biden administration will expand areas where
migrants can apply online for appointments to enter the United States to
a large swath of southern Mexico, officials said Saturday, potentially
easing strains on the Mexican government and lessening dangers for
people trying to reach the U.S. border to claim asylum.</p>
<p>Migrants will be able to schedule appointments on the CBP One app
from the states of Chiapas and Tabasco, extending the zone from northern
and central Mexico, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said. The move
satisfies a request of Mexico, an increasingly close partner of the U.S.
in efforts to control extraordinary migration flows.</p>
<p>The change will spare migrants from traveling north through Mexico to
get one of 1,450 appointments made available daily, CBP said. The agency
said it will happen soon but did not give a date.</p>
<p>“We consistently engage with our partners in the Government of Mexico
and work together to adjust policies and practices in response to the
latest migration trends and security needs,” CBP said in a
statement.</p>
<p>The statement confirmed remarks a day earlier by Mexico’s Foreign
Affairs Secretary Alicia Bárcena, who said closer relations with the
United States cut migration sharply from late last year.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said increased Mexican enforcement is largely
responsible for a sharp drop in U.S. arrests for illegal border
crossings during the first half of this year. Mexican officials have
stepped up their presence at highway checkpoints and on railroads
leading to the U.S. border, returning most to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>In June, the U.S. temporarily suspended asylum processing for those
who enter the country illegally, making CBP One of the only avenues for
migrants to enter the U.S. to seek asylum and further driving down
illegal entries. U.S. officials said arrests for illegal crossings
plunged 30% in July from the previous month to the lowest level of Joe
Biden’s presidency and the lowest since September 2020.</p>
<p>“We have managed to decompress our [northern] border in a very
meaningful way and that has helped … our relationship with the United
States be very, very dynamic and very positive,” Bárcena said
Friday.</p>
<p>More than 680,000 people scheduled CBP One appointments at eight
Mexican land crossings with the U.S. from its introduction in January
2023 through June. The top nationalities are Venezuelan, Cuban and
Haitian. U.S. authorities recently limited slots for Mexicans due to the
high number of applicants from the country.</p>
<p>The perils of traveling through Mexico to be kidnapped or robbed has
prompted many migrants to fly to northern border cities like Tijuana for
their CBP One appointments once they reach the southernmost point from
which they can apply — until now, Mexico City.</p>
<p>Migrants generally enter Mexico in Chiapas or Tabasco from Guatemala.
Mexico City may offer more job opportunities and relative safety but the
cost of living is higher, prompting some to live in informal camps in
the nation’s capital.</p>

going to survive and it’s going to come back’: A year after Maui
wildfire, survivors press on</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAHAINA, Hawaii — They have combed the ashes for mementos, worried
about where they would sleep, questioned their faith and tried to find a
way to grieve amid the great, unsettling devastation. Residents have
faced a year of challenges, practical and emotional, since the deadliest
U.S. wildfire in a century decimated the historic town of Lahaina, on
Maui, on Aug. 8, 2023.</p>
<p>To mark the anniversary, The Associated Press interviewed seven
survivors its journalists first encountered in the days, weeks or months
after the fire, as well as a first responder who helped fight the
flames. Among their difficulties, they also have found hope, resilience
and determination: the Vietnam veteran who has helped others deal with
post-traumatic stress; the Buddhist minister with a new appreciation for
the sunsets from Lahaina; the college-bound teen aspiring to become a
Maui firefighter himself.</p>
<p>Here is a series of vignettes examining some of their experiences
over the past year.</p>
<p>Coping and staying</p>
<p>Even as he hid behind a seawall from the flames, Thomas Leonard knew
Lahaina’s wildfire was going to give him flashbacks to his service as a
U.S. Marine in Vietnam 55 years ago. The exploding cars and propane
tanks sounded just like mortars.</p>
<p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom — one car after another,” he said.</p>
<p>The nightmares started a few months later. His Veterans
Administration doctor prescribed new sleeping medication.</p>
<p>“Thank God for the VA,” he said.</p>
<p>The 75-year-old retired mailman learned to identify signs of
post-traumatic stress disorder at a VA clinic in 2001, helping him spot
and cope with new triggers. He’s also helped fellow fire survivors.</p>
<p>“I’ve learned to be a really good listener on that with other people,
what they’re going through,” he said.</p>
<p>His condo building is still a pile of ash and rubble. Leonard
suspects it might take years to rebuild, but he’s determined to see it
through. He’s been living in hotels and a rented condo.</p>
<p>“We all got to stay together here on Maui,” Leonard said. “We’re
going to survive and it’s going to come back.”</p>
<p>Memories of gold</p>
<p>After Elsie Rosales arrived on Maui from the Philippines in 1999, she
scrimped on a hotel housekeeper’s salary. As she saved up enough to buy
a five-bedroom house in Lahaina in 2014, she did allow herself a few
luxuries: gold bracelets, delicate hoop earrings, things she could never
have afforded if she remained in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Like the home — her pride, her American dream — the jewelry was a
reminder of what’s possible in the U.S.</p>
<p>It all was wiped out in the wildfire that destroyed Lahaina. When she
finally was allowed back on the property, she dug through the debris for
anything that survived. All she found was a broken bangle.</p>
<p>She used insurance money to pay off the mortgage on the house. She’s
now renting a two-bedroom apartment with her husband, their son and
their son’s girlfriend in Kahului, an hourlong bus ride from
Lahaina.</p>
<p>On those long commutes, she reflects on how she amassed her jewelry
collection, only for it to vanish.</p>
<p>“When I’m not working, I keep thinking about everything that burned,”
she said. “Especially my jewelry. Everything that I worked hard
for.”</p>
<p>Missing the mana</p>
<p>Surfing off his Lahaina home always gave Ekolu Lindsey “mana,”
spiritual energy. The house was in his family for five generations.</p>
<p>He’s so familiar with the area he notices when more crabs are around
or fish are undersized. He has brought school groups there to teach them
about the coral, seaweed and the ocean.</p>
<p>“My reset button is to jump in the water at home,” he said.</p>
<p>That has been impossible since the wildfire turned his house to
rubble. His property is now clear of debris but has no electricity or
other utilities. Reconstruction is well off.</p>
<p>He’s living at a friend’s place on Oahu, another island, a plane ride
away. He couldn’t find anything in Lahaina for less than $4,000 a
month.</p>
<p>He returns regularly to Maui to help restore native forests, a focus
of the nonprofit his father founded, Maui Cultural Lands. Sadness weighs
on him as he drives the winding coastal highway to Lahaina.</p>
<p>State conservation officials won’t allow people to enter the ocean
from the burn zone. He surfs on Oahu, but it’s not the same.</p>
<p>“You get the physical exercise,” he said, but not the “rejuvenation
of that mana.”</p>
<p>The right track</p>
<p>As he was dying of colon cancer, Mike Vierra spent sleepless nights
fretting about where his wife, Leola, and their daughter would live when
he was gone. The wildfire had reduced their home of more than half a
century to hardened pools of melted metal, burned wood and broken
glass.</p>
<p>By the time he passed away in April, the answer still wasn’t
clear.</p>
<p>Leola Vierra and her daughter moved multiple times after the fire,
switching hotel rooms and vacation rentals whenever the unit’s owners
would return.</p>
<p>“Everything was so unsettled,” she said.</p>
<p>The Vierras, married 57 years, also couldn’t find their beloved cat,
Kitty Kai. But in February, they learned Kitty Kai had found her way to
Kahului, 30 miles (48 kilometers) across the West Maui Mountains.</p>
<p>The reunion, while joyful, complicated their housing search.
Landlords are less likely to rent to families with pets.</p>
<p>Not until last month did Vierra find some stability, securing a
six-month lease while they wait to someday rebuild on their own
property. Their new place has a yard, a sundeck and an ocean view.</p>
<p>“I have been so depressed ever since my husband passed, and I can
feel my mind and my memory all going downhill,” she said. “With this new
home, I think I will be able to accept more things now, because it seems
like I’m on the right track.”</p>
<p>Cherishing sunsets</p>
<p>As the flames approached, Ai Hironaka and his family — wife, four
children, French bulldog — crammed into his Honda Civic and drove off,
leaving behind their home and the Japanese Buddhist temple where he was
resident minister and caretaker.</p>
<p>Losing those buildings and being uprooted amid the greater
devastation has tested him as a Buddhist. How should he behave as a
disaster victim? What is the appropriate response when someone gives him
donated clothing he doesn’t want? If he feels ungrateful, he turns to
the teachings of his religion.</p>
<p>“We all have an evil nature, self-centeredness,” he said.</p>
<p>After moving three times in the months after the fire, he now lives
across the island, nearly an hour away, at another temple, Kahului
Hongwanji Mission, where he also serves as resident minister. He
performs much of the same work he did at the Hongwanji Mission in
Lahaina: leading ceremonies and counseling members, including fire
survivors.</p>
<p>He returns to the site of the Lahaina temple occasionally to check
the columbarium, an area for storing funeral urns, which survived. He
misses the town, the beach parks, the parents on his son’s high school
football team.</p>
<p>And he misses the sunsets from Lahainaluna High School, overlooking
the ocean. When he goes back now, he does not take that view for
granted.</p>
<p>“I have to capture that,” he said, “because I cannot see this
tomorrow.”</p>
<p>From football to firefighting</p>
<p>Before the fire, Morgan “Bula” Montgomery was a kid who loved playing
football and paddling in the ocean. College wasn’t on his radar.</p>
<p>But the University of Hawaii offered full-ride scholarships for
Lahainaluna High School graduates at any school in its system following
the disaster. Montgomery thought, “Why not?”</p>
<p>He plans to leave Maui this fall to study fire science at Hawaii
Community College on the Big Island, inspired by the devastation and the
firefighters who tried to save the community.</p>
<p>“I want to come back to Lahaina and come back to Maui and try to be a
firefighter,” he said.</p>
<p>Montgomery’s family lost their two-bedroom apartment to the fire, but
also found opportunity. Montgomery and fellow Lahainaluna football
captains were invited to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas this year. It was
one of just a handful of times he has left Maui.</p>
<p>After spending time in a hotel, the family secured a rental house
about an hour drive across the island. It’s not convenient for his canoe
paddling practices in Lahaina. But it’s the biggest house they’ve lived
in, with five bedrooms, enough for his mom and her five children.</p>
<p>He’s a little nervous about leaving Maui but grateful for the
scholarship.</p>
<p>“An opportunity for school or free tuition is something you’ve got to
take advantage of,” Montgomery said.</p>
<p>‘That’s what we do’</p>
<p>Ikaika Blackburn, an 18-year veteran of the Maui Fire Department,
talks often with his crewmates about the blaze that consumed Lahaina: at
the fire house kitchen table, over cups of coffee while waiting for
calls or during family gatherings on days off.</p>
<p>His five-person crew was one of the first on the scene. There was no
time to think, “no time to have these sentimental feelings,” as he
fought through the night. He spent a lot of time growing up with his
grandparents in Lahaina. His wife is from the town. His mother-in-law
lost her home.</p>
<p>At daybreak, it set in: “We lost Lahaina.”</p>
<p>Blackburn and his crew spent days talking about it, “just releasing
it and not holding it all in,” he said. Recalling how they rushed from
one part of town to the next, trying to find a way to stop it.</p>
<p>“For the most part, we’re able to always win,” he said. “We’re always
able to get ahead of it.”</p>
<p>But this fire was different, uncontrollable. Firefighters and
investigators from outside Maui helped him understand that his crew did
all they could.</p>
<p>Blackburn followed his father’s footsteps as a Maui fire captain.
Firefighting feels like something he was born to do.</p>
<p>And he has kept doing it. This year’s busy brushfire season hasn’t
triggered memories of last August, he said, because nothing compares to
that fire.</p>
<p>“We respond to fires all the time,” he said. “That’s what we do.”</p>
<p>Lahaina Strong</p>
<p>When wildfire struck, Jordan Ruidas couldn’t sleep. Eager to help
families in the 21 homes that burned, she started a Facebook fundraiser
titled, “Lahaina Strong,” which raised more than $150,000.</p>
<p>That was in 2018.</p>
<p>Five years later, Ruidas and Lahaina Strong again emerged as leaders,
pushing officials to control tourism and try to find enough housing for
local residents after the 2023 fire destroyed thousands of
buildings.</p>
<p>Ruidas was seven months pregnant when last year’s fire destroyed
Lahaina. She sometimes missed prenatal checkups. Traveling nurses at
community hubs for fire survivors would check her blood pressure.</p>
<p>The fire spared her neighborhood and two months later she gave birth
at home to a daughter, Aulia.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I’ve dealt with all the emotions that came with losing
Lahaina and being postpartum,” she said. “I feel like I cope by staying
busy with work, with Lahaina Strong.”</p>
<p>Ruidas brought the baby along, strapped to her chest, when she helped
organize a “fish-in” protest at a popular beach resort demanding more
short-term rental housing be made available for survivors.</p>
<p>She still hasn’t been able to bring herself to visit the burn
zone.</p>
<p>“My kids will never grow up seeing or knowing the Lahaina that I grew
up seeing and knowing,” she said. “The Lahaina that we lost was a very
special and beautiful place.”</p>

id="tropical-storm-debby-moving-through-gulf-toward-florida-with-hurricane-warnings">Tropical
Storm Debby moving through Gulf toward Florida with hurricane
warnings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MIAMI, FLORIDA — A tropical depression strengthened into Tropical
Storm Debby north of Cuba on Saturday and was predicted to become a
hurricane as it moves through the Gulf of Mexico on a collision course
with the Florida coast.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center said in an update posted at 5 a.m.
Sunday that Debby was located about 195 miles (315 kilometers)
south-southwest of Tampa, Florida, and about 255 miles (410 kilometers)
south-southwest of Cedar Key, Florida. The storm was moving
north-northwest at 13 mph (20 kph) with maximum sustained winds of 50
mph (85 kph).</p>
<p>The storm was strengthening over the southeastern Gulf and expected
to be a hurricane before making landfall in the Big Bend region of
Florida, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>Wind and thunderstorms have spread over a broad area including
southern Florida, the Florida Keys and the Bahamas. A hurricane warning
and tropical storm warnings were in effect for sections of Florida’s
coast and a tropical storm watch was added for coastal Georgia in the
latest advisory.</p>
<p>Debby is likely to bring drenching rain and coastal flooding to much
of Florida’s Gulf Coast by Sunday night and predictions show the system
could come ashore as a hurricane Monday and cross over northern Florida
into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Forecasters warn it also could drop heavy rains over north Florida
and the Atlantic coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina
early next week.</p>
<p>Debby is the fourth named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season
after Tropical Storm Alberto, Hurricane Beryl and Tropical Storm Chris,
all of which formed in June.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted the system will
strengthen as it curves off the southwest Florida coast, where the water
has been extremely warm. Intensification was expected to proceed more
quickly later on Sunday.</p>
<p>A hurricane warning was issued for parts of the Big Bend and the
Florida Panhandle, while tropical storm warnings were posted for
Florida’s West Coast, the southern Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas. A
tropical storm watch extended farther west into the Panhandle. A warning
means storm conditions are expected within 36 hours, while a watch means
they are possible within 48 hours.</p>
<p>Tropical storms and hurricanes can trigger river flooding and
overwhelm drainage systems and canals. Forecasters warned of 6 to 12
inches (150mm to 300 mm) of rain and up to 18 inches (450 mm) in
isolated areas, which could create “locally considerable” flash and
urban flooding. Forecasters also warned of moderate flooding for some
rivers along Florida’s West Coast.</p>
<p>Heaviest rain could be in Georgia, South Carolina</p>
<p>Some of the heaviest rains could actually come next week along the
Atlantic Coast from Jacksonville, Florida, through coastal regions of
Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. The storm is expected to
slow down after making landfall.</p>
<p>“We could see a stall or a meandering motion around coastal portions
of the southeastern United States,” National Hurricane Center Director
Michael Brennan said in a Saturday briefing. “So that’s going to
exacerbate not just the rainfall risk, but also the potential for storm
surge and some strong winds.”</p>
<p>Flat Florida is prone to flooding even on sunny days, and the storm
was predicted to bring a surge of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 meters) along
most of the Gulf Coast, including Tampa Bay, with a storm tide of up to
7 feet (2.1 meters) north of there in the sparsely populated Big Bend
region.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned of “a danger of life-threatening storm surge
inundation” in a region that includes Hernando Beach, Crystal River,
Steinhatchee and Cedar Key. Officials in Citrus and Levy counties
ordered a mandatory evacuation of coastal areas, while those in
Hernando, Manatee, Pasco and Taylor counties called for voluntary
evacuations. Shelters opened in those and some other counties.</p>
<p>Citrus County Sheriff Mike Prendergast estimated 21,000 people live
in his county’s evacuation zone. Officials rescued 73 people from storm
surge flooding during last year’s Hurricane Idalia. Prendergast said by
phone that he hopes not to have a repeat with Debbie.</p>
<p>“After the storm surge does come in, we simply don’t have enough
first responders in our agency and among the other first responders in
the county to go in and rescue everybody that might need to be rescued,”
he said.</p>
<p>Flood preparations underway</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s
67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members.
Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp made his own emergency proclamation on
Saturday.</p>
<p>The White House said federal and Florida officials were in touch and
FEMA “pre-positioned” resources including water and food.</p>
<p>In Tampa alone, officials gave out more than 30,000 sandbags to
barricade against flooding.</p>
<p>“We’ve got our stormwater drains cleared out. We’ve got our
generators all checked and full. We’re doing everything that we need to
be prepared to face a tropical storm,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said.</p>
<p>Christina Lothrop is the general manager at Blue Pelican Marina in
Hernando Beach, a barrier island about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of
St. Petersburg. She said the public ramp was jammed Saturday with people
launching boats.</p>
<p>“Today it’s kind of normal, which is kind of weird,” Lothrop told The
Associated Press by telephone.</p>
<p>Workers at her marina have been preparing since Tuesday, however,
securing boats stored on racks, stowing tool boxes and tying everything
down.</p>
<p>“Right now what we’re doing is mostly tying up boats,” Lothrop
said.</p>
<p>Before closing Saturday, Lothrop planned to raise computers off the
floor and sandbag and tape doors. Idalia pushed about a foot of water
(30 centimeters) into the store.</p>
<p>Betti Silverman, whose home in Crystal River was under an evacuation
order, said on Saturday afternoon that she doubted her family would
leave. Silverman’s waterfront home flooded during Idalia just as her
family was moving in, ruining boxes and furniture in the garage. But she
said the forecast for Debby didn’t seem as severe.</p>
<p>“We’ve been in Florida our whole lives, in South Florida, so
hurricanes are not really a big, big thing,” Silverman said.</p>
<p>On Friday, crews pulled floating cranes away from a bridge
construction project across Tampa Bay, lashing together 74 barges and 24
floating cranes and anchoring them, project engineer Marianne Brinson
told the Tampa Bay Times. Crews also laid down cranes on land on their
sides.</p>
<p>Pinellas County paused a $5 million beach renourishment project
necessitated in part by erosion from past storms.</p>
<p>For some, the name Debby summons bad memories of a 2012 tropical
storm of the same name that caused $250 million in losses and eight
deaths, including seven in the Sunshine State. That storm dumped
torrential rains, including an astronomical 29 inches (730 mm) south of
Tallahassee.</p>
<p>More storms in the Pacific, but no threat to land</p>
<p>More than 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) off Mexico in the Pacific
Ocean, Hurricane Carlotta continued moving westward with top sustained
winds of 85 mph (140 kph). Carlotta began losing strength Saturday and
is likely to dissipate into a remnant of thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Farther west, Tropical Storm Daniel formed in the Pacific. It was
more than 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) from the southern tip of Baja
California and was also expected to dissipate without striking land.</p>

id="tribes-wait-to-get-items-back-6-months-after-museums-shut-native-exhibits">Tribes
wait to get items back, 6 months after museums shut Native exhibits</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Tucked within the expansive Native American halls of the
American Museum of Natural History is a diminutive wooden doll that
holds a sacred place among the tribes whose territories once included
Manhattan.</p>
<p>For more than six months now, the ceremonial Ohtas, or Doll Being,
has been hidden from view after the museum and others nationally took
dramatic steps to board up or paper over exhibits in response to new
federal rules requiring institutions to return sacred or culturally
significant items to tribes — or at least to obtain consent to display
or study them.</p>
<p>Museum officials are reviewing more than 1,800 items as they work to
comply with the requirements while also eyeing a broader overhaul of the
more than half-century-old exhibits.</p>
<p>But some tribal leaders remain skeptical, saying museums have not
acted swiftly enough. The new rules, after all, were prompted by years
of complaints from tribes that hundreds of thousands of items that
should have been returned under the federal Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990 still remain in museum
custody.</p>
<p>“If things move slowly, then address that,” said Joe Baker, a
Manhattan resident and member of the Delaware Tribe of Indians,
descendants of the Lenape peoples European traders encountered more than
400 years ago. “The collections, they’re part of our story, part of our
family. We need them home. We need them close.”</p>
<p>Sean Decatur, the New York museum’s president, promised tribes will
hear from officials soon. He said staff these past few months have been
reexamining the displayed objects in order to begin contacting tribal
communities.</p>
<p>Museum officials envision a total overhaul of the closed Eastern
Woodlands and Great Plains halls — akin to the five-year, $19 million
renovation of its Northwest Coast Hall, completed in 2022 in close
collaboration with tribes, Decatur added.</p>
<p>“The ultimate aim is to make sure we’re getting the stories right,”
he said.</p>
<p>Discussions with tribal representatives over the Ohtas began in 2021
and will continue, museum officials said, even though the doll does
actually not fall under the Native American Graves Protection and
Repatriation Act because it is associated with a tribe outside the U.S.,
the Munsee-Delaware Nation in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>The museum also plans to open a small exhibit in the fall
incorporating Native American voices and explaining the history of the
closed halls, why changes are being made and what the future holds, he
said.</p>
<p>Lance Gumbs, vice chairman of the Shinnecock Indian Nation, a
federally recognized tribe in New York’s Hamptons, said he worries about
the loss of representation of local tribes in public institutions, with
exhibit closures likely stretching into years.</p>
<p>The American Museum of Natural History, he noted, is one of New
York’s major tourism draws and also a mainstay for generations of area
students learning about the region’s tribes.</p>
<p>He suggests museums use replicas made by Native peoples so that
sensitive cultural items aren’t physically on display.</p>
<p>“I don’t think tribes want to have our history written out of
museums,” Gumbs said. “There’s got to be a better way than using
artifacts that literally were stolen out of gravesites.”</p>
<p>Gordon Yellowman, who heads the department of language and culture
for the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, said museums should look to create
more digital and virtual exhibits.</p>
<p>He said the tribes, in Oklahoma, will be seeking from the New York
museum a sketchbook by the Cheyenne warrior Little Finger Nail that
contains his drawings and illustrations from battle.</p>
<p>The book, which is in storage and not on display, was plucked from
his body after he and other tribe members were killed by U.S. soldiers
in Nebraska in 1879.</p>
<p>“These drawings weren’t just made because they were beautiful,”
Yellowman said. “They were made to show the actual history of the
Cheyenne and Arapaho people.”</p>
<p>Institutions elsewhere are taking other approaches.</p>
<p>In Chicago, the Field Museum has established a Center for
Repatriation after covering up several cases in its halls dedicated to
ancient America and the peoples of the coastal Northwest and Arctic.</p>
<p>The museum has completed four repatriations to tribes involving
around 40 items over the past six months, with at least three more
repatriations pending involving additional items. Those repatriations
were through efforts that were underway before the new regulations,
according to Field Museum spokesperson Bridgette Russell.</p>
<p>At the Cleveland Museum in Ohio, a case displaying artifacts from the
Tlingit people in Alaska has been reopened after their leadership gave
consent, according to Todd Mesek, the museum’s spokesperson. But two
other displays remain covered up, with one containing funerary objects
from the ancient Southwest to be redone with a different topic and
materials.</p>
<p>And at Harvard, the Peabody Museum’s North American Indian hall
reopened in February after about 15% of its roughly 350 items were
removed from displays, university spokesperson Nicole Rura said.</p>
<p>Chuck Hoskin, chief of the Cherokee Nation, said he believes many
institutions now understand they can no longer treat Indigenous items as
“museum curiosities” from “peoples that no longer exist.”</p>
<p>The leader of the tribe in Oklahoma said he visited the Peabody this
year after the university reached out about returning hair clippings
collected in the early 1930s from hundreds of Indigenous children,
including Cherokees, forced to assimilate in the notorious Indian
boarding schools.</p>
<p>“The fact that we’re in a position to sit down with Harvard and have
a really meaningful conversation, that’s progress for the country,” he
said.</p>
<p>As for Baker, he wants the Ohtas returned to its tribe. He said the
ceremonial doll should never have been on display, especially arranged
as it was among wooden bowls, spoons and other everyday items.</p>
<p>“It has a spirit. It’s a living being,” Baker said. “So if you think
about it being hung on a wall all these years in a static case,
suffocating for lack of air, it’s just horrific, really.”</p>

Pino and crew have moved a lot in the past month. On the first of July,
we were in Sitka, Southeast Alaska, and then on the last day of the
month we were back in Millbrook Cove, very near to the top of Vancouver
Island. We sailed 590 NM and stopped in 15 different anchorages.
</p>
<p>
Leaving Sitka, we sailed along the west coast of Southeast Alaska for a
few days to try and take advantage of a good weather window, we had some
engine issues which too motivated the need for such a long passage(see
our
<a href="https://100r.co/media/content/maps/sealaska_2024.jpg" target="_blank">track</a>)—we
spent two days troubleshooting the issue while anchored in Port Bazan, a
bay far from everything, with no internet connection or way to talk to
anybody, we were glad to have the physical engine manual on board.
Sailing on open waters is always nice, we saw black-footed albatrosses,
horned puffins, a whale per hour, and many more sea otters(Port Bazan
was full of them).
</p>
<p>
After checking back into
<a href="https://100r.co/site/prince_rupert.html" target="_blank">Prince
Rupert</a>, the way back south through Northern Canada was plagued with
unfavorable winds, we had to beat into it, or travel on quiet waters to
make progress. We resorted to doing short hops between anchorages,
conditions did not permit for long distances. Doing short hops though
did allow us to discover beautiful places we might have otherwise
missed. We spent many grey days waiting for weather, reading, drawing,
and beginning work on

wildfires rage in US, volunteers save animals with warm hearts and cool
heads</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COHASSET, California — While firefighters continued to battle
California’s biggest wildfire of the year, Norm Rosene was spending
18-hour days behind fire lines with a different task –- saving the
animals.</p>
<p>Tucked in an old wooden barn in the decimated forest town of Cohasset
in northern California, his team stumbled upon a calf that appeared to
be just a few days old. Its mother protectively hovered over her baby
while it nursed.</p>
<p>“It’s critical for us to get feed and water … especially because the
temperature is supposed to go up to the hundreds (above 37 degrees
Celsius) over the next few days,” said the 66-year-old volunteer. “They
drink a lot of water, especially the mom’s going to need water and food
to be able to nurse the calf.”</p>
<p>He made sure any smoldering hay or small fires still burning near the
barn were extinguished, alerted nearby firefighters and moved on to the
next home.</p>
<p>With more than 26,000 residents evacuated due to the Park Fire and
over 1,554 square kilometers scorched as of Wednesday, there were cats,
dogs, chickens, horses, and goats left behind.</p>
<p>Worried owners depend on volunteers like Rosene to rescue their
beloved pets and keep their livestock alive until they can return to
their homes.</p>
<p>“If people can’t take their animals, they sometimes want to stay,”
Rosene said. “So if we can come and help them take their animals, then
they will come out of that disaster area and they are safer and they
feel better because they didn’t leave their animals behind.”</p>
<p>When the Park Fire started last Wednesday, Rosene at first thought it
wouldn’t come his direction. But by evening, the winds had changed. He
and his wife Janice evacuated his home in Chico around 1 a.m.</p>
<p>“It’s almost terrifying because the wind was blowing and the fire was
roaring and it’s coming right at you and the embers are like fireflies
just darting all over the sky,” Rosene said, showing images of a blood
red sky blanketed with billowing columns of black smoke.</p>
<p>But the fire burned through his area quickly and thankfully left his
house intact. Within hours, he and his wife were already at work
evacuating animals.</p>
<p>The couple began volunteering 12 years ago with the North Valley
Animal Disaster Group, a team of now about 300 volunteers. They’re
trained for all types of disasters, from floods to fires, and nearly
every type of rescue you could think of – helicopter rescue, high angle
rope rescue, search and rescue – as well as animal behavior and
handling.</p>
<p>“That’s why our team is allowed to go behind fire lines and work
within the fire disaster system because we integrate with them and we
don’t get in the way of the firefighters,” Rosene said. “They like
having us back there because when they find an animal they don’t know
what to do with it.”</p>
<p>They’ve dealt with all types of animals, and Rosene is team’s
designated snake-and-lizard handler. He’s even evacuated two giant emus
and their chicks. Every pet is worth saving.</p>
<p>For large animals, the goal is to keep them where they are, as long
as they’re safe.</p>
<p>“When they get stressed by fire and smoke … now you try to load them
into a trailer or truck it can be a real challenge,” he said.</p>
<p>If they have to be evacuated, Rosene and others will coax them into
the back of their trailer and take them to the Camelot Equestrian Park.
Smaller animals like cats and dogs are taken to an emergency shelter in
Oroville.</p>
<p>Sometimes owners will bring in their animals if they are unable to
care for them, Rosene said. There are about 100 in the small animal
shelter and 70 in the large animal shelter from the Park Fire, and they
are taking care of 850 more within the evacuation area.</p>
<p>Even if the fire is out in an area, it can take days for an
evacuation order to lift. Crews have to clear the numerous hazards that
appear in the aftermath of a fire, such as falling trees and power
lines, exposed nails and broken glass, and tree holes filled with
embers.</p>
<p>During the devastating Camp Fire in 2018, which destroyed several
towns including nearly the entire community of Paradise, Rosene and
others helped more than 4,000 displaced animals. He and group founder
John Maretti have traveled to more than a dozen countries to teach and
respond to disasters.</p>
<p>“If there’s one lesson here, it’s for people to be prepared to take
their pets with them during a fire,” Rosene said. “So if they have a go
bag for themselves, they should have a go bag for their pets.”</p>

campaign staffs up in battleground states, ‘Sun Belt’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Delaware — Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential
campaign is staffing up in battleground states over the next two weeks
including in the ‘Sun Belt’ that increasingly looked out of reach for
President Joe Biden, citing momentum for her White House bid as
grassroots engagement and fundraising soar. </p>
<p>“Our grassroots engagement is proving that Kamala Harris is strong in
both the Sun Belt and the Blue Wall — with multiple pathways to 270
(electoral votes),” wrote Dan Kanninen, the campaign’s battleground
states director in a memo on Saturday. </p>
<p>The Sun Belt refers to states including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada,
and the Blue Wall includes Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. U.S.
President Joe Biden won all six of those states in 2020 by thin margins,
but just weeks ago, his campaign said the Sun Belt and North Carolina
looked increasingly out of reach. </p>
<p>Harris energizes race</p>
<p>Harris’ takeover of the Democratic presidential campaign has injected
new energy, money and enthusiasm into the race, which is translating
into a shift in polls that show her pulling even with Republican former
President Donald Trump or ahead in some battleground states. </p>
<p>Since Biden endorsed Harris on July 21, 200,000 volunteers have
joined the Harris campaign, while over 350,000 supporters attended their
first phone bank, rally or other campaign event - an over 350% increase
in event attendees, Kanninen said. </p>
<p>Harris’ campaign announced on Friday it raised $310 million in July,
fueled by small-dollar donations. </p>
<p>In the next two weeks, the campaign will add 150 more staff in the
“Blue Wall,” and will more than double its staff in Arizona and North
Carolina, Kanninen said. </p>
<p>Harris campaign operations on the ground are more extensive than
Trump’s, he said. </p>
<p>“In Nevada, Team Harris has 13 offices, while Trump has just one,”
Kanninen wrote. “In Pennsylvania, we have 36 coordinated offices while
Trump has just three. In Georgia, we have 24 offices while the Trump
team didn’t open their first until June.” </p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not immediately confirm the accuracy of those
numbers, and it did not respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>This week Trump’s campaign was set to launch a $10 million
advertising blitz in six battleground states. A super PAC supporting
Trump, MAGA Inc., kicked off a parallel ad blitz after it said it will
spend $32 million in three states with new ads criticizing Harris. </p>
<p>Some political experts have questioned Trump’s lack of campaign
infrastructure in recent days. </p>
<p>“Those of us who are interested in voting are like, ‘Why don’t you
need a ground game?’” political historian Heather Cox Richardson said in
a Facebook livestream. “It really takes feet on the ground, knuckles on
doors, meetings with people, everything to get money circulating. He is
not trying to get enough votes.” </p>
<p>Search for running mate. continues</p>
<p>Harris was expected to meet in person this weekend with the top
contenders vying to join the ticket as the candidate for vice president,
Reuters reported on Friday, citing sources.  </p>
<p>She will meet with leading contenders Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and
Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro for interviews on Sunday, according
to sources familiar with her plans.  </p>
<p>Other top names include U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg,
U.S. Senator Mark Kelly, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear and Illinois
Governor J.B. Pritzker. </p>
<p>Harris held a marginal one-percentage-point lead over Trump in a
recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, closing the gap that opened in the final
weeks of Biden’s reelection bid. </p>
<p>The three-day poll showed Harris supported by 43% of registered
voters, with Trump supported by 42%, within the poll’s 3.5 percentage
point margin of error.</p>

id="katie-ledecky-swims-into-olympics-history-winning-800-freestyle-in-paris">Katie
Ledecky swims into Olympics history, winning 800 freestyle in Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NANTERRE, France — Every year on August 3, Katie Ledecky is reminded
of her first Olympic gold medal. </p>
<p>She was just 15 years old, a reserved high schooler who had
surprisingly made the U.S. swim team for the London Games. Then she went
out and shocked the world, beating everyone in the 800-meter
freestyle. </p>
<p>Twelve years to the day, Ledecky did it again. </p>
<p>Not a stunner, but one for the ages. </p>
<p>Gold medal No. 9. </p>
<p>Ledecky capped another stellar Olympics by becoming only the second
swimmer to win an event at four straight Summer Games, holding off
Ariarne Titmus, the “Terminator,” to win the 800 free Saturday
night. </p>
<p>It was Ledecky’s second gold medal in Paris and the ninth of her
remarkable career, which marked another milestone. </p>
<p>She became only the sixth Olympian to reach that figure, joining
swimmer Mark Spitz, track star Carl Lewis, Soviet gymnast Larisa
Latynina, and Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi in a tie for second place. </p>
<p>The only athlete to win more golds: swimmer Michael Phelps with
23. </p>
<p>Ledecky was very aware of the significance of the date. </p>
<p>“Every August 3rd, the video [of her first Olympic gold] gets posted
somewhere and you kind of reminisce,” she said. “So, when I saw it was
August 3rd, I was like, ‘Oh boy, I’ve got to get the job done.’” </p>
<p>That she did, going faster than her winning time in Tokyo to finish
in 8 minutes, 11.04 seconds. Titmus was right on her shoulder nearly the
entire race, but Ledecky pulled away in the final 100. </p>
<p>Titmus, who beat Ledecky in the 400 freestyle, settled for silver at
8:12.29. The bronze went to another American, Paige Madden at
8:13.00. </p>
<p>Phelps had been the only swimmer to win the same event at four
straight Olympics, taking gold in the 200 individual medley at Athens,
Beijing, London and Rio de Janeiro. </p>
<p>Now he’s got company. </p>
<p>Titmus added some perspective to Ledecky’s consistency over the last
dozen years, noting where she was when the American won that first gold
in London. </p>
<p>“I was in grade six in primary school,” Titmus said. “That’s how
remarkable she is.” </p>
<p>Their friendly rivalry has driven both to greater heights. They each
won two golds and four medals at these games, which pushed Ledecky to 14
overall and left the 23-year-old Aussie with four golds and eight medals
in her career. </p>
<p>“To think that eight years later, I challenged her into her fourth
consecutive in the 800 is pretty cool,” Titmus said. “So I’m really
proud of myself and I feel very honored and privileged to be her rival,
and I hope I’ve made her a better athlete. She has certainly made me
become the athlete I am. I felt so privileged to race alongside
her.” </p>
<p>Dominant for a dozen years</p>
<p>Ledecky has dominated the distance freestyle events over the last
dozen years — and isn’t done yet. She’s made it clear she plans to keep
swimming at least through the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It’s not easy,” Ledecky said. “I’ll take it year by year, and we’ll
see if I can keep giving everything I’ve got for as long as I have left
in me.” </p>
<p>Another gold for Canadian teenager  </p>
<p>Summer McIntosh stamped herself as one of the swimming stars of the
Paris Olympics with her third individual gold medal, winning the 200
individual medley. </p>
<p>The 17-year-old Canadian chased down American Alex Walsh and held off
another U.S. swimmer, Kate Douglass, to finish in an Olympic record of
2:06.56. </p>
<p>Douglass grabbed the silver in the star-studded final at 2:06.92, but
the Americans lost the bronze when Walsh, the silver medalist in this
event at Tokyo who recorded a time of 2:07.06, was disqualified because
she did not finish the backstroke segment on her back. </p>
<p>Kaylee McKeown, who touched fourth, was bumped up to the bronze at
2:08.08. </p>
<p>It was a bitter blow for Walsh, whose younger sister, Gretchen, has
won a gold medal and two silvers in Paris. </p>
<p>McIntosh set several world records ahead of the Paris Olympics, and
she backed up the enormous expectations by claiming a starring role at
La Defense Arena along with Léon Marchand and Ledecky. </p>
<p>McIntosh also won gold medals in the 200 butterfly and 400 IM, plus a
silver in the 400 freestyle. She fell just 0.88 seconds — the margin of
her loss to Titmus — shy of matching Marchand’s four individual
golds. </p>
<p>“It’s pretty surreal,” said McIntosh, who became the first Canadian
athlete to win three golds in a single Olympics. “I’m just so proud of
myself and how I’ve been able to recover and manage events. </p>
<p>US sets world record </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The United States made up for a disappointing showing in Tokyo by
setting a world record in the 4x100 mixed medley relay. </p>
<p>Ryan Murphy, Nic Fink, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske held off China
for a winning time of 3:37.43, breaking the mark of 3:37.58 set by
Britain when it won gold in the wild and woolly event’s Olympic debut
three years ago. </p>
<p>With each team picking two men and two women, the U.S. and China both
went with their male swimmers in the first two legs. </p>
<p>Murphy put the U.S. in front on the backstroke, China’s Qin Haiyang
slipped past Nic Fink on the breaststroke, but Walsh put the Americans
back in front on the butterfly before Huske held off Yang Junxuan to
secure the gold. </p>
<p>The Chinese team, which also included Xu Jiayu and Zhang Yufei, took
silver in 3:37.55. The bronze went to Australia in 3:38.76. </p>
<p>Marchand swam the breaststroke leg for France but couldn’t add to his
already impressive haul of four individual golds. The French finished
fourth, more than two seconds behind the Aussies. </p>
<p>When the British won gold in 2021, the Americans finished fifth.
Britain was seventh this time. </p>
<p>Hungarian claims butterfly gold </p>
<p>Kristóf Milák of Hungary won the men’s 100 butterfly, chasing down
three swimmers on the return lap. </p>
<p>Milák was only fourth at the turn, but he rallied to touch in 49.90.
Canada grabbed the silver and bronze, with Josh Liendo finishing in
49.99 and Ilya Kharun next at 50.45. </p>
<p>Milák had failed to defend his Olympic title in the 200 butterfly,
settling for a silver behind French star Marchand. </p>
<p>Milák claimed silver in the 100 fly three years ago, but he didn’t
have to worry about the guy who beat him in that race. American Caeleb
Dressel stunningly failed to qualify for the final, posting only the
13th-fastest time in the semifinals Friday. </p>
<p>Kharun added another bronze to the one he garnered in the 200
butterfly.</p>

rejects Trump’s idea to debate her on FOX with live audience</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>reuters — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump proposed to
debate Democratic U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Fox News on
September 4, and the Harris campaign said Trump is trying to back out of
a debate that had been set to run on ABC. </p>
<p>The rules would be similar to the first debate with President Joe
Biden, who has since dropped his reelection bid, Trump said in a post on
Truth Social late Friday. But this time it would have a “full arena
audience” and take place in the battleground state of Pennsylvania,
Trump said. </p>
<p>Trump and Biden had agreed to a second debate on September 10 on ABC
News which the former president had suggested should be moved to Fox,
the most popular network with his followers. </p>
<p>Harris, who on Friday secured the delegate votes needed to clinch the
Democratic nomination for the November 5 election, said Saturday that
she plans to participate in the originally planned debate. </p>
<p>“It’s interesting how ‘any time, any place’ becomes ‘one specific
time, one specific safe space,’” she wrote on social media platform X.
“I’ll be there on Sept. 10, like he agreed to. I hope to see him
there.” </p>
<p>Trump ‘running scared,’ says Harris camp</p>
<p>Harris spokesperson Michael Tyler said Trump is “running scared” and
that her campaign is happy to discuss further debates after the
September 10 one that “both campaigns have already agreed to.” </p>
<p>On Saturday, Trump said on Truth Social that Harris is “afraid to do
it” and that he will see her on September 4, “or I won’t see her at
all.” </p>
<p>On Friday he said that the ABC debate had been “terminated” in that
Biden would no longer be in it and because he himself was in litigation
with ABC. </p>
<p>ABC on July 26 outlined qualification requirements for the debate but
did not mention any candidates by name. </p>
<p>Requirements include proving polling support and state ballot access
by September 3. </p>
<p>Recent polls show a tight contest between Harris and Trump, who had
enjoyed a bigger lead over Biden after the first debate. </p>
<p>ABC News had no comment about whether Trump had dropped out of the
debate, a spokesperson said. </p>
<p>Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>Trump’s proposal for the debate on Fox came right after the
Democratic National Committee launched an advertising campaign Friday
taunting him by saying “the convicted felon is afraid to debate” and
questioning whether that is due to his stance on abortion. </p>
<p>David Plouffe, an adviser to former President Barack Obama who
recently joined the Harris campaign, posted on social media: “Now, he
seems only comfortable in a cocoon, asking his happy place Fox to host a
Trump rally and call it a debate. Maybe he can only handle debating
someone his own age.” </p>
<p>Trump is 78 and Harris is 59. </p>
<p>Former Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who turns 100 on Oct. 1,
said, “I’m only trying to make it to vote for Kamala Harris,” the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Saturday.</p>
