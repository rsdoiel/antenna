## Google Is Mind-Bogglingly Bad

date: 2024-07-19, from: Om Malik blog

A few days ago I&#160;wondered&#160;aloud, “What&#160;would happen if&#160;Google CEO&#160;Sundar Pichai decided to sign up for Google Cloud using a secret identity, without getting help from any of his&#160;staff?”&#160;I added, “Every single CEO should try&#160;to&#160;use their service as if they were a new customer that the company is going to try and win over.

## Vineyard Wind Has Some Explaining to Do

date: 2024-07-19, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk0MDg2Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NDcyODg5N30.lkaqUEIdmRjMGeVVkr5wmXmTLV3XdPaxdGmVi6N-NFs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> A raging wildfire disrupted traffic at Turkey’s Izmir airport • The North Central Plains are on alert for severe thunderstorms • It’s about 70 degrees Fahrenheit and sunny in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where President Biden is self-isolating with COVID.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
	1. Climate groups ‘split’ on Biden’s 2024 decision
</h3><p>
	With reports swirling that President Biden is likely to announce his departure from the 2024 presidential race this weekend, <em>Reuters</em> says that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/climate-groups-split-over-whether-biden-should-pass-torch-2024-07-18/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-otZLbu4F40f3Lj4FqC_tEb9JvPxJlbmzMJZBvrahrmcDw1Dtn0N7HUtITE9ur1ydM-9w" target="_blank">climate groups are “split” on the issue</a>. The outlet contacted eight environmental groups for their take on whether Biden should step aside. Two (the Sunrise Movement and Climate Defiance) said yes. One (the Sierra Club) said no. The others were undecided or didn’t want to comment. “Joe Biden’s inability to campaign coherently and articulate an alternative to the far right will result in lower turnout among potential Democratic voters faced with a choice between two old white men clinging to power,” said Evan Drukker-Schardl, an organizer with Climate Defiance.
</p><h3>
	2. Most of U.S. will likely be hotter than normal next month
</h3><p>
	“If you like this summer’s heat, I have some good news for you,” <a href="https://x.com/Climatologist49/status/1814027819263144111?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-otZLbu4F40f3Lj4FqC_tEb9JvPxJlbmzMJZBvrahrmcDw1Dtn0N7HUtITE9ur1ydM-9w" target="_blank">quipped</a> climatologist Brian Brettschneider after seeing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/multi_season/13_seasonal_outlooks/color/page2.gif?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-otZLbu4F40f3Lj4FqC_tEb9JvPxJlbmzMJZBvrahrmcDw1Dtn0N7HUtITE9ur1ydM-9w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">monthly temperature and precipitation outlook</a> for August. It’s expected to be hotter than normal across the vast majority of the contiguous United States next month. That’s looking especially certain for the north-central Rockies (Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah) and the Central Applachians (West Virginia and the Carolinas). As for rain, it’ll likely be dryer than normal out West, and wetter than normal in the Southeast.

	3. Vineyard Wind’s broken turbine mess outrages Nantucket locals
</h3><p>
	Another large chunk of the Vineyard Wind farm’s damaged turbine <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/vineyard-wind-incident-was-not-first-time-ge-vernova-wind-turbine-came-apart-2024-07-18/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-otZLbu4F40f3Lj4FqC_tEb9JvPxJlbmzMJZBvrahrmcDw1Dtn0N7HUtITE9ur1ydM-9w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke off</a> and fell into the ocean yesterday. A blade sustained damage over the weekend and foam and fiberglass debris has been washing up on Nantucket beaches. Thursday’s incident involved “a significant part” of what remained of the blade, Vineyard Wind said in <a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2024/7/17/vineyard-wind-update-on-damged-ge-vernova-blade?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-otZLbu4F40f3Lj4FqC_tEb9JvPxJlbmzMJZBvrahrmcDw1Dtn0N7HUtITE9ur1ydM-9w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a statement</a>. The company <a href="https://x.com/ACKCurrent/status/1814266449906520186?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-otZLbu4F40f3Lj4FqC_tEb9JvPxJlbmzMJZBvrahrmcDw1Dtn0N7HUtITE9ur1ydM-9w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the blade had settled on the ocean floor. Vineyard’s CEO Klaus Moeller found out about the new damage during a <a href="https://x.com/ACKCurrent/status/1814130123878072801?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-otZLbu4F40f3Lj4FqC_tEb9JvPxJlbmzMJZBvrahrmcDw1Dtn0N7HUtITE9ur1ydM-9w" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">particularly tense</a> meeting with outraged Nantucket community members, during which he tried (but failed) to reassure them the debris is not toxic.
</p><p>
	Cleanup crews are trying to collect the debris but “current weather conditions create a difficult working environment.” Apparently this isn’t the first time a turbine manufactured by GE Verona has broken apart. There have been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/vineyard-wind-incident-was-not-first-time-ge-vernova-wind-turbine-came-apart-2024-07-18/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-otZLbu4F40f3Lj4FqC_tEb9JvPxJlbmzMJZBvrahrmcDw1Dtn0N7HUtITE9ur1ydM-9w" target="_blank">reports</a> of similar incidents in the U.K., Germany, and Sweden in recent years. Vineyard Wind has halted all operations while an investigation goes ahead.

<span></span>4. IEA report: Global electricity demand is soaring
</h3><p>
	Clean energy expansion needs to speed up to keep pace with the growing demand for electricity, according to <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-mid-year-update-july-2024?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8-otZLbu4F40f3Lj4FqC_tEb9JvPxJlbmzMJZBvrahrmcDw1Dtn0N7HUtITE9ur1ydM-9w" target="_blank">a mid-year electricity update</a> from the International Energy Agency. Key takeaways from the forecast:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Electricity demand will grow by 4% this year</strong>, up from 2.5% last year and the highest growth rate since 2007. Intense heat waves, economic growth, and adoption of electric appliances and vehicles are key contributors.</li>
<li><strong>Renewables’ share of the global electricity supply mix will reach 35%</strong> next year, up from 30% in 2023.</li>
<li>Solar power is the real workhorse, projected to meet 50% of the demand growth through 2025. </li>
<li><strong>Renewables will surpass coal next year</strong> for the first time, but coal power won’t decline just yet because of soaring demand in India (where electricity demand will surge by “a massive” 8% this year) and China (where demand will be up 6%).</li>
<li>U.S. energy demand will grow by 3%. Power sector emissions in the States are projected to grow this year, but decline next year.</li>
<li><strong>Global electricity emissions will plateau</strong> through 2025.</li>
<li>Data centers need more reliable information regarding their electricity consumption as artificial intelligence grows.</li>
</ul><p>
	While we’re “heading fast towards an electric future,” said Dave Jones, insight director at energy think tank Ember, “we need to be building renewables at double speed, to make power sector emissions fall as fast as they need to.”

<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I’m Luke, I’m 29, and I live in Chicago with my partner and five cats. I grew up in Austin, Texas. I was homeschooled—which was horrific—and haven’t gone to college yet.</p>
<p>I’m in-between jobs at the moment; I’ve been looking for IT and web development work. For the last eleven years I’ve been doing web design on the side in addition to full-time jobs in electrical, HVAC, apartment maintenance, logistics brokering, and healthcare IT. Web design and working in tech was The Dream™ for a long time; with each new non-tech job I kept telling myself it was just a brief interlude before I was “discovered” and hired for a wonderful position doing what I love. But experience and rejection slowly eroded the naivety away. I still love this stuff but with how turbulent things have been in the industry these last few years, I’ve been looking at what else I can do for a career besides drawing rectangles and making logos bigger.</p>
<p>My hobbies include blogging (whoa), playing video games, reading books, listening to music, and coding. Lately I’ve been playing Helldivers 2, Diablo IV, and Rimworld. Learning Go has been an obsession for the last year and I’ve been having fun building a form handler. The code is a complete mess right now but a couple weeks ago I got it to take a form submission and send me an email—which made me so excited that I haven’t touched the project since.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>My first blog was on Blogger in 2010. I frequented a number of forums at the time and I saw other people had their blogs linked in their signature, and I thought it was cool to have a spot all my own for topics that didn’t fit the theme of those forums. Early posts centered around the computer forum I started during that time.</p>
<p>In March 2011 I moved to WordPress and decided the previous posts weren’t worth moving, and their teenage angst is lost to time. Frustrated with WordPress, I moved over to Tumblr for a couple months before pulling a 180 and moving right back to WordPress in June 2011. My posts continued to revolve around running my forums—now multiple—and random computer activities I was up to that day.</p>
<p>In 2013 I switched to Anchor CMS (RIP Charlotte). This is when the first rendition of the cactus logo I use on my site showed up. I <em>loved</em> the Markdown approach to blogging after fighting the WordPress editor, but I wasn’t able to delete comments and I missed the WordPress media gallery. Later that same year I moved to WordPress for the third time. For the next couple of years I wrote about my solutions to problems I encountered and my adventures in Elite: Dangerous.</p>
<p>2016 saw a decline in posts and the beginning of a 4-year hiatus from blogging altogether. I met my partner that same year. Embarrassed by my teenage self and uncertain how to market my web design services, I took down the blog and switched my site to a resume-like Gatsby template. </p>
<p>I started things back up again in 2020 with the fourth return to WordPress, this time embracing the Gutenberg editor and boasting about how not-Jamstack my site was—out of exasperation with Gatsby’s build times. But as usual at this point, my time on WordPress wouldn’t last long and in 2021 I moved to Eleventy, followed by Hugo a few months later.</p>
<p>For the first year after my return to blogging, I mainly wrote about web development and tech. In 2022 I grew tired of this; I love those things but they can be incredibly dry and I wanted to express myself more. I started writing more about life and posted about <a href="https://www.lkhrs.com/blog/2022/08/wiper-adventure/">my trip to purchase wiper blades</a>, which became a reader favorite. I went back and forth on whether to separate the tech posts or keep posting through it, and ultimately decided it doesn’t matter. I write about what interests me and let the people following my blog decide for themselves.</p>
<p>My blog also functioned as my portfolio, and I went back and forth on this for years until I removed the portfolio and business parts for good a couple years ago. I felt like trying to attract business on my personal site limited what I could write about, and it was so freeing to finally rip that stuff out. </p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>I consume an unhealthy amount of articles every day and a lot of my inspiration comes from the excellent people who live in my RSS reader. I’ll get an idea in my head and start writing to uncover more meaning behind it—like sculpting but less cool. Sometimes I start with a good title and then the rest flows out as I think through it in real time. Other times I might be journaling my thoughts and a sentence will grow into three paragraphs, a title will appear, and eventually the whole mess finds its way into my blog. I try to publish posts the same day I start them; my drafts folder is where posts go to die.</p>
<p>I research almost every post, which is a problem because I can get way too into the research portion and kill my writing flow. Even the personal posts will have me going through maps and photos to make sure I’ve got the story and names straight. I keep reminding myself that I don’t need to provide proof for absolutely everything.</p>
<p>On days or topics where I feel less confident I ask my partner to proofread. I re-read what I write about 15-20 times and when the frustration reaches a breaking point I switch to Sublime Merge, close my eyes, hit the keys to stage/commit/push, and whisper a prayer to the gods of blogging.</p>
<p>Once a post is published I have a habit of re-reading what I wrote 5–10 <em>more</em> times because the context switch from my editor to the wild web tends to inspire additional changes. I consider this part an unhealthy obsession and I’m working on not doing that and posting carefree to the wind.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>My ideal creative environment is on an airplane mid-flight after they’ve passed out the complimentary snacks and drinks that you can’t taste because you’ve temporarily surfaced above nature’s tender embrace, and in your newfound godhood your thoughts drift to thinking about how we never should have left the trees all those years ago. Many posts have started in the shower, where I’ll strike upon a turn of phrase that I like and then do my darnedest to remember it when I’m dry enough to type it out.</p>
<p>I can’t be airborne or in the shower perpetually, so I gladly settle for my desk in the corner with a nice cup of coffee and one of five cats in my lap. The physical space I’m in absolutely influences my creativity; I struggle to think in loud environments with sounds I can’t tune out.</p>
<p>Noise-cancelling headphones help a lot. I find being unable to hear my keystrokes to be incredibly helpful for staying in the trance-like state of the zone while writing. I put on music that I’ve either heard a bazillion times or with few lyrics. Lately my go-to has been Chicago house inspired.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>My blog is generated with Hugo and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. The domain is registered through Namecheap. My CMS is my operating system and text editor, which can be a frustrating combination at times but it works. I use Hugo’s archetypes feature to start a new post with the front matter populated, and then Hugo opens it in iA Writer. Final edits happen in Sublime Text.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>There’s a lot I’d do with hindsight. For example, I had to switch my domain from a .work to a .com TLD a few years ago because the .work TLD made it onto a few widely-used corporate firewall blocklists years after I registered mine, to the point where I couldn’t access my own website in a coffee shop one day. While preventing potential employers and coworkers from accessing my site could be a useful feature, I’d go with a boring TLD from the start.</p>
<p>I would have separated my consulting from my personal site earlier. And I would have kept my site as my main online presence, instead of dumping words into various social media platforms for five minutes of fame. A lot of those words and images are lost now.</p>
<p>I’d still switch up my tech stack with the season though. Part of me enjoys creating problems for my future self.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Domains renewal: $28 USD/year</li>
<li>Cloudflare Pages: $0</li>
</ul>
<p>Way back near the start I had banner ads, but they produced pennies a year and looked terrible. I <a href="https://ko-fi.com/lkhrs">recently set up a Ko-fi page</a> and added the link to the bottom of my blog posts, and a couple wonderful readers have funded domain renewals for the next couple of years. And I’ve been hired by people who found me via my blog—that counts, right?</p>
<p>I absolutely support monetizing personal blogs. Those recurring costs add up and it’s another avenue for people to send you warm and fuzzy feelings. But it should be tasteful. Am I running around town wearing clothing plastered with ads for the latest VC-funded grift? (No, but please reach out if that’s an option. People don’t need to know it’s me). On the blog it’s different; my literal name and persona is wrapped up in it. When I added banner ads it felt filthy, like I sold my soul to the company with the largest fraction of a penny on AdSense. It would take a large—not small—dump truck load of pennies to make me consider doing that again. The sponsored article people have tried hard, but every time I ask for the load of zinc measured in cubic yards, negotiations fall through.</p>
<p>I encourage a cautious, almost hesitant approach. Monetization should be an afterthought, not the primary goal. </p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I recommend checking out each of these blogs and interviewing their wonderful owners. A few of them have been interviewed already.</p>

<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>While writing this I came across the album <a href="https://song.link/https://music.apple.com/us/album/ease-the-work/1725718657"><em>Ease the Work</em></a> by the instrumental group Hour. It feels like a nice stroll at sunset with a cool breeze behind you and an endless expanse of tired and dusty landscape in front. It beckons you to explore its gentle swells and sweeping strings while the beat steadily plods along, kicking up little swirls of vague nostalgia. Thoughts you’ve thought before but hadn’t properly put to rest will surface and demand to be explored, to be wholly perceived; thoughts that may have first surfaced decades prior. They nibble at your attention, threatening the tranquil state of your mind, but it is effortless to cast them away. You lose yourself in the fiery sun, yearning to someday follow its passage behind the hazy horizon. Not today though. Today is a great day to write a blog post.</p>

## Hubble Studies a Potential Galactic Merger

date: 2024-07-19, from: NASA breaking news

This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image features the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 5238, located 14.5 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Canes Venatici. Its unexciting, blob-like appearance seems to resemble an oversized star cluster more than a classic image of a galaxy. Its lackluster appearance belies its complicated structure, which is the subject of […]

## Huge IT outage affects global businesses

date: 2024-07-19, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>From the BBC World Service: A raft of businesses and organizations running Microsoft&#8217;s Windows apps have been affected by a major global IT outage. Students in Bangladesh are continuing their blockade of roads across the country, in protest of a quota system on government jobs. You may think of Rome or Paris when asked about the café capital of the world – but China’s financial capital is becoming a new contender. At least that&#8217;s what Shanghai’s local government claims.</p>

## CrowdStrike issue is causing massive computer outages worldwide

date: 2024-07-19, from: OS News

Well, this sure is something to wake up to: a massive worldwide outage of computer systems due to a problem with CrowdStrike software. Payment systems, airlines, hospitals, governments, TV stations &#8211; pretty much anything or anyone using computers could be dealing with bluescreens, bootloops, and similar issues today. Open-heart surgeries had to be stopped mid-surgery, planes can&#8217;t take off, people can&#8217;t board trains, shoppers can&#8217;t pay for their groceries, and much, much more, all over the world. The problem is caused by CrowdStrike, a sort-of enterprise AV/monitoring software that uses a Windows NT kernel driver to monitor everything people do on corporate machines and logs it for&#8230; Security purposes, I guess? I&#8217;ve never worked in a corporate setting so I have no experience with software like this. From what I hear, software like this is deeply loathed by workers the world over, as it gets in the way and slows systems down. And, as can happen with a kernel driver, a bug can cause massive worldwide outages which is costing people billions in damages and may even have killed people. There is a workaround, posted by CrowdStrike: This is a solution for individually fixing affected machines, but I&#8217;ve seen responses like &#8220;great, how do I apply this to 70k endpoints?&#8221;, indicating that this may not be a practical solution for many affected customers. Then there&#8217;s the issue that this may require a BitLocker password, which not everyone has on hand either. To add insult to injury, CrowdStrike&#8217;s advisory about the issue is locked behind a login wall. A shitshow all around. Do note that while the focus is on Windows, Linux machines can run CrowdStrike software too, and I&#8217;ve heard from Linux kernel engineers who happen to also administer large numbers of Linux servers that they&#8217;re seeing a huge spike in Linux kernel panics&#8230; Caused by CrowdStrike, which is installed on a lot more Linux servers than you might think. So while Windows is currently the focus of the story, the problems are far more widespread than just Windows. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to see some major consequences here, and my &#8211; misplaced, I&#8217;m sure &#8211; hope is that this will make people think twice about one, using these invasive anti-worker monitoring tools, and two, employing kernel drivers for this nonsense.

## New guide on using generative AI for teachers and schools

date: 2024-07-19, from: Raspberry Pi (.org)

## Trump tells of attempt on his life, then abandons unity theme in lengthy convention speech

date: 2024-07-19, from: VOA News USA

MILWAUKEE — Donald Trump, somber and bandaged, accepted the GOP presidential nomination on Thursday at the Republican National Convention in a speech that described in detail the assassination attempt that could have ended his life just five days earlier before laying out a sweeping populist agenda, particularly on immigration.


The 78-year-old former president, known best for his bombast and aggressive rhetoric, began his acceptance speech with a softer and deeply personal message that drew directly from his brush with death. Moment by moment, the crowd listening in silence, Trump described standing onstage in Butler, Pennsylvania, with his head turned to look at a chart on display when he felt something hit his ear. He raised his hand to his head and saw immediately that it was covered in blood.


"If I had not moved my head at that very last instant, the assassin's bullet would have perfectly hit its mark," Trump said. "And I would not be here tonight. We would not be together."


Trump's address, the longest convention speech in modern history at just under 93 minutes, marked the climax and conclusion of a massive four-day Republican pep rally that drew thousands of conservative activists and elected officials to swing-state Wisconsin as voters weigh an election that currently features two deeply unpopular candidates.




Sensing political opportunity in the wake of his near-death experience, the often bombastic Republican leader embraced a new tone he hopes will help generate even more momentum in an election that appears to be shifting in his favor.


"The discord and division in our society must be healed. We must heal it quickly. As Americans, we are bound together by a single fate and a shared destiny. We rise together. Or we fall apart," Trump said, wearing a large white bandage on his right ear, as he has all week, to cover a wound he sustained in the Saturday shooting. "I am running to be president for all of America, not half of America, because there is no victory in winning for half of America."




While he spoke in a gentler tone than at his usual rallies, Trump also outlined an agenda led by what he promises would be the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. He repeatedly accused people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally of staging an "invasion." Additionally, he teased new tariffs on trade and an "America first" foreign policy.


Trump also falsely suggested Democrats had cheated during the 2020 election he lost — despite a raft of federal and state investigations proving there was no systemic fraud — and suggested "we must not criminalize dissent or demonize political disagreement," even as he has long called for prosecutions of his opponents.


He did not mention abortion rights, an issue that has bedeviled Republicans ever since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federally guaranteed right to abortion two years ago. Trump nominated three of the six justices who overturned Roe v. Wade. Trump at his rallies often takes credit for Roe being overturned and argues states should have the right to institute their own abortion laws.


Nor did he mention the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in which Trump supporters tried to stop the certification of his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has long referred to the people jailed in the riot as "hostages."


Indeed, Trump barely mentioned Biden, often referring only to the "current administration."


The RNC ends at an uncertain moment in the race


With less than four months to go in the contest, major changes in the race are possible, if not likely.


Trump's appearance came as Biden, the 81-year-old Democratic incumbent, clings to his party's presumptive nomination in the face of unrelenting pressure from key congressional allies, donors and even former President Barack Obama, who fear he may be unable to win reelection after his disastrous debate.


Long pressed by allies to campaign more vigorously, Biden is instead in isolation at his beach home in Delaware after having been diagnosed with COVID-19.


Hours before the balloons were scheduled to rain down on Trump and his family inside the convention hall, Biden deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks appeared nearby in Milwaukee and insisted over and over that Biden would not step aside.


"I do not want to be rude, but I don't know how many more times I can answer that," Fulks told reporters. "There are no plans being made to replace Biden on the ballot."


Strength on the program


Thursday's RNC program seemed designed to project strength and masculinity in an implicit rebuke of Biden.


Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White called Trump "a real American bad ass." Kid Rock performed a song with the chorus, "Fight, fight!," echoing the word Trump shouted on stage in Pennsylvania as Secret Service agents helped him off the stage. And wrestling icon Hulk Hogan described the former president as "an American hero."




Hogan drew a raucous response when, standing on the main stage, he ripped off his shirt to reveal a red Trump-Vance "Make America Great Again" shirt.


"As an entertainer, I try to stay out of politics," Hogan said as he briefly broke character. "I can no longer stay silent."




Like many speakers during the convention, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested that recent events were divinely inspired and that he wondered "if something bigger is going on."


"I think it changed him," Carlson said of the shooting, praising Trump for not lashing out in anger afterward.


"He did his best to bring the country together," Carlson added. "This is the most responsible, unifying behavior from a leader I've ever seen."


Former first lady Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump, the president's elder daughter and former senior adviser, joined Trump in the convention hall ahead of his speech, making their first appearances there. Neither woman spoke.


At nearly 93 minutes, the former president's speech eclipsed the 74 minutes for which he spoke eight years ago, according to the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara.


Republicans leave their convention united


The convention has showcased a Republican Party reshaped by Trump since he shocked the GOP establishment and won over the party's grassroots on his way to the party's 2016 nomination. Rivals Trump has vanquished — including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — put aside their past criticisms and gave him their unqualified support.




Even his vice presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump's choice to carry his movement into the next generation, was once a fierce critic who suggested in a private message since made public that Trump could be "America's Hitler."


Security was a major focus in Milwaukee in the wake of Trump's near-assassination. But after nearly four full days, there were no serious incidents inside the convention hall or the large security perimeter that surrounded it.


The Secret Service, backed by hundreds of law enforcement officers from across the nation, had a large and visible presence. And during Trump's appearances each night, he was surrounded by a wall of protective agents wherever he went.


Meanwhile, Trump and his campaign have not released information about his injury or the treatment he received. The former president on Thursday described his story of surviving the attack — and vowed he would not talk about it again.


"I'm not supposed to be here tonight," Trump told the packed convention hall. The crowd of thousands, which was listening in silence, shouted back, "Yes, you are."

## The Contradictions of Trump 2.0

date: 2024-07-18, from: Heatmap News

But this time, for the first time ever, Trump is also on track to outright win the presidential election he is involved in. He has opened <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/us-2024-election/trump-biden-polls" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a two-point lead</u></a> in polling averages, but some polls show <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/if-biden-stays-a-glimpse-into-a-grim-electoral-future-for-democrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a more decisive margin</u></a> in swing states; no Democrat has been <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-polling-position-election-1922686" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in a worse position</u></a> in the polls, at this point in the election, since the beginning of the century. Even Trump’s decisions — his selection of JD Vance as his vice president, for instance — suggests that Trump is planning to win.</p><p>And so it is time to begin thinking in earnest about what a Trump presidency might mean for decarbonization and the energy transition. For the next several months, Heatmap’s journalists will cover — with rigor, fairness, and perspicacity — that question. (<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>They</u></a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f" target="_self"><u>already</u></a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-cabinet" target="_self"><u>have</u></a>.)</p><p>Should Trump win, there are a few predictions we can make with relative certainty. The Trump administration will roll back the Environmental Protection Agency’s car and truck pollution rules, which Republicans describe as a tyrannical EV mandate forced on unwilling American consumers. Trump will also try to unwind the EPA’s restrictions on carbon emissions from power plants. And he will once again take the United States out of the Paris Agreement, just as he did during his first term. Trump has also pledged <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2022/07/trump-reelected-aides-plan-purge-civil-service/374842/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to reclassify</u></a> more than 50,000 federal employees as political appointees. That would make it possible for them to be fired en masse.</p><p>Make no mistake, Trump would be a disaster for American climate<em> </em>policy — and if your biggest issue is that the United States should aim to rapidly reduce its emissions of heat-trapping pollution, then you probably shouldn’t vote for him. But just because he will wreck climate change policy doesn’t guarantee that he will destroy the clean energy economy. A second Trump administration would be a bleak time for decarbonization advocates, but it would not be a hopeless time — even if we see a powerful and even Caesarist Trump administration, politics would go on. It is worth thinking about what those politics could look like ahead of time.</p><p>Trump’s first term saw no shortage of contradictions in his climate program. Trump was a climate change denier who seemed to revel in unraveling environmental programs. But he also ultimately signed the Energy Act of 2020, a bipartisan package written by Senator Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski that boosted the advanced nuclear industry, energy storage, and carbon capture, and which created programs that were later funded by Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. </p><p>Another key contradiction in Trump’s first term was the interplay of the executive and legislative branches. Trump’s political appointees — including Scott Pruitt, his notorious and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/04/03/599240768/a-look-at-the-ethical-questions-epa-administrator-scott-pruitt-is-facing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scandal-ridden</u></a> EPA chief — pursued an aggressively pro-carbon agenda, rolling back environmental protections and opening up huge new swaths of public land to oil and gas drilling. The White House kept proposing budgets that cut tens of billions of dollars from key federal programs, including the EPA and the Department of Energy.</p><p>But Congress never actually passed those budgets. It became one of the strangest two-steps of the Trump administration: Again and again, the White House would unveil a radical, lacerating budget proposal that zeroed out key programs across the federal government and sent it to Congress. The press would cover Trump’s plans to destroy federal agencies, and the public would react with alarm. Then, several months later, Congress would pass a far more conventional budget. In May 2017, for example — the peak of Trump’s post-election Republican trifecta — Congress passed a budget that <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/last-minute-congressional-budget-compromise-saves-epa-arpa-e-funding/441655/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>preserved</u></a> nearly all EPA programs and increased funding for some renewable energy programs, including ARPA-E.</p><p>This doesn’t mean that the EPA and other federal agencies survived the first Trump administration unscathed. Many federal agencies saw brain drain throughout the four years of Trump; when Biden took office in 2021, his political appointees said that their first act was to rebuild the agencies’ depleted capacity. And if Trump carried out his aspiration of firing tens of thousands of federal workers, then the agencies would be even more beset, even more dysfunctional, at the end of his next term.</p><p>But the Trump White House seemed torn between the impulse to radically restructure the administrative state and the need to finalize its own deregulatory rules. The administration’s incompetence at dotting its i’s and crossing its t’s kept getting in the way of its own agenda: While the federal government usually beats legal challenges to its own rules, the Trump administration lost <a href="https://policyintegrity.org/trump-court-roundup" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>roughly 80% of its court fights</u></a>.</p><p>Now, unlike during his first term, Trump will have a more favorable Supreme Court to work with: Conservatives now hold a 6-3 majority on the high court — and it could easily become 7-2 under a Trump administration. Last month, the Supreme Court made it harder for the regulatory state to issue any new rules, essentially subjugating agency authority to the judiciary. That could allow the Supreme Court to force a Trump initiative into law — but it could also hamstring Trump’s agencies by forcing them to do more work, to file more paperwork, to respond to even more public comments. </p><p>A second Trump presidency will differ from its prequel in at least one respect: its fossil fuel of choice. Throughout the 2016 election, Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/us/politics/trump-coal-industry.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bound his campaign</u></a> to the coal industry, pledging to bring back mining jobs and end Obama’s “war on coal.” Soon after his election, he <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/a-coal-executives-action-plan-for-trump-is-made-public/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>received a coal “action plan”</u></a> directly from Bob Murray, the CEO of what was then the country’s largest coal company. </p><p>Trump failed. Murray’s company declared bankruptcy in 2019, and coal mining jobs <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES1021210001#0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>collapsed</u></a> to a historic low in November 2020. (Coal mining employment has modestly recovered under Biden.) Now, as Heatmap columnist Paul Waldman has observed, Trump <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/coal-2024-election-trump-biden" target="_self"><u>barely talks about coal at all</u></a>; he now seems to revere the oil and gas industry. In April, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/climate/trump-oil-gas-mar-a-lago.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>met</u></a> with oil and gas executives at Mar-a-Lago and asked for $1 billion in campaign donations.</p><p>This speaks to another contradiction that’s far bigger than Trump, between the varying needs of big and small fossil fuel companies. Climate advocates sometimes talk about “the fossil fuel industry” as a monolith, but in fact it is riven with its own divisions and disagreements. Oil and natural gas companies have different demands from coal companies. There are also disagreements between large oil companies, such as ExxonMobil, whose size lets them afford higher regulatory burdens, and smaller oil and gas drillers, who oppose any regulation whatsoever. This divergence could affect how the Trump administration handles the EPA’s methane rules, which require oil companies to cap and monitor greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas drilling equipment.</p><p>Then there’s nuclear power, the country’s most prolific zero-carbon fuel, which enjoys <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>nearly unmatched bipartisan support</u></a> but which <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/474650/americans-support-nuclear-energy-highest-decade.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>some voters</u></a> are much more wary of. Many nuclear advocates see Trump as neutral on the technology, even a potential ally, but Project 2025 proposes canceling the tens of billions of dollars in nuclear subsidies that the Biden administration has proposed. That would render the industry uneconomic and force many plants to close. </p><p>These are, of course, not even the most important contradictions that will define Trump’s White House. (I remain curious, for instance, about how <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/18/trump-jd-vance-silicon-valley-musk-gop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Trump’s backers in Silicon Valley</u></a> — whose personal wealth is tied up with big American tech companies and who detest Biden’s aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement — feel about Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/world/asia/trump-taiwan-defense-chips.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>devil-may-care approach</u></a> to defending Taiwan or about J.D. Vance’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24199314/jd-vance-donald-trump-vp-antitrust-big-tech-ftc-lina-khan-elizabeth-warren-google" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>praise of Lina Khan</u></a>.) </p><p>Trump has promised to bring back manufacturing to the United States and wage a trade war on China. He also opposes electric vehicles. But some of the country’s biggest new manufacturing facilities are going to make EVs and batteries — and these are in the Republican heartland of South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, as well as the battleground state of Georgia. Trump has pledged to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act’s $7,500 tax credit for buying EVs, and Project 2025 proposes neutering the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office, which can lend money to fund new EV factories. How will those anti-decarbonization policies fit in with local Republican economies? It is not hard to imagine a world where Trump repeals the consumer tax credit for EVs and claims victory over it, but preserves the IRA’s far more lucrative 45x subsidy that rewards companies that make batteries and EVs. That would leave some of the most important pro-EV policy in the IRA intact while generating the necessary anti-climate headlines. </p><p>These focuses of ideological slippage shouldn’t make climate advocates feel more relaxed — on the contrary, some of Trump’s most authoritarian impulses have been unleashed in response to political weakness or outright unpopularity. Perhaps that’s most clear around Trump’s outright denial of climate change, which remains among the most unpopular parts of his agenda. Is it any wonder that Jeffrey Clark, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/410993-senate-confirms-climate-skeptic-to-head-doj-environment-office/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a climate-questioning environment lawyer</u></a> who Trump installed at the Justice Department, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/election-denier-trump-wanted-take-doj-pleads-5th-disbarment-hearing-rcna145341" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ultimately helped lead the department’s attempt</u></a> to overturn the 2020 election? </p><p>The great irony — you might even say tragedy — of American energy policy is that voters across the parties see energy as a culture war issue. Environmentalists dream of creating an all-renewable energy system even though it would gobble up massive amounts of land. Republicans talk about supporting nuclear power, even though the nuclear industry has always and everywhere required state support. Trump, a pile of contradictions himself, and a distracted culture warrior, will only accelerate these contradictions. I am by no means optimistic about the results. But I expect that the reality of Trump’s governance will, even on these issues, surprise us.</p>

## NVIDIA transitions fully towards open-source GPU Linux kernel modules

date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News

It&#8217;s a bit of a Linux news day today &#8211; it happens &#8211; but this one is good news we can all be happy about. After earning a bad reputation for mishandling its Linux graphics drivers for years, almost decades, NVIDIA has been turning the ship around these past two years, and today they made a major announcement: from here on out, the open source NVIDIA kernel modules will be the default for all recent NVIDIA cards. We’re now at a point where transitioning fully to the open-source GPU kernel modules is the right move, and we’re making that change in the upcoming R560 driver release. ↫ Rob Armstrong, Kevin Mittman and Fred Oh There are some caveats regarding which generations, exactly, should be using the open source modules for optimal performance. For NVIDIA&#8217;s most cutting edge generations, Grace Hopper and Blackwell, you actually must use the open source modules, since the proprietary ones are not even supported. For GPUs from the Turing, Ampere, Ada Lovelace, or Hopper architectures, NVIDIA recommends the open source modules, but the proprietary ones are compatible as well. Anything older than that is restricted to the proprietary modules, as they&#8217;re not supported by the open source modules. This is a huge milestone, and NVIDIA becoming a better team player in the Linux world is a big deal for those of us with NVIDIA GPUs &#8211; it&#8217;s already paying dividend in vastly improved Wayland support, which up until very recently was a huge problem. Do note, though, that this only covers the kernel module; the userspace parts of the NVIDIA driver are still closed-source, and there&#8217;s no indication that&#8217;s going to change.

## Linux patch to disable Snapdragon X Elite GPU by default

date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News

Not too long ago it seemed like Linux support for the new ARM laptops running the Snapdragon X Pro and Elite processors was going to be pretty good &#8211; Qualcomm seemed to really be stepping up its game, and detailed in a blog post exactly what they were doing to make Linux a first-tier operating system on their new, fancy laptop chips. Now that the devices are in people&#8217;s hand, though, it seems all is not so rosy in this new Qualcomm garden. A recent Linux kernel DeviceTree patch outright disables the GPU on the Snapdragon X Elite, and the issue is, as usual, vendor nonsense, as it needs something called a ZAP shader to be useful. The ZAP shader is needed as by default the GPU will power on in a specialized &#8220;secure&#8221; mode and needs to be zapped out of it. With OEM key signing of the GPU ZAP shader it sounds like the Snapdragon X laptop GPU support will be even messier than typically encountered for laptop graphics. ↫ Michael Larabel This is exactly the kind of nonsense you don&#8217;t want to be dealing with, whether you&#8217;re a user, developer, or OEM, so I hope this gets sorted out sooner rather than later. Qualcomm&#8217;s commitments and blog posts about ensuring Linux is a first-tier platform are meaningless if the company can&#8217;t even get the GPU to work properly. These enablement problems should&#8217;ve been handled well before the devices entered circulation, so this is very disheartening to see. So, for now, hold off on X Elite laptops if you&#8217;re a Linux user.

## Actor Bob Newhart, famous for deadpan humor, dies at 94

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Bob Newhart, who fled the tedium of an accounting job to become a master of stammering, deadpan humor as a standup comedian and later as a U.S. television sitcom star, died on Thursday at the age of 94, his publicist said.


Newhart died at his home in Los Angeles after a series of short illnesses, said his longtime publicist, Jerry Digney.


Newhart had two hit shows — first playing a psychologist on "The Bob Newhart Show" from 1972 to 1978, and then portraying a Vermont innkeeper on "Newhart" from 1982 through 1990. In both shows he relied on a bland, cardigan-clad everyman character who is confounded by the oddball people around him.


Newhart was nominated for Emmy Awards nine times, beginning in 1962 for writing on his short-lived variety show, but he did not win until 2013 when he was given the award for a guest appearance on "The Big Bang Theory."


Newhart's career began in the late 1950s, with a comedy routine in which he played straight man to an unheard voice on the other end of a telephone call. Tommy Smothers of the Smothers Brothers duo called Newhart "a one-man comedy team" because of his dialogues with invisible partners.


His 1960 live album, "The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart," was a big hit that was also highly influential. It became the first comedy album to top the charts and earned him three Grammy awards.


Newhart's characters had a trademark stammer, which he said was not an act but the way he really talked. He said a TV producer once asked him to cut down on the stammer because it was making the shows run too long.


"'No,' I told him. 'That stammer bought me a house in Beverly Hills,'" Newhart wrote in his memoir, "I Shouldn't Even Be Doing This!"


He ended his "Newhart" show in 1990 with an episode regarded as one of the most unique in the annals of U.S. television. In the last scene of the series, he awakens in bed with his wife from the first series after "dreaming" his life in the second series.




Newhart sprung from an era of angry, edgy standup comics such as Lenny Bruce, Shelley Berman and Mort Sahl, but his act was subtly subversive, without the profanity or shock used by his contemporaries.


He exploited his hesitant, bashful ordinariness to skewer society in his own fashion — including sketches about how a publicity agent would "handle" Abraham Lincoln or one featuring an inept official on the phone with a frantic man trying to defuse a bomb.


In the late 1950s, Newhart had a boring accounting job — in which he claimed that his credo was "that's close enough" — and began writing comedy sketches with a colleague as a diversion.


Those led to radio performances and eventually a record deal with Warner Bros.


"Probably the best advice I ever got in my life was from the head of the accounting department, Mr. Hutchinson, I believe, at the Glidden Company in Chicago, and he told me, 'You really aren't cut out for accounting,'" Newhart told an interviewer.


Before winning an Emmy in 2013, Newhart had been nominated three times for his acting on "Newhart," once for writing on his 1961 variety show and twice for appearances on other shows. He also was a frequent guest on variety shows and talk shows.


He appeared in several movies, including "On a Clear Day You Can See Forever," "Catch-22" and "Elf."


In 2002, he was awarded the Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. Asked by the New York Times in 2019 whether he felt 90 years old, Newhart said, "My mind doesn't. I can't turn it off."


Newhart was introduced by comedian Buddy Hackett to his future wife, Virginia, whom he married in 1964. The Newharts had four children.

## US appeals court blocks remainder of Biden's student debt plan

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court blocked the implementation of the Biden administration's student debt relief plan, which would have lowered monthly payments for millions of borrowers.


In a ruling Thursday, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals granted a motion for an administrative stay filed by a group of Republican-led states seeking to invalidate the administration's entire student loan forgiveness program. The court's order prohibits the administration from implementing the parts of the SAVE plan that were not already blocked by lower court rulings.


The ruling comes the same day that the Biden administration announced another round of student loan forgiveness, this time totaling $1.2 billion in forgiveness for roughly 35,000 borrowers who are eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.


The PSLF program, which provides relief for teachers, nurses, firefighters and other public servants who make 120 qualifying monthly payments, was originally passed in 2007. But for years, borrowers ran into strict rules and servicer errors that prevented them from having their debt canceled. The Biden administration adjusted some of the program’s rules and retroactively gave many borrowers credits toward their required payments.


Two separate legal challenges to Biden's SAVE plan have worked their way through the courts.


In June, federal judges in Kansas and Missouri issued separate rulings that blocked much of the administration's plan to provide a faster path toward loan cancellation and reduce monthly income-based repayment from 10% to 5% of a borrower's discretionary income. Those injunctions did not affect debt that had already been forgiven.


The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that allowed the department to proceed with the lowered monthly payments. Thursday's order from the 8th circuit blocks all aspects of the SAVE plan.


The Education Department said it was reviewing the ruling.


"Our Administration will continue to aggressively defend the SAVE Plan — which has been helping over 8 million borrowers access lower monthly payments, including 4.5 million borrowers who have had a zero-dollar payment each month," the administration said.

## No official information from Trump about his injuries since assassination attempt

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

milwaukee, wisconsin — Four days after a gunman's attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally, the public is still in the dark over the extent of his injuries, what treatment the Republican presidential nominee received in the hospital, and whether there may be any long-term effects on his health. 


Trump's campaign has refused to discuss his condition, release a medical report or records, or make the doctors who treated him available, leaving information to dribble out from Trump, his friends and family. 


The first word on Trump's condition came about half an hour after the shots were fired and Trump dropped to the ground. When he got up, he pumped his fist defiantly to the crowd with blood streaming down his face. The campaign issued a statement saying he was "fine" and "being checked out at a local medical facility." 


"More details will follow," his spokesperson said. 


It wasn't until 8:42 p.m., however, that Trump told the public he had been struck by a bullet as opposed to shrapnel or debris. In a post on his social media network, Trump wrote that he was "shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part" of his right ear. 


"I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin," he wrote. 


Information falls to friends, family


Presidents and major-party candidates have long had to balance their right to doctor-patient confidentiality with the public's expectations that they demonstrate they are healthy enough to serve, particularly when questions arise about their readiness. Trump, for example, has long pressed President Joe Biden to take a cognitive test as the Democrat faces doubts after his stumbling performance in last month's debate. 


"It's an understatement to say that it's bizarre that a presidential candidate has sustained an injury from an attempted assassination and no medical report is issued to describe his evaluation and the extent of his injury," Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine and surgery at The George Washington University, wrote on the website X, formerly known as Twitter, on Thursday. 


After a would-be assassin shot and gravely wounded President Ronald Reagan in 1981, the Washington hospital where he was treated gave regular, detailed public updates about his condition and treatment. 


Trump has appeared at the Republican National Convention the past three days with a bandage over his right ear. But there has been no further word since Saturday from Trump's campaign or other officials on his condition or treatment. 


Instead, it has been allies and family members sharing news. 


Representative Ronny Jackson, who served as Trump's White House doctor and traveled to be with him after the shooting, said in a podcast interview Monday that Trump was missing part of his ear — "a little bit at the top" — but that the wound would heal. 


"He was lucky," Jackson said on "The Benny Show," a conservative podcast hosted by Benny Johnson. "It was far enough away from his head that there was no concussive effects from the bullet. And it just took the top of his ear off, a little bit of the top of his ear off as it passed through." 


Jackson said the area would need to be treated with care to avoid further bleeding — "It's not like a clean laceration like you would have with a knife or a blade, it's a bullet track going by," he said — but that Trump is "not going to need anything to be done with it. It's going to be fine." 


The former president's son Eric Trump said in an interview with CBS on Wednesday that his father had had "no stitches but certainly a nice flesh wound."


Little medical information during career


The lack of information continues a pattern for Trump, who has released minimal medical information throughout his political career. 


When he first ran in 2016, Trump declined to release full medical records, and instead released a note from his doctor that declared Trump would be "the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency." 


Dr. Harold Bornstein later revealed that the glowing, four-paragraph assessment was written in 5 minutes as a car sent by Trump to collect it waited outside. 


When Trump was infected with the coronavirus in the midst of his 2020 re-election campaign, his doctors and aides tried to downplay the severity of his condition and withheld information about how sick he was and key details of his treatment. 


Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows later wrote in his book that Trump's blood oxygen dropped to a "dangerously low level" and that there were concerns that Trump would not be able to walk on his own if he had waited longer to be transported to Walter Reed for treatment.

## US sanctions Sierra Leone man, seeks extradition in migrant smuggling

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

MEXICO CITY — The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Thursday on a man from Sierra Leone who is suspected of smuggling thousands of migrants from Asia and Africa into the United States. 


The ring allegedly run by Abdul Karim Conteh provided false documents and drove migrants to the border and offered advice on how to cross, the Treasury said. It also allegedly moved some migrants through Nicaragua, the Central American country that has been used as a springboard for migrant smuggling because of its lax visa requirements. 


The smuggling ring's customers came from a dozen countries, including China, Iran, Russia, Somalia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. 


Karim Conteh was arrested on July 11 in Tijuana, Mexico. The United States is pursuing Conteh's extradition on federal migrant smuggling charges. 


Also sanctioned Thursday was his Mexican wife, Veronica Roblero, as well as two other people from Sierra Leone and Togo. 


The department's Office of Foreign Assets Control — the U.S. agency that combats illicit funds and money laundering — said the ring allegedly moved the money they charged the migrants for helping them cross the border illegally through the United States. 


The sanctions block the targets' financial and other assets in the United States and prohibit U.S. citizens from having any transactions with them.

## The Us vs. Them of Energy

date: 2024-07-18, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjg3ODI0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjkzODgwN30.cbaMvNBV_A1lfUwRymBqInNHyYvp7DP2XnJPkUa3dys/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">“We need a leader,” said JD Vance as he accepted the Republican nomination for vice president, “who rejects Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s Green New Scam and fights to bring back our great American factories.” The election, he said, is “about the auto worker in Michigan, wondering why out-of-touch politicians are destroying their jobs,” and “the energy worker in Pennsylvania and Ohio who doesn’t understand why Joe Biden is willing to buy energy from tinpot dictators across the world, when he could buy it from his own citizens right here in our own country.”</p><p>This is the tale Vance tells about energy and climate — one of contempt and betrayal, elitists sacrificing hard-working blue-collar Americans on the altar of their alien schemes. On the surface it may sound like it’s about jobs and economics, but it’s really about the eternal culture war that divides <em><em>us</em></em> from <em><em>them</em></em>. </p><p>This is nothing new. Maintaining this artificial division between environmental and economic concerns is central to the effort to protect the fossil fuel industry, and has been for decades. Voters must be convinced that any attempt to do something about climate change is not just unserious but an assault on virtuous working people waged from Washington and other places controlled by the snobbish liberal elite. </p><p>The argument plays on beliefs about environmentalism that go back decades. Beginning in the 1970s, a group of political scientists led by <a href="https://cps.isr.umich.edu/news/ronald-inglehart-obituary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ronald Inglehart</u></a> drew attention to a change in public opinion in advanced societies around the world, as “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/42863668" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>post-materialist values</u></a>” based on autonomy and self-expression grew in political prominence. The generations that grew up after World War II, they argued, were less focused on material scarcity and more concerned with issues like abortion, equal rights for women and minority groups, and the environment. </p><p>The idea that environmental concerns were separate from economics — that they are fundamentally cultural and not material — has always been used by the right to discredit environmentalism and those who advocate for it. As George H.W. Bush <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/1992/10/30/for-bush-its-political-theater/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a> about Al Gore in 1992 when Gore’s warnings about climate change were considered a little wacky, “This guy is so far off in the environmental extreme, we’ll be up to our neck in owls and out of work for every American.” </p><p>Since then, the problem has only gotten worse. But the solutions have also gotten more real.<strong> </strong></p><p>In Vance’s home state, for instance, an “energy worker” is much more likely to be working in green energy than fossil fuels; as Semafor <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/16/2024/jd-vances-energy-reversal-is-a-risky-gamble-on-ohios-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently noted</u></a>, “Clean energy-related companies now employ about 114,000 people in Ohio, compared to 71,000 working in oil and gas.” The state is enjoying something of a <a href="https://www.seia.org/blog/leading-charge-top-5-solar-states-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>solar boom</u></a>, as well as a significant increase in production of batteries that will power the electric vehicles Vance and his running mate <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>despise</u></a>. The “great American factories” Vance celebrates apparently don’t include projects like the joint LG-Honda <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/business/manufacturing/2024/02/29/honda-lg-ramp-up-hiring-as-ev-battery-plant-hits-milestone/72772147007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>battery plant</u></a> in Jeffersonville, an hour’s drive from his home town of Middletown, which will complete construction later this year and is slated to employ 2,200 of his constituents.</p><p>But in the picture painted by Trump, Vance, and others running on the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-trump-climate-debate" target="_self"><u>anti-anti-climate change agenda</u></a>, there is essentially no such thing as a green job; efforts to lower emissions have only costs and no benefits. And the cost is not just to our economy but to our spirit, making us impotent and weak. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who may well become Secretary of Energy if Trump wins, began <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5124468/governor-doug-burgum" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his convention speech</u></a> with a call-and-response to the audience. “Who will make America energy dominant?” he asked three times, to which the audience responded, “Donald Trump!” “Energy dominant” has replaced “energy independent” as the goal for the Trump-era GOP, not surprising given that dominance and submission is one of the central themes of Trump’s life.</p><p>“Energy dominance” isn’t so much a practical state of affairs as a <em><em>feeling</em></em>, the sense that our heads are held high and others grovel before us, whether that has any relation to reality or not. After all, under Joe Biden the country is about as energy dominant as it could be, and not always for the best. America is not only <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>producing more oil</u></a> than any country in the world, it’s producing more than any country in human history. We’re also the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61683" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>world’s largest exporter</u></a> of liquified natural gas. </p><p>Yet according to Burgum, the next four years will bring either an apocalypse of enfeeblement as we huddle together in darkness or an explosion of manly strength, depending on which president we elect. “Imagine: no electricity for your fridge, your lights or air conditioning,” he warned. “President Trump will ensure there’s power for you, and importantly, that we have the power as the United States to beat China in the AI arms race.” You can almost feel the <em><em>power </em></em>Trump will give you, like a steroid shot to the national soul — or a dose of something even more potent. “Teddy Roosevelt encouraged America to speak softly and carry a big stick,” Burgum went on. “Energy dominance will be the big stick that President Trump will carry.” To paraphrase Sigmund Freud, sometimes a stick is just a stick — but not this time, I think. </p><p>All that was no doubt music to the ears of the American Petroleum Institute, one of the convention’s sponsors, as well as both Trump and Vance, who has <a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-unveils-legislation-to-eliminate-biden-ev-credits-promote-domestic-auto-manufacturing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>introduced</u></a> a bill to repeal the EV subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act and replace them with subsidies for internal combustion vehicles. “The whole EV thing is a scam,” Vance has <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18102022/ohio-senate-climate-jd-vance-tim-ryan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>. </p><p>In other words: Don’t be fooled when Democrats tell you that climate change is an economic threat and that transitioning to a green economy will actually <em><em>increase </em></em>prosperity. All you need to know is that the “Green New Scam” is being imposed by the people you hate.</p><p>Those resisting climate action would prefer that voters continue to see it as solely a cultural issue, as though the environmental conversation were still confined to <a href="https://highways.dot.gov/highway-history/general-highway-history/rambler/how-highway-beautification-act-became-law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>beautifying highways</u></a> and picking up litter, something we can set aside with no material cost. But the truth is that culture and economics are entwined, and always have been. The Republicans who took the stage in Milwaukee to rail against green energy and present themselves as the protectors of the working class understand that only too well. </p>

## Wall Street Journal firing shocks chair of Hong Kong journalists group

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

BANGKOK — The newly elected chair of the Hong Kong Journalists Association says she was “shocked and appalled” to be fired by the Wall Street Journal this week, immediately after taking her position.


Selina Cheng says the media outlet terminated her contract Wednesday after she accepted the role leading the association, known as the HKJA.


Speaking with VOA, Cheng said, “I think I would not be terminated if I had complied with their request to not be chair.”


The reporter says Wall Street Journal editors had warned her that her HKJA role could be a conflict of interests because the Journal covers press freedom issues in Hong Kong.


Cheng said in a news conference that the Journal's actions called into question its commitment to press freedom, saying management is blocking employees "from advocating for freedoms the Journal reporters rely on to work, in a place where journalists and their rights are under threat."


She said the Journal is applying a double standard, noting its advocacy efforts to free American journalist Evan Gershkovich, who is on trial in Russia.




Cheng, who joined the Journal as a full-time employee in 2022, covers the electric vehicle and auto industry.


A spokesperson at Dow Jones, parent company of the  Journal, confirmed to VOA that personnel changes were made in Hong Kong on Wednesday.


When pressed over the reason to terminate Cheng’s role, the spokesperson said, “We don't comment on specific individuals. This is a newsroom decision.”


The spokesperson added, “The Wall Street Journal has been and continues to be a fierce and vocal advocate for press freedom in Hong Kong and around the world."


Conflict brewing for weeks


In a statement shared on the social media platform X on Wednesday, Cheng said that about three weeks ago, Wall Street Journal editors learned that she was running for election to be chair of HKJA.


Cheng says that her supervisor, who is based in Britain, then asked her to withdraw.


“She also asked me to quit the board — which I have served on since 2021 —even though the Wall Street Journal approved this when I was hired. This day was the day before our election,” Cheng said in a statement.


When she refused, Cheng says, her supervisor told her the role as chair “would be incompatible” with her job and that “employees of the Journal should not be seen as advocating for press freedom in a place like Hong Kong.”


Cheng told VOA she had been expecting something to happen when she refused to stop her association with the HKJA.


“There didn’t seem to be any room for discussion, and they went straight to threatening to dismiss weeks ago. I’m deeply shocked and appalled by this,” she said.


The journalist said that on Wednesday, Gordon Fairclough, the world coverage chief at the Journal, flew from Britain to Hong Kong to inform Cheng her role had been terminated as part of a restructure.


Cheng said the Journal made layoffs in Hong Kong earlier this year, but that she was kept on.


“Prior to knowing that I was going to run for chair, there wasn’t any indication [of being dismissed],” she told VOA. “In fact, I was a small number of people kept on in the newsroom and my reporting area was highlighted from our editor in chief as being one of the key areas to continue reporting on in Asia.”


Cheng told VOA she had not been asked to relocate to any other of the Journal bureaus.


Cheng has worked in Hong Kong since 2017, reporting on the umbrella protest movement, the removal of books about Tiananmen Square from libraries and a lobbying campaign that sought to revoke the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.


She previously worked at English news website the Hong Kong Free Press and Hong Kong media outlet HK01.


Association is 'outraged'


The HKJA in a statement said that it was “outraged” by the Journal’s actions. The statement says Cheng is consulting her lawyers about a potential breach of Hong Kong labor law.


“By pressuring employees not to take part in the HKJA, a key advocate for both local and international journalists working in Hong Kong, the WSJ risks hastening the decline of what space for independent journalism remains,” the statement said.


The HKJA said that other elected board members had come under similar pressure.


The HKJA has come under pressure from authorities and criticism from Chinese-state media since Beijing enacted the national security law in Hong Kong four years ago to quell dissent. The association has been criticized for alleged links to activist organizations.


Former HKJA chair Ronson Chan was sentenced to five days in jail in September for allegedly obstructing a police officer.


Chan was an editor at the now-defunct Stand News website, one of several media outlets to close for allegedly conspiring to publish seditious publications. Media executives and journalists from the outlet are on trial, with a verdict expected in August.


Press freedom in Hong Kong and East Asia have seen a decline in the past year, according to media watchdog Reporters without Borders, known as RSF.


Hong Kong ranks 135 out of 180, where 1 shows the best environment. In 2019, the year before the national security law came in, Hong Kong ranked 73.


Since the national security law was enacted, at least 28 journalists and press freedom defenders have been arrested, with 10 still in jail, and over a dozen media outlets have closed.




Aleksandra Bielakowska, an advocacy officer at RSF, says press freedom has “plummeted.” 


"While Reporters Without Borders does not comment on individual employment disputes, we want to express our support for Selina Cheng's courageous work with the Hong Kong Journalists Association,” she told VOA.


“As press freedom has sharply plummeted in Hong Kong in recent years, and as pressure has grown against foreign and domestic media operating in the territory, independent journalism is more crucial than ever,” she said.


RSF’s World Press Freedom Index lists these countries in East Asia as the most dangerous for media: China, North Korea and Vietnam.

## Can J.D. Vance's Populist Crusade Succeed?

date: 2024-07-18, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">
<p>[<a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/can-jd-vances-populist-crusade-succeed">Matt Stoller</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"So what does Vance think? He is in agreement with the views of a rising set of younger conservatives, populists like Sohrab Ahmari and Oren Cass, who assert that libertarianism is a cover for private rule, most explicitly in Ahmari’s book Tyranny, Inc. It is flourishing of the family that animates this new group, not worship of the market. At Remedy Fest, Vance was explicit in his agreement with this notion, saying “I don't really care if the entity that is most threatening to that vision is a private entity or a public entity, we have to be worried about it.”"</p></blockquote><p>An interesting analysis of JD Vance's economic ideas - at least as described here, I'm actually not in disagreement. The free market <em>is</em> cover for private rule. Lina Khan <em>is</em> doing a great job. </p><p>I'm less impressed with his backers Andreessen and Horowitz's ideas, which are tied up with military might and a self-interested misunderstanding of what happened in relation to the downfall of the USSR. The idea that Elizabeth Warren "hates capitalism" is nonsense. It's a very thin defense drawn from their particular mode of capitalism coming under threat of regulation.</p><p>The trouble is, <a href="https://werd.io/2024/the-silicon-valley-vice-president">as I've described</a>, all the social policies that go along with it. Sure, try and influence both political parties to be beneficial to your businesses all you want. But if you throw mass deportations, military policing of our cities, and fascist reconstructions of government in the mix, you'd better be ready for the repercussions.</p>

## US Army honors Nisei combat unit that helped liberate Tuscany in WWII

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

ROME — The U.S. military is celebrating a little-known part of World War II history, honoring the Japanese-American U.S. Army unit that was key to liberating parts of Italy and France even while the troops' relatives were interned at home as enemies of the state following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. 


Descendants of the second-generation "Nisei" soldiers traveled to Italy from around the United States – California, Hawaii and Colorado – to tour the sites where their relatives fought and attend a commemoration at the U.S. military base in Camp Darby ahead of the 80th anniversary Friday of the liberation of nearby Livorno, in Tuscany. 


Among those taking part were cousins Yoko and Leslie Sakato, whose fathers each served in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, which went onto become the most decorated unit in the history of the U.S. military for its size and length of service. 


"We wanted to kind of follow his footsteps, find out where he fought, where he was, maybe see the territories that he never ever talked about," said Yoko Sakato, whose father Staff Sgt. Henry Sakato was in the 100th Battalion, Company B that helped liberate Tuscany from Nazi-Fascist rule. 


The 442nd Infantry Regiment, including the 100th Infantry Battalion, was composed almost entirely of second-generation American soldiers of Japanese ancestry, who fought in Italy and southern France. Known for its motto "Go For Broke," 21 of its members were awarded the Medal of Honor. 


The regiment was organized in 1943, in response to the War Department's call for volunteers to form a segregated Japanese American army combat unit. Thousands of Nisei — second-generation Japanese Americans — answered the call. 


Some of them fought as their relatives were interned at home in camps that were established in 1942, after Pearl Harbor, to house Japanese Americans who were considered to pose a "public danger" to the United States. In all, some 112,000 people, 70,000 of them American citizens, were held in these "relocation centers" through the end of the war. 


The Nisei commemoration at Camp Darby was held one week before the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Livorno, or Leghorn, on July 19, 1944. Local residents were also commemorating the anniversary this week. 




In front of family members, military officials and civilians, Yoko Sakato placed flowers at the monument in memory of Pvt. Masato Nakae, one of the 21 Nisei members awarded the Medal of Honor. 


"I was feeling close to my father, I was feeling close to the other men that I knew growing up, the other veterans, because they had served, and I felt really like a kinship with the military who are here," she said. 


Sakato recalled her father naming some of the areas and towns in Tuscany where he had fought as a soldier, but always in a very "naive" way, as he was talking to kids. 


"They were young, it must have been scary, but they never talked about it, neither him nor his friends," Sakato said of her father, who died in 1999. 


Her cousin Leslie Sakato's father fought in France and won a Medal of Honor for his service. "It was like coming home," she said of the commemoration.

## News CEOs and the Question of News Experience

date: 2024-07-18, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

Tofel</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"I think some of those choosing these new business leaders themselves forgot about the special nature of the news business. It won’t be enough, for instance, at least in most cases, for someone who aspires to run a news organization to recognize the importance of the role of the press in democratic governance—although that ought to be essential."</p><p>"[...] More subtly, a CEO without news experience may not grasp how large of an asset is newsroom morale, or how much sapping it may cost an enterprise. Such issues can become particularly tricky in a unionized environment— especially one in which there are no profits over which to haggle, either because the organization is a nonprofit, or because it is no longer profitable."</p></blockquote><p>Dick Tofel was the founding general manager of <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>, and generally knows a thing or two about the news business.</p><p>There's a line to walk here: there's certainly risk, as Tofel describes, of picking a news CEO who is not familiar with the news business. At the same time, as I've previously lamented, <a href="https://werd.io/2024/innovation-in-news-is-an-oxymoron">the industry needs an injection of new, outside ideas</a>. It's certainly true that the CEO must deeply understand how news works, but they also can't be to afraid to change some of those dynamics - as long as they're cognizant of the position and responsibility that journalism holds in a democracy.</p><p>Any CEO needs to be very aware of organizational culture and morale. Many news CEOs are hyper-focused on their journalism (which is good!) at the expense of thinking too deeply about culture (which is bad). Hopefully any good incoming CEO would be an expert at building culture, although most of us know that this often isn't the case.</p><p>It's complicated, in other words. But journalism is at least as important as it's ever been, and getting news leadership right is crucial.</p>

## Caught in the middle of the U.S. and China

date: 2024-07-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>First, semiconductor manufacturer TSMC has seen a surge in sales, yet its stock took a hit yesterday. That followed news the U.S. might further curb exports to China and comments by former President Donald Trump that TSMC&#8217;s home base of Taiwan would need to start paying for its own defense. Then, as the U.S.-China economic relationship becomes more contentious, where does that leave Europe? We dig in. And later: why women’s health is so far behind the curve.</p>

## Unified kernel image

date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News

UKIs can run on UEFI systems and simplify the distribution of small kernel images. For example, they simplify network booting with iPXE. UKIs make rootfs and kernels composable, making it possible to derive a rootfs for multiple kernel versions with one file for each pair. A Unified Kernel Image (UKI) is a combination of a UEFI boot stub program, a Linux kernel image, an initramfs, and further resources in a single UEFI PE file (device tree, cpu µcode, splash screen, secure boot sig/key, &#8230;). This file can either be directly invoked by the UEFI firmware or through a boot loader. ↫ Hugues If you&#8217;re still a bit unfamiliar with unified kernel images, this post contains a ton of detailed practical information. Unified kernel images might become a staple for forward-looking Linux distributions, and I know for a fact that my distribution of choice, Fedora, has been working on it for a while now. The goal is to eventually simplify the boot process as a whole, and make better, more optimal use of the advanced capabilities UEFI gives us over the old, limited, 1980s BIOS model. Like I said a few posts ago, I really don&#8217;t want to be using traditional bootloaders anymore. UEFI is explicitly designed to just boot operating systems on its own, and modern PCs just don&#8217;t need bootloaders anymore. They&#8217;re points of failure users shouldn&#8217;t be dealing with anymore in 2024, and I&#8217;m glad to see the Linux world is seriously moving towards negating the need for their existence.

## The Silicon Valley Would-Be Vice President

date: 2024-07-18, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p><img src="https://werd.io/file/6699193f00f7491edb086c12/thumb.jpg" alt="A screenshot from MSNBC, showing " mass reportation now signs waving at the republican national convention width="1024" height="576"></p><p>JD Vance is an obvious, bald-faced opportunist. It makes sense that Trump would pick him as his Vice Presidential candidate; they probably understand each other quite well.</p><p>It can’t have hurt that a bevy of tech billionaires told Trump to pick him, and it’s not unreasonable to assume they gated funding on that choice. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199700/elon-musk-joe-lonsdale-america-pac-donald-trump">Elon Musk has pledged to give $45 million a month to a PAC newly formed to back Trump</a>; Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, former Yammer founder David Sacks, and VC Chamath Palihapitiya have also raised money for the group. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/07/16/trump-lands-more-big-tech-backers-billionaire-venture-capitalist-andreessen-joins-wave-supporting-former-president/">Eponymous Andreessen-Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz pledged donations</a> and Keith Rabois has also reportedly pledged a comparatively paltry $1 million. (The Winkelvoss twins are also donors, but I wouldn’t exactly call them Silicon Valley insiders.)</p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/andreessen-horowitz-co-founders-explain-why-theyre-supporting-trump/">Andreessen explained why</a>, saying that the future of America is at stake:</p><blockquote><p>Biden’s proposal to tax unrealized capital gains is what Andreessen called “the final straw” that forced him to switch from supporting the current president to voting for Trump. If the unrealized capital gains tax goes into effect, startups may have to pay taxes on valuation increases. (Private companies’ appreciation is not liquid. However, the U.S. government collects tax in dollars.)</p></blockquote><p>One could argue, of course, that the future of America <em>is</em> at stake. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/project-2025-women-education-lgbtq-workforce/">As The 19th reported about Project 2025</a>, the Heritage Foundation’s suggested plan for a next Trump administration whose authors include over 140 people who were a part of the last one:</p><blockquote><p>Much of Project 2025 relates to gender, sexuality and race, aiming to end most all of the federal government’s efforts to achieve equity and even collect data that could be used to track outcomes across the public and private sectors.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/12/project-2025-summary-trump/">other sweeping changes it proposes include</a> firing civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists, removing the Department of Education, gutting our already-insufficient climate change protections, reinstating the military draft, conducting sweeping immigration raids and mass deportations, and condemning more people to death sentences while making them swift enough to avoid retrial.</p><p>All this despite being on shaky legal ground:</p><blockquote><p>Some of these ideas are impractical or possibly illegal. Analysts are divided about whether Trump can politicize the civil workforce to fire them at will, for example. And the plan calls for using the military to carry out mass deportations on a historic scale, which could be constitutionally iffy.</p></blockquote><p>Trump has lately distanced himself from the plan in public, but privately <a href="https://x.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1811402883604050216">said something quite different at a Heritage Foundation dinner</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do, and what your movement will do, when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.”</p></blockquote><p>For his part, Kevin Roberts, the President of the Heritage Foundation, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/project-2025/heritage-foundation-president-celebrates-supreme-court-immunity-decision-we-are">said out loud on Steve Bannon’s podcast</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.</p></blockquote><p>JD Vance is walking this line too. My employer, ProPublica, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/jd-vance-alex-jones-leonard-leo-teneo-maddow-video">recently reported that he, among other things</a>, believes that the Devil is real, and that he had some unpleasant things to say about trans people:</p><blockquote><p>He said that Americans were “terrified to tell the truth” and “point out the obvious,” including that “there are real biological, cultural, religious, spiritual distinctions between men and women.” He added, “I think that’s what the whole transgender thing is about, is like fundamentally denying basic reality.”</p></blockquote><p>So, yes, all things considered, it feels a bit like America is in the balance.</p><p>What’s particularly bald about involvement from the Silicon Valley crowd is that they are, according to them, overlooking all of this and concentrating solely on their business interests. If policies like a tax on unrealized capital gains or tighter anti-trust actions are enacted, those investors may have to re-think some of their investment strategies.</p><p>For what it’s worth, <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2024/04/president-bidens-budget-calls-for-raising-43-trillion-in-revenues-over-ten-years-heres-how">those taxes are only applicable for individuals with a net worth of over $100M</a>, with payments at an automatic minimum tax rate treated as prepayments against future realized gains. The effect could actually be to encourage startups to go public and realize their value sooner, which wouldn’t be a terrible thing for the ecosystem (but might limit the heights private valuations can reach). Given that people with that level of worth don’t usually make taxable <em>income</em>, this new levied tax on investment gains makes sense as a way to encourage the very wealthy to pay the same sorts of tax rates as the rest of us — but, clearly, Musk, Thiel, et al feel differently. (Invasive thought: where’s Sacks and Palihapitiya’s podcast co-host Jason Calacanis on this? Is he a sympathizer or just an enabler?)</p><p>Do tighter regulations and a new minimum tax for the wealthy risk the future of America, though? Maybe they have a different definition of America than I do. If, to them, it’s a place where you can make a bunch of money without oversight or accountability, then I can see how they might be upset. If, on the other hand, America is a place where immigrants are welcome and everyone can succeed, and where everyone has the freedom to be themselves, all built on a bedrock of infrastructure and support, then one might choose to take a different view. The tax proposal at hand is hardly socialism; it’s more like a correction. Even if you accept their premise, single-issue voting when the other issues include mass deportations and gutting public education is myopically self-serving, leave alone the barren inhumanity of leaving vulnerable communities out to dry.</p><p>Responses by prominent Republican supporters to the inclusion of a Sikh prayer in Punjabi in the Republican National Convention — one line reading, “in your grace and through your benevolence, we experience peace and happiness” — <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/rnc-delegates-sound-off-on-whether-america-should-be-a-christian-nation/">lay bare what the unhinged Christian nationalist contingent believes in</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Andrew Torba, CEO of the far-right social media platform Gab, ranted to his 400,000 followers on X, “Last night you saw why Christian Nationalism must be exclusively and explicitly Christian. No tolerance for pagan false gods and the synagogue of Satan.” Republican Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers seemed to agree. “Christians in the Republican party nodding silently along to a prayer to a demon god is shameful,” he posted.</p></blockquote><p>From my perspective, there are no upsides to a Trump win. Even if you accept the idea that Project 2025 has nothing to do with him (which, as I’ve discussed, is laughable), his own self-published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_47">Agenda 47</a> for his next administration is similarly horrible, and includes provisions like sending the National Guard into cities, destroying climate crisis mitigations, mass deportations, and removing federal funding for any educational institution that dares to teach the history of race in America. It also includes a version of Project 2025’s call to fire civil servants who are seen as disloyal. JD Vance <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/jd-vance-working-women-moms.html">wants to end no-fault divorce</a>(ironically, given his running mate), trapping people in abusive relationships. The effects on the judicial system from his first administration will be felt for generations; a second administration will be similarly seismic. He will gut support for vulnerable communities. I have friends who will directly suffer as a result of his Presidency; he will create an America that I do not want to bring my son up in.</p><p>Silicon Valley is supposed to invent the future. That’s what’s so inspiring about it: for generations, it’s created new ways of sharing and working that have allowed people to communicate and work together wherever they are. These new moves make it clearer than ever that a portion of it has never believed in that manifesto; that it is there solely to establish itself as a new set of power-brokers, trying to remake the world in their own image. The rest of us need to oppose them with our full voices and everything we can muster.</p></div>

## US says China's halt of arms-control talks undermines strategic stability

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

State Department — The United States called China's decision to suspend nascent arms-control talks with Washington "unfortunate," noting that China has opted not to engage in efforts to manage strategic risks and prevent costly arms races.


“We think this approach undermines strategic stability. It increases the risk of arms race dynamics. We have made efforts to bolster the defense of our allies and partners in the Indo Pacific, and we will continue to make those efforts in the face of Chinese threats to their security,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters during a briefing on Wednesday.


The Chinese foreign ministry announced on Wednesday that Beijing has decided to hold off on discussions with the U.S. regarding a new round of consultations on arms control and non-proliferation. 


This decision is a protest against Washington's arms sales to Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.


“China has chosen to follow Russia's lead in asserting that engagement on arms control can't proceed when there are other challenges in the bilateral relationship,” Miller added.


On November 6, 2023, officials from the U.S. and China convened for a new strategic risk reduction discussion at the State Department. 


Leading the U.S. delegation was Mallory Stewart, assistant secretary for the State Department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability (ADS). The Chinese delegation was headed by Sun Xiaobo, director general for arms control at China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with other civilian officials also in attendance.


The U.S. has proposed three measures to China aimed at reducing strategic risks related to missile launches or potential missile launches. These include establishing a strategic crisis hotline between their respective Strategic Commands, implementing space deconfliction measures, and adopting missile launch notifications, a practice observed by China with Russia.


China's decision to halt the new round of strategic risk reduction talks was described as not a significant loss to the U.S., as Chinese officials did not propose any initiatives during the November discussions, according to a source familiar with the matter.


The source also noted that similar talks between the U.S. and China under previous administrations had yielded no tangible results.


“China stands ready to maintain communication with the U.S. on international arms control issues in line with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Wednesday. 


“But the U.S. must respect China’s core interests and create necessary conditions for dialogue and exchange,” he said.


Some former U.S. intelligence officials doubt the effectiveness of ongoing government-to-government engagements and exchanges. They argue that Beijing's recent suspension of risk reduction talks in response to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan serves as a convenient pretext for China to persist with its internal nuclear arms buildup and external proliferation.


James Fanell, a retired U.S. Navy captain and former director of intelligence and information operations for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, commented that “talks can and will be held when the Chinese Communist Party changes its nefarious actions and destabilizing behavior."


In a report mandated by Congress last October, the Pentagon revealed that China was developing its nuclear arsenal more quickly than the U.S. had previously estimated.


As of May 2023, China had more than 500 operational nuclear warheads, with projections indicating they could exceed 1,000 by 2030.


According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the United States currently has about 3,700 nuclear warheads, fewer than Russia's estimated 4,500.


The U.S. switched its diplomatic recognition from the government in Taipei to the government in Beijing in 1979.


Since then, the U.S. policy has maintained that differences between the two sides should be settled peacefully and in accordance with the will of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The United States acknowledges but has never endorsed Beijing’s sovereignty claim over Taiwan.


Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.

Steelmaking alone accounts for about 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions, so greener production is essential. The GEM report found that 93% of new planned steel capacity will use low-emission electric arc furnaces instead of the much dirtier blast furnace. It projects that the global steelmaking fleet could be very close to meeting the International Energy Agency’s net zero emissions targets by 2030. “The transition to greener steel is afoot,” the report said, but it acknowledged that the blast furnace isn’t going away just yet and remains a climate risk.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

WOODSTOCK, England — Leaders from across Europe expressed support for Ukraine and concern about the direction of the United States on Thursday at a security-focused summit clouded by worries about whether the U.S. will remain a reliable ally if Donald Trump wins a second presidency.


Newly elected U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed some 45 heads of government to an English country mansion to discuss migration, energy security and the threat from Russia as he seeks to restore relations between the U.K. and its European Union neighbors four years after their acrimonious divorce.


The venue for the European Political Community, or EPC, meeting, Blenheim Palace, was the birthplace of Britain's World War II Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Starmer said the leaders were convening "as a new storm gathers over our continent."


"Our first task here today is to confirm our steadfast support for Ukraine, to unite once again behind those values that we cherish and to say we will face down aggression on this continent together," Starmer said, adding that the threat from Russia "reaches right across Europe."


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was a key guest at the meeting, aimed at shoring up Europe's support for his country's defense and discussing ways to defend democracy. The U.K. accuses Moscow of seeking to undermine European democracies with cyberattacks, disinformation and sabotage.




Others making the trip to Blenheim Palace, a Baroque country mansion 100 kilometers (60 miles) northwest of London, included German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stayed away as she fought to secure a second term from lawmakers in the European Parliament, which she received as the summit was underway.


A brainchild of Macron, the EPC was established in 2022 as a forum for countries inside and outside the 27-nation EU after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine shattered Europe's sense of security. The next three summits are due to be held in Hungary, Albania and Denmark.


Starmer's center-left government aims to rebuild ties with the EU strained by years of ill-tempered wrangling over Brexit terms. A key priority is a new U.K.-EU security pact that Starmer hopes to strike soon.


"We are confident that a new chapter will be opened with the U.K.," European Council President Charles Michel said as he arrived.


Starmer said that the U.K. plans to take a more active role on the world stage, especially when it comes to Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion and to people-smuggling gangs organizing irregular migration.


He promised "we will never withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights" — something the previous Conservative U.K. government had flirted with, to the alarm of the U.K.'s European allies.


The U.K. plans to work more closely with the European police agency Europol against people smuggling, part of measures to beef up border security following Starmer's decision to scrap the Conservatives' contentious and unrealized plan to send migrants arriving in the U.K. by boat on a one-way trip to Rwanda.


Starmer called the Rwanda plan a "gimmick" and urged European nations to cooperate against "the vile trade of people smuggling."


"Let's be frank — 'challenge' is the wrong word," he said. "It is now, I think, a crisis. We must combine our resources, share intelligence, share tactics, shut down the smuggling routes and smash the gangs."


At the end of the daylong summit, Starmer said there had been broad agreement on "gripping the migration crisis" but acknowledged it would take time.


"Two weeks ago today we were still knocking on doors asking people to vote for us. We can't turn it around that quickly," he told a news conference.




Many thoughts strayed to the U.S., where the weekend assassination attempt on Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, underscored how febrile and polarized politics has become before the November 5 election.


Trump's skepticism about NATO has long worried U.S. allies. Trump's choice of Senator J.D. Vance, an opponent of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, as his vice presidential running mate has heightened concerns.


Politicians and officials at the summit stressed the need for Europe to show it was taking steps to protect its own security.


"European countries must stand on their own legs more than ever," Netherlands Prime Minister Dick Schoof said.


That sentiment was echoed by several other leaders, but not by Hungary's pro-Russia Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has riled other EU nations with a series of meetings with foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, about Ukraine.

## Should you give up social media?

date: 2024-07-18, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>In a <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/could-you-give-up-social-media">recent post</a>, Kev used the magic words to summon me and make me write something on this site: he talked about social media, mentioned me, and posed a question. Rather than focusing on the could/should/would why don’t we focus on the actual product and figure out what is that we’re getting out of social media? And I’m saying “we” even though I’m not really on any traditional social media platform. But more on that later.</p>
<p>The quality and usefulness of a social platform are a by-product of three factors: my inputs, other people’s inputs, and the platform creator’s intentions. The first two are quite obvious since social media is the product of what people decide to put into it. The third is what really shapes a platform. Not all platforms are created equal and as a result of that the mixture of inputs and outputs can differ widely from one digital place to another. Fame and money are terrible incentives when it comes to digital spaces because people are willing to do pretty much everything to get a following if that can help them earn money. So every time a platform gets big enough you just know things are doomed to turn to shit. That’s an inescapable reality of social platforms. So if you’re looking for a decent social media space you probably want to stay on one that’s designed to either stay small in size or one that’s designed to stay small in scope.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to think that a Mastodon server is a good example of the first type but you’d be wrong. The decentralised social media experiments—Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky—are not designed to stay small. Quite the contrary. They can stay small but you have to fight against the main concept behind those platforms. In the past, I argued that <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/small-communities-are-the-best-communities">small communities are the best type of communities</a> and so one potential solution to this social media conundrum is to find—or create!—a closed-door, small community that wants to stay small on purpose in order to keep it sane.</p>
<p>Another potential solution is to not join a kitchen-sink social platform where (almost) everything goes and instead join one that is specifically designed to cater for a specific audience. <a href="https://literal.club">Literal</a> is a good example. It’s a social platform but the focus is books so everything that’s happening there is related to books and book reading. You won’t find people sharing memes or random links or anything like that but if you care about books you’ll find plenty of those.</p>
<p>Another good example is <a href="https://read.cv/">read.cv</a> and its sibling, <a href="https://posts.cv/">posts.cv</a>. The first one gives out very early Dribbble vibes but with a different overall aesthetic and the second, since it’s tied to the first one, is a Twitter clone where everyone’s a designer posting stuff about design or photography. I have a profile on both so technically I am on social media but my activity on there is non-existent. I update the <a href="https://read.cv/manuelmoreale">read.cv profile</a> periodically since it’s my online CV and I never posted anything on post.cv even though every three or four weeks I scroll through it for 5 minutes to see what people are creating. And it’s an incredibly positive experience. No flame wars, no memes, and nobody is trying to crypto scam anyone. Just a chill place that’s mainly focused on design (and cats).</p>
<p>The main issue with social media is that we want them to be everything. We want them to be a place for casual interactions, for discovery, for news, for serious discourse. And that’s a mistake. Because the moment you put a stupid amount of people in one room and you let them do whatever they want the only reasonable outcome you can expect is chaos. Sure, you might get some positive results out of it but you’ll also likely get someone shitting in a corner and someone trying to fuck the power outlet. Because that’s the world we live in. Now sprinkle some nonsense AI on top of it all and Bob’s your uncle.</p>
<p>So, to circle back to the original question you asked Kev, I don’t think it’s a matter of wanting to give up social media entirely. You should be asking if you’re willing to give up this specific flavour of social media, you should be asking what parts of this type of social media you’re treasuring and then figure out if there are saner ways to get those same things elsewhere.</p>                <hr>

## JD Vance will introduce himself to the nation at the RNC as Trump's running mate

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

MILWAUKEE — Introducing himself to the nation after being tapped as Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance is planning to use his Wednesday night address to the Republican National Convention to share the story of his hardscrabble upbringing and make the case that his party best understands the challenges facing struggling Americans.


The 39-year-old Ohio senator is a relative political unknown. In his first primetime speech since becoming the nominee for vice president, Vance is expected to talk about growing up poor in Kentucky and Ohio, his mother addicted to drugs and his father absent, and how he later went on to the highest levels of U.S. politics.


Vance, who rapidly morphed in recent years from a bitter critic of the former president to an aggressive defender, is positioned to become the future leader of the party and the torch-bearer of Trump's "Make America Great Again" political movement, which has reshaped the Republican Party and broken longtime political norms. The first millennial to join the top of a major party ticket, he enters the race as questions about the age of the men at the top — 78-year-old Trump and 81-year-old Biden — have been high on the list of voters' concerns.


Speaking earlier Wednesday, at his first fundraiser as Trump's running mate, Vance said he will use the speech to highlight the contrast between Trump and Biden.


"The guy who actually connects with working people in this country is not Fake Scranton Joe, it's Real President Donald Trump," he said.


Vance was introduced at the fundraiser by Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, who said Trump's decision to choose Vance wasn't about picking a running mate or the next vice president.


"Donald Trump's decision this week in picking JD Vance was about the future," he said. "Donald Trump picked a man in JD Vance that is the future of the country, the future of the Republican Party, the future of the America First movement."


Along with his relative youth, Vance is new to some of the hallmarks of Republican presidential politics: This year's gathering is the first RNC that Vance has attended, according to a Trump campaign official who was not authorized to speak publicly.


Trump, who entered the arena to a version of the song "It's a Man's World" by James Brown and Luciano Pavarotti, will be watching from his family box.


Convention organizers had stressed a theme of unity, even before Trump survived an attempted assassination at a rally in Pennsylvania Saturday. Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and the subsequent attack on the U.S. Capitol, officials said, would be absent from the stage.


But that changed with former White House official Peter Navarro, who was greeted with enthusiastic cheers and a standing ovation hours after he was released from a Miami prison where he served four months for defying a subpoena from the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of the former president's supporter.


"If they can come for me, if they can come for Donald Trump, be careful. They will come for you," he said in a fiery speech. He compared his legal troubles to those faced by Trump, who earlier this year was convicted on 34 felony charges in his criminal hush money trial. Trump is also facing two indictments for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.


"They did not break me," Navarro said, "and they will never break Donald Trump."


Also spotted on the floor of the convention: Paul Manafort, Trump's 2016 campaign chair, who was convicted as part of the investigation into Russia's meddling in that election.


Vance is an Ivy League graduate and former businessman, but gained prominence following the publication of his bestselling 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy," which tells the story of his blue-collar roots. The book became a must-read for those seeking to understand the cultural forces that propelled Trump to the White House that year.


Still, most Americans — and Republicans — don't know much about Vance. According to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted before Trump selected the freshman senator as his choice, 6 in 10 Americans don't know enough about him to have formed an opinion.


About 2 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of him, and 22% view him negatively. Among Republicans, 61% don't know enough to have an opinion of Vance. About one-quarter have a positive view of him, and roughly 1 in 10 have a negative one.


Vance will be introduced Wednesday night by his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who is a close friend of Vance, will also speak.


Beyond Vance's prime-time speech, the Republican Party focused Wednesday on a theme of American global strength. Speakers were to include family members of service members killed during the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and someone taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack in Israel, according to a person familiar with the program.


Republicans contend that the country has become a "global laughingstock" under Biden's watch. The party that was once home to defense hawks and neoconservatives has fully embraced Trump's "America First" foreign policy that redefined relationships with allies and adversaries.


Democrats have sharply criticized Trump — and Vance — for their positions, including their questioning of U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion.


In a video released Wednesday by Biden's reelection campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris dismissed Vance as someone Trump "knew would be a rubber stamp for his extreme agenda."


"Make no mistake: JD Vance will be loyal only to Trump, not to our country," Harris says in a video.

## US arrests Syrian who oversaw prison where alleged abuse took place

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES  — A former Syrian military official who oversaw a prison where human rights officials say torture and abuse routinely took place has been arrested, authorities said Wednesday.


U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents took Samir Ousman al-Sheikh into custody last week at Los Angeles International Airport, said agency spokesperson Greg Hoegner.


The 72-year-old has been charged with immigration fraud, specifically that he denied on his U.S. visa and citizenship applications that he had ever persecuted anyone in Syria, according to a criminal complaint filed on July 9 and reviewed by The Associated Press. Investigators are considering additional charges against al-Sheikh, the complaint shows.


He was in charge of Syria's infamous Adra Prison from 2005 to 2008 under President Bashar Assad. Human rights groups and United Nations officials have accused the Syrian government of widespread abuses in its detention facilities, including torture and arbitrary detention of thousands of people, in many cases without informing their families about their fate. Many remain missing and are presumed to have died or been executed.


"This is the highest-level Assad regime official arrested anywhere in the world. ... This is a really big deal," said Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based opposition organization.


Moustafa said Wednesday that one of his staff members, a former Syrian detainee, was first tipped off in 2022 by a refugee that there was "potentially a war criminal" in the United States. His organization alerted several federal agencies and began working with them to build a case against al-Sheikh.


Al-Sheikh's attorney, Peter Hardin, called it a "simple misunderstanding of immigration forms" that has been politicized and said al-Sheikh "finds himself being made a pawn caught up in a larger international struggle."


"He vigorously denies these abhorrent accusations," Hardin said.


Investigators interviewed five former inmates at the Syrian prison, who described being hanged by their arms from the ceiling, severely beaten with electrical cables, and witnessing other prisoners being branded by hot rods, according to court documents. One inmate described how guards broke his back.


According to the complaint, al-Sheikh, a resident of Los Angeles since 2020, stated in his citizenship application that he had "never persecuted (either directly or indirectly) any person because of race, religion, national origin, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion" and "never been involved in killing or trying to kill someone." This was false, as al-Sheikh persecuted political dissidents and ordered the execution of prisoners while he was head of Adra, the complaint states.


He began his career working police command posts before transferring to Syria's domestic intelligence agency, which focused on countering political dissent, the complaint says. He later became head of Adra Prison and brigadier general in 2005. He also served for one year as the governor of Deir Ez-Zour, a region northeast of the Syrian capital of Damascus, where there were violent crackdowns against protesters.


He had purchased a one-way plane ticket to depart LAX on July 10, en route to Beirut, Lebanon, which shares a border with Syria, according to the complaint. After his arrest, al-Sheikh made his first appearance in Los Angeles federal court last Friday. He has family in the United States, including a daughter living in the Los Angeles area, according to the Syrian Emergency Task Force.


Syria's civil war, which has left nearly half a million people dead and displaced half the country's prewar population of 23 million, began as peaceful protests against Assad's government in March 2011.


Other players in the war, now in its 14th year, have also been accused of abuse of detainees, including insurgent groups and the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which guard suspected and convicted Islamic State members imprisoned in northeastern Syria.


In May, a French court sentenced three high-ranking Syrian officials in absentia to life in prison for complicity in war crimes in a landmark case against Assad's regime and the first such case in Europe.


The court proceedings came as Assad had begun to shed his longtime status as a pariah because of the violence unleashed on his opponents. Human rights groups involved in the case hoped it would refocus attention on alleged atrocities.
