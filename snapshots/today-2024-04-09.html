<p>A bunch of small but important items in recently-breaking AI news:
Tesla settled their lawsuit with the Huang family over Walter Huang’s
death, for an undisclosed amount of money. “Although Huang’s family
acknowledges he was distracted while the car was driving, they argued
Tesla is at fault because it falsely marketed Autopilot as self-driving
software. They alleged Tesla knew that Autopilot was not ready for prime
time and had flaws that could make its use unsafe.” The settlement is
striking in part because Musk had previously said this</p>

<h2 id="what-climate-change-is-doing-to-our-brains">What Climate Change
Is Doing to Our Brains</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTk1ODQ4NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODk1NzQ3OX0.Nyh6Xc8wB8KIgNICEfMMp8MSSIf3gWF_xo-4JV9SA_4/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Thinking is physical. Thankfully, one of the many wonderful things about
the human brain is that we don’t have to confront this unsettling fact
very much — that the environment around us shapes our perceptions and
reactions, that all human experience is the result of secreted hormones
and synaptic transmission. In other words, our brains let us think we’re
in charge.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, as with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/climate-change-is-breaking-time" target="_self">so
many other things</a>, climate change is interfering. “As the
environment changes, you should expect to change too,” writes author,
neuroscientist, and <em>Grist</em> senior data scientist Clayton Page
Aldern in his gripping new book,
<a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-weight-of-nature-how-a-changing-climate-changes-our-brains-clayton-page-aldern/20435886" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Weight of Nature: How a Changing Climate Changes Our
Brains</em></a><em>. </em>“It is the job of your brain to model the
world as it is,” he goes on. “And the world is mutating.”
</p>
<p>
You may already be familiar with some of his examples — that the heat
can make us
<a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/yale-study-abnormally-hot-days-could-impact-your-cognitive-skills/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dumber</a>
and
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/10/13/heat-hate-speech-aggression-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
aggressive</a>, and that people who survive traumatic weather events can
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/peril-and-promise/2022/02/when-climate-change-becomes-climate-trauma/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">get
post-traumatic stress disorder</a>. But Aldern’s book — which, in spite
of its author’s technical background, is immensely readable and literary
— pushes far past the familiar, touching on topics as wide-ranging as
<a href="https://grist.org/climate-energy/climate-change-could-lead-to-a-rise-in-brain-eating-parasites/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brain-eating
amoebas</a>,
<a href="https://news.yale.edu/2023/05/04/new-database-offers-insight-consequences-language-loss" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">language
death</a>, and free will. The common theme throughout, though, is that
climate is our unseen “puppeteer.”
</p>
<p>
Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You use the phrase “the weight of nature” in several contexts
throughout the book. It made me think of both Altas, as in “the weight
on our shoulders,” and also the idea of determinism that you get into a
bit. At what point in the writing process did you come up with the
title?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It was early on that the title came to me, but it was not the original
title. I’ve been working on this project for six or seven years, and
initially my working title was something awful like <em>Nature’s
Marionette</em>, which sought to communicate this notion of forcing our
hands — the puppetmaster behind our decision-making.
</p>
<p>
But I wanted to be able to communicate this feeling of being guided by
the environment — in addition to carrying said burden — because it felt
like weight. It does feel heavy, and heaviness does a lot of things,
including forcing our hands.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there something about brains that makes them uniquely
vulnerable to climate change? I ask because I’m sure books could be
written about how climate change hurts our hearts or lungs, too. But it
seems to impact our brains in a variety of terrifying forms.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Hearts do one thing: They beat. Brains are always reaching outward, and
so, by extension, they’re enmeshed in the same manner in which one can
imagine our entire bodies to be enmeshed in this “environment.”
</p>
<p>
More specifically, in addition to the reaching-out action, brains are
actively modeling the world around us. That is what they do. This notion
of having an active organ, as opposed to a somewhat passive organ, makes
the difference because brains are always integrating new information
about the world. And the world is changing.
</p>
<p>
As we come to terms with this changing world — and when I use the phrase
“come to terms,” I’m not seeking to deploy some kind of intellectual or
emotional metaphor here. I mean, on a <em>biophysical level</em>, as
we’re coming to terms with these changes — then neurochemical changes
result accordingly. We respond in kind. Certainly, our other organs are
adaptive to various degrees, but the whole point of the brain is its
adaptive nature, right? It seeks to model the world around us, and it
implements change through a system known as neuroplasticity. It is an
organ that is built for modeling and integrating change. And so, is it
any wonder that climate change acts directly on this organ in ways it
may not act on others?
</p>
<p>
<strong>The chapter about Karl Friston and the give-and-take of
perception — in which you write, “our actions are the world’s
sensations, and our sensations are the world’s actions” — completely
blew my mind.</strong>
</p>
<p>
I haven’t even told this to my editor, but I think if I’m ever granted
the privilege of writing a book again, I might try to pitch a biography
of Karl Friston. His research is unbelievably interesting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is his work well-known among neuroscientists, or is it kind of
fringe even within the community?</strong>
</p>
<p>
That’s a fabulous question, and I’ll tell you why: Karl is one of the
most cited neuroscientists of all time, but most neuroscientists have
not heard of him. The reason that paradox is true is because, early in
his career, he developed some of the basic algorithmic technology
underlying functional resonance in functional magnetic resonance
imaging: fMRI. And so, anytime anybody uses fMRI, which most
neuroscientists do, there’s this casual Fristonian citation that goes
back to his early work.
</p>
<p>
Far fewer people have paid attention to his groundbreaking work on
what’s called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_principle#:~:text=By%20actively%20changing%20the%20world,well%20as%20to%20artificial%20intelligence." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">free
energy hypothesis</a>. If you Google, like, “the most influential
neuroscientists of all time,” he’s always on these lists, but nobody
knows who he is. Well, <em>nobody</em> is a stretch; he’s reasonably
well-known in sub-communities. But by and large, he’s such an abstract
thinker, and his material is so difficult to internalize, that most
people who are attracted to his work fall into the neuro-theory
community, computational neuroscientists, theoretical neuroscientists —
and that’s, frankly, the vast minority of neuroscientists. So he is
somewhat of an unknown entity, which is just astounding because he has
literally been in the running for the Nobel.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Something that struck me was how many gaps there are in the
science of understanding our own brains — we often seem to know the
general <em>region</em> where thoughts or impulses originate but not
quite the mechanics of how they work. Are there certain mysteries about
our consciousness and perception that might always remain slightly out
of our reach?</strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s a <em>huge</em> body of research that seeks to address whether
or not the question of consciousness, and understanding it, is
unravelable at all. This is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
hard problem of consciousness</a>. Have we made progress in our
understanding of consciousness over the past 100 or 200 years? Well,
almost certainly, yes. And in neuroscience, we’ve come closer to an
understanding of what perception is and what consciousness is.
</p>
<p>
Will another 20 years or so get us closer to an ultimate, grounded, and
internalized rational scientific representation there of? Maybe! But
there are also people today who argue with just as much empirical
backing that the notion of solving consciousness — the notion of,
basically, a self coming to understand itself — is a logically
impossible act.
</p>
<p>
I’m not a consciousness researcher, so I’m not sure if I have enough
background to really say that I’ve made my mind up. But there are
certainly folks out there who say consciousness is not something that’s
solvable, it’s not something that we will ever understand in the same
materialistic terms that, perhaps, we understand the heart.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I’m going to be obnoxious and ask the AI question. You didn’t
really get into the possibility and pitfalls of technology, but I’m
wondering if it was back of mind at all while you were writing?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I’m going to give you an obnoxious answer. In fact, it’s a decades-old
obnoxious answer. When I’m thinking about this stuff, my instinct is to
think about technology in terms of the manners in which it removes us
from nature. So much of the promise in this area of research — and I do
think there’s promise, I don’t think it’s all doom and gloom — is that
this intimate relationship we have with the planet is also that which
can be leveraged to help mediate some of these detrimental effects.
</p>
<p>
There’s a fabulous book from a couple of years ago,
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780393355574" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Nature Fix,</em> by Florence Williams</a>; I have come to understand my
book as its dark version. <em>The Nature Fix</em> details all the
manners in which interacting with nature, as opposed to the built
environment, is essential for mental, psychological, spiritual, and
neurological health.
</p>
<p>
This is an obnoxious answer because it’s the classic “<em>Oh, kids are
all looking at their phones!</em>” But I think that’s real — the
handheld devices and the omniscience of the all-knowing screen, which,
perhaps we can extend that to the LLMs. As it were, there’s this suite
of technologies that mediates our relationship both with knowledge writ
large and the broader environment outside of ourselves. In my estimate,
it filters the world in a way that I suspect is preventing us from
interacting with some of the benefits that the environment has to offer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The same things that make our brains incredible — their ability
to adapt, create, and use language — are also what allowed us to invent
the combustion engine, organize global commodities markets, and design
machines for fracking. In a sense, the climate fight requires beating
back against the weight and consequences of our own brains,
right?</strong>
</p>
<p>
When I think about this question, it’s less about “how can we ensure
we’re using the tools of evolution, the powers of the brain, for good,”
and more about coming to terms with the fact that something like free
will doesn’t exist.
</p>
<p>
There’s this thinker, Timothy Morton, who writes a lot about our
enmeshment with the environment and the degree to which one cannot
separate the self from the greater universe. Taken to its extreme, that
thinking — which I think is very powerful — implies that what we need to
wrap our heads around and come to terms with is the fact that we’re not
really making decisions, per se. It’s just a universe of particles in
motion. So grappling with what Morton calls
<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780674064225" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
ecological thought</a>, grappling with this notion of determinism and
enmeshment, and trying to suss out the moral responsibilities that fall
out of that relationship — that, to me, is a worthy task and, frankly,
an unsolved problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>As a neuroscientist working in the climate space, what keeps you
up at night?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The 20-year timeline keeps me up at night. A lot of the research that
we’re coming to terms with today is going to make itself known on a much
more visceral level over the next 20 to 50 years. If it is in fact the
case that cyanobacterial blooms are releasing a neurotoxin that is
spurring an increased risk of ALS, that neurodegenerative disease isn’t
necessarily going to manifest in people whom it is likely to affect for
a number of years. We’re not going to see in tangible, visceral terms a
corresponding spike in this disease in the general population for
another couple of decades.
</p>
<p>
I just published
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/everybody-has-a-breaking-point-how-the-climate-crisis-affects-our-brains" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
piece in<em> The Guardian</em></a> about some of these effects, and one
of the researchers I interviewed for that piece basically said what I’m
trying to communicate now, which is: We’re in the midst of a grand
experiment. It’s not like a lab where you’ve got a rat, and you’re
selectively exposing it to one toxin over the course of some fixed time
period and measuring the results. The lab that we’re in is the Earth and
we are exposed to climatic and environmental stressors in this soup,
chronically, for years and years, and in unknown quantities. At some
point, we’re going to look around and say, “Oh, this is really bad. We
should do something about this.” And for many people, it will be too
late.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What gives you hope?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t like hope. I think that hope breeds complacency — or, at least,
false hope does. I tend personally not to look for vectors of hope per
se, which is not to say that I’m a pessimist or a nihilist or anything
like that. I look for climate solutions, for example, or sources of
resilience, or stories of the capacity of the human spirit that inspire
me with a feeling of desire. I’m interested in having images out there
in the world that point my compass toward a future that I would like to
realize.

id="us-top-military-leaders-face-congress-over-pentagon-budget-and-questions-on-israel-ukraine-support">US
top military leaders face Congress over Pentagon budget and questions on
Israel, Ukraine support</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman
Gen. Charles Brown Jr. testified on Capitol Hill on Tuesday about the
Pentagon’s $850 billion budget for 2025 as questions remained as to
whether lawmakers will support current spending needs for Israel or
Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Senate hearing was the first time lawmakers on both sides were
able to question the Pentagon’s top civilian and military leadership on
the administration’s Israel strategy following the country’s deadly
strike on World Central Kitchen humanitarian aid workers in Gaza. It
also follows continued desperate pleas by Ukraine’s president Volodymyr
Zelenskyy that if the U.S. does not help soon, Kyiv will lose the war to
Russia.</p>
<p>In their opening statements, both Austin and Brown emphasized that
their 2025 budget is still shaped with the military’s long-term
strategic goal in mind — to ready forces and weapons for a potential
future conflict with China. About $100 billion of this year’s request is
set aside for new space, nuclear weapons and cyber warfare systems the
military says it must invest in now before Beijing’s capabilities
surpass it.</p>
<p>But the conflicts in Ukraine and Israel are challenging a
deeply-divided Congress and have resulted in months of delays in getting
last year’s defense budget through, which was only passed by lawmakers a
few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Austin’s opening remarks were temporarily interrupted by protesters
lifting a Palestinian flag and shouting at him to stop sending weapons
to Israel. “Stop the genocide,” they said, as they lifted their hands,
stained in red, in the air.</p>
<p>The Pentagon scraped together about $300 million in ammunition to
send to Kyiv in March but cannot send more without Congress’ support,
and a separate $60 billion supplemental bill that would fund those
efforts has been stalled for months.</p>
<p>“The price of U.S. leadership is real. But it is far lower than the
price of U.S. abdication,” Austin told the senators.</p>
<p>If Kyiv falls, it could imperil Ukraine’s Baltic NATO member
neighbors and potentially drag U.S. troops into a prolonged European
war. If millions die in Gaza due to starvation, it could enrage Israel’s
Arab neighbors and lead to a much wider, deadlier Middle East conflict —
one that could also bring harm to U.S. troops and to U.S. relations in
the region for decades.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has urged Congress to support new assistance for Ukraine
for months, to no avail, and has tried to walk a perilous line between
defending its ally Israel and maintaining ties with key regional Arab
partners. Israel’s actions in Gaza have been used as a rallying cry by
factions of Iranian-backed militant groups, including the Houthis in
Yemen and Islamic Resistance groups across Iraq and Syria, to strike at
U.S. interests. Three U.S. service members have already been killed as
drone and missile attacks increased against U.S. bases in the
region.</p>
<p>Six U.S. military ships with personnel and components to build a
humanitarian aid pier are also still en route to Gaza but questions
remain as to how food that arrives at the pier will be safely
distributed inside the devastated territory.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are also seeing demands at home. For months, a handful of
its far-right members have kept Congress from approving additional money
or weapons for Ukraine until domestic needs like curbing the crush of
migrants at the southern U.S. border are addressed. Republican House
Speaker Mike Johnson is already facing a call to oust him as speaker by
Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene because Johnson is trying
to work out a compromise that would move the Ukraine aid forward.</p>
<p>On Israel, the World Central Kitchen strike led to a shift in tone
from President Joe Biden on how Israel must protect civilian life in
Gaza and drove dozens of House Democrats, including former House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi, to call on Biden to halt weapons transfers to Israel.</p>
<p>Half the population of Gaza is starving and on the brink of famine
due to Israel’s tight restrictions on allowing aid trucks through.</p>

Below the fold is the story of how I got a full-time Internet connection
at my apartment 32 years ago next month, and the incredible success of
my first ISP.<br /> <br /> The reason I’m now able to tell this story is
that Tom Jennings, the moving spirit behind the ISP has
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">two</a>
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/">posts</a>
describing the history of The Little Garden, which was the name the ISP
had adopted (from a Chinese restaurant in Palo Alto) when I joined it in
May 1993. Tom’s perspective from the ISP’s point of view contrasts with
my perspective — that of a fairly early customer enhanced by information
via e-mail from John Gilmore and Tim Pozar, who were both involved far
earlier than I.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> Jennings
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">starts
his story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Once upon a time, three little businesses wanted a connection to the
ARPAnet/internet. The year was 1990 or 1991. John Gilmore, John
Romke[y], and Trusted Information Systems (TIS) split the $15K or so it
took to get a leased-line and 3COM Brouters to Alternet, with what today
you’d call fractional T1. An additional 56K leased line and Brouter
brought the ’net up to Gilmore’s house, Toad Hall, in San Francisco.
</blockquote>
The three little businesses were Cygnus Support (John Gilmore), Epilogue
Technology (John Romkey) and Trusted Information Systems (Steve
Crocker). AlterNet was run by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Adams_(Internet_pioneer)">Rick
Adams</a>, whom Wikipedia justly describes as an “Internet pioneer”. He
founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUNET">UUNET
Technologies</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the mid-1990s, UUNET was the fastest-growing ISP, outpacing MCI and
Sprint. At its peak, Internet traffic was briefly doubling every few
months, which translates to 10x growth each year.
</blockquote>
<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_(activist)">John
Gilmore</a>, a truly wonderful person, had many friends. So
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">what
happened was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As time went on, friends of theirs wanted in on this rare and exciting
’net connection, resulting in Tim Pozar putting an old PC running Phil
Karn’s KA9Q/NOS program, an amateur radio router capable of TCP/IP, onto
Toad Hall’s ethernet. Tim installed a pair of modems, then dialed in
once and stayed connected 24 hrs/day (Pacific Bell never said you
couldn’t do that…)
</blockquote>
Once Tim showed that it was possible, this
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">idea
took off</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Eventually the NOS box was full, and more friends wanted in, but
everyone was too busy to deal with the hassle.<br /> <br /> Somehow, in
September 1992, Pozar and Gilmore and I worked out a deal where, I would
maintain the thing, collect money to build more NOS boxes and contribute
to the monthly Alternet bill, install more people, and get (1) a free
connection to the internet and (2) a slice off the top after it exceeded
N connections.<br /> <br /> By that December, there were enough
connections in place that I was pocketing $420/month. By March 1993
there were 11 modem-connected members (as we fancied ourselves).
</blockquote>
In 1989 Gilmore had co-founded
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_Solutions">Cygnus
Support</a>, whose tagline was “Making free software affordable”. TLG
got started in August 1990 with the three businesses’ nodes on a 56K
leased line. One was at Cygnus first office in an apartment complex on
University Avenue in Palo Alto. Gilmore and other Cygnus employees had
apartments there, so they used
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2">10BASE2</a> coaxial
cable Ethernet to distribute the Internet around the complex. Gilmore
notes that they used “nonstandard thin 50-ohm coax in the expansion
joints across the driveways when needed”. Pozar notes that they paved
over the coax!<br /> <br /> Gilmore was paying more than $300/mo for
modem phone lines supporting the Alt Usenet groups, and realized that
for less than that he could have a 56K line from Cygnus to his basement
in SF. That led to Pozar and Rich Morin’s Canta Forda Computer
installing the old PC and becoming the first to use the permanent local
call idea.<br /> <br /> I knew Gilmore from the early days of Sun
Microsystems (he was employee #5), so I first found out about the Point
of Presence (PoP) in his basement in late 1992 and <i>really</i> wanted
to join in. Alas, there was a snag — the reason the idea worked was that
local phone calls were free. From my home in Palo Alto to Toad Hall was
a toll call, making it impossibly expensive. But in May 1993 I found out
about the PoP on University, 8 blocks from my apartment.<br /> <br /> I
purchased:<br />
<ul>
<li>
A phone line from Pacific Bell at the PoP.
</li>
<li>
A second phone line at my apartment.
</li>
<li>
A pair of Zyxel 9.6Kb modems, one for the PoP and one for my apartment.
</li>
</ul>

If memory serves, it cost $250 installation fee and $70/month, and Tom
Jennings helped me plug in one of the modems at the University PoP. I
already had two SparcStations, a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation#Integrated_monitor/portable_systems">SparcStation
SLC</a> with an external SCSI hard disk I bought on Sun’s employee
purchase program, and a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARCstation_1">SparcStation
1+</a>, the prizes Steve Kleiman and I won in an internal “Vision Quest”
at Sun. My apartment was open-plan and the 1+’s fans were too noisy to
let me sleep, but the SLC was fanless and could be on-line continuously.
The SLC, the hard disk and the modem sat on a conveniently large window
ledge. There was a wired Ethernet connection from the window ledge to
the desk. When I say “wired” I mean that it ran on the apartments
internal phone wires, but the distance was short enough that it
worked.<br /> <br />

This setup was remarkably reliable. If the call dropped, the SunOS
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1055">SLIP</a>
software automatically re-dialled it. I have no memory of problems with
it; I think the only times it was down were when I upgraded the modems
as faster ones became available, or when I put the whole system on an
Uninterruptible Power Supply. It may have been then that I noticed it
had been up over 500 days. I didn’t really need the UPS, Palo Alto’s
municipal utilities are also very reliable.<br /> <br /> As I recall it
ran happily until I passed the apartment on to my step-daughter’s family
in summer 2000. Seven years of impeccable service. By that time I was
working on the LOCKSS program at Stanford, and we had DSL service from
Stanford IT. So I went from an ISP with great tech support to an ISP
with great support. Then as I relate in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/01/isp-monopolies.html"><i>ISP
Monopolies</i></a> in September 2001
<a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/morgue/2001/2001_09_28.ftth28.html">Palo
Alto’s Fiber-to-the-Home trial</a> went live and I had 10Mbit
bi-directional fiber with great support from Palo Alto Utilities. Since
the trial ended our ISP has been
<a href="https://www.sonic.com/">Sonic</a>, first over 3/1Mbit DSL and
now over
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2021/01/isp-monopolies.html">gigabit
fiber</a>. So we are really used to having great support from our
ISP.<br /> <br /> TLG was an astonishing success. From something like
$2000/month in December 1992 it grew
“<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">an
average of 12% per month from Jan94 through July96</a>” when it had
“<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">a
monthly gross of about $125,000.00</a> until:<br />
<blockquote>
Luckily we were bought by Best Internet Communications, Mountain View;
they had money, marketing, and a non-burned-out management; we had a
solid locked-in customer base and positive cash flow.
</blockquote>
Best turned out to be a pretty good ISP too.<br /> <br /> Jennings’
explanations for TLG’s success are interesting. First,
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">technical
competence</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Edgar Nielsen almost single-handedly built the technical infrastructure
that TLGnet ran on. He designed much of the network and routing
structure, all of the security (with some help from Stu Grossman), wrote
a complete, queryable, shared and remotely-accessible database (included
every single modem, router, wire, cable, customer, IP (domain names and
IP address allocations), and logical link) in standard and portable
tools, installed equipment, built and maintained our unix boxes, put
SNMP on every single node (hundreds) and automated the entire ISP
technical infrastructure from one end to the other. I doubt many small
to mid-size ISPs today have the things Edgar wrote by 1995.
</blockquote>
Second,
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">good
HR</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Another thing of crucial importance to me, and to Deke, Edgar and a
lesser extent Gilmore, was hiring from our local communities; we hired
principled people, punk and queer writers and organizers, and trained
and paid them – pay in scale with effort. Total staff turn-over in three
years was probably 20; peak staff was 12. Some 10 of them started out at
$8.00/hr, unskilled, ended up with $30,000 salary a year later
[1994-1996], and stayed in the industry (at prevailing pay). (And we
provided health insurance too. Deke being damned Wobbly may have had
some small effect.)<br /> …<br /> we treated our staff well, gave them
credit for work done, paid them actual money, gave raises and bonuses
(upon sale of the business, even some fired employees got small bonus
checks). TLGnet wouldn’t have existed without its talented staff!
</blockquote>
Third, an innovative business model starting with their
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">terms
and conditions</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
TLGnet exercises no control whatsoever over the content of the
information passing through TLGnet. You are free to communicate
commercial, noncommercial, personal, questionable, obnoxious, annoying,
or any other kind of information, misinformation, or disinformation
through our service. You are fully responsible for the privacy of,
content of, and liability for your own communications.
</blockquote>
Jennings explains the
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/">business
model</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Concentrate on bulk, fulltime internet access (leased-line and Frame
Relay)
</li>
<li>
Keep prices low by providing connectivity only
</li>
<li>
Unrestricted use of TLG connectivity
</li>
<li>
Encourage resale and vertical-market services
</li>
<li>
Full, up-front disclosure of all pricing
</li>
<li>
No lock-in contracts
</li>
<li>
Unbundle installation costs and eliminate padding
</li>
<li>
Full technical disclosure of technical information
</li>
</ul>
Essentially, other ISPs restricted use and resale of their connections,
in a sort of zero-sum approach. By concentrating on bulk connectivity we
at once created a market for our customers to provide the vertical
services we didn’t want or couldn’t afford to provide, and built a
hard-to-beat solid rep that for a long while locked out direct
competitors to our core business; having our prices online and breaking
down the leased-line costs and equipment gave us a major one-up
economically, technically, and in credible reputation over nearly all
other ISPs, big or small.
</blockquote>
The
<a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/TLG/TLG.html">result
was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Some thought us insane; but in fact our customers didn’t “compete” with
us, they provided vertical services we couldn’t or wouldn’t (I guess we
did have a business plan). And in fact we set further standards of
behavior and policies that other ISPs, including MCI and SprintLink,
were obliged to match. Though some, like Alternet and PSI, never did;
they skimmed the high-end deep-pockets customers, and we got all the new
growth.
</blockquote>
Gilmore writes:<br />
<blockquote>
I would add to the “Busines Model” discussion, that communication costs
per-bit dropped dramatically with volume. When you upgraded from 56k
bit/sec leased lines to T1 (1,500k bit/sec), you got 24x the bandwidth
but it only cost about 4x as much. An upgrade to T3 (45 megabit)
provided 30x the bandwidth of a T1, and didn’t cost anything near to 30x
as much. So, as your traffic volume grew because you were adding more
and more customers, the cost of your basic connection to the rest of the
Internet got significantly cheaper (per bit). That economy of scale
meant that ISPs who grew could keep affording to upgrade their backbones
to handle the traffic growth. Every ISP knew, or figured out, this
economics, and they all depended on it. Remember, this was back when
there were 2000 ISP’s in the US, mostly local ones. (About 30 of them
were getting their Internet service from TLG when we sold it to Best.)
</blockquote>
There is a fascinating October 29 1996 interview entitled
<a href="https://archive.org/details/BrewsterKahleOnWAISAndTheStartOfTheInternetArchive1996"><i>Tim
Pozar and Brewster Kahle CHM Interview</i></a> by Marc Weber. The first
part of the interview is all about TLG. In it Brewster Kahle sums up the
story (I cleaned up his stream of conciousness a bit):<br />
<blockquote>
it took six months of a full-time person to get us on the DARPA net in
1985 … but The Little Garden basically made it so that any old person
[could connect] and more than that not just themselves but … enabling
other people to create their own ISPs and I don’t know there are 400
ISPs now in the Bay Area in large part because of The Little Garden.

Ultra-fast Electron Measurements in Multiple Directions to Reveal the
Secrets of the Aurora</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: NASA breaking news</p>
<p>The energetic electrons that drive the aurora borealis (the northern
lights) have a rich and very dynamic structure that we currently do not
fully understand.  Much of what we know about these electrons comes from
instruments that have fundamental limitations in their ability to sample
multiple energies with high time resolution. To overcome these
limitations, NASA is using an innovative approach to develop
instrumentation that will enhance our measurement capabilities by more
than an order of magnitude—revealing a wealth of new information about
the amazing physics happening within the aurora.</p>

<p>
The Board finds that this intrusion was preventable and should never
have occurred. The Board also concludes that Microsoft’s security
culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul, particularly in light
of the company’s centrality in the technology ecosystem and the level of
trust customers place in the company to protect their data and

The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the
Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.
</p>
<p>
The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane,
Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like
sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the
<a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible,
too.
</p>
<p>
With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We
went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in
2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to
the Maledivez.

bad weather.

the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10
before we left.

<h2 id="ten-years-ago-windows-xp-received-its-final-update">Ten years
ago, Windows XP received its final update</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Exactly ten years ago, on April 8, 2014, Microsoft released the final
security patch for Windows XP. The day marked the end of the road for
one of the most iconic Windows versions ever released. ↫ Taras Buria at
Neowin I never liked Windows XP. Compared to the operating systems I was
using at the time – BeOS, Mandrake Linux 8.x – Windows XP felt kind of
like a bad joke I wasn’t in on. It looked ridiculous, didn’t seem to
offer anything substantial, and it didn’t take long for major security
incidents related to Windows XP to start dominating the news. It wasn’t
until several service packs had been released that Windows XP came into
its own, but by that point, I had already found a much better
alternative for my Windows needs at the time. I’m of course talking
about Windows Server 2003, the better Windows than Windows XP. Today
though, I do have an odd fondness for Windows XP, as I grow older and XP
has become something from my teenage years. The look and feel of Windows
XP – the classic theme, not that horrendous Fisher Price nonsense – the
sound set, the wallpaper of course – has become iconic, warts and all,
and whole generations of people will feel instant feelings as soon as
they see Bliss or hear that iconic startup sound. Windows XP with a few
service packs now belongs to the small group of Windows releases that I
would call the peak of the platform, together with Windows 95 and
Windows 7 (and perhaps Server 2003, but that’s more of a personal thing
and not a consumer operating system). Everything else has not exactly
been great or even aged well, and I doubt Windows 10 and 11 will
suddenly get good, either.</p>

launches Axion processors, new Arm-based CPUs for the data centre</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Built using the Arm Neoverse™ V2 CPU, Axion processors deliver giant
leaps in performance for general-purpose workloads like web and app
servers, containerized microservices, open-source databases, in-memory
caches, data analytics engines, media processing, CPU-based AI training
and inferencing, and more. Axion is underpinned by Titanium, a system of
purpose-built custom silicon microcontrollers and tiered scale-out
offloads. Titanium offloads take care of platform operations like
networking and security, so Axion processors have more capacity and
improved performance for customer workloads. Titanium also offloads
storage I/O processing to Hyperdisk, our new block storage service that
decouples performance from instance size and that can be dynamically
provisioned in real time. ↫ Amin Vahdat on the Google blog Fancy new ARM
processors from Google, designed explicitly for the data centre. In
other words, we’ll never get to play with it unless one makes its way to
eBay in a few years.</p>

Fahrenheit, which is about 3 degrees warmer than the pre-industrial
March average. Over the last 12 months, global temperatures have been
1.58 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial averages, above the 1.5

<li>European court says government inaction on climate change threatens
human rights
</h3>
<p>
The European Court of Human Rights handed down a landmark decision this
morning that could ramp up legal pressure on governments to do more to
limit global warming. The lawsuit was brought by a group of more than
2,000 older Swiss women who argued Switzerland had violated their human
rights by failing to do its part to stop climate change. Older women are
more likely to die from extreme heat, and the group said they suffer
severely during Swiss heatwaves. The court agreed with them, saying
Switzerland hadn’t done enough to meet its emissions reduction targets.
The verdict “opens up all 46 members of the Council of Europe to similar
cases in national courts that they are likely to lose,”

The study estimates the ice surface contains between 300,000 and 850,000
meteorites waiting to be collected, but says 24% of them will be lost by
2050 under current warming conditions, and for every tenth of a degree
of increase in global air temperature, an average of nearly 9,000
meteorites will disappear. “The loss of Antarctic meteorites is much
like the loss of data that scientists glean from ice cores collected
from vanishing glaciers,” said Harry Zekollari, a co-author on the
study. “Once they disappear, so do some of the secrets of the universe.”

engine in Qt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>I’ve been talking about Servo, the Rust browser engine project
originally started at Mozilla, for a while now, and while the project’s
still got a long way to go, it’s definitely a serious contender to
become a competitive browser engine in the future. It seems it’s
starting to get some traction already, as The KDAB Group is working on
bringing Servo to Qt. At KDAB we managed to embed the Servo web engine
inside Qt, by using our CXX-Qt library as a bridge between Rust and C++.
This means that we can now use Servo as an alternative to Chromium for
webviews in Qt applications. ↫ Andrew Hayzen and Magnus Groß They’re
already showing off a basic QML application rendering websites using
Servo, which is pretty cool. It goes to show that Servo can definitely
eventually fulfill the role that Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko fulfill
now.</p>

id="biden-trump-hold-different-views-on-key-domestic-policy-issues">Biden,
Trump hold different views on key domestic policy issues</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s 2024
presidential nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican
Party’s presumptive nominee, hold very different views on key foreign
and domestic issues. Here’s an overview of where each nominee stands on
domestic policy.</p>
<p>Reproductive rights</p>
<p>Biden: The Biden administration has protected access to abortion,
including: FDA-approved medication abortion; defended access to
emergency medical care; supported the ability to travel for reproductive
health care; strengthened access to high-quality, affordable
contraception; safeguarded the privacy of patients and health care
providers and ensured access to accurate information and legal
resources, according to a March 7, 2024 White House fact sheet.</p>
<p>On March 26, 2024, Biden said, “If America sends me a Congress that
are Democrats, I promise you, Kamala and I will restore Roe vs. Wade is
the law of the land again.” He also warned on March 8, 2024, that
“states are passing bans criminalizing doctors, forcing rape and incest
victims to leave their state to get care. And now MAGA Republicans and
Donald Trump want to pass a national ban on the right to choose, period.
Well. Take it seriously, folks, because that’s what they’re heading for.
Hear me loud and clear. This will not happen on my watch.”</p>
<p>Trump: Trump’s three Supreme Court nominees during his presidency
shifted the balance of the court, resulting in an overturning of Roe
vs. Wade, sending the decision to legalize abortion back to the
states.</p>
<p>Trump announced on April 8, 2024, that he believed abortion
legislation should be left up to each state. Previously, he suggested a
nationwide ban on abortion after 15 weeks, saying, “Fifteen weeks seems
to be a number that people are agreeing at.”</p>
<p>Economy</p>
<p>Biden: In a December 5, 2023, speech in Boston, Biden said the
economy had created 14 million new jobs — more jobs than any president
has created in a four-year term; record economic growth — over 5% just
the last quarter; unemployment under 4% for 20 months in a row, and the
lowest inflation rate of any of the world’s major economies. Biden
signed the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act, which authorized $550 billion in new spending.</p>
<p>Trump: According to his campaign website, during his presidency,
“President Donald J. Trump passed record-setting tax relief for the
middle class, doubled the child tax credit, and slashed more job-killing
regulations than any administration had ever done before. Real wages
quickly increased as a result, and median household income reached the
highest level in the history of our country, while poverty reached a
record low.”</p>
<p>Immigration/border security</p>
<p>Biden: President Biden supported the bipartisan Senate Border
Security Act that would have provided billions of dollars in additional
funding for security and enabled him to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border
if daily and weekly border encounters surpassed certain metrics. Former
President Trump pressured Republican lawmakers to reject the border
security deal, resulting in its failure to pass in the U.S. Congress. On
March 9, 2024, Biden said, “On my first day in office as president, I
introduced a comprehensive, comprehensive plan to fix our immigration
system, secure our border, provide a pathway for citizenship for
dreamers and their families, farmworkers, essential workers who helped
us through the pandemic and are part of the fabric of our
community.”</p>
<p>Trump: On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump has pledged to conduct
the largest deportation in U.S. history, shift “massive portions of
federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement” and terminate the
visas of Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.</p>
<p>On his campaign website, Trump said that in cooperative states, he
will deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement to assist
with rapidly removing illegal alien gang members and criminals. He also
pledged to deliver a merit-based immigration system that protects
American labor and promotes American values.</p>
<p>During his presidency, Trump issued an executive order suspending
entry into the United States for everyone from Iraq, Libya, Syria and
Yemen for 90 days and indefinitely for Syrian refugees. He began
construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Criminal justice</p>
<p>Biden: In multiple executive orders, the president has directed the
Justice Department not to renew contracts with privately operated
criminal detention facilities; directed billions of dollars in public
funds to community safety initiatives; and expanded community grants to
keep guns off the streets.</p>
<p>During his State of the Union speech on March 7, 2024, Biden said,
“I’m demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.
Pass universal background checks. None of this. None of this. I taught
the Second Amendment for 12 years. None of this violates the Second
Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.”</p>
<p>Trump: During his presidency, Trump launched Operation Legend to
combat a surge of violent crime in cities, resulting in more than 5,500
arrests and signed the Safe Policing for Safe Communities executive
order to incentivize local police department reforms in line with law
and order.</p>
<p>The former president made hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of
surplus military equipment available to local law enforcement, signed an
executive order to help prevent violence against law enforcement
officers and signed the bipartisan First Step Act into law, the first
landmark criminal justice reform legislation ever passed to reduce
recidivism and help former inmates successfully rejoin society.</p>
<p>On the campaign trail this year, Trump has made the case he will
combat crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>“I do great with the suburban housewives because they want to remain
safe. But they [undocumented immigrants] loot the jewelry, they take
their purses, electronics, watches, all of their cash. And the people
come back and they say, what happened? If you don’t want illegal alien
criminals crawling through your windows and ransacking your drawers,
then you must vote for the fact that we have to throw Crooked Joe Biden
out as fast as possible,” he said on April 2, 2024.</p>
<p>Climate/energy production</p>
<p>Biden: The Democratic president rejoined the Paris climate agreement
and signed the Inflation Reduction Act, investing hundreds of billions
of dollars in clean energy, electric vehicles and environmental justice.
His administration also met goals of cutting emissions by at least 50%
by 2030 and was among the leaders who launched the Global Methane
Pledge, tackling super polluters.</p>
<p>Trump: During his presidency, Trump pulled out of the Paris climate
agreement and claimed that Earth’s temperatures “will start getting
cooler.” Trump appointees dismantled fossil fuel agreements, kept
coal-burning power plants open and launched an anti-trust probe of
automakers who agreed to clean air standards.</p>
<p>“President Trump will unleash the production of domestic energy
resources, reduce the soaring price of gasoline, diesel and natural gas,
promote energy security for our friends around the world, eliminate the
socialist Green New Deal and ensure the United States is never again at
the mercy of a foreign supplier of energy,” according to his campaign
website.</p>

envoy to UN to visit Korean border, North Korean defectors</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea — The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations will
travel to the heavily armed Korean border and meet North Korean
defectors in South Korea, her office said on Monday, amid faltering U.N.
efforts to ensure sanctions enforcement against the North.</p>
<p>Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield’s trip, set for April 14-20, came
after Russia rejected the annual renewal of the multinational panel of
experts, which has over the past 15 years worked on the implementation
of U.N. sanctions aimed at curbing North Korea’s nuclear and missile
programs.</p>
<p>Washington, Seoul and Tokyo criticized Moscow’s veto and China’s
abstention, which experts said would undermine the sanctions
enforcement, with a South Korean envoy likening it to “destroying a CCTV
to avoid being caught red-handed.”</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield’s trip, which will also include a stop in Japan,
was meant to advance bilateral and trilateral cooperation on the
sanctions and beyond, U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson Nate Evans
said.</p>
<p>Both South Korea and Japan are currently members of the Security
Council.</p>
<p>“In both countries, Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield will discuss next
steps to ensure a continuation of independent and accurate reporting of
the DPRK’s ongoing weapons proliferation and sanctions evasion
activities,” Evans said in a statement, referring to North Korea by its
official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>In South Korea, Thomas-Greenfield will travel to the heavily
fortified Demilitarized Zone between the two Koreas, meet young North
Korean defectors as well as students at Ewha Womans University, Evans
said.</p>
<p>In Japan, she will also meet family members of Japanese citizens who
were abducted in the early 2000s by North Korea, and visit Nagasaki,
which was hit by U.S. nuclear bombing in 1945.</p>

id="report-us-must-enhance-critical-minerals-strategy-in-africa">Report:
US must enhance critical minerals strategy in Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — The United States must refine its Africa policy
with a focus on critical minerals, including boosting its diplomatic and
commercial presence in African mining hubs, says a report from the
Washington-based United States Institute of Peace, or USIP.</p>
<p>The group says the changes are needed to safeguard against export
controls and market manipulation by geopolitical competitors.</p>
<p>The United States heavily relies on imports for many critical
minerals for use in electric vehicle batteries and other applications
such as cobalt, graphite and manganese.</p>
<p>“Especially concerning is that the United States is at or near 100%
reliant on ‘foreign entities of concern’ — mainly the People’s Republic
of China — for key critical minerals,” says the USIP report.</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of the Biden administration and Congress to
support U.S. firms in African markets, progress remains measured, with
no sign that China and Gulf State competitors are retreating. The USIP
report recommends the U.S. government invests in “commercial diplomacy”
in Africa.</p>
<p>For example, Washington should prioritize to fully realize the
potential benefits of a memorandum of understanding signed with the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Zambia, following the U.S.-Africa
Leaders Summit in December 2022 to jointly develop a supply chain for
electric vehicle batteries.</p>
<p>The DRC produces more than 70% of the world’s cobalt, while Zambia is
the world’s sixth-largest copper producer and the second-largest cobalt
producer in Africa.</p>
<p>The USIP report also recommends that the U.S. increase the physical
presence of diplomatic and commercial officers in mining centers. Given
the proximity of the Congolese city of Lubumbashi to critical minerals,
and the high priority placed on the country’s Lobito Corridor, USIP
suggests reopening a U.S. consulate in Lubumbashi, provided security
levels are acceptable.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the United States closed its consulate in
Lubumbashi following the end of the Cold War and the redirection of
interests and resources. Lubumbashi is the capital of the mineral-rich
Katanga Province and the second-largest city in the DRC.</p>
<p>Gécamines, the Congolese state mining company, is headquartered in
the city, as are other mining companies.</p>
<p>Other policy recommendations include prioritizing and leveraging
existing U.S. Agency for International Development programs to assist
Africans with rule-of-law and fiscal transparency efforts, expanding
membership of the Minerals Security Partnership to include African
partners, as well as assisting African nations in building technical
capacity in the mining sector.</p>
<p>Launched in June 2022, the Minerals Security Partnership, or MSP, is
a collaboration of 14 countries and the European Union to catalyze
public and private investment in responsible critical minerals supply
chains globally.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say MSP members represent more than 50% of global
gross domestic product and currently run 23 projects that involve the
extraction and processing of cobalt, copper, gallium, germanium,
graphite, lithium, manganese, nickel and rare earth elements. </p>
<p>“We need to scale up our critical mineral supply chains to deploy
clean technologies more quickly, more effectively,” U.S. Secretary of
State Antony Blinken told an MSP forum in Leuven, Belgium, earlier this
month. “The demand is rising. By 2040, demand for lithium is expected to
grow by more than 40%. Graphite, cobalt, nickel demand is set to grow 20
to 25 times.”</p>

<h2
id="from-overcapacity-to-tiktok-issues-covered-during-janet-yellens-trip-to-china">From
overcapacity to TikTok, issues covered during Janet Yellen’s trip to
China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Beijing — U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and her team are
leaving China and returning to Washington after trying to tackle the
major questions of the day between the countries. Here’s a look at what
she tried to accomplish, what was achieved, and where things stand for
the world’s two largest economies:</p>
<p>Unfair trade practices</p>
<p>Yellen said she wanted to go into the U.S.-China talks to address a
major Biden administration complaint that Beijing’s economic model and
trade practices put American companies and workers at an unfair
competitive disadvantage by producing highly subsidized solar products,
electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries at a loss, dominating the
global market.</p>
<p>Chinese government subsidies and other policy support have encouraged
solar panel and EV makers in China to invest in factories, building far
more production capacity than the domestic market can absorb. She calls
this overcapacity.</p>
<p>Throughout the week of meetings, she talked about the risks that come
from one nation maintaining nearly all production capacity in these
industries, the threat it poses to other nations’ industries and how a
massive rapid increase in exports from one country can have big impacts
on the global economy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the two sides agreed to hold “intensive exchanges” on
more balanced economic growth, according to a U.S. statement issued
after Yellen and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng held extended meetings
over two days in the southern city of Guangzhou. It was not immediately
clear when and where the talks would take place.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to be solved in an afternoon or a month, but I think
they have heard that this is an important issue to us,” she said.</p>
<p>Money laundering, related crimes</p>
<p>After several rounds of meetings, the U.S. Treasury and the Chinese
central bank agreed to work together to stop money laundering in their
respective financial systems.</p>
<p>Nearly all the precursor chemicals that are needed to make the deadly
substance fentanyl are coming from China into the U.S. The U.S. says
exchanging information on money laundering related to fentanyl
trafficking may help disrupt the flow of the precursor chemicals into
Mexico and the U.S.</p>
<p>“Treasury is committed to using all of our tools, including
international cooperation, to counter this threat,” Yellen said in a
speech announcing the formation of the group.</p>
<p>The new cooperative between the U.S. and China will be part of the
two nations’ economic working groups that were launched last September,
and the first exchange will be held in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>TikTok</p>
<p>Efforts in the U.S. to ban social media app TikTok, owned by Chinese
parent company ByteDance, were raised initially by the Chinese during
U.S-China talks, a senior Treasury official told The Associated Press.
The firm has in the past promoted a data security restructuring plan
called “Project Texas” that it says sufficiently guards against national
security concerns.</p>
<p>However, U.S. lawmakers have moved forward with efforts to either ban
the app or force the Chinese firm to divest its interest in the company,
which the White House has supported. In China this week, it was evident
that there was little movement on the issue.</p>
<p>Yellen said at a news conference Monday that she supported the
administration’s efforts to address national security issues that relate
to sensitive personal data. “This is a legitimate concern,” she
said.</p>
<p>“Many U.S. social apps are not allowed to operate in China,” Yellen
said. “We would like to find a way forward.”</p>
<p>Financial stability</p>
<p>On the second day of Yellen’s trip to China, the U.S. and China
announced an agreement to work closely on issues related to financial
stability, in that U.S. and Chinese financial regulators agreed to hold
a series of exercises simulating a failure of a large bank in either of
the two countries.</p>
<p>The aim is to determine how to coordinate if a bank failure occurs,
with the intent of preventing catastrophic stress on the global
financial system.</p>
<p>Yellen said several exercises have already happened.</p>
<p>“I’m pleased that we will hold upcoming exchanges on operational
resilience in the financial sector and on financial stability
implications from the insurance sector’s exposure to climate risks.</p>
<p>“Just like military leaders need a hotline in a crisis,” Yellen said
“American and Chinese financial regulators must be able to communicate
to prevent financial stresses from turning into crises with tremendous
ramifications for our citizens and the international community.”</p>
<p>What she ate</p>
<p>Yellen is something of a foodie celebrity in China ever since she ate
mushrooms that can have psychedelic effects in Beijing last July. This
trip was no different.</p>
<p>High-ranking Chinese officials brought up her celebrity ahead of
important meetings — Premier Li Qiang noted in his opening remarks that
Yellen’s visit has “indeed drawn a lot of attention in society” with
media covering her trip and her dining habits. And social media was
abuzz, following her latest movements around Guangzhou and Beijing.</p>
<p>This time in Beijing, Yellen ate at Lao Chuan Ban, a popular Sichuan
restaurant. She also had lunch with Beijing Mayor Yin Yong at the
Beijing International Hotel. On Monday evening, her last night in China,
Yellen visited Jing-A Brewing Co. in Beijing — co-founded by an American
— where she ordered a Flying Fist IPA, a beer made with American
hops.</p>

id="with-6.6b-to-arizona-hub-biden-touts-big-steps-in-us-chipmaking">With
$6.6B to Arizona hub, Biden touts big steps in US chipmaking</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington; Flagstaff, Arizona — President Joe Biden on Monday
announced a $6.6 billion grant to Taiwan’s top chip manufacturer to
produce semiconductors in the southwestern U.S. state of Arizona, which
includes a third facility that will bring the foreign tech giant’s
investment in the state to $65 billion.</p>
<p>Biden said the move aims to perk up a decades-old slump in American
chip manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC),
which is based in the Chinese-claimed island, claims more than half of
the global market share in chip manufacturing.</p>
<p>The new facility, Biden said, will put the U.S. on track to produce
20% of the world’s leading-edge semiconductors by 2030.</p>
<p>“I was determined to turn that around, and thanks to my CHIPS and
Science Act — a key part of my Investing in America agenda —
semiconductor manufacturing and jobs are making a comeback,” Biden said
in a statement.</p>
<p>U.S. production of this American-born technology has fallen steeply
in recent decades, said Andy Wang, dean of engineering at Northern
Arizona University.</p>
<p>“As a nation, we used to produce 40% of microchips for the whole
world,” he told VOA. “Now, we produce less than 10%.”</p>
<p>A single semiconductor transistor is smaller than a grain of sand.
But billions of them, packed neatly together, can connect the world
through a mobile phone, control sophisticated weapons of war and
satellites that orbit the Earth, and someday may even drive a car.</p>
<p>The immense value of these tiny chips has fueled fierce competition
between the U.S. and China.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Commerce has taken several steps to hamper
China’s efforts to build its own chip industry. Those include export
controls and new rules to prevent “foreign countries of concern” — which
it said includes China, Iran, North Korea and Russia — from benefiting
from funding from the CHIPS and Science Act.</p>
<p>While analysts are divided over whether Taiwan’s dominance of this
critical industry makes it more or less vulnerable to Chinese
aggression, they agree it confers the island significant global
status.</p>
<p>“It is debatable what, if any, role Taiwan’s semiconductor
manufacturing prowess plays in deterrence,” said David Sacks, an analyst
who focuses on U.S.-China relations at the Council on Foreign Relations.
“What is not debatable is how devastating an attack on Taiwan would be
for the global economy.”</p>
<p>Biden did not mention U.S. adversaries in his statement, but he noted
the impact of Monday’s announcement, saying it “represent(s) a broader
story for semiconductor manufacturing that’s made in America and with
the strong support of America’s leading technology firms to build the
products we rely on every day.”</p>
<p>VOA met with engineers in the new technological hub state, who said
the legislation addresses a key weakness in American chip
manufacturing.</p>
<p>“We’ve just gotten in the cycle of the last 15 to 20 years, where
innovation has slowed down,” said Todd Achilles, who teaches innovation,
strategy and policy analysis at the University of California-Berkeley.
“It’s all about financial results, investor payouts and stock buybacks.
And we’ve lost that innovation muscle. And the CHIPS Act — pulling that
together with the CHIPS Act — is the perfect opportunity to restore
that.”</p>
<p>The White House says this new investment could create 25,000
construction and manufacturing jobs. Academics say they’re churning out
workers at a rapid pace, but that still, America lacks talent.</p>
<p>“Our engineering college is the largest in the country, with over
33,000 enrolled students, and still we’re hearing from companies across
the semiconductor industry that they’re not able to get the talent they
need in time,” Zachary Holman, vice dean for research and innovation at
Arizona State University, told VOA.</p>
<p>And as the American industry stretches to keep pace, it races a
technical trend known as t: that the number of transistors in a computer
chip doubles about every two years. As a result, cutting-edge chips get
ever smaller as they grow in computing power.</p>
<p>TSMC in 2022 broke ground on a facility that makes the smallest chip
currently available, coming in at 3 nanometers — that’s just wider than
a strand of DNA.</p>

<h2
id="latino-voters-coveted-by-both-parties-are-targets-of-election-misinformation">Latino
voters, coveted by both parties, are targets of election
misinformation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>phoenix — As ranchera music filled the Phoenix recording studio at
Radio Campesina, a station personality spoke in Spanish into the
microphone. </p>
<p>“Friends of Campesina, in these elections, truth and unity are more
important than ever,” said morning show host Tony Arias. “Don’t let
yourself be trapped by disinformation.”</p>
<p>The audio was recorded as a promo for Radio Campesina’s new campaign
aiming to empower Latino voters ahead of the 2024 elections. That effort
includes discussing election-related misinformation narratives and
fact-checking conspiracy theories on air.</p>
<p>“We are at the front lines of fighting misinformation in our
communities,” said Maria Barquin, program director of Chavez Radio
Group, the nonprofit that runs Radio Campesina, a network of
Spanish-language stations in Arizona, California and Nevada. </p>
<p>“There’s a lot at stake in 2024 for our communities. And so, we need
to amp up these efforts now more than ever.”</p>
<p>Latinos have grown at the second-fastest rate, behind Asian
Americans, of any major racial or ethnic group in the U.S. since the
last presidential election, according to a Pew Research Center analysis,
and are projected to account for 14.7%, or 36.2 million, of all eligible
voters in November, a new high. They are a growing share of the
electorate in several presidential and congressional battleground
states, including Arizona, California and Nevada, and are being heavily
courted by Republicans and Democrats.</p>
<p>Democratic President Joe Biden has credited Latino voters as a key
reason he defeated Republican Donald Trump in 2020 and is urging them to
help him do it again in November. Given the high stakes of a
presidential election year, experts expect a surge of misinformation,
especially through audio and video, targeting Spanish-speaking
voters.</p>
<p>In addition to radio, much of the news and information Latinos
consume is audio-based through podcasts or social media platforms such
as Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube. Content moderation efforts in Spanish
are limited on these platforms, which are seeing a rising number of
right-wing influencers peddling election falsehoods and QAnon conspiracy
theories.</p>
<p>The types of misinformation overlap with falsehoods found in other
conservative media and many corners of the internet — conspiracy
theories about mail voting, dead people casting ballots, rigged voting
machines and threats at polling sites.</p>
<p>Other narratives are more closely tailored to Latino communities,
including false information about immigration, inflation and abortion
rights, often exploiting the traumas and fears of specific communities.
For example, Spanish speakers who have come from countries with recent
histories of authoritarianism, socialism, high inflation and election
fraud may be more vulnerable to misinformation about those topics.</p>
<p>Misinformation on the airwaves also is particularly difficult to
track and combat compared with more traditional, text-based
misinformation, said Daiquiri Ryan Mercado, strategic legal adviser and
policy counsel for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, which runs the
Spanish Language Disinformation Coalition. While misinformation
researchers can more easily code programs to categorize and track
text-based misinformation, audio often requires manual listening. Radio
stations that air only in certain areas at certain times also can be
difficult to track. </p>
<p>“When we have such limited representation, Spanish speakers feel like
they can connect to these people, and they become trusted messengers,”
Mercado said. “But some people may take advantage of that trust.”</p>
<p>Mercado and others said that’s why trusted messengers, such as Radio
Campesina, are so important. The station was founded by Mexican American
labor and civil rights leader Cesar Chavez and has built a loyal
listening base over decades. At any given moment, as many as 750,000
people are listening to the Chavez Radio Network on the air and online,
Barquin said.</p>
<p>“They will come and listen to us because of the music, but our main
focus is to empower and educate through information,” she said. “The
music is just a tactic to bring them in.”</p>
<p>Radio Campesina’s on-air talent and musical guests often discuss
misinformation on air, answering listeners’ questions about voting,
teaching them about spotting misinformation and doing tutorials on
election processes, such as how to submit mail-in ballots. The station
also has hosted rodeos and music events to register new voters and talk
about misinformation.</p>
<p>They allow listeners to call or text questions on WhatsApp, a social
media platform especially popular with immigrant communities but where
much of the misinformation they see festers. In March, the station
partnered with Mi Familia Vota, a Latino advocacy group, for an on-air
show and voter phone bank event to answer voter questions.</p>
<p>“We know that there are many people who are unmotivated because
sometimes we come from countries where, when it comes to elections, we
don’t trust the vote,” said Carolina Rodriguez-Greer, Arizona director
of Mi Familia Vota, before she shared information on the show about how
voters can track their ballots.</p>
<p>The organization began working with Spanish media outlets to dispel
misinformation after seeing candidates such as former Arizona
gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake spread election lies in 2022,
Rodriguez-Greer said. Lake is now running for the U.S. Senate with
Trump’s endorsement.</p>
<p>“One way to combat this misinformation is to fill the airways with
good information,” said Angelica Razo, national deputy director of
campaigns and programs for Mi Familia Vota.</p>
<p>A variety of other community and media groups also are prioritizing
the seemingly never-ending fight against misinformation.</p>
<p>Maritza Felix often fact-checked misinformation for her mother, whom
she calls the “Queen of WhatsApp.” This led to Felix doing the same for
family and friends in a WhatsApp group that grew into the Spanish news
nonprofit Conecta Arizona.</p>
<p>It now runs a radio show and newsletter that debunks false claims
about election processes, health, immigration and border politics.
Conecta Arizona also combats misinformation about the upcoming Mexican
presidential election that Felix said has been seeping over the
border.</p>
<p>The Spanish-language fact-checking group Factchequeado is building
partnerships with dozens of media outlets across the country to provide
training and free Spanish fact-checking content.</p>
<p>“Disinformation is at the same time a global phenomenon and a
hyperlocal phenomenon,” said Factchequeado co-founder Laura Zommer. “So,
we have to address it with local and national groups uniting
together.”</p>

id="chinese-nationalist-trolls-pretend-to-be-trump-supporters-ahead-of-us-elections">Chinese
nationalist trolls pretend to be Trump supporters ahead of US
elections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — British researchers say Chinese nationalist trolls have
been posing as American supporters of former President Donald Trump on X
to try to exploit domestic divisions ahead of the U.S. election.</p>
<p>A report released April 1 by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a
London think tank, says it found four previous Mandarin-tweeting
accounts that went silent before re-emerging as American Trump supporter
personas tweeting in English.</p>
<p>It linked them to China’s so-called Spamouflage network, which it
described as a “long-running and widespread but largely ineffective”
campaign to promote pro-Chinese Communist Party narratives.</p>
<p>But Elise Thomas, a senior researcher at the institute and author of
the report, said pretending to be Trump supporters is a fresh and more
effective tactic.</p>
<p>“They are posing convincingly as Americans, specifically Trump
supporters,” she told VOA. “They are getting engagement from what look
like real American users. That’s significantly different from what we’ve
seen with Spamouflage in the past.”</p>
<p>She pointed out that a traditional Spamouflage tweet might have many
likes and retweets, but upon further examination, it’s all from other
Spamouflage accounts. Now, they are interacting with predominantly
genuine American users.</p>
<p>“What they are doing that is quite different from other Spamouflage
accounts is that they are building up authentic audiences using this
thing called patriot follow trains, which is basically where people
agree to mutually follow one another in order to each build their own
follower accounts,” Thomas explained.</p>
<p>Using real viral videos and photos, these accounts seek to amplify
divisive issues such as LGBTQ rights, immigration, race, gun control and
crime rates.</p>
<p>Some of the accounts mock Biden’s age; others falsely claim that
Biden is a pedophile. All seem to be promoting Trump’s slogan “Make
America Great Again (MAGA),” leading the report to dub this new tactic
“MAGAflage.”</p>
<p>One of the X accounts, Ben MAGA 2024, was opened in 2010, but
previous posts have been deleted. Since April 18, 2023, the account
began to tweet in English with a main theme: Biden is a pedophile and
cannot be trusted.</p>
<p>The account tries to build a persona as an American living in Los
Angeles. It posted a picture in January with the caption “Good morning!
Patriots, I’m 43 years old, and passionately and loyally supporting
President Trump!”</p>
<p>In fact, the picture belongs to a travel blog by a Danish man with no
indication that he’s a Trump supporter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This account also retweeted a video from Russian state media Russia
Today on February 18, claiming that Biden and the Central Intelligence
Agency had sent a neo-Nazi leader to fight in Ukraine.</p>
<p>That post was retweeted by Alex Jones, an American far-right
conspiracy theorist and radio show host with 2.2 million followers on X.
The post had been viewed nearly 360,000 times as of March 4.</p>
<p>Thomas said by wrapping a topic in a U.S. partisan political frame,
they got “a reasonable amount of engagement” from real American
users.</p>
<p>This mimics Russia’s playbook during the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, when U.S. officials say Moscow used information warfare to
damage the Clinton campaign, boost Trump’s chances and sow distrust in
American democracy, which the Kremlin denies.</p>
<p>The report said some Spamouflage accounts could also be posing as
left-wing Biden supporters, though they did not find any.</p>
<p>Twitter has since suspended all the accounts mentioned in the
institute’s report.</p>
<p>While just a handful of accounts were identified, the report says
there are almost certainly many more, which Thomas worries could have an
unseen effect on the U.S. election.</p>
<p>“These [MAGAflage] accounts were very difficult to find. It took
quite a lot of time, and I’ve only been able to find a relatively small
number of them,” she said. “But because what we know from Spamouflage’s
history is that everything it does, it does at massive scale. It would
be really out of character for them to be only doing this, if it’s
effective, at a small scale. So, that’s my concern, that it may be
happening at a significantly larger scale.”</p>
<p>VOA reached out to the Trump and Biden campaigns for comment but did
not receive a response as of publication time.</p>
<p>The Spamouflage network was discovered in 2019 by social media
analytics firm Graphika and was first used to target Hong Kong
pro-democracy protesters.</p>
<p>Researchers said the network is tied to “individuals associated with
Chinese law enforcement,” and has been active across thousands of
accounts and more than 50 platforms and forums, including Facebook,
Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and X.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On March 11, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
issued its annual assessment on the major threats to U.S. interests
around the world and warned that China’s government may “attempt to
influence the U.S. elections in 2024 at some level because of its desire
to sideline critics of China and magnify U.S. societal divisions.”</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
said in a statement sent to VOA that China is “committed to the
principle of noninterference” and that claims about Beijing influencing
U.S. presidential elections are “completely fabricated.”</p>
<p>Meta in August shut down close to 9,000 Facebook and Instagram
accounts, groups and pages associated with the Spamouflage network.</p>

‘Frogman’ Henry, R&amp;B singer of 1956 hit ‘Ain’t Got No Home,’
dies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new orleans — Clarence “Frogman” Henry, who was one of New Orleans’
best known old-time R&amp;B singers and scored a hit at age 19 with
“Ain’t Got No Home,” has died. He was 87.</p>
<p>Henry died Sunday night, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation
said on social media. It didn’t give the cause of death.</p>
<p>Henry, who had been scheduled to perform at the New Orleans Jazz
&amp; Heritage Festival later this month, imitated the voice of a frog
in “Ain’t Got No Home.” It was a hit in 1956 and later brought Henry
renewed fame when it was featured on the “Forrest Gump” and “Mickey Blue
Eyes” soundtracks.</p>
<p>He credited disc jockey Poppa Stoppa, whose real name was Clarence
Hayman, as coming up with the nickname the “Frogman,” which mimicked
Fats Domino’s moniker the “Fatman.”</p>
<p>By 1958, Henry’s popularity waned, and he took to playing nightclubs
on Bourbon Street.</p>
<p>“I thought the sun would shine. I thought my record would always stay
out there and stay on the top, but in 1958, the rain came and bring me
back to New Orleans,” Henry told The Associated Press in 2003.</p>
<p>But in 1960, a new song, “I Don’t Know Why But I Do” by Cajun
songwriter Bobby Charles and arranged by Allen Toussaint, brought Henry
renewed success.</p>
<p>With the Bill Black Combo and the Jive Five, he opened for the
Beatles for 18 dates in 1964 during their first U.S. trip and toured
extensively, from Scotland to New Zealand.</p>
<p>In Louisiana, Henry remained popular. He also was one of the few
Black New Orleans musicians to cross over into Cajun musical
circles.</p>
<p>Henry, who was born in New Orleans on March 19, 1937, started playing
the piano at 8, taking up lessons his sister had disliked. He worked for
his father until he was 15, often for no money.</p>
<p>He played the trombone and piano in his high school band and later
joined The Toppers, traveling around southern Louisiana before making it
big.</p>
<p>“When I was going to school, I wanted to be Fats Domino, Professor
Longhair, and I would wear a wig with two plaits and call myself
Professor Longhair,” Henry told the AP. “I like the Fats Domino rhythm,
but I play my own chords and my own style.”</p>
<p>Henry’s national fame faded but he remained popular in Louisiana. He
was a Bourbon Street fixture until 1981, when he retired from the
grueling club circuit. But he never gave up music and continued to be an
annual crowd pleaser at the Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival.</p>
<p>Funeral arrangements are pending at the Murray Henderson Funeral
Home.</p>

<h2 id="intels-ambitious-meteor-lake-igpu">Intel’s ambitious Meteor Lake
iGPU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Intel and AMD both tried to ship iGPUs fast enough to compete with
low end discrete cards over the past 10 years with mixed results.
Recently though, powerful iGPUs have been thrown back into the
spotlight. Handhelds like Valve’s Steam Deck and ASUS’s ROG Ally
demonstrated that consumers are willing to accept compromises to play
games on the go. AMD has dominated that market so far. Valve’s Steam
Deck uses AMD’s Van Gogh APU, and the ROG Ally uses the newer Phoenix
APU. Unlike Van Gogh, Phoenix is a general purpose mobile chip with both
a powerful CPU and GPU. Phoenix doesn’t stop at targeting the handheld
segment, and threatens Intel’s laptop market share too. In response,
Meteor Lake brings a powerful iGPU to the party. It has the equivalent
of 128 EUs and clocks up to 2.25 GHz, making it modestly wider and much
faster than Raptor Lake’s 96 EU, 1.5 GHz iGPU. Raptor Lake’s Xe-LP
graphics architecture gets replaced by Xe-LPG, a close relative of the
Xe-HPG architecture used in Intel’s A770 discrete GPU. At the system
level, Meteor Lake moves to a GPU integration scheme that better suits a
chiplet configuration where the iGPU gets significant transistor and
area budget. I’ll be testing Meteor Lake’s iGPU with the Core Ultra 7
155H, as implemented in the ASUS Zenbook 14. I purchased the device
myself in late February. ↫ Chips and Cheese I’m absolutely here for the
resurgence in capable integrated GPUs, both for PC gaming on the go and
for better graphics performance even in thinner, smaller laptops. I
would love to have just a bit more graphics power on my thin and small
laptop so I can do some basic gaming with it.</p>

<h2 id="judge-rejects-trumps-bid-to-delay-hush-money-trial">Judge
rejects Trump’s bid to delay hush money trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A New York appeals court judge Monday rejected Donald
Trump’s bid to delay his hush money criminal trial, set to start April
15, while he fights to move the case out of Manhattan.</p>
<p>Justice Lizbeth Gonzalez of the state’s midlevel appeals court made
her ruling after an emergency hearing where Trump’s attorneys asked to
postpone the trial indefinitely while they seek a change of venue. Trump
was seeking an emergency stay, a court order that would prevent the
trial from starting on time.</p>
<p>The hush money trial is the first of Trump’s four criminal
indictments slated to go to trial and would be the first criminal trial
ever of a former president.</p>
<p>Trump attorney Emil Bove argued that the presumptive Republican
nominee faces “real potential prejudice” as a defendant in heavily
Democratic Manhattan. Citing defense surveys and a review of media
coverage, Bove argued that jury selection “cannot proceed in a fair
manner.”</p>
<p>Trump has suggested on social media that the trial should be moved to
Staten Island, the only New York City borough he won in 2016 and
2020.</p>
<p>Steven Wu, appellate chief for the Manhattan district attorney’s
office, noted that trial Judge Juan M. Merchan had already rejected
Trump’s requests to move or delay the trial as untimely. </p>
<p>“The question in this case is not whether a random poll of New
Yorkers from whatever neighborhood are able to be impartial, it’s about
whether a trial court is able to select a jury of 12 impartial jurors,”
Wu said. He blamed Trump for stoking pretrial publicity with “countless
media appearances talking about the facts of this case, the witnesses
and so on.”</p>
<p>In a separate appellate matter, Trump’s lawyers are also challenging
a gag order imposed on him in the case, which Merchan recently expanded
to prohibit Trump from making comments about the judge’s family. The
appeals court signaled it would take up that matter later.</p>
<p>Paperwork relating to Trump’s appeals was placed under seal and not
publicly available.</p>
<p>Trump had pledged to appeal after Merchan ruled last month that the
trial would begin April 15. His lawyers had pleaded to delay the trial
at least until summer to give them more time to review late-arriving
evidence from a prior federal investigation into the matter.</p>
<p>Merchan, who had already moved the trial from its original March 25
start date because of the evidence issue, said no further delays were
warranted.</p>
<p>Trump’s attorneys filed their appeals Monday on two separate court
dockets. One was styled as a lawsuit against Merchan, a legal mechanism
allowing them to challenge his rulings.</p>
<p>In New York, judges can be sued over some judicial decisions under a
state law known as Article 78. Trump has used the tactic before,
including against the judge in his civil fraud case in an unsuccessful
last-minute bid to delay that case last fall.</p>
<p>In this case, he is accused of falsifying his company’s records to
hide the nature of payments to his former attorney and fixer, Michael
Cohen, who helped him bury negative stories during his 2016 campaign.
Cohen’s activities included paying porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to
suppress her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump years
earlier.</p>
<p>Trump pleaded not guilty last year to 34 felony counts of falsifying
business records. He has denied having a sexual encounter with Daniels.
His lawyers argue the payments to Cohen were legitimate legal
expenses.</p>
<p>Trump’s move Monday was the latest escalation in his battles with
Merchan. </p>
<p>Trump assailed the judge on social media after he imposed a gag order
last month barring Trump from making public statements about jurors,
witnesses and others connected the case. After Trump’s complaints,
Merchan expanded the gag order to include members of his own family.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump renewed his request for the judge to step aside from
the case, citing Merchan’s daughter’s work as the head of a firm whose
clients have included his rival, President Joe Biden, Vice President
Kamala Harris and other Democrats.</p>
<p>The former president alleges the judge is biased against him and has
a conflict of interest because of his daughter’s work. The judge
rejected a similar request last August.</p>
<p>Trump has also made numerous other attempts to get the trial
postponed, echoing a strategy he’s deployed in his other criminal cases.
“We want delays,” Trump proclaimed to TV cameras outside a February
pretrial hearing in his hush money case.</p>
<p>Merchan last week rejected his request to delay the trial until the
U.S. Supreme Court rules on presidential immunity claims he raised in
another of his criminal cases.</p>
<p>Trump also filed an eve-of-trial lawsuit against the judge in his New
York civil fraud case, accusing the jurist of repeatedly abusing his
authority. Among other issues, Trump’s lawyers in that case complained
that Judge Arthur Engoron had refused their request to delay the trial.
Their suit was filed about three weeks before the trial was slated to
begin.</p>
<p>A state appeals court rejected Trump’s claims, and the trial started
as scheduled October 2.</p>
<p>During the civil trial, Trump sued Engoron again, this time over a
gag order he’d issued after Trump smeared the judge’s principal law
clerk in a social media post. The gag order barred parties in the case —
and, later, their lawyers as well — from commenting publicly on court
staffers, though not on the judge himself.</p>
<p>A sole appeals judge lifted the gag order, but a four-judge appellate
panel ultimately restored it two weeks later. The panel said Trump’s
lawyers should have followed a normal appeals process instead of suing
the judge. Trump’s attorneys said they had been trying to move
quickly.</p>
<p>Engoron, who decided that case without a jury, ruled that Trump, his
company and key executives defrauded bankers and insurers by overstating
his wealth in documents used to get loans and coverage. Trump denied any
wrongdoing and is appealing the finding and over $454 million in
penalties and interest.</p>

launches new Find My Device network on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, the all-new Find My Device is rolling out to Android devices
around the world, starting in the U.S. and Canada. With a new,
crowdsourced network of over a billion Android devices, Find My Device
can help you find your misplaced Android devices and everyday items
quickly and securely. Here are five ways you can try it out. ↫ Erik Kay
on the Google blog This old Android feature has basically been updated
to be the same thing as Apple’s Find My, but with more than just one
vendor making the tracking tags. Of course, this means it also comes
with the same problems, from its use by stalkers to controlling
partners, and everything in between. This is a very problematic
technology, one which I think is almost impossible to make safe. Still,
I have a Samsung tracker that I don’t use anymore – because I bought a
Pixel 8 Pro, and don’t want to install any Samsung applications – and I
do plan on getting a new tracker that’s compatible with this new Find My
Device network. With two small kids, it’s easy to lose track of
something like my car keys, and instead of stressing about where they
are when we need to leave on time, I can just ping them using our Google
Home devices instead. Sometimes, these silly smart technologies really
do take just that little bit of stress out of your life – you just have
to be really picky and honest with yourself about what you really
need.</p>

Volcanic Energy?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
In 1881, King David Kalakaua of Hawaii and his entourage paid a late
evening visit to Thomas Edison in New York. The king
<a href="https://hawaiiankingdom.org/blog/kalakaua-visits-edison-the-king-in-search-of-a-means-to-light-up-honolulu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was
unsure about electricity</a> — he didn’t think the technology was
reliable enough to light up Honolulu’s streets just yet — but after
marveling at a chandelier buzzing with electric light, the group started
bantering about how Hawaii could generate power. What about putting
boilers atop a volcano? There was enough energy up there, a companion to
the king mused, that it could illuminate the entire United States. He
appeared to be joking, but Edison took the notion seriously. Nice idea,
he told his visitors, but an undersea cable carrying power to the
mainland would be far too expensive.
</p>
<p>
Honolulu got its new streetlights a few months later — powered, in the
end, by a hydroelectric dam. The volcano thought would wait a century
longer.
</p>
<p>
In the 1970s, geologists began drilling into the eastern rift of the Big
Island’s Kilauea volcano, resulting, in 1993, in Hawaii’s first
geothermal power plant, which is today called the Puna Geothermal
Venture, or PGV. The 38-megawatt facility straddles the most active rift
of Hawaii’s most active volcano and is, to this day, the state’s only
geothermal plant, supplying just 3% of the islands’ energy. That status
quo puzzles geothermal advocates elsewhere. The obvious comparison is to
a volcanic sibling like Iceland, where the Earth’s radiant heat supplies
25% of the country’s consumer electricity needs and more than 70% of its
overall energy.
</p>
<p>
“It’s been talked about for ages that at some point, Hawaii needs to
have a reset on geothermal,” Mark Glick, Hawaii’s Chief Energy Officer,
told me. “That time is now.” So far, that reset involves the governor’s
office directing discretionary COVID relief funds with the aim of
getting an essentially moribund industry off the ground. Five million
dollars will go toward a drilling program to explore the geology of
promising areas of heat, hopefully with results that encourage potential
developers to make their own, bigger investments. Site selection is
underway, with Maui and the Big Island at the top of the list, and Glick
said local outreach will begin in the next few months.
</p>
<p>
That the vast underground heat resources of a place like Maui are only
now getting even basic attention is “mind-boggling,” Glick said. But
it’s also a reflection of decades of turmoil over all things geothermal
in the state — clashes with neighbors, toxic incidents, failed dreams of
grandiose infrastructure. That has to change, he added, if the state is
serious about ditching its dirtiest forms of power generation quickly.
Hawaii has committed to reaching a 100% clean energy portfolio by 2045,
but was still producing as much as 80% of its electricity from burning
petroleum by last year.
</p>
<p>
Like other states endowed with abundant heat, Hawaii was previously
inspired to consider geothermal energy during the 1970s oil crisis. The
state was dependent on imported fuel, and the regularly lava-spewing
Kilauea, in particular, looked like “a no-brainer” for geothermal
development, explains Roland Horne, director of the Stanford Geothermal
Program and a noted historian of the industry.
</p>
<p>
Hawaii’s problem is that, in addition to being an island chain, it’s
also a chain of separate electric grids. With no power lines connecting
the Big Island — home to 14% percent of the state’s population — to any
others, Kilauea’s energy was marooned. Initially, the state imagined
<a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/items/03a31e32-d17b-4708-9a1e-87bb859904da" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unifying</a>
its disparate grids in parallel with geothermal development. But Edison,
it turns out, was right about undersea cables, even relatively short
ones. After a decade of planning and testing that included laying
prototype wires across the 6,100-feet deep, 30-mile wide ’Alenuihaha
Channel between the Big Island and Maui found that such a project was
technically feasible
<a href="https://hahaha.typepad.com/files/geoheat.oit.edu.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">but
would be far too expensive</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, oil prices fell, and so did interest in hunting for hot rock
elsewhere. Although a statewide survey that began in the 1970s found
most of the islands could harbor geothermal resources — even older,
geologically colder islands like Oahu and even Kauai — nobody followed
up. “It led to almost nothing for three decades,” said Nicole Lautze, a
geologist at the University of Hawaii-Manoa who is overseeing the
state’s current exploratory projects. Instead, the state remained
dependent on imported oil.
</p>
<p>
Other problems were more island-specific. Drilling into an active
volcano is fairly unusual for geothermal prospectors and presents unique
challenges, given the proximity of lava and abundance of toxic gasses.
The work on Kilauea was controversial from the start, with nearby
residents and Native Hawaiian spiritual practitioners calling the
project not just unsafe but sacrilegious. A
<a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/882452" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">release</a>
of hydrogen sulfide during construction in 1991 only added to the
controversy.
</p>
<p>
Toxic emissions, including sulfur, from geothermal facilities are
generally minuscule compared with fossil fuel plants—and part of the
everyday dangers of living on a volcanic slope, Horne told me. “They
were coming out of the ground long before Puna was ever built,” he said.
But PGV’s reputation as a danger to the community was hard to shake.
When geothermal has made headlines in the state over the years since,
the story has generally been PGV’s uneasy relationship with the volcano
— most notably during Kilauea’s 2018 eruption, during which the plant
was totally surrounded by lava flows. Neighbors remained fiercely
opposed to the plant when it reopened two years later.
</p>
<p>
In 2014, when Lautze was tapped for a new survey of that state’s
geothermal resources, the word “geothermal” was so taboo that she was
reluctant to tell anyone locally her line of work. But she had funding
from the U.S. Department of Energy, thanks to the federal government’s
resurgent interest in geothermal as a source of clean, firm energy.
Popular perception in Hawaii held that the Earth’s heat could only be
tapped on the Big Island, where magma was breaching the surface, but
Lautze was intrigued by the possibility of finding resources on islands
that are less geologically volatile and home to more people. She set
about developing new simulations for subsurface heat across the state,
followed by on-the-ground experiments.
</p>
<p>
On islands like Lanai and Maui, Lautze said her team received a warmer
welcome than expected. Certain benefits of geothermal had become much
more clear amidst the state’s rush to adopt renewable energy — among
them, that geothermal power would take a fraction of the land required
to produce the same electricity from wind turbines or solar panels, in
addition to providing continuous power, regardless of the weather.
“Hawaii is realizing that they’re not going to get to 100 percent
renewable from solar and wind alone,” said Lautze. Plus, she added, “the
cost of energy is going up and up and up.”
</p>
<p>
The next step toward tapping that heat is what’s known as “slim hole”
drilling, using bits less than 7 inches wide to descend more than a
kilometer down. Even promising hotspots can be duds, and developers are
often hesitant even in well-mapped places, which Hawaii isn’t. Before
the state tries to sell geothermal companies on the idea of coming to
Hawaii, officials want to be sure of what they’re selling. “There’s an
absolute dearth of information on the volcanically older islands,”
Lautze said.
</p>
<p>
Mike Kaleikini, head of Hawaii affairs for Ormat, which owns PGV, told
me he’s been heartened to see the state turning its attention to basic
research. Developers could very well get excited about places like Maui,
he said, with some initial exploration already done and if they feel
they can navigate permitting and potential concerns from the public.
“Hawaii is not the easiest place to do business,” he added.
</p>
<p>
Among the better prospects for new development is on Big Island land
owned by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, an agency that works to
redistribute homes and land to Native Hawaiians. Located on the more
docile slopes of Mauna Kea, the project’s backers say it could both
power DHHL’s housing developments and generate royalties that help
finance more home building.
</p>
<p>
Whatever heat developers strike there will remain marooned on the Big
Island, at least for now. Channeling the dream of near-endless volcanic
energy, Glick’s office proposed tying the Big Island’s geothermal
production
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/clean-hydrogen-shell-emissions" target="_self">to
a regional hydrogen hub</a> so that the energy could be shipped
offshore, but the DOE ultimately passed on funding the plan. Lautze
still dreams of wires strung across the unruly Hawaiian channels. People
still talk about the idea, she noted, even if it elicits smirks and
eyerolls from people who lived through its past failures. The state is
still a far cry from achieving the king’s dream. But the only way to get
there is to start drilling.

Trump hold different views on key foreign policy issues</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden, the Democratic Party’s 2024
presidential nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican
Party’s presumptive nominee, hold very different views on key foreign
and domestic issues. Here’s an overview of where each one stands on
foreign policy.  </p>
<p>Russia-Ukraine  </p>
<p>Biden endorses sending military and humanitarian assistance to
Ukraine to aid its fight against Russia, while warning that Western
countries cannot allow Russian President Vladimir Putin to achieve
victory. To date, the Biden administration has sanctioned Russian
individuals and entities and sent $75 billion in assistance to Ukraine
since the February 2022 Russian invasion. </p>
<p>Biden said on March 7, 2024, “Putin of Russia is on the march,
invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond. If
anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you, he
will not. But Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and
provide the weapons it needs to defend itself. That is all Ukraine is
asking. They are not asking for American soldiers.”  </p>
<p>Trump has said NATO countries are not paying their share of aid to
Ukraine and claimed the United States has sent more than other
countries. At a February rally, Trump said he told an unnamed NATO
member that he would encourage Russia “to do whatever the hell they
want” to any alliance member that does not meet spending guidelines on
defense. In a 2023 speech in New Hampshire, Trump said, “Shortly after I
win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and
Ukraine settled.”  </p>
<p>Throughout his presidency, Trump faced multiple accusations of
collusion with Russia and was impeached by the U.S. House of
Representatives on Dec. 18, 2019, for charges he leveraged U.S. aid to
Ukraine in return for damaging information on potential political rival
Joe Biden. Trump denied those charges and was later acquitted by the
U.S. Senate.  </p>
<p>China </p>
<p>Biden said on March 7, 2024, “We have the best economy in the world.
And since I’ve come to office, our GDP is up, our trade deficit with
China is down to the lowest point over a decade and we’re standing up
against China’s unfair economic practices. We’re standing up for peace
and stability across the Taiwan Strait. I’ve revitalized our partnership
and alliance in the Pacific. India, Australia, Japan, South Korea,
Pacific Islands. I made sure that the most advanced American
technologies can’t be used in China, not allowing to trade them there.
Frankly, for all this tough talk on China, it never occurred to my
predecessor to do any of that. I want competition with China, not
conflict. And we’re in a stronger position to win the conflict of the
21st century against China than anyone else, for that matter, than any
time as well.” </p>
<p>During his presidency, Trump denounced the threat posed by the
Chinese Communist Party as the most significant foreign policy challenge
of this generation. He said China was responsible for the COVID-19
pandemic and penalized China for ending the “one country, two states”
policy in Hong Kong. In a May 2020 speech, Trump said, “The United
States wants an open and constructive relationship with China, but
achieving that relationship requires us to vigorously defend our
national interests.”  </p>
<p>On his campaign website, Trump said, “To protect our country, we need
to enact aggressive new restrictions on Chinese ownership of any vital
infrastructure in the United States, including energy, technology,
telecommunications, farmland, natural resources, medical supplies, and
other strategic national assets. We should stop all future Chinese
purchases in these essential industries. And we should begin the process
of forcing the Chinese to sell any current holdings that put our
national security at risk.”  </p>
<p>Israel-Palestinians  </p>
<p>Biden says Israel has a right to go after Hamas but has warned Israel
against killing Palestinian civilians. In March, Biden announced the
construction of an offshore port to deliver aid to Gaza.  </p>
<p>Biden said in New York on March 9, 2024, “I’m never going to leave
Israel. The defense of Israel is still critical, so there’s no red line
I’m going to cut off all weapons, so they don’t have the Iron Dome to
protect them. They don’t have … but there’s red lines that if he crosses
and they continue … you cannot have 30,000 more Palestinians dead as a
consequence of going after, there’s other ways to deal, to get to, to
deal with the trauma caused by Hamas.”  </p>
<p>Trump released a Middle East peace plan in 2020 calling for a
two-state solution that would have given Israel control of a unified
Jerusalem and maintained its settlements in the West Bank.  </p>
<p>In an interview with the Israel Hayom newspaper on March 25, 2024,
Trump said of the current conflict, “What I saw October 7 was one of the
saddest things I’ve ever seen. … You have to finish up your war. To
finish it up. You got to get it done. And I am sure you will do that.
And we got to get to peace; we can’t have this going on. And I will say,
Israel has to be very careful, because you’re losing a lot of the world,
you’re losing a lot of support, you have to finish up, you have to get
the job done. And you have to get on to peace, to get on to a normal
life for Israel.”  </p>
<p>Iran </p>
<p>Biden spent more than two years attempting to restore the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the nuclear agreement negotiated
by the Obama administration before declaring it “dead.” Last year, the
Biden administration negotiated the release of five American hostages in
return for unfreezing billions in Iranian assets.  </p>
<p>Biden said in Washington on March 7, 2024, “Creating stability in the
Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran. That’s why I
built a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international
shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. I’ve ordered strikes
to degrade the Houthi capability and defend U.S. forces in the region.
As commander in chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to
protect our people and our military personnel.” </p>
<p>Among Trump’s proudest achievements was the withdrawal of the United
States from the JCPOA. He also authorized the strike that killed Qasem
Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force — the terrorist branch of the
Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC — a move he called
“the boldest action of his presidency.” </p>
<p>North Korea </p>
<p>The Biden administration has repeatedly stated it is open to
negotiations with North Korea with no preconditions but has yet to offer
any incentives in the form of economic assistance to encourage North
Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to open talks. Biden has met with regional
allies and last year announced a new nuclear deterrence agreement, with
South Korea, that would allow the U.S. to dock submarines in South
Korean ports.  </p>
<p>During his presidency, Trump pursued “complete, verifiable, and
irreversible denuclearization” of North Korea but eventually developed a
good personal relationship with Jong-Un after multiple meetings. His
personal diplomacy did not result in any agreements between the two
countries. </p>

Eclipse Was a 3-Hour Boon for Gas, Batteries, and Hydro</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTk1MTAxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MjgzODk1NX0.xJGOcymdS1Q5QhCRXLTIZ7CzeOOjYLYHLImkhoGmwS0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Early April is typically a kind of goldilocks moment for solar power.
Days are getting longer but the weather is still mild, meaning that
higher solar power generation isn’t entirely eaten up by increased
demand due to air conditioning.
</p>
<p>
But that all depends on the sun actually shining.
</p>
<p>
Monday’s solar eclipse took a big chunk of power off the grid. Since
2017’s eclipse, solar power generation has increased substantially, both
locally (think rooftops) and at utility scale (think massive fields of
solar panels). In 2017, the U.S. had around
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy19osti/72170.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">35
gigawatts</a> of utility-scale solar capacity, a figure that had
increased to an estimated
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61242" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">95
gigawatts</a> by the end of 2023.
</p>
<p>
While total solar eclipses are rare (the next one to hit the lower 48
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/total-solar-eclipse-04-07-24-scn/index.html#:~:text=on%20US%20soil.-,The%20next%20total%20solar%20eclipse%20won't%20be%20visible%20across,%2C%202026%2C%20according%20to%20NASA." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">isn’t
expected until 2044</a>), the challenges they present to grid operators
may be part of the new normal. With vastly expanded renewable energy
generation comes a greater degree of unpredictability, as a growing a
portion of the generation fleet can drop off the grid due to weather and
climate conditions — like, say,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-power-has-a-wildfire-smoke-problem" target="_self">clouds
of smoke from a wildfire</a> — that
<a href="https://www.space.com/predicting-solar-eclipses-newton-halley.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cannot
be precisely predicted</a> by 17th century science.
</p>
<p>
Grid operators were confident they’d be able to manage through the
eclipse without any reliability issues, and what actually transpired
mostly confirmed their forecasts. In Texas, solar power production
shrunk from around 13.5 gigawatts at noon, making up 27% of the grid’s
electricity supply, to a mere 0.8 gigawatts at 1:30 p.m. Things did not
go as well for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, however,
which includes a swath of the middle of the country from Minnesota to
Indiana to Louisiana. Solar output was estimated to drop from around 4
gigawatts at 1 p.m. Central time to 2 gigawatts an hour later, according
to Grid Status. Instead, output dropped to around 300 megawatts, causing
real-time prices for power on the grid to spike.

</p>
<p>
Overall,
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61743" target="_blank">the
U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated</a> that some 6,500
megawatts of solar generation capacity would be fully obscured during
the eclipse, which would “partially block sunlight to facilities with a
combined 84.8 GW of capacity in an even larger swath of the United
States around peak solar generating time.” Some 40 gigawatts may have
come off the grid, enough power for about 28 million homes, according to
a release from Solcast, a solar forecasting company.
</p>
<p>
By comparison, during the 2017 eclipse, solar power loss at its peak was
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy18osti/71147.pdf" target="_blank">between
4 and 6.5 gigawatts</a> and the total loss of power was around 11
gigawatts, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
</p>
<p>
In states like Texas, the main effect was on utility-scale production of
solar, but in the Northeast and parts of the mid-Atlantic and Midwest,
there was also a related problem: Behind-the-meter solar fell off, too,
thus requiring the homes and businesses that generate power for
themselves in the middle of the day to get more power from the grid,
increasing demand on the grid at a time of low supply.
</p>
<p>
New England has seen immense growth in rooftop solar, and
<a href="https://isonewswire.com/2024/03/07/iso-ne-preparing-for-aprils-total-solar-eclipse/?utm_source=isone&utm_medium=newsfeed" target="_blank">solar
production was expected to fall</a> by “thousands” of megawatts,
according to ISO New England, while the New York Independent System
Operators expected to lose 700 megawatts of behind the meter solar.
</p>
<p>
During the 2017 eclipse, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found
that “the burden of compensating for the lost energy from solar
generators fell to the thermal fleet,” i.e. natural gas, along with some
increases in coal and hydropower production.
</p>
<p>
Since then, the coal fleet has shrunk, thus putting more of the burden
of responding to Monday’s eclipse onto gas and hydro, but the basic
logic still applies. “Grid operators are expected to rely on natural gas
to ensure stability and meet the household demand spike across national
grids, as was done during the previous eclipse in 2023 in California and
Texas,” according to Solcast. As the sun was dimming in Texas, natural
gas generation rose from 18.7 gigawatts to 27.5 gigawatts.
</p>
<p>
Something else that’s changed since 2017: batteries. By the end of 2023,
Texas had installed
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/texas-will-add-more-grid-batteries-than-any-other-state-in-2024" target="_blank">5.6
gigawatts of grid storage</a>, most of it providing so-called
“<a href="https://modoenergy.com/research/ercot-battery-energy-storage-ancillary-services-ecrs-non-spinning-reserve-regulation-saturation-2024" target="_blank">ancillary
services</a>,” power sources that can respond quickly to immediate
needs. ERCOT, the electricity market that covers most of Texas,
<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2024/02/19/10.2%20System%20Operations%20Update_v3.pdf" target="_blank">said
in a presentation</a> back in February that it would rely on these
ancillary tools to get through the eclipse, and once again, it was
right. Power from batteries on the grid got up 1.4 gigawatts during the
eclipse.
</p>

effects of the eclipse on U.S. power generation.</em><br/>

id="regretting-coming-to-us-some-illegal-chinese-immigrants-return-home">Regretting
coming to US, some illegal Chinese immigrants return home</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Austin, Texas — Chinese migrants coming across the southern U.S.
border say they made the treacherous journey to flee China’s
authoritarian rule, to seek the American dream or escape growing
political and economic uncertainty at home.</p>
<p>But the challenges do not end after they arrive, and some are
deciding to return to China, while others have no choice.</p>
<p>Last April, Xia Yu arrived in the United States after traveling
through more than 10 countries over a period of two months. Xia, a
Chinese man in his 40s, asked to use a pseudonym so he could speak more
freely with VOA Mandarin about his journey.</p>
<p>On his way to the U.S. border, he says, all his property was stolen,
and his American dream did not come true: In immigration custody, he
failed to pass the “credible fear interview” for asylum-seekers.</p>
<p>2023 surge</p>
<p>According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, 52,700 Chinese
immigrants arrived at U.S. borders without valid entry visas in fiscal
2023 — more than twice the number of just two years earlier. About half
of them entered somewhere along the southern U.S. border where they were
apprehended by Border Protection agents and sought asylum.</p>
<p>Individuals who pass the screening and establish that they have a
credible reason to fear torture, persecution, or returning to their
country, are allowed to stay in the U.S. to pursue their cases in
immigration court.</p>
<p>Xia remained in the detention facility in the U.S. for months as he
was processed for deportation, eventually landing at Shanghai Pudong
Airport last August. Entering Chinese customs, he was fined $71 and had
to sign a document admitting his crime of being deported after illegally
entering another country. His passport was confiscated, and he was
notified that he would be barred from leaving the country for three
years.</p>
<p>The public security bureau in his hometown also questioned him about
whom he encountered while on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>“They asked me to delete my foreign social media apps and foreign
contacts,” he told VOA. “Then they told me not to contact these people
because I would be deceived.” </p>
<p>Xia said he thinks his WeChat account is being monitored to prevent
him from inciting others to emigrate illegally. He said spending tens of
thousands of dollars without even staying in the U.S. is nothing to brag
about, and that he’d rather not mention his experience again.</p>
<p>‘A full life at home’</p>
<p>At 33, Wang Zhongwei from China’s Anhui Province now lives in Los
Angeles, where has become a vocal advocate for immigrants since entering
the United States in May.</p>
<p>Many Chinese who have crossed the border or are attempting to do so
reach out to him for advice. Wang tells VOA Mandarin that while most who
make the journey across the border stay, there are those who return
because of loneliness, deceit, or family pressure.</p>
<p>Wang’s friend, Liu Ming, from Sichuan Province, came to the United
States in the second half of 2023. Liu, 31, first stayed in Los Angeles
for a month or two and then moved to New York to find work. After a long
wait, he found a job working for a Chinese boss, but the pay wasn’t
good.</p>
<p>In January, Liu’s boss refused to pay him, so he had no choice but to
call the police. After receiving his salary the following day, Liu
immediately went to the airport, messaging Wang: “I’m at the airport now
and about to go back to China. I don’t like it here. See you again if
destiny has it.”</p>
<p>In March, when Wang contacted him again, he found that Liu had used
the self-service kiosk when entering China and wasn’t even interviewed
by government staff.</p>
<p>Within months, Liu had returned to a life in China much as he knew it
before.</p>
<p>“I am now working in a restaurant in my hometown. I work eight hours
and the food is super good,” he told Wang via WhatsApp. “I used to work
12 hours non-stop in a restaurant in the U.S., [where] I was bored and
lonely … but I live a full life at home.</p>
<p>At one point, when he got sick in the U.S., he worried about dying in
a foreign land. He also complained about not being able to meet women
there.</p>
<p>“I don’t regret the trip to the U.S.,” Liu continued, allowing,
however, that on getting sick he’d worried about dying in a foreign
land, and that he’d found it difficult to meet women.</p>
<p>“What I saw in real life was different from what I saw online,” he
concluded. “There are both good and bad things in America.”</p>
<p>Room for regret</p>
<p>Zhang Lin, who is in his 30s and asked to use an alias to protect his
privacy, describes himself as a person of double regrets. He first
regretted coming to the United States, and now he regrets returning to
China.</p>
<p>Crossing the U.S. border, Zhang found a job as a massage therapist in
Los Angeles because he had the training. There, he made about $150 a
day, a substantial wage for an undocumented immigrant.</p>
<p>But after only a month he returned to China, where he now runs a foot
spa in his hometown.</p>
<p>“There were so many things I wasn’t used to in the U.S., and I was
lonely,” he said. “I felt very homesick, so I came back
impulsively.”</p>
<p>When he went to the U.S., Zhang said, he’d hoped to make a lot of
money and make his family the envy of his hometown neighbors.</p>
<p>But now, after returning to China, where he faced a 12-hour
interrogation at customs but faced no penalties, he says he regrets his
impulsive decision to return.</p>
<p>“Life in my hometown is really hopeless,” Zhang said, adding that he
hopes to go to the U.S. illegally again. “When you go out, you realize
that the outside world is different. Your mind is opened up.”</p>
<p>Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.</p>

adds driver to Windows that prevents changing the default browser using
the registry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>There are various ways you can change the default browser and similar
defaults on Windows, but oneof the ways many third-party tools do this
is by editing the relevant registry strings. It turns out that Microsoft
is not particularly happy with this, as they’ve recently introduced a
new driver specifically designed to prevent this from happening, by
blocking tools like regedit or PowerShell from editing a number of
registry keys for setting default applications. The driver was
discovered by Christoph Kolbicz. Microsoft implemented a driver based
protection to block changes to http/https and .pdf associations by 3rd
party utilities. The rollout was staggered and activated “randomly”, but
in the meantime I got many reports – also from business or education
environments (but not Server OS). Microsoft also updated the driver
during my tests (from 2.0 to 2.1) and extended the deny list of
executables. This means, they can change the behavior almost on the fly
and add new tricks or block additional extensions/protocols! ↫ Christoph
Kolbicz Digging further into what, exactly, this driver can do,
Microsoft also made it so that even if you disable the driver, an
additional scheduled task will run to re-enable the driver and revert
the registry changes. It also seems this is somehow related to the
changes Microsoft has to make to comply with the EU’s DMA, but the
driver is also installed on systems outside of the EU, so it’s all a bit
unclear at the moment.</p>

<em>Reuters</em>. In all three cases, the plaintiffs claim governments
breached their human rights by not protecting them from the damaging
health effects of climate change. The three cases are all quite
different: One involves a group of young people from Portugal, another
is from older Swiss women, and the third involves a former French mayor.
But “we all are trying to achieve the same goal,” said 23-year-old
Catarina Mota, one of the Portuguese youths. “A win in any one of the
three cases will be a win for everyone.” A ruling against even one
government could put added pressure on all European countries to
reconsider their emissions reductions schedules, and pave the way for
similar cases.

<li>New ‘Elmer’ book will focus on climate change
</h3>
<p>
The creator of the iconic children’s book character Elmer the patchwork
elephant was working on an Elmer book about climate change before he
died in 2022. Author David McKee left behind an early manuscript and
sketches of his book “Elmer + White Bear,” in which Elmer meets a polar
bear that has floated to the jungle a melting piece of ice. “I love
where I live,” the bear says, explaining that global warming is making
the world warmer and caused him to become lost in the jungle.

<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the funding for Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. means the company can expand on its
existing plans for two facilities in Phoenix and add a third, newly
announced production hub. </p>
<p>“These are the chips that underpin all artificial intelligence, and
they are the chips that are the necessary components for the
technologies that we need to underpin our economy,” Raimondo said on a
call with reporters, adding that they were vital to the “21st century
military and national security apparatus.” </p>
<p>The funding is tied to a sweeping 2022 law that President Joe Biden
has celebrated and which is designed to revive U.S. semiconductor
manufacturing. Known as the CHIPS and Science Act, the $280 billion
package is aimed at sharpening the U.S. edge in military technology and
manufacturing while minimizing the kinds of supply disruptions that
occurred in 2021, after the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when a
shortage of chips stalled factory assembly lines and fueled
inflation. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has promised tens of billions of dollars to
support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian
suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness. </p>
<p>“Semiconductors – those tiny chips smaller than the tip of your
finger – power everything from smartphones to cars to satellites and
weapons systems,” Biden said in a statement. “TSMC’s renewed commitment
to the United States, and its investment in Arizona represent a broader
story for semiconductor manufacturing that’s made in America and with
the strong support of America’s leading technology firms to build the
products we rely on every day.” </p>
<p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. produces nearly all of the
leading-edge microchips in the world and plans to eventually do so in
the U.S. </p>
<p>It began construction of its first facility in Phoenix in 2021, and
started work on a second hub last year, with the company increasing its
total investment in both projects to $40 billion. The third facility
should be producing microchips by the end of the decade and will see the
company’s commitment increase to a total of $65 billion, Raimondo
said. </p>
<p>The investments would put the U.S. on track to produce roughly 20% of
the world’s leading-edge chips by 2030, and Raimondo said they should
help create 6,000 manufacturing jobs and 20,000 construction jobs, as
well as thousands of new positions more indirectly tied to assorted
suppliers in chip-related industries tied to Arizona projects. </p>
<p>The potential incentives announced Monday include $50 million to help
train the workforce in Arizona to be better equipped to work in the new
facilities. Additionally, approximately $5 billion of proposed loans
would be available through the CHIPS and Science Act. </p>
<p>“TSMC’s commitment to manufacture leading-edge chips in Arizona marks
a new chapter for America’s semiconductor industry,” Lael Brainard,
director of the White House National Economic Council, told
reporters. </p>
<p>The announcement came as U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is
traveling in China. Senior administration officials were asked on the
call with reporters if the Biden administration gave China a head’s up
on the coming investment, given the delicate geopolitics surrounding
Taiwan. The officials said only that their focus in making Monday’s
announcement was solely on advancing U.S. manufacturing. </p>
<p>“We are thrilled by the progress of our Arizona site to date,” C.C.
Wei, CEO of TSMC, said in a statement, “And are committed to its
long-term success.”</p>

says US will not accept Chinese imports decimating new industries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIJING — U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned China on Monday
that Washington will not accept new industries being decimated by
Chinese imports as she wrapped up four days of meetings to press her
case for Beijing to rein in excess industrial capacity. </p>
<p>Yellen told a media conference that U.S. President Joe Biden would
not allow a repeat of the “China shock” of the early 2000s, when a flood
of Chinese imports destroyed about 2 million American manufacturing
jobs. </p>
<p>She did not, however, threaten new tariffs or other trade actions
should Beijing continue its massive state support for electric vehicles,
batteries, solar panels and other green energy goods. </p>
<p>Yellen used her second trip to China in nine months to complain that
China’s overinvestment has built factory capacity far exceeding domestic
demand, while fast-growing exports of these products threaten firms in
the U.S. and other countries. </p>
<p>She said a newly created exchange forum to discuss the excess
capacity issue would need time to reach solutions. </p>
<p>Yellen drew parallels to the pain felt in the U.S. steel sector in
the past. </p>
<p>“We’ve seen this story before,” she told reporters. “Over a decade
ago, massive PRC government support led to below-cost Chinese steel that
flooded the global market and decimated industries across the world and
in the United States.” </p>
<p>Yellen added: “I’ve made it clear that President Biden and I will not
accept that reality again.” </p>
<p>When the global market is flooded with artificially cheap Chinese
products, she said, “the viability of American and other foreign firms
is put into question.” </p>
<p>Yellen said her exchanges with Chinese officials had advanced
American interests and that U.S. concerns over excess industrial
capacity were shared by allies in Europe, Japan, Mexico, the Philippines
and other emerging markets. </p>
<p>Pushback </p>
<p>China’s parliament, the National People’s Congress, said in March the
government would take steps to curb industrial overcapacity. </p>
<p>But Beijing says the recent focus by the United States and Europe on
the risks to other economies from China’s excess capacity is
misguided. </p>
<p>Chinese officials say the criticism understates innovation by their
companies in key industries and overstates the importance of state
support in driving their growth. </p>
<p>They also say tariffs or other trade curbs will deprive global
consumers of green energy alternatives key to meeting global climate
goals. </p>
<p>Trade curbs on Chinese electric vehicles would be disruptive to a
growing industry and contravene World Trade Organization rules, the
industry and information technology ministry said in a statement carried
by state media CCTV and China Daily. </p>
<p>The ministry added that it was committed to support EV exports and
would help “accelerate the overseas development” of the industry
including planning for shipping and logistics and support for firms to
innovate and meet global standards. </p>
<p>State news agency Xinhua quoted Li as saying the U.S. should “refrain
from turning economic and trade issues into political or security
issues” and view the topic of production capacity from a
“market-oriented and global perspective.” </p>
<p>Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao voiced more pointed objections
during a roundtable meeting with Chinese EV makers in Paris, saying U.S.
and European assertions of Chinese excess EV capacity were
groundless. </p>
<p>Rather than subsidies, China’s electric vehicle companies rely on
continuous technological innovation, perfect production and supply chain
systems and full market competition, Wang said on his trip to discuss a
European Union anti-subsidy inquiry. </p>
<p>Yellen said a possible short-term solution was for China to take
steps to bolster consumer demand with support for households and
retirement, and shift its growth model away from supply-side
investments. </p>
<p>Yellen spoke about the issue at length with Premier Li Qiang and also
met Finance Minister Lan Foan on Sunday. She met People’s Bank of China
(PBOC) governor Pan Gongsheng and former vice premier Liu He on
Monday. </p>
<p>In a CNBC interview after the meetings, Yellen said she was “not
thinking so much” about trade curbs on China, as much as shifts in its
macroeconomic environment. But she reiterated she would notrule out
tariffs.</p>

This is a

<blockquote>
<p>
The email your manager received and forwarded to you was something
completely innocent, such as a potential customer asking a few
questions. All that email was supposed to achieve was being forwarded to

The innocent pretext disappeared and the real phishing email became
visible. A phishing email you <i>had</i> to trust because you knew the
sender and they even confirmed that they had forwarded it to you.
</p>
<p>
This attack is possible because most email clients allow CSS to be used
to style HTML emails. When an email is forwarded, the position of the
original email in the DOM usually changes, allowing for CSS rules to be
selectively applied only when an email has been forwarded…

<h2 id="huge-crowds-await-a-total-solar-eclipse-in-north-america">Huge
crowds await a total solar eclipse in North America</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MESQUITE, Texas — Millions of spectators along a narrow corridor
stretching from Mexico to the U.S. to Canada eagerly awaited Monday’s
celestial sensation — a total eclipse of the sun — even as forecasters
called for clouds.</p>
<p>The best weather was expected at the tail end of the eclipse in
Vermont and Maine, as well as New Brunswick and Newfoundland.</p>
<p>It promised to be North America’s biggest eclipse crowd ever, thanks
to the densely populated path and the lure of more than four minutes of
midday darkness in Texas and other choice spots. Almost everyone in
North America was guaranteed at least a partial eclipse, weather
permitting.</p>
<p>“Cloud cover is one of the trickier things to forecast,” National
Weather Service meteorologist Alexa Maines explained at Cleveland’s
Great Lakes Science Center on Sunday. “At the very least, it won’t
snow.”</p>
<p>The cliff-hanging uncertainty added to the drama. Rain or shine,
“it’s just about sharing the experience with other people,” said Chris
Lomas from Gotham, England, who was staying at a sold-out trailer resort
outside Dallas, the biggest city in totality’s path.</p>
<p>For Monday’s full eclipse, the moon was due to slip right in front of
the sun, entirely blocking it. The resulting twilight, with only the
sun’s outer atmosphere or corona visible, would be long enough for birds
and other animals to fall silent, and for planets, stars and maybe even
a comet to pop out.</p>
<p>The out-of-sync darkness lasts up to 4 minutes, 28 seconds. That’s
almost twice as long as it was during the U.S. coast-to-coast eclipse
seven years ago because the moon is closer to Earth. It will be another
21 years before the U.S. sees another total solar eclipse on this
scale.</p>
<p>Extending five hours from the first bite out of the sun to the last,
Monday’s eclipse begins in the Pacific and makes landfall at Mazatlan,
Mexico, before moving into Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and 12 other U.S.
states in the Midwest, Middle Atlantic and New England, and then Canada.
Last stop: Newfoundland, with the eclipse ending in the North
Atlantic.</p>
<p>It will take just 1 hour, 40 minutes for the moon’s shadow to race
more than 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometers) across the continent.</p>
<p>Eye protection is needed with proper eclipse glasses and filters to
look at the sun, except when it ducks completely out of sight during an
eclipse.</p>
<p>The path of totality — approximately 115 miles (185 kilometers) wide
— encompasses several major cities this time, including Dallas,
Indianapolis, Cleveland, Buffalo, New York and Montreal. An estimated 44
million people live within the track, with a couple hundred million more
within 200 miles (320 kilometers). Add in all the eclipse chasers,
amateur astronomers, scientists and just plain curious, and it’s no
wonder the hotels and flights are sold out and the roads jammed.</p>
<p>Experts from NASA and scores of universities are posted along the
route, poised to launch research rockets and weather balloons, and
conduct experiments. The International Space Station’s seven astronauts
also will be on the lookout, 270 miles (435 kilometers) up.</p>

abundance of game and trout, hot springs of five or six different
kinds…basaltic columns of enormous size” and a waterfall that must, they
wrote, “be in form, color and surroundings one of the most glorious

id="biden-to-talk-student-debt-relief-in-wisconsin-after-primary-voting-delivers-warning-signs">Biden
to talk student debt relief in Wisconsin after primary voting delivers
warning signs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is traveling to Wisconsin to
announce details of a new plan to ease student loan debt for millions, a
trip that comes a week after primary voting in the Midwest battleground
highlighted weaknesses for the Democratic president and Donald Trump,
his Republican challenger.</p>
<p>Biden is slated to make the announcement Monday in Madison, the
state’s liberal capital and home of the University of Wisconsin’s
flagship campus.</p>
<p>The new federal rule paving the way for student debt relief is not
expected to be issued by the time the president speaks, but Biden plans
to highlight a plan the Department of Education started working on after
the U.S. Supreme Court last year foiled his first attempt to forgive
hundreds of billions of dollars in student loan debt.</p>
<p>Immediately after the court said Biden needed Congress to approve his
original plan, the president said the decision was a “mistake” and
“wrong” and announced that Education Secretary Miguel Cardona would
undertake a new process using his authority under the Higher Education
Act to waive or compromise student loan debt in specific cases.</p>
<p>A fresh announcement on student loan relief, an important issue for
younger voters, could help energize parts of Biden’s political coalition
that have become disillusioned by his job performance. These are people
whose support the president will need to defeat Trump in November.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin’s primary elections on April 2, nearly 119,000
Republicans voted for a GOP candidate other than Trump, the party’s
presumptive nominee. And more than 48,000 Democratic voters chose
“uninstructed” instead of Biden, more than double Biden’s narrow margin
of victory in Wisconsin in 2020.</p>
<p>Nearly 15% of Democrats in Dane County, home to the University of
Wisconsin and Madison, voted “uninstructed.” That is nearly double the
statewide total of 8%.</p>
<p>Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who represents Madison in Congress,
said he was struck that concerns about Israel’s war against Hamas in
Gaza were top of mind among voters at five town halls over the past two
weeks in more rural parts of his district.</p>
<p>“I was surprised to see the intensity on the issue of Gaza coming not
from a student voice out of Madison, but older voters in more rural
parts of the district,” Pocan said.</p>
<p>Pocan said the number of “uninstructed” votes shows the concern in
Wisconsin and that Biden needs to address it. He said he planned to talk
directly with Biden about it on Monday.</p>
<p>“I just want to make sure he knows that if we’re going to have a
problem, that could be the problem in Wisconsin,” Pocan said.</p>
<p>Biden’s new plan would expand federal student loan relief to new
yet-targeted categories of borrowers through the Higher Education Act,
which administration officials believe puts it on a stronger legal
footing than the sweeping proposal that was killed by a 6-3 court
majority last year.</p>
<p>The plan is expected to be smaller and more targeted than his
original plan, which would have canceled up to $20,000 in loans for more
than 40 million borrowers.</p>
<p>The department laid out five categories of borrowers who would be
eligible to get some or all of their federal loans canceled. The plan is
focused on helping those with the greatest need, including many who
might otherwise never repay their loans.</p>
<p>Among those targeted for help are people whose unpaid interest has
snowballed beyond the size of the original loan. The proposal would
reset their balances back to the initial amount by erasing up to $10,000
or $20,000 in interest, depending on their income.</p>
<p>Borrowers paying down their student loans for decades would get all
remaining debt erased under the plan. Loans used for a borrower’s
undergraduate education would be canceled if they had been in repayment
for at least 20 years. For other types of federal loans, it’s 25
years.</p>
<p>The plan would automatically cancel loans for those who were in
for-profit college programs deemed “low-value.” Borrowers would be
eligible for cancellation if, while they attended the college, the
average federal student loan payment among graduates was too high in
relation to their average salary.</p>
<p>Those who are eligible for other types of cancellation but haven’t
applied would automatically get relief. It would apply to Public Service
Loan Forgiveness and Borrower Defense to Repayment, programs that have
been around for years but require infamously difficult paperwork.</p>
<p>Under pressure from advocates, the department also added a category
for those facing “hardship.” It would offer cancellation to borrowers
considered highly likely to be in default within two years. Additional
borrowers would be eligible for relief under a wide-ranging definition
of financial hardship.</p>
<p>A series of hearings to craft the rule wrapped up in February, and
the draft is now under review. Before it can be finalized, the Education
Department will need to issue a formal proposal and open it to a public
comment period.</p>
<p>The latest attempt at cancellation joins other targeted initiatives,
including those aimed at public service workers and low-income
borrowers. Through those efforts, the Biden administration says it has
canceled $144 billion in student loans for almost 4 million
Americans.</p>

<h2 id="the-shallows">The Shallows</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</p>
<p>
I didn’t read Nicholas Carr’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shallows_(book)">The
Shallows</a> when it came out in 2011. I was working as a software
engineer at the Library of Congress helping <a
href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov">put historical newspapers</a>
on the web, and felt indicted by the thesis of the book, which, it
seemed to me, boiled down to the idea that the Web was making us stupid.
I had built a career around web technology and I wasn’t interested in
reading anything that questioned whether the web was a net positive.
</p>
<p>
Recently, in light of all that’s going on with AI at the moment, and
<a href="https://inkdroid.org/2024/03/12/ai/">my</a> <a
href="https://inkdroid.org/2024/02/21/magic/">critical</a> <a
href="https://inkdroid.org/2023/06/04/copilot/">takes</a> on it, I
thought perhaps I had dismissed Carr’s book too quickly. Just how long
has this project been going on? Did Carr see where things were headed? I
mentioned the idea, and a few other people <a
href="https://social.coop/@edsu/111980705994284281">agreed</a> to do a
popup bookclub about it.
</p>
<p>
I’m glad I did get around to reading it finally. I got Carr wrong, he
was (is?) a fan of the web, just like I was at the time. But noticing a
decline in his ability to focus for long periods prompted him to
research and write The Shallows. He draws on the history of the book,
media studies and the history of technology more generally to illustrate
how technologies like clocks, maps, writing, and the book shaped how we
remember and thought itself. In the second half of the book he talks
about the development of universal machines (the computer) have absorbed
prior media into the web using hypermedia. He also brings in neurology
and psychology research literature to explain how different phases of
memory formation are disturbed by rapid attention shifts that browsing
the web encourages:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Web provides a convenient and compelling supplement to personal
memory, but when we start using the Web as a substitute for personal
memory, bypassing the inner processes of consolidation, we risk emptying
our minds of their riches. <span class="citation"
data-cites="Carr:2011">(<a href="#ref-Carr:2011"
role="doc-biblioref">Carr, 2011, p. 192</a>)</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I thought this line of critique was especially interesting in light of
the recent popularization of AI in the form of “chatting” with Large
Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT. ChatGPT provides a smooth surface
where you conversationally interact with a computer to obtain
information. It doesn’t given you links to things on the web to consult,
it just gives you a response, and you either continue the discussion, or
decide to stop. You don’t see a list of search results, which you need
to click on and move laterally into, perhaps with distracting web
design, ads or other boilerplate. You don’t need to read the linked
documents. You just read the AI’s response. Much to my dismay, it seemed
like perhaps the affordances of ChatGPT style interaction may not
present the same problems as classic web navigation, at least in terms
of distractions that lead to quick context shifts, and disturb our
ability to form memories. I imagine there are hordes of education and
pyschology looking into this as a type.
</p>
<p>
It was bit surreal reading the detailed descriptions in the final
chapters about how neurons store memories through repetitive training …
which echo the same language that is used to talk about deep learning
today. These are powerful metaphors that have been deployed. Almost
anticipating recent developments in AI, Carr ends the book talking about
the goals of classic AI, and specifically the warnings of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum">Joseph
Weizenbaum</a> in his book <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Power_and_Human_Reason">Computer
Power and Human Reason</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What Makes us most human, Weizenbaum had come to believe, is what is
least computable about us–the connections between our mind and our body,
the experiences that shape our memory and our thinking, our capacity for
emotion and empathy. The great danger we face as we become more
intimately involved with our computers–as we come to experience more of
our lives through the disembodied symbols flickering across our
screens–is that we’ll begin to lose our humanness, to sacrifice the very
qualities that separate us from machines. The only way to avoid that
fate, Weizenbaum wrote, is to have the self-awareness and the courage to
refuse to delegate to computers the most human of our mental activities
and intellectual pursuits, particularly “tasks that demand wisdom”.
<span class="citation" data-cites="Carr:2011">(<a href="#ref-Carr:2011"
role="doc-biblioref">Carr, 2011, pp. 207–208</a>)</span>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Weizenbaum was the creator the original chatbot <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a>. I didn’t realize
that his experience of seeing how ELIZA was used prompted him to
critique the goals of Artificial Intelligence community. Maybe it’s not
surprising because according to Carr Weizenbaum’s book was trashed by
leaders in the computer science community at the time. Perhaps digging
up a copy of Weizenbaum’s book might be interesting reading in light of
AI’s resurgence now.
</p>
<p>
The Shallows had lots of citations to current states of affairs,
demographics and statistics that gave authority to Carr’s arguments. But
these got a little bit repetitive at times, but the drudgery drives the
points home I guess. It is striking reading it 13 years later how much
the web has changed.
</p>
<p>
In discussing the technologies of literacy and the book I felt a little
bit like Carr’s would have benefited at looking at the book and literacy
as instruments of power, that mobilized colonialism and capitalist
extraction. I found myself thinking a lot about Bernard Stiegler while
reading The Shallows, especially for the idea that writing and
computational devices are memory prostheses, and that they are a
pharmakon (contain both a remedy and a poison). A quick Kagi search and
I can see Stiegler had a <a
href="https://terenceblake.wordpress.com/2012/06/24/translations-of-bernard-stieglers-seminar/">sequence
of lectures</a> about Carr. So I guess they knew of each other?
</p>
<p>
Overall I enjoyed The Shallows, even though I’m still working as a web
developer. Nowadays I’m explicitly interested in the web’s role in
memory practices, and what can be done from an architecture and design
perspective to work against the grain of the web’s most pernicious
features. There are some good threads to tug on in The Shallows.

<p>Great map of Total Solar Eclipse of 2024 Apr 08. I've been looking
for this for weeks. I still wasn't going to drive to see the eclipse.
I've seen a total eclipse. Imho its not magical. We have an eclipse
every night at sunset. YMMV of course.</p>

Because English isn’t the only language

Korean web giant Naver last week debuted a family of large language
models named HyperCLOVA X, which it claimed perform better at
cross-lingual reasoning in Asian languages than other models – and may
therefore help the region to develop sovereign large language models.…

<h2 id="different-kinds-of-networks">Different kinds of networks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Somewhat-related notes about different kinds of networks, ActivityPub
and RSS, various twitter-like systems, as the social web spreads out and
tries out new ideas.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/07/word.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">With
ActivityPub you know who’s following you and in RSS you don’t. This may
sound like a negative until you think about it from the user’s
standpoint: no spam, spyware, etc. Which is probably why Google didn’t
like RSS btw.
</li>
<li>
It has been
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@dusoft@fosstodon.org/112230502776773193">pointed
out</a> that some level of spying happens based on IP address, and I can
testify to that, I get podcasts with ads for a local supermarket, kind
of spooky but I guess ok. I can’t recall ever receiving spam as a result
of subscribing to a feed, and I never get messages from them when I
unsub begging me to come back. So it isn’t a huge problem in a real way
at least for me, yet.
</li>
<li>
I block spammers. In twitter-like systems, like Mastodon, spam means you
attached a post to my post that is in no way responsive to it. You’re
just trying to coast on the flow generated by other posts. I don’t abide
that. Have a nice day.

id="south-carolina-finishes-perfect-season-with-ncaa-championship-beating-iowa-87-75">South
Carolina finishes perfect season with NCAA championship, beating Iowa,
87-75</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CLEVELAND — Kamilla Cardoso delivered once again for Dawn Staley and
South Carolina.</p>
<p>A perfect finish. A dynasty. A team too big for Caitlin Clark and
Iowa this time around.</p>
<p>Cardoso had 15 points and a career-high 17 rebounds, and South
Carolina completed its perfect season with an 87-75 victory over Clark
and the Hawkeyes in the NCAA championship game on Sunday.</p>
<p>With Staley directing a relentless attack from the sideline, the
Gamecocks (38-0) became the 10th Division I team to go through a season
without a loss. And they accomplished the feat after they lost all five
starters from last season’s team that lost to Clark’s squad in the
national semifinals.</p>
<p>“When young people lock in and have a belief, and have a trust, and
their parents have that same trust, this is what can happen,” Staley
said. “They made history. They etched their names in the history
books.”</p>
<p>Clark did all she could to lead the Hawkeyes to their first
championship. She scored 30 points, including a championship-record 18
in the first quarter. She rewrote the record book at Iowa (34-5),
finishing as the career leading scorer in NCAA Division I history with
3,951 points.</p>
<p>She hopes her legacy isn’t defined by falling short in two NCAA
championship games, but more by the millions of new fans she helped
bring into the game and the countless young girls and boys that she
inspired.</p>
<p>“I think the biggest thing is it’s really hard to win these things, I
think I know that better than most people by now, to be so close twice
really hurts,” Clark said.</p>
<p>As the final buzzer sounded, a stoic Clark walked off the court,
through the confetti, and into the tunnel heading to the locker
room.</p>
<p>“I personally want to thank Caitlin Clark for lifting up our sport.
She carried a heavy load for our sport,” Staley said. “She’s going to
lift that league (WNBA) up as well. Caitlin Clark if you’re out there,
you’re one of the GOATs of our game. We appreciate you.”</p>
<p>South Carolina has won three titles in the last eight years,
including two of the past three, to lay claim to being the latest
dynasty in women’s basketball. Staley became the fifth coach to win at
least three national championships, joining Geno Auriemma, Pat Summitt,
Kim Mulkey and Tara VanDerveer.</p>
<p>The Gamecocks, who have won 109 of their last 112 games, became the
first team since UConn in 2016 to go undefeated. South Carolina had a
couple scares throughout the season, but always found a way to win.</p>
<p>With most of the team returning next year, Staley’s team is in a good
position to keep this run going.</p>
<p>“This team, we’re going to be good. Coach Staley, we have the best
coach, what, in the country, in the nation, in the whole wide world?”
Raven Johnson said. “It’s no telling what she’s going to add to the
pieces that’s already here. I just say be on the lookout.”</p>
<p>Tessa Johnson led South Carolina with 19 points. Cardoso, the Final
Four’s Most Outstanding Player, also blocked three shots.</p>
<p>“Kamilla Cardoso was not going to let us lose a game in the NCAA
Tournament,” Staley said. “She played through an injury, she played like
one of the top picks in the WNBA draft, and her teammates did something
that no teammates have done for somebody who went to the WNBA in our
program. They send her off as a national champion. So this is history
for us.”</p>
<p>Led by the 6-foot-7 Cardoso and Ashlyn Watkins, South Carolina
enjoyed a 51-29 rebounding advantage. It also finished with 30
second-chance points.</p>
<p>The Gamecocks also showed off their impressive depth. Tessa Johnson
helped the team to a 37-0 difference in points by reserves.</p>
<p>South Carolina trailed 46-44 late in the second quarter before going
on an 11-0 run spanning halftime to open a 55-46 advantage early in the
third quarter. Clark finally ended the run with a layup.</p>
<p>The Hawkeyes closed to 59-55 and had a chance to get even closer, but
Hannah Stuelke missed a wide-open layup on a brilliant pass from
Clark.</p>
<p>South Carolina responded with the next eight points, including two
3-pointers. The Gamecocks, who were 4 for 20 from behind the 3-point
line during last season’s Final Four loss to Iowa, went 8 for 19 from
deep against the Hawkeyes in the victory.</p>
<p>Iowa was down 80-75 after a three-point play by Sydney Affolter with
4:12 left. But the Hawkeyes were shut out the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Clark checked out with 20 seconds left when Iowa coach Lisa Bluder
subbed in fellow senior Molly Davis, who hadn’t played since she got
hurt in the regular-season finale against Ohio State.</p>
<p>Unlike the semifinals, when Clark struggled against UConn’s defense,
she got going early against South Carolina. Clark scored 13 straight
points, including another logo 3, for Iowa as the Hawkeyes were up 11
early. South Carolina cut it to 22-20 with 1:30 left in the period
before Clark scored the final five points, including a 3-pointer over
Cardoso.</p>
<p>Clark’s 18 points in the opening quarter set a championship game
record, surpassing the 16 that Jasmine Carson of LSU had last year
against the Hawkeyes.</p>
<p>The Gamecocks trailed 46-44 in the final minute when Te-Hina PaoPao
hit a 3-pointer and Raven Johnson stole the ball from Clark near
midcourt and went in for a layup. South Carolina led 49-46 at the
half.</p>

Boeing 737-800 loses engine cover, prompts FAA probe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An engine cover on a Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-800
fell off Sunday during takeoff in Denver and struck the wing flap,
prompting the U.S. FAA to open an investigation.</p>
<p>No one was injured and Southwest Flight 3695 returned safely to
Denver International Airport around 8:15 a.m. local time Sunday and was
towed to the gate after losing the engine cowling.</p>
<p>The Boeing aircraft bound for Houston Hobby airport with 135
passengers and six crew members aboard rose to an elevation of about
3,140 meters (10,300 feet) before returning 25 minutes after
takeoff.</p>
<p>Passengers arrived in Houston on another Southwest plane about four
hours behind schedule. Southwest said maintenance teams are reviewing
the aircraft.</p>
<p>The plane entered service in June 2015, according to FAA records.
Boeing referred questions to Southwest.</p>
<p>The airline declined to say when the plane’s engine last had
maintenance.</p>
<p>ABC News aired a video posted on social media platform X of the
ripped engine cover flapping in the wind with a torn Southwest logo.</p>
<p>Boeing has come under intense criticism since a door plug panel tore
off a new Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 jet at about 4.88 kilometers (16,000
feet) on Jan. 5.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of that incident, the FAA grounded the MAX 9 for
several weeks, barred Boeing from increasing the MAX production rate and
ordered it to develop a comprehensive plan to address “systemic
quality-control issues” within 90 days.</p>
<p>Boeing production has fallen below the maximum 38 MAX planes per
month the FAA is allowing. The Justice Department has opened a criminal
investigation into the MAX 9 incident.</p>
<p>The 737-800 is in the prior generation of the best-selling 737 known
as the 737 NG, which in turn was replaced by the 737 MAX.</p>
<p>The FAA is investigating several other recent Southwest Boeing engine
issues.</p>
<p>A Southwest 737 flight aborted takeoff Thursday and taxied back to
the gate at Lubbock airport in Texas after the crew reported engine
issues. The FAA is also investigating a March 25 Southwest 737 flight
that returned to the Austin airport in Texas after the crew reported a
possible engine issue.</p>
<p>A March 22 Southwest 737-800 flight returned to Fort Lauderdale
airport after the crew reported an engine issue. It is also being
reviewed by the FAA.</p>
