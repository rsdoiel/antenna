## The No-Win 'Mystery Drone' Clusterfuck

To political grifters boosting their profiles, government inaction is unacceptable, and government action cannot be trusted. There is no acceptable explanation.

## OpenAI WebRTC Audio demo

date: 2024-12-17, updated: 2024-12-17, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/openai-webrtc">OpenAI WebRTC Audio demo</a></strong></p>
OpenAI announced <a href="https://openai.com/index/o1-and-new-tools-for-developers/">a bunch of API features</a> today, including a brand new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc">WebRTC API</a> for setting up a two-way audio conversation with their models.</p>
<p>They <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenAIDevs/status/1869116585044259059">tweeted this opaque code example</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>async function createRealtimeSession(inStream, outEl, token) {
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();
pc.ontrack = e =&gt; outEl.srcObject = e.streams[0];
pc.addTrack(inStream.getTracks()[0]);
const offer = await pc.createOffer();
await pc.setLocalDescription(offer);
const headers = { Authorization: <code>Bearer ${token}</code>, 'Content-Type': 'application/sdp' };
const opts = { method: 'POST', body: offer.sdp, headers };
const resp = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime', opts);
await pc.setRemoteDescription({ type: 'answer', sdp: await resp.text() });
return pc;
}</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/69151091f7672adb9b42f5b17bd45d44">pasted that into Claude</a> and had it build me <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/openai-webrtc">this interactive demo</a> for trying out the new API.</p>
<div style="max-width: 100%; margin: 1em 0">
    <video 
        controls 
        preload="none"
        poster="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/webrtc-demo.jpg" loop
        style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <source src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/webrtc-demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
</div>

<p>My demo uses an OpenAI key directly, but the most interesting aspect of the new WebRTC mechanism is its support for <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc#creating-an-ephemeral-token">ephemeral tokens</a>.</p>
<p>This solves a major problem with their previous realtime API: in order to connect to their endpoint you need to provide an API key, but that meant making that key visible to anyone who uses your application. The only secure way to handle this was to roll a full server-side proxy for their WebSocket API, just so you could hide your API key in your own server. <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/openai-workers-relay">cloudflare/openai-workers-relay</a> is an example implementation of that pattern.</p>
<p>Ephemeral tokens solve that by letting you make a server-side call to request an ephemeral token which will only allow a connection to be initiated to their WebRTC endpoint for the next 60 seconds. The user's browser then starts the connection, which will last for up to 30 minutes.

## RSoC 2024: Progress Report - Dynamic Linker

date: 2024-12-17, from: Redox OS News

Hello everyone! I am Anhad Singh and I am currently working on Redox’s dynamic linker and porting programs to be dynamically linked as a part of my RsoC project.
At the time of writing this post, all upstream recipes currently are statically compiled and patches are being gradually rolled out.
Basically, dynamic linking allows a program to use external symbols, such as those in shared libraries like libc, without actually including them in the program&rsquo;s executable.
