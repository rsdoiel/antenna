to meet Zelenskyy amid tension, Republican criticism of Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Former President Donald Trump is set to meet with
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York on Friday, amid
increased skepticism of U.S. support for Ukraine’s war efforts from the
Republican presidential nominee and lawmakers loyal to him.</p>
<p>Trump announced the meeting at a press conference Thursday, which was
confirmed for VOA by Zelenskyy’s team. The meeting comes a day after the
Ukrainian leader met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala
Harris Thursday to discuss U.S. support for the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Tension has been brewing between the two leaders. Trump is known for
his skeptical remarks on U.S. involvement in Ukraine and claims that he
can quickly end the conflict by making a deal between Ukraine and
Russia, if elected.</p>
<p>During a campaign event on Wednesday, Trump slammed Zelenskyy for
making “little, nasty aspersions” toward him. He appeared to be
referring to Zelenskyy’s comments in a recent New Yorker magazine
article that Trump “doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he
might think he knows how.”</p>
<p>Trump suggested the Ukrainian leader together with the Biden
administration are at fault for prolonging the war that followed
Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>“Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money
and munitions like no country has ever seen before,” Trump said in North
Carolina. He argued that Kyiv should have made concessions to Moscow
before Russian troops attacked, asserting that Ukraine is now “in
rubble” and in no position to negotiate the war’s end.</p>
<p>“Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have
now,” said Trump.</p>
<p>The former U.S. president has repeatedly said he wants the
Russia-Ukraine war to end but has not stated whether he wants Kyiv to
win or keep all its territories. His position stands in contrast with
that of Biden and Harris, who have championed American aid and military
support for the embattled country.</p>
<p>“Ukraine will prevail, and we’ll continue to stand by you every step
of the way,” Biden said Thursday as he met with Zelenskyy at the White
House.</p>
<p>During her meeting with Zelenskyy, Harris, the Democratic
presidential nominee, reiterated the administration’s support for Kyiv’s
war efforts and underscored that it is up to Ukraine to decide how the
war will end.</p>
<p>Without mentioning his name, Harris criticized Republican
vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, whose proposal to end the war would
mean Ukraine had less territory and would not join NATO.</p>
<p>“These proposals are the same of those of Putin, and let us be clear,
they are not proposals for peace,” she said. “Instead, they are
proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.”</p>
<p>Vance suggested in a recent interview that Ukraine and Russia halt
fighting and create a demilitarized zone at the current battle lines.
Kyiv would need to adhere to a neutral status and stop its bid to join
NATO.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy, in the same New Yorker interview, said that Vance’s plan
would “give up” Ukrainian territory, calling Trump’s running mate “too
radical.”</p>
<p>“His message seems to be that Ukraine must make a sacrifice,” he
said. “The idea that the world should end this war at Ukraine’s expense
is unacceptable.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy, who has been in the United States since Sunday to attend
the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was scheduled to depart
Thursday but extended his visit as Trump announced the meeting.</p>
<p>Partisan politics</p>
<p>On Wednesday, congressional Republicans loyal to Trump demanded that
the Ukrainian leader fire his ambassador to the United States, Oksana
Markarova, for organizing Zelenskyy’s visit earlier this week to an
ammunition factory in Pennsylvania, a hotly contested battleground state
in the November U.S. presidential election. Zelenskyy met with the
Democratic governor of the state, Josh Shapiro.</p>
<p>In a letter to Zelenskyy, Republican House of Representatives Speaker
Mike Johnson said the visit to the factory that made munitions for
Ukraine was a “partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats” that
amounts to “election interference.”</p>
<p>The White House called Johnson’s letter a “political stunt” and
pointed out that Zelenskyy recently met the Republican governor of Utah,
Spencer Cox, in a “similar event.”</p>
<p>Ahead of Zelenskyy’s visit, the U.S. administration announced $8
billion in new aid for Ukraine. In a statement, Biden said the aid
includes a Patriot missile battery and missiles, as well as
air-to-ground munitions and a precision-guided glide bomb with a range
of up to 130 kilometers.</p>
<p>The White House said no announcement was imminent regarding Ukraine’s
request for weapons donors to allow Ukrainian forces to use the weapons
to strike targets deeper inside Russia.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
I spoke with Kristen Siemen, General Motors’ chief sustainability
officer, as her fellow Michiganders were reeling from another late
summer day of violent thunderstorms, extreme summer heat, tornado and
hail warnings, school closings, and damaging wind gusts
<a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2024/08/27/heat-advisory-southeast-michigan-storms-tornadoes-hail/74962649007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>that

<p>
In the race against climate change, Siemen feels the pressure for GM to
reach its goal to be carbon neutral in its products and operations by
2040, despite lowering its production target for electric vehicles this
year to

EVs next year</u></a>. The 31-year GM veteran started her career as an
engineer.
</p>
<p>
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How bad was last night?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I was texting all night and into this morning, checking in on my staff
and whether they have power at their homes and whether we’re able to
operate our facilities. Unfortunately, these big storms are happening
more and more frequently and it’s getting harder for our grid to
reliably and consistently provide energy for all of the things we’re
trying to do. And this isn’t just a U.S. problem.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How worried are you about the idea that there’s a slowdown in EV
sales?</strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s no doubt that the acceleration has not happened as quickly as
was predicted. But that doesn’t mean that the EV segment isn’t growing.
It’s still a huge growth opportunity. We’ve got a lot of products
covering a lot of segments that weren’t available before, everything
from the affordable Equinox EV to full-size trucks with the Silverado
and a luxury vehicle with the Cadillac Lyric. And obviously the
supertruck Hummer.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Which new EV model do you think will do the best?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have two favorites and I’ve driven them all. I actually was in the
Cadillac Lyric for quite a while, and it’s, by far, the best vehicle
I’ve ever driven, based on performance and luxury features. Just
absolutely loved the product.
</p>
<p>
And then the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chevy-equinox-ev" target="_self"><u>Equinox
EV</u></a>. To get a family sized SUV that starts at $35,000 and you add
in the tax incentives, you’re talking under $30,000 for an EV for a
family. That’s a game changer, to be able to have something that’s
affordable. It’s a fantastic product with incredible range, great
performance, and all the features that you can imagine. These are the
things that will really open the doors for people that maybe couldn’t or
weren’t considering an EV in the past.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What else do you worry about?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I worry about the stability of our country’s infrastructure,
particularly the grid. We need to more reliably and consistently provide
energy for all of the things we’re trying to do to make the energy
transition a reality. And we have a long way to go.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What about a lack of EV charging infrastructure?</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you go on a long road trip and you drive through areas that don’t
have public EV charging stations, it’s a little unnerving. People need
to see more charging stations in their daily lives — like we’re used to
seeing a gas station on every corner. The more people that can see that
EV charging stations are readily available, even though they probably
will use one rarely, they just want to know it’s there. It gives that
sense of comfort that it’s available. And charging at home isn’t
feasible for everybody, particularly in urban areas. So it’s going to be
important to see that our customers see more charging infrastructure
when they are out and about.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How are you feeling about Plug-In Hybrids (PHEVs)?</strong>
</p>
<p>
As long as consumers have concerns over the charging infrastructure,
PHEVs are going to help bridge that gap for customers that either aren’t
ready or aren’t able to make the full transition to an EV. But from a
chief sustainability officer’s perspective, the only way we get to zero
is by charging with green energy. And so we want that transition to
happen as quickly as it possibly can.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What did GM learn from its Bolt experience and what do you
expect from the new Bolt due out in late 2025?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The Bolt was a terrific product. And the customer base was extremely
passionate, extremely loyal, and probably the highest customer
satisfaction score of some vehicles ever, not just at GM. So for the new
Bolt, we’re going to build on that equity and that passion that we’ve
had and do it as efficiently as possible.
</p>
<p>
We really needed to transition, and that’s what we’re doing. The new
Bolt EV will be on the new Ultium battery platform, and so it’ll be
profitable and an affordable EV. We heard a lot from Bolt customers and
that passion is certainly something that drives us.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Any advice for all the sustainability executives out here who
are having a hard time getting traction within their companies?</strong>
</p>
<p>
When I first got the phone call to take this role, my first question
was, why me? You know, I don’t have a sustainability background, I’m not
sure what I can contribute.
</p>
<p>
But in reality, knowing the business has been a huge advantage to be
able to communicate and understand all the challenges to being a chief
sustainability officer. I know how long it takes to put a product into
production. I know all of the things that an engineer needs to balance
around cost and quality and performance.
</p>
<p>
So I tell other CSOs to meet [their C-suite colleagues and stakeholders]
where they’re at. Talk to the CEO about how making the company more
sustainable means making the company more resilient and stronger for the
future, ensuring that we have a positive impact on the world. Educate
the CFO on how all this saves money. When you look at the things we’re
doing from an environmental or health and safety standpoint, they’re
just good for people. It’s about doing the right thing. So it doesn’t
even have to be a debate over climate change, right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does that dynamic work within GM?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Saving energy, saving water, those save costs. And there isn’t anybody
who disagrees with saving costs.
</p>
<p>
Now, there are some things that we may want to do today, but we just
can’t justify it. Some of our largest challenges are in our assembly
plants, around things like heating and cooling and with our paint ovens.
Even if we had the capital, or wanted to allocate the capital, to make
those transitions today to electric, it really doesn’t make sense in
every case, because natural gas is really cheap.
</p>
<p>
And so we need to focus instead on, how do we make what we do more
efficient? How do we use less resources? How do we continue to make our
manufacturing processes more efficient and make sure that we’re
allocating our resources, our capital, our investments in the places
that we can make the biggest impact today? And then prepare ourselves
for when this transition is more readily available.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What other companies do you admire for their work in
sustainability?</strong>
</p>
<p>
One of the things I love about this job is really the collaboration. The
CSO space is a very friendly space. We’re all trying to work on the same
issues, right? It’s a very unique situation where you all have the same
challenges, regardless of what your company does, and so it’s extremely
collaborative.
</p>
<p>
There are a lot of companies just doing incredible work in
sustainability. I’ve spent time recently with the CSO of
Colgate-Palmolive and one of their big wins this year was developing a
recyclable toothpaste tube. What’s really cool about their story is that
they made [their IP] available for everyone. We’ve also had
conversations with Nike and Lululemon around materials. It’s a good
opportunity for us to come up with solutions together. And we’re working
with the tech companies too, Google, Amazon, Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
Partnering with NGOs has also been helpful, working on everything from
how to purchase renewable energy, including virtual power plants, and
how you take advantage of all those EVs out there that can help generate
power for days like today when so many people have lost power.

Ukraine war enters a critical period, the EU moves ahead without the
US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BRUSSELS — s the war in Ukraine enters a critical period, the
European Union has decided that it must take responsibility for what it
sees as an existential threat to security in its own neighborhood and is
preparing to tackle some of the financial burden, perhaps even without
the United States.</p>
<p>EU envoys have been working in Brussels this week on a proposal to
provide Ukraine with a hefty loan package worth up to $39 billion. It
was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen
during a trip to Kyiv last Friday.</p>
<p>“Crucially, this loan will flow straight into your national budget,”
she told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “It will provide you with
significant and much-needed fiscal space. You will decide how best to
use the funds, giving you maximum flexibility to meet your needs.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy wants to buy weapons and bomb shelters and rebuild
Ukraine’s shattered energy network as winter draws near.</p>
<p>In international matters, particularly involving major conflicts, the
EU rarely moves ahead without the U.S., but it hopes this decision will
encourage others to come forward.</p>
<p>Russian troops and an election close in</p>
<p>Almost 1,000 days since their full-scale invasion, Russian forces are
making advances in the east. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of
the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost,
but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned.</p>
<p>On the political front, Zelenskyy hopes to secure support for a
“victory plan” that might force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the
negotiating table. He’s trying to persuade U.S. President Joe Biden and
other allies to help strengthen Ukraine’s hand in any future talks.</p>
<p>But a U.S. election looms, and polls suggest that Donald Trump might
return to the White House in January. Trump has been critical of U.S.
aid to Ukraine. On Wednesday, he said Zelenskyy should have made
concessions to Putin before the invasion began in February 2022.</p>
<p>Most of the 27-nation EU fears that a Putin victory would lead to
deep uncertainty. Russia’s armed forces are depleted and currently
incapable of another war, but the prospect of a future land grab in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland remains.</p>
<p>Reworking a G7 loan plan</p>
<p>The EU loans are part of a plan by the Group of Seven major
industrialized nations to take advantage of interest earned on about
$250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets, most of them held in
Europe. These windfall profits are estimated at around $5 billion to $6
billion a year.</p>
<p>The profits underpin the G7 plan. The EU would stump up $20 billion,
the U.S. $20 billion, and Canada, Japan and the U.K. $10 billion
together, for a combined total of $50 billion. The scheme expires at the
end of the year, before the next U.S. president takes office.</p>
<p>Now, amid differences over how long the Russian asset freeze should
be guaranteed, the EU has decided to go it alone. Its offer of up to $39
billion in loans accounts for almost the entirety of the U.S. share as
well.</p>
<p>The U.S. wants to ensure that the assets are locked away for at least
three years to guarantee the income. But EU member Hungary insists this
should only happen in 6-month increments. Hungarian Prime Minister
Viktor Orbán styles himself as a peacemaker and is too close to Putin
for many of his partners’ comfort.</p>
<p>The other 26 EU countries feel they must move now because time is
running out.</p>
<p>Evolving alliance with the United States</p>
<p>The U.S. election is just weeks away. The Europeans are wary of
Trump’s unpredictability and are testing scenarios to help protect
themselves from the kind of battering, like tariff hikes, their
economies received during his past presidency. But they also see the
Democrats as more inward looking these days.</p>
<p>Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act left European leaders fuming over
rules that favored American products. China and war in the Middle East
are the foreign policy priorities of Democrat or Republican candidates
alike, and for now the U.S. is in the grip of election campaign
fever.</p>
<p>The EU hopes that Vice President Kamala Harris, if she is elected
president, would enter the loan program as previously planned and reduce
the EU’s financial burden. But that remains an open question for now,
and EU members say Ukraine’s position is too precarious to hesitate.</p>
<p>Political delays in the U.S. Congress last year over a $60 billion
support package starved Ukrainian troops of weapons and ammunition for
months, resulting in “real consequences on the battlefield,” in the
words of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.</p>
<p>Pressing ahead on pressing needs</p>
<p>Helping Ukraine in military terms is a challenge for the Europeans.
They could not do it alone, and cannot match the U.S. transport,
logistics and equipment superiority, despite progress in ramping up
their defense industries to supply arms and ammunition.</p>
<p>But the world’s biggest trading bloc does wield economic might. It
has already given Ukraine about $132 billion since the full-scale
invasion started. Within weeks it appears ready to provide tens of
billions more, even though going it alone is not in the EU’s DNA.</p>
<p>“I do not know what the Americans, the United States with the new
presidency, will do or not,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said
on Tuesday. But, he said, “as long as the Ukrainians want to resist, we
have to support them. Otherwise, we will make a historical mistake.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration did announce Wednesday that the U.S. will
send Ukraine a major military aid package, including cluster bombs and
an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles. A U.S. official
also said billions of dollars more in assistance would arrive over the
coming months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, deliberations on the EU’s share of the G7 loan package
will be high on the agenda of a summit of the bloc’s leaders in Brussels
on October 17-18.</p>

<p>
President Biden just signed a bill to fund the government for the next
three months, but extra money for the federal government’s disaster
management agency, FEMA, was not in the legislation. A look at why the
agency was asking for more funds and how fewer resources can impact
communities recovering from disasters. The labor dispute between some of
the largest U.S. ports and dockworkers escalated Friday, with employers

reiterated that she is not against fracking, and has called for
investing in “diverse sources of energy,” but hasn’t said much more on
the issue yet. President Biden paused approvals for new liquified
natural gas export terminals while the Energy Department studied their
climate effects, a move that angered the industry but pleased climate
activists who say the terminals lock in greenhouse gas pollution for
decades to come. A judge has since blocked the freeze, but new approvals
remain slow. Pennsylvania is a major natural gas producing state, and a

Trump has promised to lift the permitting freeze if elected in November.

that oil and gas operations account for around 15% of global
energy-related emissions. It calls for a 50% reduction in emissions
intensity for those operations by the end of the decade to align with a
planway toward net zero by 2050, and electrification is one step on that
path. But the IEA notes that “tackling methane emissions is the single
most important measure that contributes to the overall fall in emissions
from oil and gas operations.”

id="trump-and-zelenskyy-will-meet-as-tensions-rise-over-us-backing-for-ukraine">Trump
and Zelenskyy will meet as tensions rise over US backing for
Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy as public tensions have been rising between the two
over Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion. </p>
<p>Trump said Zelenskyy asked for the meeting. The visit is set for
about 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time at Trump Tower in New York, less than a day
after Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent, met
with the Ukrainian leader and expressed unwavering support. </p>
<p>“I look forward to seeing him tomorrow,” Trump said in a press
conference Thursday. “I believe I will be able to make a deal between
President [Vladimir] Putin and President Zelenskyy, quite quickly.” </p>
<p>The meeting is highly anticipated and comes as Election Day nears,
with Trump and Harris taking sharply different positions on backing
Ukraine in the third year of its war with Russia. </p>
<p>Trump argues Putin would never have invaded had he been president
while derisively calling Zelenskyy a “salesman” for getting U.S.
assistance for Ukraine. Trump has in recent days praised Russia’s
historic military victories and insisted the U.S. needs “to get out” and
end its involvement with Ukraine. </p>
<p>Friday’s meeting almost wasn’t scheduled despite Zelenskyy’s office
saying something had been planned during the Ukrainian leader’s visit to
the U.N. General Assembly, during which he is making his endgame pitch
to allies. </p>
<p>In an interview with The New Yorker magazine that was published
earlier this week, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and
oversimplifies the conflict. The Ukrainian leader said Trump’s running
mate JD Vance was “too radical” and had essentially advocated for
Ukraine to “make a sacrifice” by “giving up its territories.” </p>
<p>Trump ripped Zelenskyy and Ukraine on two separate occasions this
week. Speaking Wednesday in North Carolina, Trump referred to Ukraine as
“demolished” and its people as “dead.” </p>
<p>“Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have
now,” Trump said. “If they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much
better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be
living, and every building would be built and every tower would be aging
for another 2,000 years.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Harris on Thursday stood alongside Zelenskyy and said
Trump’s push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war were “not
proposals for peace,” but “proposals for surrender.” Trump on Thursday
said he was not advocating for a surrender. </p>
<p>While Trump and Vance have long been skeptics of U.S. backing for
Ukraine, other Republican allies of the former president have backed
Kyiv’s defense against Moscow’s invasion and argue supporting Ukraine is
in America’s interest. </p>
<p>One ally of both Ukraine and Trump is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. At
a closed-door meeting Zelenskyy had with senators on Capitol Hill, also
on Thursday, Graham stood up and said he had been talking to Trump about
the Ukrainian president, according to a person familiar with the
situation and granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting. </p>
<p>Graham told those in the room he would talk to Zelenskyy privately
about his conversations with Trump, the person said. As the meeting came

China-US competition driving the Africa proposal in the UN?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Johannesburg — This week at U.N. meetings in New York, the United
States said that two African countries should have permanent seats on
one of the world’s major decision-making bodies, the United Nations
Security Council.</p>
<p>For years, numerous African leaders have called for the continent to
have representation on the U.N. Security Council, which since World War
II has had just five permanent members: the U.S., France, the UK, Russia
and China.</p>
<p>This week, the top representative of one of those permanent seats,
U.S. President Joe Biden, threw his weight behind the idea. However,
there was one major caveat, which Kenyan analyst Cliff Mboya said is not
going over well on the continent. The new African members would not have
veto power on decisions.</p>
<p>“We’ve already seeing a lot of backlash… like this is a big joke, the
question is what is the point in joining the Security Council if you
don’t have veto powers, what are you going to do there?” asked
Mboya.</p>
<p>That could play in China’s favor, as it has long positioned itself as
a fellow developing country and leader of what’s become known as the
Global South, while disparaging the West for its colonial past, said
Mboya, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Africa-China Studies at
the University of Johannesburg.</p>
<p>“So I don’t think this helps the U.S. and the West in terms of
perception and narratives, and it will only embolden African countries
to lean more to the East because it just speaks to the hypocrisy,” he
said. “China’s been able to, you know, build this coalition of emerging
and developing countries against the U.S. and Western-led world
order.”</p>
<p>But Paul Nantulya, a research associate with the Africa Center for
Strategic Studies, said he thought the announcement was a “win’’ for
U.S. diplomacy and would mostly be welcomed by African nations as it
opens the door to further negotiations.</p>
<p>“Regarding China, China has been very, you know, kind of like sitting
on the fence. So rhetorically China has said all the right things,
supporting Africa’s, what it calls Africa’s legitimate interests in the
United Nations, including the United Nations Security Council,” he
said.</p>
<p>But its plan for that has been hazy, he added.</p>
<p>“When it comes to specific details, in terms of whether China
supports permanent African representation on the council with veto
power, when it comes to that China has not articulated a position.”</p>
<p>Among those in New York this week calling for U.N. reform was South
African President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said, quote: “Africa and its 1.4
billion people remain excluded from its key decision-making
structures.”</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for reform,
saying the UNSC hasn’t kept up with a changing world and Africa is
underrepresented.</p>
<p>Some African countries want veto power in the Security Council
dispensed with entirely.</p>
<p>If there is reform, and Africa gets the two seats on the Security
Council that the U.S. proposes, key contenders could include the
continent’s largest economy, South Africa; most populous country,
Nigeria; or North African heavyweight Egypt, Nantulya told VOA.</p>
<p>However, analysts say any future process of adding African countries
as permanent members is likely to face hurdles, as there will be
problems reaching consensus. Nantulya said some African politicians
think it could even drive a wedge between countries on the
continent.</p>
<p>There are also concerns the U.S. statement could just be rhetoric —
and so far no timeline has been given regarding the next steps. Under
U.N. rules, any change to Security Council membership would need
approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly, including all five
permanent members.</p>

to meet Chinese counterpart amid concerns over China’s drone supply to
Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to
meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday, on the sidelines
of the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>
<p>This meeting between the countries’ top diplomats comes amid growing
U.S. concerns over Chinese firms supplying chips and drones to Moscow,
which have significantly bolstered Russia’s battlefield capabilities in
its war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell has told the Congress that
China’s material support for Russia’s war effort “comes from the very
top.”</p>
<p>Blinken’s talks with Wang will take place ahead of a call between
U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, expected
later this fall.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the
U.N. General Assembly that Ukraine would never accept a deal imposed by
other nations to end Russia’s 31-month invasion, questioning the motives
of China and Brazil in pushing for negotiations with Moscow.</p>
<p>For months, U.S. officials have accused China of actively aiding
Russia’s war effort. Washington has sanctioned Chinese firms providing
crucial components to Russia’s defense industry.</p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller recently told VOA that
the U.S. openly discusses its “differences” with China to ensure that
both countries “at least understand where the other is coming from, even
if we can’t reach an agreement.”</p>
<p>He added that Washington is managing its relationship with China to
prevent it from “veering from competition into conflict.”</p>

offers $20M for details about Iranian allegedly behind plot to kill
official</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. State Department announced a $20 million reward
on Thursday for information leading to the arrest of the alleged Iranian
mastermind behind a plot to assassinate former White House official John
Bolton.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said in August 2022 that they had uncovered a plot by
Shahram Poursafi, a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
(IRGC), to kill Bolton, who served as national security adviser to
former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The State Department’s Rewards for Justice program “is offering a
reward of up to $20 million for information leading to the arrest or
conviction” of Poursafi, a notice said Thursday.</p>
<p>The move came as Trump, 78, who is running for a new White House
term, claimed there were “big threats” on his life by Iran.</p>
<p>Bolton, considered a foreign policy hawk, is a fierce critic of Iran
and advocated that Trump unilaterally withdraw from the Iran nuclear
deal in 2018.</p>
<p>Poursafi allegedly offered an unidentified person inside the United
States $300,000 to kill Bolton in the capital area.</p>
<p>The plan was likely set in motion after the U.S. killing of top IRGC
commander Qassem Soleimani in Iraq in January 2020, the Justice
Department said at the time.</p>
<p>But it never made headway because the ostensible assassin became an
informant of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>Iranian authorities have dismissed the allegations as “fiction.”</p>
<p>The United States designated the entire IRGC a “foreign terrorist
organization” in 2019, after previously designating its external
operation, the Quds Force.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii is one of the Senate’s climate hawks. Or
— really — if you listen to his colleague, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse,
he’s one of the Senate’s
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/18/the-three-climateers-represent-new-type-climate-hawk-capitol-hill-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>“three
climateers,”</u></a> a group of relatively young (he’s 51) and
relatively progressive Democratic senators from solidly blue states.
</p>
<p>
He’s also no fan of Republicans. You can check
<a href="https://x.com/brianschatz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>his
account</u></a> on the social network X (née Twitter), where he has
written tens of thousands of posts, for confirmation of that.
</p>
<p>
But speaking with me in New York earlier this week, Schatz argued that
the next stage of progress on climate change will require compromising
with the opposing party. Democrats can make it easier to build and run
nuclear power plants, enhanced geothermal wells, and long-distance
transmission, he said, and those goals will be easiest to accomplish if
they do it with Republicans.
</p>
<p>
“Until and unless we both have a trifecta and eliminate the filibuster,
we are going to have to have a negotiation with people with whom we have
pretty serious disagreements,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
Not that he’s endorsing a permitting reform bill. (He hasn’t yet gotten
behind a compromise proposal from Senator Joe Manchin, an independent of
West Virginia, and Senator John Barrasso, a Republican of Wyoming,
although he called it a “serious effort.”) But he does want progressives
— and especially old-school environmentalists — to understand that
fighting climate change will mean building a new economy. “I just want
to be clear that <em><em>building</em></em> the clean energy future that
we want and need is not a rhetorical flourish,” he told me. “It means
actual construction.”
</p>
<p>
Schatz is also co-chair of the Senate Climate Change Task Force and the
Democratic caucus’s deputy whip. We recently sat down on the sidelines
of New York Climate Week, where he met with climate investors, the UN
Secretary General, and diplomats from small Pacific island nations. We
discussed permitting reform, the 2024 election, and the next major
Democratic climate bill — a so-called “Inflation Reduction Act 2.0” —
might look like. Our conversation has been edited for length and
clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When I see the phrase “IRA 2.0,” I think, wow, they’d be really
lucky to get an IRA 2.0. </strong>
</p>
<p>
But we were really lucky to get a 1.0.
</p>
<p>
<strong>That’s right. So what would go into an IRA 2.0 as you’re
thinking about it — under a presumed Harris administration here,
right?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I have a bit of caution here, only because I think we did it so
carefully last time, both on the policy side, but also in terms of
building a coalition for the bill. As much as we think we know what the
next step is, we still have to start over and do listening to Native
communities, to labor, to environmental justice communities, to the
traditional environmental organizations, to finance, to critical
minerals. We have to go and canvass the universe of stakeholders, and
start by listening rather than dropping a bill as a <em><em>fait
accompli</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
So we’re in the beginning stages of that process. The only thing I’m
attached to is [that] it should be as big as the first bill, and that we
need to remain focused on emissions reductions as the first, second, and
third priority.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Are there particular aspects of the first bill that now, several
years later, you think, </strong><em><strong><em>if we had another
knock, we</em></strong></em><strong>’</strong><em><strong><em>d do it a
little differently?</em></strong></em><strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
No, because I think that presumes that I had the pen. Nobody exactly had
the pen. The pen was passed around, so it was all about the art of the
possible. It was this very well constructed but — by necessity —
heterogeneous thing, and I imagine it would be the same way again
because we’re gonna have to get to 51 in the Senate and a majority in
the House, as well. I do think there is a ton of progress to be made on
nuclear. I think there’s a ton of progress to be made in enhanced
geothermal. And obviously everybody’s well aware of what we need to do,
um, in terms of [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s] authority
and transmission.
</p>
<p>
My own instinct is that the transmission stuff and the permitting reform
stuff is not an IRA 2.0 play. I think we have at least a punter’s chance
of getting it done this year, so I would not punt that to ‘only if we
win the trifecta.’
</p>
<p>
<strong>How are you thinking about
</strong><a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/manchin-barrasso-release-bipartisan-energy-permitting-reform-legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>the
Manchin-Barrasso permitting reform proposal</strong></u></a><strong>?
Senator Heinrich has endorsed it. There’s some trepidation among the
traditional greens that it’s going to get worse via the House before
passage, but it does tackle, in a bipartisan way, a lot of the stuff you
were just citing — nuclear, geothermal, advanced geothermal. How are you
weighing these different forces? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I think it’s a serious effort. And I think that on the transmission
side, it would accomplish a lot. I think a lot of the folks who are
opposed to this just don’t like the idea of compromising with John
Barrasso.
</p>
<p>
And fair enough. John and I do not have a ton of common ground as it
relates to energy policy, but until and unless we both have a trifecta
and eliminate the filibuster, we are going to have to have a negotiation
with people with whom we have pretty serious disagreements.
</p>
<p>
The way I always analyze these bills — from
<a href="https://www.mcguirewoods.com/client-resources/alerts/2015/12/president-signs-extender-package-for-ptc-and-itc-renewable-energy-tax-credits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
ITC and PTC extension</u></a> that was paired with the lifting of the
oil export ban [in 2015], to the IRA, to the [Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law] — is I let the science and the analysis tell me whether it’s a net
positive. And it is preliminary data now from these modeling shops, but
it’s encouraging.
</p>
<p>
Look, it’s a planetary emergency, and we are in the business of trying
to build the clean energy future that we want and need. I just want to
be clear that building the clean energy future that we want and need is
not a rhetorical flourish — it means actual construction. And for
someone who got his start in the environmental world, trying to prevent
things from being built because I care about the planet, there has to be
a shift in mindset towards building big things at scale. Otherwise,
we’re going to fry our planet.
</p>
<p>
Now, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t certain places that are
ecologically or culturally so significant that they should be left
alone. But the problem is that a lot of the laws that we have, don’t
simply protect our sacred places. They prevent wind farms from being
built in parking lots. So I just think the environmental movement has to
understand and internalize:<em><em> Oh my goodness, this is an
emergency. How fast can we go?</em></em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>When I’ve talked to traditional greens about this, they don’t
disagree that these laws are blocking stuff that we want to get built.
They say, sure, but that the result of any negotiation with Republicans
will produce a law that will result in worse outcomes. </strong>
</p>
<p>
Well, then I guess we’ll just twiddle our thumbs until the revolution
comes. I’m serious. What are we gonna do?
</p>
<p>
There are some people who don’t want to enact anything because it’s
within a capitalist model. Well, it seems to me that that conversation
can be a very brief one, because we <em><em>are</em></em> in a
capitalist model and we’re not going to allow the planet to burn while
we wait for a different economic system.
</p>
<p>
And there are those who are imagining that at some point we’re gonna
have 60 unreconstructed progressives [in the Senate] and a Democratic
president, and boy, that sounds great. But my job is to make sure we
enact laws to keep us on track towards avoiding climate catastrophe, and
that means we have to make deals now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How are you feeling about the 2024 election? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t trust happiness, so I don’t know how I feel. But obviously our
Senate candidates are holding up reasonably well. There are some tough
ones — we have some really viable challengers now in Florida and Texas.
I’m feeling optimistic, but not overly so.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you think the IRA survives a Republican trifecta? </strong>
</p>
<p>
I do. I do. I think there’s just too much money at stake, in too many
red and blue states, that I would have a hard time seeing them repealing
the thing. I think they might try to take a pound of flesh that is
mostly symbolic in nature. But I think the foundation of the
technology-neutral tax credits is not just unlikely to be repealed, but
unlikely to be modified.

id="us-port-employers-file-labor-practice-complaint-against-union">US
port employers file labor practice complaint against union</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES / WASHINGTON — Employers negotiating a labor contract at
U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports on Thursday filed an unfair labor
practice complaint against the longshoremen’s union, saying its leaders
refuse to resume talks ahead of a threatened Tuesday strike.</p>
<p>The United States Maritime Alliance said it filed the complaint with
the National Labor Relations Board because of the repeated refusal of
the International Longshoremen’s Association to return to the bargaining
table.</p>
<p>The six-year master contract between USMX and the ILA expires Monday,
and the two sides appear to be deadlocked on wage issues.</p>
<p>The employer group said it requested immediate injunctive relief
requiring the union to resume bargaining so a deal could be
finalized.</p>
<p>It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for employers to make such
complaints to the NLRB, an independent agency of the federal government
that enforces U.S. labor law, particularly with regard to collective
bargaining and unfair labor practices.</p>
<p>In rare cases, the NLRB will go to court and ask for an injunction
pending the outcome of a board case, but that can take weeks to play
out.</p>
<p>The ILA on Thursday responded, calling the USMX a poor negotiating
partner.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, ILA leader and chief negotiator Harold Daggett
said he had rebuffed USMX approaches.</p>
<p>“They call me several times each week trying to get the ILA to accept
a lowball wage package,” Daggett said.</p>
<p>Sources close to the talks said the ILA asked for a wage increase of
77%, a percentage the union called exaggerated. Industry experts predict
that the increase will be higher than the 32% raise won by the West
Coast longshoremen’s union last year.</p>
<p>Companies that rely on ocean shipping are increasingly worried that
the ILA’s 45,000 members will strike and close 36 ports that handle more
than half of U.S. ocean trade of products such as bananas, meat,
prescription drugs, auto parts, construction materials and apparel.</p>
<p>If that happens, delays and costs could quickly cascade, threatening
the U.S. economy in the weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election,
burdening already taxed global ocean shipping networks and over time
foisting higher prices on consumers.</p>
<p>Economists at Oxford Economics estimated that the impending strike
would reduce U.S. gross domestic product by $4.5 billion to $7.5
billion, or 0.1% annualized, for every week it continues.</p>
<p>A strike has the potential to weigh on the October employment report
at a time when the Federal Reserve is highly attuned to signs of
weakness in the labor market, they said.</p>
<p>The timing is politically sensitive because Democratic Vice President
Kamala Harris is facing former Republican President Donald Trump in the
U.S. presidential election on November 5.</p>
<p>A White House official on Thursday reiterated that President Joe
Biden does not intend to invoke a federal law known as the Taft-Hartley
Act to prevent a strike.</p>
<p>“We encourage all parties to come to the bargaining table and
negotiate in good faith,” the official said. “Senior officials from the
White House, Labor Department and Department of Transportation are in
touch with the parties and delivering the message to them directly.”</p>

<h2
id="eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-at-the-source">Eliminating
memory safety vulnerabilities at the source</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>The push towards memory safe programming languages is strong, and for
good reason. However, especially for bigger projects with a lot of code
that potentially needs to be rewritten or replaced, you might question
if all the effort is even worth it, particularly if all the main
contributors would also need to be retrained. Well, it turns out that
merely just focusing on writing new code in a memory safe language will
drastically reduce the number of memory safety issues in a project as a
whole. Memory safety vulnerabilities remain a pervasive threat to
software security. At Google, we believe the path to eliminating this
class of vulnerabilities at scale and building high-assurance software
lies in Safe Coding, a secure-by-design approach that prioritizes
transitioning to memory-safe languages. This post demonstrates why
focusing on Safe Coding for new code quickly and counterintuitively
reduces the overall security risk of a codebase, finally breaking
through the stubbornly high plateau of memory safety vulnerabilities and
starting an exponential decline, all while being scalable and
cost-effective. ↫ Jeff Vander Stoep and Alex Rebert at the Google
Security Blog In this blog post, Google highlights that even if you only
write new code in a memory-safe language, while only applying bug fixes
to old code, the number of memory safety issues will decreases rapidly,
even when the total amount of code written in unsafe languages
increases. This is because vulnerabilities decay exponentially – in
other words, the older the code, the fewer vulnerabilities it’ll have.
In Android, for instance, using this approach, the percentage of memory
safety vulnerabilities dropped from 76% to 24% over 6 years, which is a
great result and something quite tangible. Despite the majority of code
still being unsafe (but, crucially, getting progressively older), we’re
seeing a large and continued decline in memory safety vulnerabilities.
The results align with what we simulated above, and are even better,
potentially as a result of our parallel efforts to improve the safety of
our memory unsafe code. We first reported this decline in 2022, and we
continue to see the total number of memory safety vulnerabilities
dropping. ↫ Jeff Vander Stoep and Alex Rebert at the Google Security
Blog What this shows is that a large project, like, say, the Linux
kernel, for no particular reason whatsoever, doesn’t need to replace all
of its code with, say, Rust, again, for no particular reason whatsoever,
to reap the benefits of a modern, memory-safe language. Even by focusing
on memory-safe languages only for new code, you will still exponentially
reduce the number of memory safety vulnerabilities. This is not a new
discovery, as it’s something observed and confirmed many times before,
and it makes intuitive sense, too; older code has had more time to
mature.</p>

Congress finalizes security pact with Pacific Island allies</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Buried in the hundreds of pages of the continuing
resolution passed Wednesday by U.S. lawmakers to prevent a government
shutdown are Washington’s final steps to implement a 20-year security
pact with Pacific Island allies, cementing a U.S. commitment to the
region in the face of an increasingly assertive China.</p>
<p>The Compacts of Free Association, or COFA, provide economic support
for Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia.
In exchange, the nations will allow the U.S. military exclusive access
to their land, water and airspace and the right to deny Beijing access
to their ports and expansive territorial waters.</p>
<p>But six months after the compacts were passed, extending $7 billion
in economic aid over 20 years to the three Pacific Island nations, key
provisions still languished. Palau’s access to postal service, aviation
security, national weather service and federal banking insurance was set
to run out on September 30. The temporary spending package finalized
Wednesday contained an extension of those services, Representative Ed
Case, a Democrat, said in a statement to VOA.</p>
<p>In doing so, said Case, “The U.S. restates its commitment to the
people of Palau as a full partner in a shared future and to assisting
Palau in resisting the dependence upon and coercion by the PRC that has
marked the PRC’s efforts to dominate the countries of the Pacific.” PRC
is an abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>“Reassuring the people of Palau that they [the services] will
continue is an important message from the people of the United States to
the people of Palau,” Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr. said in an
interview with VOA on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.</p>
<p>Cleo Paskal, a nonresident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the
Foundation for Defense of Democracies, argues that the extension of
these services also sends a message to Beijing. Palau is just one of
three remaining Pacific Island nations who still recognize Taiwan
diplomatically over Beijing.</p>
<p>Paskal said that a gap in these basic services could have left Whipps
— who is running for reelection in November — vulnerable to “those
wanting to undermine the relationship with the U.S., possibly feeding
into the narrative that the U.S. isn’t helping” its Pacific
partners.</p>
<p>But U.S. lawmakers of both parties coalesced around closing the
loophole for Palau, said Whipps.</p>
<p>The agreement for Palau “represents a significant milestone in the
process of affirming our countries’ partnership for another 20 years,”
U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, a Democrat, said in a statement to
VOA. “This relationship is vital to the security and stability” of the
U.S. “as we work to promote democracy and our shared values throughout
the Pacific.”</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, a Republican who
represents the U.S. territory of American Samoa, led a hearing earlier
this month that exposed gaps in COFA implementation, including the Palau
federal services expiration.</p>
<p>“It’s extremely important to the entirety of the Pacific region for
our allies, and any nation at all, to see the U.S. following through
with its commitments to our closest friends in the region,” Coleman
Radewagen said in a statement to VOA.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
<em>New York Times</em> readers were already
<a href="https://x.com/MichaelEMann/status/1837896072225870199" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>aghast</u></a>
even before Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts — the man behind
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>Project
2025</u></a> — took the stage at the outlet’s
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/climate/climate-forward-project-2025-kevin-roberts.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Climate
Forward</u></a> event, held during New York’s bustling
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-climate-week-clean-energy" target="_blank">Climate
Week</a>. Normally, this is when famous people including researcher Jane
Goodall, Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus, and Rivian CEO R.J.
Scaringe would discuss climate solutions before an audience of the
thoughtful and well-heeled. Inviting Roberts violated that norm, which
may have been the point — nothing draws eyeballs like outrage, and for
the <em>Times’</em> elite liberal readership, bringing Roberts to a
climate discussion certainly counts as outrageous. But Roberts’ segment,
in which he was interviewed by climate reporter David Gelles, was as
revealing as anything the more friendly celebrities had to say.
</p>
<p>
Not because Gelles exposed Roberts for the climate denier he is,
discrediting fossil fuel stooges once and for all. That’s what many hope
for from this kind of encounter, but it almost never happens. Gelles did
his best, but Roberts was more than up to the challenge of advocating
the conservative approach to addressing the warming of the planet (or
rather, not addressing it) to a hostile audience.
</p>
<p>
We’ve come a long way from the time when crude denialists like Senator
Jim Inhofe were
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E0a_60PMR8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bringing
snowballs</u></a> to the Senate floor to show that global warming must
be a hoax. Roberts said many things that were framed in ways seemingly
designed to appeal to liberal principles — he defended scientific
skepticism, and claimed that when Project 2025 proposes ending civil
service protections for government employees so they can be replaced by
political appointees, its intention is to <em><em>depoliticize</em></em>
the government (“We don’t care whether they’re Democrats or Republicans;
we actually want them to be objective”) — but he returned again and
again to one conspiracy-tinged notion. Serious climate policy, he
argued, is an attack not just by American elites, but rather by an
entire <em><em>global</em></em> <em><em>elite</em></em> against ordinary
people, whom they are immiserating with ill-considered ideas not based
in science, or even in reality.
</p>
<p>
While it might seem ironic to hear the head of a think tank with a
nine-figure annual
<a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/237327730" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>budget</u></a>
that comes largely from corporate interests talking like a tribune of
the common folk, that’s where Roberts began. He started with a punch in
the nose, saying that while he was surprised to get the invitation from
the <em>Times</em>, “I’ll go anywhere to talk about how the climate
agenda is ending the American dream.” In response to the criticisms of
Project 2025, he said, “Rather than take the well-funded agenda of
elites in New York and Brussels and in the Chinese Communist Party, why
don’t we ask the American people?” And those struggling people, he
insisted, are being harmed by the transition away from fossil fuels “far
more than any of the harms that you would cite from so-called climate
change.”
</p>
<p>
Does that mean he’s a climate denier? Heavens no. “That doesn’t mean
that we’re rejecting that humans have an effect on climate; clearly they
do,” he said. So climate change is real, but also maybe not; whatever
perspective you like, you can decide Roberts agrees with you. He also
claimed that according to Heritage’s irrefutable research, there’s just
nothing we can do to stop that warming, which isn’t really a problem
anyway. “Let’s just take all the ideas of everyone in this room and we
implement them with a magic wand,” he said. “Our estimates show, what
would the difference in temperature be? Zero point two three degrees
Celsius. It’s simply not going to make a difference.”
</p>
<p>
That kind of faux-precision is impossible to adjudicate in the moment,
of course, which is why it can be so effective. This is another key
theme for Roberts and others like him. “There is this thesis that if the
United States leads on climate policy, the world will follow. That
hasn’t happened,” he said. “In fact, if we eliminate all emissions and
pollution in the United States, it has an almost non-measurable impact
on pollution and emissions worldwide.” That’s just false — the U.S. is
still the second-largest carbon
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>emitter
</u></a>in the world, after China — but if it were true, then why should
we bother cutting our emissions, if doing so would have a
“non-measurable impact”? There are no benefits, only costs.
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration, he said, “have made a grave mistake. They have
taken the will of elites and they’ve imposed this on the American
people.” And don’t think Roberts is an advocate for the corporate elites
that pay his considerable salary; heck no, he’s just a humble reg’lar
fella, thinking about the good honest folk who have no one to speak for
them. “I see public policy through the lens of working-class people,” he
insisted. “Our perspective at Heritage is on behalf of not just ordinary
Americans but the global poor who are damaged by these policies.”
<em><em>The global poor</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
What Roberts offers is climate denial without guilt. The details of
increasing temperatures and their effects on people in the present and
future are quickly minimized, then the focus shifts to imaginary harms
to the vulnerable not from climate change but from climate action. Every
emissions reduction proposal is dismissed as an indulgence of repugnant
elitists, leaving only one moral alternative: to do nothing about
climate change except burn more fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Presenting climate denial as an act of selflessness might seem
appalling, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t attractive. If you want to
hold to outright denialism, Roberts is with you. But if you admit that
climate change is happening, he’s got you covered; what matters is that
we shouldn’t do anything about it, because inaction is the real way to
care for the vulnerable and fight back against the nefarious forces
holding the world in their grip. The chutzpah is jaw-dropping, but it
would be a mistake to think no one will find this argument attractive.

<h2 id="us-vietnamese-leaders-meet-seek-deeper-ties">US, Vietnamese
leaders meet, seek deeper ties</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden says Washington is committed to
a strong, prosperous, resilient, and independent Vietnam and discussed a
broad range of ways the two countries can cooperate during a meeting
with this Vietnamese counterpart, To Lam.</p>
<p>Since coming to office in May, Vietnam’s new president has been
actively reaching out, meeting with the leaders of China and Russia.
Washington is seeking to counter those advances and strengthen ties with
Hanoi as well.</p>
<p>Lam, who is also head of the ruling Communist Party, met with Biden
on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York
Wednesday. According to a White House statement, the two talked about
“building secure and resilient semiconductor supply chains” and
strengthening their tech relationship as well as progress in
cybersecurity cooperation and Vietnam’s efforts to increase its digital
connectivity.</p>
<p>Vietnam is looking to the United States and China to triple its
number of subsea cables by 2030. Biden and Lam also focused on ways the
two could deepen a comprehensive strategic partnership they entered last
year.</p>
<p>Biden said Washington wants to cooperate with Vietnam to uphold a
free and open Indo-Pacific and discussed the importance of maintaining
peace and stability — especially in the South China Sea, according to
the White House statement.</p>
<p>During the meeting, which lasted a little more than an hour, Lam
assured Biden that the United States is “a partner of strategic
importance,” while Biden told Lam that Vietnam is “a top partner of the
U.S. in the region,” Vietnam News Agency reported.</p>
<p>Analysts say that while the meeting did not take place in the White
House, it did highlight the high level of trust between Hanoi and
Washington and the growing importance of bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Nguyen Hong Hai, a lecturer of international relations at Hanoi-based
VinUni, told VOA in an email that the way Washington and Hanoi are
talking about one another and the high importance they attach to
bilateral relations is significant. It is also a sign of deepening
trust, Hai added.</p>
<p>“Vietnam falls short of a U.S. ally. But as a partner, it is a top of
its kind,” Hai said.</p>
<p>Hai said that Hanoi fits perfectly into Washington’s Free and Open
Indo-Pacific strategy since it supports the rules-based order and is
playing an increasingly bigger role in the U.S.-led global supply chain.
On the other hand, Hanoi needs Washington as a regional security
guarantor while its goal of becoming a developed economy with high
income by 2045 is contingent on access to the U.S. market as well as its
capital and technology.</p>
<p>Ha Hoang Hop, chair of the Hanoi-based Think Tank Viet Know, said it
was significant that both leaders reaffirmed the importance of their
comprehensive strategic partnership. So, too, was Biden’s commitment to
support Vietnam’s tech-driven growth and encouragement for Hanoi to play
an active role in regional security.</p>
<p>“The momentum of U.S.-Vietnam comprehensive strategic partnership
will be maintained far beyond Biden’s and To Lam’s presidencies no
matter who will succeed Biden next year or who will take the helm of the
Vietnamese Communist Party in 2026,” Hop told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>The two countries recently marked the first anniversary of the
comprehensive strategic partnership Biden signed with Nguyen Phu Trong,
Lam’s predecessor, during a visit to Hanoi last year.</p>
<p>At that time, Lam was the country’s security czar. He became
president following the forced resignation of President Vo Van Thuong in
March and replaced Nguyen Phu Trong as party chief after Trong
unexpectedly died in late July.</p>
<p>Lam’s first foreign trip after becoming Vietnam’s top leader took him
to Beijing in August, when he and Chinese President Xi Jinping
reaffirmed their commitment to bilateral ties. He also hosted Russia’s
Vladimir Putin in Hanoi in late June.</p>
<p>Although readouts of Wednesday’s meeting gave no indication that
China was discussed, Beijing was watching the meeting closely, Hai
said.</p>
<p>China became Vietnam’s first comprehensive strategic partner in 2008,
and the two countries agreed late last year to build what they call a
“community of shared future” following the upgrade in U.S.-Vietnam
ties.</p>
<p>“Any progress in U.S.-Vietnam ties is unwelcome in Beijing. However,
Bejing should understand that Hanoi’s deepening ties with the U.S. is
not targeted at any country but just serves its own security,” Hai
said.</p>
<p>Think Tank Viet Know’s Ha Hoang Hop said that Beijing is “fully aware
of Hanoi’s strategic position in the Free and Open Indo-Pacific
strategy” and is trying to capitalize on this to serve its
interests.</p>
<p>“For its part, Hanoi is proactively navigating between the two
superpowers,” he said.</p>

Russia ahead of President Joe Biden’s meeting with Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy. </p>
<p>U.S. Treasury sanctioned alleged Russian hacker Sergey Ivanov and
Cryptex — a St. Vincent and Grenadines registered virtual currency
exchange operating in Russia. Virtual currency exchanges allow people
and businesses to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as
conventional dollars or other digital currencies. </p>
<p>Treasury alleges that Ivanov has laundered hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of virtual currency for cyber criminals and darknet
marketplace vendors for the last 20 years, including for Timur
Shakhmametov, who allegedly created an online marketplace for stolen
credit card data and compromised IDs called Joker’s Stash. Ivanov
laundered the proceeds from Joker’s Stash, Treasury says. </p>
<p>The State Department is offering a $10 million reward for information
that would lead to the arrest and possible conviction of the two men,
and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Virginia has unsealed an indictment
against them. </p>
<p>Biden said in a statement announcing the sanctions Thursday that the
U.S. “will continue to raise the costs on Russia for its war in Ukraine
and to deprive the Russian defense industrial base of resources.” </p>
<p>He meets with Zelenskyy Thursday to announce a surge in security
assistance for Ukraine and other actions meant to assist the war-torn
country as Russia continues to invade. </p>
<p>State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller said, “We will continue to
use all our tools and authorities to deter and expose these money
laundering networks and impose cost on the cyber criminals and support
networks. We reiterate our call that Russia must take concrete steps to
prevent cyber criminals from freely operating in its jurisdiction.” </p>
<p>U.S officials have taken several actions against Russian
cybercriminals since the start of the invasion in February 2022. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control
sanctioned 13 firms — five of which are owned by an already sanctioned
person — and two people who have all either helped build or operate
blockchain-based services for, or enabled virtual currency payments in,
the Russian financial sector, “thus enabling potential sanctions
evasion,” according to U.S. Treasury.</p>

Adams’ lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in a statement, adding that the mayor
had not been arrested. “They send a dozen agents to pick up a phone when
we would have happily turned it in.”</p>
<p>Federal law enforcement agents were seen entering the mayor’s
Manhattan residence at dawn Wednesday, with several vehicles bearing
federal law enforcement placards parked outside.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan has declined to comment on
the investigation. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment. A
spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to questions
Thursday morning.</p>
<p>In a video speech released Wednesday night, Adams vowed to fight any
charges against him, claiming he had been made a “target” in a case
“based on lies.”</p>
<p>“I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my
spirit,” he said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what laws Adams is accused of breaking
or when he might have to appear in court.</p>
<p>The indictment caps off an extraordinary few weeks in New York City,
as federal investigators have homed in on members of Adams’ inner
circle, producing a drumbeat of raids, subpoenas and high-level
resignations.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors are believed to be leading multiple, separate
inquiries involving Adams and his senior aides, relatives of those
aides, campaign fundraising and possible influence peddling of the
police and fire departments.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks alone, the city’s police commissioner and head
of the school’s system have announced their resignations.</p>
<p>FBI agents had seized Adams’ electronic devices nearly a year ago as
part of an investigation focused, at least partly, on campaign
contributions and Adams’ interactions with the Turkish government.
Because the charges were sealed, it was unknown whether they dealt with
those same matters.</p>
<p>In early September, federal investigators seized devices from his
police commissioner, schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and other
trusted confidantes both in and out of City Hall.</p>
<p>All have denied wrongdoing.</p>

‘Oligarchy’ of super-rich undermining cooperation to tackle poverty,
climate change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — As world leaders gather for the annual United Nations
General Assembly in New York this week, the charity Oxfam says they are
being undermined by what it calls a “global oligarchy” of the super-rich
who exert considerable control over the global economy – and who it
blames for exacerbating problems like extreme inequality and climate
change.</p>
<p>“Today, the world’s richest 1% own more wealth than 95% of humanity.
The immense concentration of wealth, driven significantly by increased
monopolistic corporate power, has allowed large corporations and the
ultrarich who exercise control over them to use their vast resources to
shape global rules in their favor, often at the expense of everyone
else,” the Oxfam report says.</p>
<p>The charity says international cooperation on issues like climate
change and poverty is failing due to extreme economic inequality.</p>
<p>“The wealth of the world’s five richest men has doubled since the
start of this decade. And nearly five billion people have got poorer,”
said Nabil Ahmed, the director of economic and racial justice at Oxfam
America, in an interview with VOA.</p>
<p>Fair taxes</p>
<p>The report urges fairer taxation of large corporations and the
ultra-wealthy.</p>
<p>“We live in a world in which mega-corporations… are paying next to or
little to no tax basically. Not like the small businesses, not like the
rest of us,” Ahmed said.</p>
<p>“It’s such a phenomenal lost opportunity because we know governments,
rich and poor, across the world need to claw back these revenues to be
able to invest in their people, to be able to meet their rights,” he
added.</p>
<p>Oxfam praises a campaign led by Brazil, which currently holds the
presidency of the G20, to impose a 2% minimum tax on the world’s richest
billionaires. Brazil’s government claims it would raise up to $250
billion from about 3,000 individuals, to pay for healthcare, education
and tackling climate change.</p>
<p>A report by the French economist Gabriel Zucman, commissioned by
Brazil, suggests billionaires currently pay the equivalent of 0.3% of
their wealth in taxes.</p>
<p>The plan is backed by other members including South Africa, Spain and
France. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke against the
move at a G20 meeting in July.</p>
<p>“Tax policy is very difficult to coordinate globally and we don’t see
a need or really think it’s desirable to try to negotiate a global
agreement on that. We think that all countries should make sure that
their taxation systems are fair and progressive,” Yellen told
reporters.</p>
<p>Private debt</p>
<p>Oxfam says tax revenues in the global south meanwhile are
increasingly spent on servicing debt to private creditors like banks and
hedge funds.</p>
<p>“This shift has exacerbated the debt crisis, further entrenching
“debtocracy.” Compared with official creditors, private entities issue
debt with shorter maturities and higher, more volatile interest rates,”
the Oxfam report says.</p>
<p>Vaccines</p>
<p>The charity also accuses large pharmaceutical companies of shaping
rules over intellectual property rights to benefit their shareholders.
Oxfam says that during the COVID-19 pandemic, this meant poorer nations
struggled to access coronavirus vaccines, such as the mRNA vaccine made
by Pfizer.</p>
<p>“Its negative impacts are most harshly felt by countries in the
Global South, which bear the brunt of “artificial rationing,” where
pharmaceutical corporations keep drug costs — and thus profits — high by
limiting generic manufacturing, while simultaneously failing to invest
in research and development for priority diseases in the Global South
deemed less profitable,” Oxfam said.</p>
<p>Responding to VOA, Pfizer highlighted an open letter written by the
company’s chairman Albert Bourla in 2021, in which he said the company
had created a tiered pricing structure and had offered its mRNA
coronavirus vaccine at cost price or for free to poorer nations.
However, Bourla said that many richer countries moved faster to purchase
the available doses.</p>
<p>“When we developed our tiered pricing policy, we reached out to all
nations asking them to place orders so we could allocate doses for them.
In reality, the high-income countries reserved most of the doses,”
Bourla wrote.</p>
<p>Pfizer’s chairman also warned that losing intellectual property
rights could “disincentivize” anyone else from taking a big financial
risk in developing such vaccines, a view echoed by other large
pharmaceutical giants.</p>

The results of a new study may provide some good news for forests across

published in the journal <em><em>Nature Ecology &amp;
Evolution</em></em>, suggests the trees’ carbon storage capabilities
remain stable even while temperatures are rising and the soil becomes
more acidic due to nitrogen enrichment from burning fossil fuels.
Previous studies have indicated that carbon storage declines in these
conditions. But what makes this research different is that it looked at
the effects of both conditions together, rather than separately. “What
is most exciting about this study is that it’s one of the
longest-running experiments to look at two global change pressures

many homeowners</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Last week, refinance applications were up 20% from a week earlier. The
number of people who could benefit from refinancing — especially those
who took out mortgages with interest rates in the high 6% to 7% range —
has been growing over the last few weeks, but not everyone is making the
jump. Plus, OpenAI looks to switch from a nonprofit to for-profit
entity, and buy now, pay later is expected to surge this year.

id="harris-promises-tax-breaks-investments-for-us-manufacturers">Harris
promises tax breaks, investments for US manufacturers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PITTSBURGH — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday she
would offer tax credits to domestic manufacturers and invest in sectors
that will “define the next century,” as she detailed her economic plan
to boost the U.S. middle class.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in the battleground state
of Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate in the November 5 presidential
election said she would give tax credits to U.S. manufacturers for
retooling or rebuilding existing factories and expanding “good union
jobs,” and double the number of registered apprenticeships during her
first term.</p>
<p>Harris also promised new investments in industries like
bio-manufacturing, aerospace, artificial intelligence and clean
energy.</p>
<p>Harris’ speech, which lasted just under 40 minutes, did not detail
how these policies would work. She highlighted her upbringing by a
single mother, in contrast with former President Donald Trump, the
wealthy son of a New York real estate developer.</p>
<p>“I have pledged that building a strong middle class will be the
defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said, adding that she sees the
election as a moment of choice between two “fundamentally different”
visions of the U.S. economy held by her and her Republican opponent,
Trump.</p>
<p>The vice president and Trump are focusing their campaign messaging on
the economy, which Reuters/Ipsos polling shows is voters’ top concern,
as the election approaches.</p>
<p>The divide between rich and poor has grown in recent decades. The
share of American households in the middle class, defined as those with
two-thirds to double that of median household income, has dropped from
around 62% in 1970 to 51% in 2023, Pew Research shows. These households’
income has also not grown as fast as those in the top tier.</p>
<p>Harris said she was committed to working with the private sector and
entrepreneurs to help grow the middle class. She told the audience that
she is “a capitalist” who believes in “free and fair markets,” and
described her policies as pragmatic rather than rooted in ideology.</p>
<p>Harris in recent months has blunted Trump’s advantage on the economy,
with a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday showing the Republican
candidate with a marginal advantage of 2 percentage points on “the
economy, unemployment and jobs,” down from an 11-point lead in late
July.</p>
<p>Trump discussed his economic plan in North Carolina on Wednesday and
said Harris’ role as vice president gave her the chance now to improve
the economic record of the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“Families are suffering now. So if she has a plan, she should stop
grandstanding and do it,” he said. While Trump has proposed
across-the-board tariffs on foreign-made goods – a proposal backed by a
slim majority of voters – Harris is focusing on providing incentives for
businesses to keep their operations in the U.S.</p>
<p>Boosting American manufacturing in industries such as semiconductors
and bringing back jobs that have moved overseas in recent decades have
also been major goals for Biden. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs
Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act – all
passed in 2021 and 2022 – fund a range of subsidies and tax incentives
that encourage companies to place projects in disadvantaged regions.</p>

id="hurricane-helene-is-expected-to-hit-florida-as-a-major-storm-strike-far-inland">Hurricane
Helene is expected to hit Florida as a major storm, strike far
inland</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TALLAHASSEE, Florida — An enormous Hurricane Helene swamped parts of
Mexico on Wednesday as it churned on a path forecasters said would take
it to Florida as a potentially catastrophic storm with a surge that
could swallow entire homes, a chilling warning that sent residents
scrambling for higher ground, closed schools, and led to states of
emergency throughout the Southeast.</p>
<p>Helene’s center was about 735 kilometers southwest of Tampa, Florida,
the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, and the hurricane was expected
to intensify and accelerate as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico toward the
Big Bend area of Florida’s northwestern coast. Landfall was expected
sometime Thursday evening, and the hurricane center said by then it
could be a major Category 4 storm with winds above 208 kph.</p>
<p>Tropical storm conditions were expected in southern Florida on
Wednesday night, spreading northward and encompassing the rest of
Florida as well as Georgia and South Carolina through Thursday night.
The storm was moving north at 19 kph with top sustained winds of 140 kph
Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Helene could create a life-threatening storm surge as high as 6.1
meters in parts of the Big Bend region, forecasters said. Its tropical
storm-force winds extended as far as 555 kilometers from its center.</p>
<p>The fast-moving storm’s wind and rain also could penetrate far
inland: The hurricane center posted hurricane warnings well into Georgia
and tropical storm warnings as far north as North Carolina, and it
warned that much of the Southeast could experience prolonged power
outages, toppled trees and dangerous flooding.</p>
<p>“Just hope and pray that everybody’s safe,” said Connie Dillard, of
Tallahassee, as she shopped at a grocery store with thinning shelves of
water and bread before hitting the highway out of town. “That’s all you
can do.”</p>
<p>One insurance firm, Gallagher Re, is expecting billions of dollars in
damage in the U.S. Around 18,000 linemen from out of state staged in
Florida, ready to help restore power. Airports in St. Petersburg,
Tallahassee and Tampa were planning to close on Thursday, and 62
hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities evacuated their
residents Wednesday.</p>
<p>Georgia activated 250 National Guard soldiers for rapid deployment.
State game wardens, foresters and Department of Correction teams will
help provide swift-water rescues and other emergency responses.</p>
<p>State meteorologist Will Lanxton said tropical storm-force winds are
expected throughout Georgia. Lanxton said metro Atlanta hasn’t seen
sustained tropical storm winds since Hurricane Irma in 2017.</p>
<p>“I think we’re going to see some significant power outages, probably
nothing like we’ve seen, because it’s 159 counties wide,” said James
Stallings, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland
Security Agency.</p>
<p>In Tallahassee, where stations started to run out of gas, 19-year-old
Florida A&amp;M student Kameron Benjamin filled sandbags with his
roommate to protect their apartment before evacuating. Their school and
Florida State shut down.</p>
<p>“This hurricane is heading straight to Tallahassee, so I really don’t
know what to expect,” Benjamin said.</p>
<p>As Big Bend residents battened down their homes, many saw the ghost
of 2018’s Hurricane Michael. That storm rapidly intensified and crashed
ashore as a Category 5 that laid waste to Panama City and parts of the
rural Panhandle.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the National Weather Service posted an urgent warning
for residents along Apalachee Bay: “There is a danger of catastrophic
and unsurvivable storm surge for Apalachee Bay,” it said. “Storm surge
may begin to arrive as early as late Wednesday night ahead of the winds.
This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee
Bay. Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!”</p>
<p>“People are taking heed and hightailing it out of there for higher
ground,” said Kristin Korinko, a Tallahassee resident who serves as the
commodore of the Shell Point Sailboard Club, on the Gulf Coast about 48
kilometers south of Tallahassee.</p>
<p>For toughened Floridians who are used to hurricanes, Robbie Berg, a
national warning coordinator for the hurricane center, advised: “Please
do not compare it to other storms you may have experienced over the past
year or two.”</p>
<p>Helene is forecast to be one of the largest storms in breadth in
years to hit the region, said Colorado State University hurricane
researcher Phil Klotzbach. He said since 1988, only three Gulf
hurricanes were bigger than Helene’s predicted size: 2017’s Irma, 2005’s
Wilma and 1995’s Opal.</p>
<p>Areas 160 kilometers north of the Georgia-Florida line can expect
hurricane conditions. More than half of Georgia’s public school
districts and several universities canceled classes.</p>
<p>And for Atlanta, which is under a tropical storm watch, Helene could
be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said
University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a lot like Hugo in Charlotte,” Shepherd said of the
1989 storm that struck the North Carolina city, knocking out power to
85% of customers as winds gusted above hurricane force.</p>
<p>Landslides were possible in southern Appalachia, with catastrophic
flooding predicted in the Carolinas and Georgia, where all three
governors declared emergencies. Rainfall is possible as far away as
Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana.</p>
<p>Parts of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula were under hurricane warnings as
Helene wound between it and the western tip of Cuba and into the Gulf of
Mexico. The storm formed Tuesday in the Caribbean, and it flooded
streets and toppled trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort
city of Cancun.</p>
<p>In Cuba, authorities moved cattle to higher ground and medical
brigades went to communities often cut off by storms. The government
preventively shut off power in some communities as waves as high as 5
meters slammed Cortes Bay. In the Cayman Islands, schools remained
closed as residents pumped water from flooded homes.</p>
<p>In the U.S., federal authorities positioned generators, food and
water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams.</p>
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that Helene could be as strong as a
Category 4 hurricane when it makes landfall. The state was providing
buses to evacuate people in the Big Bend region and taking them to
shelters in Tallahassee.</p>
<p>But near Florida’s center, outside Orlando, Walt Disney World said
its only closures Thursday would be the Typhoon Lagoon water park and
its miniature golf courses.</p>
<p>Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year
because of record-warm ocean temperatures.</p>
<p>In the Pacific, former Hurricane John reformed Wednesday as a
tropical storm and was strengthening as it threatened areas of Mexico’s
western coast. Officials posted hurricane warnings for southwestern
Mexico.</p>
<p>John hit the country’s southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing at
least two people, triggering mudslides, and damaging homes and trees. It
grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours and made landfall
east of Acapulco. It reemerged over the ocean after weakening
inland.</p>

<h2 id="postgresql-17-released">PostgreSQL 17 Released!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-26, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL Global Development
Group</a> today announced the release of
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/release-17.html">PostgreSQL
17</a>, the latest version of the world’s most advanced open source
database.
</p>
<p>
PostgreSQL 17 builds on decades of open source development, improving
its performance and scalability while adapting to emergent data access
and storage patterns. This release of
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> adds significant
overall performance gains, including an overhauled memory management
implementation for vacuum, optimizations to storage access and
improvements for high concurrency workloads, speedups in bulk loading
and exports, and query execution improvements for indexes. PostgreSQL 17
has features that benefit brand new workloads and critical systems
alike, such as additions to the developer experience with the SQL/JSON
<code>JSON_TABLE</code> command, and enhancements to logical replication
that simplify management of high availability workloads and major
version upgrades.
</p>
<p>
“PostgreSQL 17 highlights how the global open source community, which
drives the development of PostgreSQL, builds enhancements that help
users at all stages of their database journey,” said Jonathan Katz, a
member of the PostgreSQL core team. “Whether it’s improvements for
operating databases at scale or new features that build on a delightful
developer experience, PostgreSQL 17 will enhance your data management
experience.”
</p>
<p>
PostgreSQL, an innovative data management system known for its
reliability, robustness, and extensibility, benefits from over 25 years
of open source development from a global developer community and has
become the preferred open source relational database for organizations
of all sizes.
</p>
<h3>
System-wide performance gains
</h3>
<p>
The PostgreSQL
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/routine-vacuuming.html">vacuum</a>
process is critical for healthy operations, requiring server instance
resources to operate. PostgreSQL 17 introduces a new internal memory
structure for vacuum that consumes up to 20x less memory. This improves
vacuum speed and also reduces the use of shared resources, making more
available for your workload.
</p>
<p>
PostgreSQL 17 continues to improve performance of its I/O layer. High
concurrency workloads may see up to 2x better write throughput due to
improvements with
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/wal-intro.html">write-ahead
log</a>
(<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/wal-intro.html">WAL</a>)
processing. Additionally, the new streaming I/O interface speeds up
sequential scans (reading all the data from a table) and how quickly
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-analyze.html"><code>ANALYZE</code></a>
can update planner statistics.
</p>
<p>
PostgreSQL 17 also extends its performance gains to query execution.
PostgreSQL 17 improves the performance of queries with <code>IN</code>
clauses that use
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/indexes-types.html#INDEXES-TYPES-BTREE">B-tree</a>
indexes, the default index method in PostgreSQL. Additionally,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/brin.html">BRIN</a> indexes
now support parallel builds. PostgreSQL 17 includes several improvements
for query planning, including optimizations for <code>NOT NULL</code>
constraints, and improvements in processing
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/queries-with.html">common
table expressions</a>
(<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/queries-with.html"><code>WITH</code>
queries</a>). This release adds more SIMD (Single Instruction/Multiple
Data) support for accelerating computations, including using AVX-512 for
the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-bitstring.html"><code>bit_count</code></a>
function.
</p>
<h3>
Further expansion of a robust developer experience
</h3>
<p>
PostgreSQL was the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-92-released-1415/">first
relational database to add JSON support (2012)</a>, and PostgreSQL 17
adds to its implementation of the SQL/JSON standard.
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-TABLE"><code>JSON_TABLE</code></a>
is now available in PostgreSQL 17, letting developers convert JSON data
into a standard PostgreSQL table. PostgreSQL 17 now supports
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-JSON-CREATION-TABLE">SQL/JSON
constructors</a> (<code>JSON</code>, <code>JSON_SCALAR</code>,
<code>JSON_SERIALIZE</code>) and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#SQLJSON-QUERY-FUNCTIONS">query
functions</a> (<code>JSON_EXISTS</code>, <code>JSON_QUERY</code>,
<code>JSON_VALUE</code>), giving developers other ways of interfacing
with their JSON data. This release adds more
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-json.html#FUNCTIONS-SQLJSON-PATH-OPERATORS"><code>jsonpath</code>
expressions</a>, with an emphasis of converting JSON data to a native
PostgreSQL data type, including numeric, boolean, string, and date/time
types.
</p>
<p>
PostgreSQL 17 adds more features to
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-merge.html"><code>MERGE</code></a>,
which is used for conditional updates, including a
<code>RETURNING</code> clause and the ability to update
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-createview.html">views</a>.
Additionally, PostgreSQL 17 has new capabilities for bulk loading and
data exporting, including up to a 2x performance improvement when
exporting large rows using the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-copy.html"><code>COPY</code></a>
command. <code>COPY</code> performance also has improvements when the
source and destination encodings match, and includes a new option,
<code>ON_ERROR</code>, that allows an import to continue even if there
is an insert error.
</p>
<p>
This release expands on functionality both for managing data in
partitions and data distributed across remote PostgreSQL instances.
PostgreSQL 17 supports using identity columns and exclusion constraints
on
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/ddl-partitioning.html">partitioned
tables</a>. The
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/postgres-fdw.html">PostgreSQL
foreign data wrapper</a>
(<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/postgres-fdw.html"><code>postgres_fdw</code></a>),
used to execute queries on remote PostgreSQL instances, can now push
<code>EXISTS</code> and <code>IN</code> subqueries to the remote server
for more efficient processing.
</p>
<p>
PostgreSQL 17 also includes a built-in, platform independent, immutable
collation provider that’s guaranteed to be immutable and provides
similar sorting semantics to the <code>C</code> collation except with
<code>UTF-8</code> encoding rather than <code>SQL_ASCII</code>. Using
this new collation provider guarantees that your text-based queries will
return the same sorted results regardless of where you run PostgreSQL.
</p>
<h3>
Logical replication enhancements for high availability and major version
upgrades
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/logical-replication.html">Logical
replication</a> is used to stream data in real-time across many use
cases. However, prior to this release, users who wanted to perform a
major version upgrade would have to drop
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/logical-replication-subscription.html#LOGICAL-REPLICATION-SUBSCRIPTION-SLOT">logical
replication slots</a>, which requires resynchronizing data to
subscribers after an upgrade. Starting with upgrades from PostgreSQL 17,
users don’t have to drop logical replication slots, simplifying the
upgrade process when using logical replication.
</p>
<p>
PostgreSQL 17 now includes failover control for logical replication,
making it more resilient when deployed in high availability
environments. Additionally, PostgreSQL 17 introduces the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgcreatesubscriber.html"><code>pg_createsubscriber</code></a>
command-line tool for converting a physical replica into a new logical
replica.
</p>
<h3>
More options for managing security and operations
</h3>
<p>
PostgreSQL 17 further extends how users can manage the overall lifecycle
of their database systems. PostgreSQL has a new TLS option,
<code>sslnegotiation</code>, that lets users perform a direct TLS
handshakes when using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation">ALPN</a>
(registered as <code>postgresql</code> in the ALPN directory).
PostgreSQL 17 also adds the <code>pg_maintain</code>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/predefined-roles.html">predefined
role</a>, which gives users permission to perform maintenance
operations.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgbasebackup.html"><code>pg_basebackup</code></a>,
the backup utility included in PostgreSQL, now supports incremental
backups and adds the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgcombinebackup.html"><code>pg_combinebackup</code></a>
utility to reconstruct a full backup. Additionally,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-pgdump.html"><code>pg_dump</code></a>
includes a new option called <code>–filter</code> that lets you select
what objects to include when generating a dump file.
</p>
<p>
PostgreSQL 17 also includes enhancements to monitoring and analysis
features.
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/sql-explain.html"><code>EXPLAIN</code></a>
now shows the time spent for local I/O block reads and writes, and
includes two new options: <code>SERIALIZE</code> and
<code>MEMORY</code>, useful for seeing the time spent in data conversion
for network transmission, and how much memory was used. PostgreSQL 17
now reports the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/progress-reporting.html#VACUUM-PROGRESS-REPORTING">progress
of vacuuming indexes</a>, and adds the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/view-pg-wait-events.html"><code>pg_wait_events</code></a>
system view that, when combined with
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW"><code>pg_stat_activity</code></a>,
gives more insight into why an active session is waiting.
</p>
<h3>

17 that may also be helpful for your use cases. Please see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/release-17.html">release
notes</a> for a complete list of new and changed features.
