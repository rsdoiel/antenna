## Harris calls on Trump to debate with mics 'on the whole time'

date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in the November 5 U.S. presidential election, on Saturday called on her Republican rival, Donald Trump, to debate her with their microphones switched on throughout the event.


Harris and the former president have agreed to a debate, hosted by ABC News, on September 10.


"Donald Trump is surrendering to his advisors who won't allow him to debate with a live microphone. If his own team doesn't have confidence in him, the American people definitely can’t," Harris said in a post on social media platform X.


"We are running for President of the United States. Let’s debate in a transparent way with the microphones on the whole time."


Trump has said that he preferred to have his microphone kept on and that he did not like it muted during the last debate against then-contender President Joe Biden.


So-called "hot mics" can help or hurt political candidates, catching off-hand comments that sometimes were not meant for the public. Muted microphones also prevent the debaters from interrupting their opponent.


A representative for ABC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.


The debate would be the first time Harris and Trump face off since Biden dropped out of the presidential race following a poor performance at a CNN debate in June that raised doubts about his mental acuity.


Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz and Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance have agreed to an October 1 debate on CBS News.

## Harris’ record in California praised, ridiculed, in US presidential campaign

U.S. presidential candidate Kamala Harris is from one of America’s most politically liberal states — California. Her work as a local prosecutor, the state’s attorney general and U.S. senator is central to Harris’ presidential campaign. Her opponent, Donald Trump, says that Harris’ record in California shows she is too liberal for the rest of America. From Los Angeles, Genia Dulot tells us what Californians are saying.

## High rents are forcing small businesses in into tough choices

date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — While many costs have come down for small businesses, rents remain high and in some cases are still rising, forcing many owners into some uncomfortable decisions.


"Every time the rent goes up, we have to raise prices, to keep up with the cost," said Adelita Valentine, owner of HairFreek Barbers in Los Angeles. "But with the cost of living, it makes it difficult on our customers."


Other owners are choosing to be late on payments or seeking out new locations where the rent is lower. A few are pushing back against their landlord.


Although inflation is easing, it remains a top concern for small businesses. According to Bank of America internal data, rent payments per small business client rose 11% year-over-year in July. That's more than twice the increase for renting and owning a residence, a metric known as shelter, according to the government's monthly Consumer Price Index. That figure rose 5.1% in July.


And although the situation has improved since the height of the pandemic, a survey by business networking platform Alignable of more than 6,000 small business owners found that 41% could not pay their July rent on time and in full. And 52% said they've encountered rent spikes in the past six months.


The rent for Valentine's barbershop rose to $4,000 in January from $3,600 in December, the fifth increase in the past eight years. She had to raise the price for her cuts from $35 to $40.


Two months ago, she moved locations for a cheaper $3,200 rent, but her space is smaller now and she sees fewer families coming in.


"A lot of people can't afford to take a whole family to get haircuts," after the price increase, she said.


Peter Yu has owned iPAC Automotive, an auto repair and detailing shop in Ontario, Canada, for six years. He said the rent on the shop typically went up about 4% a year. But when his landlord sold the property to a new owner, Yu's rent jumped from about $1,800 (2,500 Canadian dollars) to about $2,700 (3,700 Canadian dollars) after three months.


He contemplated moving but decided that the cost of a move would be more than just paying the extra rent.




Yu tried to raise prices a month ago, but customers would come in and say "Oh, its too expensive," and leave, he said. So, he had to drop the price increase in order to get those customers back.


"When we do try to raise our prices, consumers don't have the money to pay for it. They're looking for financing options," he said. Yu's services run the gamut from paint correction that costs a few hundred dollars to troubleshooting problematic EV battery and electric drive units for out-of-warranty Teslas that can cost up to $15,000.


So instead, he's going to try to improve his marketing, close more sales, and find a way to offer more financing.


Standing firm against a landlord sometimes works. Janna Rodriguez has run her home-based The Innovative Daycare Corp. in Freeport, New York, since 2018. When she first signed her lease, she paid $3,500, plus costs including landscaping and maintenance. In 2020, the pandemic began, and her landlord raised her rent to $3,800 and also made her start paying half of the homeowner's insurance. Last year, the landlord raised her rent to $4,100, plus the additional expenses.


Rodriguez raised her prices for the first time, by $10 per child per week, to help offset the rising rent.


This year she successfully pushed back when the landlord wanted to raise the rent yet again.


"I said to them, if you do that, then I'm going to find another property to move my business to, because at this point now you're trying to bankrupt a business, right?" 


It's worked – so far. But Rodriguez is worried about the future.


For others, negotiating a late payment is an option. Nicole Pomije owner of Minneapolis-based The Cookie Cups, which makes cookie kits for kids, has a 372-square-meter office space along with a warehouse where she develops her line of baking kits. Her rent rose 10% this year to $4,000 monthly. Then there are unanticipated bills, such as $1,500 for snow plowing.


"There's so much stuff that pops up that you just you never expect," she said. "And it's always when you never expect it."


Pomije hasn't raised prices, but instead tried to mitigate the higher rent costs by buying materials in bulk – like ordering 5,000 boxes instead of 1,000 boxes for a 40% discount -- and finding cost savings elsewhere.


Still, there have been several months over the past couple of years where she couldn't pay rent on time. So, far the landlord has been amenable.


"If we have a conversation like hey, we don't know if we're going to make it for the first this month. It might be closer to the tenth," she said.


Asked if she thinks costs might ease in the future, Pomije said she is focused on the present.


"It's weird, but I'm trying not to think about the future too much and I'm trying to just do what we have to do, and get ready for a holiday season and just, like, get everything paid on time now," she said. "And then we'll kind of reevaluate everything in January."

## Here's what Harris and Trump have said about easing costs for families

date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The high cost of caring for children and the elderly has forced women out of the workforce, devastated family finances, and left professional caretakers in low-wage jobs — all while slowing economic growth. 


That families are suffering is not up for debate. As the economy emerges as a theme in this presidential election, the Democratic and Republican candidates have sketched out ideas for easing costs that reveal their divergent views about family. 


On this topic, the two tickets have one main commonality: Both of the presidential candidates — and their running mates — have, at one point or another, backed an expanded child tax credit. 


Vice President Kamala Harris, who accepted the Democratic Party's nomination last week, has signaled that she plans to build on the ambitions of outgoing President Joe Biden's administration, which sought to pour billions in taxpayer dollars into making child care and home care for elderly and disabled adults more affordable. She has not etched any of those plans into a formal policy platform. But in a speech earlier this month, she said her vision included raising the child tax credit. 


Former President Donald Trump, the Republican, has declined to answer questions about how he would make child care more affordable, even though it was an issue he tackled during his own administration. His running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has a long history of pushing policies that would encourage Americans to have families, floating ideas like giving parents votes for their children. Just this month, Vance said he wants to raise the child tax credit to $5,000. But Vance has opposed government spending on child care, arguing that many children benefit from having one parent at home as caretaker. 


The candidates' care agendas could figure prominently into their appeal to suburban women in swing states, a coveted demographic seen as key to victory in November. Women provide two-thirds of unpaid care work — valued at $1 trillion annually — and are disproportionately impacted when families can't find affordable care for their children or aging parents. And the cost of care is an urgent problem: Child care prices are rising faster than inflation. 


Kamala Harris: Increase child tax credit 


When Harris addressed the Democratic National Convention, she talked first about her own experience with child care. She was raised mostly by a single mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who worked long hours as a breast cancer researcher. Among the people who formed her family's support network was "Mrs. Shelton, who ran the day care below us and became a second mother." 


As vice president, Harris worked behind the scenes in Congress on Biden's proposals to establish national paid family leave, make prekindergarten universal, and invest billions in child care so families wouldn't pay more than 7% of their income. She announced, too, the administration's actions to lower copays for families using federal child care vouchers, and to raise wages for Medicaid-funded home health aides. Before that, her track record as a senator included pressing for greater labor rights for domestic workers, including nannies and home health aides who may be vulnerable to exploitation. 


This month at a community college in North Carolina, Harris outlined her campaign's economic agenda, which includes raising the child tax credit to as much as $3,600 and giving families of newborns even more — $6,000 for the child's first year. 


"That is a vital — vital year of critical development of a child, and the costs can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else," she told the audience. Her running mate selection of Tim Walz, who established paid leave and a child tax credit as governor of Minnesota, has also buoyed optimism among supporters. 


Donald Trump: Few specifics, but some past support 


For voters grappling with the high cost of child care, Trump has offered little in the way of solutions. During the June presidential debate, CNN moderator Jake Tapper twice asked Trump what he would do to lower child care costs. Both times, he failed to answer, instead pivoting to other topics. His campaign platform is similarly silent. It does tackle the cost of long-term care for the elderly, writing that Republicans would "support unpaid Family Caregivers through Tax Credits and reduced red tape." 


The silence marks a shift from his first campaign, when he pitched paid parental leave, though it was panned by critics because his proposal excluded fathers. When he reached the White House, the former president sought $1 billion for child care, plus a parental leave policy at the urging of his daughter and policy adviser, Ivanka Trump. Congress rejected both proposals, but Trump succeeded in doubling the child tax credit and establishing paid leave for federal employees. 


In his 2019 State of the Union address, Trump said he was "proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child." 


This year, there are signs that his administration might not pursue the same agenda, including his selection of Vance as a running mate. In 2021, before he joined the Senate, Vance co-authored an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal opposing a proposal to invest billions in child care to make it more affordable for families. He and his co-author said expanding child care subsidies would lead to "unhappier, unhealthier children" and that having fewer mothers contributing to the economy might be a worthwhile trade-off. 


Vance has floated policies that would make it easier for a family to live off of a single income, making it possible for some parents to stay home while their partners work. Along with his embrace of policies he calls pro-family, he has tagged people who do not have or want children as "sociopaths." He once derided Harris and other rising Democratic stars as "childless cat ladies," even though Harris has two stepchildren — they call her "Momala" — and no cats. 


Even without details about new care policies, Trump believes that families would ultimately get a better deal under his administration. 


The Trump-Vance campaign has attacked Harris' record on the economy and said the Biden administration's policies have only made things tougher for families, pointing to recent inflation. 


"Harris ... has proudly and repeatedly celebrated her role as Joe Biden's co-pilot on Bidenomics," said Karoline Leavitt, a campaign spokeswoman. "The basic necessities of food, gas and housing are less affordable, unemployment is rising, and Kamala doesn't seem to care."

## X platform suspended in Brazil amid Brazilian judge's feud with Musk

date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA

SAO PAULO — A Brazilian Supreme Court justice on Friday ordered the suspension of Elon Musk's social media giant X in Brazil after the tech billionaire refused to name a legal representative in the country, according to a copy of the decision seen by The Associated Press.


The move further escalates the monthslong feud between the two men over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. 


Justice Alexandre de Moraes had warned Musk on Wednesday night that X could be blocked in Brazil if he failed to comply with his order to name a representative. He set a 24-hour deadline. The company hasn't had a representative in the country since earlier this month. 


In his decision, de Moraes gave internet service providers and app stores five days to block access to X, and said the platform will remain blocked until it complies with his orders. He also said people or companies who use virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access X will be subject to daily fines of 50,000 reais ($8,900). 


"Elon Musk showed his total disrespect for Brazilian sovereignty and, in particular, for the judiciary, setting himself up as a true supranational entity and immune to the laws of each country," de Moraes wrote. 


Brazil is an important market for X, which has struggled with the loss of advertisers since Musk purchased the platform, formerly Twitter, in 2022. Market research group Emarketer says about 40 million Brazilians, roughly one-fifth of the population, access X at least once per month. 


X had posted on its official Global Government Affairs page late Thursday that it expected X to be shut down by de Moraes, "simply because we would not comply with his illegal orders to censor his political opponents." 


"When we attempted to defend ourselves in court, Judge de Moraes threatened our Brazilian legal representative with imprisonment. Even after she resigned, he froze all of her bank accounts," the company wrote. "Our challenges against his manifestly illegal actions were either dismissed or ignored. Judge de Moraes' colleagues on the Supreme Court are either unwilling or unable to stand up to him."


Musk characterizes judge as tyrant 


X has clashed with de Moraes over its reluctance to comply with orders to block users. 


Accounts that the platform previously has shut down on Brazilian orders include lawmakers affiliated with former President Jair Bolsonaro's right-wing party and activists accused of undermining Brazilian democracy. 


Musk, a self-proclaimed "free speech absolutist," has repeatedly claimed the justice's actions amount to censorship, and his argument has been echoed by Brazil's political right. He has often insulted de Moraes on his platform, characterizing him as a dictator and tyrant. 


De Moraes' defenders have said his actions aimed at X have been lawful, supported by most of the court's full bench and have served to protect democracy at a time in which it is imperiled. His order Friday is based on Brazilian law requiring foreign companies to have representation in the country so they can be notified when there are legal cases against them. 


Given that operators are aware of the widely publicized standoff and their obligation to comply with an order from de Moraes, plus the fact doing so isn't complicated, X could be offline as early as 12 hours after receiving their instructions, said Luca Belli, coordinator of the Technology and Society Center at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university in Rio de Janeiro. 


Other apps suspended in past


The shutdown is not unprecedented in Brazil. 


Lone Brazilian judges shut down Meta's WhatsApp, the nation's most widely used messaging app, several times in 2015 and 2016 when the company's refused to comply with police requests for user data. In 2022, de Moraes threatened the messaging app Telegram with a nationwide shutdown, arguing it had repeatedly ignored Brazilian authorities' requests to block profiles and provide information. He ordered Telegram to appoint a local representative; the company ultimately complied and stayed online. 


X and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in several countries — mostly authoritarian regimes such as Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, such as Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have also temporarily suspended X before, usually to quell dissent and unrest. Twitter was banned in Egypt after the Arab Spring uprisings, which some dubbed the "Twitter revolution," but it has since been restored.

## Microsoft quietly makes controversial Recall feature uninstallable

date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News

After spending a few months in complete radio silence about Recall, Microsoft finally emerged with a statement that its controversial feature will make a comeback later this year, in October, to be more precise. In preparation for the release, Microsoft quietly made a big change in Windows 11 version 24H2 on Copilot+ PCs, namely, adding the ability to uninstall Recall (via Deskmodder). ↫ Taras Buria Recall, a half-baked security nightmare of a feature trying to catch the AI hype train, uninstallable using a Windows 95-era Windows Features dialog, is a better summary of the current state of Windows than anything anyone could put into words. Nobody cares about Windows, least of all Microsoft, and I have the sneaking suspicion that could Microsoft get away with it, they would put the source code to large parts of the Windows platform on GitHub to &#8220;outsource&#8221; its development to the community and fire even more employees. Is anyone excited about new Windows releases? Is anyone looking forward to new features? Because it feels like every new releases, every new feature, just causes more dread, more exasperation, more what is it this time? than genuine excitement and happiness. Everything coming out of Microsoft when it comes to Windows ever since the release of Windows 11 is just&#8230; Sadness.

## NASA, ESA Missions Help Scientists Uncover How Solar Wind Gets Energy

## NSA releases copy of internal lecture delivered by computing giant Rear Adm. Grace Hopper

date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News

In one of the more unique public proactive transparency record releases for the National Security Agency (NSA) to date, NSA has released a digital copy of a lecture that then-Capt. Grace Hopper gave agency employees on August 19, 1982. The lecture, “Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People,” features Capt. Hopper discussing some of the potential future challenges of protecting information. She also provided valuable insight on leadership and her experiences breaking barriers in the fields of computer science and mathematics. ↫ NSA press release Digital preservation is about more than just code &#8211; it&#8217;s also about invaluable content like this. It seems rather uncouth to spend only a few lines on who Grace Hopper really is, since it&#8217;s your duty to know already, and she deserves a hell of a lot more than a few lines. If you don&#8217;t yet know who she is, her Wikipedia page is a good place to start. The speech in question has an interesting history, in that the only medium on which it was stored were 1-inch AMPEX tapes. The speech was originally given to NSA employees, but not even the damn NSA had the ability to access the recordings of the speech, and had to call in the National Archives and Records Administration&#8217;s help. The NARA managed to retrieve the footage from the tapes, and now here we are. This will make for some great weekend viewing.

## End of the road: an AnandTech farewell

date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News

I hate this timeline. It is with great sadness that I find myself penning the hardest news post I’ve ever needed to write here at AnandTech. After over 27 years of covering the wide – and wild – word of computing hardware, today is AnandTech’s final day of publication. For better or worse, we’ve reached the end of a long journey – one that started with a&#160;review of an AMD processor, and has ended with the&#160;review of an AMD processor. It’s fittingly poetic, but it is also a testament to the fact that we’ve spent the last 27 years doing what we love, covering the chips that are the lifeblood of the computing industry. ↫ Ryan Smith at AnandTech This sudden loss is sending shockwaves through the industry, and rightfully so. AnandTech is a pillar, a cornerstone of hardware reporting, and one of the very few &#8211; possibly only &#8211; tech news outlet out there with such depth, quality, integrity, and restraint. I can&#8217;t think of any other outlet being as dedicated to proper benchmarking and hardware reviews as AnandTech was, and losing them is a huge loss for all of us. The cause is exactly what you&#8217;d expect, sadly. It&#8217;s simply not really possible to remain profitable writing in-depth hardware reviews and benchmarks, as the world has shifted to video, and advertising income has cratered. There&#8217;s tons of hints about AnandTech not wanting to embrace sensationalism and clickbaiting to increase revenue &#8211; they&#8217;d rather go out with class, and I admire and appreciate that greatly. It just goes to show how hard it is to keep your head above water in the current online publishing world without rampant clickbaiting and flashy videos. In a better, less monopolised world, AnandTech could thrive. Sadly, that&#8217;s not the timeline we&#8217;re in. As far as housekeeping goes, the site will remain up for now, but there&#8217;s no guarantee it&#8217;ll stay up forever. I&#8217;m sure countless people are already archiving the invaluable content AnandTech has produced over its 27 year run, including the forums. We shan&#8217;t lose what AnandTech has created.

Individual projects would still need to be authorized through site-specific environmental reviews and public comment periods.

Asked if she stood by her 2019 statement that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” Harris stressed, “As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” Harris said her “values have not changed” and that “we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate,” but that she has become convinced “we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.”

</p><h3>3. It’s official: This summer was disgusting</h3><p>
	Saturday, August 31, marks the end of meteorological summer (even if real ones know summer doesn’t end 
	<em>spiritually</em> until <a href="https://link.nymag.com/view/56fc5ac818ff434d738c9cc8lp08n.lrz/d6d99e2d?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8E7TrnYlqWRk7xLLgLhNF5NOW4jDsLf-x3Ezi31axOBDeJHBBIc2lMrrDwc12l6qNPShR_" target="_blank">next Tuesday</a> and astronomically until the 22nd). And yes, this was another one for the books: Specifically, summer 2024 was the most humid in 85 years of record-keeping, and likely the most humid summer on Earth, as well, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/08/29/record-humidity-united-states-earth/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8E7TrnYlqWRk7xLLgLhNF5NOW4jDsLf-x3Ezi31axOBDeJHBBIc2lMrrDwc12l6qNPShR_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Washington Post</em> reports</a> based on calculations by the climate scientist Brian Brettschneider.
</p><p>
	“June 2024 and July 2024 both set records for highest dew point for their respective months,” Brettschneider told the 
	<em>Post</em>. “I expect August 2024 to be a record too. Summer 2024 should break the record set in summer 2023.” Humidity notably makes extreme heat more dangerous, a process that is <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/02/01/extreme-weather-worsening-climate-change-study?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8E7TrnYlqWRk7xLLgLhNF5NOW4jDsLf-x3Ezi31axOBDeJHBBIc2lMrrDwc12l6qNPShR_" target="_blank">accelerating</a> because warmer air caused by climate change can hold more moisture.
</p><h3>4. More than half of Americans would back a permitting reform compromise</h3><p>
			Just over half of Americans (52%) would support a bipartisan law that made it easier to build new clean energy projects and benefit some oil and gas development, a new poll by Heatmap has found. “That’s good news for one of the last remaining pieces of environmental policy that Congress could pass under this presidency: a bipartisan proposal from Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso that would speed up the process of building climate-friendly infrastructure in exchange for concessions to the oil and gas industry,”

			At least seven teenage athletes have died in the U.S. in August during or immediately after football practice, with experts saying extreme heat may be to blame. Three of the deaths — 15-year-old Javion Taylor of central Virginia; 14-year-old Semaj Wilkins of Alabama; and 16-year-old Junior Leslie Noble of Maryland — <a href="https://www.kcur.org/sports/2024-08-29/football-player-deaths-august-summer-practice-shawnee-mission-northwest?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8E7TrnYlqWRk7xLLgLhNF5NOW4jDsLf-x3Ezi31axOBDeJHBBIc2lMrrDwc12l6qNPShR_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were linked to heat</a>, while others involved traumatic head injuries. But heat can also increase the risk of brain injuries, Kei Katawa, an assistant professor of clinical neuroscience at Indiana University Bloomington, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5090146/alabamas-school-year-begins-with-tragedy-after-2-football-players-die?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8E7TrnYlqWRk7xLLgLhNF5NOW4jDsLf-x3Ezi31axOBDeJHBBIc2lMrrDwc12l6qNPShR_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told NPR</a>. “At that point, your brain [already has] asymptomatic heat exhaustion — pre-heat exhaustion. And then on top of that, you sustain head impact. It has a potential of amplifying head impact effect,” he said.

## Only You (and AI) Can Prevent Wildfires

date: 2024-08-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU2OTk5Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyODY1NjMwMn0.F1ik6C0BNRCOKONbpfcPl_D_FjyXU2CZm0hABsdXBHM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">In a warming world where winter snow is melting earlier and rain is arriving later, “<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/the-last-fire-season-manjula-martin" target="_self"><u>wildfire season</u></a>” has become somewhat of a misnomer. Some parts of the country now see blazes popping up practically year round. This, combined with decades of fire management policy that promoted suppression over natural and controlled burns, has turned certain states — California, most famously — into tinderboxes.<br/></p><p>With wildfire smoke becoming a standard component of Silicon Valley summers, it’s probably no surprise that numerous data analytics and artificial intelligence-focused startups have sprung up to address the issue. There’s even a San Francisco-based venture capital firm, Convective Capital, devoted solely to funding wildfire solutions. </p><p>“My big question coming into starting Convective was, are there enough companies in this category?” Bill Clerico, founder and managing partner of the firm told me. The answer, he found, was yes. After establishing Convective Capital in the beginning of 2022, he said, “we’ve identified about 500 of what we call fire tech companies.” They run the gamut from startups that work on wildfire suppression to those dealing with identification, prevention, mitigation, and insurance against damages. </p><p>Rhizome, a company making an AI-powered wildfire risk mitigation platform for utilities, is one of the firm’s most recent investments. “Think of it as Sim City for the grid,” Mishal Thadani, CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based startup, told me. “You obviously need to know, as extreme weather events hit, how this is going to affect your assets,” he explained. </p><p>Rhizome’s platform gives utilities insight into, “if there is an asset failure, given the asset type, the type of failure, and the burn probability given the vegetation makeup and the dryness conditions, what’s going to be the likelihood of a wildfire ignition?” This information helps utilities decide where to put their money, whether that means replacing a power line or pole, insulating conductors, undergrounding power lines, or trimming back a bush. Last month, Rhizome announced a $1 million investment from Convective Capital, not tied to a particular funding round. The company raised <a href="https://www.rhizomedata.com/news/rhizome-grid-resilience-launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2.5 million</u></a> in its pre-seed round last year.</p><p>The problem is not simply a lack of data, Thadani told me — utilities often know things about their assets such as last inspection date and outage history, and have systems that can render the surrounding landscape and other infrastructural features. The problem is that data is not part of a holistic system that can provide comprehensive insights. If risk analysis is being performed, Thadani said, “it’s being done on a super scrappy spreadsheet basis.”</p><p>Rhizome aims to build the “connective tissue” between a utility’s disparate data systems, then combine that with other geographic datasets on climate, weather, and vegetation. From there, the company uses its machine learning models to assess the likelihood of extreme weather events and their subsequent impacts. Ultimately, this allows utilities to provide regulators with more quantifiable information on their plans to improve grid resiliency and prevent wildfires, beyond just citing a figure for how much money they want to spend.</p><p>Utilities are not exactly known for their technical prowess, but are hungry nevertheless for solutions to their wildfire woes. Pacific Gas & Electric, the nation’s largest utility, was driven into bankruptcy after being found liable for a spate of enormous California wildfires in 2017 and 2018. After reemerging from bankruptcy in 2020, it now has a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-27/pg-e-pledges-18-billion-to-cut-wildfire-risk-in-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>plan to spend $18 billion</u></a> on wildfire mitigation through 2025. Other utilities such as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hawaiian-electric-nears-wildfire-settlement-aiming-to-avoid-pg-es-bankruptcy-fate-513a3846" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hawaii Electric</u></a> and <a href="https://newsletter.rationalwalk.com/p/berkshire-hathaway-energys-uncertain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Berkshire Hathaway Energy</u></a> face billions in potential liabilities for wildfires in their service areas. </p><p>The most common customers for companies in Convective Capital’s portfolio are utilities, governments, and insurance companies. “These are tremendously deep-pocketed institutions, but they are not, you know, necessarily the most fast-moving or innovative,” he told me. “And so that is the fundamental challenge of building a wildfire technology company.”</p><p>So far, Rhizome has announced partnerships with two utilities, Seattle City Light and Vermont Electric Power Company. But Clerico acknowledges that getting traditional institutions onboard is no easy task, even when the benefits seem clear. The magnitude of the destruction in recent years <em><em>has</em></em> served as an accelerant, though — something the vegetation management platform provider AiDash has seen first hand. Abhishek Singh, cofounder and CEO of the startup (which is not in Convective’s portfolio), said that when he founded the company in 2019, “Every investor warned us not to do this because utilities don’t buy and they won’t invest.” But that’s not what he’s experienced. </p><p>AiDash <a href="https://www.aidash.com/news/aidash-closes-its-oversubscribed-series-c-funding-round-at-58-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>raised $58.5 million</u></a> in an oversubscribed Series C round earlier this year, led by the impact investor Lightrock, and has five utility partnerships, including Southern California Edison’s holding company, Edison International, as well as Duke Energy. The company uses satellite data and AI analytics to assess vegetation near utility infrastructure for wildfire risk. It can also detect faults by fusing satellite data with other sources such as thermal or LiDAR-based imagery. (Convective Capital sees the value proposition in using satellites for vegetation management, too — it’s invested in one of AiDash’s direct competitors, an Amsterdam-based startup called Overstory.)</p><p>When Singh founded AiDash in 2019, both the size and cost of satellites were plummeting, leading to far more launches and thus far more data. . “Since the history of the first satellite until 2018, there were 2,200-odd satellites launched,” he told me. “From 2019 onwards, each year close to 1,000 satellites are getting launched.” The company purchases mounds of that data to conduct its vegetation analyses. </p><p>Vegetation management is typically the largest line item in a utility’s operations and maintenance budgets, Singh told me, costing the entire sector around $6 billion or $7 billion annually. “It’s also the single largest cause of utility-caused wildfires, as well as the cause of most outages,” he said, as power lines coming into contact with trees, grasses, and shrubs can easily spark a fire. Anything that can help them trim that budget and preempt the need for costly equipment repairs is worth a lot. “These are all million dollar contracts,” Singh told me.</p><p>But big data platforms alone are just one tool in the vast toolbox that comprises a holistic approach to wildfire management. “There’s no panacea, where you just do one thing and then it solves the problem,” Clerico told me. “It’s going to get solved as a combination of consistent and repeated forest management, building towns and cities that are fire adapted, building great infrastructure, and then having the ability to detect and respond quickly. All of these things are huge, multi decade, multi billion dollar investments.” </p><p>So for the foreseeable future, Convective Capital will have its work cut out for it. But when I asked Clerico if one day, in a beautiful, far-off dreamland, there might not be the need for a dedicated wildfire tech VC, he said he hopes so.</p>

## Panama deports Ecuadorean migrants in second US-backed flight

date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA

PANAMA CITY — Panamanian authorities deported a group of migrants to Ecuador on a second flight financed by the United States, as part of an agreement between the U.S. and Panama to discourage irregular crossings and reduce the flow of mostly U.S.-bound migration.


The flight carrying 30 Ecuadoreans departed on Thursday evening en route to the coastal city of Manta, Ecuador, Panama's migration service said, adding the migrants were deported for evading a migration checkpoint on the popular Darien Gap route.


Thousands of people every year cross the dangerous Darien Gap jungle on Panama's border with Colombia on the way to the United States.


The flight on Thursday followed a maiden journey financed by Washington in mid-August, which returned around 30 migrants to Colombia.


The latest deportation comes days after Panama's President Jose Mulino announced return flights for Indian migrants in September and for Chinese citizens on an unspecified date.

## NY nonprofit reclaims centuries-old cemetery for enslaved people

date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA

KINGSTON, New York — On a residential block in upstate New York, college students dug and sifted backyard dirt as part of an archeological exploration this summer of a centuries-old cemetery for African Americans.


Now covered with green lawns in the city of Kingston, this spot in 1750 was part of a burial ground for people who were enslaved. It was located on what was then the outskirts of town. An unknown number of people who were denied church burials were interred here until the late 19th century, when the cemetery was covered over as the city grew.


The site is now being reclaimed as the Pine Street African Burial Ground, one of many forgotten or neglected cemeteries for African Americans getting fresh attention. In the last three summers, the remains of up to 27 people have been located here.


Advocates in this Hudson River city purchased a residential property covering about half the old cemetery several years ago and now use the house there as a visitor center. Money is being raised to turn the urban backyard into a respectful resting place. And while the names of people buried here may be lost, tests are planned on their remains to shed light on their lives and identify their descendants.


"The hardships of those buried here cannot just go down in vain," said Tyrone Wilson, founder of Harambee Kingston, the nonprofit community group behind the project. "We have a responsibility to make sure that we fix that disrespect."


While the more-than-0.2 hectares site was designated as a cemetery for people who were enslaved in 1750, it might have been in use before then. Burials continued through about 1878, more than 50 years after New York fully abolished slavery. Researchers say people were buried with their feet to the east, so when they rise on Judgment Day they would face the rising sun.


Remains found on the Harambee property are covered with patterned African cloths and kept where they are. Remains found on adjoining land are exhumed for later burial on the Harambee property.




Students from the State University of New York at New Paltz recently finished a third summer of supervised backyard excavations in this city 129 kilometers upriver from Manhattan. The students get course credit, though anthropology major Maddy Thomas said there's an overriding sense of mission.


"I don’t like when people feel upset or forgotten," Thomas said on a break. "And that is what’s happened here. So we’ve got to fix it."


Harambee is trying to raise $1 million to transform the modest backyard into resting spot that reflects the African heritage of the people buried there. Plans include a tall marker in the middle of the yard.


While some graves were apparently marked, it's still hard to say who was buried there.


"Some of them, it’s obvious, were marked with just a stone with no writing on it," said Joseph Diamond, associate professor of anthropology at New Paltz.


The only intact headstone recovered with a name visible was for Caezar Smith, who was born enslaved and died a free man in 1839 at age 41. A researcher mined historical records and came up with two more people potentially buried there in 1803: a man identified as Sam and a 16-year-old girl named Deyon who was publicly hanged after being convicted of murdering the 6-year-old daughter of her enslavers.


The cemetery was at first covered by a lumberyard by 1880, even though some gravestones were apparently still standing by that date.


In 1990, Diamond was doing an archaeological survey for the city and noticed the cemetery was marked on a map from 1870. He and the city historian went out to find it.


Coincidentally, Pine Street building owner Andrew Kirschner had just discovered buried bone chips while digging in front of the building in search of a sewer pipe. He put the pieces in a box. Kirschner said he was still digging when Diamond told him what they were looking for.


"The conversation begins and then I go, ‘Well, let me show you what I found.’ Of course, they were amazed," said Kirschner, who had owned the building next to the current Harambee property.




Even after the discovery, Diamond said it was difficult to convince people there were graves on Pine Street. There were even plans in 1996 to build a parking lot over much of the site. Advocates purchased the property in 2019.


Similar stories of disregard and rediscovery have played out elsewhere.


In Manhattan, the African Burial Ground National Monument marks the site where an estimated 15,000 free and enslaved Africans were buried until the 1790s. It was discovered in 1991 during excavations for a federal building. Farther up the Hudson River, the renovation in Newburgh of a century-old school into a courthouse in 2008 led to the discovery of more than 100 sets of remains.


Antoinette Jackson, founder of The Black Cemetery Network, said many of the 169 sites listed in their online archive had been erased.


"A good deal of them represent sites that have been built over — by parking lots, schools, stadiums, highways. Others have been under-resourced," said Jackson, a professor of anthropology at the University of Southern Florida.


She added that the cemeteries listed on the archive are just the "tip of the iceberg."


Given the meager historical record in Kingston, advocates hope tests on the remains will help fill in some gaps. Isotopic analyses could provide information on whether individuals grew up elsewhere — like South Carolina or Africa — and then moved to the region. DNA analyses could provide information on where in Africa their ancestors came from. The DNA tests also might be able to link them to living descendants.


Wilson said local families have committed to providing DNA samples. He sees the tests as another way to connect people to heritage.


"One of the biggest issues that we have in African culture is that we don’t know our history," he said. "We don’t have a lot of information of who we are."

## Trump asks federal court to intervene in hush money case

date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA

new york — Donald Trump asked a federal court late Thursday to intervene in his New York hush money criminal case, seeking a pathway to overturn his felony conviction and indefinitely delay his sentencing scheduled for next month.


Lawyers for the former president and current Republican nominee asked the federal court in Manhattan to seize the case from the state court where it was brought and tried, arguing that the historic prosecution violated Trump's constitutional rights and ran afoul of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity.


Trump's lawyers said moving the case to federal court following his May 30 conviction will give him an "unbiased forum, free from local hostilities" to address those issues. If the case is moved to federal court, Trump lawyers wrote, they will then seek to have the verdict overturned and the case dismissed. If it remains in state court, with sentencing proceeding as scheduled, it could amount to election interference, they said.


"The ongoing proceedings will continue to cause direct and irreparable harm to President Trump — the leading candidate in the 2024 Presidential election — and voters located far beyond Manhattan," Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in a 64-page U.S. District Court filing.


Trump was convicted in state court in Manhattan of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a payment to bury affair allegations that threatened to cloud his 2016 presidential run. Even if the case isn't moved to federal court, the potential delay caused by litigation surrounding Trump's effort could give him a critical reprieve as he navigates the aftermath of his criminal conviction and the homestretch of his presidential campaign.


Separately, the state court judge who presided over the trial, Juan M. Merchan, is weighing Trump's requests to postpone sentencing until after Election Day, November 5, and to overturn the verdict and dismiss the case in the wake of the Supreme Court's immunity decision.


The high court's July 1 ruling reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to official acts as evidence that a president's unofficial actions were illegal.


Trump's lawyers argue that in light of the ruling, jurors in the hush money case should not have heard such evidence as former White House staffers describing how the then-president reacted to news coverage of the deal to pay hush money to porn actor Stormy Daniels.


Trump's lawyers had previously invoked presidential immunity in a failed bid last year to get the hush money case moved from state court to federal court. A federal judge rejected that request, clearing the way for Trump's historic trial in state court.


U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump's claim that allegations in the hush money indictment involved official duties, writing in July 2023, "The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely a personal item of the president — a cover-up of an embarrassing event."


"Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a president's official acts. It does not reflect in any way the color of the president's official duties," Hellerstein added.


A message seeking comment was left with the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case.

## Harris vows tougher approach on migration, supports weapons for Israel

date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA

savannah, georgia/washington — Kamala Harris vowed a tougher approach to migration along the U.S. southern border and said she would not withhold weapons to Israel, in her first interview with a major news organization since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.


In the interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash, Harris sought to show she is in command of the issues and give Americans a sense of her policy positions with little more than two months until Election Day on November 5.


Harris said she would renew a push for comprehensive border legislation that would tighten migration into the United States and vowed to "enforce our laws" against border crossings.


"We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequence," Harris said.


She also hewed closely to President Joe Biden's strong support of Israel and rejected calls from some in the Democratic Party that Washington should rethink sending weapons to Israel because of the heavy Palestinian death toll in Gaza.


She said she supports a strong Israel but "we must get a deal done" to get a cease-fire in the Gaza conflict.


"No, we have to get a (cease-fire and hostage) deal done," Harris said when asked if she would withhold weapons to Israel. She has been Biden's vice president since the start of his administration.


Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement that has protested against Biden's policy, expressed frustration over Harris’ response on Gaza.


"If the vice president is interested in a cease-fire, she must support an immediate stop to sending the fire," Alawieh said.


Harris, joined by her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, also said she would like to add a Republican to her cabinet if she wins the election.


"I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican," she said. 




Surging in polls


Since becoming the Democratic candidate for president last month, Harris has surged in the polls, brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign donations, and had a series of forceful campaign speeches.


She leads Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among voters.


Some critics suggested she might be less polished in unscripted settings like a TV interview, but she appeared to make no major mistakes on Thursday.


Harris defended her and Biden's handling of inflation, saying they inherited a pandemic-ravaged economy that she said Trump had mismanaged. She said much work had been done to lower prices but that "prices are still too high."


Jeremi Suri, history and public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said Harris came across as knowledgeable and a "consensus builder" in the interview but she could have had "more concrete and specific answers" on what she would do on her first day as president.


Harris has moved more toward the center on some issues from the time she ran for president in 2020 until she took over from Biden last month as the Democrats' choice to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the election.


She has toughened her position on migration along the southern U.S. border with Mexico. She also no longer wants a ban on fracking, an energy production method that employs many people in Pennsylvania, one of a handful of swing states that could decide the election.


When asked about her policy shifts, Harris said: "My values have not changed."


Harris dismissed a comment from Trump in which he questioned whether she was a Black American. "Same old tired playbook," she said. "Next question, please."


Trump, in a post on Truth Social, responded to the interview by saying: "I look so forward to Debating Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is." Trump often falsely refers to Harris as a Marxist.


Though she has taken questions from journalists on the campaign trail and been interviewed on TikTok in recent days, she had, until Thursday, not done a one-on-one interview with a major network or print journalist since Biden ended his reelection campaign on July 21 and endorsed her.


Bash, who co-moderated the June 27 debate between Trump and Biden that ultimately led to the president's departure from the race, conducted the interview in Savannah, Georgia, as Harris and Walz were on a campaign bus tour.


Harris widens lead over Trump with boost from women, Hispanics, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds.
