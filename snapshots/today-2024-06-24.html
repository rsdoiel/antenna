<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has made OneDrive slightly more annoying for Windows 11
users. Quietly and without any announcement, the company changed Windows
11’s initial setup so that it could turn on the automatic folder backup
without asking for it. Now, those setting up a new Windows computer the
way Microsoft wants them to (in other words, connected to the internet
and signed into a Microsoft account) will get to their desktops with
OneDrive already syncing stuff from folders like Desktop Pictures,
Documents, Music, and Videos. Depending on how much is stored there, you
might end up with a desktop and other folders filled to the brim with
shortcuts to various stuff right after finishing a clean Windows
installation. ↫ Taras Buria at NeoWin Just further confirmation that
Windows 11 is not ready for the desktop.</p>

id="trump-attorney-takes-aim-at-funding-of-classified-documents-prosecution">Trump
attorney takes aim at funding of classified documents prosecution</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT PIERCE, Florida — An attorney for Donald Trump told a federal
judge on Monday that the criminal prosecution against the former
president on charges he mishandled classified documents was unlawfully
funded, as they made another attempt to get the charges thrown out of
court. </p>
<p>Prosecutors told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that the funding
mechanism for their office has been upheld in past cases, as they sought
to work through a thicket of legal challenges that have delayed the
trial indefinitely. </p>
<p>Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he illegally held on to
sensitive national security papers after leaving office in 2021 and that
he obstructed government efforts to retrieve them. The criminal case is
one of four Trump has been facing as he seeks to unseat Democratic
President Joe Biden in the November 5 election. </p>
<p>Cannon, a Trump appointee, set hearings on Friday and Monday in her
Florida courtroom for Trump’s lawyers to argue several motions making
claims similar to those that have been rejected in other cases. On
Friday, Trump attorneys urged her to find U.S. special counsel Jack
Smith has too much independence - even though Trump has repeatedly
blasted him as a puppet of Biden. </p>
<p>On Monday, Trump lawyer Emil Bove said the U.S. Justice Department
should not be allowed to use a fund Congress set aside in the 1970s for
independent politically sensitive investigations to pay for the
documents probe. </p>
<p>“More oversight from Congress is required for the extraordinary
things that are going on in these prosecutions,” Bove said. Some
Republicans in the House of Representatives have called for defunding
Smith’s office. </p>
<p>Special counsels have been appointed in Democratic- and
Republican-led administrations alike to ensure an attorney can
independently investigate and, if warranted, prosecute a case without
any appearance of political influence. </p>
<p>U.S. prosecutor James Pearce told Cannon that the funding had been
upheld in previous court cases that challenged other special prosecutors
- including David Weiss, who recently won a criminal conviction of
Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. </p>
<p>Pearce said the Justice Department would fund Smith’s office out of
its regular budget if Cannon ruled that it cannot rely on the 1970s
law. </p>
<p>Cannon has allowed a flurry of motions by Trump’s legal team and has
ruled in favor of the Republican presidential candidate on previous
requests. It is unlikely the case will reach a jury before Trump and
Biden face voters in the election. </p>
<p>Gag order request </p>
<p>Smith’s team was due to ask Cannon later on Monday to bar Trump from
making statements that pose a threat to law enforcement while he awaits
trial. </p>
<p>Trump falsely claimed that a routine FBI use-of-force policy in
effect during a 2022 search of his Florida resort authorized agents to
attempt an assassination. </p>
<p>Prosecutors called the claim “deceptive and inflammatory” in a court
filing and said it subjected agents to “unjustified and unacceptable
risks.” </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers say a gag order  would violate Trump’s free-speech
rights in the heat of the presidential campaign. They also argue that
prosecutors have not presented evidence of threats against the FBI. </p>
<p>Cannon previously denied the request on procedural grounds after she
ruled that prosecutors had not adequately consulted with Trump’s lawyers
before filing it. </p>
<p>Trump faces gag orders limiting his public statements in another
federal case, also overseen by Smith, accusing him of attempting to
overturn his defeat in the 2020 election, and a case in New York that
led to his conviction in May for falsifying business records. </p>
<p>Trump has verbally attacked prosecutors, judges and witnesses in
legal cases against him, contending that the U.S. justice system is
being used to undermine his campaign. </p>
<p>Trump’s criticism of the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago social club
intensified last month after the bureau’s use-of-force policy was made
public as part of a tranche of records related to the FBI
operation. </p>
<p>The policy stipulated that the FBI could not use lethal force unless
an agent or other person was at serious risk of death or serious injury.
Trump was not present at the club at the time of the search. </p>
<p>Trump’s baseless claim about an attempted assassination was included
in campaign fundraising emails and was echoed by his allies in
Congress.</p>

id="lawsuit-challenges-new-louisiana-law-requiring-classrooms-to-display-ten-commandments">Lawsuit
challenges new Louisiana law requiring classrooms to display Ten
Commandments</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — Civil liberties groups filed a lawsuit
Monday to block Louisiana’s new law that requires the Ten Commandments
to be displayed in every public school classroom, a measure they contend
is unconstitutional. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs in the suit include parents of Louisiana public
schoolchildren, represented by attorneys with the American Civil
Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State,
and the Freedom From Religion Foundation. </p>
<p>“This display sends a message to my children and other students that
people of some religious denominations are superior to others,” said the
Rev. Jeff Simms, a Presbyterian pastor who is a plaintiff in the suit
and father of three children in Louisiana public schools. “This is
religious favoritism.” </p>
<p>Under the legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Jeff Landry
last week, all public K-12 classrooms and state-funded universities will
be required to display a poster-sized version of the Ten Commandments in
“large, easily readable font” next year. </p>
<p>Opponents argue that the law is a violation of separation of church
and state and that the display will isolate students, especially those
who are not Christian. Proponents say the measure is not solely
religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of
the law, the Ten Commandments are “foundational documents of our state
and national government.” </p>
<p>Plaintiff Joshua Herlands has two young children in New Orleans
public schools who, like their father, are Jewish. There are multiple
versions of the Ten Commandments, and Herlands said the specific version
mandated for classroom walls does not align with the version from his
faith. He worries the display will send a troubling message to his kids
and others that “they may be lesser in the eyes of the government.” </p>
<p>“Politicians have absolutely no business forcing their religious
beliefs on my kids or any kids, or attempting to indoctrinate them with
what they think is the right version of a particular piece of religious
text,” Herlands said. </p>
<p>The lawsuit filed Monday seeks a court declaration that the new law,
referred to in the lawsuit as HB 71, violates First Amendment clauses
forbidding government establishment of religion and guaranteeing
religious liberty. It also seeks an order prohibiting the posting of the
Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. </p>
<p>“The state’s main interest in passing H.B. 71 was to impose religious
beliefs on public-school children, regardless of the harm to students
and families,” the lawsuit says. “The law’s primary sponsor and author,
Representative Dodie Horton, proclaimed during debate over the bill that
it ‘seeks to have a display of God’s law in the classroom for children
to see what He says is right and what He says is wrong.’” </p>
<p>Defendants include state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley,
members of the state education board and some local school boards. </p>
<p>Landry and Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill support the
new law, and Murrill has said she is looking forward to defending it.
She issued a statement saying she couldn’t comment directly on the
lawsuit because she had not yet seen it. </p>
<p>“It seems the ACLU only selectively cares about the First Amendment —
it doesn’t care when the Biden administration censors speech or arrests
pro-life protesters, but apparently it will fight to prevent posters
that discuss our own legal history,” Murrill said in the emailed
statement. </p>
<p>The Ten Commandments have long been at the center of lawsuits across
the nation. </p>
<p>In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law
violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says
Congress can “make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” The
high court found that the law had no secular purpose but rather served a
plainly religious purpose. </p>
<p>In a more recent ruling, the Supreme Court held in 2005 that such
displays in a pair of Kentucky courthouses violated the Constitution. At
the same time, the court upheld a Ten Commandments marker on the grounds
of the Texas state Capitol in Austin. Those were 5-4 decisions, but the
court’s makeup has changed, with a 6-3 conservative majority now. </p>
<p>Other states, including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah, have attempted to
pass requirements that the schools display the Ten Commandments.
However, with threats of legal battles, none has the mandate in place
except for Louisiana. </p>
<p>The posters in Louisiana, which will be paired with a four-paragraph
“context statement” describing how the Ten Commandments “were a
prominent part of public education for almost three centuries,” must be
in place in classrooms by the start of 2025. </p>
<p>The controversial law comes during a new era of conservative
leadership in Louisiana under Landry, who replaced two-term Democratic
Gov. John Bel Edwards in January. The GOP holds a supermajority in the
Legislature, and Republicans hold every statewide elected position,
paving the way for lawmakers to push through a conservative agenda. </p>
<p>The case was allotted to U.S. District Judge John deGravelles,
nominated to the federal bench by former President Barack Obama.</p>

American car dealerships in revert to pens and paper after
cyberattacks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Car dealerships in North America continue to wrestle with
major disruptions that started last week with cyberattacks on a software
company used widely in the auto retail sales sector. </p>
<p>CDK Global, a company that provides software for thousands of auto
dealers in the U.S. and Canada, was hit by back-to-back cyberattacks
Wednesday. That led to an outage that has continued to impact
operations. </p>
<p>For prospective car buyers, that has meant delays at dealerships or
vehicle orders written up by hand. There’s no immediate end in sight,
with CDK saying it expects the restoration process to take “several
days” to complete. </p>
<p>On Monday, Group 1 Automotive Inc., a $4 billion automotive retailer,
said that it continued to use “alternative processes” to sell cars to
its customers. Lithia Motors and AutoNation, two other dealership
chains, also disclosed that they implemented workarounds to keep their
operations going. </p>
<p>Here is what you need to know. </p>
<p>What is CDK Global? </p>
<p>CDK Global is a major player in the auto sales industry. The company,
based just outside of Chicago in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, provides
software technology to dealers that helps with day-to-day operations —
like facilitating vehicle sales, financing, insurance and repairs. </p>
<p>CDK serves more than 15,000 retail locations across North America,
according to the company. </p>
<p>What happened last week? </p>
<p>CDK experienced back-to-back cyberattacks on Wednesday. The company
shut down all of its systems out of an abundance of caution,
spokesperson Lisa Finney said last week. </p>
<p>“We have begun the restoration process,” Finney said in an update
over the weekend — noting that the company had launched an investigation
into the “cyber incident” with third-party experts and notified law
enforcement. </p>
<p>“Based on the information we have at this time, we anticipate that
the process will take several days to complete, and in the interim we
are continuing to actively engage with our customers and provide them
with alternate ways to conduct business,” she added. </p>
<p>In messages to its customers, the company has also warned of “bad
actors” posing as members or affiliates of CDK to try to obtain system
access by contacting customers. It urged them to be cautious of any
attempted phishing. </p>
<p>The incident bore all the hallmarks of a ransomware attack, in which
targets are asked to pay a ransom to access encrypted files. But CDK
declined to comment directly — neither confirming or denying if it had
received a ransom demand. </p>
<p>Are impacted dealerships still selling cars? </p>
<p>Several major auto companies — including Stellantis, Ford and BMW —
confirmed to The Associated Press last week that the CDK outage had
impacted some of their dealers, but that sales operations continue. </p>
<p>In light of the ongoing situation, a spokesperson for Stellantis said
Friday that many dealerships had switched to manual processes to serve
customers. That includes writing up orders by hand. </p>
<p>A Ford spokesperson added that the outage may cause “some delays and
inconveniences at some dealers and for some customers.” However, many
Ford and Lincoln customers are still getting sales and service support
through alternative routes being used at dealerships. </p>
<p>Group 1 Automotive Inc., which owns 202 automotive dealerships, 264
franchises, and 42 collision centers in the U.S. and the United Kingdom,
said Monday that the incident has disrupted its business applications
and processes in its U.S. operations that rely on CDK’s dealers’
systems. The company said that it took measures to protect and isolate
its systems from CDK’s platform. </p>
<p>All Group 1 U.S. dealerships will continue to conduct business using
alternative processes until CDK’s dealers’ systems are available, the
company said Monday. Group 1’s dealerships in the U.K. don’t use CDK’s
dealers’ systems and are not impacted by the incident. </p>
<p>In regulatory filings, Lithia Motors and AutoNation disclosed that
last week’s incident at CDK had disrupted their operations as well. </p>
<p>Lithia said it activated cyber incident response procedures, which
included “severing business service connections between the company’s
systems and CDK’s.” AutoNation said it also took steps to protect its
systems and data — adding that all of its locations remain open “albeit
with lower productivity,” as many are served manually or through
alternative processes. </p>
<p>With many details of the cyberattacks still unclear, customer privacy
is also at top of mind — especially with little known about what
information may have been compromised this week. </p>
<p>In a statement last week, Mike Stanton, president and CEO of the
National Automobile Dealers Association, said “dealers are very
committed to protecting their customer information” and were seeking
updates from CDK to determine the scope of impact “so they can respond
appropriately.” </p>
<p>Cybersecurity experts have stressed that consumers connected to CDK
(or a CDK-affilated dealership) should assume that their data may have
been breached. Those impacted should monitor their credit — or even
consider freezing their credit as an added layer of defense — and be
wary of any suspicious phishing messages.</p>

<h2 id="apple-first-company-to-be-found-violating-dma">Apple first
company to be found violating DMA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, the European Commission has informed Apple of its preliminary
view that its App Store rules are in breach of the Digital Markets Act
(DMA), as they prevent app developers from freely steering consumers to
alternative channels for offers and content. In addition, the Commission
opened a new non-compliance procedure against Apple over concerns that
its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app
stores, including Apple’s new “Core Technology Fee”, fall short of
ensuring effective compliance with Apple’s obligations under the DMA. ↫
European Commission press release File this in the category for entirely
expected news that is the opposite of surprising. Apple has barely even
been maliciously compliant with the DMA, and the European Commission is
entirely right in pursuing the company for its continued violation of
the law. The DMA really isn’t a very complicated law, and the fact the
world’s most powerful and wealthiest corporation in the world can’t seem
to adapt its products to the privacy and competition laws here in the EU
is clearly just a bunch of grandstanding and whining. In fact, I find
that the European Commission is remarkably lenient and cooperative in
its dealings with the major technology giants in general, and Apple in
particular. They’ve been in talks with Apple for a long time now in
preparation for the DMA, the highest-ranking EU officials regularly
talked with Apple and Tim Cook, they’ve been given ample warnings,
instructions, and additional time to make sure their products do not
violate the law – as a European Union citizen, I can tell you no small
to medium business or individual EU citizen gets this kind of leniency
and silk gloves treatment. Everything Apple is reaping, it sowed all by
itself. As I posted on Mastodon a few days ago: The EU enacted a new law
a while ago that all bottle caps should remain attached to the bottle,
to combat plastic trash. All the bottle and packaging makers, from
massive multinationals like Coca Cola and fucking Nestlé to small local
producers invested in the development of new caps, changing their
production lines, and shipping the new caps. Today, a month before the
law goes into effect, it’s basically impossible to find a bottle without
an attached cap. I don’t know, I thought this story was weirdly relevant
right now with Apple being a whiny bitch. Imagine being worse than Coca
Cola and motherfucking Nestlé. ↫ Thom Holwerda Apple is in this mess and
facing insane fines as high as 10% of their worldwide turnover because
spoiled, rich, privileged brats like Tim Cook are not used to anyone
ever saying “no”. Silicon Valley has shown, time and time again, from
massive data collection for advertising purposes to scraping the entire
web for machine learning, that they simply do not understand consent.
Now that there’s finally someone big, strong, and powerful enough to not
take Silicon Valley’s bullshit, they start throwing tamper tantrums like
toddlers. Apple’s public attacks on the European Union – and their
instructions to their PR attack dogs to step it up a notch – are not
doing them any favours, either. The EU is, contrary to just about any
other government body in the Western world, ridiculously popular among
its citizens, and laws that curb the power of megacorps are even more
popular. I honestly have no idea who’s running their PR department,
because they’re doing a terrible job, at least here in the EU.</p>

id="decline-of-american-students-in-china-could-mean-fewer-experts">Decline
of American students in China could mean fewer experts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The number of Americans studying in China has dropped
dramatically in recent years from around 11,000 in 2019 to 800 this
year, and the slump is so bad that some China scholars worry the United
States could lose a generation of “China experts” as a result.</p>
<p>David Moser, an American who has lived and worked in China for more
than three decades and is the former academic director of China
Educational Tours (CET) in Beijing, said that “I haven’t seen an
American student in years.”</p>
<p>CET, which was launched in 1982, is a Washington-based organization
that recruits American students for short-term language and culture
studies in China. Moser said that his position as academic director
recently went away and that the organization continues to struggle to
get more students to return to China.</p>
<p>CET once carried out short-term study-abroad programs in several
cities in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Harbin and Hangzhou. Now,
the program is only available in Beijing and Shanghai. Harbin’s page on
the website shows that programs are “suspended until spring 2025.”</p>
<p>“We have already lost a very crucial generation who would need to be
continuing right now in China with studies or whatever,” Moser said, “so
that 10 years from now, they would already be … very experienced China
hands [experts].”</p>
<p>During the 2011-12 school year, the number of American students in
China was around 15,000. Since then, with Xi Jinping’s rise as China’s
leader and growing frictions between the two countries, the number has
declined, dropping dramatically after the pandemic to about 200 at its
lowest point.</p>
<p>Loss of understanding</p>
<p>Moser said the lack of talented people who understand China is
undoubtedly a huge loss for the United States.</p>
<p>“You really need people who understand the two academic systems, the
two college systems, and the way these things work in order to not make
a huge mistake,” he said.</p>
<p>Compared with China, however, CET’s projects in Taiwan are in full
swing.  </p>
<p>Moser said CET started its first summer study abroad program at
National Taiwan University in 2022, which attracted more than 120
American students. He said a program was set up in Taiwan because too
few American students wanted to go to China. </p>
<p>He said he believed that starting around 2008, when Beijing held its
first Olympics, China’s pollution and human rights violations turned
some American students away, and that the trend has not reversed. </p>
<p>China’s strict lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic was also a
crucial turning point. At that time, many foreigners, including American
students, left China. After the Chinese government suddenly lifted the
lockdown at the end of 2022, most foreigners did not immediately
return. </p>
<p>China’s increasingly aggressive posture on the international stage
under Xi, and its hostile propaganda against the West at home, is likely
to have prevented foreign talents from visiting China for cultural and
business exchanges.  </p>
<p>A revised counterespionage law that took effect on July 1, 2023, has
also made many Americans hesitant to travel to China, let alone study
there. </p>
<p>As U.S.-China relations deteriorate, official academic exchanges have
also been coldly received. Former U.S. President Donald Trump suspended
all Fulbright exchange programs to China and Hong Kong in July 2020.
 </p>
<p>After the counterespionage law negatively affected China, the Chinese
government sought to extend goodwill at the level of people-to-people
exchanges. Xi announced during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
meeting in San Francisco in November 2023, “In order to expand exchanges
between the people of China and the United States, especially the
younger generation, China is willing to invite 50,000 American young
people to come to China for exchanges and studies in the next five
years.”</p>
<p>High school students visit </p>
<p>In January 2024, more than 20 students from Muscatine High School in
Iowa visited Beijing, Hebei and Shanghai. In March, 24 students from
Lincoln High School and Steilacoom High School in Washington state also
boarded a plane from San Francisco to Beijing. </p>
<p>Wenzhou University and Kean University in New Jersey signed an
agreement to jointly establish Wenzhou-Kean University in May 2006. At
the time, Xi was the party secretary of Zhejiang, home province of
Wenzhou, and he attended the signing ceremony in 2006.</p>
<p>In a letter to Kean’s president on June 7, Xi encouraged universities
in the two countries to strengthen exchanges and cooperation. However,
three days later,  four American teachers who were giving short-term
courses at Beihua University in Jilin, China, were stabbed by a Chinese
man. Chinese officials quickly deleted the relevant content on social
media, and a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson called the
incident an “accident” that would not affect relations between the two
countries.  </p>
<p>Meghan Burke, a former sociology professor at Illinois Wesleyan
University, said that although the attack on American teachers was a
shocking and unexpected incident, she still hoped that it would not
affect Americans’ confidence in studying and traveling in China. </p>
<p>“I think it’s always been there, but I think with the pandemic, there
was some really racially loaded misinformation and fears that I wouldn’t
be surprised if that came into play in some students’ and some families’
decisions about where they were willing to go abroad,” she said.  </p>
<p>Asked about the 800 American students in China today, Burke said that
was a big regret for the United States.  </p>
<p>“Language is key to understanding culture. So, any limitations on
learning Mandarin or other Chinese languages only hold back our ability
to have a broader and more complex intercultural understanding and
international perspective that I think benefits everyone who is involved
in those conversations,” Burke said. </p>
<p>In contrast, 300,000 Chinese students are studying in the United
States.  </p>
<p>“Asymmetry is bad for China, but it’s much worse for the United
States because asymmetry is in one direction, which is towards us,”
Moser said. “The Chinese have very good knowledge of the U.S., of its
culture, of its government, everything.”</p>

<h2 id="ios-and-ipados-18-can-format-external-drives">iOS and iPadOS 18
can format external drives</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: OS News</p>
<p>I can’t believe this is considered something I need to write about,
but it’s still a very welcome new feature that surprisingly has taken
this long to become available: iOS and iPadOS 18 now allow you to format
external storage devices. Last year when I began testing iPadOS 17
betas, I noticed the addition of options for renaming and erasing
external drives in the Files app. I watched these options over the
course of the beta cycle for iPadOS 17 to see if any further changes
would come. The one I watched most closely was the “Erase” option for
external drives. This option uses the same glyph as the Erase option in
Disc Utility on macOS. In Disc Utility on the Mac, in order to reformat
an external drive, you first select the “Erase” option, and then
additional options appear for selecting the new format you wish to
reformat the drive with. When I saw the “Erase” option added in the
Files app on iPadOS, I suspected that Apple might be moving towards
adding these reformatting options into the Files app on iPadOS. And I’m
excited to confirm that this is exactly what Apple has done in iPadOS
18! ↫ Kaleb Cadle It was soon confirmed this feature is available in iOS
18 as well. You can only format in APFS, ExFAT and FAT, so it’s not
exactly a cornucopia of file systems to choose from, but it’s better
than nothing. This won’t magically fix all the issues a lot of people
have with especially iPadOS when it comes to feeling constrained when
using their expensive, powerful tablets with detachable keyboards, but
it takes away at least one tiny reason to keep a real computer around.
Baby steps, I guess.</p>

<h2 id="why-cooling-centers-were-closed-last-week">Why Cooling Centers
Were Closed Last Week</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
With a brutal heat dome still threatening
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/06/24/heat-forecast-plains-south/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>parts
of the United States</u></a>, one more thing about this summer has
become clear: Cities are struggling to protect their most vulnerable
citizens from extreme temperatures.
</p>
<p>
Just last week, on Juneteenth, over
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/26/us/extreme-heat-risk-tracker-dg/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>82
million</u></a> Americans were under active National Weather Service
extreme heat alerts — but, due to the national holiday, many publicly
operated cooling centers were closed. While Boston had opened 14 new
facilities in partnership with the Centers for Youth and Families, for
instance, none of them stayed
<a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/boston-remains-under-heat-emergency-cooling-centers-closed-due-holiday/4VY53SXGH5GSJESVPTSR77HGCA/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>open</u></a>
Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
The same thing happened in New York, where more than
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/nyc-cooling-centers-closed-for-juneteenth-holiday/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>200</u></a>
cooling centers were closed for the holiday, most of them libraries.
While other heat preparedness measures were still in place — Gov. Kathy
Hochul announced free admission for state parks — residents counting on
a facility near home had to change plans last minute. On Sunday, New
York turned 45 public
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/city-to-open-45-schools-as-cooling-centers-to-replace-closed-libraries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>schools</u></a>
into cooling centers, this time because the public libraries were
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/city-to-open-45-schools-as-cooling-centers-to-replace-closed-libraries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>closed
due to budget cuts</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In Chicago, only one cooling center was open during the holiday. The
lack of cooling spaces available
<a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/06/21/homelessness-advocates-blast-city-for-closing-cooling-centers-libraries-during-juneteenth-heat-wave/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sparked</u></a>
action from homelessness advocates, who are urging the city to offer
more cooling centers that are open 24/7 and also to make those
facilities available when the heat index is above 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
</p>
<p>
Because cooling centers are often multi-purpose spaces, data on their
usage is limited. In Boston, 245 people visited cooling centers from
June 18 to 20, the mayor’s office told me. New York City’s Department of
Emergency Management could only say that six people visited four of the
schools open Sunday.
</p>
<p>
Emergency response services also attended more heat-related calls this
past week. John Chisholm, chief of the Concord Fire Department, told
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/19/weather/heat-wave-news?action=click&pgtype=Article&module=&state=default®ion=footer&context=breakout_link_back_to_briefing#in-chicago-some-brave-the-outdoors-despite-sweltering-temperatures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The
New York Times</em></em></u></a> that the department received more calls
than usual from seniors struggling with the heat on Tuesday. In New
Hampshire, 39 individuals called 911 due to the heat on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday — more than the total amount of calls the service
received in all of June last year.
</p>
<p>
Cooling companies also struggled to meet demands. An HVAC company in
Hartford, Connecticut told
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2024/06/21/heat-wave-weekend-forecast-record-temperatures/74166978007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>USA
Today</em></em></u></a> that it received about 100 calls for service per
day last week — numbers usually only seen during peak summer
temperatures in August. To protect its technicians, the company had to
turn down requests from clients that would have required work in an
attic.
</p>
<p>
Throughout the week, cities
<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91143698/heat-wave-leaves-millions-vulnerable-juneteenth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>canceled</u></a>
activities like food markets, street fairs,
<a href="https://www.woodtv.com/news/kent-county/heat-forces-some-little-leagues-to-cancel-events/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Little
League practices</u></a>, and field trips, were due to the heat.
Instead, people flocked to beaches. In
<a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/crowded-beaches-force-would-be-beachgoers-to-turn-around/3404695/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Massachusetts</u></a>,
the number of people heading to the coast was so high on Wednesday that
some were forced to head back home due to intense traffic and lack of
parking spaces. One exception was New York’s annual
<a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/06/23/2024-coney-island-mermaid-parade/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mermaid
Parade</u></a>, which went on as scheduled.

<h2 id="everyone-wants-nuclear-now">Everyone Wants Nuclear Now</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm has become something of a
one-woman band lately, traveling the country promoting nuclear energy.
In Las Vegas at the American Nuclear Society annual conference last
week, she told the audience, “We’re looking at a chance to build new
nuclear at a scale not seen since the ’70s and ’80s.” A few weeks
earlier she paid a visit to the Vogtle nuclear plant outside of Augusta,
Georgia, site of the first new nuclear project to start construction
this century “It’s time to cash in on our investments by building more,
more of these facilities,” she told an audience there.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the past few decades, when nuclear power plants were more likely
to shut down than be built amidst sluggish growth in electricity demand,
any new nuclear power — whether from a new plant, one that’s producing
new power
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/georgia-nuclear-power-plant-marks-pivot-to-cheaper-retrofits" target="_blank"><u>on
top of its regular output</u></a>, or one
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/04/03/1090603/how-to-reopen-a-nuclear-power-plant/" target="_blank"><u>that’s
re-opening</u></a> — is likely to be bought up eagerly these days by
utilities and big energy buyers with decarbonization mandates. States
and the federal government are more than happy to pony up the dollars to
keep existing nuclear plants running. Technology companies will even pay
a premium for clean power. Amazon, for instance, bought a data center
adjacent to a nuclear plant despite despite having
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/amazon-nuclear-talen-energy" target="_self"><u>no
nuclear strategy to speak of</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
What brought about this abrupt about-face of enthusiasm? In spite of the
rapid expansion of wind and solar and the recent boom in batteries, with
electricity demand rising, it’s hard to turn down any green electrons.
And with all that solar and wind comes a need for “clean firm” power,
sources of electricity that can operate when other sources aren’t. The
Department of Energy estimates that a decarbonized economy will require
700 to 900 gigawatts of clean firm power by 2050, about four times what
is currently on the grid.
</p>
<p>
While a number of power sources fit this bill — long-duration batteries,
geothermal, hydrogen — there is already a massive preexisting nuclear
fleet, and the technology for nuclear power is well-proven, even if
growing costs and decades of environmental opposition arrested the
industry’s growth in the United States for decades.
</p>
<p>
“Demand has changed significantly,” Kenneth Petersen, the outgoing
president of the American Nuclear Society, told me. With tech companies
willing to pay additional for clean, reliable power, “demand is going
up, and you’re getting a premium for that.”
</p>
<p>
While nuclear power has faced stiff opposition from environmental groups
for
decades,<a href="https://blog.ansi.org/2017/01/the-shutdown-of-nuclear-power-plants-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>the crashing price of natural gas in the 2010s</u></a> combined with
the growth and falling cost of renewables made it difficult for some
existing plants to stay in business, especially in regions of the
country with “restructured” energy markets, where the plants were
competing with whatever the cheapest source of power was on the grid.
Despite the fact that these plants were producing large and steady
amounts of carbon-free power, electricity markets at the time didn’t
particularly value either of these attributes.
</p>
<p>
States with aggressive decarbonization goals simply could not reasonably
meet them considering that nuclear plants shutting down tends to result
in more burning of natural gas and more greenhouse gas emissions. The
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided another pot of funding for
existing nuclear, and
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=41534" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>so
in markets</u></a> like New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Illinois, and
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/articles/biden-harris-administration-finalizes-award-11-billion-credits-pacific-gas-and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>California</u></a>,
nuclear plants receive some combination of state and federal dollars to
stay online.
</p>
<p>
Constellation Energy, which has a 21 reactor nuclear fleet,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/constellation-energys-2024-profit-forecast-beats-estimates-tax-credit-benefits-2024-02-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>saw
its stock price shoot up earlier this year</u></a> when it upped its
forecast for revenue growth citing the strong demand and government
support for its clean electrons. Its shares have risen almost 90 percent
on the year.
</p>
<p>
“When you hear utilities talk about restarting a reactor, yep, it’s a
huge effort. And they’re confident that they can sell the offtake of
that,” Petersen told me. In the case of the Palisades nuclear plant in
Michigan, which shut down in 2022 and is now in the process of
re-opening, there is
<a href="https://holtecinternational.com/2023/09/12/holtec-and-wolverine-ink-power-purchase-agreement-for-palisades/" target="_blank">already
<u>a power purchase agreement</u></a> with a group of rural utilities on
the table.
</p>
<p>
Nuclear
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
the third biggest electricity source</u></a> in the U.S. currently, and
the largest non-carbon emitting one. As Secretary Granholm likes to
remind the public — and the industry — nuclear power hasn’t had more
explicit support than it has now in decades. That has come in the form
of tax credits for energy output, an overhauled
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>regulatory
process for advanced reactors</u></a>, and explicit funding for
early-stage projects.
</p>
<p>
But Granholm isn’t the only public official talking to anyone who will
listen about America’s nuclear industry.
</p>
<p>
Tim Echols, the vice chairman of Georgia Public Service Commission, the
regulator that oversaw Southern Company’s Vogtle project, has been
warning other state regulators about embarking on a new nuclear project
without explicit cost protection from the federal government. The third
and fourth Vogtle reactors started construction in 2013,
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61963" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about
a decade after the planning process began</a>; the final reactor was
completed and started putting power on the grid in April, some $35
billion later
(<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61963" target="_blank"><u>the
project was originally expected to cost $14 billion</u></a>).
</p>
<p>
And that was a successful project. A similar project in South Carolina
was never completed and took down the utility, SCANA that planned it,
even resulting in
<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sc/pr/former-scana-ceo-sentenced-two-years-defrauding-ratepayers-connection-failed-nuclear" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
two-year federal prison sentence for its chief executive</u></a>, who
was convicted of having “intentionally defrauded ratepayers while
overseeing and managing SCANA’s operations — including the construction
of two reactors at the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station.” Westinghouse, which
designed the reactor in operation at Vogtle, known as the AP1000, itself
went bankrupt in 2016.
</p>
<p>
Echols is proud of Vogtle now. “Finishing those AP1000s at Vogtle
changed everything,” Echols told me in an email. “People are looking
past the overruns and celebrating this as a great accomplishment.”
</p>
<p>
But he’s pretty sure no one else should do it like Georgia did, with
<a href="https://georgiarecorder.com/2023/12/19/state-regulators-pass-along-7-6b-tab-to-ratepayers-for-georgia-powers-plant-vogtle/" target="_blank"><u>a
utility using ratepayer funds</u></a> for a nuclear project of uncertain
cost and duration. “So many of my colleague regulators in other states
don’t feel there are enough financial protections in place yet — and
that is holding them back,” Echols told me. “The very real possibility
of bankruptcy exists on any of these nuclear projects, and I am not
comfortable moving forward with some catastrophic protection — and only
the federal government can provide that.”
</p>
<p>
Granholm and other DOE officials
including<a href="https://www.volts.wtf/p/nuclear-perhaps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>Jigar Shah</u></a>, head of the Loan Programs Office, have expressed
puzzlement at this view. At the ANS conference, Granholm
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-21/america-s-nuclear-push-doesn-t-guarantee-a-revival" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointed
to</u></a> “billions and billions and billions” that the federal
government is offering in terms of loan guarantees (from
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/how-loan-programs-office-and-plant-vogtle-are-shaping-energy-transition-through" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>which
Vogtle benefitted </u></a>under presidents Obama and
Trump)<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/remarks-delivered-secretary-jennifer-m-granholm-startup-vogtle-unit-4-and-growth-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
</a>and
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/remarks-delivered-secretary-jennifer-m-granholm-startup-vogtle-unit-4-and-growth-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>investment
tax credits</u></a> that, according to the Breakthrough Institute’s Adam
Stein, could amount to “around 60% cost overrun protection” when
combined with DOE loans.
</p>
<p>
It’s unlikely that Republicans would be more interested in this level of
cost protection than Democrats. Shelly Moore Capito, the West Virginia
Republican who helped shepherd a recent nuclear regulatory reform bill
through
Congress,<a href="https://x.com/SiegelScribe/status/1804153244765011972/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
<u>told </u><u><em><em>Politico</em></em></u></a>, “I don’t think the
government should be in the business of giving backstop.”
</p>
<p>
Echols conceded that Shah “is right in saying the deal is better than it
was when we started our AP1000s,” but still said the possibility of
bankruptcy was too daunting for state utility regulators.
</p>
<p>
While technology companies that want to buy clean electrons have
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-17/big-tech-wants-nuclear-power-but-doesn-t-see-role-as-investor#:~:text=Big%20technology%20companies%20including%20Microsoft,a%20growing%20interest%20in%20reactors." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>demurred
about actually financing</u></a> construction of next generation
“advanced” nuclear plants, Echols predicted that “companies like Dow,
Microsoft, or Google build a [small modular reactor] before any utility
in America can finish another AP1000,” referring to the reactor model at
Vogtle, which is about one gigawatt per reactor, compared to the few
hundred megawatts contemplated by designs for small modular reactors.
</p>
<p>
Dow is currently working on
<a href="https://corporate.dow.com/en-us/news/press-releases/dow-x-energy-collaborate-on-smr-nuclear.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
gas-cooled reactor project with X-energy</u></a> that would provide both
power and industrial steam. The reactor would operate at a higher
temperature than the light water reactors that dominate the U.S. nuclear
fleet. TerraPower, the Bill Gates backed startup — that has received
<a href="https://energycommunities.gov/terrapower-nuclear-plant-wyoming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions
of dollars in federal support</u></a>, started construction on the
non-nuclear portion of its Natrium plant in Wyoming earlier this year,
while a number of other advanced reactor projects are at various stages
of design and preparation. There’s only one design that’s received
certification from the NRC, however, and the company behind it, NuScale,
saw its one active project to build a plant
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=robinson+mayer+nuscale&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS940US940&oq=robinson+mayer+nuscale&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDMzNTBqMWo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank"><u>collapse
due to rising costs</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
As Breakthrough’s Stein told me, “It’s not really going to be a question
of large LWR vs. SMR or water-based SMR vs advanced. We’re going to need
a mix of technology to get to net zero, just like we need a mix of
nuclear and non-nuclear. “The nuclear space is not nearly as homogenous
as photovoltaic space — it’s not all one technology with different
advantages that can fit different niches.”
</p>
<p>
Much of the Department of Energy’s work in past years has been in
funding and supporting the development of these “advanced” reactors,
which are supposed to be more efficient and safer than existing
light-water reactor designs and can serve more discrete purposes,
including industrial processes like steam. Last week, Granholm announced
almost $1 billion of money from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for
the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-900-million-accelerate-deployment-next-generation-light-water-small-modular" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construction
of small modular reactors</u></a>. The ADVANCE Act, which passed the
Senate last week, was designed to help make reviews of these reactor
designs faster, cheaper and more focused.
</p>
<p>
“I think the Vogtle experience and what that means for ratepayers makes
it very, very unlikely that another utility is going to step up and
ratebase a big first-of-its-kind, firm, flexible generation technology,”
Jeff Navin, a former Department of Energy official and partner at the
public affairs firm representing TerraPower, told me. “The challenges
facing financing nuclear are the same challenges that you’re going to
face with carbon capture, with large-scale hydrogen production, with
enhanced geothermal, with all of these others technologies that we all
know we need to have to solve climate change. But we don’t really know
how to finance these things.”
</p>
<p>
Many analysts think that <em><em>if</em></em> we get advanced reactors,
it will likely be sometime in the early 2030s. “Optimistically, maybe
2032 we should have a couple of these things up and running,” Jacopo
Buongiorno, a nuclear engineering professor at MIT, told me. “All the
industry needs is one winner, and the floodgates might open.”

Slack will be reducing its data storage needs and trying to incentivize
free teams to upgrade by deleting data older than a year from free
workspaces. Only the last 90 days of data is visible anyway; the change
affects only those who upgrade to a paid plan and would previously have
recovered all old data.

“The best commerce platforms will be constantly grooming you, priming
you, shaping you to buy. The combination of short-term and long-term
value that leads to the optimal financial outcome for the business.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think this is inevitably correct: the web will devolve into a battle
between different entities who are all trying to persuade you to take
different actions. That’s already been true for decades, but it’s been
ambient until now; generative AI gives it the ability to literally argue
with us. Which means we’re going to need our own bots to argue back.
</p>
<p>
Hunter’s analogy of a bot that’s supposedly in your corner calling
bullshit on all the bots trying to sell things to you is a good one.
Except, who will build the bot that’s in your corner? Why will it
definitely be so? Who will profit from it?
</p>
<p>
What a spiral this will be.

<blockquote>
<p>
“Many genuinely good arguments for moral change will be initially
experienced as <em>annoying</em>. Moreover, the emotional responses that
people feel in these situations are not typically produced by
psychological processes that are closely tracking argument structure or
responding directly to moral reasons.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a useful breakdown of why arguments for social progress
encounter so much friction, and why the first emotional response may be
to roll our eyes. It’s all about our norm psychologies - and some people
have stronger reactions than others.
</p>
<p>
As the authors make clear here, people who are already outside of the
mainstream culture for one reason or another (immigration, belonging to
a minority or vulnerable group, and so on) already feel friction from
the prevailing norms being misaligned with their own psychology. If that
isn’t the case, change is that much harder.
</p>
<p>
But naming it is at least part of the battle:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Knowing this fact about yourself should lead you to pause the next time
you reflexively roll your eyes upon encountering some new, annoying norm
and the changes its advocates are asking you to make. That irritation is
not your bullshit detector going off.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Talking about these effects, and understanding their origins, helps
everyone better understand their reactions and get to better outcomes.
Social change is both necessary and likely to happen regardless of our
reactions. It’s always better to be a person who celebrates progressive
change rather than someone who creates friction in the face of it.

Kate Brigham reported</a>, once the two facilities reach full scale,
they will have the capacity to suck up a combined 317,000 metric tons of

Swiss DAC company Climeworks, and project developer Battelle. As per the
initial plan, Climeworks will still build out its portion of Project
Cypress in southwest Louisiana, and together with Heirloom’s Shreveport
plant, the two facilities will pull a combined megaton of CO2 out of the
atmosphere every year. Heirloom expects its new 17,000 ton facility to
be operational by 2026, while its larger Project Cypress plant is
planned to come online in 2027. Initially, this larger facility will
remove 100,000 metric tons of CO2 annually, eventually ramping up to
300,000 metric tons. For both projects, Heirloom is partnering with the
carbon management company CapturePoint to permanently sequester CO2 in
underground wells.

published in the journal <em>Nature Climate Change</em> found that
geoengineering projects off the West Coast of the U.S. could
inadvertently lead to more intense heat waves over Europe. The paper
examines “marine cloud brightening,” which would involve spraying
aerosol particles into the atmosphere to reflect solar radiation. The
researchers concluded that this process would indeed lower temperatures
in Western states, but only temporarily. By 2050, if temperatures
increase by 2 degrees Celsius, the researchers’ models suggest cloud
brightening would be ineffective and would actually lead to temperature
increases in Europe.

<h2 id="heirloom-is-moving-a-giant-dac-project-to-shreveport">Heirloom
Is Moving a Giant DAC Project to Shreveport</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ4NTU5NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzkxMjk0NX0.mWKv8PW6cf_q8qdXepcxRwB7NDsq3ErSdiN93IIQYzI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Northwest Louisiana is about to be awash in direct air capture. Heirloom
announced today that it’s moving its half of the Department of
Energy-funded
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self"><u>Project
Cypress</u></a> DAC hub from coastal Calcasieu Parish inland to
Shreveport — and that it will be building a second facility, capable of
removing 17,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, on the same
site. Once the two facilities reach full scale, they will have the
capacity to suck up a combined 317,000 metric tons of CO2 per year.
</p>
<p>
Project Cypress, one of two regional DAC hubs that’s been announced thus
far, is a partnership between Bay Area-based Heirloom, the Swiss DAC
company Climeworks, and project developer Battelle. As per the initial
plan, Climeworks will still build out its portion of Project Cypress in
southwest Louisiana, and together with Heirloom’s Shreveport plant, the
two facilities will pull a combined megaton of CO2 out of the atmosphere
every year.
</p>
<p>
Those are the basic facts, but still, I had a lot of questions. Why make
the move at all? What does it mean for Project Cypress, for the
Calcasieu community, and for Climeworks? Here’s what Heirloom told me.
</p>
<h3>
Why Shreveport?
</h3>
<p>
Heirloom was already in the planning phase for its 17,000 ton facility
in Shreveport prior to its selection for the DAC hubs program, a
spokesperson told me. Thus, “it became clear that co-locating our
portion of the Project Cypress Hub in the same location made a lot of
sense from a cost and operational efficiency perspective.”
</p>
<h3>
Will this make Project Cypress more expensive?
</h3>
<p>
At this early stage it’s hard to say. But Heirloom and Climeworks will
now need to develop their own distinct CO2 transport and storage
systems, infrastructure that could have been shared were the two
facilities close together.
</p>
<p>
Heirloom, for its part, expects its new 17,000 ton facility to be
operational by 2026, while its larger Project Cypress plant is planned
to come online in 2027. Initially, this larger facility will remove
100,000 metric tons of CO2 annually, eventually ramping up to 300,000
metric tons. For both projects, Heirloom is partnering with the carbon
management company CapturePoint to permanently sequester CO2 in
underground wells.
</p>
<p>
But storing carbon is not the only logistical challenge involved. The
companies will now need to undertake separate community planning and
engagement processes, a daunting task even when they had just one to
figure out. And yet, the Heirloom spokesperson told us, because planning
for Project Cypress is still in its early stages, any additional impacts
will be “minimal.”
</p>
<h3>
Did the Department of Energy approve the change?
</h3>
<p>
The DOE administers the DAC Hub program that awarded Project Cypress
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self"><u>$50
million</u></a> in March, so this is no small question. The program is
“meant to spur the development of clean energy capabilities across
geographical regions, not necessarily in one specific location,” the
Heirloom spokesperson told me, and said “the Department of Energy has
been incredibly supportive of Heirloom’s expansion into North West
Louisiana.” (When we asked DOE, a representative said the agency knew of
the move but didn’t provide any further details.)
</p>
<p>
All this comes on the heels of a big year for Heirloom, which uses
limestone powder to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Late last year it
unveiled its first commercial DAC facility, which is capable of
capturing 1,000 metric tons annually. The Shreveport plants thus
represent a massive scale-up.
</p>
<p>
Heirloom wouldn’t disclose its cost per metric ton of CO2 removed, but
the spokesperson said it’s currently “in the high hundreds of dollars,”
and that it has an eye toward getting below $100 per metric ton by 2035,
the widely accepted metric for commercial viability. So far, the company
said, it has “sold a substantial portion of the capacity from both
facilities to voluntary buyers.” Customers include major players in the
voluntary carbon removal market, including Microsoft, Stripe, Klarna,
JPMorgan Chase and Meta. Louisiana is also providing Heirloom with a set
of economic incentives worth around $10 million, the company said.

<p>
The deadline for students and parents to get their federal financial aid
form into colleges and universities is this Sunday. With all that data
you input on income and savings, there’s still something big missing:
overall household wealth. Some education policy researchers say the
financial aid system should be taking a closer look at big assets, like
homes. Also: Federal prosecutors are recommending criminal charges
against Boeing, and visas for nurses are running out again.

survey: Women in US have just 1/3 of men’s retirement savings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Women in the U.S. have saved just a third of the amount
that men have set aside for retirement, setting up a potential crisis
among female retirees, according to a Prudential Financial survey
released on Monday.  </p>
<p>On average, men had saved $157,000 for retirement, while women had
only put aside $50,000 according to a survey of 905 U.S. adults between
the ages of 55 and 75.  </p>
<p>“The financial futures of certain cohorts – such as women – are
especially precarious,” Caroline Feeney, CEO of Prudential’s U.S.
Businesses, said in a statement. “Women have a more challenging time
saving for retirement,” she added, citing inflation, housing prices and
changes in tax policies as the main barriers.  </p>
<p>Compared with the men surveyed, women were three times more likely to
be focused on providing for their families and children than saving.
 </p>
<p>Of the respondents, 46% of men said they were looking forward to
retirement and had more plans, compared with 27% of women polled, the
survey showed.</p>

id="abortion-rights-interests-plow-money-into-us-election-races-after-supreme-court-reversal">Abortion
rights interests plow money into US election races after Supreme Court
reversal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — In the two years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned
women’s constitutional right to abortion, political contributions aimed
at protecting abortion rights have far outstripped those to support
anti-abortion causes.</p>
<p>In the 2023-2024 election cycle leading up to the Nov. 5 vote,
pro-abortion rights interests have given $3.37 million to federal
candidates, political parties, political action committees (PACs) and
outside groups, compared to about $273,000 from anti-abortion interests,
according to data from OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics.</p>
<p>The level of spending by pro-abortion rights interests is expected to
offer a financial boost to the campaigns of some Democratic candidates
including U.S. President Joe Biden, who has made protecting abortion
rights a central part of his campaign message for reelection.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, in 2022
overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent that had legalized abortion
nationwide, prompting 14 states to since enact measures banning or
sharply restricting the procedure.</p>
<p>Groups like super PACs received 65.8% of contributions from those
backing abortion rights in this election cycle, according to a Reuters
analysis of OpenSecrets data.</p>
<p>Republican candidates and party committees got the bulk — about 75.9%
— of contributions from anti-abortion rights interests.</p>
<p>PACs are typically set up to gather funds for candidates or political
causes. They differ from outside money groups like super PACs, which can
receive donations of unlimited size but cannot coordinate with campaigns
directly.</p>
<p>So far this election cycle, PACs and super PACs allied with
anti-abortion causes have raised $3.54 million, while abortion rights
groups have raised $15.3 million, OpenSecrets data showed.</p>
<p>“The balance of spending between pro-abortion rights and
anti-abortion rights groups always reflected the fact that there are
more people who support abortion rights than who don’t,” said Mary
Ziegler, a law professor at University of California, Davis.</p>
<p>Ziegler said she would not be surprised if political donations to
support or oppose abortion rights rose for the 2024 election cycle
compared to the 2020 election cycle.</p>
<p>2020 election cycle set records</p>
<p>The sums reported so far are dwarfed by those in the 2020 election
cycle, in which abortion rights interests poured in $11.33 million in
political contributions, with spending in the 2022 midterm election
cycle coming in second with $10.67 million in contributions, OpenSecrets
data showed.</p>
<p>Contributions from anti-abortion interests totaled $6.41 million in
the 2020 cycle, and $2.7 million in the 2022 midterm cycle, during which
the outcomes for ballot measures and competitive races seemed to suggest
that voters were eager to protect abortion access at the state
level.</p>
<p>With more than four months to go before the November election, it
remains to be seen whether contributions this election cycle from
abortion rights and anti-abortion causes will outstrip those in the 2020
cycle, when Biden beat the incumbent Donald Trump, a Republican.</p>
<p>The impact of political contributions on race outcomes is
complicated, Ziegler said, as voters have various priorities at the
ballot box.</p>
<p>“You can’t dismiss the importance of it, but it’s not like [more
contributions] definitely means ballot initiatives are going to pass,
Democrats are going to win, etc. It’s not that simple,” Ziegler
said.</p>
<p>During Trump’s term as president, which started in 2017, he appointed
a third of the current members of the Supreme Court and half of its
conservative bloc, with all three of his picks coming from a list
compiled by conservative legal activists.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign earlier this month said he supports the rights of
states to make decisions on abortion, supports exceptions for abortions
in cases of rape, incest and life of the mother, and also supports
protecting access to contraception and in vitro fertilization.</p>
<p>Two of the top contributors to candidates and groups are Planned
Parenthood - which advocates for abortion rights — and Susan B. Anthony
Pro-Life America — which lobbies against abortion rights.</p>
<p>So far this election cycle, Planned Parenthood has contributed $2.53
million, most of that to liberal groups, the Democratic party and its
candidates.</p>
<p>Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America has contributed about $92,600,
almost all of it to Republican candidates and their party.</p>

protesters run onto green, spray powder, delaying finish of PGA Tour
event</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CROMWELL, Conn. — Six climate protesters stormed the 18th green while
the leaders were lining up their putts for the final hole of regulation
at the PGA Tour’s Travelers Championship on Sunday, spraying smoke and
powder and delaying the finish for about five minutes.</p>
<p>The protesters waved smoke bombs that left white and red residue on
the putting surface before Scottie Scheffler, Tom Kim and Akshay Bhatia
finished their rounds. Some wore white T-shirts with the words “NO GOLF
ON A DEAD PLANET” in black lettering on the front.</p>
<p>“I was scared for my life,” Bhatia said. “I didn’t even really know
what was happening. … But thankfully the cops were there and kept us
safe, because that’s, you know, that’s just weird stuff.”</p>
<p>The PGA Tour issued a statement thanking the Cromwell Police
Department “for their quick and decisive action” and noting that there
was no damage to the 18th green that affected either the end of
regulation or the playoff hole.</p>
<p>Scheffler, who recently was arrested during a traffic stop at the PGA
Championship, also praised the officers.</p>
<p>“From my point of view, they got it taken care of pretty dang fast,
and so we were very grateful for that,” said Scheffler, the world’s
No. 1 player, who beat Kim on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff
for his sixth victory of the year.</p>
<p>“When something like that happens, you don’t really know what’s
happening, so it can kind of rattle you a little bit,” Scheffler said.
“That can be a stressful situation, and you would hate for the
tournament to end on something weird happening because of a situation
like that. I felt like Tom and I both tried to calm each other down so
we could give it our best shot there on 18.”</p>
<p>Extinction Rebellion, an activist group with a history of disrupting
events around the world, claimed responsibility for the protest. In a
statement emailed to The Associated Press, the group blamed climate
change for an electrical storm that injured two people at a home near
the course on Saturday.</p>
<p>“This was of course due to increasingly unpredictable and extreme
weather conditions,” the statement said. “Golf, more than other events,
is heavily reliant on good weather. Golf fans should therefore
understand better than most the need for strong, immediate climate
action.”</p>
<p>After the protesters were tackled by police and taken off, Scheffler
left a potential 26-foot clincher from the fringe on the right edge of
the cup, then tapped in for par. Kim, who trailed by one stroke heading
into the final hole, sank a 10-foot birdie putt to tie Scheffler and
force the playoff.</p>

<h2 id="new-zealand-wins-mubadala-new-york-sail-grand-prix">New Zealand
wins Mubadala New York Sail Grand Prix</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-24, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New Zealand came out victorious in the Mubadala New York
Sail Grand Prix, the “world’s most exciting racing on water,” on New
York’s Hudson River Sunday.</p>
<p>The two-day event was the penultimate race weekend of Mubadala SailGP
before the competition’s fourth season concludes in San Francisco in
July.</p>
<p>SailGP is an international sailing competition in which F50 foiling
catamarans compete at 13 global destinations for a season of grand prix
races. Some of this season’s previous destinations included Dubai,
United Arab Emirates, and Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>Each grand prix consists of separate “fleet races” before the three
highest-scoring teams compete in a final race to decide the
champion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This SailGP season consists of 10 world-renowned teams: Australia,
Canada, Emirates Great Britain, France, Germany, New Zealand, Rockwool
Denmark, Spain, Switzerland and the United States.</p>
<p>On Friday, Coutts announced that SailGP Season Five would feature a
Brazil team, the competition’s first-ever team from South America.</p>
<p>“As a league, it’s an awesome place to be,” said Phil Robertson,
Canada’s driver. “You got new teams and a lot of interest from a lot of
countries so to have Brazil on the start line is very special and cool
to expand to South America.”</p>
<p>Coming off its last race in Halifax, Canada, earlier this month,
SailGP completed its 12th stop around the world this season in the
waters between New York and New Jersey in which Canada placed second and
Emirates Great Britain placed third.</p>
<p>The last time SailGP raced in New York was its debut season in
2019.</p>
<p>“Looking back on that inaugural event is like reflecting on a totally
different stage in our journey,” Russell Coutts, CEO of SailGP, said in
a press conference Friday. “We had just six national teams in a
five-event calendar and now nearing the end of Season Four, we have 10
teams with the best of the best athletes in the sport, competing in a
13-event calendar, broadcast in 212 territories around the world.”</p>
<p>Approximately 9,000 ticketed attendees gathered on Governors Island
and on the water Saturday and Sunday to watch the races.</p>
<p>Taylor Canfield, driver for the U.S. team, spoke on the significance
of sailing in front of home fans in New York City and in San Francisco
next month.</p>
<p>“It’s so cool to be here in the U.S. and these two iconic cities in
New York and San Francisco,” Canfield said in Friday’s press conference.
“It’s going to be amazing conditions and just perfect weather. This is
the most iconic city in the world and it’s going to come alive so we’re
excited about that.”</p>
<p>Looking forward to the final races in San Francisco next month, team
Australia — reigning champion of SailGP seasons one, two and three —
faces pressure to take home another win.</p>
<p>“It’s exciting to be in this position,” Tom Slingsby, driver for
Australia, said. “For sure there’s a bit more adrenaline and there’s a
bit more on the line knowing that every race really counts at the moment
but I have full faith in my team. We’ve performed under pressure, we’ve
won three one million dollar races.”</p>
<p>On July 14, one team will walk away with a $2 million prize and the
title of SailGP’s season four champion.</p>

North Korea defense deal may create friction with China, US top general
says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Espargos, Cape Verde — Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mutual
defense agreement with North Korea has the potential to create friction
with China, which has long been the reclusive state’s main ally, the top
U.S. military officer said Sunday.</p>
<p>“We’ve got someone else who’s kind of nudging in now, so that may
drive a little bit more friction between (China) and Russia,” Air Force
General Charles Q. Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told
reporters during an overseas trip.</p>
<p>“So, it’ll be interesting to see how these three countries — how this
plays out.”</p>
<p>Analysts said the pact, signed Wednesday, could undercut Beijing’s
leverage over its two neighbors and any heightened instability could be
negative for China’s global economic and strategic ambitions.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Putin said Russia might supply weapons to North Korea in
what he suggested would be a mirror response to the Western arming of
Ukraine.</p>
<p>Brown acknowledged U.S. concern about the deal.</p>
<p>But he also tempered those remarks by noting apparent limitations to
the accord and expressing doubt Moscow would give North Korea
“everything” it wanted.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said they believe North Korea is keen to acquire
fighter aircraft, surface-to-air missiles, armored vehicles, ballistic
missile production equipment or materials, and other advanced
technologies from Russia.</p>
<p>“The feedback I have on the agreement — it was a broad agreement
that’s not overly binding, which gives you an indication (that) they
want to work together but they don’t want to get their hands tied,”
Brown said.</p>
<p>The treaty signed by Putin and Kim on Wednesday commits each side to
provide immediate military assistance to the other in the event of armed
aggression against either one of them.</p>
<p>Putin has said Moscow expected that its cooperation with North Korea
would serve as a deterrent to the West, but that there was no need to
use North Korean soldiers for the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The United States and Ukraine say North Korea has already provided
Russia with significant quantities of artillery shells and ballistic
missiles, which Moscow and Pyongyang deny.</p>

prosecutors recommend Justice Department criminally charge Boeing as
deadline looms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. prosecutors are recommending to senior Justice
Department officials that criminal charges be brought against Boeing
after finding the planemaker violated a settlement related to two fatal
crashes, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Justice Department (DOJ) must decide by July 7 whether to
prosecute Boeing. The recommendation of prosecutors handling the case
has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>In May, officials determined the company breached a 2021 agreement
that had shielded Boeing from a criminal charge of conspiracy to commit
fraud arising from two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving the 737
MAX jet.</p>
<p>Under the 2021 deal, the Justice Department agreed not to prosecute
Boeing over allegations it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration
so long as the company overhauled its compliance practices and submitted
regular reports. Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle the
investigation.</p>
<p>Boeing declined to comment. It has previously said it has “honored
the terms” of the 2021 settlement, which had a three-year term and is
known as a deferred prosecution agreement. Boeing has told the Justice
Department it disagrees with its determination that the company violated
the settlement, Reuters reported this month.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment.</p>
<p>The two sides are in discussions over a potential resolution to the
Justice Department’s investigation and there is no guarantee officials
will move forward with charges, the two sources said. The internal
Justice Department deliberations remain ongoing, and no final decisions
have been reached, they added.</p>
<p>Criminal charges would deepen an unfolding crisis at Boeing, which
has faced intense scrutiny from U.S. prosecutors, regulators and
lawmakers after a panel blew off one of its jets operated by Alaska
Airlines mid-flight Jan. 5, just two days before the 2021 settlement
expired.</p>
<p>The sources did not specify what criminal charges Justice Department
officials are considering, but one of the people said they could extend
beyond the original 2021 fraud conspiracy charge.</p>
<p>Alternatively, instead of prosecuting Boeing, the DOJ could extend
the 2021 settlement by a year or propose new, stricter terms, the
sources said.</p>
<p>In addition to financial penalties, the strictest settlements
typically involve installing a third party to monitor a company’s
compliance. The DOJ can also require the company to admit its wrongdoing
by pleading guilty.</p>
<p>Boeing may be willing to pay a penalty and agree to a monitor, but
believes a guilty plea, which typically incurs additional business
restrictions, could be too damaging, said one of the sources. Boeing
derives significant revenue from contracts with the U.S. government,
including the Defense Department, which could be jeopardized by a felony
conviction, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>Relatives of the victims of the two fatal 737 MAX crashes have long
criticized the 2021 agreement, arguing that Justice Department officials
should have prosecuted the company and its executives.</p>
<p>At a Senate hearing in June, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun
acknowledged the company’s shortcomings on safety and apologized to the
families who lost loved ones.</p>
<p>Last week, the families pressed prosecutors to seek a fine against
the planemaker of nearly $25 billion and move forward with a criminal
prosecution.</p>

<h2 id="mozilla-acquires-ad-analytics-company-for-some-reason">Mozilla
acquires ad analytics company, for some reason</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of my biggest concerns regarding the state of the web isn’t ads
(easily blocked) or machine learning (the legal system isn’t going to be
kind to that), but the possible demise of Firefox. I’ve long been
worried that with the seemingly never-ending downward marketshare spiral
Firefox is in – it’s at like 3% now on desktop, even less on mobile –
Mozilla’s pretty much sole source of income will eventually pull the
plug, leaving the already struggling browser effectively for dead. I’ve
continuously been warning that the first casualty of the downward spiral
would be Firefox on platforms other than Windows and macOS. So, what do
we make of Mozilla buying an online advertising analytics company?
Mozilla has acquired Anonym, a trailblazer in privacy-preserving digital
advertising. This strategic acquisition enables Mozilla to help raise
the bar for the advertising industry by ensuring user privacy while
delivering effective advertising solutions. ↫ Laura Chambers They way
Mozilla explains buying an advertising network is that the company wants
to be a trailblazer privacy-conscious online advertising, since the
current brand of online advertising, which relies on massive amounts of
data collection, is unsustainable. Anonym instead employs a number of
measures to ensure that privacy is guaranteed, from anonymous analytics
to employing differential privacy when it comes to algorithms, ensuring
data can’t be used to tack individual users. I have no reason to doubt
Mozilla’s intentions here – at least for now – but intentions change,
people in charge change, and circumstances change. Having an ad network
integrated into the Mozilla organisation will surely lead to temptations
of weakening Firefox’ privacy features and ad-blocking abilities, and
just overall I find it an odd acquisition target for something like
Mozilla, and antithetical to why most people use Firefox in the first
place. What really doesn’t help is who originally founded Anonym – two
former Facebook executives, backed by a load of venture capital. Do with
that little tidbit of information as you please.</p>

in US for knee treatment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Tibet’s spiritual leader the Dalai Lama arrived Sunday in
New York to undergo knee treatment, drawing a warm and festive welcome
from thousands of followers.</p>
<p>His office in the Indian hill town of Dharamsala, his adopted home,
announced earlier this month that the 88-year-old Buddhist spiritual
leader would travel to the United States to undergo “medical treatment”
on his knees, but no further details have been released.  </p>
<p>Followers, many wearing traditional Tibetan outfits, waited outside
the Dalai Lama’s Manhattan hotel in crushing heat hoping to catch a
glimpse of the man.</p>
<p>“Once we saw him, it felt really powerful. And everyone was, like,
emotional because he’s, like, our leader,” said one of them, 18-year-old
U.S.-born Tenzin Pasang, who has now seen the Dalai Lama three
times.</p>
<p>“So it’s very nice to see him in New York,” she said.</p>
<p>She welcomed the spiritual leader by joining in a performance of a
traditional Tibetan dance.</p>
<p>Last week a group of senior U.S. lawmakers including former House
speaker Nancy Pelosi met with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan
government-in-exile in Dharamsala, sparking heavy criticism from
China.</p>
<p>That visit followed passage of a bill by the U.S. Congress that seeks
to encourage Beijing to hold talks with Tibetan leaders – frozen since
2010.</p>
<p>Many exiled Tibetans fear Beijing will name a rival successor to the
Dalai Lama, bolstering control over a land it poured troops into in
1950.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama was just 23 when he escaped the Tibetan capital Lhasa
in fear of his life after Chinese soldiers eviscerated an uprising
against Beijing’s forces, crossing the snowy Himalayas into India.</p>
<p>He stepped down as his people’s political head in 2011, passing the
baton of secular power to a government chosen democratically by some
130,000 Tibetans around the world.</p>

iconic ‘Bean’ sculpture reopens to tourists after nearly a year of
construction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chicago — One of Chicago’s most popular tourist attractions known as
“The Bean” reopened to the public Sunday after nearly a year of
renovations and construction.</p>
<p>Construction started in August last year, and fencing around the
iconic sculpture limited closeup access to visitors. The work on the
plaza surrounding the sculpture included new stairs, accessible ramps
and a waterproofing system, according to the Chicago Department of
Cultural Affairs and Special Events.</p>
<p>The bean-shaped sculpture by artist Anish Kapoor is formally known as
“Cloud Gate” and weighs 110 tons (99.8 metric tons).</p>
<p>It’s a busy tourist hub near Michigan Avenue, particularly for
selfies with its reflective surface inspired by liquid mercury. Views of
skyscrapers and crowds are reflected on the Millennium Park
sculpture.</p>
<p>“Visitors can once again have full access to Chicago’s iconic Cloud
Gate by Anish Kapoor,” city officials said in a Sunday statement. “Come
back and get your #selfie!”</p>

id="inside-out-2-scores-100m-in-its-2nd-weekend-setting-records">‘Inside
Out 2’ scores $100M in its 2nd weekend, setting records</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Weekend number two was just as joyous for “Inside Out
2.” </p>
<p>The Pixar sequel collected $100 million in ticket sales in its second
weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, setting a record for an
animated movie in its follow-up frame in theaters. The previous best
second weekend for an animated title was the $92 million for “The Super
Mario Bros. Movie.” Only six movies ever have had better second
weekends.</p>
<p>In just a week and a half, “Inside Out 2” has become 2024’s
highest-grossing film to date with $724.4 million globally, including
$355.2 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters. That passes the $711.8
million worldwide total of “Dune: Part Two.” “Inside Out 2” will likely
blow through the $1 billion mark in about a week, which would make it
the first film since “Barbie” to do so.</p>
<p>The extent of the “Inside Out 2” success startled Hollywood, which
had grown accustomed to lower expectations as the film industry watched
ticket sales this year slump about 40% below pre-pandemic totals,
according to data firm Comscore, before “Inside Out 2” came along.</p>
<p>The record haul for “Inside Out 2,” though, recalled past years when
$1 billion grosses were more commonplace for the Walt Disney Co. It is
also a much-needed blockbuster for Pixar, which after experimenting with
direct-to-streaming releases, reconsidered its movie pipeline and
approach to mass-audience appeal.</p>
<p>Now, “Inside Out 2,” which dipped a mere 35% from its $154 million
domestic debut, is poised to challenge “The Incredibles 2” ($1.2
billion) for the all-time top grossing Pixar release. It could also
steer the venerated animation factory toward more sequels. Among its
upcoming films is “Toy Story 5,” due out in 2026.</p>
<p>For theater owners, “Inside Out 2” could hardly have been more
needed. But it also reminded exhibitors of how feast-or-famine the movie
business has become in recent years. Since the pandemic, movies like
“Barbie,” “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and “Top Gun: Maverick” have pushed
ticket sales to record heights, but fallow periods in between box-office
sensations have grown longer. Ticket sales over Memorial Day last month
were the worst in three decades.</p>
<p>Some of 2024’s downturn can be attributed to release-schedule
juggling caused by last year’s writers and actors strikes. The biggest
new release over the weekend was Jeff Nichols’ motorcycle gang drama
“The Bikeriders,” a film originally slated to open in 2023 before the
actors’ strike prompted its postponement.</p>
<p>“The Bikeriders,” starring Jodie Comer, Austin Butler and Tom Hardy,
came in on the high side of expectations with $10 million from 2,642
venues in its opening weekend. “The Bikeriders,” which cost about $35
million to produce, was originally to be released by Disney before New
Regency took it to Focus Features last fall.</p>
<p>The strong business for “Inside Out 2” appeared to raise ticket sales
generally. Sony Pictures’ “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” held well in its third
week of release, collecting $18.8 million. It remained in second place.
The “Bad Boys” sequel, starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, has
grossed $146.9 million domestically thus far.</p>
<p>Next week, the sci-fi horror prequel “A Quiet Place: Day One” and
Kevin Costner’s Western epic “Horizon: An American Saga - Chapter 1”
will hope some of the “Inside Out 2” success rubs off on them.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday. </p>

<h2 id="fighting-bots">Fighting bots</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;With great timing, a post by Nicolas titled “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/06/23/should-i-remove-this-blog-from-google-search&quot;&gt;Should I remove this blog from Google Search?&lt;/a&gt;” landed in my RSS feed earlier today. I’ve been thinking a lot about the current phase the web is going through, especially after reading all the various news related to Perplexity AI. I don’t think they’re especially bad or wrong in what they’re doing, I’m sure the other companies are equally as bad and they’re also not giving half of a fuck about ingesting whatever they can find if it helps make their products better. They don’t care about book authors, they don’t care about journalists and they for sure don’t care about small personal bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
That brings up the question: what do we do? What even can we do? It’s
obvious that robots.txt is no longer an option because most companies
don’t even bother checking it. We can try to block the user agents at a
server level but they can avoid that by simply sending a generic UA. We
could de-list our sites but that would make it very hard for actual
users to find our content and I suspect the point of writing for most of
us is to share and connect with others. The legal system sure ain’t
gonna fix this situation anytime soon. So what’s left? I guess there are
only two options left:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Accept the fact that some dickheads will do whatever they want because
that’s just the world we live in
</li>
<li>
Make everything private and only allow actual human beings access to our
content
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Both solutions are suboptimal. Reading Nicolas’s post made me also think
about something else. He wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the case of Perplexity for example, a company that obviously steals
content, lies, doesn’t really credit its sources, and — on top of it
all — ignores the robots.txt rules from websites. If I were the
TechCrunch, the New York Times, and the Financial Times of the world, I
would simply stop reporting on the company. Not a blip on the radar,
radio silence, except for their next fuck up. And then good luck finding
investors if no one talks about you. They had their chance, they blew
it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What if Google decided to do that? What if Google decided to not return
any result related to a company like Perplexity? I know it’s obviously
not going to happen but wouldn’t that be funny?

id="democrats-wrestle-with-whether-to-attend-netanyahus-address-to-congress">Democrats
wrestle with whether to attend Netanyahu’s address to Congress</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The last time Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
addressed the U.S. Congress, nearly 60 Democrats skipped his speech nine
years ago, calling it a slap in the face to then-President Barack Obama
as he negotiated a nuclear deal with Iran.</p>
<p>With Netanyahu scheduled to address U.S. lawmakers on July 24 and his
government now at war with Hamas in Gaza, the number of absences is
likely to be far greater.</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats are wrestling with whether to attend. Many
are torn between their long-standing support for Israel and their
anguish about the way Israel has conducted military operations in Gaza.
More than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the
Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that triggered the war, according to the Health
Ministry in Hamas-run territory. The ministry does not differentiate
between civilians and combatants in its figures.</p>
<p>While some Democrats are saying they will come out of respect for
Israel, a larger and growing faction wants no part of it, creating an
extraordinarily charged atmosphere at a gathering that normally amounts
to a ceremonial, bipartisan show of support for an American ally.</p>
<p>“I wish that he would be a statesman and do what is right for Israel.
We all love Israel,” former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said
recently on CNN about Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Tensions between Netanyahu and Democratic President Joe Biden have
been seeping into the public, with Netanyahu last week accusing the
Biden administration of withholding U.S. weapons from Israel — a claim
he made again Sunday to his Cabinet. After the prime minister leveled
the charge the first time, White House press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre said, “We genuinely do not know what he’s talking about. We
just don’t.”</p>
<p>The invitation from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to Netanyahu
came after consultation with the White House, according to a person
familiar with the matter who was granted anonymity to discuss the
sensitive subject. As of now, no meeting between the leaders during
Netanyahu’s Washington visit has been scheduled, this person said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said in a release that he was “very moved” by the
invitation to address Congress and the chance “to present the truth
about our just war against those who seek to destroy us to the
representatives of the American people and the entire world.”</p>
<p>Republicans first floated the idea in March of inviting Netanyahu
after Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish
official in the United States, gave a speech on the Senate floor that
was harshly critical of the prime minister. Schumer, D-N.Y., called the
Israeli leader “an obstacle to peace” and urged new elections in Israel,
even as he denounced Hamas and criticized Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas.</p>
<p>Republicans denounced the speech as an affront to Israel and its
sovereignty. Johnson spoke of asking Netanyahu to come to Washington, an
invitation that Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of
New York ultimately endorsed, albeit reluctantly. Pelosi, who opposed
the invitation to Netanyahu in 2015 when she was Democratic leader, said
it was a mistake for the congressional leadership to extend it again
this time.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who attended the 2015
address as a House member, said he saw no reason why Congress “should
extend a political lifeline” to Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
said it would be “healthy” for members of both parties to attend. “I
think that a lot of Americans are getting a one-sided narrative,
especially the younger generation, and I think it’s important they hear
from the prime minister of Israel, in terms of his perspective,” said
McCaul, R-Texas.</p>
<p>Interviews with more than a dozen Democrats revealed the breadth of
discontent over the coming address, which many feel is a Republican ploy
intended to divide their party. Some Democrats say they will attend to
express their support for Israel, not Netanyahu.</p>
<p>New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said he has an “obligation” to attend because of that
position.</p>
<p>Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., who leads the Sente Foreign Relations
Committee, has signaled he will be there. Cardin said that what he’s
looking for in Netanyahu’s speech is a “type of message that can
strengthen the support in this country for Israel’s needs,” but also lay
the groundwork for peace in the region.</p>
<p>Other Democrats are waiting to see whether Netanyahu will still be
prime minister by the time he is supposed to speak to Congress.</p>
<p>There have been open signs of discontent over the handling of the war
by Netanyahu’s government, a coalition that includes right-wing
hard-liners who oppose any kind of settlement with Hamas.</p>
<p>Benny Gantz, a former military chief and centrist politician,
withdrew from Netanyahu’s war Cabinet this month, citing frustration
over the prime minister’s conduct of the war. On Monday, Netanyahu
dissolved that body.</p>
<p>Rep. Seth Magaziner, D-R.I., said he stands with those “who hope that
he’s not prime minister by the time late July rolls around. I think that
he has been bad for Israel, bad for Palestinians, bad for America.” But,
he added, he believes it his job to show up when a head of state
addresses Congress, “even if its someone who I have concerns about and
disagree with.”</p>
<p>Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., attended the 2015 speech and described it as
“among the most painful hours” he has spent while in Congress. He plans
to boycott unless Netanyahu became a “champion for a cease-fire.”</p>
<p>A large portion of the Congressional Progressive Caucus — lawmakers
who are among the most critical of Israel’s handling of the war — is
expected to skip. Among them is Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the
chair of the caucus, who told The Associated Press that it was a “bad
idea,” to invite Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s visit is expected to draw significant protests.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-all-these-ground-level-ozone-alerts">What Are All These
Ground-Level Ozone Alerts?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ4MTE2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0Njk4MjIzNn0.t1ATfNp4EGBfnG68XEWjyzDY-lcLfamjjY7Ea72O6qw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
If you’re of a certain age, you probably remember the hole in the ozone
layer. Like Joseph Kony and Livestrong wristbands, the obsession over O3
now feels like a cultural artifact, thanks to ozone depletion being one
of the rare success stories of international environmental cooperation.
Since the world banned chlorofluorocarbons under the Montreal Protocol
in 1987, the holes over the North and South poles have
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/09/climate/ozone-hole-restoration-montreal-protocol.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>steadily
recovered</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, if you hear about “ozone” at all, it’s much more likely to be
from an air quality alert on your phone. Unlike the stratospheric ozone
that we were all so concerned about in the 1980s and 1990s, which makes
up a protective layer around the planet that insulates us from the sun’s
cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, “tropospheric” or “ground-level” ozone
is mainly man-made. In fact, when people throw around the word
“pollution,” what they’re <em><em>probably</em></em> talking about is
ground-level ozone, which is created by a chemical reaction between
nitrogen oxides (highly reactive gases produced by burning fuels) and
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/technical-overview-volatile-organic-compounds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>volatile
organic compounds</u></a> (organic compounds that easily evaporate under
normal environmental conditions and can be found in vehicle exhaust as
well as scented personal care products like deodorants, lotions, and bug
sprays), plus sunlight. This chemical reaction usually occurs when cars,
refineries, power plants,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lng-front-line-communities-louisiana" target="_self"><u>and
other industrial sources</u></a> emit pollutants into the environment
during a hot, clear day. You probably know the result by its other name:
smog.
</p>
<p>
Ozone is a climate issue not just because it is yet another concerning
consequence of burning fossil fuels. According to some estimates, high
levels of ground-level ozone pollution could grow in frequency by
<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/04/the-complex-relationship-between-heat-and-ozone/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>three
to nine additional days per year</u></a> by 2050 because of the gas’s
close relationship with intense sunlight and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change#:~:text=Heat%20waves%20and%20heat%20domes" target="_self"><u>high
temperatures</u></a>. While ozone dissipates
<a href="https://www.ccacoalition.org/short-lived-climate-pollutants/tropospheric-ozone" target="_blank">fairly
quickly</a> once those conditions go away, it can build up while they
last. Hot days, which are increasing in the U.S., also coincide with
weak winds and stagnant air — conditions that allow ozone to accumulate
in one place.
</p>
<p>
When the temperatures start to rise, here’s what you need to know and
what you can do to protect yourself and others from ozone pollution.
</p>
<h3>
How worried should I be when I get an air quality alert for ground-level
ozone?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Different pollutants cause concern at different concentrations. The Air
Quality Index is
<a href="https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/" target="_blank"><u>designed</u></a>
so that, in theory, a level of “100” corresponds to the point at which
people in sensitive populations might start to be affected by the
pollutant in question. (To learn more about how the AQI is calculated,
you can read our explainer
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/air-quality-safe" target="_self"><u>here</u></a>).
</p>
<p>
That said, “The evidence has clearly been increasing that lower levels
of ozone — levels well below the current standard of 70 parts per
billion — are causing more health impacts,” Katherine Pruitt, the
national senior director of policy at the American Lung Association,
which is
<a href="https://a.lung.org/a4uvkzw?_ga=2.237242432.1103150728.1718905349-154044302.1718905349&_gl=1*1u6zfom*_gcl_au*MTMyMzU3Nzg5Ni4xNzE4OTA1MzQ5*_ga*MTU0MDQ0MzAyLjE3MTg5MDUzNDk.*_ga_P13PC1PGW8*MTcxODk4ODY4MS4yLjAuMTcxODk4ODY4My41OC4wLjA." target="_blank"><u>campaigning</u></a>
to strengthen the standard to 55 to 60 parts per billion, told me.
</p>
<p>
As Pruitt explained, ozone is a caustic irritant and can
<a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/6268026" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>corrode
metals</u></a>. Breathing it in can cause inflammation in anyone, “from
vulnerable children and elders to even the fittest elite athletes,”
Pruitt said, adding that it is, “at some level, like getting a sunburn
on your lungs.” Anyone who spends time outside is vulnerable to ozone,
but the more sensitive groups — including children; the elderly; people
with asthma, chronic heart disease, and other diseases; and pregnant
women — are at a higher risk. They might already be paying more
attention to the AQI levels in their area, and will potentially notice
that they need to slow down and limit exertion during “yellow” or
“orange”-level ozone events.
</p>
<p>
In the short term,
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ground-level-ozone-pollution/health-effects-ozone-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ozone
pollution can cause</u></a> coughing, shortness of breath, and a lowered
immune response, on top of aggravating any preexisting lung conditions
or diseases. But Pruitt stressed to me that “living in places that have
high levels of ozone day in and day out, for months and years, can cause
respiratory diseases, nervous system disorders, metabolic disorders,
reproductive problems, and mortality. It’s not just a cough and a wheeze
on one bad air day.”
</p>
<h3>
Where are the worst places in the country for ozone?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Ozone requires two main ingredients: the burning of fossil fuels and
other chemicals, and sunlight. While ozone concentrations can be high in
communities with a lot of industry and freeways nearby, ozone is “not
really so much a roadway problem; it’s more of what we call an ambient
air pollutant,” Pruitt said. Ozone can travel far away from where it was
produced, in other words.
</p>
<p>
There are some rules of thumb, though. The places with the highest
emissions and most appropriate atmospheric conditions for ozone
pollution are “increasingly the western U.S. and the Southwest,” Pruitt
said. The
<a href="https://www.lung.org/media/press-releases/sota-2024#:~:text=2.4%20million%20fewer%20people%20lived,over%20the%20last%2025%20years." target="_blank"><u>top
four worst cities for ozone</u></a> on the 2024 State of the Air report
by the ALA were all in California, led by Los Angeles and Long Beach.
</p>
<p>
Since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1963, other regions of the
country have been doing much better, including the Southeast,
mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. (Bangor, Maine, had the cleanest air in the
report.)
</p>
<h3>
What can I do to protect myself?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Because ozone is so strongly related to sunlight, it does not cause
indoor air pollution
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/when-theres-smoke-getting-indoors-isnt-enough" target="_self"><u>to
the same extent as wildfire smoke</u></a><strong> </strong>(which, if
you’re keeping score, is a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/how-many-people-will-this-smoke-kill" target="_self"><u>PM2.5
pollutant</u></a>). “Because it’s so reactive, it gloms onto your
furniture and your walls and stuff, once it gets inside,” Pruitt said of
ozone. To protect yourself, you can just stay indoors and run your air
conditioner.
</p>
<p>
But what if you want or need to go out? Because ozone is a gas rather
than a particle, HEPA filters and face masks won’t protect you. Instead,
Pruitt said that you can time your errands, tend to your garden, and
exercise when the sunlight is the weakest — mornings, especially, tend
to be less demanding on the lungs during ozone events.
</p>
<h3>
What can I do to protect others?
</h3>
<br/>
<p>
The Clean Air Act of 1963 requires the Environmental Protection Agency
to review the national ambient air quality standards for ozone (as well
as several other pollutants) every five years. “It almost never actually
does it every five years” though, Pruitt said. “Sometimes advocates have
to sue them to get them to move things along.” The EPA completed its
last review in December 2020, with the Trump administration
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/12/23/trump-smog-rule/" target="_blank"><u>maintaining</u></a>
the 70 parts per billion standard set in 2015. Attacks on the Clean Air
Act would likely
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/epa-rescinds-trump-move-that-changed-how-agency-weighs-costs-benefits-new-rules-2021-05-13/" target="_blank"><u>resume</u></a>
if Trump
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>retakes
office</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Aside from agitating for stricter clean air standards, there are
measures you can take to protect others from ozone events. The simplest
is not to contribute any more nitrogen oxides and volatile organic
compounds to the environment than you otherwise have to when ozone
levels are high. Avoid driving or idling your car; top off your tank
during <a href="https://www.cabq.gov/ozone" target="_blank"><u>the
coolest parts of the day</u></a>, such as after dark; minimize your
electricity use; and
<a href="https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/reducepollution.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>set
your air conditioner</u></a> no lower than 78 degrees.
</p>
<p>
In the long term, reducing ozone pollution will mean “choosing greener
products for cleaning and personal care, so that we’re not producing
volatile organic compounds,” Pruitt told me. The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration
<a href="https://research.noaa.gov/2021/08/03/fragrant-consumer-products-a-key-source-of-ozone-forming-pollution-in-new-york-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>previously
found</u></a> that in New York City in 2018, “about half” of the ambient
volatile organic compounds it measured were produced by people, not
vehicle exhaust. (Here’s
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/well/live/personal-care-products-chemicals.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
guide</u></a> to reducing VOCs from your rotation.)
</p>
<p>
Additionally, “transitioning to zero-emission technologies so we’re not
burning fossil fuels” will help limit ozone pollution, Pruitt said. The
difference can be pretty significant: A study from the University of
Houston published earlier this month found that by
<a href="https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2024/june/06032024-ev-air-quality-cities.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>switching
to electric vehicles</u></a>, New York and Chicago could prevent 796 and
328 premature pollution-related deaths per month, respectively.
Counterintuitively,
<a href="https://uh.edu/news-events/stories/2024/june/06032024-ev-air-quality-cities.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
study</u></a> found that more EVs on the roads could <em>increase</em>
mortality in Los Angeles due to a corresponding increase in secondary
organic aerosols caused by complicated dynamics between nitrogen oxides
and volatile organic compounds and the city’s unique geography. “This
underscores the need for region-specific environmental regulations,” the
authors said.

may soon return land US stole from Prairie Band Potawatomi chief 175
years ago</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Some 175 years after the U.S. government stole
land from the chief of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation while he was
away visiting relatives, Illinois may soon return it to the tribe.</p>
<p>Nothing ever changed the 1829 treaty that Chief Shab-eh-nay signed
with the U.S. government to preserve for him a reservation in northern
Illinois: not subsequent accords nor the 1830 Indian Removal Act, which
forced all indigenous people to move west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>But around 1848, the U.S. sold the land to white settlers while
Shab-eh-nay and other members of his tribe were visiting family in
Kansas. </p>
<p>To right the wrong, Illinois would transfer a 1,500-acre
(607-hectare) state park west of Chicago, which was named after
Shab-eh-nay, to the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation. The state would
continue providing maintenance while the tribe says it wants to keep the
park as it is. </p>
<p>“The average citizen shouldn’t know that title has been transferred
to the nation so they can still enjoy everything that’s going on within
the park and take advantage of all of that area out there,” said Joseph
“Zeke” Rupnick, chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation based in
Mayetta, Kansas.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely the same soil that the U.S. took from Chief
Shab-eh-nay. The boundaries of his original 1,280-acre (518-hectare)
reservation now encompass hundreds of acres of privately owned land, a
golf course and county forest preserve. The legislation awaiting
Illinois House approval would transfer the Shabbona Lake State
Recreation Area.</p>
<p>No one disputes Shab-eh-nay’s reservation was illegally sold and
still belongs to the Potawatomi. An exactingly researched July 2000 memo
from the Interior Department found the claim valid and shot down
rebuttals from Illinois officials at the time, positing, “It appears
that Illinois officials are struggling with the concept of having an
Indian reservation in the state.”</p>
<p>But nothing has changed a quarter-century later.</p>
<p>Democratic state Rep. Will Guzzardi, who sponsored the legislation to
transfer the state park, said it is a significant concession on the part
of the Potawatomi. With various private and public concerns now owning
more than half of the original reservation land, reclaiming it for the
Potawatomi would set up a serpentine legal wrangle.</p>
<p>“Instead, the tribe has offered a compromise, which is to say, ‘We’ll
take the entirety of the park and give up our claim to the private land
and the county land and the rest of that land,’” Guzzardi said. “That’s
a better deal for all parties involved.”</p>
<p>The proposed transfer of the park, which is 68 miles (109 kilometers)
west of Chicago, won Senate approval in the final days of the spring
legislative session. But a snag in the House prevented its passage.
Proponents will seek endorsement of the measure when the Legislature
returns in November for its fall meeting.</p>
<p>The Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1829 guaranteed the original
land to Chief Shab-eh-ney. The tribe signed 20 other treaties during the
next 38 years, according to Rupnick.</p>
<p>“Yet Congress still kept those two sections of land for Chief
Shab-eh-nay and his descendants forever,” said Rupnick, a fourth
great-grandson of Shab-eh-nay. “At any one of those times the Congress
could have removed the status of that land. They never did.”</p>
<p>Key to the proposal is a management agreement between the tribe and
the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Rupnick said the tribe
needs the state’s help to maintain the park.</p>
<p>Many residents who live next to the park oppose the plan, fearing
construction of a casino or even a hotel would draw more tourists and
lead to a larger, more congested community.</p>
<p>“Myself and my family have put a lot of money and given up a lot to
be where we are in a small community and enjoy the park the way that it
is,” resident Becky Oest told a House committee in May, asking that the
proposal be amended to prohibit construction that would “affect our
community. It’s a small town. We don’t want it to grow bigger.”</p>
<p>Rupnick said a casino doesn’t make sense because state-sanctioned
gambling boats already dot the state. He did not rule out a hotel,
noting the park draws 500,000 visitors a year and the closest lodging is
in DeKalb, 18 miles (29 kilometers) northeast of Shabbona. The park has
150 campsites.</p>
<p>In 2006, the tribe purchased 128 acres (52 hectares) in a corner of
the original reservation and leases the land for farming. The U.S.
government in April certified that as the first reservation in
Illinois.</p>
<p>Guzzardi hopes the Potawatomi don’t have to wait much longer to see
that grow exponentially with the park transfer.</p>
<p>“It keeps this beautiful public asset available to everyone,”
Guzzardi said. “It resolves disputed title for landholders in the area
and most importantly, it fixes a promise that we broke.”</p>

id="abortion-access-has-won-when-its-been-on-the-ballot-but-not-option-for-half-the-states">Abortion
access has won when it’s been on the ballot, but not option for half the
states</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Tucked inside the West Virginia Statehouse is a
copy of a petition to lawmakers with a simple request: Let the voters
decide whether to reinstate legal access to abortion.</p>
<p>The request has been ignored by the Republican lawmakers who have
supermajority control in the Legislature and banned abortions in the
state in 2022, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a
constitutional right to the procedure.</p>
<p>The petition, with more than 2,500 signatures, is essentially
meaningless given the current makeup of the Legislature. But it
illustrates the frustratingly limited options millions of Americans face
in trying to re-establish abortion rights as the country marks the
two-year anniversary since the Supreme Court’s ruling.</p>
<p>West Virginia is among the 25 states that do not allow citizen
initiatives or constitutional amendments on a statewide ballot, an
avenue of direct democracy that has allowed voters to circumvent their
legislatures and preserve abortion and other reproductive rights in a
number of states over the past two years.</p>
<p>Republicans there have repeatedly dismissed the idea of placing an
abortion-rights measure before voters, which in West Virginia is a step
only lawmakers can take.</p>
<p>“It makes you wonder what they’re so afraid of,” said Democratic Del.
Kayla Young, one of only 16 women in the West Virginia Legislature. “If
they feel so strongly that this is what people believe, prove it.”</p>
<p>The court’s ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade was praised by abortion
opponents as a decision that returned the question to the states. Former
President Donald Trump, who named three of the justices who overturned
Roe, has repeatedly claimed “the people” are now the ones deciding
abortion access.</p>
<p>“The people are deciding,” he said during a recent interview with Fox
News host Sean Hannity. “And in many ways, it’s a beautiful thing to
watch.”</p>
<p>But that’s not true everywhere. In states allowing the citizen
initiative and where abortion access has been on the ballot, voters have
resoundingly affirmed the right to abortion.</p>
<p>Voters in seven states, including conservative ones such as Kentucky,
Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated
attempts to curtail them in statewide votes over the past two years.
Reproductive rights supporters are trying to put citizen initiatives on
the ballot in several states this year.</p>
<p>But voters don’t have a direct say in about half the states.</p>
<p>This is particularly true for those living in the South.
Republican-controlled legislatures, many of which have been heavily
gerrymandered to give the GOP disproportionate power, have enacted some
of the strictest abortion bans since the Supreme Court ruling while
shunning efforts to expand direct democracy.</p>
<p>States began adopting the initiative process during the Progressive
Era more than a century ago, giving citizens a way to make or repeal
laws through a direct vote of the people. Between 1898 and 1918, nearly
20 states approved the citizen initiative. Since then, just five states
have done so.</p>
<p>“It was a different time,” said John Matsusaka, professor of business
and law at the University of Southern California. “There was a political
movement across the whole country when people were trying to do what
they saw as good government.”</p>
<p>Some lawmakers argue citizen initiatives bypass important checks and
balances offered through the legislative process. In Tennessee, where
Republicans have gerrymandered legislative districts to give them a
supermajority in the statehouse, House Majority Leader William Lamberth
likened ballot measures to polls rather than what he described as the
legislature’s strict review of complicated policy-making.</p>
<p>“We evaluate bills every single year,” he said.</p>
<p>As in West Virginia, abortion-rights supporters or Democratic
lawmakers have asked Republican-controlled legislatures in a handful of
states to take the abortion question straight to voters, a tactic that
hasn’t succeeded anywhere the GOP has a majority.</p>
<p>“This means you’re going to say, ‘Hey Legislature, would you like to
give up some of your power? Would you like to give up your monopoly on
policymaking?’” said Thad Kousser, professor of political science at the
University of California, San Diego. “You need a political momentum and
then have the process cooperate.”</p>
<p>In South Carolina, which bans nearly all abortions, a
Democratic-backed resolution to put a state constitutional amendment on
the ballot never got a hearing this year. Attempts to attach the
proposal to other pieces of legislation were quickly shut down by
Republicans.</p>
<p>“If you believe you are doing the right thing for all the people of
South Carolina — men and women and babies — you should have no problem
putting this to the people,” said Democratic Sen. Margie Bright
Matthews, alleging that Republicans fear they would lose if the issue
went directly to voters.</p>
<p>In Georgia, Democratic Rep. Shea Roberts said she frequently fields
questions from her constituents asking how they can get involved in a
citizen-led ballot measure. The interest exploded after voters in Kansas
rejected an anti-abortion measure from the Legislature in 2022 and was
rekindled last fall after Ohio voters overwhelmingly passed an amendment
codifying abortion rights in the state’s constitution.</p>
<p>Yet when she has brought legislation to create a citizen initiative
process in Georgia, the efforts have been ignored inside the
Republican-controlled Legislature.</p>
<p>“Voters are constantly asking us why we can’t do this, and we’re
constantly explaining that it’s not possible under our current
constitution,” Roberts said. “If almost half of states have this
process, why shouldn’t Georgians?”</p>
<p>The contrast is on stark display in two presidential swing states.
Michigan voters used a citizen initiative to enshrine abortion rights in
their state constitution in 2022. Voters in neighboring Wisconsin don’t
have that ability.</p>
<p>Instead, Wisconsin Democrats, with a new liberal majority on the
state Supreme Court, are working to overturn Republican-drawn
legislative maps that are among the most gerrymandered in the country in
the hope of eventually flipping the Legislature.</p>
<p>Analiese Eicher, director of communications at Planned Parenthood
Advocates of Wisconsin, said a citizen-led ballot measure process would
have been especially valuable for her cause.</p>
<p>“We should have legislators who represent their constituents,” she
said. “And if they don’t, there should be another option.”</p>
<p>In West Virginia, Steve Williams acknowledges the petition he
spearheaded didn’t change minds inside the Legislature.</p>
<p>But the Democratic mayor of Huntington, who is a longshot candidate
for governor, said he thinks state Republicans have underestimated how
strongly voters believe in restoring some kind of abortion access.  </p>
<p>Republican leadership has pointed to a 2018 vote in which just under
52% of voters supported a constitutional amendment saying there is no
right to abortion access in the state. But Williams said the vote also
had to do with state funding of abortion, which someone could oppose
without wanting access completely eliminated.</p>
<p>The vote was close, voter participation was low and it came before
the Supreme Court’s decision that eliminated a nationwide right to
abortion. Williams said West Virginia women weren’t facing the reality
of a near-total ban.</p>
<p>“Let’s face it: Life in 2024 is a heck of a lot different for women
than it was in 2018,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="israel-defense-chief-to-discuss-gaza-lebanon-on-us-trip">Israel
defense chief to discuss Gaza, Lebanon on US trip</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Jerusalem — Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant headed to
Washington on Sunday to discuss the next phase of the Gaza war and
escalating hostilities on the border with Lebanon, where exchanges of
fire with Hezbollah have stoked fears of wider conflict.</p>
<p>Iran-backed Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel since the
Gaza war erupted more than eight months ago. The group has said it will
not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.</p>
<p>“We are prepared for any action that may be required in Gaza,
Lebanon, and in more areas,” Gallant said in a statement before setting
off to Washington, where he said he will meet his counterpart Lloyd
Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, Hezbollah targeted Israeli towns and military sites
with the largest volleys of rockets and drones in the hostilities so
far, after an Israeli strike killed the most senior Hezbollah commander
yet.</p>
<p>U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein visited Israel and Lebanon last week in an
attempt to cool tensions, amid an uptick in cross-border fire and an
escalation in rhetoric on both sides.</p>
<p>Some Israeli officials have linked the ongoing Israeli push into
Rafah, the southern area of Gaza where it says it is targeting the last
battalions of militant Islamist group Hamas, to a potential focus on
Lebanon.</p>
<p>Gallant appeared to make the same link in his statement.</p>
<p>“The transition to Phase C in Gaza is of great importance. I will
discuss this transition with U.S. officials, how it may enable
additional things and I know that we will achieve close cooperation with
the U.S. on this issue as well,” Gallant said.</p>
<p>Scaling back Gaza operations would free up forces to take on
Hezbollah, were Israel to launch a ground offensive or step up its
aerial bombardments.</p>
<p>Officials have described the third and last phase of Israel’s Gaza
offensive as winding down fighting while stepping up efforts to
stabilize a post-Hamas rule and begin reconstruction in the enclave,
much of which has been laid to waste.</p>
<p>Gallant, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud party,
has sparred with the premier in the past few months, calling for a
clearer post-war plan for Gaza that will not leave Israel in charge, a
demand echoed by the White House.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has been walking a tightrope as he seeks to keep his
government together by balancing the demands of the defence
establishment, including ex-generals like Gallant, and far-right
coalition partners who have resisted any post-Gaza strategy that could
open the way to a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>The head of Israel’s parliamentary Foreign Affairs and Defence
Committee, Yuli Edelstein, told Army Radio on Sunday that fighting
Hezbollah would be complex either way, now or later.</p>
<p>“We are not in the right position to conduct fighting on both the
southern front and the northern front. We will have to deploy
differently in the south in order to fight in the north,” said
Edelstein, also a Likud member.</p>
<p>Edelstein criticized a video by Netanyahu released last week in which
the prime minister said the Biden administration was “withholding
weapons and ammunitions to Israel.” The video led to a spat with the
White House.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration paused a shipment of 2,000 pound
and 500-pound bombs in May over concerns about their impact if used in
densely-populated areas of Gaza. Israel was still due to get billions of
dollars worth of U.S. weaponry.</p>
<p>“I hope that in the discussions behind closed doors much more will be
achieved than by attempts to create pressure with videos,” Edelstein
said, referring to Gallant’s trip.</p>
<p>Israel’s ground and air campaign in Gaza was triggered when Hamas-led
militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200
people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli
tallies.</p>
<p>The offensive has killed more than 37,400 people, according to
Palestinian health authorities, and left nearly the entire population of
the enclave homeless and destitute.</p>

id="fbi-offers-reward-for-information-about-deadly-southern-new-mexico-wildfires">FBI
offers reward for information about deadly southern New Mexico
wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RUIDOSO, N.M. — Federal authorities offered a reward for information
about those responsible for igniting a pair of New Mexico wildfires that
killed two people and destroyed hundreds of homes in the past week.</p>
<p>The FBI on Saturday offered up to $10,000 for information in
connection with the South Fork Fire and Salt Fire in southern New
Mexico, which forced thousands to flee.</p>
<p>An agency statement said it was seeking public assistance in
“identifying the cause” of the fires near Ruidoso, New Mexico, that were
discovered June 17. But the notice also pointedly suggested human hands
were to blame, saying the reward was for information leading to arrest
and conviction of “the person or persons responsible for starting the
fires.”</p>
<p>The South Fork Fire, which reached 26 square miles (67 square
kilometers), was 26% contained on Saturday, while the Salt Fire, at 12
square miles (31 square kilometers), was 7% contained as of Saturday
morning, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Full
containment was not expected until July 15.</p>
<p>Recent rains and cooler weather have assisted more than 1,000
firefighters working to contain the fires. Fire crews on Saturday took
advantage of temperatures in the 70s  Fahrenheit (21 to 26 Celsius),
scattered showers and light winds to use bulldozers to dig protective
lines while hand crews used shovels in more rugged terrain to battle the
fires near the mountain village of Ruidoso.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in New Mexico, heavy rain and flash flood warnings prompted
officials to order some mandatory evacuations Friday in the city of Las
Vegas, New Mexico, and communities near Albuquerque, about 200 miles
(320 kilometers) north of Ruidoso. Las Vegas set up shelters for
displaced residents, and some evacuation orders remained in place there
on Saturday.</p>
<p>Flash flood warnings were canceled Saturday, though the National
Weather Service said afternoon storms could produce excessive runoff and
more flooding in the area.</p>
<p>The wildfires have destroyed or damaged an estimated 1,400
structures. Other fallout from the fires, including downed power lines,
damaged water, sewer and gas lines, flooding in burn scars, continued
“to pose risks to firefighters and the public,” according to a Saturday
update from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources
Department. </p>
<p>Evacuations in areas near Ruidoso and road closures were still in
effect. In Ruidoso, full-time residents will be allowed to return
Monday, though everyday life won’t return to normal.</p>
<p>“You’re going to need to bring a week’s worth of food, you’re going
to need to bring drinking water,” Mayor Lynn Crawford said on
Facebook. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for parts of
southern New Mexico on Thursday, freeing up funding and more resources
to help with recovery efforts including temporary housing, low-cost
loans to cover uninsured property and other emergency work in Lincoln
County and on lands belonging to the Mescalero Apache Tribe.</p>
<p>Deanne Criswell, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, met with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Crawford and Mescalero
Apache President Thora Walsh Padilla on Saturday. “These communities
have our support for as long as it takes to recover,” Criswell posted on
the social media platform X.</p>
<p>Much of the Southwest has been exceedingly dry and hot in recent
months. Those conditions, along with strong wind, whipped the flames out
of control, rapidly advancing the South Fork Fire into Ruidoso in a
matter of hours. Evacuations extended to hundreds of homes, businesses,
a regional medical center and the Ruidoso Downs horse track.</p>
<p>Nationwide, wildfires have scorched more than 3,344 square miles
(8,660 square kilometers) this year, a figure higher than the 10-year
average, according to the National Interagency Fire Center.</p>

<h2 id="us-political-trailblazer-shirley-chisholm-honored-in-exhibit">US
political trailblazer Shirley Chisholm honored in exhibit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — She was the first African American woman in U.S. Congress
and the first woman and African American to seek the presidential
nomination from one of the two major U.S. political parties.</p>
<p>Shirley Chisholm, who would have turned 100 in November, has served
as an inspiration to several generations of female and minority
politicians, including current Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Less than five months before a hotly contested presidential election
pitting Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump, the Museum of
the City of New York is honoring Chisholm’s legacy with a special
exhibit.</p>
<p>Zinga Fraser, the co-curator of the show titled “Changing the Face of
Democracy: Shirley Chisholm at 100” said honoring the politician’s
legacy is even more important during an election year.</p>
<p>“If there’s any person to remind us about democracy and what’s
possible and where we need to go,” that would be Chisholm, Fraser
said.</p>
<p>Writing on Chisholm’s birthday on November 30, 2020 — after Harris
had just been elected the first African American vice president and the
first woman in that role — Harris said Chisholm “paved the way for me
and so many others.”</p>
<p>“We celebrate her brilliance and boldness to break down barriers,
fight to increase the minimum wage, and speak for those who otherwise
wouldn’t have a voice in the political process,” Harris wrote on
Instagram.</p>
<p>Catalyst for change</p>
<p>Born in 1924 in Brooklyn, New York, to parents from Barbados and
Guyana, Chisholm transformed American democracy in the 1960s and 1970s
with her political slogan “Unbought and Unbossed.”</p>
<p>In 1968, Chisholm became the first Black woman elected to Congress
and four years later launched a bid for the White House. While she
didn’t win the nomination of the Democratic Party, she still served as a
catalyst for change.</p>
<p>“I ran because somebody had to do it first,” she reflected later. “I
ran because most people think the country is not ready for a Black
candidate, not ready for a woman candidate. Someday …”</p>
<p>During her political career, Chisholm fought for abortion rights,
food assistance, education and worker protection, as well as police and
prison reform. She also campaigned against the war in Vietnam and
apartheid in South Africa.</p>
<p>But even more important is the example she set, according to
Fraser.</p>
<p>“I think what you also see as a part of her legacy is just more in
terms of women and women of color in the office,” Fraser said.</p>
<p>Before Chisholm was elected to the House of Representatives in 1968,
there were only four Black men and 11 white women or other minorities in
Congress.</p>
<p>According to the Center for American Women and Politics, there are
now 28 Black women in the House (out of 435 representatives, including
126 women) and one in the Senate (out of 100 senators, including 25
women).</p>
<p>‘Shirley’ on Netflix</p>
<p>During the 1972 primaries, Chisholm recruited student and activist
Barbara Lee, who went on to serve as California’s Democratic
representative in the House since 1998.</p>
<p>“Shirley Chisholm was more than a mentor to me,” 77-year-old Lee
wrote on X. “She inspired me to live a life of service, fearlessness,
&amp; dedication to justice &amp; equity.”</p>
<p>Chisholm, who died in 2005, also is being honored this year by a
Netflix documentary that was released in March.</p>
<p>In “Shirley,” the trailblazing politician, played by actress Regina
King, confronts other lawmakers and decides to compete in the primaries
alone.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: OS News</p>
<p>Andrew S. Tanenbaum, professor emeritus of Computer Science at VU
Amsterdam, receives the ACM Software System Award for MINIX, which
influenced the teaching of Operating Systems principles to multiple
generations of students and contributed to the design of widely used
operating systems, including Linux. Tanenbaum created MINIX 1.0 in 1987
to accompany his textbook, Operating Systems: Design and Implementation.
MINIX was a small microkernel-based UNIX operating system for the IBM
PC, which was popular at the time. It was roughly 12,000 lines of code,
and in addition to the microkernel, included a memory manager, file
system and core UNIX utility programs. It became free open-source
software in 2000. ↫ VU Amsterdam website Definitely a deserved award for
Tanenbaum, and it’s a minuscule bit of pride that VU Amsterdam happens
to be my Alma mater. He also wrote an article for OSNews way back in
2006, detailing MINIX 3, which is definitely a cool notch to have on our
belt.</p>

board of directors do?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-23, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>

[<a href="https://www.anildash.com/2024/06/20/dash-board/">Anil
Dash</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“I realize that most people who’ve never been in the boardroom have a
lot of questions (and often, anxieties) about what happens on a board,
so I wanted to share a very subjective view of what I’ve seen and
learned over the years.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is great, and jibes with my experiences both being on boards and
supporting them as a part of various organizations.
</p>
<p>
The most functional boards I’ve seen do what Anil describes here:
they’re pre-briefed and are ready to have a substantive discussion in a
way that pushes the organization forward. Board meetings have a heavy
reporting component, for sure, but the discussion and working sessions
are always the most meaningful component.
</p>
<p>
This is also often true, and a challenge:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“I believe in the structure of a board (usually along with some separate
advisors) to help an organization reach its fullest potential, in much
the same way as I believe in governments having separate branches with
separate forms of accountability and appointment. In practice, having
nearly all-powerful executives select the membership of the organization
that’s meant to hold them accountable tends to fail just as badly in
business or non-profits as it does in governments.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The board meetings I’ve attended that are the most robust and open to
discussion and genuine debate have also been the ones attached to the
most successful companies. I don’t think it’s quite causation, but
rather two things that come from a particularly pragmatic attitude
towards running a business: one where outside perspectives and
differences of opinion are a strength, not a threat.
