years after Nixon’s resignation, some eerie parallels with Trump and the
Egypt story</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>

[<a href="https://dankennedy.net/2024/08/09/50-years-after-nixons-resignation-some-eerie-parallels-with-trump-and-the-egypt-story/">Dan
Kennedy at Media Nation</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Four years ago, Boston lawyer and journalist James Barron wrote that
the Watergate break-in may well have been an attempt to steal documents
from Democratic Party headquarters showing that Nixon had taken $549,000
from the Greek government in order to help finance his 1968 campaign.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dan Kennedy argues that there are parallels here with the story,
reported a year ago, that Donald Trump might have partially funded his
2016 election campaign with an illegal contribution from the Egyptian
government.
</p>
<p>
It does seem strange that the story hasn’t been followed up on by either
the press or the Democratic Party. What sticks out to me about Dan’s
commentary, though, is this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“What makes a story stick is repetition — and without prominent
Democrats coming out every day and giving journalists something to
report on, it quickly withers away.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Should that be true? I’d hope that the press could find their own leads.
Otherwise it, in effect, becomes a press release driven industry. I’m
not disputing that it probably <em>is</em> true in reality, but I’d hope
for a better dynamic.

Marketplace’s Nancy Marshall-Genzer has been gathering perspectives on
the economy from Kent County, Michigan — a swing county in a swing
state. More than that, the county is divided. And how people vote is
playing an increasingly large role in how well they view the economy.
Also: how consumers in China are feeling the pinch of rising prices, and
what a rate cut by the Federal Reserve would mean for consumer debt and
savings.

<h2 id="nncp-setup-automation">2024-08-09 NNCP setup automation</h2>

<h1 id="2024-08-09-nncp-setup-automation">
2024-08-09 NNCP setup automation
</h1>
<p>
This is a continuation of <a href="2024-07-16-minimal-nncp-setup">the
minimal NNCP setup to get started</a>. Once we verified that everything
works as expected with manual invocations, the next step is automation.
There are two options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Enable all the services. This makes sense if you expect a lot of
traffic.
</li>
<li>
Only call the executables every now and then. This makes sense if you
expect very little traffic.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want to enable all the services, the <code>examples</code>
directory has service definitions for you. Running
<code>nncp-caller</code> only makes sense if there is at least one entry
in your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> that has a <code>cron</code> key.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-daemon.service
sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-toss.service
sudo systemctl start nncp-daemon.service 
sudo systemctl start nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl start nncp-toss.service 
sudo systemctl status nncp-daemon.service 
sudo systemctl status nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl status nncp-toss.service 
</code></pre>
<p>
I don’t expect a lot of NNCP traffic. This is why my setup on the laptop
and server uses the alternative.
</p>
<p>
In order to conserve resources, you could decide not to have these
services running all the time. I’m doing this for two reasons: I don’t
want to upgrade the virtual machine I’m renting. It’s a point of pride
to do much with very little. From the perspective of impeding collapse,
I also think that we should all get on board with
<a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.codeberg.page/articles/frugal-computing-developer/">frugal
computing</a>
(<a class="account" href="https://scholar.social/@wim_v12e" title="@wim_v12e@scholar.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="wim_v12e">@wim_v12e</span></a>).
</p>
<p>
Ready for some frugal computing? Here we go.
</p>
<p>
Run the daemon on the server. That is, if other sites know your internet
address and call you, then you need this. My laptop does not but my
server does. When somebody calls the server on port 5400, start the
<code>nncp-daemon</code> using <code>inetd</code> (from the
<code>openbsd-inet</code> or the <code>inetutils-inetd</code> packages
on Debian).
</p>
<p>
In your <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> file:
</p>
<pre><code>5400 stream  tcp nowait  nncp    /usr/bin/nncp-daemon    nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>
<p>
Run <code>nncp-call</code> every hour or every day from cron for the
systems you want to call. Those systems don’t need a <code>cron</code>
key in the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file.
</p>
<p>
This is my laptop calling my server every hour, via
<code>/etc/cron.hourly/nncp</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-call ]; then
        su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-call sibirocobombus -noprogress&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p>
This is on the laptop, for my neighbours <code>erebor</code> and
<code>quux</code> in <code>/etc/cron.daily/nncp</code>:
</p>

Adding <code>autotoss: true</code> only helps for the system calling
others. On the server, tossing needs to happen on a regular basis.

Finally, you can do some clean-up by copying

<p>By the beginning of 2024, the war in Ukraine had inflicted over $150
billion of damage on Ukraine’s infrastructure, according to the Kyiv
School of Economics. But some scholars in the U.S., alongside Ukrainian
anti-corruption activists, are already looking ahead to the end of the
war and the opportunity to rebuild. Princeton University recently
created a legal database to help. Iuliia Iarmolenko has the story,

<h2 id="cosmic-alpha-released">COSMIC alpha released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>After two year of development, System76 has released the very first
alpha of COSMIC, their new Rust-based desktop environment for Linux.
This is an alpha release, so they make it clear there’s going to be bugs
and that there’s a ton of missing features at this point. As a whole,
COSMIC is a comprehensive operating system GUI (graphical user
interface) environment that features advanced functionality and a
responsive design. Its modular architecture is specifically designed to
facilitate the creation of unique, branded user experiences with ease. ↫
System76 website Don’t read too much into “branded experience” here – it
just means other Linux distributions can easily use their colours,
branding, and panel configurations. The settings application is also
entirely modular, so distributors can easily add additional panels, and
replace things like the update panel with one that fits their package
management system of choice. COSMIC also supports extensive theming, and
if you’re wondering – yes, all of these are answers to the very reason
COSMIC was made in the first place: GNOME’s restrictiveness. There’s not
much else to say here yet, since it’s an alpha release, but if you want
to give it a go, the announcement post contains links to instructions
for a variety of Linux distributions. COSMIC is also slowly making its
way into Redox, the Rust-based operating system led by Jeremy Soller, a
System76 employee.</p>

yesterday a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee of up to $1.45
billion for solar panel maker Qcells to support the construction of the
company’s new manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Georgia. The plant
would be Qcell’s second in Georgia, but the largest of its kind in the
U.S., churning out solar panel components like silicon ingots and
wafers, as well as finished solar panels. Its completion will
“re-establish critical parts of the domestic solar supply chain and
reinforce the United States’ status as a global clean energy leader,”
the Department of Energy said in a statement. The plant will create
1,950 jobs, and is expected to make 3.3 gigawatts of panels each year,
enough to power half a million homes. And it will be eligible for the
IRA’s clean-energy tax credits.

published in the journal <em>Science</em> examines how the Earth’s
plants and carbon cycle have responded in the past to climate change
caused by huge releases in carbon dioxide from volcanic activity. They
find that the severity of the fallout depended on how quickly the Earth
could sequester the carbon and remove it from the atmosphere, but also
how well plants could adapt to the resulting temperature changes. After
past volcanic eruptions, some plant species evolved to survive, some
migrated to cooler climates, but others were wiped out entirely. The
authors found that damages to vegetation made global warming worse in
the past. “This study, in my perspective, serves as a ‘wake-up call’ for
the global community,”

natural ecosystems to regulate the climate.”

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I’m Georgie and I was born and reside in Sydney, Australia. I grew up in
the ’burbs, which was something I despised until I moved to a spot
closer to the city, and there’s a certain nostalgia that Arcade Fire’s
The Suburbs evokes about my childhood that no other album or song has
done to date.
</p>
<p>
My first experience using a computer was when I was probably about four
years old, watching my dad type commands into MS-DOS to launch games.
When I couldn’t figure out how to load King’s Quest, I would just type
<code>dir</code> and press spacebar dozens of times for amusement until
my dad came to my aid. These days, I work as a software engineer and I
fell into this line of work after teaching myself how to code and build
websites, then trying to find data entry jobs, but realising there were
actually jobs for building websites.
</p>
<p>
I’ve competed in two powerlifting competitions (placing third and
second), I used to be a concert photographer and a ballerina, I like
hiking, and I am passionate about expressing myself through my style and
what I wear. One might describe my style as containing deliberate
elements of juxtaposition, and a blend of 80s, 90s, punk, and grunge. I
am a 90s kid, pretty much, but my interests and knowledge of pop culture
give people the impression that I’m an older millennial than I actually
am. I also still get ID’d, and it now amuses me since I’m old enough to
appreciate it. I’ll take what I can get.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
After playing Neopets in the early 2000s and then getting my account
banned because I was transferring items and neopoints to myself from a
secondary account, I started blogging on LiveJournal. My website was on
a free hosting site, and was my playground for practicing coding and
graphic design. I was writing about pretty inane stuff on LiveJournal,
and my website was reserved for updates about graphics, trivia and other
miscellanea I was adding to my website.
</p>
<p>
Since I had been writing in a physical diary for most of my childhood
and early adolescence, writing stuff online seemed like a fair
transition. It was also easier for me to let my friends read my diary if
it was on a website they could visit.
</p>
<p>
After LiveJournal, I blogged on MSN Spaces for a while. My blog was
called “Consolation in a Jar”, because I thought the visual of a jar was
cute (think those jars full of hand-made paper stars) and also because I
was going through a difficult time with severe depression.
</p>
<p>
I forget what my website’s name was when I first created it, but I
settled on the name “Out The Window”. I am pretty sure it came from the
Linkin Park song “In The End”. I started blogging about my school life
and hobbies, and more emotional posts found their home on Consolation in
a Jar.
</p>
<p>
In 2008 I registered my first domain name, Heartdrops.org. This is the
URL at which I gained a lot of notoriety, fame, what have you. MSN
Spaces had shut down, and I chose not to save all of the painful posts
I’d published. Heartdrops became my main blog, and would be that way for
four years. Facebook took off around this time, and I continued to
strongly hold the opinion that friends could contact me via phone number
or—quite literally—my website that I’d had years before social media.
</p>
<p>
I started a few other blogs for different creative projects, like
photoblogging, letters to friends, and scans of doodling and drawing on
paper. I went through a couple of cycles of starting new blogs for
specific topics, then pulling them all back into my main blog. Now I
like to have everything in the one place and feel free to use my space
to write about any topic I want.
</p>
<p>
I’d been using georgie.nu as a “domain collective”—a website to showcase
all of my domains and projects—for three years before I decided to name
rename Heartdrops to “Hey Georgie” and use the URL. I was working on an
exciting, bold WordPress theme that was a departure from my usual design
style, and didn’t suit the name Heartdrops. I started to feel like the
name was juvenile and reminded me too much of a difficult time in my
life.
</p>
<p>
My blog has been called Hey Georgie for the past 12 years now. I feel
like it suits my personality more accurately. The name just comes from
the greeting of “hey” or “hello”, but one of my favourite local bands is
called Hey Geronimo as well. I know I must have sounded like a hypocrite
when I renamed my blog because I used to diss people who had their name
in their website name. I said so much shit online in my youth. But damn,
have I learned. I have learned a lot.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
In my early years of blogging (from the mid to late 2000s), I would just
sit at my computer or laptop and write any time I wanted a blog post to
happen, or if I had an idea, I would try to write the blog post as soon
as possible. My ideas mostly revolved around funny stories from my
childhood, or experiences in my day to day as a suburban kid being in
the heart of the city for university and social events. I would usually
write a 500-word post in 30 minutes or so. I didn’t proofread. It was a
combination of being a little bit cocky and confident in my writing
skills and speed, and an obsession with posting something every two
days. I just wanted to write the blog post and be done, and took pride
in having something new to share.
</p>
<p>
My process is very different these days. I’ve not only matured, but the
blog posts I write are less stream-of-consciousness and centre around a
specific topic. They take a bit more time because I care about them
reading well and being well structured. My writing has matured the same
way I’ve matured as a person.
</p>
<p>
I stopped having the freedom to just drop everything and write as soon
as an idea came to mind, so I keep a list of ideas instead. I don’t have
as many ideas as I used to. When I think about why, I think it’s that I
don’t enjoy writing about the mundanities of life the way that I did as
an adolescent. (I promise my life is not boring… haha.) My interest in
writing about certain topics also waned. Any time I’m in the mood, I’ll
take one of those ideas and just start writing something until I get
stuck, then I leave the draft there and come back to it later. Some of
those drafts never see the light of day because I give up on the idea,
while others are eventually worked on and published. In the past, I had
the mentality of a completist and anything I worked on was published,
even if I thought it sucked. I still don’t proofread too meticulously,
and sometimes I even do it after I’ve published a post, because I am so
comfortable with my writing that there will usually only be some small
typos. If the topic is a really delicate one, I might ask a couple of
close friends to proofread it.
</p>
<p>
I used to use an app called Bear to help me focus while I was writing.
Now I just write most of my posts directly in my WordPress installation
or in the Notes app on my iPhone or MacBook. I can’t remember why I
abandoned Bear, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it had something to do
with paying for features that I refused to pay for.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
My physical space really influences my ability to write and put a blog
post together. I value my noise-cancelling headphones and a bit of
stoner rock or hard rock or metal. It’s music that’s energetic enough
because of the beat, and I like having the lyrics present, but they
don’t feel distracting because the vocals are rough. I also need to be
physically comfortable, but this doesn’t necessarily mean I need to be
in an armchair in a library. I like cafes, and often work from them, but
I can’t write while sitting in a cafe unless it’s during a quieter time
of the day and the cafe doesn’t play pop music loudly for ambiance. I
can write whilst sitting on a park bench, even if the bench isn’t like a
sofa, but maybe there aren’t many people around and the weather is
pleasant. I can write from my phone on public transport, as long as I
have a long enough journey and am seated by the window.
</p>
<p>
Oddly enough, I’ve found that I can write better and am more forced to
focus during periods of being “in transit”, like sitting in an airport
lounge, being on a long-distance ferry, or waiting at a cafe for a
friend to arrive because I’m early for our date. It might be because
there is a definite end to the time I’m in that place—compared to
sitting at home with an entire afternoon ahead of me and falling into
procrastination. It is entirely possible that the “forced deadline”
created by being in those temporary situations is beneficial for me
because of my neurodivergent brain. If I’m at home, I just won’t make a
deadline to write a post by, but in some of the scenarios I described, I
have no choice.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I register most of my domains with NameCheap (I have one on
<a href="https://name.com/">Name.com</a>). Before I could afford to pay
for my own hosting, I had a friend who set me up on her shared hosting.
I bought my own plan at NameCheap after about a decade of her generously
letting me use some of her space for free.
</p>
<p>
I use self-hosted WordPress. I take pride in the fact that I’ve coded my
theme myself—it’s not compatible with new features of WordPress and I
don’t try to make it that way, as it’s mostly just an outlet for my
coding creativity. I remember the days when I had the time, inspiration,
and energy to code and update a new theme every two weeks. If I remember
correctly, my current theme has been there since 2018, which is a
personal record for me. I’m not sure what changed (apart from the
obvious, like having more responsibilities in life and already doing
coding as part of my day job, etc.). I think I just focused more on the
idea of “branding” and simplicity, and that led me to build something
that I was happy with long-term.
</p>
<p>
I know WordPress has an interesting (if not slightly poor) reputation,
but I’ve just used it ever since I had my own domain name in the late
00’s, and I decided to stick with it. I’ve had many conversations with
friends about why I never converted to a static site generator, or why I
don’t do it now. I put too much emphasis on comments and having a
comments section, and didn’t want them to be owned by a third-party
service. A friend even joked that he’d build something custom for me,
but my needs made him give up. Hahah. I have well over 1,500 blog posts
and 26,000 comments. The thought of migrating them was not only a tricky
problem to solve, but at some point converting them made the possibility
of a sunk cost fallacy inevitable. I debated just removing the comment
functionality entirely, given that most readers either don’t leave
comments, or reach out to me through email or social media to share
their thoughts. With the rise of social media-type trolling comments and
inauthentic AI-generated ones, perhaps this could be a reason to no
longer care about blog post comments…
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I’m not sure that I would do anything too differently, because I’ve
owned a blog for so long and the things I would do differently have
already been applied, or weren’t too hard to change on an existing blog.
For example, the renaming of my blog from Heartdrops to Hey Georgie was
pretty straightforward.
</p>
<p>
If you asked me to start fresh today, perhaps I really would abandon the
whole comment thing—hahaha—and then use it as an opportunity to use
something that will let me write blog posts more “simply” with Markdown.
That’s probably all I’d really change. These days it’s not uncommon for
a blog to have no comments section, but it was just such a huge part of
me making friends and connections on the internet pre-social media.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
In a year, for domain and hosting, I pay about $80–100 AUD, give or
take. The .nu domain is notoriously expensive and costs some $40 a year,
but I committed to that when I first got it. Haha. (It’s kind of like
the custom licence plate I have for my car; I committed to that several
hundred dollar annual payment when I got it, so I keep paying for it
because it has sentimental value.) I don’t pay much attention to the
actual cost. I just pay for it when it’s due. Even though my frequency
of posts don’t suggest this, my blog is my passion project and something
I really care about.
</p>
<p>
I feel very strongly about monetising content in relation to being my
authentic self online. The topic first came up for me a while ago, long
before social media and living in a world of subscriptions and content
creation and ads and things. I first dabbled in sponsored posts and
accepting money for links when I only had a job for six hours a week,
because I just wanted extra cash. I felt uncomfortable about it though,
and I realised that my personal morals were important to me. All my
friends were telling me that I should make money from my online space,
but it didn’t sound like something I wanted to do. I put a PayPal donate
button on my blog and I felt gross, especially after I managed to get
more part time jobs. My blog was an outlet for my writing and a place
where I put my honest and personal thoughts. It was not a business.
</p>
<p>
I decided that my blog would always be a space that genuinely represents
myself and the things I care about and stand for. I previously accepted
payment for certain types of advertisements that I might not agree with
today. These days, I accept payment for in-post advertising, and free
products in return for honest reviews, but they must be from businesses
or companies whose principles I support, or whose products I might
actually use.
</p>
<p>
If other people choose to monetise their blog, I think they have every
right to do so. But I will admit that it’s sometimes funny to see
advertisements completely unrelated to the blog’s general content. It
only bothers me if someone’s blog is littered with ads and content that
they obviously paid for. But then I think we are getting into “content
creation” territory, which I consider different from people’s personal
blogs.
</p>
<p>
I don’t usually financially support other bloggers. If they have some
kind of “buy me a coffee” link, I might buy them a few coffees but it’ll
be a once-off. If I get to meet any other bloggers in real life, I am
more than happy to buy them a coffee in person. 😊
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
My good friend Pauline at
<a href="https://pawlean.com/">pawlean.com</a>, my friend Jane from
<a href="https://lemonandlively.com/">lemonandlively.com</a>, Ruben at
<a href="https://rubenerd.com/">rubenerd.com</a>, Jem at
<a href="https://jemjabella.co.uk/">jemjabella.co.uk</a>. 💙 I’m sure
least one of them might be up for an interview, but I’d gladly read an
interview with any of them.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
If you’ve read this far, just, thank you. I think there might be some
people reading this who know me from when I was literally fifteen years
old, too, which is not only astonishing, but really touching to me that
there was something about my writing or about me as a person that made
you read my blog in the first place. I’ve always liked writing, and
unlike other interests and hobbies, it’s a thing that innately stays
with you over time.
</p>
<p>
I have a podcast called
<a href="https://toast-and-roast.simplecast.com/">Toast &amp; Roast</a>,
a super low budget pod that my friend and I record for fun. It was a
mid-pandemic project that has been going for several years, and I think
the success of its tenure is to do with the fact that our recording
sessions are also the time we chat and catch up. We release episodes
weekly. It’s got the same unfiltered vibe that my blog posts have, and
we don’t really plan topics. Hopefully we’re the kind of pod you might
have playing in the background or just listen to when you don’t feel
like paying too much attention. I like to think it’s like eavesdropping
on two friends who are just talking shit. But if you’ve ever wanted to
put a voice to my face or writing, or whatever… hehe.
</p>
<p>
You can find me on Instagram at
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hey.georgie/"><span class="citation"
data-cites="hey.georgie">@hey.georgie</span></a>, where I mostly post
outfits and travel pictures. It’s ended up being the platform I use most
to interact with internet folk. I joined back when filters were part of
the aesthetic, and I think you couldn’t even write a caption? Instagram
has continued to be a good way to see what my friends are up to and to
message them casually. I was also an early adopter of Twitter and got a
lot of value out of it, but it’s no longer the platform it once was.
However, you can find me on
<a href="https://aus.social/@heygeorgie">Mastodon</a> where I don’t mind
posting silly thoughts and banter.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2020, in the early months of the pandemic, I published a poetry
collection called “<a href="https://hey.georgie.nu/tosib/">the off
switch is broken</a>”, inspired by my experience as a software engineer,
growing up on the internet, and what identity means online. It has
themes of discomfort and failure, as well as nostalgia and triumph.
Although there are pieces of poetry in the depths of my blog, this was
something I created with a lot more intent. I hope you consider taking a
look, as I think it documents feelings that we all share.

<h2 id="more-curl-help">more curl help</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Daniel Stenberg Blog</p>
<p>With the ever-growing number of command line options for curl, the
problem of how to provide documentation and help users understand how
options work and should be used is a challenge that is worth revisiting
regularly. To keep iterating on. I personally often use the curl manpage
to lookup descriptions for options. Often not only …

<h2 id="man-pages">2024-08-08 Man pages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-08-man-pages">
2024-08-08 Man pages
</h1>
<p>
Here’s a great thing on the command line. You want to use the command
<strong>foo</strong> and don’t know how, so you run <strong>man
foo</strong> and read the manual page. Sometimes there will be more info
in different “sections”. Commands are in section 1, which is why
documentation would sometimes refer to the command “foo” as
<strong>foo(1)</strong> because <strong>foo(5)</strong> might document
the file format or the config file that goes along with the command.
</p>
<p>
If that’s news to you, run <strong>man man</strong>. And if you find the
structure bewildering, read the manual on how to write manual pages:
<strong>man man-pages</strong> (section 7).
</p>
<p>
I’ve embraced man pages because when I write Perl code, I can put
documentation into the script such that when the script is installed, it
automatically works as its own man page – this works for
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-jupiter">jupiter</a>,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-BookmarkFeed">bookmark-feed</a> –
it also works for bigger projects, like
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-Phoebe">phoebe</a> where each
extension is also a Perl module and therefore also gets its own man
page.
</p>
<p>
For programming languages where the documentation is more focused on
documenting the code, things are different. Of course, there’s
<code>pydoc</code> for Python code and <code>go doc</code> for Go code,
but it’s not great. The list of variables and functions are maybe
suitable for libraries, but not for applications.
</p>
<p>
Since I don’t enjoy writing man pages directly (<code>man</code> is
actually a macro package for the <code>nroff</code> language, see
<strong>man nroff</strong>, obviously) I write my documentation in the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ddevault/scdoc">scdoc</a> format.
<a class="account" href="https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault" title="@drewdevault@fosstodon.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="drewdevault">@drewdevault</span></a> wrote
it <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/05/13/scdoc.html">in 2018</a>.
It looks a bit like Markdown and friends and I like it. I even put a
little sequence of <code>sed</code> expressions into a Makefile to turn
scdoc into Markdown so that I could publish the man pages on this site,
see <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ man pages</a>.
</p>
<p>
When documentation for a project is a website, I wonder how they serve
people offline or with bad connections. Perhaps they want to write the
documentation in texinfo? I haven’t done that in a long time but I
really enjoy reading a well-written manual like that. And you can get a
PDF for free but I’m not sure anybody really wants that. Even a README
is bad because in those rare cases where the program gets added to a
distro, how will end-users find the README? Man pages are the answer.
</p>
<p>
README files and offline copies of the HTML documentation have multiple
problems.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Which directory is it, exactly? <code>/usr/doc</code> does not exist on
my system. <code>/usr/share</code> lists lots of package names but these
are not the docs. <code>/usr/share/doc</code> is the one! But the
problems continue. Which is the file that you want to read when you’re
faced with <code>BUGS changelog.Debian.gz changelog.gz copyright README
README.Debian README.frames RELEASE-NOTES.txt WhatsNew.gz</code> – it’s
README, I guess, but I am always confused. Sometimes you’re looking at
binary and it’s also not obvious what the package name would be.
<code>find</code> is in <code>/usr/share/doc/findutils</code>, for
example.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Compared to this, man pages are so much better.
</p>
<p>
And some package managers like <code>go</code>, <code>pip</code>
(Python), <code>cabal</code> (Haskell) and <code>cargo</code> (Rust)
don’t install any of these files, I think.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that many developers consider using a website like
<a href="https://about.readthedocs.com/">Read the Docs</a> to be good
enough. Bad luck for people who are offline or who have bad reception,
in hotel rooms with bad wifi, in planes? My sister lives in the Rhine
valley, on the German side, close to Switzerland, in a tiny village of a
bit more than 100 people. They have no glass fibre. They have bad
reception, both from Switzerland and from Germany. It’s terrible! But
even for me: I have wifi in the apartment and glass windows that act
that block the signal. I have no reception on the balcony unless I use
my phone as a hotspot.
</p>
<p>
Local documentation that is easy to find is so much better.
</p>
<p>
And man pages are powerful. <em>All</em> of Perl is documented in many
pages. All the modules. All the switches. All the language features. I
learned to program in Perl from man pages back when my browser was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a>. (I
am a bit astonished to find that I still knew that acronym! But I didn’t
know that it stands for National Center for Supercomputing
Applications.) Anyway, what I wanted to say is that man pages can be
used to document large and complex things. From the command line, they
are readily accessible. With the right man reader, they can act as a
hypertext, linking to other pages. They don’t have to be terse and
cryptic, either. Man pages can be tutorials, introductions, FAQs, and
more. And if you write man pages using a suitable format, you can still
generate HTML pages with links.
</p>
<p>
If you’re not writing man pages, if your community doesn’t have the
habit of writing man pages, start small. Get <code>scdoc</code> and
write a little something. Skim <strong>man man-pages</strong> and learn
about the conventions, then write some text files. Then use <code>scdoc
&lt; text-file &gt; man-page</code> to create the file and install them
into <code>~/.local/share/man</code>, following the conventions. A page
from section 1 (commands) has the extension “.1” and goes into
<code>~/.local/share/man/man1</code> whereas a page from section 5 (file
formats and config files) has the extension “.5” and goes into
<code>~/.local/share/man/man5</code>.

<strong>2024-08-09</strong>. At one point I was interested in
<a href="2018-03-05_Troff">using troff as an alternative to LaTeX</a>,
so not to write documentation but to create PDFs, and I kept eyeing the
<a href="http://www.schaffter.ca/mom/mom-01.html">mom macros</a>. But
before I could give them a try I discovered how to
<a href="2020-07-24_Writing_Markdown,_generating_PDF">create PDFs using
Markdown to HTML to PDF</a> via weasyprint and that has been my workflow
ever since. For a zine I’m contributing to, however, I’m using
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/">groff</a> and the
<a href="https://www.troff.org/using-ms.pdf">ms macros</a> because
that’s what’s in the Makefile…
</p>
<p>
The reason I write this all up is that flexibeast wrote in, saying that
man pages can be written using the semantics-oriented
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc macros</a> instead of the
presentation-oriented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.7">man
macros</a> – and they had written an
<a href="https://github.com/flexibeast/guides/blob/master/mdoc-quickstart.md">mdoc
quickstart guide</a>. Nice!
</p>
<p>
I really have to take a look at
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc</a> as a groff
alternative.

California wildfire chews through timber in very hot and dry
weather</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICO, California — California’s largest wildfire so far this year
continued to grow Thursday as it chewed through timber in very hot and
dry weather.</p>
<p>The Park Fire has scorched more than 1,709 square kilometers since
erupting July 24 near the Sacramento Valley city of Chico and burning
northward up the western flank of the Sierra Nevada. Containment
remained at 34%, Cal Fire said.</p>
<p>The conflagration’s early explosive growth quickly made it
California’s fourth-largest wildfire on record before favorable weather
reduced its intensity late last week. It reawakened this week due to the
heat and very low relative humidity levels.</p>
<p>A large portion of the burned area was in mop-up stage but spot fires
were a continuing problem, officials said during Thursday morning’s
operational briefing.</p>
<p>The fire’s northeast corner was the top firefighting priority,
operations deputy Jed Gaines said.</p>
<p>“It’s not time to celebrate,” he said. “We got several more days of
hard work to hold what we got in there.”</p>
<p>The latest Park Fire assessments found 636 structures destroyed and
49 damaged. A local man was arrested after authorities alleged he
started the fire by pushing a burning car into a gully in a wilderness
park outside Chico.</p>
<p>About 160 kilometers to the south, a new forest fire in El Dorado
County was exhibiting extreme behavior, and some Park Fire aircraft were
being diverted there.</p>
<p>The Crozier Fire, about 16 kilometers north of Placerville, had
burned more than 5.17 square kilometers of timber and chaparral as of
Thursday evening and was just 5% contained. The fire threatens 1,625
structures, according to Cal Fire.</p>

panda habitat opens at California zoo to much fanfare</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>san diego, california — Two Chinese giant pandas are now California
residents as their enclosure at the San Diego Zoo opened to the public
on Thursday in an international ceremony. </p>
<p>The pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, are the first to enter the United
States in 21 years and were welcomed by California Governor Gavin Newsom
and the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng.  </p>
<p>Yun Chuan, a 5-year-old male, is easily recognized by his long,
slightly pointed nose, while Xin Bao is a 4-year-old female with big
fluffy ears whose name means a “precious treasure of prosperity and
abundance.” </p>
<p>Yun Chuan’s name means “big river of cloud.” His mother, Zhen Zhen,
was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. </p>
<p>The zoo is working closely with Chinese experts to help with the
adaptation period and understanding of the needs of the two pandas. The
pair are enjoying a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of
“wotou,” a traditional Chinese steamed cornbread that’s also called
“panda bread.” </p>
<p>“The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as we celebrate the 45th
anniversary of our diplomatic ties, has sent a clear and important
message,” said Xie.  </p>
<p>“China-U.S. cooperation on panda conservation will not cease. Our
people-to- people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop,
and once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut
again,” he added. </p>
<p>Newsom said the new pandas were about “celebrating our common
humanity. It’s about celebrating the things that bind us together.” </p>
<p>“And so, for me, this spirit of pride that is associated with this
opening today with the experience that so many will have, that we just
had at Panda Ridge, is about a deeper meaning,” Newsom added. </p>
<p>Visitors of all ages to Panda Ridge on Thursday were exuberant about
the pandas’ cuteness. </p>
<p>“I have never seen a panda before. I’ve only seen them on TV and
nature documentaries,” said Kobi Davis from Michigan. “They are super
cute. They just kind of laze around, you know. There’s charm in that.”
 </p>
<p>Keena Butcher from Canada called them “quiet, thoughtful creatures,
and just realize we can have hope for our future if we can conserve
them.”  </p>
<p>China’s Communist government has long used “panda diplomacy” to
enhance the country’s soft power, lending the large but cuddly looking
black-and-white bears to zoos in various countries over the decades as
goodwill animal ambassadors. </p>
<p>In late 2023, Washington’s National Zoo said goodbye to its beloved
giant pandas, which were returned to China amid heightened tensions
between the two global superpowers. </p>
<p>In May this year, the National Zoo said China would send two young
pandas to Washington by the end of the year.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Why don’t we build things?
</p>
<p>
Yale Law School professor David Schleicher, who studies local government
and land use, has been trying to answer this question for years. While
Schleicher typically writes about housing, his latest work — an essay
literally called
“<a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f6103f36b5eee6bf0ab2c1d/t/66b2940a3d75643360f4494a/1722979338415/17.3_Schleicher_Why+Can%27t+We+Build.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Why
Can’t We Build?</u></a>” for the <em><em>New York University Journal of
Law and Liberty</em></em> — is useful for thinking about why we don’t
have as much green energy infrastructure as we need<strong>.
</strong>“Despite a generation of low interest rates and innovation in
many non-physical realms,” he writes, “there are few physical monuments
that we will pass to future generations — where are today’s Brooklyn
Bridges or Hoover Dams?”
</p>
<p>
There are certainly <em>explanations</em> for this lack of
infrastructural boldness. But more importantly, what are the
<em>reasons<strong></strong></em> for it?<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong>The explanations are often local restrictions on
growth. When it comes to housing, that might mean zoning regulations
that limit what kind of structures can be built where or fees that are
sometimes charged to multifamily units. For renewable energy, developers
of wind and solar might find themselves coming up against noise
restrictions, rules that essentially require
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2023/news-release-nrel-analysis-quantifies-impacts-of-setback-ordinances-on-land-available-for-renewable-energy-deployment.html" target="_blank">minimum
amounts of land for installations</a>, or even
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2024/02/27/renewable-energy-sources-ban-map/72630315007/#:~:text=Statewide%20blocks%20and%20limits%20put,energy%20by%202035%20at%20risk&text=A%20nationwide%20analysis%20by%20USA,than%20they're%20building%20it." target="_blank"><u>outright
bans on certain types of generation</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But that doesn’t explain why these rules exist — the reasons why
infrastructure doesn’t get built. As for these, he told me, most of them
come down to the structural factors of local politics. “Statewide
majorities have policy preferences” that often support development,
Schleicher said. But local a body of government institutions that have
been built up since the 1970s “have limited the capacity of those stated
statewide preferences to be reflected in policy in many places.”
</p>
<p>
When it comes to zoning, Schleicher told me, proponents of reform “make
arguments at the local level, but they’re very simply turning to the
state level because the issue is larger than any individual
jurisdiction.” The same goes for renewable energy.
</p>
<p>
If you ask people across an entire state if they want more housing or
renewable energy, they will likely say yes. But local elections — which
typically have comparatively low participation and are more likely to be
decided on national party lines than on local policy issues — rarely
reflect this political reality. With a lack of direct checks from the
electorate, interest and advocacy groups have outsize weight on local
policymaking.
</p>
<p>
Local governments have a variety of structures meant to discourage
growth and systematically prioritize the views of those with the time
and inclination to show up to local meetings — not just those who show
up to vote every two or four years. Decisionmaking on individual
projects may be dominated by homeowners or local environmental groups
that don’t want to see any building or change in the built environment.
</p>
<p>
Statewide policymaking, on the other hand, “can bring different interest
groups to the fore,” Schleicher told me, including labor and large
employers. When Michigan, for instance, passed a suite of clean energy
bills in 2023 with support from labor, it allowed the state to take over
permitting for large clean energy projects
<a href="https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/climatechange/2024/08/07/michigans-new-siting-process-gives-some-authority-to-state-regulators-but-under-what-circumstances/" target="_blank">if
the applicable local rules are too restrictive</a>.
</p>
<p>
California, too, has passed a series of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/make-or-break-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>laws</u></a>
centralizing
<a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/topics/power-plants/opt-certification-program" target="_blank">renewable
energy permitting</a> and limiting the appeals that advocacy groups can
make to block projects, which Governor Gavin Newsom has already
<a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/02/09/governor-newsom-streamlines-riverside-energy-project-set-to-provide-clean-power-for-650000-homes/#:~:text=This%20key%20tool%20to%20cut,legal%20challenges%20to%20be%20heard." target="_blank">put
to work</a>. Earlier this year, he essentially fast-tracked a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/make-or-break-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>400
megawatt solar project in Riverside County</u></a> by giving opponents
<a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/environment/2024/02/09/newsom-limits-appeals-of-controversial-desert-solar-project/72540440007/" target="_blank">just
nine months</a> to petition against its approval.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>In all likelihood, however, Michigan will have to pass more
new laws and regulations to speed up renewable development in any
meaningful way. “Realistically, one of the other things that the zoning
story has taught us that may be relevant for clean energy is that it’s
almost never does one law do the trick,” Schleicher told me. When states
<em>have</em> tried to boost housing production, he pointed out, it has
often required several rounds of legislation to get a meaningful boost
in production as local opponents of new housing adapt to new laws.
</p>
<p>
California<strong>,</strong> again, provides a helpful example. The
state is in the midst of a massive building boom in so-called accessory
dwelling units, a.k.a. “granny flats” or ADUs. Housing advocates in the
state credit this not just to
<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/accessory-dwelling-units-adus-in-california/" target="_blank"><u>a
set of bills passed in 2016</u></a> preempting certain local regulations
including setbacks, some parking requirements, and fees for utility
connections that discouraged their construction, but also to
<a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/accessory-dwelling-units-adus-in-california/" target="_blank">11
more bills</a> passed by 2022, methodically clearing out local
restrictions on building, renting, and selling ADUs.
</p>
<p>
And this was just the latest chapter in the effort to encourage the
building of ADUs — the first bill trying to get around local bans in
California
<a href="https://furmancenter.org/files/Evaluating_California%E2%80%99s_Accessory_Dwelling_Unit_Reforms_508.pdf" target="_blank"><u>passed
in 1982</u></a>. Forty years later, however, there were still only 1,000
permitted ADUs in the whole state. As of 2022, the state had registered
82,000 ADUs, a fifth of all housing produced in the state that year,
<a href="https://cayimby.org/reports/california-adu-reform-a-retrospective/" target="_blank"><u>according
to CA YIMBY, a housing advocacy group</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“The first couple times statewide ADU bills were passed, local
governments would come up with other ways to stop things,” Schleicher
said.
</p>
<p>
Something similar has and likely will continue to happen as states try
to wrest siting for renewables projects from local governments. In New
York, a 1972 law the governing the siting of power plants has gone
through many different iterations. This law, known as Article 10, was
changed in 2010 to apply to smaller generators and therefore include
renewables projects. Article 10 created a “siting board” that could
permit renewables projects under a fast-track process that exempted them
from environmental impact statements required by the State Environmental
Quality Review Act. The Board would even be allowed to waive
“unreasonably burdensome” local laws restricting renewables development.
</p>
<p>
But the new process did little to speed permitting. What was intended to
be a one- to two-year process instead turned “more lengthy and
challenging than originally anticipated,”
<a href="https://renewable-energy.mit.edu/blog/research-report-state-preemption" target="_blank"><u>according
to</u></a> Massachusetts Institute of Technology researchers Lawrence
Susskind and Anushree Chaudari. By 2018, Columbia University professor
Michael Gerrard and then Arnold &amp; Porter partner Edward McTiernan
<a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/docs/Michael%20Gerrard/070051815-Arnold.pdf" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a>,
a single project had been approved under the new system.
</p>
<p>
New York passed a new law in 2020, which included fixed timelines for
review. The new process, while relatively new, has managed to get some
local rules on renewable siting
<a href="https://pragmaticenvironmentalistofnewyork.blog/2021/06/17/ny-office-of-renewable-energy-siting-heritage-wind-decision/" target="_blank"><u>thrown
out as</u></a> “unreasonably burdensome,” and

<a href="https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/local-news/rush-residents-share-thoughts-on-horseshoe-solar-project/" target="_blank"><u>have
lost out</u></a> in front of the new siting board.
</p>
<p>
As
<a href="https://cbs6albany.com/news/local/ny-not-on-track-to-meet-extraordinarily-ambitious-climate-goals-report-shows-new-york-governor-kathy-hochul-emissions-clcpa-bloomberg-new-york-state-electricity-renewable-resources" target="_blank">New
York state struggles</a> to meet its ambitious goals for
decarbonization, it will likely need to reform land use and permitting
regulations again, and again, and again, along with every other state.
</p>
<p>
“Remember that you’re in a long fight instead of a short one,”
Schleicher told me. “One of the most important things is to be able to
pass successive bills because local opponents to statewide efforts are
going to adapt and change and respond.”

<h2 id="us-stock-markets-rally-sp-500-sees-best-day-since-2022">US stock
markets rally; S&amp;P 500 sees best day since 2022</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — U.S. stocks rallied Thursday in Wall Street’s latest sharp
swerve after a better-than-expected report on unemployment eased worries
about a slowing economy. </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 jumped 2.3% for its best day since 2022 and shaved
off all but 0.5% of its loss from what was a brutal start to the week.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 683 points, or 1.8%, and the
Nasdaq composite climbed 2.9% as Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks helped
lead the way. </p>
<p>Treasury yields also climbed in the bond market in a signal that
investors are feeling less worried about the economy after a report
showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week.
The number was better than economists expected. </p>
<p>It was exactly a week ago that worse-than-expected data on
unemployment claims helped enflame worries that the Federal Reserve has
kept interest rates too high for too long in order to beat inflation.
That helped send markets reeling worldwide, along with a rate hike by
the Bank of Japan that sent shockwaves worldwide by scrambling a
favorite trade among some hedge funds. </p>
<p>At the worst of it, at least so far, the S&amp;P 500 was down nearly
10% from its all-time high set last month. Such drops are regular
occurrences on Wall Street, and corrections of 10% happen roughly every
year or two. After Thursday’s jump, the index is back within about 6% of
its record. </p>
<p>What made this decline particularly scary was how quickly it
happened. A measure of how much investors are paying to protect
themselves from future drops for the S&amp;P 500 briefly surged toward
its highest level since the COVID crash of 2020. </p>
<p>Still, the market’s swings look more like a “positioning-driven
crash” caused by too many investors piling into similar trades and then
exiting them together, rather than the start of a long-term downward
market caused by a recession, according to strategists at BNP
Paribas.</p>

id="five-arrested-over-attack-that-wounded-us-troops-in-iraq-air-base-statement-says">Five
arrested over attack that wounded US troops in Iraq air base, statement
says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAIRO — Security forces have arrested five people in connection with
an attack this week at a military base in Iraq in which five U.S. troops
and two U.S. contractors were wounded, Iraqi officials said on
Thursday. </p>
<p>The arrests were announced by the Iraqi Security Media Cell, an
official body responsible for disseminating security information. </p>
<p>“After in-depth legal investigations and listening to witnesses’
statements … five of those involved in this illegal act were arrested,”
the Security Media Cell added in a statement. </p>
<p>In Monday’s attack, two Katyusha rockets were fired at Ain al-Asad
air base in the west of the country. On Tuesday, Iraq’s military
condemned what it called “reckless” actions against bases on its soil
and said it had captured a truck with a rocket launcher. </p>
<p>The attack came as the Middle East braced for a possible new wave of
attacks by Iran and its allies following last week’s killing of senior
members of militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. </p>
<p>It was unclear whether the incident in Iraq was linked to threats by
Iran to retaliate over the killing in Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail
Haniyeh. </p>
<p>Iraq is a rare ally of both the U.S. and Iran. It hosts 2,500 U.S.
troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces. It
has witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war
erupted in Gaza in October. </p>
<p>Iraq wants troops from the U.S.-led military coalition to begin
withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition’s work by
September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some U.S. forces likely to
remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.</p>

id="after-recent-challenges-us-looks-to-rethink-africom-aid-initiatives">After
recent challenges, US looks to rethink AFRICOM, aid initiatives</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Wednesday completed one of the last
major troop departures from Niger ahead of the military junta-imposed
September 15 deadline. About 1,000 troops were stationed in Niger before
the ruling leadership’s order to leave.</p>
<p>A joint statement from the Nigerien Defense Ministry and the U.S.
military said personnel and equipment from the base had been withdrawn
and coordination would continue over the coming weeks to make sure the
pullout is complete.</p>
<p>“The effective cooperation and communication between the U.S. and
Nigerien armed forces ensured that this turnover was completed ahead of
schedule and without complications.”</p>
<p>In an interview with VOA’s Anthony LaBruto, U.S. Representative
Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives
Foreign Affairs Committee, details how the United States is reevaluating
its military presence in light of the troop departures as well as recent
challenges to its broader security initiatives on the continent.</p>
<p>The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: What role does the United States Africa Command, or AFRICOM,
play in the continent? In what capacity do AFRICOM’s teams serve in
different countries in Africa and how is it helping to stabilize
democracy?</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Michael McCaul: I just met with AFRICOM. I had a
briefing from them. So, this is a very timely interview. They’re
primarily military. That’s why in 2019, I introduced the Global
Fragility Act. … And to your point, it forces [AFRICOM] to go beyond
just being a military organization. It forces them to coordinate with
states and with the United States Agency for International Development
together on the African continent, and that’s very helpful if they’re
working together rather than independently with their own missions. When
I was at AFRICOM, they talked about it a lot, how that bill has really
changed the way they operate.</p>
<p>VOA: I noticed that when the head of Africa Command testified before
your committee, he mentioned that military presence in Africa should go
alongside diplomatic and aid efforts on the continent. Can you elaborate
on how these different elements are coordinated and their overall impact
on the region?</p>
<p>McCaul: Look, the military is important. But that’s not going to win
this alone, right? I mean, when you have economic ties, they strengthen
our alliances and that’s where I think the U.S. International
Development Finance Corporation can be helpful.</p>
<p>And then of course USAID, you know, we provide our humanitarian
assistance. I passed the branding bill, which requires the American flag
to be on this, so that they know where the aid is coming from, because
prior to that, they didn’t know where it’s coming from. Now, if China
brings in the [diplomatic] systems, their flags are everywhere and so
now USAID has the American flag. They know where it’s coming from. That
really helps in diplomacy.</p>
<p>I would also throw trade in there. If we could get back to having
some trade agreements, which we haven’t done, quite frankly, under this
administration. Of course, the military we need. They provide the
security umbrella to provide the soft power — that being diplomatic and
economic assistance.</p>
<p>VOA: What are the U.S. military’s strategies for countering threats
in countries like Somalia and Kenya, and how do these efforts support
and integrate with aid projects in the region?</p>
<p>McCaul: We have counterterrorism operations — that’s where AFRICOM
comes in — but they’re overstretched and overburdened. Their role in
coordinating with the State Department and USAID is to provide that
security piece. … But when you have Niger kicking us out, there’s
nothing we can do. We can’t operate within countries.</p>
<p>You look at Somalia, I mean our presence there is … quite frankly,
that embassy is so dangerous you can’t even drive to it, you have to fly
in. That’s probably the most dangerous embassy in the world right now.
And now, with the events of the Houthi rebels joining forces with
al-Shabab, it’s even worse. I really worry about that embassy. … They
have a lot of security there, and it’s probably the most secure embassy
in the world, but still. I mean, what good is that presence if you can’t
really operate out of the country?</p>
<p>VOA: With the military or AFRICOM being challenged so much, is the
U.S. rethinking any of its military or aid policies on the
continent?</p>
<p>McCaul: They are [being challenged], and it’s a resource issue; it’s
a big continent. There’s not much we can do if the country doesn’t want
us there. They kicked the French out of Mali, in the Sahel regions,
they’re gone.</p>
<p>They have this anti-colonialism attitude that goes back to the
French, and I understand that, and they probably look at us [similarly]
in some respects. We want them to look at us as a liberator, not an
occupier, but they do have a sense of, ‘Oh, the colonials are coming
back in,’ certainly with the French, probably less so with the
Americans, but we still have that issue.</p>
<p>The AFRICOM General [Michael] Langley warned that the loss of U.S.
bases in the Sahel will “degrade our ability to do active watching and
warning, including for the homeland defense.” Right now, the terrorist
organizations in Africa are more focused on Africa and not external
operations, but we always have to be mindful of that, that any of these
terror operations can go operational, external operations, if that’s the
direction they want to go. Right now, I’m not sure they have that
capacity to conduct external operations necessarily over here, but it’s
something we have to continue to watch.</p>
<p>This Q&amp;A originated in VOA’s English to Africa Service.</p>

The

Raspberry Pi Pico 2</a> was announced today, with a new chip, the
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2350/">RP2350</a>. This
silicon improves on almost every aspect of the RP2040:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
3 PIOs instead of 2
</li>
<li>
150 MHz instead of 133 MHz base clock
</li>
<li>
Faster Arm Cortex M33 cores <em>and</em> RISC-V Hazard3 cores
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’ve had access to pre-release hardware and good news: even though the
new chip is faster and has more features, it actually uses <em>less</em>
power than RP2040, meaning if you run one of these things off a battery,
it’ll last longer.
</p>
<p>
I’ll talk more about power later, but first, here’s the specs.

undeterred despite US action to protect Red Sea shipping</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S.-led efforts to thwart attacks on international
shipping by Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen are nothing more
than a “shock absorber” and are unlikely to lead to stability or safer
seas, according to a senior U.S. commander.</p>
<p>Vice Admiral George Wikoff, who heads the U.S. naval efforts in the
Middle East, shared the blunt assessment Wednesday, saying that not only
have U.S. strikes and defensive efforts done little to change the
Houthis’ behavior, it now appears unlikely the group will be swayed by
military force.</p>
<p>“The solution is not going to come at the end of a weapon system,”
Wikoff told an audience in Washington, speaking via video from U.S. 5th
Fleet headquarters in Bahrain.</p>
<p>“We have certainly degraded their capability. There’s no doubt about
that. We’ve degraded their ability,” he said. “However, have we stopped
them? No.”</p>
<p>The comments build on other U.S. assessments that have questioned the
ability of the United States and its allies to stop the Houthis from
targeting commercial ships transiting the Red Sea, which account for up
to 15% of international maritime trade.</p>
<p>An unclassified report issued this past June by the U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency, or DIA, found container shipping in the region
plunged by 90% from December 2023 through mid-February 2024.</p>
<p>It also warned that despite U.S. and European countermeasures, such
as the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian and the European Union’s
ASPIDES mission, the Houthis still carried out more than 43 attacks
between November 19 and March 23, driving up security costs and
insurance premiums.</p>
<p>Wikoff on Wednesday said U.S. forces have seen some signs of
stabilization since February but called it an “unacceptable
stabilization,” with the number of ships crossing the Bab el Mandeb
Strait, which connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden, still down by
about half.</p>
<p>Yet the attacks and threats to commercial shipping and U.S. forces in
the region persist.</p>
<p>Houthi officials Wednesday claimed they launched attacks on a
container ship and on two U.S. military vessels, although a U.S. defense
official told VOA there was no “operational reporting to support those
claims.”</p>
<p>Separately, U.S. Central Command, which oversees American troops in
the Middle East, has said its forces have destroyed seven Houthi aerial
drones, seven Houthi missiles, one Houthi naval drone and one Houthi
missile launcher, all in the past five days.</p>
<p>“It’s a struggle we have every day to try to figure out where are we
on the meter with regards to stability in the region,” Wikoff said.</p>
<p>The Houthis have said their campaign in the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden is to show solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza amid the war
between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>But Wikoff pushed back against that notion, noting Houthi attacks on
shipping predate the war while describing the U.S.-designated terror
group as “a weapon looking for a reason to use it.”</p>
<p>And if the Houthis have anything they value enough that they do not
want to risk using it, the U.S. and its partners have yet to find
it.</p>
<p>“It’s very difficult to find a centralized center of gravity that we
can hold at risk over time and use that as a potential point of
deterrence,” Wikoff said. “So, trying to apply a classic deterrence
policy in this particular scenario is a bit challenging.”</p>
<p>It is an argument some experts have been making for months.</p>
<p>“We have very little leverage over the Houthis, and air strikes are
unlikely to deter them,” according to Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen
specialist at the University of Cambridge in Britain.</p>
<p>“They have a high tolerance for casualties, they are highly
adaptable, they do not need sophisticated weapons to wreak havoc, they
just need to keep going — not losing is winning, and they believe they
have God on their side,” she told VOA via email. “In reality, air
strikes by the U.S. and U.K. benefit the Houthis by providing evidence
to back up their propaganda narratives against the U.S. and its
allies.”</p>
<p>But other experts, such as former British Ambassador to Yemen Edmund
Fitton-Brown, are more critical of the approach taken by the U.S. and
its allies in trying to degrade and dissuade the Houthi attacks.</p>
<p>The U.S.-led responses have been “meticulously proportionate,” said
Fitton-Brown, now a senior adviser for the New York and Berlin-based
Counter Extremism Project.</p>
<p>“We need to be more determined and creative about what to do about
this,” he said. “We are looking at a de facto authority, and a de facto
authority has fixed points you can attack.”</p>
<p>“They have military bases that were previously in the hands of the
government. They have intelligence headquarters. They have security
deployments in [the port city of] Hodeidah,” Fitton-Brown told VOA.
“Significant escalation of targeting is possible without changing the
legal status of the conflict.”</p>
<p>The U.S. vice admiral in charge of U.S. naval forces in the region,
however, is wary that military force will ultimately move the
Houthis.</p>
<p>“Our mission remains to disrupt their ability and try to preserve
some semblance of maritime order while we give an opportunity for policy
to be developed against the Houthis,” Wikoff said. “The more players in
the field that can get involved in a diplomatic piece of this, the
better off I think we’ll be.”</p>

<p>
To keep me and my brain running during working hours costs me
~$359.26/month. Not much to say beyond that –no grand epiphanies– except
that I think it’s too expensive. Sitting in an office by myself costs me
$16.33/day (or $2/hour). This budget doesn’t include breakfast, dinner,
exercise, healthcare, transit, internet, electricity, or office
supplies… all necessities that enable the work. This is just the daily
cost of caloric fuel to keep my body going during the nine-to-five. My
family has three other humans in it too, so this seems collossaly
expensive.
</p>
<p>
If I wanted to save money (I sort of do), here’s what I’d could try to
optimize from top to bottom:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I could make my own pre-made meals for about ~$2/meal. I’ve had success
with this but it requires a lot of weekend logistics to execute
properly. This would be the most significant cost reduction, costing
only $44/month and saving $176/month.
</li>
<li>
I could buy whey protein in bulk. A 5 lb bag of Muscle Milk (nearest
approximate flavor) is $72/bag and contains 68 servings for a reduced
costs of $1.05/serving. However, one serving only has 25g of protein, so
if I’d need to double the scoops. The total cost would then be
$2.11/serving or $46.42/month. Buying bulk powder makes fiscal sense,
but $30/month to not have to deal with drinking clumpy protein shakes
and washing crusted stinky shakers seems almost worth it.
</li>
<li>
I considered eggs as an alternate source of protein instead. A single
egg has ~6g of protein and costs about 50¢. The cost could potentially
come down but the bigger issue is to get the same 42g of protein I’d
need to eat 7 eggs. I don’t know if you’ve eaten eggs before but <u>7
eggs is a lot of eggs</u>. Imagine woofing down 7 sweaty hard-boiled
orbs a couple times a day, yikes.
</li>
<li>
I could brew my own agave-sweetened tea. I’ve done this once, but the
crisp flavor profile wasn’t the same so I wouldn’t call it a success.
Needs more experimentation.
</li>
<li>
Thanks to Costco selling our favorite local coffee roaster in bulk, we
have caffeine ritual costs dialed down about as low as they can go. Feel
comfortable there.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Lowering my lunch costs stands out as the best candidate for
improvement. But
<a href="https://daverupert.com/2023/10/snap-kitchen/">as I noted
before</a>, adding even a small pile of extra duties risks toppling the
wagon and I’m back to eating emergency $14 Spicy Chicken Sando Combos to
quench my hunger. I wonder where my daily costs fit on a graph of
national statistics. Is this average? Is this Bidenomic inflation? Am I
making myself poor with my avocado toast? Someone who understands
finances help me budget! Ack!

largest 3D-printed neighborhood nears completion in Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GEORGETOWN, Texas — As with any desktop 3D printer, the Vulcan
printer pipes layer by layer to build an object – except this printer is
more than 45 feet (13.7 m) wide, weighs 4.75 tons and prints residential
homes.</p>
<p>This summer, the robotic printer from ICON is finishing the last few
of 100 3D-printed houses in Wolf Ranch, a community in Georgetown,
Texas, about 30 miles from Austin.</p>
<p>ICON began printing the walls of what it says is the world’s largest
3D-printed community in November 2022. Compared to traditional
construction, the company says that 3D printing homes is faster, less
expensive, requires fewer workers, and minimizes construction material
waste.</p>
<p>“It brings a lot of efficiency to the trade market,” said ICON senior
project manager Conner Jenkins. “So, where there were maybe five
different crews coming in to build a wall system, we now have one crew
and one robot.”</p>
<p>After concrete powder, water, sand and other additives are mixed
together and pumped into the printer, a nozzle squeezes out the concrete
mixture like toothpaste onto a brush, building up layer by layer along a
pre-programmed path that creates corduroy-effect walls.</p>
<p>The single-story three- to four-bedroom homes take about three weeks
to finish printing, with the foundation and metal roofs installed
traditionally.</p>
<p>Jenkins said the concrete walls are designed to be resistant to
water, mold, termites and extreme weather.</p>
<p>Lawrence Nourzad, a 32-year-old business development director, and
his girlfriend Angela Hontas, a 29-year-old creative strategist,
purchased a Wolf Ranch home earlier this summer.</p>
<p>“It feels like a fortress,” Nourzad said, adding that he was
confident it would be resilient to most tornados.</p>
<p>The walls also provide strong insulation from the Texas heat, the
couple said, keeping the interior temperature cool even when the air
conditioner wasn’t on full blast.</p>
<p>There was one other thing the 3D-printed walls seemed to protect
against, however: a solid wireless internet connection.</p>
<p>“Obviously these are really strong, thick walls. And that’s what
provides a lot of value for us as homeowners and keeps this thing really
well-insulated in a Texas summer, but signal doesn’t transfer through
these walls very well,” Nourzad said.</p>
<p>To alleviate this issue, an ICON spokeswoman said most Wolf Ranch
homeowners use mesh internet routers, which broadcast a signal from
multiple units placed throughout a home, versus a traditional router
which sends a signal from one device.</p>
<p>The 3D-printed homes at Wolf Ranch, called the “Genesis Collection”
by developers, range in price from around $450,000 to close to $600,000.
Developers said a little more than one quarter of the 100 homes have
been sold.</p>
<p>ICON, which 3D-printed its first home in Austin in 2018, hopes to one
day take its technology to the Moon. NASA, as part of its Artemis Moon
exploration program, has contracted ICON to develop a construction
system capable of building landing pads, shelters, and other structures
on the lunar surface.</p>

<h2 id="no-the-news-is-not-information-junk-food">No, the news is not
information junk food</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
Every so often, a post goes around in tech circles about how news is bad
and we shouldn’t pay attention to it. I think that’s ludicrous.
</p>
<p>
Today’s was a post from 2022 called <a href="https://chuck.is/news/">The
News is Information Junk Food</a>. I think it’s a bad argument that
could have poor consequences.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41189946">It was featured
on Hacker News</a>, so, gods help me, I commented there.
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41191334">Here’s what I
said</a>:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<em>This is a pretty bad take.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>For example, multiple studies have shown that in communities that
aren’t addressed by a robust local news outlet, local corruption goes
up. Having a good newsroom does improve an understanding of what your
representatives are up to, and a lack of information does allow them to
get up to more behind our backs.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>I think the biggest failure of this piece is to make all news
equivalent. Yes, much cable news is junk; yes, many of the corporate
newsrooms that churn out hundreds of articles a day are junk. They use
engagement as a metric for success rather than finding ways to align
themselves with impact and creating an informed, empowered electorate.
That last thing - an informed, empowered electorate - is what it’s all
about.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Real journalism that is diligently undertaken in the public interest
does make a real difference. (Should we know whether Clarence Thomas was
taking corrupt bribes? Yes. Should we know how climate change is
progressing? Yes. Should we know if the police are killing innocent
people? Yes. Should we know that the police at the Uvalde school
shooting hung around for over an hour doing nothing? Yes.) Telling
people not to pay attention to the world around them results in an
electorate who cannot meaningfully vote on real issues.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>For those of us who build software, we need to know the factors that
impact the lives of the people we’re serving. We need to know the trends
in the marketplaces and communities where we show up. The news is good
for that, too.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Turn off cable news; pay more attention to non-profit news; go for
long-form written journalism. Stay informed.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>It’s absolutely true that we take a psychic hit for doing so. I’d
say that’s more to do with the world than it is the media overall.
Perhaps we should spend more time trying to make it better?</em>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
One user responded:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<em>The key is to focus on local news: these are updates that a person
can take action upon.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Seeing the latest tragedies on the other side of the world catches
headlines, but rarely actionable by regular people.</em>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
To which I replied:
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<em>We all have foreign policies. For example, in the US, our government
is heavily involved in Gaza and Ukraine. It’s far away, but it’s also
highly relevant to how our representatives work on our behalf.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>Should we give aid to other countries? How should we think about
global society? Those things are all relevant, too.</em>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
The bottom line to my argument: Journalism is a key to understanding the
world around us. We shouldn’t give ourselves excuses to look away.

<h2 id="apple-memory-holed-its-broken-promise-for-an-ocsp-opt-out">Apple
memory holed its broken promise for an OCSP opt-out</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>When you launch an app, macOS connects to Apple’s OCSP service to
check whether the app’s Developer ID code signing certificate has been
revoked by Apple. In November 2020, Apple’s OCSP service experienced a
mass outage, preventing Mac users worldwide from launching apps. In
response and remedy to this outage, Apple made several explicit promises
to Mac users in a support document, which can still be seen in a Wayback
Machine archive from September 24, 2023. ↫ Jeff Johnson One of the
explicit promises Apple made was that it would allow macOS users to turn
off phoning home to Cupertino every time you launch an application on
macOS. It’s four years later now, and this promise has not been kept –
Apple still does not allow you to turn off phoning home. In fact, it
turns out that last year, Apple scrubbed this promise from all of its
documentation, hoping we’re all going to forget about it. In other
words, Apple is never going to allow its macOS users to stop the
operating system from phoning home to Cupertino every time you launch an
application. Even though the boiling frog story is nonsensical, it’s apt
here. More and more Apple is limiting its users’ control over macOS,
locking it down to a point where you’re not really the owner of your
computer anymore. Stuff like this gives me the creeps.</p>

id="tropical-storm-debby-makes-2nd-landfall-in-south-carolina-heavy-rain-expected-up-the-east-coast">Tropical
Storm Debby makes 2nd landfall in South Carolina, heavy rain expected up
the East Coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HUGER, S.C. — Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in
South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far
north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend.</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday
near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving
inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up
through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.</p>
<p>Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on
the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum
sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).</p>
<p>Considerable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South
Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional
3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, as well as in
portions of Virginia, according to the hurricane center.</p>
<p>Days of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South
Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing
damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic
Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great
Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service’s office in Charleston
also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.</p>
<p>In Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston,
Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to
drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.</p>
<p>Taylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving
belongings out or up higher in his home. It’s a lesson learned the hard
way — Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had
floodwater in his home in the past nine years.</p>
<p>“To save everything, we’ve learned from the past it’s better be
prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,” Taylor
said.</p>
<p>A few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8
inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.</p>
<p>“Eight inches disrupts your whole life,” Grainger said. “You don’t
get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It’s part of living on the
creek.”</p>
<p>In Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in
Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a
briefing.</p>
<p>More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said
Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were
closed.</p>
<p>“We’ve been faced with a lot of things we’ve never been faced with
before,” Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. “I’m
78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in
Bulloch County. It’s amazing what has happened, and amazing what is
going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.”</p>
<p>For residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of
Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a
painful dose of déjà vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a
nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.</p>
<p>Located roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic
Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn’t seem
like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say

<p>Debby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great
Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm
strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong
thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott
Kleebauer.</p>
<p>“We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind
of scooted from Michigan eastward,” Kleebauer said.</p>
<p>As much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New
Jersey in less than four hours.</p>
<p>Emergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash
flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell
people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice.
Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.</p>
<p>About 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday
morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including
two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy’s
Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would
take days due to the damage.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just
entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were
damaged but roads and water systems were without significant
problems.</p>
<p>The final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in
North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>A state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and
Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that
coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.</p>
<p>At least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in

Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, company cancels plans for grain export
facility in historic Black town</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WALLACE, La. — Residents of a historic Black community in Louisiana
who’ve spent years fighting against a massive grain export facility set
to be built on the grounds where their enslaved ancestors once lived
appear to have finally halted the project.</p>
<p>A representative from the company, Greenfield Louisiana LLC,
announced during a public hearing on Tuesday evening that the company is
“ceasing all plans” to construct a grain export facility in the middle
of the town of Wallace in St. John the Baptist Parish.</p>
<p>After a moment, opponents of the project broke out in cheers and
began clapping and hugging each other.</p>
<p>“I’m still obviously in disbelief — I can’t believe this is
happening, but I’m ecstatic and all praise to the ancestors,” said Joy
Banner, a Wallace resident and one of the most vocal opponents of the
project. She and her sister, Jo, founded The Descendants Project to
preserve the community’s heritage.</p>
<p>The company’s announcement signaled a rare win for a community in a
heavily industrialized stretch of the Mississippi River known as “Cancer
Alley” for its high levels of pollution. Wallace is about 80 kilometers
west of New Orleans.</p>
<p>“I think all of the fighting – it is coming from the love and the
passion for our communities we have here along the river, and to show
the world we can and you should fight,” Banner said. “We are recognizing
that we do have power – that power comes from the love we have for our
community.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Banner sisters’ nonprofit purchased a
plantation which had been the site of one of the largest slave
rebellions in American History, the 1811 German Coast Uprising. They
plan to transform it into an educational space.</p>
<p>The Army Corps of Engineers had already determined the 90-hectare
facility could adversely impact cultural heritage sites in Wallace and
was tasked with reviewing Greenfield’s application.</p>
<p>Army Corps representative Brad LaBorde said his agency had not been
informed in advance of the company’s unexpected decision to cancel plans
for the facility.</p>
<p>“We don’t know exactly what that means,” LaBorde said. “We still have
an active permit application so, if it is Greenfield’s intention to no
longer pursue the project, then we would ask they formally submit a
withdrawal to us so that we can conclude the review.”</p>
<p>Lynda Van Davis, Greenfield’s counsel and head of external affairs,
said the long delay in government approval for the project has been “an
expensive ordeal,” adding that she did not have an answer for when the
company would submit a formal withdrawal to the Army Corps.</p>
<p>“This has been a difficult ride the whole time, we didn’t wake up
yesterday and say we’re done,” Van Davis said. “We said we’ll stay in
the fight a little bit longer, because we’ve become friends with this
community. Unfortunately, how long are we supposed to stay in this
fight?”</p>
<p>The Army Corps had found the project could affect historic properties
in Wallace, including the Evergreen, Oak Alley and Whitney plantations.
There also remained the possibility that the area contained burial sites
for the ancestral Black community.</p>
<p>Some community members had supported the project, believing it would
bring jobs to their town, even as opponents of the facility said tourism
surrounding cultural heritage was already a thriving industry that
deserved greater investment.</p>
<p>“I was looking forward to economic development in my community –
jobs, new businesses, just all around better living for my community,”
said Nicole Dumas, 48, a Wallace resident, who supported the
project.</p>
<p>But the evening became a celebration for others. Angelica Mitchell,
53, held back tears as she took in the company’s announcement. Mitchell
is still recovering from treatment for a rare form of cancer which had
attacked her pancreas, but she chose to attend the public hearing
despite her health struggles. The facility would have been built within
a few hundred feet of her home.</p>
<p>“To hear that they are backing out, I am so excited, my prayers have
been answered, because I’ve been praying for this for the last three
years,” Mitchell said. “I’ve been asking God, just don’t let this plant
come into our community. I don’t want this for our children.”</p>

from energy think tank Ember finds that the world is not on target to
meet 2030 added capacity goals for wind power. Global leaders agreed at
last year’s COP28 that, to be in line with the goal of limiting global
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the world must triple renewables
capacity by the end of the decade. Ember’s report concludes that under
current plans, wind power is set to more than double in that timeframe,
“but fall short of tripling.” Ember also reiterates that China is
“overachieving,” and is on a path to triple its wind capacity from 2022
to 2030. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is underachieving.

The U.S. is the country with the biggest gap between its expected wind
installations and how much new capacity will be needed to meet its 2030
target, followed by India. And most countries don’t even have explicit
wind targets yet. “Amidst the hype of solar, wind is not getting enough
attention, even though it provides cheap electricity and complements
solar,” said Katye Altieri, Ember’s global electricity analyst. “The
path to a cleaner energy future could be shaped by prioritizing improved
policies, regulatory frameworks and financial support.”

Bangladesh, a new interim prime minister is being sworn in and the
economy is reopening, including the crucial garments industry. Then,
three Taylor Swift concerts have been canceled in Vienna, because of
security concerns. It’s a big disappointment for local businesses
expecting to benefit from Swiftanomics. And would you volunteer to pick
up trash while on vacation? Copenhagen is incentivizing visitors to do
so.

id="us-judge-again-dismisses-mexicos-lawsuit-against-most-gun-manufacturers">US
judge again dismisses Mexico’s lawsuit against most gun
manufacturers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — A U.S. federal judge in Massachusetts again dismissed a
$10 billion Mexican government lawsuit against six U.S. gun
manufacturers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mexico had argued the companies knew weapons were being sold to
traffickers who smuggled them into Mexico and decided to cash in on that
market.</p>
<p>However, the judge ruled that Mexico had not provided concrete
evidence that any of the six companies’ activities in Massachusetts were
connected to any suffering caused in Mexico by guns.</p>
<p>Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department said Wednesday the ruling would
allow the lawsuit to proceed against a seventh manufacturer and a gun
wholesaler.</p>
<p>Regarding the dismissal against the others, the department said,
“Mexico is analyzing its options, among them presenting an appeal.”</p>
<p>The case has been a legal rollercoaster.</p>
<p>In early 2022, six companies — not including the seventh manufacturer
— filed to dismiss Mexico’s claims based on the broad protection
provided to gun manufacturers by a 2005 U.S. law, the Protection of
Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA.</p>
<p>The law shields gun manufacturers from damages “resulting from the
criminal or unlawful misuse” of a firearm. Later in 2022, the federal
judge ruled to dismiss the case on those grounds.</p>
<p>Mexico appealed that ruling, and in January the U.S. 1st Circuit
Court of Appeals in Massachusetts revived the lawsuit, saying the PLCAA
did not apply to the claims the guns caused deaths, damages and injuries
in Mexico.</p>
<p>The appeals court returned the case to the lower court, which again
ruled to dismiss the claims against six of the companies.</p>
<p>The Mexican government estimates 70% of the weapons trafficked into
Mexico come from the U.S., according to the Foreign Affairs
Ministry.</p>

‘not confident’ of peaceful power transition if Trump loses
election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he was not
confident about a peaceful transfer of power in the United States if
Republican Donald Trump loses the Nov. 5 presidential election.</p>
<p>“If Trump loses, I’m not confident at all,” Biden said in an
interview with CBS News when asked whether he thought there would be a
peaceful transfer of power after the vote.</p>
<p>“He means what he says. We don’t take him seriously. He means it. All
this stuff about if we lose there’d be a bloodbath,” Biden added.</p>
<p>During a March campaign appearance in Ohio, Trump warned of a
“bloodbath” if he fails win the election. At the time Trump was
discussing the need to protect the U.S. auto industry from overseas
competition, and Trump later said he was referring to the auto industry
when he used the term.</p>
<p>Trump has falsely claimed he won the 2020 election against Biden and
was criminally charged in Washington and Georgia with illegally trying
to overturn the results.</p>
<p>Biden dropped out of the campaign last month after fellow Democrats
called for him to step aside following a poor debate performance against
Trump that raised questions about the Democratic president’s age and
health.</p>
<p>Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, has since captured the
Democratic nomination and is running against Trump.</p>

Storm Debby doles out repeat deluges for weather-weary residents</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>huger, south carolina — Days of rain from Tropical Storm Debby forced
the residents of a South Carolina community to begin the task of
assessing damage left by a cyclone that was spinning over the Atlantic
Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great
Lakes.</p>
<p>Gene Taylor waited Wednesday afternoon for a few inches of water to
drain out of his house as high tide passed at his home along French
Quarter Creek in Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of
Charleston.</p>
<p>Taylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving
stuff out or up higher in his home. It’s a lesson learned the hard way.
Taylor estimates this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his
home in the past nine years.</p>
<p>“To save everything, we’ve learned from the past it’s better be
prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,” Taylor
said.</p>
<p>A few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8
inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home. He said it is an
annoyance, but one he is trying to get used to.</p>
<p>“Eight inches disrupts your whole life,” Grainger said. “You don’t
get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It’s part of living on the
creek.”</p>
<p>The National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up
to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from Tropical Storm Debby.</p>
<p>For Georgia homeowners in suburban Pooler west of Savannah, the
drenching came with a dose of déjà vu. In October 2016, rain from
Hurricane Matthew overwhelmed a nearby canal and flooded several of the
same homes.</p>
<p>Located roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the Atlantic Ocean,
with no creeks or rivers nearby, the inland neighborhood doesn’t seem
like a high-risk location for tropical flooding.</p>
<p>But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for
well over a decade, despite efforts by the local government to fix
them.</p>
<p>Debby also rained on residents all the way up to the Great Lakes and
New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened
another storm system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms,
according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.</p>
<p>Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey
in less than four hours.</p>
<p>Emergency officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones
with loudspeakers in some New York City neighborhoods to tell people in
basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment’s notice. Multiple
water rescues were reported in New York City and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Nearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio by Wednesday
afternoon following severe storms there, according to
PowerOutage.us.</p>
<p>‘Imminent failure’ of dam</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the “imminent failure” of a dam in southeast Georgia was
threatening to swamp a mobile home park and other areas downstream, the
National Weather Service said in a flash flood warning Wednesday
afternoon. The Cypress Lake Dam is in Bulloch County, about 50 miles (80
kilometers) northwest of Savannah.</p>
<p>“If the dam breaks, flash flooding will occur immediately downstream
of the dam,” the weather service said.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster said the state was just
entering Act 2 of a three-act play.</p>
<p>“We’ve been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could
have been,” McMaster said of heavy rains that damaged over 60 homes but
did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.</p>
<p>Act 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and
heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and
inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain could
fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Columbia.</p>
<p>“It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still
think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for
long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,”
Quagliariello said.</p>
<p>Flooding possible next week</p>
<p>The final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in
North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The center of Debby was over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday
afternoon, 55 miles (89 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, the
National Hurricane Center said. The tropical storm could make a second
landfall in either North Carolina or South Carolina, expected late
Wednesday or early Thursday. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1
hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida.</p>
<p>A state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and
Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration.</p>
<p>At least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in
traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a man
in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored
sailboat partially sank.</p>

id="stranded-nasa-starliner-pilots-may-return-to-earth-on-spacex">Stranded
NASA Starliner pilots may return to Earth on SpaceX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — What should have been a quick trip to the
International Space Station may turn into an eight-month stay for two
NASA astronauts if they have to switch from Boeing to SpaceX for a ride
home.</p>
<p>There’s lingering uncertainty over the safety of Boeing’s new
Starliner capsule, NASA officials said Wednesday, and the space agency
is split over the risk. As a result, chances are increasing that test
pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams may have to watch from the space
station as their Starliner is cut loose to return to Earth empty.</p>
<p>If that happens, NASA will leave behind two of four astronauts from
the next SpaceX taxi flight in late September, with the vacant seats set
aside for Wilmore and Williams on the return trip in February. The pair
expected to be gone just a week or two when they launched June 5 as
Starliner’s first crew.</p>
<p>NASA is bringing in additional experts to analyze the thruster
failures experienced by Starliner before it docked. At the same time,
NASA is looking more closely at SpaceX as a backup.</p>
<p>At this point, “we could take either path,” said Ken Bowersox, NASA’s
space operations mission chief.</p>
<p>During a recent meeting, “we heard from a lot of folks that had
concern, and the decision was not clear,” he said. A final decision is
expected by mid-August.</p>
<p>Boeing issued a brief statement following NASA’s news update,
repeating its position that the capsule could still safely bring the
astronauts home.</p>
<p>“We still believe in Starliner’s capability and its flight
rationale,” the company said.</p>
<p>Boeing will need to modify the capsule’s software in case Starliner
ends up returning without a crew.</p>
<p>No serious consideration was given to launching a separate SpaceX
flight just to retrieve Wilmore and Williams, according to commercial
crew program manager Steve Stich.</p>
<p>Tests on the ground have replicated the thrust problems, pointing to
seals as one culprit. But it’s still not understood how or why those
seals swell when overheated and then shrink back to the proper size,
Stich noted. All but one of the Starliner’s five failed thrusters have
since been reactivated in orbit.</p>
<p>These thrusters are essential for allowing Starliner to back away
from the space station following undocking, and for keeping the capsule
in the proper position for moving out of orbit.</p>
<p>At the same time, engineers are grappling over helium leaks in
Starliner’s propulsion system, crucial for maneuvering. The first leak
occurred before liftoff but was deemed isolated and stable. Then more
cropped up in flight.</p>
<p>NASA hired Boeing and SpaceX to ferry astronauts to and from the
space station after the shuttles retired in 2011. SpaceX flew its first
crew in 2020. Boeing stumbled on its first test flight without a crew
and then fell further behind after a repeat demo.</p>
<p>Officials repeated their desire for a backup taxi service on
Wednesday, A situation like this one could happen again, and “that’s why
we want multiple vehicles,” Bowersox said.</p>
<p>The next crew flight will be SpaceX’s 10th for NASA. On Tuesday, it
was delayed for a month until late September to allow for extra time to
figure out how best to handle Starliner’s return. Three NASA astronauts
and one Russian are assigned to the flight, and managers on Wednesday
declined to say who might be bumped.</p>

Park Fire in California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN BERNARDINO, California — Firefighters battled on Wednesday the
reawakened Park Fire, a massive blaze that re-exploded in Northern
California on Monday after several days of slumber and grew by as much
as 53 square kilometers, mostly in about 12 hours.</p>
<p>The Park Fire, California’s largest so far this year and the state’s
fourth largest on record, had scorched nearly 1,676 square kilometers by
Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Firefighters were told during their morning briefing to focus on
safety and to be mindful of extreme fire behavior, including intense and
rapidly moving flames.</p>
<p>The Park Fire was allegedly ignited by arson on July 24 outside the
Sacramento Valley city of Chico and has destroyed 640 structures and
damaged 52.</p>
<p>In Southern California, a fast-moving wildfire that swept into a
hillside community this week destroyed five homes and damaged three
others, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The flames erupted Monday afternoon and chased residents from the
neighborhood in San Bernardino, about 97 kilometers east of Los
Angeles,</p>
<p>One firefighter was treated for a minor injury but there were no
reports of injuries to residents, said Eric Sherwin, spokesperson for
the San Bernardino County Fire Department.</p>
<p>“How quickly this fire hit this community,” Sherwin said, “the fact
that we have no civilians injured is truly a miracle.”</p>
<p>The fire was reported at 2:40 p.m. Monday and stopped progressing
about three hours later after scorching 22 hectares. Containment was
holding at 75%, Sherwin said. All evacuations were lifted late Tuesday
morning.</p>
<p>Investigators were working to determine the cause of the fire, which
erupted amid very dry and hot conditions that have made swaths of
California quick to burn this summer.</p>

<code>pg_dump</code> to set it when available. Note that the attack is
prevented only if both <code>pg_dump</code> and the server it is dumping
from are new enough to have this fix.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.

exists.
</li>
<li>
Fix selection of an arbiter index for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html"><code>INSERT
… ON CONFLICT</code></a> when the desired index has expressions or
predicates, for example, through an updatable view.
</li>
<li>
Refuse to modify a temporary table of another session with
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html"><code>ALTER
TABLE</code></a>.

Fix handling of extended statistics on expressions in
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html"><code>CREATE

hot standby server.
</li>
<li>
Prevent incorrect initialization of logical replication slots.
</li>
<li>
Fix memory leak in the logical replication WAL sender when publishing
changes to a partitioned table whose partitions have row types that are
physically different from the table.
</li>
<li>
Disable creation of stateful TLS session tickets by OpenSSL.
</li>
<li>
Fix how
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpgsql.html">PL/pgSQL</a>
handles integer ranges containing underscores (e.g., <code>FOR i IN
1_001..1_002</code>).
</li>
<li>
Fix incompatibility between
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plperl.html">PL/Perl</a>
and Perl 5.40.
</li>
<li>
Several fixes related to recursive
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html">PL/Python</a>
functions and triggers.
</li>
<li>
Ensure that
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html"><code>pg_restore
-l</code></a> reports dependent table of contents entries correctly.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html"><code>pg_stat_statements</code></a>
now passes a query ID for utility
(non-<code>SELECT</code>/<code>INSERT</code>/<code>UPDATE</code>)
statements that appears in SQL-language functions.
</li>
<li>
Fix for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/postgres-fdw.html"><code>postgres_fdw</code></a>
when mapping a foreign table to a nontrivial remote view.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/postgres-fdw.html"><code>postgres_fdw</code></a>
no longer sends a <code>FETCH FIRST WITH TIES</code> clause to a remote
server.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Updating
</h2>
<p>
All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor
releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or
use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in order to apply this update release; you
may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.
</p>
<p>
Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run
additional post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier
versions for details.
</p>
<p>
For more details, please see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.

<h2>
A Note on the PostgreSQL 17 Beta
</h2>
<p>
This release marks the third beta release of PostgreSQL 17 and puts the
community one step closer to general availability tentatively around the
end of the third quarter.
</p>
<p>
In the spirit of the open source PostgreSQL community, we strongly
encourage you to test the new features of PostgreSQL 17 on your systems
to help us eliminate bugs or other issues that may exist. While we do
not advise you to run PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3 in production environments,
we encourage you to find ways to run your typical application workloads
against this beta release.
</p>
<p>
Your testing and feedback will help the community ensure that the
PostgreSQL 17 release upholds our standards of delivering a stable,
reliable release of the world’s most advanced open source relational
database. Please read more about our
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/developer/beta/">beta testing
process</a> and how you can contribute:

<h2>
Upgrading to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3
</h2>
<p>
To upgrade to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 3 from an earlier version of
PostgreSQL, you will need to use a strategy similar to upgrading between
major versions of PostgreSQL (e.g. <code>pg_upgrade</code> or
<code>pg_dump</code> / <code>pg_restore</code>). For more information,
please visit the documentation section on
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/static/upgrading.html">upgrading</a>.
</p>
<h2>

<h2>
Testing for Bugs &amp; Compatibility
</h2>
<p>
The stability of each PostgreSQL release greatly depends on you, the
community, to test the upcoming version with your workloads and testing
tools in order to find bugs and regressions before the general
availability of PostgreSQL 17. As this is a Beta, minor changes to
database behaviors, feature details, and APIs are still possible. Your
feedback and testing will help determine the final tweaks on the new
features, so please test in the near future. The quality of user testing
helps determine when we can make a final release.
</p>
<p>
A list of
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_17_Open_Items">open
