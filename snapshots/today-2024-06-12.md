Report: New hydropower installations see ‘downward trend’</h3><p>There has been a “downward trend” in global hydropower output over the last five years, according to the International Hydropower Association’s new <a href="https://www.energyglobal.com/other-renewables/12062024/iha-releases-2024-world-hydropower-outlook?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8kpgYWm_EHLWCDsajPP4M8TEd-kkGbQ979f4oWJR0HQtFG0AgoPTSD7MV5ldzXXumatrrk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2024 World Hydropower Outlook</a>.

NO2 emissions rise, but HCFC levels fall</h3><p>Nitrous oxide doesn’t get as much attention as carbon dioxide or methane, but it should: This greenhouse gas is more potent than both, depletes the ozone, and is the third largest contributor to climate change, <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/agriculture-major-driver-of-rise-in-nitrous-oxide-emissions-over-past-40-years/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8kpgYWm_EHLWCDsajPP4M8TEd-kkGbQ979f4oWJR0HQtFG0AgoPTSD7MV5ldzXXumatrrk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>Carbon Brief</em>.

Agriculture emissions of NO2 were 67% higher in 2020 than they were in 1980. The concentration of NO2 in the atmosphere is now 25% higher than in pre-industrial years. “The unfettered increase in a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential approximately 300 times larger than carbon dioxide, presents dire consequences for the planet,” the researchers said in a press release. </p><p>But it’s not all bad news.

The discussions were a lead-up to November’s COP29 in Azerbaijan, where countries are expected to put forward a new annual finance goal for helping vulnerable countries protect themselves from climate change and shift to clean energy. The current target, set in 2009, sits at $100 billion annually.

Rising sea levels threaten Greek island known as mythological birthplace of Apollo </h3><p>One of the most important sites in Greek and Roman mythology is sinking into the sea as climate change causes water levels to rise. The tiny abandoned Greek island of Delos, in the Aegean Sea, was first settled in the third millennium BC and was once a busy port city with 30,000 occupants. In Greek mythology, it was the birthplace of Apollo and his sister Artemis. Today it is dotted with 2,000-year-old archaeological ruins and has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1990.

## Jobs IRL: Georgia bets big on EVs, and Savannahians

date: 2024-06-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>It&#8217;s been called the largest economic development project in Georgia’s history. And it&#8217;s massive — six times the size of Disneyland. When Hyundai&#8217;s Metaplant comes online, it will pump out up to 300,000 electric vehicles per year, plus batteries. Jobs at the plant will pay more than the area average, and job training will be free of charge. We&#8217;ll hear more. Also on the program: banishing medical debt from credit reports.</p>

## US Rep. Nancy Mace overcomes McCarthy-backed challenger to win Republican primary in South Carolina

date: 2024-06-12, from: VOA News USA

COLUMBIA, S.C.  — U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace has won the Republican nomination after a tumultuous second term in South Carolina that saw her go from a critic to an ally of former President Donald Trump and make headlines for plenty of things off the House floor. 


Mace defeated challengers Catherine Templeton and Bill Young in voting that ended Tuesday. She will face a Democratic opponent in the general election in the 1st District, which is the closest thing South Carolina has to a swing district in the Republican-dominated state. 


Trump’s endorsement — after he called her crazy and terrible in 2022 — is just one of many ways Mace has attracted a spotlight far greater than a typical second-term member of Congress. 


She’s a regular on interview shows, often antagonizing the hosts. She calls for her party to moderate on abortion and marijuana but joined seven of the farthest right members to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. 


McCarthy threw his weight against Mace and the other defectors. His political action committee gave a $10,000 contribution to Templeton, and the American Prosperity Alliance, where a McCarthy ally serves as a senior adviser, donated to a group called South Carolina Patriots PAC, which spent more than $2.1 million against Mace. 


Mace has said her positions and beliefs aren’t erratic — she is just reflecting the values of the 1st District, which stretches from the centuries-old neighborhoods of Charleston down the coast to Beaufort County’s booming freshly built neighborhoods of retirees moving to South Carolina from somewhere else. 


Mace, the first woman to graduate from South Carolina's military academy The Citadel, thanked her voters for tuning out the “senseless noise” from her opponents and realizing she is unafraid to stand up to powerful people. 


“When you are the first woman to sit in The Citadel’s barber chair to get all of your hair chopped off, you don’t get your feelings hurt when you don’t get invited to the fancy cocktail parties in Washington, D.C.,” Mace said. “While sometimes I may be a caucus of one, I’m not alone because I’m not there for me — I’m there for each and every one of you.” 


Mace's opponents argued that by seeming to land everywhere on issues, Mace is nowhere. 


Templeton ran South Carolina’s health and environmental agency to some angst a decade ago and in her only political race finished third in the 2018 GOP gubernatorial primary won by Gov. Henry McMaster. Young is a Marine veteran and financial planner. 


Templeton didn't mention Mace's name, but asked Tuesday for her voters to keep backing Republicans. 


“I think it is safe to say everybody in here has the conservative values that we share, and in November we are all going to stand behind our president and we are all going to join together to support the Republican Party,” Templeton said. 


In the Democratic primary, businessman and former International African American Museum CEO Michael Moore defeated Mac Deford, a Citadel graduate and lawyer for a couple of the larger bedroom communities in the district. 


South Carolina lawmakers drew the district to be more Republican after the seat flipped for one term in 2018. The 1st District was the only congressional district won by Nikki Haley over Trump in the 2024 South Carolina Republican presidential primary. 


4th District  


For the second election in a row, U.S. Rep. William Timmons has fought off a spirited challenge in the Republican primary. 


Timmons defeated state Rep. Adam Morgan, the leader of the state House Freedom Caucus who argued Timmons was too liberal. 


Timmons’ divorce — and a widely shared Instagram post by a husband who said Timmons had an affair with his wife — complicated his reelection bid. Timmons has denied the allegations. 


Timmons has Trump's endorsement as he seeks a fourth term in the district anchored by Greenville and Spartanburg. 


Timmons was not in his district Tuesday night, instead staying in Washington, where Republicans only have a two vote majority in the U.S. House. 


He said he was thankful his voters recognized his strong conservative record and saw through the “countless lies” from his opponent.  


“In Washington I am focused on policy not headlines, on representing my constituents not myself, and working with my colleagues instead of working against them,” Timmons said in a statement on social media. 


In November’s general election, Timmons will face Democrat Kathryn Harvey, who helps nonprofit organizations with marketing, fundraising and leadership, and Constitutional Party candidate Mark Hackett. 


3rd District  


South Carolina's 3rd District is open after Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan decided not to run again after seven terms. Duncan's wife of 35 years filed for divorce in 2023, accusing him of several affairs. 


The Republican nomination is going to a runoff between a candidate endorsed by Trump and another endorsed by his good friend McMaster. 


Mark Burns is a Black pastor who has backed Trump since before his first race for president and made it to the runoff after losing twice before in the GOP primary in the neighboring 4th District. 


His opponent is nurse practitioner Sheri Biggs, who along with her husband have been faithful contributors and friends of McMaster for years. 


They defeated five other candidates including South Carolina Rep. Stewart Jones and Kevin Bishop, who handled communications for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham for more than two decades. 


Sherwin-Williams paint store manager Byron Best from Greenwood won the Democratic nomination in the 3rd District. 


Other races  


The only other U.S. House incumbent facing a primary challenger is Republican Rep. Joe Wilson who won the party's nomination as he seeks a 12th full term in the 2nd District, which stretches from suburban areas around Columbia west and south toward Aiken. 


Wilson will face David Robinson II. The U.S. Army veteran who enlisted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and is an advocate for missing people after his son disappeared in the desert in Arizona won the Democratic primary. 


Attorney Duke Buckner won the Republican 6th District primary and will face Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, who is seeking a 17th term in the state's majority-minority district that is bounded by areas around Charleston, Beaufort and Columbia.


In the 7th District Democratic primary, teacher Mal Hyman, who calls himself an independent Democrat, faces Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom veteran Daryl Scott. The winner takes on Republican U.S. Rep. Russel Fry, who is seeking a second term in the district that stretches from Myrtle Beach to Florence in the northeast part of the state.

## How to Fix Electricity Bills in America

	Have you looked at your power bill — like, 
	<em><em>really</em></em> looked at it? If you’re anything like Rob, you pay whatever number appears at the bottom every month and drop it in the recycling. But how everyone’s power bill is calculated — in wonk terms, the “electricity rate design” — turns out to be surprisingly important and could be a big driver of decarbonization.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk about why power bills matter, how Jesse would design electricity rates if he was king of the world, and how to fix rooftop solar in America. This is the finale of our recent series of episodes on rooftop solar and rate design. If you’d like to catch up, you can listen to our previous episodes featuring Sunrun CEO

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><p><strong></strong></p><blockquote>
<strong>
	Robinson Meyer: </strong>There’s other issues we could talk about electricity rate design, and I want to come back to them in a second. But let’s say you were made Grand Vizier of all public utility commissions across the country. How would you fix this? Like, what do we need to do?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>I think there’s basically two options that we have, here — and this is, you know, a reflection of the fact that there is no one unified electricity market structure in the U.S. We have a bunch of different ways that we do things. And so I’ll just sketch two kind of classic examples of that. There are lots of little gradations in between.<br/>
<br/>
One is a kind of traditional regulated market where you get your power from a regulated or publicly owned utility, like a municipal utility, or a rural utility district, or an investor-owned utility. It’s regulated by the state, and you buy power at whatever the regulated rate is. And so, if that’s the case, we need to get those rates right. And by that I mean: There are multiple things you’re paying for when you’re paying for your bill. You’re paying for the actual energy you’re consuming, and that is a kind of volumetric thing — you know, you should pay more the more you consume, all else equal.
	<br/>
<br/>
But the interesting feature of electricity pricing is that it varies from hour to hour because of the fact that demand is changing all the time and renewable energy availability is changing all the time. And so the actual marginal cost of generating electricity depends on this intersection of how much you demand and what the available supply is. And if you have a lot of cheap renewables, for example, flooding the grid, that price could be very low. It could even be zero — when you’re curtailing solar or wind, you have excess free power, effectively. And at other times it can be very expensive when you’re running diesel generators or inefficient gas turbines to meet this sort of peak demand requirements. Electricity prices could be several hundred dollars a megawatt-hour.
	<br/>
<br/>
And so we have a very wide range of pricing and we don’t communicate that at all to people today. And I think we have to restore that, in some way — to let people understand that if you consume more energy during the middle of the day when there’s lots of solar available, even if you don’t have solar on your roof, it’s coming from your neighbor or utility-scale solar farm far away, that’s the cheapest, best time to consume electricity. And if you’re consuming when fossil power plants are producing expensive power, you should think about how to reduce that consumption. So it’s really important that we get that kind of time dynamic rate right for the energy component.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>So you would expose people to prices. I mean, that’s kind of your basic answer is that you would expose people to these time-of-day prices even if — and I just want to be clear, here. You’re talking about folks who live in Washington, D.C., who live in New York, who live in Philadelphia, who live in San Francisco, who live in Atlanta …<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>All over. Yeah, everywhere.

At the Group of Seven summit this week, U.S. President Joe Biden will seek agreement on using interest from frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine’s war effort. He will also push for unity in tackling global challenges such as infrastructure funding, artificial intelligence, and Chinese overcapacity in green technologies.

## UN Chief puts Israeli military, Hamas on blacklist for harming children

date: 2024-06-11, from: VOA News USA

united nations — The United Nation's secretary-general has included Israel's military and Hamas on the annual blacklist of perpetrators who harm children.


"I am appalled by the dramatic increase and unprecedented scale and intensity of grave violations against children in the Gaza Strip, Israel and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem," Antonio Guterres said in the report, which was sent to U.N. Security Council members on Tuesday but has not yet been published.


The annual Children and Armed Conflict report names and shames those who recruit, kill, maim or abduct children, commit sexual violence against them, deny them humanitarian assistance, or attack schools and hospitals. Guterres' special representative Virginia Gamba is mandated by the Security Council to work to prevent and end these violations.


In the report, obtained by VOA, the United Nations said it has verified 8,009 grave violations against Israeli and Palestinian children, but the process is ongoing and slow due to the conflict. Of them, 113 were against Israeli children, and the rest were against Palestinian children in Israel and the Palestinian territories.


The report says most child casualties in Gaza from October 7 to the end of last year were caused by "the use of explosive weapons in populated areas by Israeli armed and security forces."




In addition to Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad was also listed. Both groups are listed for the first time, accused of killing, maiming and abducting children.


The report covers the period from January to December 2023. Hamas carried out its terror attack in Israel on October 7, 2023, triggering the war that is now in its ninth month. The report covers only the casualties reported or verified in 2023.


This is the first time either Israel or Hamas has been included on the report's blacklist, despite the killing and maiming of hundreds of children in at least three previous wars in Gaza.


Israel's armed and security forces are listed for the killing and maiming of children and for attacks on schools and hospitals.


"The inclusion of Israeli forces on the U.N.'s 'list of shame' is long overdue and reflects overwhelming evidence of grave violations against children," Jo Becker, children's rights advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, told VOA in an email.


Israeli officials have expressed outrage at being included on the list, which also includes the Taliban and terror groups al-Qaida and Islamic State.


A U.N. spokesperson said last week that Israel was notified of its inclusion "as a courtesy." The country promptly sought to get ahead of the report's publication, dismissing it as more anti-Israel action by the United Nations.


"Today, the U.N. added itself to the blacklist of history when it joined those who support the Hamas murderers," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday. "The IDF is the most moral army in the world. No delusional U.N. decision will change that."


His United Nations ambassador went further, publishing the video of part of his phone call with Guterres' chief of staff.


"I'm utterly shocked and disgusted by this shameful decision of the secretary-general," Gilad Erdan said in the call on Friday, adding that it would reward Hamas and extend the war.


Russia makes blacklist again


Last year, Russia's armed forces landed on the blacklist for their war in Ukraine. This year, they remained listed despite a significant drop in the number of violations attributed to them. The United Nations verified the killing of 80 children and the maiming of 339 others attributed to Russian forces and affiliated groups.


A senior U.N. official said a decrease was not enough. Russia must continue this trend for at least a year and also sign a joint action plan with Gamba's office to be delisted.


No party previously on the list was delisted this year.


Both sides in Sudan conflict make list 


The situation in Sudan, which devolved into brutal violence in April 2023 when two rival generals went to war in a power struggle that continues today, has seen the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces both land on this year's blacklist.


The report found a dramatic increase in 2023 in the military recruitment and use of children in Sudan, as well as their killing, maiming and sexual abuse. Attacks on schools and hospitals were also reported.


"I urge all parties to take preventive and mitigating actions to avoid and minimize harm and better protect children, including to refrain from the use of explosive devices," Guterres said in the report.


The 2023 report verified nearly 33,000 grave violations committed against the world's children in several countries experiencing conflict — an increase of 21% over the previous year. There were 11,649 confirmed child killings and maimings. Recruitment is again on the rise, after trending downward for the past two years.


Grave violations were reported in countries including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Congo, Myanmar, Somalia and Syria, among others.

## 11 Jun 2024

date: 2024-06-11, from: Miguel de Icaza's blog

<h1 id="swiftnavigation">SwiftNavigation</h1>
<p>To celebrate that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/10103">RealityKit's is coming to MacOS, iOS and iPadOS</a> and is no
longer limited to VisionOS, I am releasing
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigation">SwiftNavigation</a> for
RealityKit.</p>
<p>Last year, as I was building a game for VisionPro, I wanted the 3D characters I
placed in the world to navigate the world, go from one point to another, avoid
obstacles and have those 3D characters avoid each other.</p>
<p>Almost every game engine in the world uses the C++ library
<a href="http://recastnav.com">RecastNavigation</a> library to do this - Unity, Unreal and
Godot all use it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigation">SwiftNavigation</a> was born:
Both a Swift wrapper to the underlying C++ library which leverages extensively
Swift's C++ interoperability capabilities and it directly integrates into the
RealityKit entity system.</p>
<p>This library is magical, you create a <a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/buildingmesh">navigation
mesh</a>
from the world that you capture and then you can <a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/navmeshquery">query it</a> for paths to navigate
from one point to another or you can create a <a href="https://xibbon.github.io/SwiftNavigationDocs/documentation/swiftnavigation/navmesh/makecrowd(maxagents:agentradius:)">crowd
controller</a>
that will automatically move your objects.</p>
<p>Until I have the time to write full tutorials, your best bet is to look at the
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftNavigationDemo">example project</a> that
uses it.</p>

## Jennifer Wilcox on Building the First U.S. Carbon Removal Office

date: 2024-06-11, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ0MDMwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MTIyMjY2OH0._jNmSZE6FXlY8a_3czOrd6PKCQJZ1y2ND4zH92cI3Ls/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">In November of 2020, Jennifer Wilcox had just moved to Philadelphia and was preparing to start a new chapter in her career as a tenured “Presidential Distinguished Professor” at the University of Pennsylvania. Then she got the call: Wilcox was asked to join the incoming Biden administration as the principal deputy assistant secretary for the Office of Fossil Energy, a division of the Department of Energy.</p><p>Wilcox had never even heard of the Office of Fossil Energy and was somewhat uneasy about the title. A chemical engineer by training, Wilcox had dedicated her work to climate solutions. She was widely known for having written the first textbook on carbon capture, published in 2012, and for her trailblazing research into removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. With Penn’s blessing, she decided to take the job. And in the just over three years she was in office, she may have altered the course of U.S. climate action forever.</p><p>First, Wilcox led a total transformation of the department to align it with the Biden administration’s climate goals. She started by arranging 15-minute meetings with each of the nearly 150 employees who worked with her at the D.C. office to understand their perspectives on their work, whether they were happy, and their fears and challenges. She admits she can be intense.</p><p>“I took all that information, and I sat on it with many weekends and a blank piece of paper and a pencil and drew crazy diagrams,” she told me, trying to funnel everyone’s feedback into a new vision for the department. </p><p>Previously, the Office of Fossil Energy’s primary function was to support research into oil, gas, and coal extraction and use. Wilcox flipped the mission on its head, reorganizing the department into one that would support research, development, and deployment of solutions that reduced dependency on those resources and minimized their environmental impacts. By July, she had codified that mission in a new name — the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management.</p><p>Wilcox maxed out her leave this spring. I caught up with her about a week after she left the DOE, as she was picking up where she left off — preparing for her first semester as a professor of chemical engineering and energy policy at Penn. She’s also starting a new side gig as chief scientist at Isometric, a carbon credit certification company that’s trying to improve trust in carbon removal measurement and verification through rigorous standards and transparency.</p><p>I asked her to reflect on her time at the Department of Energy, the changes she oversaw, and what she’s looking to do next. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p><strong>When was your last day at DOE? Did you leave because you had an obligation to come back to Penn?</strong></p><p>My last day was Friday, May 31, so just a week or so ago. Typically, when you’re in an academic tenured position, you can have a maximum of a two-year leave. Within the first year of my appointment at DOE, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law went through, and then in the second year, the IRA went through — the Inflation Reduction Act. And I was like, this is big stuff. It felt like just a defining moment — in my career, but also in terms of climate legislation. And I thought, how could I possibly leave now? So I went back to Penn and I wrote, I thought, a pretty thoughtful letter of the impact that I could have if I could stay just a year and a half longer. And they said yes.</p><p><strong>Could you share the story of how you were asked to go work for the department in the first place?</strong></p><p>Sure, it’s pretty funny. Something that many people don’t know is we have a small farm — we had 22 acres in Massachusetts, and goats and a pig and chickens and oh my goodness. Penn was like, “We’ll move your goats, too,” and so we moved everybody. And here I am at the kitchen table amidst boxes, and the goats are outside, and I’m on my laptop, and I get this email from the Biden-Harris transition team. I was like, ain’t nobody got time for that. That’s spam. Delete! And then a couple days go by and I get another one, and I was like, come on. Is this real? And I forwarded it to my husband. He’s an ER doctor, and he’s like, “Honey, that’s real. You have to respond!” And so I sent my CV.</p><p><strong>One of the first things you did was rename the department. How did that happen? </strong></p><p>When I came in, it was really early days of, okay, net zero by 2050, and there was a question of, what does that mean for our office? Should this office exist in a net zero world?<em> </em>I knew that I was being recruited to think about reshaping, rethinking the portfolio.</p><p>We only had two R&D offices at the time. One was called Oil and Gas — we renamed that Office of Resource Sustainability. The other was literally the Office of Coal. What I decided to do was take that program and move it over. That whole office is all about, if you’re choosing to extract energy resources from the Earth, how do you do it in a way that’s minimal impact? </p><p>Now, what’s left is how you manage the pollution of how we use fossil fuels — that’s the carbon dioxide. And so we built out a whole new division on carbon removal. We teased out a whole program on hydrogen, and then we also separated out carbon conversion into its own division, and then carbon transport and storage. And so rather than one program focused on carbon, we had five, which is pretty cool. I mean, the amount that I was empowered and supported — and by the way, we got it all through without a single pushback, in nine months. So that was huge.</p><p><strong>How would you characterize how the field changed from the time that you entered the office until now? Have research questions changed? Have policy priorities changed?</strong></p><p>I think things are <em><em>starting</em></em> to change. One of the things from these last few years of having the resources that have started to become mobilized, it’s helping us to recognize where the gaps really are. When you have money to be able to put out for certain topic areas, you get to see who’s going to apply, and who applies gives you an indication of where the technology is at and how much of it’s ready. </p><p>For instance, if you look at the $3.5 billion for direct air capture hubs, we had to write the funding opportunity announcement to meet industry where they’re at. There’s only a couple of companies that are really even at a stage where they can start to think about demonstration on the tens of thousands of tons of removal, let alone a million tons per year. </p><p>Some of the gaps that we saw were, in direct air capture, making sure that there’s enough companies that are supported to be able to get us to the scale that we need to. And then for the other approaches to carbon removal, making sure that if we want these projects to be durable, in terms of carbon removed on a time scale that impacts climate, we need to figure out how to quantify the net carbon that’s removed. </p><p>And then one significant gap that we saw that we are trying to fill with this funding: When we think about corporations and net zero pledges, a lot of times the carbon removal purchasing is associated with Scope 3 emissions that companies don’t have the ability to control. These are supply chains. It could be paper, it could be fuel, food, glass, cement, steel. And so looking at that whole sector, it’s about 10 different industrial sectors that we need to figure out how to decarbonize. If we can think about decarbonizing these supply chains, it’ll take some of the pressure off of the carbon removals to counterbalance those. </p><p>The last piece that I feel like gets forgotten is, in the infrastructure law, we had $2.5 billion for building out geologic storage. That’s an issue because you can do the carbon capture, but the big question is, where are you going to put it? And can you get it from point A to point B? We have a whole program called CarbonSAFE that essentially shepherds the industry through the process, starting with characterization all the way to a class six permit from EPA. Building that capacity out means that’s one less thing that industry has to worry about as they’re looking at carbon capture.</p><p><strong>During your time there, the department was interfacing with hundreds of researchers and startup founders who were all trying to get new projects or companies off the ground. I’m curious, what are some of the most common misunderstandings you saw from applicants? </strong></p><p>There’s a couple of things, but one that stands out — and maybe this is because I have a background in academia — there’s a lot of technologies out there that are actually pretty far along, especially in point source capture [technologies that capture carbon from the smokestacks of industrial facilities before it enters the atmosphere]. Yet, at universities, they’re still trying to develop the next solvent or solid sorbent. It’s like, we can stop doing that. </p><p>Where the R&D comes in is actually getting data over a long period of time. How does the material behave? How can we recycle it and reuse it over and over again? How can we design it in a way that reduces NOx, SOx pollution, particulate matter, making the air cleaner? But it’s not about how do we just develop a new technology, because there’s a lot out there. </p><p><strong>It seems like one of the hardest things the department was trying to do under your leadership was to strengthen its work on community engagement and community benefits — hard because many advocates for fenceline communities are so skeptical of the solutions you were working on. How did you navigate that tension?</strong></p><p>Well, one thing is, I know what I don’t know, and I’m usually pretty willing to say what I’m good at and what I’m not good at. In the early days, I knew that this was going to be a challenge for our office and so I recruited a social scientist: Holly Jean Buck, she’s a professor at the University of Buffalo. We brought Holly in to help us develop some of the language around … it started off with community benefits, but some of our investments don’t always lead to benefits, so let’s be honest, right? And so what we wanted to think about is, what are the societal considerations and impacts of our investments? We ended up recruiting a few others, and now we have a team that’s focused on domestic engagement, and also communications and outreach. </p><p><strong>What do you think it could mean for some of what you’ve accomplished and other things you’ve set in motion if Biden is not reelected?</strong></p><p>I feel pretty good about what we’ve put in place, that it’s sustainable. The other thing about what I saw is that industry is really leaning in on doing these things. The low-carbon supply chains — a lot of glassmakers, cement facilities — are very interested in improving energy efficiency, are interested in carbon capture or using hydrogen as a heat source. And so what we have done is really looking at making sure they’re economic. All of these efforts that we’ve put in place are extremely bipartisan, and they’re essentially just supporting industry in a way such that they’re achievable because they’re economic.</p><p><strong>Let’s talk a little bit about what’s next. Why did you want to work with Isometric? What are you going to be doing there? </strong></p><p>When I was at DOE, from the beginning, we were looking at, you know, there’s a lot of the carbon removal portfolio where we don’t have the rigor in place to be able to determine the durability of the removals, the additionality of them, the time scale on which the carbon is actually removed, quantifying net removed. And so we started a commercialization effort, leveraging our national labs to help us to develop the framework. Isometric is working toward establishing rigorous frameworks, and I’m hoping to leverage the efforts ongoing at DOE — and with transparency, so that others may follow, which could lead to more durable removals and greater impact at the end of the day. </p><p><strong>What about on the academic side of your career. Where do you plan to focus your research?</strong></p><p>Some of the work that we were doing, or the team has been continuing to do while I’m at DOE, is mineralization, looking at different waste feedstocks that have alkalinity [a property that’s useful for carbon removal], like magnesium and calcium. One of the things that we’re going to focus a little bit more on is asking the question of, what else is there? You know, if there’s rare earth elements or critical minerals that could be used for clean energy technologies, EV motors, magnets for wind turbines. And so, I’m really excited about looking at these materials and seeing what value is there. </p><p>I’m also really excited about helping with the measurement and quantification of some of the more natural systems of removal, like forests. One of the new majors at Penn is artificial intelligence. I think there’s an opportunity right now to think about, how can we take data, whether it’s from drones or whether it’s from Lidar and airplanes or satellite data, bringing it together in an integrated way again, so that we have more robust databases that are also transparent. </p><p><strong>There’s so many debates going on around carbon removal right now, and it feels like they often come down to philosophical differences. Are these debates important? Or do we just need to decide what we’re going to do and then reevaluate it later?</strong></p><p>We’re not in a position anymore to think we can just decarbonize and not do greenhouse gas removals. We know we need to do both. And so I think that there are some kind of “no regrets” things that we can do — opportunities, as we’re scaling up both in the near term, to think about them in a coordinated way. In communities that don’t have solar today, imagine you have a direct air capture facility going in, and then they’re bringing clean energy that they’re using for direct air capture, but they’re bringing it for the first time ever to a community that wouldn’t otherwise have access. </p><p>But it really is regional. I think it’s regional in that there’s limited resources in any given region, whether it’s low-carbon energy, land, clean water, even geologic pore space. You have it in some states and not others. And so we really need to look at those resources and always prioritize decarbonizing, but recognize that it’s not necessarily one or the other. </p>

## These Wrongly Arrested Black Men Say A California Bill Would Let Police Misuse Face Recognition

date: 2024-06-11, updated: 2024-06-11, from: The LAist

Three men falsely arrested based on face recognition technology have joined the fight against a California bill that aims to place guardrails around police use of the technology. They say it will still allow abuses and misguided arrests.

## Under pressure from Russian censors, Mozilla removes anti-censorship extensions

date: 2024-06-11, from: OS News

A few days ago, I was pointed to a post on the Mozilla forums, in which developers of Firefox extensions designed to circumvent Russian censorship were surprised to find that their extensions were suddenly no longer available within Russia. The extension developers and other users in the thread were obviously not amused, and since they had received no warning or any other form of communication from Mozilla, they were left in the dark as to what was going on. I did a journalism and contacted Mozilla directly, and inquired about the situation. Within less than 24 hours Mozilla got back to me with an official statement, attributed to an unnamed Mozilla spokesperson: Following recent regulatory changes in Russia, we received persistent requests from Roskomnadzor demanding that five add-ons be removed from the Mozilla add-on store. After careful consideration, we’ve temporarily restricted their availability within Russia. Recognizing the implications of these actions, we are closely evaluating our next steps while keeping in mind our local community. ↫ Mozilla spokesperson via email I and most people I talked to already suspected this was the case, and considering Russia is a totalitarian dictatorship, it&#8217;s not particularly surprising it would go after browser extensions that allow people to circumvent state censorship. Other totalitarian dictatorships like China employ similar, often far more sophisticated methods of state control and censorship, too, so it&#8217;s right in line with expectations. I would say that I&#8217;m surprised Mozilla gave in, but at the same time, it&#8217;s highly likely resisting would lead to massive fines and possible arrests of any Mozilla employees or contributors living in Russia, if any such people exist, and I can understand a non-profit like Mozilla not having the means to effectively stand up against the Russian government. That being said, Mozilla&#8217;s official statement seems to imply they&#8217;re still in the middle of their full decision-making process regarding this issue, so other options may still be on the table, and I think it&#8217;s prudent to give Mozilla some more time to deal with this situation. Regardless, this decision is affecting real people inside Russia, and I&#8217;m sure if you&#8217;re using tools like these inside a totalitarian dictatorship, you&#8217;re probably not too fond of said dictatorship. Losing access to these Firefox extensions through the official add-store will be a blow to their human rights, so let&#8217;s hope the source code and &#8216;sideloaded&#8217; versions of these extensions remain available for them to use instead.

## Apple WWDC 2024: the 13 biggest announcements

date: 2024-06-11, from: OS News

Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote has come to a close — and the company had a whole lot to share. We got our first look at the AI features coming to Apple’s devices and some major updates across the company’s operating systems. If you missed out on watching the keynote live, we’ve gathered all the biggest announcements that you can check out below. ↫ Emma Roth at The Verge Most of the stuff Apple announced aren&#8217;t particularly interesting &#8211; a lot of catch-up stuff that has become emblematic of companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft when it comes to their operating systems. The one thing that did stand out is Apple&#8217;s approach to offloading machine learning requests to the cloud when they are too difficult to handle on device. They&#8217;ve developed a new way of doing this, using servers with Apple&#8217;s own M chips, which is pretty cool and harkens back the days of the Xserve. In short, these server are using the same kind of techniques to encrypt and secure data on iPhones, but now to encrypt and secure the data coming in for offloaded machine learning requests. The root of trust for Private Cloud Compute is our compute node: custom-built server hardware that brings the power and security of Apple silicon to the data center, with the same hardware security technologies used in iPhone, including the Secure Enclave and Secure Boot. We paired this hardware with a new operating system: a hardened subset of the foundations of iOS and macOS tailored to support Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads while presenting an extremely narrow attack surface. This allows us to take advantage of iOS security technologies such as Code Signing and sandboxing. ↫ Apple&#8217;s security research blog Apple also provided some insight into where its training data is coming from, and it claims it&#8217;s only using licensed data and &#8220;publicly available data collected by our web-crawler&#8221;. The words &#8220;licensed&#8221; and &#8220;publicly available&#8221; are doing a lot of heavy lifting here, and I&#8217;m not entirely sure what definitions of those terms Apple is using. There are enough people out there who feel every piece of data &#8211; whether under copyright, available under an open source license, or whatever &#8211; is fair, legal game for ML training, so who knows what Apple is using based on these statements alone. From Apple&#8217;s presentations yesterday, as well as any later statements, it&#8217;s also not clear when machine learning requests get offloaded in the first place. Apple states they try to run as much as possible on-device, and will offload when needed, but the conditions under which such offloading happens are nebulous and unclear, making it hard for users to know what&#8217;s going to happen when they use Apple&#8217;s new machine learning features.

## At G7 Italy, Biden to push plans to deal with Russian frozen assets, Chinese overcapacity

date: 2024-06-11, from: VOA News USA

White House  — The last time leaders of the world’s seven richest economies met, at the G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan in 2023, they denounced China’s rising economic security threats and vowed to support Ukraine against Russia’s invasion for as long as it takes.


This week in Apulia, Italy, U.S. President Joe Biden wants the group to restrain the same two adversaries while continuing to tackle common global challenges, including infrastructure funding and AI, or artificial intelligence.


However, a shift to the right of the European political landscape following EU parliamentary elections could complicate his plans.


The U.S. is aiming for the G7 to agree on a united front against Chinese overcapacity, when production of goods exceeds demand, in key green technologies and a mechanism to use Russian frozen assets to aid Ukraine’s war efforts, a source familiar with Biden’s plans told VOA.


On Russia, Biden is pushing a plan to give Kyiv tens of billions of dollars up front, using interest from the approximately $280 billion in Russian assets immobilized in Western financial institutions.




Weeks after announcing new tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, or EVs, and other strategic industries, Biden also wants leaders to confront Beijing’s practice of flooding global markets with cheap exports in those industries.


Much work still needs to be done on both fronts, and officials are scrambling to agree on a final communique before the summit ends.


Shifting political landscape in Europe


With far-right parties gaining support in the European Parliament elections over the weekend, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have been weakened, while G7 host Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni consolidated her power.




The European far-right has divergent views on China and Russia, adding another layer of uncertainty to the G7’s posture. A key factor: whether Ursula von der Leyen can keep her job as president of the European Commission for another five years.


“If von der Leyen remains the likely candidate, we can expect continuity on the G7 agenda — she has been forward-leaning on Ukraine and on China,” said Liana Fix, a fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations.


While von der Leyen is in a strong position, her second term is not guaranteed. Snap French parliamentary elections in late June, as announced by Macron on Sunday following his party’s loss in the parliamentary election, could be the wild card, Fix told VOA. With the prospects of a far-right government, Macron may be hesitant to confirm von der Leyen just a few days before the French elections.


Russian retaliation


Moscow sees the freezing of its assets by Western financial institutions following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine as theft. It has threatened to retaliate, should the G7 agree to adopt the plan pushed by Biden.


The plan will provide Kyiv with a loan of up to $50 billion, which will be paid back to Western allies using interest earned from Russian assets, estimated at $3 billion a year or more until it is paid, or Moscow agrees to pay reparations.




It’s a more aggressive plan than the EU agreed to in May, which would provide Ukraine with the interest income as it is generated annually. It’s also riskier — there’s no guarantee that Russian assets would be immobilized for the duration it takes to repay the loan. Under EU rules, the sanctions regime that freezes the funds must be unanimously renewed every six months by the bloc’s 27 member states.


The push comes as Moscow's forces gained strategic advances on the battlefield, and amid war funding fatigue settling deeper among American and European taxpayers. A deal will be an important signal of transatlantic unity against Russia ahead of the NATO summit in Washington next month and give a measure of relief as Kyiv faces the prospects of a changing political landscape in the U.S. and Europe.


“This used to be partly about (former president Donald) Trump-proofing support to Ukraine, but may now also be about (Marine) Le Pen-proofing it, considering the possibility of (the far-right) National Rally (political party) winning the French parliamentary election in a few weeks,” said Armida van Rij, director of the Europe program at Chatham House.


The prospects of more populist, Putin-friendly politicians coming to power in Europe may help further galvanize support for Biden’s loan plan for Ukraine, she told VOA.


Concern over Chinese overcapacity


“There is no question that the U.S. and Europe share the concern that China is trying to export its way out of its domestic industrial overcapacity problem,” said Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.


G7 finance ministers have highlighted Beijing’s “comprehensive use of non-market policies and practices” and said they will consider “steps to ensure a level playing field, in line with World Trade Organization principles.”


Just as “Trump's greater economic nationalism has forced Biden to be more protectionist,” the rise of right-wing European parties could add more urgency to address Chinese overcapacity, Lachman told VOA.


However, it’s unclear if the G7 can agree on how it would do that. EU members that consider China a major export market, particularly Germany and France, are anxious to avoid a trade war.


The European Commission is expected to soon announce planned tariffs on Chinese EVs. The action could prompt retaliation from Beijing, which accuses the West of hyping overcapacity claims to blunt China’s competitive edge.


AI, migration and international development


Italy’s Meloni has made AI a key priority of her G7 presidency and invited Pope Francis to a special session to highlight the Rome Call for AI Ethics. The initiative urges governments and companies to follow the six ethical principles for AI: transparency, inclusion, responsibility, impartiality, reliability, as well as security and privacy.


Leaders will discuss how AI impacts labor, sustainable development, foreign policy, disinformation, and election interference.


A strategic partnership with Africa to curb migration to Europe is another key theme of Meloni’s G7 presidency. In January, she launched the “Mattei Plan,” an international investment initiative to boost development in the continent, in line with the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which is also known as PGI.


PGI was launched at the G7 2021 summit as “Build Back Better World,” echoing the Biden administration's domestic agenda. The goal is to mobilize $600 billion in private infrastructure funding by 2027 as an alternative to the Chinese Belt and Road initiative that has increased Beijing’s political clout in developing countries.


PGI is now focused on developing economic corridors, including the Lobito Corridor that connects the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia and Angola, and the Luzon Corridor in the Philippines.

## Justice Alito Caught on Tape Discussing How Battle for America ‘Can’t Be Compromised’

                <div class="e-content">
<blockquote><p>"Justice Samuel Alito spoke candidly about the ideological battle between the left and the right — discussing the difficulty of living “peacefully” with ideological opponents in the face of “fundamental” differences that “can’t be compromised.” He endorsed what his interlocutor described as a necessary fight to “return our country to a place of godliness.” And Alito offered a blunt assessment of how America’s polarization will ultimately be resolved: “One side or the other is going to win.”"</p></blockquote><p>If what's at stake in the upcoming election wasn't previously clear, this makes it so. This is a Supreme Court justice, talking openly, on tape, about undermining the rights of people in favor of a Biblical worldview.</p><p>It's easy to see this sort of rhetoric as the dying gasps of the 20th century trying to claw back regressive values that we've mostly moved away from. But to do so is to discount it; we have to take this seriously.</p><p>It's a little bit heartening to hear that Justice Roberts - also a big-C Conservative - felt differently and held a commitment to the Constitution and the working of the Court.

## Hunter Biden convicted of 3 felonies in federal gun trial

date: 2024-06-11, from: VOA News USA

WILMINGTON, Del.  — Hunter Biden has been convicted of all three felony charges related to the purchase of a revolver in 2018 when, prosecutors argued, the president's son lied on a mandatory gun-purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs.


Jurors found Hunter Biden guilty of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.


He faces up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced by Judge Maryellen Noreika, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether she would give him time behind bars.




Now, Hunter Biden and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the chief political rival of President Joe Biden, have been convicted by American jurors in an election year that has been as much about the courtroom as it has been about campaign events and rallies.


Joe Biden has steered clear of the federal courtroom in Delaware where his son was tried and said little about the case, wary of creating an impression of interfering in a criminal matter brought by his own Justice Department. But allies of the Democrat have worried about the toll that the trial — and now the conviction — will take on the 81-year-old, who has long been concerned with his only living son's health and sustained sobriety.


Hunter Biden and Trump have both argued they were victimized by the politics of the moment. But while Trump has continued to falsely claim the verdict was "rigged," Joe Biden has said he would accept the results of the verdict and would not seek to pardon his son.


After the jury's decision was announced, President Biden said he accepts the outcome of the case and "will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal."


"Jill and I will always be there for Hunter and the rest of our family with our love and support. Nothing will ever change that," the president said in a statement.


Hunter Biden's legal troubles aren't over. He faces a trial in September in California on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes and congressional Republicans have signaled they will keep going after him in their stalled impeachment effort into the president. The president has not been accused or charged with any wrongdoing by prosecutors investigating his son.


The prosecution devoted much of the trial to highlighting the seriousness of Hunter Biden's drug problem, through highly personal testimony and embarrassing evidence.


Jurors heard Hunter Biden's ex-wife and a former girlfriend testify about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. Jurors saw images of the president's son bare-chested and disheveled in a filthy room, and half-naked holding crack pipes. And jurors watched video of his crack cocaine weighed on a scale.




Hunter Biden did not testify but jurors heard his voice when prosecutors played audio excerpts of his 2021 memoir "Beautiful Things," in which he talks about hitting bottom after the death of his brother Beau in 2015, and his descent into drugs before his eventual sobriety.


Prosecutors felt the evidence was necessary to prove that Hunter, 54, was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied when he checked "no" on the form that asked whether he was "an unlawful user of, or addicted to" drugs.


Defense attorney Abbe Lowell had argued that Hunter Biden's state of mind was different when he wrote the book than when he bought the gun — when he didn't believe he had an addiction. Lowell pointed out to jurors that some of the questions on the firearms transaction record are in the present tense, such as "are you an unlawful user of or addicted to" drugs.


And Lowell suggested Hunter Biden might have felt he had a drinking problem at the time, but not a drug problem. Alcohol abuse does not preclude a gun purchase.


Hunter Biden had hoped last year to resolve a long-running investigation federal investigation under a deal with prosecutors that would avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Under the deal, he would have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax offenses and avoid prosecution in the gun case if he stayed out of trouble for two years.


But the deal fell apart after Noreika, who was nominated by Trump, questioned unusual aspects of the proposed agreement, and the lawyers could not resolve the matter.


Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed top investigator David Weiss, Delaware's U.S. attorney, as a special counsel last August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.


Hunter Biden has said he was charged because the Justice Department bowed to pressure from Republicans who argued the Democratic president's son was getting special treatment.


The reason that law enforcement raised any questions about the revolver is because Hallie Biden, Beau's widow, found it unloaded in Hunter's truck on Oct. 23, 2018, panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at Janssen's Market, where a man inadvertently fished it out of the trash. She testified about the episode in court.


Hallie Biden, who had a romantic relationship with Hunter after Beau died, eventually called the police. Officers retrieved the gun from the man who inadvertently took the gun along with other recyclables from the trash. The case was eventually closed because of lack of cooperation from Hunter Biden, who was considered the victim.

The design “would be a landmark for the American nuclear industry” because it calls for cooling with liquid sodium instead of the standard water-cooling of American nuclear plants. “This technique promises eventual lower construction costs because it requires less pressure than water (meaning less need for expensive safety systems) and can also store heat, turning the reactor into both a generator and an energy storage system.” TerraPower is still waiting for its construction permit to be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and <em><em>The</em></em> <em><em>Associated Press</em></em> reported the work that began yesterday is just to get the site ready for speedy construction if the permit goes through.
</p><h3>2. Construction begins on Brooklyn’s big offshore wind hub</h3><p>
	Another big energy project also broke ground yesterday: The <a href="https://www.empirewind.com/2024/02/01/south-brooklyn-marine-terminal-design-approval/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-95cbU0bgCj0BYMlyFsJ789lmxT939hWOAcOdsnFkNpUXncZRWmGXZuMSAxHjMVNEN0Rn0B" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">South Brooklyn Marine Terminal</a> will support Equinor’s 54-turbine Empire Wind 1 project and be the largest offshore wind port in the U.S. once completed. The terminal spans 73 acres in Sunset Park. Along with supporting the assembly and storage of wind turbine components, it will also house a substation connecting energy from Empire Wind 1 to the grid. Empire Wind will deliver 810 megawatts of renewable energy to New York, enough to power nearly 500,000 homes. The terminal’s construction is expected to be finished by the end of 2026. Below you can see what the port looks like now, and a rendering of the finished project:

</p><h3>3. Environmental Defense Fund will invest in solar geoengineering research</h3><p>
	The nonprofit group Environmental Defense Fund will start funding research into solar geoengineering, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/climate/edf-solar-geoengineering-research.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-95cbU0bgCj0BYMlyFsJ789lmxT939hWOAcOdsnFkNpUXncZRWmGXZuMSAxHjMVNEN0Rn0B" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Up until very recently, solar geoengineering was “one of climate science’s biggest taboos,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/climate-tech-geoengineering-carbon-removal?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-95cbU0bgCj0BYMlyFsJ789lmxT939hWOAcOdsnFkNpUXncZRWmGXZuMSAxHjMVNEN0Rn0B" rel="noopener" target="_self">as Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer put it</a>. That’s because it involves trying to cool the planet by reflecting the sun’s heat back into space. Some scientists and environmentalists worry geoengineering could have unintended consequences for the climate, and would give greenhouse gas emitters an excuse to keep on polluting. But as temperatures soar and global emissions remain stubbornly high, scientists have started to embrace the idea, and the EDF says because the topic isn’t going away, it wants to fund solid research that can help inform policymakers should geoengineering get the greenlight in the future. The EDF is looking to issue its first grants this fall.

## Chinese police say man under arrest in stabbing of US college instructors

date: 2024-06-11, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING  — Chinese police have detained a suspect in a stabbing attack on four instructors from Iowa's Cornell College who were teaching at a Chinese university in the northeast city of Jilin, officials said Tuesday.


Jilin city police said a 55-year-old man surnamed Cui was walking in a public park on Monday when he bumped into a foreigner. He stabbed the foreigner and three other foreigners who were with him, and also stabbed a Chinese person who approached in an attempt to intervene, police said.


The instructors from Cornell College were teaching at Beihua University, officials at the U.S. school said.


The injured were rushed to a hospital for treatment and none was in critical condition, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a daily briefing Tuesday. He said police believe the attack in Jilin city's Beishan Park was an isolated incident, based on a preliminary assessment, and the investigation is ongoing.


Cornell College President Jonathan Brand said in a statement that the instructors were attacked while at the park with a faculty member from Beihua, which is in an outlying part of Jilin, an industrial city about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) northeast of Beijing. Monday was a public holiday in China.


The State Department said in a statement it was aware of reports of a stabbing and was monitoring the situation. The attack happened as both Beijing and Washington are seeking to expand people-to-people exchanges to help bolster relations amid tensions over trade and such international issues as Taiwan, the South China Sea and the war in Ukraine.


An Iowa state lawmaker posted a statement on Instagram saying his brother, David Zabner, had been wounded during a stabbing attack in Jilin. Rep. Adam Zabner described his brother as a doctoral student at Tufts University who was in China under the Cornell-Beihua relationship.


"I spoke to David a few minutes ago, he is recovering from his injuries and doing well," Adam Zabner wrote, adding that his brother was grateful for the care he received at a hospital.


News of the incident was suppressed in China, where the government maintains control on information about anything considered sensitive. News media outlets had not reported it. Some social media accounts posted foreign media reports about the attack, but a hashtag about it was blocked on a popular portal and photos and video of the incident were quickly taken down.


Cornell spokesperson Jen Visser said in an email that the college was still gathering information about what happened.


Visser said the private college in Mount Vernon, Iowa, partners with Beihua University. A college news release from 2018, when the program started, says Beihua provides funding for Cornell professors to travel to China to teach a portion of courses in computer science, mathematics and physics over a two-week period.


According to a 2020 post on Beihua's website, the Chinese university uses American teaching methods and resources to give engineering students an international perspective and English-language ability.


About one-third of the core courses in the program use U.S. textbooks and are taught by American professors, according to the post. Students can apply to study for two years of their four-year education at Cornell College and receive degrees from both institutions.


Chinese President Xi Jinping has unveiled a plan to invite 50,000 young Americans to China in the next five years, though Chinese diplomats say a travel advisory by the U.S. State Department has discouraged Americans from visiting China.


Citing arbitrary detentions as well as exit bans that could prevent Americans from leaving the country, the State Department has issued a Level 3 travel advisory — the second-highest warning level — for mainland China. It urges Americans to "reconsider travel" to China.


Some American universities have suspended their China programs due to the travel advisory.


Lin, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said China has taken effective measures to protect the safety of foreigners. "We believe that the isolated incident will not disrupt normal cultural and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries," he said.

## The money conundrum

date: 2024-06-11, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I wrote about my dislike of money before on this site. Money and everything related to it is by far the part I enjoy the least about my job. And it’s a non-negligible part of it considering I worked solo my entire life. What’s hard for me is this idea of attaching a monetary value to what I do. I was struggling doing it 13 years ago, when I started my career, I’m struggling with it today and I’m sure it won’t change anytime soon. That’s because work, for me, is not a matter of trading money for a service. It’s a human interaction. And adding money to a human interaction makes no sense.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I get why it does make sense in a practical sense. I’m not an idiot. I just don’t understand it at a more deeply personal level. What drives me is the desire to help people. This is either directly, with my job or indirectly, with the other things I do online. And when you’re driven by this desire to help others, money becomes a painful obstacle. Because I just can’t spend my time helping others and not earn a living. It’s just not an option. So I have to compromise.</p>
<p>I discussed this topic in the past with various people and one of the feedback I got is to treat work just as a way of earning enough to free more time that I can then use to help others. That’s a reasonable suggestion but I just can’t apply it to my life. I don’t know why, I can’t get into that type of mindset. I’m sure part of this is the good old impostor syndrome which I’ll have to confront at some point but part is just the nature of who I am as a person.</p>
<p>This is also why I struggle with the idea of monetising my side projects. It’s why I love the “Pay What You Want” model because it eliminates the burden of having to put a price on what I do.</p>
<p>This constant tension between money on one side and the desire to help others on the other is also why I live on the edge of constant burnout. Saying no to people is hard when you know you have the skills necessary to help them. And it’s why I always end up with way too many projects going on at the same time and find myself waking up in the middle of the night thinking about all the things that I have to do and I won’t have time to do. And it sucks. I know it’s not a healthy way of living but I have not yet learned how to do things differently.</p>
<p>Money sucks. It sucks that we constantly have to keep it in mind. It sucks that we can’t just ignore it and focus on the things that matter. Money is also weird. You’d think that the same amount of money would make the same type of impact in my life but it clearly doesn’t. Every time someone signs up for my “one a month” membership I’m super happy. And it’s just 1$. Actually, it’s not even 1$ because after the various fees I’m left with roughly 70 cents. But those 70 cents have meaning. But 70 extra cents on a client invoice is a rounding error. I don’t even care. Hell, earning 2000$ doesn’t have the same effect from a personal standpoint as getting one extra subscriber for 1$ a month. Human psychology is fascinating.</p>
<hr />
<p>Speaking of one-a-month members, I recently tweaked my <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/supporters">supporters page</a> because I hated the idea of not having a place to acknowledge those people who were kind enough to support what I do at some point but are no longer active subscribers. Just removing them from the list didn’t feel right so I added an extra section for past members.</p>
<p>The internet would really benefit from having a native way to let people support each other. It’s great that services like <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a> exist but also part of me would love to have all these functionalities integrated at the browser level somehow. I’m sure someone is reading this and screaming “Crypto! Blockchain!” but I doubt that’s a solution.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m curious to know if you have thoughts on this whole money thing so if you do, please get in touch.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## Rev. James Lawson Jr., civil rights leader who preached nonviolent protest, dies at 95

date: 2024-06-11, from: VOA News USA

Los Angeles — The Rev. James Lawson Jr., an apostle of nonviolent protest who schooled activists to withstand brutal reactions from white authorities as the Civil Rights Movement gained traction, has died, his family said Monday. He was 95.


His family said Lawson died on Sunday after a short illness in Los Angeles, where he spent decades working as a pastor, labor movement organizer and university professor.


Lawson was a close adviser to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who called him “the leading theorist and strategist of nonviolence in the world.”


Lawson met King in 1957, after spending three years in India soaking up knowledge about Mohandas K. Gandhi’s independence movement. King would travel to India himself two years later, but at the time, he had only read about Gandhi in books.


The two Black pastors -- both 28 years old -- quickly bonded over their enthusiasm for the Indian leader’s ideas, and King urged Lawson to put them into action in the American South.


Lawson soon led workshops in church basements in Nashville, Tennessee, that prepared John Lewis, Diane Nash, Bernard Lafayette, Marion Barry, the Freedom Riders and many others to peacefully withstand vicious responses to their challenges of racist laws and policies.


Lawson’s lessons led Nashville to become the first major city in the South to desegregate its downtown, on May 10, 1960, after hundreds of well-organized students staged lunch-counter sit-ins and boycotts of discriminatory businesses.




Lawson’s particular contribution was to introduce Gandhian principles to people more familiar with biblical teachings, showing how direct action could expose the immorality and fragility of racist white power structures.


Gandhi said “that we persons have the power to resist the racism in our own lives and souls,” Lawson told the AP. “We have the power to make choices and to say no to that wrong. That’s also Jesus.”


Years later, in 1968, it was Lawson who organized the sanitation workers strike that fatefully drew King to Memphis. Lawson said he was at first paralyzed and forever saddened by King’s assassination.


“I thought I would not live beyond 40, myself,” Lawson said. “The imminence of death was a part of the discipline we lived with, but no one as much as King.”




Still, Lawson made it his life’s mission to preach the power of nonviolent direct action.


“I’m still anxious and frustrated,” Lawson said as he marked the 50th anniversary of King’s death with a march in Memphis. “The task is unfinished.”


Civil rights activist Diane Nash was a 21-year-old college student when she began attending Lawson's Nashville workshops, which she called life-changing.


“His passing constitutes a very great loss,” Nash said. “He bears, I think, more responsibility than any other single person for the civil rights movement of Blacks being nonviolent in this country.”


James Morris Lawson Jr., was born on Sept. 22, 1928, the son and grandson of ministers, and grew up in Massillon, Ohio, where he became ordained himself as a high school senior.


He told The Tennessean that his commitment to nonviolence began in elementary school, when he told his mother that he had slapped a boy who had used a racial slur against him.


“What good did that do, Jimmy?” his mother asked.


That simple question forever changed his life, Lawson said. He became a pacifist, refusing to serve when drafted for the Korean War, and spent a year in prison as a conscientious objector. The Fellowship of Reconciliation, a pacifist group, sponsored his trip to India after he finished a sociology degree.


Gandhi had been assassinated by then, but Lawson met people who had worked with him and explained Gandhi’s concept of “satyagraha,” a relentless pursuit of Truth, which encouraged Indians to peacefully reject British rule. Lawson then saw how the Christian concept of turning the other cheek could be applied in collective actions to challenge morally indefensible laws.


Lawson was a divinity student at Oberlin College in Ohio when King spoke on campus about the Montgomery bus boycott. King told him, “You can’t wait, you need to come on South now,‘” Lawson recalled in an Associated Press interview.




Lawson soon enrolled in theology classes at Vanderbilt University, while leading younger activists through mock protests in which they practiced taking insults without reacting.


The technique swiftly proved its power at lunch counters and movie theaters in Nashville, where on May 10, 1960, businesses agreed to take down the “No Colored” signs that enforced white supremacy.


“It was the first major successful campaign to pull the signs down,” and it created a template for the sit-ins that began spreading across the South, Lawson said.


Lawson was called on to organize what became the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, which sought to organize the spontaneous efforts of tens of thousands of students who began challenging Jim Crow laws across the South.


Angry segregationists got Lawson expelled from Vanderbilt, but he said he never harbored hard feelings about the university, where he returned as a distinguished visiting professor in 2006, and eventually donated a significant portion of his papers.


Lawson earned that theology degree at Boston University and became a Methodist pastor in Memphis, where his wife Dorothy Wood Lawson worked as an NAACP organizer. They moved several years later to Los Angeles, where Lawson led the Holman United Methodist Church and taught at California State University, Northridge and the University of California, Los Angeles. They raised three sons, John, Morris and Seth. 


Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Lawson taught Southern California activists and organizers “and helped shape the civil rights and labor movement locally just as he did nationally.”


“Today Los Angeles joins the state, country and world in mourning the loss of a civil rights leader whose critical leadership, teachings, and mentorship confronted and crippled centuries of systemic oppression, racism and injustice," Bass said in a statement.


Lawson remained active into his 90s, urging younger generations to leverage their power.


Civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, called Lawson “the ultimate preacher, prophet, and activist.”


“In his senior years, I was privileged to spend time with him at his church in Los Angeles,” Sharpton said. “He would sit in his office and tell me inside stories of the battles of the 1950’s and 1960’s that he Dr. King and others engaged in. Lawson helped to change this nation — thank God the nation never changed him.”


Eulogizing the late Rep. John Lewis last year, he recalled how the young man he trained in Nashville grew lonely marches into multitudes, paving the way for major civil rights legislation.


“If we would honor and celebrate John Lewis’ life, let us then re-commit our souls, our hearts, our minds, our bodies and our strength to the continuing journey to dismantle the wrong in our midst,” Lawson said.

## Curves on a Coordinate Axis

date: 2024-06-11, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid

<p>
The narrator, in Tokarczuk’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flights_(novel)">Flights</a>,
explains their difficulty in studying psychology, which I think is also
a good commentary on the difficulty of layering quantitative methods
over qualitative ones, and the tyranny of categories more generally:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
How was I supposed to analyze others when it was hard enough for me to
get through all those tests? Personality diagnostics, surveys, multiple
columns on multiple-choice questions all struck me as too hard. I
noticed this handicap of mine right away, which is why at university,
whenever we were analyzing each other for practice, I would give all of
my answers at random, whatever happened to occur to me. I’d wind up with
the strangest personality profiles–curves on a coordinate axis. “Do you
believe that the best decision is also the decision that is easiest to
change?” Do I believe? What kind of decision? Change? When? Easiest how?
“When you walk into a room, do you tend to head for the middle or the
edges?” What room? And when? Is the room empty, or are there plush red
couches in it? What about the windows? What kind of view do they have?
The book question: Would I rather read one than go to a party, or does
it also depend on what kind of book it is and what kind of party?
</p>
<p>
What a methodology! It is tacitly assumed that people don’t know
themselves, but that if you furnish them with questions that are smart
enough, they’ll be able to figure themselves out. They pose themselves a
question, and they give themselves an answer. And they’ll inadvertently
reveal to themselves that secret they knew nothing of till now.
</p>
<p>
And there is that other assumption, which is terribly dangerous–that we
are constant, and that our reactions can be predicted. <span
class="citation" data-cites="Tokarczuk:2019">(<a
href="#ref-Tokarczuk:2019" role="doc-biblioref">Tokarczuk, 2019, pp.
14–15</a>)</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It reminds me of a poem by another Polish Nobel Prize winner, Wisława
Szymborska’s <a
href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/149909/a-word-on-statistics">A
Word on Statistics</a>. We can unlock new understanding with words, but
we need to enter into them first.

## Giuliani processed in Arizona in criminal case over 2020 fake electors scheme

date: 2024-06-11, from: VOA News USA

phoenix — Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and Donald Trump attorney, was processed Monday in the criminal case over the effort to overturn Trump's Arizona election loss to Joe Biden, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said. 


The sheriff's office provided a mug shot but no other details. The office of the clerk of the Superior Court for Maricopa County said Giuliani posted bond of $10,000 in cash. 


"Mayor Rudy Giuliani — the most effective federal prosecutor in U.S. history — will be fully vindicated," said his spokesperson, Ted Goodman. "This is yet another example of partisan actors weaponizing the criminal justice system to interfere with the 2024 presidential election through outlandish charges against President Trump and anyone willing to take on the permanent Washington political class." 


Giuliani pleaded not guilty in May to nine felony charges stemming from his alleged role in the fake electors effort. He is among 18 people indicted in the Arizona case, including Trump attorneys John Eastman, Christina Bobb and Jenna Ellis. 


Former Trump presidential chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump 2020 Election Day operations director Michael Roman pleaded not guilty Friday in Phoenix to nine felony charges for their alleged roles in the scheme. 


The indictment alleges Meadows worked with other Trump campaign members to submit names of fake electors from Arizona and other states to Congress in a bid to keep Trump in office despite his November 2020 defeat. 


Other states where criminal charges have been filed related to the fake electors scheme are Michigan, Nevada and Georgia.
