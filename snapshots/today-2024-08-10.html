2024-08-10 An offline reader using NNCP

<p>
<a href="http://www.nncpgo.org/Feeds.html">The NNCP manual</a> suggests
using <code>rss2email</code> to read feeds offline, via NNCP. And why
not! Email is great. <a href="2024-06-29-nncp">Email via NNCP</a> works.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, however, I wondered about a program that would use NNCP
directly to pull new (Markdown) files. Such a “site” wouldn’t have to be
on the web. It wouldn’t need a feed. It would act like a blog because
new files are requested as they are published. They are published by
being linked to from some sort of index. In my case, for example,
<a href="index.md">index.md</a> would be the “blog view” of the site
(you’d only get new pages as they are published) and
<a href="changes.md">changes.md</a> would be the “wiki view” of the site
(you’d get updates if the page changes). Request this file on a regular
bases, then request every file linked to from those pages (unless you
already have a copy).
</p>
<p>
I’ve scripted this all using a bit of Perl. Sadly, installation is not
trivial because there’s no Perl module to turn HJSON into JSON, so I’m
calling the <code>hjson-cli</code> programm which you have to install,
too. Sorry!
</p>
<p>
To install the Perl modules, use CPAN:
</p>
<pre><code>cpan JSON
cpan CommonMark
</code></pre>
<p>
To install <code>hjson-cli</code> if you Go installed:
</p>
<pre><code>go install github.com/hjson/hjson-go/v4/hjson-cli@latest
</code></pre>

fires scorch more than 1.4 million acres in Oregon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Oregon — Wildfires in Oregon have burned more acres of land
in 2024 than in any year since reliable records began, authorities said
Friday, with the mid-August peak of fire season still on the
horizon.</p>
<p>Blazes have scorched more than 5,700 square kilometers (2,200 square
miles), Northwest Interagency Coordination Center spokesperson Carol
Connolly said. That’s more than any other year since 1992, when reliable
records began to be kept, she said. It surpasses the previous record,
set in 2020.</p>
<p>Connolly said 71 large fires have burned most of the land this year.
Large fires are defined as those that consume more than 40 hectares
(nearly 100 acres) of timber or more than 120 hectares (almost 300
acres) of grass or brush.</p>
<p>Thirty-two homes in the state have been lost to the fires, she said,
which have been fueled by high temperatures, dry weather and low
humidity.</p>
<p>They have prompted evacuation notices across the state and largely
torched rural and mountain areas, although some have also sparked closer
to the Portland metro area.</p>
<p>Level 3 “go now” evacuation notices were in place Friday for the
small town of Cherry Grove, about 56 kilometers (35 miles) west of
Portland, as a fire burned in a nearby forest. David Huey, a deputy with
the Washington County Sheriff’s Office, said most residents evacuated
after officers went door to door encouraging them to leave.</p>
<p>Airplanes and helicopters were scooping water from nearby Henry Hagg
Lake to drop on the fire, said Gert Zoutendijk, spokesperson for the
Gaston Rural Fire District. The lake was set to be closed to the public
throughout the weekend.</p>
<p>The fire was roughly 1.3 square kilometers (half a square mile) with
zero containment as of Friday afternoon, although crews have made
progress on lining the fire, Zoutendijk said.</p>
<p>Another fire, near the Portland suburb of Oregon City, led
authorities to temporarily close part of a state highway in the morning
and issue “go now” evacuation orders along part of the route. By
midafternoon, authorities downgraded the evacuation and reopened the
highway.</p>
<p>The largest blaze is the Durkee Fire in eastern Oregon, which has
scorched more than 1,200 square kilometers (459 square miles) but was at
least 95% contained as of Friday, according to authorities. At one point
it was the biggest fire in the country.</p>
<p>California’s Park Fire has since become the largest, burning more
than 1,710 square kilometers (660 square miles) and destroying more than
600 structures. A man was arrested and accused of starting the fire by
pushing a burning car into a gully in a wilderness park outside the
Sacramento Valley city of Chico.</p>
<p>Also in California, the Crozier Fire in El Dorado County has burned
about 7.7 square kilometers (3 square miles) and was 5% contained as of
Friday evening, according to Cal Fire. The fire is burning in steep and
rugged terrain and threatens 4,017 structures. The weather is expected
to remain hot and dry through the weekend.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lakoff">Lakoff</a> talks
about the Nurturing Mother and the Strict Father as models for Democrats
and Republicans respectively, and how the Dems never got this, and never
campaigned accordingly. Now they’re doing it. Owning the nuturing mother
mode, but also the Protective Father, tough and angry when necessary,
but a fun dad, a sweetheart. Biden was that, but we caught him too late
in life for that to really flourish, hence the low approval ratings.
</p>
<p>
I think we can afford now to ignore the NY Times et al. We don’t just
want freedom, we are free, now. That’s what we’re feeling. Now we’re an
army and we’re ready to march. We’re ready to fight and our weapons are
our feet, our voices and our votes. This is why it’s working.
</p>
<p>
At first I didn’t like White Dudes for Harris but now I get it. I saw a
guy who’d normally I’d think of as a MAGA, in the crowd behind Kamala
yesterday while she spoke, I thought yeah us old white dudes need
permission to have sweet hearts. It’s time for us to be happy too. Why
the f not.
</p>
<p>
BTW, Bush had the
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/4924/bush-job-approval-highest-gallup-history.aspx">highest
approval</a> after 9/11 of any president in history. 90 percent.

<h1 id="2024-08-06-pocket-reform">
2024-08-06 Pocket Reform
</h1>
<p>
I got my <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/mnt/pocket-reform">MNT
Pocket Reform</a> miniature laptop! I’m hoping that this will be my new
travel laptop as the Purism laptop I got
<a href="2017-12-23_New_Laptop">back in 2017</a> has a
<a href="2021-08-26_New_laptop%2C_again%E2%80%BD">broken hinge</a>. The
two halves are attached to each other using two super strong hinges. The
hinges are so strong, in fact, that one of them ripped its screws out of
the plastic. So now the screen is held up by just one super strong hinge
and don’t really want to open or close it all that often for fear of
breaking it.
</p>
<p>
Here are my initial impressions of the new MNT Pocket Reform.
</p>
<p>
It is small, but chunky. It’s definitely not flat. It also isn’t heavy,
so I’m happy. The small keyboard and the small trackball work.
</p>
<p>
I was unable to power it on for the longest time. I had two problems.
</p>
<p>
First, there’s a small standby power switch on the left hand side that
you need to turn on. The manual suggests “using a pointed object such as
a SIM card ejector.” Which I managed to find. And then what do you do?
You use the SIM card ejector like you always do: stab it into the small
hole. So I did that for a bit, wondering at the empty spaces I was a
able to reach. What was I supposed to press? It was only when I started
to really look into the small hole that I realized: there was actually
something to be moved left and right within it!
</p>
<p>
Second, the manual says that to turn it on, “hold <em>Hyper</em> +
<em>Enter</em> for more than 2 seconds.” I pressed those two keys and
the OLED display lit up. There was the menu! There it said “Power On”. I
picked it. Nothing happened. Then the OLED display showed a tiny “T” in
the upper left corner. I did this again and again, exploring the small
menu. The laptop wouldn’t power on no matter how often I selected the
menu. That’s because I didn’t press <em>Hyper</em> + <em>Enter</em> for
<em>more than 2 seconds</em>! Press those keys until the keyboard lights
up with the pink backlights.
</p>
<p>
I setup my root passwords, created my user account, ran <code>sudo apt
update</code> and <code>sudo apt upgrade</code> and looked around at
things. After a few minutes I noticed that there is no indication of the
batteries charging. That made me nervous for a while as I kept seeing
that “1%” charge in the top right corner. It’s probably charging, I
thought. Then the laptop turned off. Oh! I guess it wasn’t charging
after all. What did I miss? Now that it is powered off, I see that the
load percentage starts climbing again.
</p>
<p>
This is what it says right now:
</p>
<pre><code>🔋 3.6                8%
🔋 3.7               Off
                  -1.07A
                  7.57V
</code></pre>
<p>
Why is the second battery off? The manual doesn’t explain what On/Off on
the second line means. It’s an indication of whether the computer is on
or off! For the longest time I thought that the first battery had some
charge and the second battery was “off”. Once I rebooted, it changed to
“On”.
</p>
<p>
In any case, it seems that my problem is that when the laptop powers on
without being connected to a charger, it won’t charge if you do connect
it. Perhaps a new system image would fix it? I’m not sure. I downloaded
an image, unzipped it, wrote it to a microSD card, and maybe booted from
it, but nothing seemed to have changed. I had to provide a root password
and a first username and another password… and that’s it. Was I supposed
to run a command? I don’t know. Did the <code>apt update &amp;&amp; apt
upgrade</code> fix the problem? I don’t know.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, when the laptop suddenly lost power (see above) I waited for it
to recharge for a bit and rebooted. It looked like this had corrupted
the disk, somehow. There are plenty of recovery messages and percentages
ending with an error because something cannot be written to the
read-only file system.
</p>
<p>
The output ends with the following, in an extremely tiny font:
</p>
<pre><code>...
mount: mounting /dev/mmcblk2p2 on /root failed: Structure needs cleaning
Failed to mount /dev/mmcblk2p2 as root file system
</code></pre>
<p>
And now I am dropped in the <code>initramfs</code>. I try figure what
I’m supposed to do. I search for some keywords online but don’t
understand what I’m seeing. Finally, I try to leave with
<code>exit</code>, Ctrl+D and whatever else I can think off. I reboot.
This time there are fewer messages about the filesystem and then I’m
back at the login prompt. It fixed itself.
</p>
<p>
Phew!

<p>
I’m back.

<p>
My take-away is this: usability and user interface issues both large and
small remain a challenge in computers.

<strong>2024-08-07</strong>. Before the login prompt is shown, there is
a long and helpful introduction that flashes by. At the login prompt,
you can specify a different command to run instead of starting the
window manager. I did that, specifying <code>/usr/bin/fish</code> (I
have installed <code>fish</code> and prefer it over the default shell,
<code>bash</code>). This allows you to read the message. I guess it’s
the <code>/etc/reform-help</code> message.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, I learned about all the commands starting with
<code>reform-</code>. Nice! In the manual these tools are mentioned on
page 50.
</p>
<p>
When I run <code>sudo reform-check</code>, it tells me that “eMMC does
not contain the latest uboot” and that I can run
<code>reform-flash-uboot emmc</code> to fix it. Do I dare? The following
two messages are shown and they are not identical. That’s a bit strange.
</p>
<pre><code>W: /boot/flash.bin is not the latest uboot
W: You can update it to the latest version by running as root:
reform-flash-uboot
W: eMMC does not contain latest uboot
W: You can update it to the latest version by running as root:
reform-flash-uboot emmc
</code></pre>
<p>
I guess I’ll run the first command and then <code>reform-check</code>
again.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime I saw that I don’t have the
<code>pocket-reform-handbook</code> installed but that I do have the
<code>reform-handbook</code>. Heh. (The MNT Reform is the bigger
laptop.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, when I run <code>reform-flash-uboot</code> without arguments, I
get an error.
</p>
<pre><code>/usr/sbin/reform-flash-uboot: 59: MMC_BOOT: parameter not set
</code></pre>
<p>
I cannot decide whether this is a typo or not. It looks like one?
</p>
<pre><code>alex@subterraneobombus ~&gt; sudo nl /usr/sbin/reform-flash-uboot|grep MMC_BOOT
    27  if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = false ]; then
    49      if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = true ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$SD_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    53      elif [ &quot;$MMC_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    60      if [ &quot;$EMMC_BOOT&quot; = true ] &amp;&amp; [ &quot;$SD_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
    71      elif [ &quot;$MMC_BOOT&quot; = true ]; then
alex@subterraneobombus ~&gt; grep MMC_BOOT &quot;/usr/share/reform-tools/machines/MNT Pocket Reform with
 i.MX8MP Module.conf&quot;
EMMC_BOOT=true
</code></pre>
<p>
Do I really want to do this? Luckily, I mentioned this issue on IRC, and
<a class="account" href="https://floss.social/@josch" title="@josch@floss.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="josch">@josch</span></a> pointed me to this
post by
<a class="account" href="https://macaw.social/@andypiper" title="@andypiper@macaw.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="andypiper">@andypiper</span></a>:
<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/updating-uboot/2348">Updating
uboot?</a>. This is the important bit:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Do <em>not</em> flash u-boot to emmc on the pocket reform. There is a
bug in the u-boot offset which will make your pocket unbootable if you
fix the other bug in reform-flash-uboot. – josch on IRC
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Oof! Disaster narrowly avoided. And now I understand what Andy Piper
means when he writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I also managed to temporarily brick the machine by corrupting the uboot
in flash, and needed to rig it up with Dupont wires on headers and
access the machine from another via USB to get back to where I wanted to
be. –

</blockquote>
<p>
Andy’s post had a screenshot showing the fediverse client
<a href="https://tuba.geopjr.dev/">Tuba</a> which is available on Debian
testing. Nice! I’ll give it a try.
</p>
<p>
Tuba requires a “login” keyring so I had to install
<code>seahorse</code> also known as “Passwords and Keys”. See
<a href="https://github.com/GeopJr/Tuba/wiki/keyring-issues">keyring
issues</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
Back to small things to watch out for. When I run <code>apt
update</code> it ends with a notice saying: “Missing Signed-By in the
sources.list(5) entry for
<code>https://mnt.re/reform-debian-repo</code>”
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-10</strong>. After a recent upgrade,
<a href="https://community.mnt.re/t/after-apt-upgrade-today-battery-in-waybar-stuck-at-100/2299">the
battery indicator stopped working</a>. It just kept on showing 100%. The
temporary fix, based on the discussion in the forum:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>sudo apt install upower</code>
</li>
<li>
edit <code>~/.config/waybar/config</code> and replace
<code>"battery"</code> with <code>"upower"</code> on line 7
</li>
<li>
restart the window manager
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You don’t need to configure <code>waybar-upower(5)</code> because the
defaults are good. I didn’t delete the config for
<code>waybar-battery(5)</code> because as far as I can tell, the idea is
to go back to it.
</p>
<p>
While we’re looking at the window manager, this is my new background
image:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-08-06-pocket-reform-1.jpg" alt="a mountain in inverse colours, so the green grass is instead magenta so it matches the MNT Pocket Reform colours" />

Note that when you view the image in another tab, it’ll be a negative:
purple grass instead of green grass. The
<a href="2024-06-07-leukerbad-3.jpg">original</a> is what I used before
coming up with the image above.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Project 2025, the controversial playbook and policy agenda for a
right-wing presidential administration, has lost its director and faced
scathing criticism from both Democratic groups and former President
Donald Trump. But Project 2025’s plan to train an army of political
appointees who could battle against the so-called deep state government
bureaucracy on behalf of a future Trump administration remains on
track.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s not hyperbole to look at these as training videos to enact a
heavily right-wing America: one that is subject to Christian nationalist
ideas and seeks to squash dissent. They discuss how to eliminate climate
change protections and erase decades of progress on race and gender.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, it’s a fascinating view on a movement that, regardless of
your political views, clearly seeks to re-make America. In that sense
they’re a little like something from a Philip K Dick novel - or, dare I
say it, the Handmaid’s Tale.

not the first student uprising to help bring about radical change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BANGKOK — In Bangladesh, weeks of protests against a quota system for
government jobs turned into a broad uprising that forced the prime
minister to flee the country and resign.</p>
<p>The demonstrations began peacefully last month and were primarily led
by students frustrated with the system that they said favored those with
connections to the ruling party.</p>
<p>But it turned violent on July 15 as student protesters clashed with
security officials and pro-government activists. Former Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina fled this week after the unrest during which nearly 300
people died, including both students and police officers.</p>
<p>Students or other young people have frequently played pivotal roles
in popular uprisings that have brought down governments or forced them
to change policies. Here are some other major cases:</p>
<p>Gota Go Gama protests in Sri Lanka</p>
<p>Like in Bangladesh, widespread protests in Sri Lanka in 2022 were
able to bring down a government, and youth played a key role.</p>
<p>Scattered demonstrations turned into months-long protests starting in
March 2022 as an economic crisis worsened in the Indian Ocean island
nation, leading to a shortage of fuel, cooking gas and other essentials
as well as an extended power outage.</p>
<p>In April, protesters primarily led by university students and other
young people occupied an esplanade adjoining President Gotabaya
Rajapaksa’s office in the capital Colombo, demanding he and his
government resign.</p>
<p>More people joined daily, setting up a tent camp dubbed “Gota Go
Gama,” or “Gota Go Village,” a play on Gotabaya’s nickname “Gota.”</p>
<p>The protest site was peaceful, with organizers offering free food,
water, toilets and even medical care for people. Camp leaders, many of
whom were university students, held daily media briefings and made
regular speeches, while the crowd was entertained by bands and
plays.</p>
<p>The government reacted by imposing a curfew, declaring a state of
emergency, allowing the military to arrest civilians and restricting
access to social media, but were unable to stop the protest.</p>
<p>Under pressure, many ministers resigned but President Rajapaksa and
his older brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa remained.</p>
<p>In May, Rajapaksa supporters attacked the protest camp, drawing
widespread condemnation from across the country and forcing Prime
Minister Rajapaksa to resign.</p>
<p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa clung to power until July, when protesters stormed
his official residence, forcing him to flee the country. After taking
temporary refuge in the Maldives, Rajapaksa later resigned.</p>
<p>His successor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, in one of his first moves as new
president ousted protesters from occupied government buildings and shut
down their camp, dismantling their tents in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The situation has since calmed, and Wickremesinghe has been able to
address the shortages of food, fuel and medicine and restore power.</p>
<p>Complaints continue, however, about the rise in taxes and electric
bills that are part of the new government’s efforts to meet
International Monetary Fund loan conditions. Former Prime Minister
Rajapaksa’s son Namal Rajapaksa will be running in the presidential
elections this September.</p>
<p>Athens Polytechnic uprising in Greece</p>
<p>In November 1973, students at Athens Polytechnic university rose up
against the military junta that ruled Greece with an iron fist for more
than six years.</p>
<p>Military officers seized power in a 1967 coup, establishing a
dictatorship marked by the arrest, exile and torture of its political
opponents.</p>
<p>The regime’s brutality and hardline rule gave rise to a growing
opposition, particularly among students, culminating in the November
uprising.</p>
<p>The protest began peacefully on November 14, with students staging a
strike at the Athens Polytechnic university and occupying the campus. By
the next day, thousands from around Athens had joined in to support the
students and the demonstrations grew, as did calls to end the
dictatorship.</p>
<p>On November 17, the military crushed the revolt when a tank smashed
through the university’s gates in the early hours of the day, killing
several students. The number of fatalities is still disputed, but at the
time the regime had announced 15 dead.</p>
<p>Days after the uprising, another military officer staged a coup and
implemented an even harsher regime. It was short lived however, after a
series of events led to a return to democracy in Greece, its birthplace,
in 1974.</p>
<p>A prosecutor’s report issued after the return to civilian government,
estimated fatalities at 34, but mentioned only 18 names. There were more
than 1,100 injured.</p>
<p>Today, annual marches in Athens to commemorate the pro-democracy
student uprising still attract thousands of people.</p>
<p>Kent State demonstrations in the United States</p>
<p>American students had long been protesting the U.S. involvement in
Vietnam when President Richard Nixon authorized attacks on neutral
Cambodia in April 1970, expanding the conflict in an attempt to
interrupt enemy supply lines.</p>
<p>On May 4, hundreds of students at Ohio’s Kent State University
gathered to protest the bombing of Cambodia, and authorities called in
the Ohio National Guard to disperse the crowd.</p>
<p>After failing to break up the protest with teargas, the National
Guard advanced and some opened fire on the crowd, killing four students
and wounding nine others.</p>
<p>The confrontation, sometimes referred to as the May 4 massacre, was a
defining moment for a nation sharply divided over the protracted
conflict, in which more than 58,000 Americans died.</p>
<p>It sparked a strike of 4 million students across the U.S.,
temporarily closing some 900 colleges and universities. The events also
played a pivotal role, historians argue, in turning public opinion
against the conflict in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Soweto Uprising in South Africa</p>
<p>In the decades-long struggle against white minority rule in South
Africa, a pivotal moment came in 1976 in the Soweto area of
Johannesburg.</p>
<p>In a series of demonstrations starting June 16, Black students from
multiple schools took to the streets to protest against being forced to
study in Afrikaans, the Dutch-based language of the white rulers who
designed the system of racial oppression known as apartheid.</p>
<p>The protests spread to other areas in South Africa, becoming a
flashpoint for anger at a system that denied adequate education, the
right to vote and other basic rights to the country’s Black
majority.</p>
<p>Hundreds are estimated to have died in the government crackdown that
followed.</p>
<p>The bloodshed was epitomized by a photograph of a dying student,
Hector Pieterson. The image of his limp body being carried by another
teenager was seen around the world and galvanized international efforts
to end South Africa’s racial segregation, though apartheid would linger
for nearly two more decades.</p>
<p>South Africa achieved democracy with majority rule elections in 1994
and today June 16 is a national holiday.</p>
<p>Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>As the Communist governments of Eastern Europe teetered in 1989,
widespread demonstrations broke out in Czechoslovakia after riot police
suppressed a student protest in Prague on November 17.</p>
<p>On November 20 as the anti-Communist protests grew, the students
being joined by scores of others and some 500,000 took to the streets of
Prague.</p>
<p>Dubbed the “Velvet Revolution” for its non-violent nature, the
protests led to the resignation of the Communist Party’s leadership on
November 28.</p>
<p>By December 10, Czechoslovakia had a new government and on December
29, Vaclav Havel, a dissident playwright who had spent several years in
prison, was elected the country’s first democratic president in a half
century by a parliament still dominated by communist hard-liners.</p>
<p>In 1992, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into two countries, the
Czech Republic and Slovakia.</p>

id="how-mauis-151-year-old-banyan-tree-is-coming-back-to-life-after-fire">How
Maui’s 151-year-old banyan tree is coming back to life after fire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAHAINA, Hawaii — When a deadly wildfire tore through Lahaina on Maui
last August, the wall of flames scorched the 151-year-old banyan tree
along the historic town’s Front Street. But the sprawling tree survived
the blaze, and thanks to the efforts of arborists and dedicated
volunteers, parts of it are growing back — and even thriving.</p>
<p>One year after the fire, here’s what to know about the banyan tree
and the efforts to restore it.</p>
<p>Why is Lahaina’s banyan tree significant?</p>
<p>The banyan tree is the oldest living one on Maui but is not a species
indigenous to the Hawaiian Islands. India shipped the tree as a gift to
commemorate the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the first Protestant
missionaries to live in Lahaina. It was planted in 1873, a quarter
century before the Hawaiian Islands became a U.S. territory and seven
decades after King Kamehameha declared Lahaina the capital of his
kingdom.</p>
<p>The tree is widely beloved and fondly remembered by millions of
tourists who have visited Maui over the years. But for many others it is
a symbol of colonial rule that has dispossessed Native Hawaiians of
their land and suppressed their language and culture.</p>
<p>For generations, the banyan tree served as a gathering place along
Lahaina’s waterfront. By many accounts, it was the heart of the
oceanside community — towering more than 18 meters (60 feet) high and
anchored by multiple trunks that span nearly an acre.</p>
<p>The enormous tree has leafy branches that unfurl majestically and
offer shade from the sun. Aerial roots dangle from its boughs and
eventually latch onto the soil to become new trunks. Branches splay out
widely and have become roosting places for choirs of birds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What happened to it during the fire?</p>
<p>The 2023 fire charred the tree and blackened many of its leaves. But
it wasn’t the flames so much as the intense heat that dried out much of
the tree, according to Duane Sparkman, chair of the Maui County Arborist
Committee. As a result of this loss of moisture, about half of the
tree’s branches died, he said.</p>
<p>“Once that section of the tree desiccated, there was no coming back,”
he said.</p>
<p>But other parts of the tree are now growing back healthy.</p>
<p>How was it saved?</p>
<p>Those working to restore the tree removed the dead branches so that
the tree’s energy would go toward the branches that were alive, Sparkman
said.</p>
<p>To monitor that energy, 14 sensors were screwed into the tree to
track the flows of cambium, or sap, through its branches.</p>
<p>“It’s basically a heart monitor,” Sparkman said. “As we’ve been
treating the tree, the heartbeat’s getting stronger and stronger and
stronger.”</p>
<p>Sparkman said there are also plans to install vertical tubes to help
the tree’s aerial roots, which appear to be vertical branches that grow
down toward the ground. The tubes will contain compost to provide the
branches with key nutrients when they take root in the soil.</p>
<p>A planned irrigation system will also feed small drops of water into
the tubes. The goal, Sparkman said, is to help those aerial roots “bulk
up and become the next stabilizer root.” The system will also irrigate
the surrounding land and the tree’s canopy.</p>
<p>“You see a lot of long, long branches with hundreds of leaves back on
the tree,” Sparkman said, adding that some branches are even producing
fruit. “It’s pretty amazing to see that much of the tree come back.”</p>
<p>What other trees were destroyed in the fire?</p>
<p>Sparkman estimates that Lahaina lost some 25,000 trees in the
fire.</p>
<p>These included the fruit trees that people grew in their yards as
well as trees that are significant in Hawaiian culture, such as the ulu
or breadfruit tree; the fire charred all but two of the dozen or so that
remained.</p>
<p>Since the blaze, a band of arborists, farmers and landscapers —
including Sparkman — has set about trying to save the ulu and other
culturally important trees. Before colonialism, commercial agriculture
and tourism, thousands of breadfruit trees dotted Lahaina.</p>
<p>To help restore Lahaina’s trees, Sparkman founded a nonprofit called
Treecovery. The group has potted some 3,500 trees, he said, growing them
in “micro-nurseries” across the island, including at some hotels, until
people can move back into their homes.</p>
<p>“We have grow hubs all over the island of Maui to grow these trees
out for as long as they need. So, when the people are ready, we can have
them come pick these trees up and they can plant them in their yards,”
he said. “It’s important that we do this for the families.”</p>

<h2 id="nncp-setup-automation">2024-08-09 NNCP setup automation</h2>

<h1 id="2024-08-09-nncp-setup-automation">
2024-08-09 NNCP setup automation
</h1>
<p>
This is a continuation of <a href="2024-07-16-minimal-nncp-setup">the
minimal NNCP setup to get started</a>. Once we verified that everything
works as expected with manual invocations, the next step is automation.
There are two options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Enable all the services. This makes sense if you expect a lot of
traffic.
</li>
<li>
Only call the executables every now and then. This makes sense if you
expect very little traffic.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you want to enable all the services, the <code>examples</code>
directory has service definitions for you. Running
<code>nncp-caller</code> only makes sense if there is at least one entry
in your <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> that has a <code>cron</code> key.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-daemon.service
sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl enable /usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/nncp-toss.service
sudo systemctl start nncp-daemon.service 
sudo systemctl start nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl start nncp-toss.service 
sudo systemctl status nncp-daemon.service 
sudo systemctl status nncp-caller.service
sudo systemctl status nncp-toss.service 
</code></pre>
<p>
I don’t expect a lot of NNCP traffic. This is why my setup on the laptop
and server uses the alternative.
</p>
<p>
In order to conserve resources, you could decide not to have these
services running all the time. I’m doing this for two reasons: I don’t
want to upgrade the virtual machine I’m renting. It’s a point of pride
to do much with very little. From the perspective of impeding collapse,
I also think that we should all get on board with
<a href="https://wimvanderbauwhede.codeberg.page/articles/frugal-computing-developer/">frugal
computing</a>
(<a class="account" href="https://scholar.social/@wim_v12e" title="@wim_v12e@scholar.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="wim_v12e">@wim_v12e</span></a>).
</p>
<p>
Ready for some frugal computing? Here we go.
</p>
<p>
Run the daemon on the server. That is, if other sites know your internet
address and call you, then you need this. My laptop does not but my
server does. When somebody calls the server on port 5400, start the
<code>nncp-daemon</code> using <code>inetd</code> (from the
<code>openbsd-inet</code> or the <code>inetutils-inetd</code> packages
on Debian).
</p>
<p>
In your <code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> file:
</p>
<pre><code>5400 stream  tcp nowait  nncp    /usr/bin/nncp-daemon    nncp-daemon -quiet -ucspi
</code></pre>
<p>
Run <code>nncp-call</code> every hour or every day from cron for the
systems you want to call. Those systems don’t need a <code>cron</code>
key in the <code>/etc/nncp.hjson</code> file.
</p>
<p>
This is my laptop calling my server every hour, via
<code>/etc/cron.hourly/nncp</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-call ]; then
        su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-call -noprogress sibirocobombus&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p>
This is on the laptop, for my neighbours <code>erebor</code> and
<code>quux</code> in <code>/etc/cron.daily/nncp</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-call ]; then
    for neighbour in erebor quux; do
        su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-call -noprogress $neighbour&quot;
    done
fi
</code></pre>
<p>
This is for the server, tossing stuff once per hour, via
<code>/etc/cron.hourly/nncp</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh
if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-toss ]; then
    su nncp -s /bin/sh -c &quot;/usr/bin/nncp-toss&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p>
Adding <code>autotoss: true</code> only helps for the system calling
others. On the server, tossing needs to happen on a regular basis.
</p>
<p>
Finally, you can do some clean-up by copying
<code>/usr/share/doc/nncp/examples/cron-daily-nncp</code> to
<code>/etc/cron.daily/nncp-cleanup</code>.
</p>
<p>
I’m using the following, both on the laptop and the server:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

if [ -x /usr/bin/nncp-rm ]; then
    for TYPE in part seen hdr area; do
            su nncp -s /bin/bash -c &quot;nncp-rm -quiet -all -older 7d -$TYPE&quot;
    done
    su nncp -s /bin/bash -c &quot;nncp-rm -quiet -tmp -older 7d&quot;
fi
</code></pre>

ambassador confirms Mexican drug lord was brought to US against his
will</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — The U.S. ambassador to Mexico confirmed Friday that
drug lord Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada was brought to the United States
against his will when he arrived in Texas in July on a plane along with
fellow drug lord Joaquín Guzmán López.</p>
<p>Zambada’s attorney had earlier claimed the longtime chief of the
Sinaloa cartel had been kidnapped. But officials had not confirmed that,
and Zambada’s age and apparent ill-health had led some to speculate he
turned himself in.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Ken Salazar on Friday said, “the evidence we saw … is
that they had brought El Mayo Zambada against his will.”</p>
<p>“This was an operation between cartels, where one turned the other
one in,” Salazar said. Zambada’s faction of the Sinaloa cartel has been
engaged in fierce fighting with another faction, led by the sons of
imprisoned drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. Guzmán López is the
half-brother of the factional leaders.</p>
<p>Salazar said no U.S. personnel, resources or aircraft were involved
in the flight on which Guzmán López turned himself in, and that U.S.
officials were “surprised” when the two showed up at an airport outside
El Paso, Texas on July 25.</p>
<p>Frank Pérez, Zambada’s attorney, said in a statement in July that “my
client neither surrendered nor negotiated any terms with the U.S.
government.”</p>
<p>“Joaquín Guzmán López forcibly kidnapped my client,” Pérez wrote. “He
was ambushed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed by six men in
military uniforms and Joaquin. His legs were tied, and a black bag was
placed over his head.”</p>
<p>Pérez went on to say that Zambada, 76, was thrown in the back of a
pickup truck, forced onto a plane and tied to the seat by Guzmán
López.</p>
<p>In early August, Zambada made his second appearance in federal court
in Texas after being taken into U.S. custody the week before.</p>
<p>Guzmán López had apparently long been in negotiations with U.S.
authorities about possibly turning himself in. Guzmán López, 38, has
pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges in federal
court in Chicago.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials said they had almost no warning when Guzmán
López’s plane landed at an airport near El Paso. Both men were arrested
and remain jailed. They are charged in the U.S. with various drug
crimes.</p>
<p>Salazar said the plane had taken off from Sinaloa — the Pacific coast
state where the cartel is headquartered — and had filed no flight plan.
He stressed the pilot wasn’t American, nor was the plane.</p>
<p>The implication is that Guzmán López intended to turn himself in and
brought Zambada with him to procure more favorable treatment, but his
motives remain unclear.</p>
<p>Zambada was thought to be more involved in day-to-day operations of
the cartel than his better-known and flashier boss, “El Chapo,” who was
sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. in 2019.</p>
<p>Zambada is charged in a number of U.S. cases, including in New York
and California. Prosecutors brought a new indictment against him in New
York in February, describing him as the “principal leader of the
criminal enterprise responsible for importing enormous quantities of
narcotics into the United States.”</p>
<p>The capture of Zambada and Guzmán López — and the idea that one
cartel faction had turned in the leader of the other — raised fears that
the already divided cartel could descend into a spiral of violent
infighting.</p>
<p>That prompted Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to take
the unusual step of issuing a public appeal to drug cartels not to fight
each other.</p>

<p>NEW YORK — Renowned French high-wire artist Philippe Petit marked the
50th anniversary of his famous walk between New York’s Twin Towers with
a performance in a Manhattan cathedral, accompanied by live music from
Sting.</p>
<p>Petit walked between the spires of the World Trade Center
skyscrapers, 1,350 feet up, on August 7, 1974.</p>
<p>A photographer captured the feat with the New York skyline in the
background as Petit — without a harness — made the crossing.</p>
<p>Now 74 years old, Petit partly re-created his gravity-defying stunt
Thursday in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, about seven miles
north of the former Twin Towers, which were destroyed in the attacks of
September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>“Of course, my illegal walk between the towers was the most important
moment of my life at the time, and now I look back and I have done
something like 100 high wire walks all over the world,” Petit told
AFP.</p>
<p>In the reconstruction, Petit was met by a police officer as he
completed his walk.</p>
<p>The New York Times, which called Petit’s Twin Towers walk the “art
crime of the century,” reported that in 1974 after 45 minutes of “knee
bends and other stunts,” Petit turned himself over to waiting
police.</p>
<p>He was charged with disorderly conduct and trespass, but the charges
were dropped in return for a free aerial performance in a city park.</p>
<p>The feature film The Walk, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and the
Oscar-winning documentary Man on Wire tell the story of the famous
stunt.</p>

id="us-election-looms-over-us-south-korea-japan-security-cooperation">US
election looms over US-South Korea-Japan security cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Experts in Washington are split on their perspectives of
the durability of the recently elevated U.S.-South Korea-Japan security
cooperation in the event of former President Donald Trump winning the
November U.S. presidential election, given his critical stance toward
U.S. alliances in the past.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S., South Korea and Japan signed a memorandum of
cooperation on the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework (TSCF),
which is aimed at institutionalizing the countries’ security partnership
against threats from China and North Korea.</p>
<p>While not legally binding, the memorandum is expected to facilitate
trilateral security cooperation regardless of any leadership changes in
their respective countries.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for regular high-level talks, joint exercises and
other exchanges among the three nations.</p>
<p>Some in Washington, however, question whether the United States,
South Korea and Japan would successfully institutionalize the enhanced
security cooperation in a second Trump presidency.</p>
<p>“Certainly, the greatest and near-term concern is if President Trump
is reelected, whether he would undo some of the progress of recent
years,” Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the
Heritage Foundation, told VOA Korean by telephone Wednesday.</p>
<p>Klingner added that the three governments hoped that signing the
memorandum would regularize and operationalize the ongoing security
improvements among the three nations.</p>
<p>The Biden administration says stronger trilateral cooperation is an
integral part of its Indo-Pacific strategy.</p>
<p>The administration also has been touting the August 2023 summit at
Camp David with the U.S., South Korea and Japan as a historic meeting,
saying the three leaders “inaugurated a new era of trilateral
partnership” there.</p>
<p>In a Washington Post opinion piece published this week, Secretary of
State Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and White House
national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the U.S. security
partnership in the Indo-Pacific region is working more effectively than
before, citing the cooperation among the United States, South Korea and
Japan as an example.</p>
<p>“President [Joe] Biden brought together Japan and South Korea — two
countries with a difficult history — to join the United States in the
Camp David Trilateral Summit, spurring unprecedented defense and
economic cooperation among our countries,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Uncertainty looms</p>
<p>It is uncertain how the U.S. trilateral partnership with South Korea
and Japan would shape up if Trump returns to power, as the former
president has not publicly articulated a stance on the trilateral
cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Trump has put strong emphasis on U.S. allies paying their “fair
share” of defense costs.</p>
<p>During his presidency, Trump demanded that South Korea and Japan pay
more for the cost of the U.S. military presence in their countries. He
warned the U.S. could withdraw its troops unless the demands were
met.</p>
<p>Michael O’Hanlon, director of foreign policy research at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, told VOA Korean via email Wednesday
that it would be hard to predict whether the TSCF would survive a
possible Trump second term.</p>
<p>“Most things are personalized with him, or they relate to his
instincts and impressions based on previous business dealings,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Both the leaders [of South Korea and Japan] he dealt with when
president are now gone. So, it’s a wild card or blank slate.”</p>
<p>However, some disagree.</p>
<p>Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the
George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean by telephone Thursday
that Trump would likely allow the institutionalization of the TSCF,
considering the strong support from both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>“I find the majority [of] members on Capitol Hill are very positive
to it,” Armitage said.</p>
<p>“I do notice that some of the people who are rumored to be coming in,
should Mr. Trump win, are actually quite international in their
outlook,” he added, declining to say who those people are.</p>
<p>Alliance commitment</p>
<p>Frederick Fleitz, who served as chief of staff of the National
Security Council in the Trump White House, told VOA Korean by phone
Wednesday that he would expect the agreement on the security framework
among the U.S. and the two U.S. allies in Asia to be upheld in a second
Trump administration.</p>
<p>“It’s going to remain,” Fleitz said. “He [Trump] is a strong
supporter of alliances, particularly our alliance in the Asian
Pacific.”</p>
<p>Fleitz added that the stronger security ties among the three
countries is “a significant achievement that’s going to continue.”</p>
<p>Evans Revere, who served as acting assistant secretary of state for
East Asia and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean via email that China’s
rise to become the greatest threat in the Indo-Pacific theater is a fact
not to be ignored by any of the three countries.</p>
<p>“There is every reason to believe the three countries can effectively
institutionalize trilateral security cooperation, even if there is a
change of administration in one or more of the three capitals,” Revere
said. “There is a growing perception in all three countries of the
threats and challenges they share in common. China’s attempts at
political, military and economic intimidation are becoming more
frequent.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running to become the
successor to Biden, is widely predicted to continue on the path Biden
forged.</p>
<p>“Harris does not have a clearly established record on U.S.-South
Korea-Japan security cooperation, but I expect that she will follow the
policies of the Biden administration on this issue,” Gary Samore, former
White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction
during the Obama administration, told VOA Korean via email.</p>
<p>Blinken, Austin and Sullivan highlighted in the Post opinion piece
that the transformed approach toward the Indo-Pacific region is “one of
the most important and least-told stories of the foreign policy strategy
advanced by President Biden and Vice President Harris.”</p>

gets HTTP server, wget, UEFI improvements, and much more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>In line with the release of the COSMIC alpha, parts of which are also
available for Redox, we’ve got another monthly update for the Rust-based
operating system. First, in what in hindsight seems like a logical step,
Redox is joining hands with Servo, the Rust-based browser engine, and
they proposed focus will be on Servo’s cross-compilation support and a
font stack written in Rust. It definitely makes sense for these two
projects to work together in some way, and I hope there can be more
cross-pollination in the future. Simple HTTP Server, an HTTP server
written in Rust, has been ported to Redox, and the Apache port is
getting some work, too. Wget now works on Redox, and several bugs in
COSMIC programs were squashed. UEFI also saw some work, including fixing
a violation of the EUFI specification, as well as adding several
workarounds for buggy firmware, which should increase the number of
machines that can boot Redox. Another area of progress is self-hosting,
and Redox can now compile hello world-programs in Rust, C and C++ – an
important step towards compiling more complex programs and the end-goal
of compiling Redox itself on Redox. There’s way more in this update, so
head on over to get the full details.</p>

id="us-to-lift-ban-on-offensive-weapons-sales-to-saudi-arabia-sources-say">US
to lift ban on offensive weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Biden administration has decided to lift a ban on
U.S. sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia, three sources familiar
with the matter told Reuters on Friday, reversing a three-year-old
policy to pressure the kingdom to wind down the Yemen war.</p>
<p>The administration briefed Congress this week on its decision to lift
the ban, a congressional aide said. One source said sales could resume
as early as next week, while another said deliberations on timing were
still under way.</p>
<p>“The Saudis have met their end of the deal, and we are prepared to
meet ours, returning these cases to regular order through appropriate
congressional notification and consultation,” a senior Biden
administration official said.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, major international weapons deals must be reviewed by
members of Congress before they are made final.</p>
<p>Democratic and Republican lawmakers have questioned the provision of
offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia in recent years, citing issues
including the toll on civilians of its campaign in Yemen and a range of
human rights concerns.</p>
<p>But that opposition has softened amid turmoil in the Middle East
following Hamas’ deadly October 7 terror attack on Israel and because of
changes in the conduct of the campaign in Yemen.</p>
<p>The threat level in the region has been heightened since late last
month, with Iran and Lebanon’s powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah group
vowing to retaliate against Israel after Hamas’ political chief Ismail
Haniyeh was killed in Tehran.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also has been negotiating a defense pact and
an agreement for civil nuclear cooperation with Riyadh as part of a
broad deal that envisions Saudi Arabia normalizing ties with Israel,
although that remains an elusive goal.</p>
<p>Since March 2022 — when the Saudis and Houthis entered into a
U.N.-led truce — there have not been any Saudi airstrikes in Yemen and
cross-border fire from Yemen into the kingdom has largely stopped, the
administration official said.</p>
<p>Biden adopted the tougher stance on weapons sales to Saudi Arabia in
2021, citing the kingdom’s campaign against the Iran-aligned Houthis in
Yemen, which has inflicted heavy civilian casualties.</p>
<p>Yemen’s war is seen as one of several proxy battles between Iran and
Saudi Arabia. The Houthis ousted a Saudi-backed government from Sanaa in
late 2014 and have been at war against a Saudi-led military alliance
since 2015, a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people
and left 80% of Yemen’s population dependent on humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>“We are regularly conducting airstrikes to degrade Houthi
capabilities, an effort that is ongoing and will continue together with
a coalition of partners,” the senior U.S. administration official
said.</p>
<p>“We have designated the Houthis as Specially Designated Global
Terrorists, and we will have imposed sanctions and additional costs on
the Houthi smuggling networks and military apparatus. This pressure will
continue to build over the coming weeks,” the official said.</p>

id="rioter-who-attacked-police-at-us-capitol-gets-20-year-sentence">Rioter
who attacked police at US Capitol gets 20-year sentence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A California man with a history of political violence
was sentenced on Friday to 20 years in prison for repeatedly attacking
police with flagpoles and other makeshift weapons during the Jan. 6,
2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>David Nicholas Dempsey’s sentence is one of the longest among
hundreds of Capitol riot prosecutions. Prosecutors described him as one
of the most violent members of the mob of Donald Trump supporters that
attacked the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden’s 2020
presidential election victory.</p>
<p>Dempsey, who is from Van Nuys, stomped on police officers’ heads. He
swung poles at officers defending a tunnel, struck an officer in the
head with a metal crutch and attacked police with pepper spray and
broken pieces of furniture, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>He climbed atop other rioters, using them like “human scaffolding” to
reach officers guarding a tunnel entrance. He injured at least two
police officers, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>“Your conduct on January 6th was exceptionally egregious,” U.S.
District Judge Royce Lamberth told Dempsey. “You did not get carried
away in the moment.”</p>
<p>Dempsey pleaded guilty in January to two counts of assaulting police
officers with a dangerous weapon.</p>
<p>Only former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio has received a longer
sentence in the January 6 attack. Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years for
orchestrating a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump
to Biden after the 2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>Dempsey called his conduct “reprehensible” and apologized to the
police officers whom he assaulted. “You were performing your duties, and
I responded with hostility and violence,” he said before learning his
sentence.</p>
<p>Justice Department prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of 21
years and 10 months for Dempsey, a former construction worker and
fast-food restaurant employee. Dempsey’s violence was so extreme that he
attacked a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him, prosecutors
wrote.</p>
<p>“David Dempsey is political violence personified,” Assistant U.S.
Attorney Douglas Brasher told the judge.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Amy Collins, who sought a sentence of 6 years and
six months, described the government’s sentencing recommendation as
“ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“It makes him a statistic,” she said. “It doesn’t consider the person
he is, how much he has grown.”</p>
<p>Dempsey was wearing a tactical vest, a helmet and an American flag
gaiter covering his face when he attacked police at a tunnel leading to
the Lower West Terrace doors. He shot pepper spray at Metropolitan
Police Department Detective Phuson Nguyen just as another rioter yanked
at the officer’s gas mask, prosecutors wrote.</p>
<p>“The searing spray burned Detective Nguyen’s lungs, throat, eyes, and
face and left him gasping for breath, fearing he might lose
consciousness and be overwhelmed by the mob,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Dempsey then struck MPD Sergeant Jason Mastony in the head with a
metal crutch, cracking the shield on his gas mask and cutting his
head.</p>
<p>“I collapsed and caught myself against the wall as my ears rang. I
was able to stand again and hold the line for a few more minutes until
another assault by rioters pushed the police line back away from the
threshold of the tunnel,” Mastony said in a statement submitted to the
court.</p>
<p>Dempsey has been jailed since his arrest in August 2021.</p>
<p>His criminal record in California includes convictions for burglary,
theft and assault. The assault conviction stemmed from an October 2019
gathering near the Santa Monica Pier, where Dempsey attacked people
peacefully demonstrating against then-President Trump, prosecutors
said.</p>
<p>“The peaceful protest turned violent as Dempsey took a canister of
bear spray from his pants and dispersed it at close range against
several protesters,” they wrote, noting that Dempsey was sentenced to
200 days of jail time.</p>
<p>Dempsey engaged in at least three other acts of “vicious political
violence” that didn’t lead to criminal charges “for various reasons,”
according to prosecutors. They said Dempsey struck a counterprotester
over the head with a skateboard at a June 2019 rally in Los Angeles,
used the same skateboard to assault someone at an August 2020 protest in
Tujunga, California, and attacked a protester with pepper spray and a
metal bat during an August 2020 protest in Beverly Hills,
California.</p>
<p>More than 1,400 people have been charged with January 6-related
federal crimes. Over 900 of them have been convicted and sentenced, with
roughly two-thirds receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from a few
days to Tarrio’s 22 years.</p>

<h2 id="las-vegas-journalist-murder-trial-to-begin-monday">Las Vegas
journalist murder trial to begin Monday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The trial of a former elected official in Nevada accused
of murdering an investigative journalist in 2022 is set to begin on
Monday in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Jeff German, a longtime reporter at The Las Vegas Review-Journal, was
found stabbed to death outside his suburban home on September 3,
2022.</p>
<p>Former Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles, 47, is
charged with open murder, meaning he could be found guilty of first- or
second-degree murder or manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>German, 69, reported extensively on alleged mismanagement in Telles’
office. When Telles then lost a reelection bid in 2022, he posted a
letter online in which he attacked the Review-Journal for its
coverage.</p>
<p>“German’s killing was really shocking to the whole press freedom
community, to the world of media,” Clayton Weimers, who heads the U.S.
bureau of Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, told VOA. “Accountability
in this crime is essential to demonstrate that no one can intimidate,
threaten or hurt a journalist because they don’t like the coverage
they’re getting.”</p>
<p>Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday. The judge will also
consider a renewed request for dismissal from Telles.</p>
<p>Telles has indicated that he wants the trial to begin as soon as
possible. He has spent months hiring and firing different lawyers and
even served as his own attorney for a period, according to media
reports.</p>
<p>His two requests to remove the judge from the case over claims that
she was biased have failed.</p>
<p>“He wants to proceed to trial, wants to have his day in court,”
Robert Draskovich, the current attorney for Telles, told reporters
outside court on Wednesday. “He’s been fairly adamant since the get-go
that he wants to tell his story.”</p>
<p>Journalist killings are rare in the United States. Data from the New
York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, shows that 17
journalists and media workers have been killed in the U.S. since the
watchdog started keeping records in 1992. Of those, the CPJ has said it
believes 15 cases — including German’s — were in relation to the
journalist’s work.</p>
<p>“German is the only journalist suspected of having been killed by a
politician in the United States since CPJ began keeping record,”
Katherine Jacobsen, the U.S. and Canada program coordinator at CPJ, told
VOA.</p>
<p>“It’s really important that any time a journalist is assaulted or
killed, that the perpetrator is held responsible,” Jacobsen, who is
based in Washington, said.</p>
<p>“This sends a very clear message to both those who might have
committed the crime that it’s not OK, and also to any would-be
perpetrators of crimes against journalists that there are very real
consequences and that they should think twice before harming reporters,”
she said.</p>
<p>Impunity in journalist killings is a global problem. Nearly 80% of
journalist killings over the past decade remain unsolved, CPJ reported
in 2023.</p>
<p>German’s case has had sweeping press freedom implications for the
U.S.</p>
<p>As part of the investigation into his killing, city police seized the
reporter’s cell phone and computers in a move that the Review-Journal
said was unlawful.</p>
<p>The Review-Journal argued that since German’s devices could also
contain sensitive information, such as the names of confidential sources
or unpublished information, independent hearing masters should first
review the devices.</p>
<p>Press freedom groups were concerned that if police were given
unrestricted access to German’s devices, it could set a legal precedent
allowing journalists’ private source material to be accessed after they
are killed.</p>
<p>“We need a better sense of awareness from law enforcement officials
of the sensitivities of investigating a crime against the journalist,”
said Weimers, who is based in Washington.</p>
<p>“It needs to be very, very clear for law enforcement that they need
to respect the confidentiality of journalistic sources. It has a
profound chilling effect on the work of investigative journalists like
Jeff German if they’re not able to safely communicate with their
sources,” Weimers said.</p>
<p>Nevada’s Supreme Court in October 2023 ruled in favor of shielding
German’s devices from an unchecked police search.</p>
<p>“Jeff would be very happy with this decision,” Glenn Cook, the
Review-Journal’s executive editor, told VOA after the ruling was
announced. “Jeff would be appalled if he thought his death could
compromise the sources that he held so closely.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty in this case. But if
convicted, Telles could spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p>

<h2 id="maui-after-the-fire">Maui After the Fire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
On August 9, 2023, the smoke finally cleared in Lahaina.
</p>
<p>
The scene was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/maui-fires-what-caused-where?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" target="_self"><u>shocking</u></a>.
In the course of just
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/08/hawaii-wildfires-timeline-maui-lahaina-dg/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
few hours</u></a> on the afternoon of August 8, winds had fanned a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/grass-fires-wildfires-maui-marshall" target="_self"><u>dry
grass fire</u></a> on the northwest coast of Maui into an inferno that
trapped fleeing residents and left
<a href="https://www.kitv.com/news/lahaina/lives-lost-in-lahaina-all-of-the-people-who-perished-in-the-maui-fire/article_3b8e91ba-4122-11ee-a3f2-b73625af4d58.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 100 people dead</u></a> and the city in ashes. “We understand that
recovery will take years,” Kaniela Ing, the national director of
<a href="https://www.greennewdealnetwork.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Green New Deal Network</u></a> and a seventh-generation Indigenous
Hawaiian, told me when we spoke in the immediate aftermath of the
tragedy. “And as that recovery unfolds, we want to make sure that the
people, the communities, are actually empowered to rebuild themselves —
that we don’t open the door for disaster capitalists.”
</p>
<p>
Since then, Ing and other community leaders have put in the work. Over
the past year, their group,
<a href="https://wearelahainastrong.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lahaina
Strong</u></a>, has tried to empower the community and challenge the
power structures they say contributed to the confluence of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/how-invasive-plants-fueled-an-inferno-in-maui" target="_self"><u>factors</u></a>
that made the fire possible.
</p>
<p>
“We’re all about the community arm — grassroots power, and coalitions,”
he told me this week. “Unfortunately, our groups are the same groups
that have had to respond to climate disasters like Hurricanes Maria,
Harvey, Sandy, and the Paradise fires. There’s always something, and
it’s getting more and more frequent.”
</p>
<p>
On the anniversary of the fire, I spoke to Ing about how other
communities can learn from the Lahaina model, the victories organizers
secured to ensure a better future for native Hawaiians and locals, and
how to ride the momentum forward into November. Our conversation has
been condensed and edited for clarity and brevity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>It’s been almost a year since
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/kaniela-ing-interview-maui-fire" target="_self"><u><strong>we
last spoke</strong></u></a><strong>; at that time, you’d just arrived in
Maui from your home on Oahu after the fire. What happened after
that?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t think there had been a clear model of best practices for how to
respond. So when [a climate disaster] happened in my backyard, it was
like, “Okay, let’s learn from all the responses and organizing
traditions that we’ve studied and been trained on” — from the Civil
Rights era to the mutual aid of the Black Panthers and tenant rights and
welfare organizers, to the modern efforts of the Alinsky-type
<a href="https://acorninternational.org/index.php/our-work/acorn-model/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ACORN
model</u></a>, to the Sunrise model, which is momentum-based. But how do
you draw from everything at once?
</p>
<p>
That is where Lahaina Strong came from. Because this is where I grew up,
we knew which community leaders would be stepping up. But it’s not
common for everyone to work together — they can be on different sides of
different issues. So we convened all of them — mostly those we call
<em><em>kupuna</em></em>, the older generation of elders. We started
coordinating the responses of our leaders and immigrant churches, the
heads of canoe clubs and governmental departments, Indigenous leaders,
and pro-surfers, because that’s what the community here looks like. And
what came of it was a few younger leaders — Millennials, so young for
our community — were given the elders’ blessing and told, “It’s time for
y’all to lead.”
</p>
<p>
There was Pa’ele [Kiakona], who was a server at a restaurant, and
Courtney [Lazo] and Jordan [Ruidas], who were expecting mothers, and
they’re the ones who really blew it up. I raised some money to get them
on a salary and train them, but they were already community leaders in
their own right. So the question was, “How do we maximize their power?”
</p>
<p>
The first thing we did was needs assessments. Everyone lived in a hotel,
but many of the more established charities were opening up in malls 13
or 14 miles away. But our team had iPads and lived in the hotels, too,
so while more established groups were getting 100 or so folks signed up,
we were getting thousands every day because they were neighbors.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Yeah, you have to be there.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Right, and they all knew each other. We were working on a team with
Salesforce — Marc Benioff was helping us back then — and we could figure
out people’s needs and direct them to services. There are <em><em>so
many </em></em>services, but people just lost their homes; they don’t
know where to go. So that was the job.
</p>
<p>
The last question was, “Would you want to get involved down the line
with the big decisions that the government will have to make about the
priorities of the rebuild?” So once the council started holding hearings
about the rebuilding and the policies of reopening and tourism, we were
able to turn out hundreds of people instantly. We seized the momentum.
We won unanimous support from the council for
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-maui-lahaina-wildfire-tourists-875e9113c6af7aa8d3d563093e5f920c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>delaying
the reopening of Lahaina to tourists</u></a>, and we did a big petition
delivery to the governor. The governor wasn’t supportive of us at the
time, though, and
<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2023/10/hawaii-governor-sticks-to-reopening-west-maui-to-tourists-next-week/#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20local%20activists,over%20the%20next%20few%20months." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>we
didn’t ultimately win</u></a> that one.
</p>
<p>
From there, it was, “What else do we need?” We needed to house people;
that was the main thing. There was also a government guy, Kaleo Manuel
[who had been on the state Commission on Water Resource Management until
a land developer
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/maui-fire-kaleo-manuel-water-official-removed-unfairly-rcna100974" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accused
him</u></a> of delaying water resources during the fire], who we
demanded to be reinstated, and we won that. We also had a demand for a
billion dollars in direct aid; we won that. But the housing thing was a
longer-term flight and went through the legislative session this year.
We did this thing called Fishing for Housing, which involved the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDM_sCaaOQU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>occupation
of Kā’anapali Beach</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>I saw
</strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C6iPn-mOP-g/?igsh=MW1hM2hwMG53dDVqcQ%3D%3D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>your
video</strong></u></a><strong> about that!</strong>
</p>
<p>
That occupation was rough because we lived on a really sandy beach. And
it was <em><em>big</em></em>. A lot of people came out. But the local
news covered it pretty much daily, and it raised a lot of sympathy. We
were educating tourists and raising money.
</p>
<p>
With that, we were able to form a historic partnership. Pa’ele’s uncle
is an activist who wants to return water from the hotels to the
communities and restore public streams. The unions generally don’t like
that kind of stuff in Hawaii, but we were able to bring in ILWU, the
hotel union here, and Local 5, another hotel union, which
<a href="https://www.ilwulocal142.org/ilwu-and-unite-here-local-5-pledge-cooperate-each-other-dealing-major-hotel-chains" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hadn’t
partnered with ILWU since 1940</u></a>. When we came to the legislative
session, it was like, “Okay, we have <em><em>real</em></em> power now.”
The governor came around and
<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2024/05/maui-mayor-takes-bold-step-to-eliminate-7000-short-term-rentals-by-2026/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>committed
to passing the bill</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Our theory was that we had to raise a ton of money for direct relief;
that was the most important thing, getting direct monetary aid to
people. But it was not going to be enough; we weren’t going to raise $10
billion. We could buy <em><em>one</em></em> house if we raised a million
and a half. Instead, we did this through a [501(c)4 social welfare
organization], where you can advocate and contest power where it
matters. And we were able to win 50,000 homes instead.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What’s next?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The next steps are on the climate front. The Inflation Reduction Act is
a good step; building and electricity, we’re also on track. Agriculture
and transportation on a national level are where we need to fill the
gaps. Why is Maui growing mono-crops like sugar and coffee for people
thousands of miles away? Why can’t we feed our own people? And
transportation — when the fires hit,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-traffic-jam-evacuation" target="_self"><u>everyone
was stuck</u></a> because of the one-way-in, one-way-out road. Those
issues are pertinent not only on the disaster, resiliency, and community
infrastructure levels, but also on the mitigation side.
</p>
<p>
People are also excited about the possibility of microgrids or
community-owned energy systems. When we initially had community hubs,
members were using Star Link or small solar systems, and locals were
like, “Wow, why can’t we do this everywhere?” It’d be way cheaper than
fixing the grid at this point.
</p>
<p>
We have a blank slate to build the future we need. And we’re going to be
up against a lot of powerful opponents in the next 10 years.
</p>
<p>
<strong>When we spoke last year, you talked about how rebuilding after
the fire was an opportunity to ensure that the people came first and
that the forces that contributed to the problem were pushed out of
power. Has that effort been successful?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s ongoing. Power has many forms: There are the institutional forms,
like CEOs and politicians, but there are the shadows — how ideas are
organized, industry association gatherings — that are harder to crack.
It’s a chess game, and we’re all trying to stay a step ahead.
</p>
<p>
I think that’s what is critical about our work. If we were to stop, if
we could no longer provide our organizers with salaries, they’d have to
go back to working two service jobs, and they wouldn’t have the time to
compete with full-time lobbyists.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You mentioned other climate disasters early in our conversation.
What advice would you give to people in other communities about
incorporating mutual aid and holding corporate powers accountable after
a catastrophe?</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you come out right away and say, “Hey, this is a climate disaster!”
then everyone is like, <em><em>Oh, an activist. </em></em>But if you
just come out and help and earn people’s trust — that’s what it really
takes. Listen to folks.
</p>
<p>
The thing about climate action and climate solutions is that they have
been so polarized over the last few years. I think it’s been moving in
our favor. Generally, the population supports us. But those who don’t
are much more vocal than they were 10 years ago, and that matters
because as soon as they start speaking up, the less political people are
just like, “Keep me out of this.” So we have to be careful about how we
approach these communities. They’re not thinking about climate; they’re
thinking about how to feed their family and how they will get their kids
to school or if school is even available. You have to meet them where
they are.
</p>
<p>
Then you go from there. You start to have conversations with them, and
they will support getting the polluters out and not being taken
advantage of by corporate utilities. You don’t have to talk to them
about climate like we always do among advocates; you shouldn’t. If you
want to build power in a community, you’ve got to have a different
approach. These people, their power is ultimately that they’re
survivors, not activists. The public doesn’t perceive them as having an
agenda other than just surviving and showing up for their community.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There’s still a lot of work to be done. How do you plan to keep
up the forward momentum heading into this fall and the election
season?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Visibility and outreach. There’s that old saying that politics is
downstream from culture, and our group has been really political,
especially during the legislative session. So we’re trying to show up
for the community in more direct ways. Today,
<a href="https://www.mauicounty.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=14692" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>we
paddled with the canoe clubs</u></a> to honor the first anniversary of
the fire. We’re showing up in these more community-based ways so we grow
in cultural power, too — not just as an advocacy group, but as a
holistic community.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you think anything has been missing from the media narrative
about Lahaina?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Some of the media that came out today was like, “A year later, people
are still without homes.” But if you look at the numbers, the per capita
investments from the federal government, and the commitment from FEMA —
I mean, it wasn’t great at first, I’ll admit that, but we’ve won quite a
bit. We’re <em><em>winning</em></em>. The momentum is on our side, and I
think it’s important for folks to understand that. They have to feel
like it’s worth it and that there’s hope to keep going. I know it’s not
the sexiest media narrative and it’s easier to draw criticism, but this
is the rise of self-determination. The survivors, to me, are the real
story.
</p>
<p>
And it’s going to take a long time. The fact that it’s like, “Oh, we
can’t rebuild a year later.” It was still toxic just a few months ago!
There’s debris everywhere. The focus should be less on charity and more
on the change and how the power structures have shifted. That’s been
really positive.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Do you feel optimistic about the Harris-Walz ticket heading into
this fall?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I do. Many reporters have asked me, “Why Harris and not Biden?” Politics
is all about coalitions; our movement did a lot of work to become part
of the Biden coalition, which was great. But Big Oil was also a part of
the coalition he needed to win, so there was always that tension, from
my perspective, during his presidency. But with Harris, we’ll have the
opportunity to build a dual coalition — perhaps with us and labor, and
not Big Oil.

in different “sections”. Commands are in section 1, which is why
documentation would sometimes refer to the command “foo” as
<strong>foo(1)</strong> because <strong>foo(5)</strong> might document
the file format or the config file that goes along with the command.
</p>
<p>
If that’s news to you, run <strong>man man</strong>. And if you find the
structure bewildering, read the manual on how to write manual pages:
<strong>man man-pages</strong> (section 7).
</p>
<p>
I’ve embraced man pages because when I write Perl code, I can put
documentation into the script such that when the script is installed, it
automatically works as its own man page – this works for
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-jupiter">jupiter</a>,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-BookmarkFeed">bookmark-feed</a> –
it also works for bigger projects, like
<a href="https://metacpan.org/dist/App-Phoebe">phoebe</a> where each
extension is also a Perl module and therefore also gets its own man
page.
</p>
<p>
For programming languages where the documentation is more focused on
documenting the code, things are different. Of course, there’s
<code>pydoc</code> for Python code and <code>go doc</code> for Go code,
but it’s not great. The list of variables and functions are maybe
suitable for libraries, but not for applications.
</p>
<p>
Since I don’t enjoy writing man pages directly (<code>man</code> is
actually a macro package for the <code>nroff</code> language, see
<strong>man nroff</strong>, obviously) I write my documentation in the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/ddevault/scdoc">scdoc</a> format.
<a class="account" href="https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault" title="@drewdevault@fosstodon.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="drewdevault">@drewdevault</span></a> wrote
it <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/05/13/scdoc.html">in 2018</a>.
It looks a bit like Markdown and friends and I like it. I even put a
little sequence of <code>sed</code> expressions into a Makefile to turn
scdoc into Markdown so that I could publish the man pages on this site,
see <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ man pages</a>.
</p>
<p>
When documentation for a project is a website, I wonder how they serve
people offline or with bad connections. Perhaps they want to write the
documentation in texinfo? I haven’t done that in a long time but I
really enjoy reading a well-written manual like that. And you can get a
PDF for free but I’m not sure anybody really wants that. Even a README
is bad because in those rare cases where the program gets added to a
distro, how will end-users find the README? Man pages are the answer.
</p>
<p>
README files and offline copies of the HTML documentation have multiple
problems: Which directory is it, exactly? <code>/usr/doc</code> does not
exist on my system. <code>/usr/share</code> lists lots of package names
but these are not the docs. <code>/usr/share/doc</code> is the one! But
the problems continue. Which of the directories do you check? Sometimes
you’re looking at binary and it’s also not obvious what the package name
would be. <code>find</code> is in <code>/usr/share/doc/findutils</code>,
for example. And we’re still not done. Which is the file that you want
to read when you’re faced with <code>BUGS changelog.Debian.gz
changelog.gz copyright README README.Debian README.frames
RELEASE-NOTES.txt WhatsNew.gz</code> – it’s README, I guess, but I am
always confused. It’s all very confusing.
</p>
<p>
Compared to this, man pages are so much better.
</p>
<p>
And some package managers like <code>go</code>, <code>pip</code>
(Python), <code>cabal</code> (Haskell) and <code>cargo</code> (Rust)
don’t install any of these files, I think.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that many developers consider using a website like
<a href="https://about.readthedocs.com/">Read the Docs</a> to be good
enough. Bad luck for people who are offline or who have bad reception,
in hotel rooms with bad wifi, in planes, in trains? My sister lives in
the Rhine valley, on the German side, close to Switzerland, in a tiny
village of a bit more than 100 people. They have no glass fibre. They
have bad reception, both from Switzerland and from Germany. It’s
terrible! But even for me: I have wifi in the apartment and glass
windows that act that block the signal. I have no reception on the
balcony unless I use my phone as a hotspot.
</p>
<p>
Local documentation that is easy to find is so much better.
</p>
<p>
And man pages are powerful. <em>All</em> of Perl is documented in many
pages. All the modules. All the switches. All the language features. I
learned to program in Perl from man pages back when my browser was
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_Mosaic">NCSA Mosaic</a>. (I
am a bit astonished to find that I still knew that acronym! But I didn’t
know that it stands for National Center for Supercomputing
Applications.) Anyway, what I wanted to say is that man pages can be
used to document large and complex things. From the command line, they
are readily accessible. With the right man reader, they can act as a
hypertext, linking to other pages. They don’t have to be terse and
cryptic, either. Man pages can be tutorials, introductions, FAQs, and
more. And if you write man pages using a suitable format, you can still
generate HTML pages with links.
</p>
<p>
If you’re not writing man pages, if your community doesn’t have the
habit of writing man pages, start small. Get <code>scdoc</code> and
write a little something. Skim <strong>man man-pages</strong> and learn
about the conventions, then write some text files. Then use <code>scdoc
&lt; text-file &gt; man-page</code> to create the file and install them
into <code>~/.local/share/man</code>, following the conventions. A page
from section 1 (commands) has the extension “.1” and goes into
<code>~/.local/share/man/man1</code> whereas a page from section 5 (file
formats and config files) has the extension “.5” and goes into
<code>~/.local/share/man/man5</code>.

<strong>2024-08-09</strong>. At one point I was interested in
<a href="2018-03-05_Troff">using troff as an alternative to LaTeX</a>,
so not to write documentation but to create PDFs, and I kept eyeing the
<a href="http://www.schaffter.ca/mom/mom-01.html">mom macros</a>. But
before I could give them a try I discovered how to
<a href="2020-07-24_Writing_Markdown,_generating_PDF">create PDFs using
Markdown to HTML to PDF</a> via weasyprint and that has been my workflow
ever since. For a zine I’m contributing to, however, I’m using
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/">groff</a> and the
<a href="https://www.troff.org/using-ms.pdf">ms macros</a> because
that’s what’s in the Makefile…
</p>
<p>
The reason I write this all up is that flexibeast wrote in, saying that
man pages can be written using the semantics-oriented
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mdoc.7">mdoc macros</a> instead of the
presentation-oriented <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man.7">man
macros</a> – and they had written an
<a href="https://github.com/flexibeast/guides/blob/master/mdoc-quickstart.md">mdoc
quickstart guide</a>. Nice!
</p>
<p>
I really have to take a look at
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc</a> as a groff
alternative.

Kennedy at Media Nation</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Four years ago, Boston lawyer and journalist James Barron wrote that
the Watergate break-in may well have been an attempt to steal documents
from Democratic Party headquarters showing that Nixon had taken $549,000
from the Greek government in order to help finance his 1968 campaign.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dan Kennedy argues that there are parallels here with the story,
reported a year ago, that Donald Trump might have partially funded his
2016 election campaign with an illegal contribution from the Egyptian
government.
</p>
<p>
It does seem strange that the story hasn’t been followed up on by either
the press or the Democratic Party. What sticks out to me about Dan’s
commentary, though, is this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“What makes a story stick is repetition — and without prominent
Democrats coming out every day and giving journalists something to
report on, it quickly withers away.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Should that be true? I’d hope that the press could find their own leads.
Otherwise it, in effect, becomes a press release driven industry. I’m
not disputing that it probably <em>is</em> true in reality, but I’d hope
for a better dynamic.

<h2 id="cosmic-alpha-released">COSMIC alpha released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>After two year of development, System76 has released the very first
alpha of COSMIC, their new Rust-based desktop environment for Linux.
This is an alpha release, so they make it clear there’s going to be bugs
and that there’s a ton of missing features at this point. As a whole,
COSMIC is a comprehensive operating system GUI (graphical user
interface) environment that features advanced functionality and a
responsive design. Its modular architecture is specifically designed to
facilitate the creation of unique, branded user experiences with ease. ↫
System76 website Don’t read too much into “branded experience” here – it
just means other Linux distributions can easily use their colours,
branding, and panel configurations. The settings application is also
entirely modular, so distributors can easily add additional panels, and
replace things like the update panel with one that fits their package
management system of choice. COSMIC also supports extensive theming, and
if you’re wondering – yes, all of these are answers to the very reason
COSMIC was made in the first place: GNOME’s restrictiveness. There’s not
much else to say here yet, since it’s an alpha release, but if you want
to give it a go, the announcement post contains links to instructions
for a variety of Linux distributions. COSMIC is also slowly making its
way into Redox, the Rust-based operating system led by Jeremy Soller, a
System76 employee.</p>

company’s new manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Georgia. The plant
would be Qcell’s second in Georgia, but the largest of its kind in the
U.S., churning out solar panel components like silicon ingots and
wafers, as well as finished solar panels. Its completion will
“re-establish critical parts of the domestic solar supply chain and
reinforce the United States’ status as a global clean energy leader,”
the Department of Energy said in a statement. The plant will create
1,950 jobs, and is expected to make 3.3 gigawatts of panels each year,

Canadian nuclear fusion company General Fusion this week raised about
$14.6 million in a Series F funding round from two government agencies,
the Business Development Bank of Canada and Canadian Nuclear

published in the journal <em>Science</em> examines how the Earth’s
plants and carbon cycle have responded in the past to climate change
caused by huge releases in carbon dioxide from volcanic activity. They
find that the severity of the fallout depended on how quickly the Earth
could sequester the carbon and remove it from the atmosphere, but also
how well plants could adapt to the resulting temperature changes. After
past volcanic eruptions, some plant species evolved to survive, some
migrated to cooler climates, but others were wiped out entirely. The
authors found that damages to vegetation made global warming worse in
the past. “This study, in my perspective, serves as a ‘wake-up call’ for
the global community,”

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I’m Georgie and I was born and reside in Sydney, Australia. I grew up in
the ’burbs, which was something I despised until I moved to a spot
closer to the city, and there’s a certain nostalgia that Arcade Fire’s
The Suburbs evokes about my childhood that no other album or song has
done to date.
</p>
<p>
My first experience using a computer was when I was probably about four
years old, watching my dad type commands into MS-DOS to launch games.
When I couldn’t figure out how to load King’s Quest, I would just type
<code>dir</code> and press spacebar dozens of times for amusement until
my dad came to my aid. These days, I work as a software engineer and I
fell into this line of work after teaching myself how to code and build
websites, then trying to find data entry jobs, but realising there were
actually jobs for building websites.
</p>
<p>
I’ve competed in two powerlifting competitions (placing third and
second), I used to be a concert photographer and a ballerina, I like
hiking, and I am passionate about expressing myself through my style and
what I wear. One might describe my style as containing deliberate
elements of juxtaposition, and a blend of 80s, 90s, punk, and grunge. I
am a 90s kid, pretty much, but my interests and knowledge of pop culture
give people the impression that I’m an older millennial than I actually
am. I also still get ID’d, and it now amuses me since I’m old enough to
appreciate it. I’ll take what I can get.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
After playing Neopets in the early 2000s and then getting my account
banned because I was transferring items and neopoints to myself from a
secondary account, I started blogging on LiveJournal. My website was on
a free hosting site, and was my playground for practicing coding and
graphic design. I was writing about pretty inane stuff on LiveJournal,
and my website was reserved for updates about graphics, trivia and other
miscellanea I was adding to my website.
</p>
<p>
Since I had been writing in a physical diary for most of my childhood
and early adolescence, writing stuff online seemed like a fair
transition. It was also easier for me to let my friends read my diary if
it was on a website they could visit.
</p>
<p>
After LiveJournal, I blogged on MSN Spaces for a while. My blog was
called “Consolation in a Jar”, because I thought the visual of a jar was
cute (think those jars full of hand-made paper stars) and also because I
was going through a difficult time with severe depression.
</p>
<p>
I forget what my website’s name was when I first created it, but I
settled on the name “Out The Window”. I am pretty sure it came from the
Linkin Park song “In The End”. I started blogging about my school life
and hobbies, and more emotional posts found their home on Consolation in
a Jar.
</p>
<p>
In 2008 I registered my first domain name, Heartdrops.org. This is the
URL at which I gained a lot of notoriety, fame, what have you. MSN
Spaces had shut down, and I chose not to save all of the painful posts
I’d published. Heartdrops became my main blog, and would be that way for
four years. Facebook took off around this time, and I continued to
strongly hold the opinion that friends could contact me via phone number
or—quite literally—my website that I’d had years before social media.
</p>
<p>
I started a few other blogs for different creative projects, like
photoblogging, letters to friends, and scans of doodling and drawing on
paper. I went through a couple of cycles of starting new blogs for
specific topics, then pulling them all back into my main blog. Now I
like to have everything in the one place and feel free to use my space
to write about any topic I want.
</p>
<p>
I’d been using georgie.nu as a “domain collective”—a website to showcase
all of my domains and projects—for three years before I decided to name
rename Heartdrops to “Hey Georgie” and use the URL. I was working on an
exciting, bold WordPress theme that was a departure from my usual design
style, and didn’t suit the name Heartdrops. I started to feel like the
name was juvenile and reminded me too much of a difficult time in my
life.
</p>
<p>
My blog has been called Hey Georgie for the past 12 years now. I feel
like it suits my personality more accurately. The name just comes from
the greeting of “hey” or “hello”, but one of my favourite local bands is
called Hey Geronimo as well. I know I must have sounded like a hypocrite
when I renamed my blog because I used to diss people who had their name
in their website name. I said so much shit online in my youth. But damn,
have I learned. I have learned a lot.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
In my early years of blogging (from the mid to late 2000s), I would just
sit at my computer or laptop and write any time I wanted a blog post to
happen, or if I had an idea, I would try to write the blog post as soon
as possible. My ideas mostly revolved around funny stories from my
childhood, or experiences in my day to day as a suburban kid being in
the heart of the city for university and social events. I would usually
write a 500-word post in 30 minutes or so. I didn’t proofread. It was a
combination of being a little bit cocky and confident in my writing
skills and speed, and an obsession with posting something every two
days. I just wanted to write the blog post and be done, and took pride
in having something new to share.
</p>
<p>
My process is very different these days. I’ve not only matured, but the
blog posts I write are less stream-of-consciousness and centre around a
specific topic. They take a bit more time because I care about them
reading well and being well structured. My writing has matured the same
way I’ve matured as a person.
</p>
<p>
I stopped having the freedom to just drop everything and write as soon
as an idea came to mind, so I keep a list of ideas instead. I don’t have
as many ideas as I used to. When I think about why, I think it’s that I
don’t enjoy writing about the mundanities of life the way that I did as
an adolescent. (I promise my life is not boring… haha.) My interest in
writing about certain topics also waned. Any time I’m in the mood, I’ll
take one of those ideas and just start writing something until I get
stuck, then I leave the draft there and come back to it later. Some of
those drafts never see the light of day because I give up on the idea,
while others are eventually worked on and published. In the past, I had
the mentality of a completist and anything I worked on was published,
even if I thought it sucked. I still don’t proofread too meticulously,
and sometimes I even do it after I’ve published a post, because I am so
comfortable with my writing that there will usually only be some small
typos. If the topic is a really delicate one, I might ask a couple of
close friends to proofread it.
</p>
<p>
I used to use an app called Bear to help me focus while I was writing.
Now I just write most of my posts directly in my WordPress installation
or in the Notes app on my iPhone or MacBook. I can’t remember why I
abandoned Bear, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it had something to do
with paying for features that I refused to pay for.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
My physical space really influences my ability to write and put a blog
post together. I value my noise-cancelling headphones and a bit of
stoner rock or hard rock or metal. It’s music that’s energetic enough
because of the beat, and I like having the lyrics present, but they
don’t feel distracting because the vocals are rough. I also need to be
physically comfortable, but this doesn’t necessarily mean I need to be
in an armchair in a library. I like cafes, and often work from them, but
I can’t write while sitting in a cafe unless it’s during a quieter time
of the day and the cafe doesn’t play pop music loudly for ambiance. I
can write whilst sitting on a park bench, even if the bench isn’t like a
sofa, but maybe there aren’t many people around and the weather is
pleasant. I can write from my phone on public transport, as long as I
have a long enough journey and am seated by the window.
</p>
<p>
Oddly enough, I’ve found that I can write better and am more forced to
focus during periods of being “in transit”, like sitting in an airport
lounge, being on a long-distance ferry, or waiting at a cafe for a
friend to arrive because I’m early for our date. It might be because
there is a definite end to the time I’m in that place—compared to
sitting at home with an entire afternoon ahead of me and falling into
procrastination. It is entirely possible that the “forced deadline”
created by being in those temporary situations is beneficial for me
because of my neurodivergent brain. If I’m at home, I just won’t make a
deadline to write a post by, but in some of the scenarios I described, I
have no choice.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I register most of my domains with NameCheap (I have one on
<a href="https://name.com/">Name.com</a>). Before I could afford to pay
for my own hosting, I had a friend who set me up on her shared hosting.
I bought my own plan at NameCheap after about a decade of her generously
letting me use some of her space for free.
</p>
<p>
I use self-hosted WordPress. I take pride in the fact that I’ve coded my
theme myself—it’s not compatible with new features of WordPress and I
don’t try to make it that way, as it’s mostly just an outlet for my
coding creativity. I remember the days when I had the time, inspiration,
and energy to code and update a new theme every two weeks. If I remember
correctly, my current theme has been there since 2018, which is a
personal record for me. I’m not sure what changed (apart from the
obvious, like having more responsibilities in life and already doing
coding as part of my day job, etc.). I think I just focused more on the
idea of “branding” and simplicity, and that led me to build something
that I was happy with long-term.
</p>
<p>
I know WordPress has an interesting (if not slightly poor) reputation,
but I’ve just used it ever since I had my own domain name in the late
00’s, and I decided to stick with it. I’ve had many conversations with
friends about why I never converted to a static site generator, or why I
don’t do it now. I put too much emphasis on comments and having a
comments section, and didn’t want them to be owned by a third-party
service. A friend even joked that he’d build something custom for me,
but my needs made him give up. Hahah. I have well over 1,500 blog posts
and 26,000 comments. The thought of migrating them was not only a tricky
problem to solve, but at some point converting them made the possibility
of a sunk cost fallacy inevitable. I debated just removing the comment
functionality entirely, given that most readers either don’t leave
comments, or reach out to me through email or social media to share
their thoughts. With the rise of social media-type trolling comments and
inauthentic AI-generated ones, perhaps this could be a reason to no
longer care about blog post comments…
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I’m not sure that I would do anything too differently, because I’ve
owned a blog for so long and the things I would do differently have
already been applied, or weren’t too hard to change on an existing blog.
For example, the renaming of my blog from Heartdrops to Hey Georgie was
pretty straightforward.
</p>
<p>
If you asked me to start fresh today, perhaps I really would abandon the
whole comment thing—hahaha—and then use it as an opportunity to use
something that will let me write blog posts more “simply” with Markdown.
That’s probably all I’d really change. These days it’s not uncommon for
a blog to have no comments section, but it was just such a huge part of
me making friends and connections on the internet pre-social media.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the Web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost, or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
In a year, for domain and hosting, I pay about $80–100 AUD, give or
take. The .nu domain is notoriously expensive and costs some $40 a year,
but I committed to that when I first got it. Haha. (It’s kind of like
the custom licence plate I have for my car; I committed to that several
hundred dollar annual payment when I got it, so I keep paying for it
because it has sentimental value.) I don’t pay much attention to the
actual cost. I just pay for it when it’s due. Even though my frequency
of posts don’t suggest this, my blog is my passion project and something
I really care about.
</p>
<p>
I feel very strongly about monetising content in relation to being my
authentic self online. The topic first came up for me a while ago, long
before social media and living in a world of subscriptions and content
creation and ads and things. I first dabbled in sponsored posts and
accepting money for links when I only had a job for six hours a week,
because I just wanted extra cash. I felt uncomfortable about it though,
and I realised that my personal morals were important to me. All my
friends were telling me that I should make money from my online space,
but it didn’t sound like something I wanted to do. I put a PayPal donate
button on my blog and I felt gross, especially after I managed to get
more part time jobs. My blog was an outlet for my writing and a place
where I put my honest and personal thoughts. It was not a business.
</p>
<p>
I decided that my blog would always be a space that genuinely represents
myself and the things I care about and stand for. I previously accepted
payment for certain types of advertisements that I might not agree with
today. These days, I accept payment for in-post advertising, and free
products in return for honest reviews, but they must be from businesses
or companies whose principles I support, or whose products I might
actually use.
</p>
<p>
If other people choose to monetise their blog, I think they have every
right to do so. But I will admit that it’s sometimes funny to see
advertisements completely unrelated to the blog’s general content. It
only bothers me if someone’s blog is littered with ads and content that
they obviously paid for. But then I think we are getting into “content
creation” territory, which I consider different from people’s personal
blogs.
</p>
<p>
I don’t usually financially support other bloggers. If they have some
kind of “buy me a coffee” link, I might buy them a few coffees but it’ll
be a once-off. If I get to meet any other bloggers in real life, I am
more than happy to buy them a coffee in person. 😊
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
My good friend Pauline at
<a href="https://pawlean.com/">pawlean.com</a>, my friend Jane from
<a href="https://lemonandlively.com/">lemonandlively.com</a>, Ruben at
<a href="https://rubenerd.com/">rubenerd.com</a>, Jem at
<a href="https://jemjabella.co.uk/">jemjabella.co.uk</a>. 💙 I’m sure
least one of them might be up for an interview, but I’d gladly read an
interview with any of them.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
If you’ve read this far, just, thank you. I think there might be some
people reading this who know me from when I was literally fifteen years
old, too, which is not only astonishing, but really touching to me that
there was something about my writing or about me as a person that made
you read my blog in the first place. I’ve always liked writing, and
unlike other interests and hobbies, it’s a thing that innately stays
with you over time.
</p>
<p>
I have a podcast called
<a href="https://toast-and-roast.simplecast.com/">Toast &amp; Roast</a>,
a super low budget pod that my friend and I record for fun. It was a
mid-pandemic project that has been going for several years, and I think
the success of its tenure is to do with the fact that our recording
sessions are also the time we chat and catch up. We release episodes
weekly. It’s got the same unfiltered vibe that my blog posts have, and
we don’t really plan topics. Hopefully we’re the kind of pod you might
have playing in the background or just listen to when you don’t feel
like paying too much attention. I like to think it’s like eavesdropping
on two friends who are just talking shit. But if you’ve ever wanted to
put a voice to my face or writing, or whatever… hehe.
</p>
<p>
You can find me on Instagram at
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/hey.georgie/"><span class="citation"
data-cites="hey.georgie">@hey.georgie</span></a>, where I mostly post
outfits and travel pictures. It’s ended up being the platform I use most
to interact with internet folk. I joined back when filters were part of
the aesthetic, and I think you couldn’t even write a caption? Instagram
has continued to be a good way to see what my friends are up to and to
message them casually. I was also an early adopter of Twitter and got a
lot of value out of it, but it’s no longer the platform it once was.
However, you can find me on
<a href="https://aus.social/@heygeorgie">Mastodon</a> where I don’t mind
posting silly thoughts and banter.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2020, in the early months of the pandemic, I published a poetry
collection called “<a href="https://hey.georgie.nu/tosib/">the off
switch is broken</a>”, inspired by my experience as a software engineer,
growing up on the internet, and what identity means online. It has
themes of discomfort and failure, as well as nostalgia and triumph.
Although there are pieces of poetry in the depths of my blog, this was
something I created with a lot more intent. I hope you consider taking a
look, as I think it documents feelings that we all share.

California wildfire chews through timber in very hot and dry
weather</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICO, California — California’s largest wildfire so far this year
continued to grow Thursday as it chewed through timber in very hot and
dry weather.</p>
<p>The Park Fire has scorched more than 1,709 square kilometers since
erupting July 24 near the Sacramento Valley city of Chico and burning
northward up the western flank of the Sierra Nevada. Containment
remained at 34%, Cal Fire said.</p>
<p>The conflagration’s early explosive growth quickly made it
California’s fourth-largest wildfire on record before favorable weather
reduced its intensity late last week. It reawakened this week due to the
heat and very low relative humidity levels.</p>
<p>A large portion of the burned area was in mop-up stage but spot fires
were a continuing problem, officials said during Thursday morning’s
operational briefing.</p>
<p>The fire’s northeast corner was the top firefighting priority,
operations deputy Jed Gaines said.</p>
<p>“It’s not time to celebrate,” he said. “We got several more days of
hard work to hold what we got in there.”</p>
<p>The latest Park Fire assessments found 636 structures destroyed and
49 damaged. A local man was arrested after authorities alleged he
started the fire by pushing a burning car into a gully in a wilderness
park outside Chico.</p>
<p>About 160 kilometers to the south, a new forest fire in El Dorado
County was exhibiting extreme behavior, and some Park Fire aircraft were
being diverted there.</p>
<p>The Crozier Fire, about 16 kilometers north of Placerville, had
burned more than 5.17 square kilometers of timber and chaparral as of
Thursday evening and was just 5% contained. The fire threatens 1,625
structures, according to Cal Fire.</p>

panda habitat opens at California zoo to much fanfare</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>san diego, california — Two Chinese giant pandas are now California
residents as their enclosure at the San Diego Zoo opened to the public
on Thursday in an international ceremony. </p>
<p>The pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, are the first to enter the United
States in 21 years and were welcomed by California Governor Gavin Newsom
and the Chinese ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng.  </p>
<p>Yun Chuan, a 5-year-old male, is easily recognized by his long,
slightly pointed nose, while Xin Bao is a 4-year-old female with big
fluffy ears whose name means a “precious treasure of prosperity and
abundance.” </p>
<p>Yun Chuan’s name means “big river of cloud.” His mother, Zhen Zhen,
was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007. </p>
<p>The zoo is working closely with Chinese experts to help with the
adaptation period and understanding of the needs of the two pandas. The
pair are enjoying a variety of fresh bamboo and a local adaptation of
“wotou,” a traditional Chinese steamed cornbread that’s also called
“panda bread.” </p>
<p>“The arrival of Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, as we celebrate the 45th
anniversary of our diplomatic ties, has sent a clear and important
message,” said Xie.  </p>
<p>“China-U.S. cooperation on panda conservation will not cease. Our
people-to- people exchanges and subnational cooperation will not stop,
and once opened, the door of China-U.S. friendship will not be shut
again,” he added. </p>
<p>Newsom said the new pandas were about “celebrating our common
humanity. It’s about celebrating the things that bind us together.” </p>
<p>“And so, for me, this spirit of pride that is associated with this
opening today with the experience that so many will have, that we just
had at Panda Ridge, is about a deeper meaning,” Newsom added. </p>
<p>Visitors of all ages to Panda Ridge on Thursday were exuberant about
the pandas’ cuteness. </p>
<p>“I have never seen a panda before. I’ve only seen them on TV and
nature documentaries,” said Kobi Davis from Michigan. “They are super
cute. They just kind of laze around, you know. There’s charm in that.”
 </p>
<p>Keena Butcher from Canada called them “quiet, thoughtful creatures,
and just realize we can have hope for our future if we can conserve
them.”  </p>
<p>China’s Communist government has long used “panda diplomacy” to
enhance the country’s soft power, lending the large but cuddly looking
black-and-white bears to zoos in various countries over the decades as
goodwill animal ambassadors. </p>
<p>In late 2023, Washington’s National Zoo said goodbye to its beloved
giant pandas, which were returned to China amid heightened tensions
between the two global superpowers. </p>
<p>In May this year, the National Zoo said China would send two young
pandas to Washington by the end of the year.</p>

<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/projects/HkRoz49I">GPU
Libc Benchmarking</a>. The main objective of this project was to develop
microbenchmarking infrastructure for libc on the GPU.
</p>
<h1 id="background">
Background
</h1>
<p>
The LLVM libc project was designed as an alternative to glibc that aims
to be modular, configurable, and sanitizer-friendly. Currently, LLVM
libc is being ported to Nvidia and AMD GPUs to give libc functionality
(e.g. printf(), malloc(), and math functions) on the GPU. As of March
2024, programs can use GPU libc in offloading languages (CUDA, OpenMP)
or through direct compilation and linking with the libc library.
</p>
<h1 id="what-we-did">
What We Did
</h1>
<p>
During this project, we developed a microbenchmarking framework that is
directly compiled for and run on the GPU, using libc functions to
display output to the user. As this was a short project (90 hours), we
mostly focused on developing the infrastructure and writing a few
example usages (isalnum(), isalpha(), and sin()).
</p>
<p>
Our benchmarking infrastructure is based on Google Benchmark and
measures the average cycles, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of
each benchmark. Each benchmark is run for multiple iterations to
stabilize the results. Benchmark writers can measure against vendor
implementations of libc functions by passing specific linking flags to
the benchmark’s CMake portion and registering the corresponding vendor
function from the benchmark itself.
</p>
<p>
Below is an example of our benchmarking infrastructure’s output for
<code>sinf()</code>

This project met its major goal of creating microbenchmarking
infrastructure for the GPU. However, the original scope of this proposal
included a CPU component that would use vendor tools to measure GPU
kernel properties. However, this was removed after discussion with the
mentors due to technical obstacles in offloading specific kernels to the
GPU that would require major changes to other parts of the code.

<h1 id="future-work">
Future Work
</h1>
<p>
As this was a short project (90 hours), we only focused on implementing
the microbenchmarking infrastructure. Future contributors can use the
benchmarking infrastructure to add additional benchmarks. In addition,
there are improvements to microbenchmarking infrastructure that could be
added, such as more options for user input ranges, better random
distributions for math functions, and a CPU element that can launch
multiple kernels and compare results against functions running on the
CPU.
