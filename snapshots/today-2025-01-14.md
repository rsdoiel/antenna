The Stake [Amazon] is the book about the CoActive Leadership program. It’s written in a different way, from the other books from the perspective of the people taking it and the journeys they go on.

## Codestral 25.01

date: 2025-01-13, updated: 2025-01-13, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://mistral.ai/news/codestral-2501/">Codestral 25.01</a></strong></p>
Brand new code-focused model from Mistral. Unlike <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/30/codestral/">the first Codestral</a> this one isn't (<a href="https://twitter.com/sophiamyang/status/1878908474811404664">yet</a>) available as open weights. The model has a 256k token context - a new record for Mistral.</p>
<p>The new model scored an impressive joint first place with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Deepseek V2.5 (FIM) on the Copilot Arena leaderboard. </p>
<p>Chatbot Arena <a href="https://blog.lmarena.ai/blog/2024/copilot-arena/">announced Copilot Arena</a> on 12th November 2024. The leaderboard is driven by results gathered through their <a href="https://lmarena.ai/copilot">Copilot Arena</a> VS Code extensions, which provides users with free access to models in exchange for logged usage data plus their votes as to which of two models returns the most useful completion.</p>
<p>So far the only other independent benchmark result I've seen is for the <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">Aider Polyglot test</a>. This was <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1878886495609815054">less impressive</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Codestral 25.01 scored 11% on the aider polyglot benchmark. </p>
<p>62% o1 (high)<br>
48% DeepSeek V3<br>
16% Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B Instruct<br>
11% Codestral 25.01<br>
4% gpt-4o-mini</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new model can be accessed via my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-mistral">llm-mistral</a> plugin using the <code>codestral</code> alias (which maps to <code>codestral-latest</code> on <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/getting-started/models/models_overview/">La Plateforme</a>):</p>
