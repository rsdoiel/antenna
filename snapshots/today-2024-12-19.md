## More Than Watergate: The PRMPA

date: 2024-12-19, from: National Archives, Pieces of History blog

Today’s post on the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act (PRMPA) comes from Laurel Gray, a processing intern with the Textual Division at the National Archives in Washington, DC. It is the second of a four-part&#160;series on&#160;the archival ramifications of the Watergate scandal. When President Richard Nixon resigned in August 1974, he signed an agreement &#8230; <a href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2024/12/19/more-than-watergate-the-prmpa/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">More Than Watergate: The PRMPA</span></a>

## Building Python tools with a one-shot prompt using uv run and Claude Projects

date: 2024-12-19, updated: 2024-12-19, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>I've written a lot about how I've been using Claude to build one-shot HTML+JavaScript applications <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-artifacts/">via Claude Artifacts</a>. I recently started using a similar pattern to create one-shot Python utilities, using a custom Claude Project combined with the dependency management capabilities of <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>.</p>
<p>(In LLM jargon a "one-shot" prompt is a prompt that produces the complete desired result on the first attempt.)</p>
<p>I'll start with an example of a tool I built that way.</p>
<p>I had another round of battle with Amazon S3 today trying to figure out why a file in one of my buckets couldn't be accessed via a public URL.</p>
<p>Out of frustration I prompted Claude with a variant of the following (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9f69cf35889b0445b80eeed691d44504">full transcript here</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>I can't access the file at EXAMPLE_S3_URL. Write me a Python CLI tool using Click and boto3 which takes a URL of that form and then uses EVERY single boto3 trick in the book to try and debug why the file is returning a 404</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wrote me <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/python/debug_s3_access.py">this script</a>, which gave me exactly what I needed. I ran it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uv run debug_s3_access.py \
  https://test-public-bucket-simonw.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/0f550b7b28264d7ea2b3d360e3381a95.jpg</pre></div>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/debug-s3.jpg" alt="Terminal screenshot showing S3 access analysis results. Command: '$ uv run http://tools.simonwillison.net/python/debug_s3_access.py url-to-image' followed by detailed output showing bucket exists (Yes), region (default), key exists (Yes), bucket policy (AllowAllGetObject), bucket owner (swillison), versioning (Not enabled), content type (image/jpeg), size (71683 bytes), last modified (2024-12-19 03:43:30+00:00) and public access settings (all False)" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/tree/main/python#debug_s3_accesspy">see the text output here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="inline-dependencies-and-uv-run">Inline dependencies and uv run</h4>
<p>Crucially, I didn't have to take any extra steps to install any of the dependencies that the script needed. That's because the script starts with this magic comment:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-c"># /// script</span>
<span class="pl-c"># requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</span>
<span class="pl-c"># dependencies = [</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "click",</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "boto3",</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "urllib3",</span>
<span class="pl-c">#     "rich",</span>
<span class="pl-c"># ]</span>
<span class="pl-c"># ///</span></pre>
<p>This is an example of <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies">inline script dependencies</a>, a feature described in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/">PEP 723</a> and implemented by <code>uv run</code>. Running the script causes <code>uv</code> to create a temporary virtual environment with those dependencies installed, a process that takes just a few milliseconds once the <code>uv</code> cache has been populated.</p>
<p>This even works if the script is specified by a URL! Anyone with <code>uv</code> installed can run the following command (provided you trust me not to have replaced the script with something malicious) to debug one of their own S3 buckets:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uv run http://tools.simonwillison.net/python/debug_s3_access.py \
  https://test-public-bucket-simonw.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/0f550b7b28264d7ea2b3d360e3381a95.jpg</pre></div>
<h4 id="writing-these-with-the-help-of-a-claude-project">Writing these with the help of a Claude Project</h4>
<p>The reason I can one-shot scripts like this now is that I've set up a <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/projects">Claude Project</a> called "Python app". Projects can have custom instructions, and I used those to "teach" Claude how to take advantage of inline script dependencies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You write Python tools as single files. They always start with this comment:</p>
<pre><span># /// script</span>
<span># requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</span>
<span># ///</span></pre>
<p>These files can include dependencies on libraries such as Click. If they do, those dependencies are included in a list like this one in that same comment (here showing two dependencies):</p>
<pre><span># /// script</span>
<span># requires-python = "&gt;=3.12"</span>
<span># dependencies = [</span>
<span>#     "click",</span>
<span>#     "sqlite-utils",</span>
<span># ]</span>
<span># ///</span></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That's everything Claude needs to reliably knock out full-featured Python tools as single scripts which can be run directly using whatever dependencies Claude chose to include.</p>
<p>I didn't suggest that Claude use <a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich">rich</a> for the <code>debug_s3_access.py</code> script earlier but it decided to use it anyway!</p>
<p>I've only recently started experimenting with this pattern but it seems to work <em>really</em> well. Here's another example - my prompt was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Starlette web app that provides an API where you pass in ?url= and it strips all HTML tags and returns just the text, using beautifulsoup</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/08957a1490ebde1ea38b4a8374989cf8">the chat transcript</a> and <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/08957a1490ebde1ea38b4a8374989cf8/raw/143ee24dc65ca109b094b72e8b8c494369e763d6/strip_html.py">the raw code it produced</a>. You can run that server directly on your machine (it uses port 8000) like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uv run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonw/08957a1490ebde1ea38b4a8374989cf8/raw/143ee24dc65ca109b094b72e8b8c494369e763d6/strip_html.py</pre></div>
<p>Then visit <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/?url=https://simonwillison.net/</code> to see it in action.</p>
<h4 id="custom-instructions">Custom instructions</h4>
<p>The pattern here that's most interesting to me is using custom instructions or system prompts to show LLMs how to implement new patterns that may not exist in their training data. <code>uv run</code> is less than a year old, but providing just a short example is enough to get the models to write code that takes advantage of its capabilities.</p>
<p>I have a similar set of custom instructions I use for creating single page HTML and JavaScript tools, again running in a Claude Project:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never use React in artifacts - always plain HTML and vanilla JavaScript and CSS with minimal dependencies.</p>
<p>CSS should be indented with two spaces and should start like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic"><pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span class="pl-ent">style</span><span class="pl-kos">&gt;</span>
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}</pre></div>
<p>Inputs and textareas should be font size 16px. Font should always prefer Helvetica.</p>
<p>JavaScript should be two space indents and start like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-basic"><pre><span class="pl-kos">&lt;</span><span class="pl-ent">script</span> <span class="pl-c1">type</span>="<span class="pl-s">module</span>"<span class="pl-kos">&gt;</span>
// code in here should not be indented at the first level</pre></div>
</blockquote>

## How to shrink ONNX files

date: 2024-12-19, from: Peter Warden

I&#8217;ve been using the ONNX Runtime a lot recently, and while it has been a lot of fun, there are a few things I&#8217;ve missed from the TensorFlow Lite world. The biggest (no pun intended) is the lack of tools to shrink the model file size, something that&#8217;s always been essential in the mobile app [&#8230;]

## Java in the Small

date: 2024-12-18, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2024-12-11/index.html">Java in the Small</a></strong></p>
Core Java author Cay Horstmann describes how he now uses Java for small programs, effectively taking the place of a scripting language such as Python. </p>
<p>TIL that hello world in Java can now look like this - saved as <code>hello.java</code>:</p>
<pre><code>void main(String[] args) {
    println("Hello world");
}
</code></pre>
<p>And then run (using <code>openjdk 23.0.1</code> on my Mac, installed at some point by Homebrew) like this:</p>
<pre><code>java --enable-preview hello.java
</code></pre>
<p>This is so much less unpleasant than the traditional, boiler-plate filled Hello World I grew up with:</p>
<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I always hated how many concepts you had to understand just to print out a line of text. Great to see that isn't the case any more with modern Java.

## A new free tier for GitHub Copilot in VS Code

date: 2024-12-18, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-in-vscode-free/">A new free tier for GitHub Copilot in VS Code</a></strong></p>
It's easy to forget that GitHub Copilot was the first widely deployed feature built on top of generative AI, with its initial preview launching all the way back in June of 2021 and general availability in June 2022, 5 months before the release of ChatGPT.</p>
<p>The idea of using generative AI for autocomplete in a text editor is a really significant innovation, and is still my favorite example of a non-chat UI for interacting with models.</p>
<p>Copilot evolved <em>a lot</em> over the past few years, most notably through the addition of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide">Copilot Chat</a>, a chat interface directly in VS Code. I've only recently started adopting that myself - the ability to add files into the context (a feature that I believe was first shipped by Cursor) means you can ask questions directly of your code. It can also perform prompt-driven rewrites, previewing changes before you click to approve them and apply them to the project.</p>
<p>Today's announcement of a permanent free tier (as opposed to a trial) for anyone with a GitHub account is clearly designed to encourage people to upgrade to a full subscription. Free users get 2,000 code completions and 50 chat messages per month, with the option of switching between GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.</p>
<p>I've been using Copilot for free thanks to their open source maintainer program for a while, which <a href="https://github.com/pricing#i-work-on-open-source-projects-can-i-get-access-to-github-copilot-for-free">is still in effect today</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People who maintain popular open source projects receive a credit to have 12 months of GitHub Copilot access for free. A maintainer of a popular open source project is defined as someone who has write or admin access to one or more of the most popular open source projects on GitHub. [...] Once awarded, if you are still a maintainer of a popular open source project when your initial 12 months subscription expires then you will be able to renew your subscription for free.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn't instantly obvious to me how to switch models. The option for that is next to the chat input window here, though you may need to enable Sonnet in the <a href="https://github.com/settings/copilot">Copilot Settings</a> GitHub web UI first:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of VS Code - the Copilot Chat panel is open, there's a select box at the bottom for 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, o1-mini and o1-preview" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/copilot-switch-models.jpg" />

## A polite disagreement bot ring is flooding Bluesky — reply guy as a (dis)service

date: 2024-12-18, updated: 2024-12-18, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/12/07/a-polite-disagreement-bot-ring-is-flooding-bluesky-reply-guy-as-a-disservice/">A polite disagreement bot ring is flooding Bluesky — reply guy as a (dis)service</a></strong></p>
Fascinating new pattern of AI slop engagement farming: people are running bots on Bluesky that automatically reply to "respectfully disagree" with posts, in an attempt to goad the original author into replying to continue an argument.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear what the intended benefit is here: unlike Twitter there's no way to monetize (yet) a Bluesky account through growing a following there - and replies like this don't look likely to earn followers.</p>
<p>rahaeli <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rahaeli.bsky.social/post/3lcqer5hvgc2h">has a theory</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Watching the recent adaptations in behavior and probable prompts has convinced me by now that it's not a specific bad actor testing its own approach, btw, but a bad actor <em>tool maker</em> iterating its software that it plans to rent out to other people for whatever malicious reason they want to use it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the bots leaked part of its prompt (nothing public I can link to here, and that account has since been deleted):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Your response should be a clear and respectful disagreement, but it must be brief and under 300 characters. Here's a possible response: "I'm concerned that your willingness to say you need time to think about a complex issue like the pardon suggests a lack of preparedness and critical thinking."</code></p>
