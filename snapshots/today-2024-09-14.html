DePrince, whose career inspired many after she was born into war, dies
at 29</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — Ballet dancer Michaela Mabinty DePrince,
who came to the United States from an orphanage in war-ravaged Sierra
Leone and performed on some of the world’s biggest stages, has died, her
family said in a statement. She was 29.</p>
<p>“Michaela touched so many lives across the world, including ours. She
was an unforgettable inspiration to everyone who knew her or heard her
story,” her family said in a statement posted Friday on DePrince’s
social media accounts. “From her early life in war-torn Africa, to
stages and screens across the world, she achieved her dreams and so much
more.”</p>
<p>A cause of death was not provided.</p>
<p>DePrince was adopted by an American couple and by age 17 she had been
featured in a documentary film and had performed on the TV show “Dancing
with the Stars.”</p>
<p>After graduating from high school and the American Ballet Theatre’s
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School, she became a principal dancer with
the Dance Theatre of Harlem. She then went to the Netherlands, where she
danced with the Dutch National Ballet. She later returned to the U.S.
and joined the Boston Ballet in 2021.</p>
<p>“We’re sending our love and support to the family of Michaela Mabinty
DePrince at this time of loss,” the Boston Ballet said in a statement to
The Associated Press on Saturday. “We were so fortunate to know her; she
was a beautiful person, a wonderful dancer, and she will be greatly
missed by us all.”</p>
<p>In her memoir, Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina, she
shared her journey from the orphanage to the stage. She also wrote a
children’s book, Ballerina Dreams.</p>
<p>DePrince suffered from a skin pigmentation disorder that had her
labeled “the devil’s child” at the orphanage.</p>
<p>“I lost both my parents, so I was there [the orphanage] for about a
year, and I wasn’t treated very well because I had vitiligo,” DePrince
told the AP in a 2012 interview. “We were ranked as numbers, and number
27 was the least favorite and that was my number, so I got the least
amount of food, the least amount of clothes and whatnot.”</p>
<p>She added that she remembered seeing a photo of an American ballet
dancer on a magazine page that had blown against the gate of the
orphanage during Sierra Leone’s civil war.</p>
<p>“All I remember is she looked really, really happy,” DePrince told
the AP, adding that she wished “to become this exact person.”</p>
<p>She said she saw hope in that photo, “and I ripped the page out and I
stuck it in my underwear because I didn’t have any place to put it,” she
said.</p>
<p>Her passion helped inspire young Black dancers to pursue their
dreams, her family said.</p>
<p>“We will miss her and her gorgeous smile forever and we know you
will, too,” their statement said.</p>
<p>Her sister, Mia Mabinty DePrince, recalled in the statement that they
slept on a shared mat in the orphanage and used to make up their own
musical theater plays and ballets.</p>
<p>“When we got adopted, our parents quickly poured into our dreams and
arose the beautiful, gracefully strong ballerina that so many of you
knew her as today. She was an inspiration,” Mia DePrince wrote. “Whether
she was leaping across the stage or getting on a plane and flying to
third-world countries to provide orphans and children with dance
classes, she was determined to conquer all her dreams in the arts and
dance.”</p>

says it is open to talks but rejects pressure from US, EU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DUBAI — Iran’s foreign minister said that Tehran was open to
diplomacy to solve disputes but not “threats and pressure,” state media
reported on Saturday, after the U.S. and three European powers imposed
sanctions against the country’s aviation sector.</p>
<p>Abbas Araqchi’s comments come a day after the European Union’s chief
diplomat said the bloc is considering new sanctions targeting Iran’s
aviation sector, in reaction to reports Tehran supplied Russia with
ballistic missiles in its war against Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Iran continues on its own path with strength, although we have
always been open to talks to resolve disputes … but dialogue should be
based on mutual respect, not on threats and pressure,” Araqchi said,
according to the official news agency IRNA.</p>
<p>Araqchi said on Wednesday that Tehran had not delivered any ballistic
missiles to Russia and that sanctions imposed on Iran by the United
States and three European powers would not solve any problems between
them.</p>
<p>The United States, Germany, Britain and France on Tuesday imposed new
sanctions on Iran, including measures against its national airline, Iran
Air.</p>

id="prince-harry-turns-40-as-the-royal-scamp-moves-to-middle-age">Prince
Harry turns 40 as the royal scamp moves to middle age</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — Prince Harry was always something different.</p>
<p>From the moment he first appeared in public, snuggled in Princess
Diana’s arms outside the London hospital where he was born in 1984,
Harry was the ginger-haired scamp who stuck his tongue out at
photographers. He grew to be a boisterous adolescent who was roundly
criticized for wearing a Nazi uniform to a costume party, and then a
young man who gave up the trappings of royal life and moved to Southern
California with his American wife.</p>
<p>Through it all, there was a sense that Harry was rebelling against an
accident of birth that made him, in the harsh calculus of the House of
Windsor, just “the spare.” As the second son of the man who is now King
Charles III, he was raised as a prince but wouldn’t inherit the throne
unless brother William came to harm.</p>
<p>Now the angry young man is turning 40, the halfway point in many
lives, providing a chance to either dwell on the past or look forward to
what might still be achieved.</p>
<p>For the past four years, Harry has focused mainly on the past, making
millions of dollars by airing his grievances in a wildly successful
memoir and a Netflix docu-series. But he faces the likelihood that the
royal aura so critical to his image may be fading, said Sally Bedell
Smith, author of “Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable
Life.”</p>
<p>“He is at a sort of crossroads,’’ Smith told The Associated Press.
“And he appears to be struggling with how he wants to proceed.’’</p>
<p>How did we get here?</p>
<p>It wasn’t always this way.</p>
<p>Six years ago, Harry and his wife were among the most popular royals,
a glamorous young couple who reflected the multicultural face of modern
Britain and were expected to help revitalize the monarchy.</p>
<p>Their wedding on May 19, 2018, united a grandson of Queen Elizabeth
II with the former Meghan Markle, a biracial American actress who had
starred for seven years in the U.S. television drama “Suits.” George
Clooney, Serena Williams and Elton John attended their wedding at
Windsor Castle, after which the couple were formally known as the Duke
and Duchess of Sussex.</p>
<p>But the optimism quickly faded amid allegations that Britain’s
tabloid media and even members of the royal household treated Meghan
unfairly because of racism.</p>
<p>By January 2020, the pressures of life in the gilded cage had become
too much, and the couple announced they were giving up royal duties and
moving to America, where they hoped to become “financially independent.”
They signed lucrative deals with Netflix and Spotify as they settled
into the wealthy enclave of Montecito, near Santa Barbara,
California.</p>
<p>Since then, Harry has missed few opportunities to bare his soul, most
famously in his memoir, aptly titled “Spare.”</p>
<p>In the ghostwritten book, Harry recounted his grief at the death of
Princess Diana, a fight with Prince William and his unease with life in
the royal shadow of his elder brother. From accounts of cocaine use and
losing his virginity to raw family rifts, the book was rife with damning
allegations about the royal family.</p>
<p>Among the most toxic was Harry’s description of how some family
members leaked unflattering information about other royals in exchange
for positive coverage of themselves. The prince singled out his father’s
second wife, Queen Camilla, accusing her of feeding private
conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate an image
tarnished by her role in the breakup of Charles’ marriage to Diana.</p>
<p>The allegations were so venomous that there is little chance of a
return to public duty, Smith said.</p>
<p>“He criticized the royal family in such a powerful and damaging way.
You can’t un-say those things,” she said. “And you can’t unsee things
like Meghan in that Netflix series doing a mock curtsey. It’s such a
demeaning gesture to the queen.’’</p>
<p>Harry, who agreed not to use the honorific HRH, or “his royal
highness,” after he stepped away from front-line royal duties, is now
fifth in line to the British throne, behind his brother and William’s
three children.</p>
<p>While he grew up in a palace and is said to be in line to inherit
millions of dollars on his 40th birthday from a trust set up by his
great-grandmother, applied developmental psychologist Deborah Heiser
thinks that, in many ways, Harry is just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Like anyone turning 40, he is likely to have learned a few lessons
and has a good idea of who his real friends are, and that will help him
chart the next phase of his life, said Heiser, who writes a blog called
“The Right Side of 40” for Psychology Today.</p>
<p>“He has had a very public display of what a lot of people have gone
through,” Heiser said. “I mean, most people are not princes, but … they
have all kinds of issues within their families. He’s not alone. That’s
why he’s so relatable.’’</p>
<p>Harry’s next chapter</p>
<p>Of course, Harry’s story isn’t just about the drama within the House
of Windsor.</p>
<p>If he wants to write a new chapter, Harry can build on his 10 years
of service in the British Army. Before retiring as a captain in 2015,
the prince earned his wings as a helicopter pilot, served two tours in
Afghanistan and shed the hard-partying reputation of his youth.</p>
<p>Harry also won accolades for establishing the Invictus Games in 2014,
a Paralympic-style competition to inspire and aid in the rehabilitation
of sick and wounded servicemembers and veterans.</p>
<p>Harry and Meghan made headlines this year with their two
international trips to promote mental health and internet safety. While
some in British media criticized them for accepting royal treatment in
Nigeria and Colombia, the couple said they visited at the invitation of
local officials.</p>
<p>Will Charles see the grandkids?</p>
<p>The prospects of reconciliation are unclear, although Harry did race
home to see his father after Charles’ cancer diagnosis. And in what may
be seen as a tentative olive branch, the paperback edition of “Spare”
slated for October has no additions — so nothing new to stir the
pot.</p>
<p>But plainly at this point, Harry is thinking about his family in
California. He told the BBC about the importance of his two young
children, Archie and Lilibet.</p>
<p>“Being a dad is one of life’s greatest joys and has only made me more
driven and more committed to making this world a better place,” the
prince said in a statement released by his spokesperson.</p>

id="new-york-city-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-study-slavery-and-reparations">New
York City lawmakers approve bill to study slavery and reparations</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — New York City lawmakers approved legislation Thursday to
study the city’s significant role in slavery and consider reparations to
descendants of enslaved people.</p>
<p>If signed into law, the package of bills passed by the City Council
would follow in the footsteps of several other municipalities across the
U.S. that have sought ways to address the country’s dark history, as
well as a separate New York state commission that began working this
year.</p>
<p>New York fully abolished slavery in 1827. But businesses, including
the predecessors of some modern banks, continued to benefit financially
from the slave trade — likely up until 1866. The lawmakers behind the
proposals noted that the harms caused by the institution are still felt
by Black Americans today.</p>
<p>“The reparations movement is often misunderstood as merely a call for
compensation,” Council Member Farah Louis, a Democrat who sponsored one
of the bills, told the City Council on Thursday. She explained that
systemic forms of oppression are still impacting people through
redlining, environmental racism and services in predominantly Black
neighborhoods that are underfunded.</p>
<p>The bills still need to be signed by Democratic Mayor Eric Adams.
City Hall signaled his support in a statement calling the legislation
“another crucial step towards addressing systemic inequities, fostering
reconciliation, and creating a more just and equitable future for all
New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>The bills would direct the city’s Commission on Racial Equity to
suggest remedies to the legacy of slavery, including reparations. It
would also create a truth and reconciliation process to establish
historical facts about slavery in the state.</p>
<p>One of the proposals would also require that the city install an
informational sign on Wall Street in Manhattan to mark the site of New
York’s first slave market, which operated between 1711 and 1762. A sign
was placed nearby in 2015, but Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams, a
Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said its location is
inaccurate.</p>
<p>The commission would work with the existing state commission, which
is also considering the possibility of reparations. A report from the
state panel, which held its first public meeting in late July, is
expected in early 2025. The city effort wouldn’t need to produce
recommendations until 2027.</p>
<p>The city’s commission was created out of a 2021 racial justice
initiative during then-Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration, which also
recommended the city track data on the cost of living and add a
commitment to remedy “past and continuing harms” to the city charter’s
preamble.</p>
<p>“Your call and your ancestors’ call for reparations had not gone
unheard,” Linda Tigani, executive director of the racial equity
commission, said at a news conference ahead of the council vote.</p>
<p>A financial impact analysis of the bills estimated that the studies
would cost $2.5 million.</p>
<p>New York is the latest city to study reparations. Tulsa, Oklahoma,
where a notorious massacre of Black residents took place in 1921,
announced a similar commission last month.</p>
<p>Evanston, Illinois, became the first city to offer reparations to
Black residents and their descendants in 2021, including distributing
some payments of $25,000 in 2023, according to PBS. The eligibility was
based on harm suffered as a result of the city’s discriminatory housing
policies or practices.</p>
<p>San Francisco approved reparations in February, but the mayor later
cut the funds, saying that reparations should instead be carried out by
the federal government. California budgeted $12 million for a
reparations program that included helping Black residents research their
ancestry, but it was defeated in the state’s Legislature this month.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States Navy’s elite SEAL Team Six would
likely have a limited role in defending Taiwan should China invade the
self-governing and democratic island, say analysts responding to a
Financial Times report that the unit has been training for it for more
than one year.</p>
<p>Lyle J. Morris, senior fellow for foreign policy and national
security at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China
Analysis, tells VOA’s Mandarin Service that if the unit is indeed
preparing for an attack by Beijing, it may indicate that the U.S. is
more deeply involved in defending Taiwan than previously thought.</p>
<p>However, he stressed that the secret and precise combat
characteristics of SEAL Team Six mean its role in resisting China’s
invasion of Taiwan would be very limited and the focus would be on
carrying out special tasks.</p>
<p>“As far as their sheer capability to repel an invasion. I think
that’s more limited,” he says. “I think it’s in a very discreet, narrow
way of coming in for a specific task that Taiwan might need, whether
it’s helping to protect, let’s say, an airfield in Taiwan or protect a
communication asset in Taiwan, in Taipei, they could come in and out
very discreetly and very lethally to protect that asset.”</p>
<p>SEAL Team Six specializes in performing sensitive, highly difficult
missions. In 2009, the unit rescued Richard Phillips, captain of the MV
Maersk Alabama, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates.</p>
<p>The elite unit gained an international reputation after the
successful raid on al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden’s compound in
Pakistan in 2011.</p>
<p>It is one of the most highly regarded U.S. military units, along with
the United States Army’s Delta Force, the 75th Ranger Regiment’s
Regimental Reconnaissance Company, the Intelligence Support Activity,
and the Air Force’s 24th Special Tactics Squadron, and part of the Joint
Special Operations Command.</p>
<p>“Navy SEALs usually deployed from submarines or, most likely, small
ships and are useful for targeting vulnerabilities in enemies’
presentation,” Richard D. Fisher Jr., senior fellow with the
International Assessment and Strategy Center, tells VOA.</p>
<p>Analysts say the U.S. military likely revealed the SEAL Team Six
training program to the Financial Times to send a warning to Beijing
amid China’s increasingly assertive moves in the region.</p>
<p>“This is one way the U.S. is bolstering deterrence towards China,
towards preventing a Chinese invasion of Taiwan,” says Morris. “So, I
think this is just an added factor getting China to second guess or to
reconsider what it will face if it were to invade Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China
Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University and a former Central
Intelligence Agency military analyst, posted on social media platform X,
“It is sure to get under Beijing’s skin.”</p>
<p>In a written response to VOA’s Mandarin Service, Liu Pengyu, the
spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said, “The Taiwan
question is the very core of China’s core interests and the first red
line that must not be crossed in the China-U.S. relationship.”</p>
<p>He urged “the U.S. to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and
the three China-U.S. joint communiques, stop enhancing military contact
with the Taiwan region or arming it by any means or under whatever
pretext, stop creating factors that could heighten tensions in the
Taiwan Strait, and stop conniving at and supporting the separatists’
attempt to seek ‘Taiwan independence’ by force.”</p>
<p>Taiwan split from China during the civil war that saw the Communist
Party seize power in Beijing in 1949 and the Nationalist Party flee to
the island, which developed into a flourishing democracy. But China’s
one-party, authoritarian state never gave up its claim to Taiwan and
considers it a renegade province that must one day reunite with the
mainland, by force if necessary.</p>
<p>Admiral Philips Davidson, former commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific
Command, warned in 2021 that China could attack Taiwan within six years.
President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that if China invades
Taiwan, the U.S. will intervene militarily to defend it.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Defense declined to confirm or deny the
Financial Times report. Pentagon spokesperson John Supple said in an
email to VOA, “The DoD and our service members prepare and train for a
wide range of contingencies. We will not comment on specifics, but will
restate that we are committed to our longstanding one China policy,
guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques, and the
Six Assurances. As we have said before, conflict is neither imminent nor
inevitable.”</p>
<p>America’s one-China policy is a strategically ambiguous agreement it
made in 1972 to establish relations with China that recognizes Beijing
as the only government of China and acknowledges, but does not endorse,
Beijing’s claim that Taiwan is part of China.</p>
<p>Washington has unofficial relations with Taiwan defined through the
Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques with Beijing, and the
Six Assurances with Taipei, which underscore U.S. opposition to attempts
to unilaterally alter the status quo and determination to help Taiwan
defend itself through weapons sales.</p>
<p>There has been previous U.S. military training for Taiwan’s defense,
both on the island and in the United States. Reuters reported last year
the U.S. was set to expand the number of troops helping train Taiwanese
forces on the island, and Taiwanese officials confirmed more of their
troops would be training in the U.S.</p>

id="on-the-streets-of-a-colorado-city-pregnant-migrants-struggle-to-survive">On
the streets of a Colorado city, pregnant migrants struggle to
survive</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AURORA, Colorado — She was eight months pregnant when she was forced
to leave her Denver homeless shelter. It was November.</p>
<p>Ivanni Herrera took her 4-year-old son, Dylan, by the hand and led
him into the chilly night, dragging a suitcase containing donated
clothes and blankets away from the Microtel Inn &amp; Suites. It was one
of 10 hotels where Denver has housed more than 30,000 migrants, many of
them Venezuelan, over the last two years.</p>
<p>First, they walked to Walmart. There, with money she and her husband
earned begging on the street, they bought a tent.</p>
<p>They chose for their new home a grassy median along a busy
thoroughfare in Aurora, the next town over, a suburb known for its
immigrant population.</p>
<p>“We wanted to go somewhere where there were people,” Herrera, 28,
said in Spanish. “It feels safer.”</p>
<p>That night, temperatures dipped to 32 degrees. And as she wrapped her
body around her son’s, Ivanni Herrera cried.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, a record number of Venezuelans have come to
the United States seeking a better life. Instead, they’ve found
themselves in communities roiling over how much to help the newcomers —
or whether to help at all.</p>
<p>Unable to legally work without filing expensive and complicated
paperwork, some have found themselves sleeping on the streets — even
those who are pregnant.</p>
<p>Herrera had found inspiration for her journey to the U.S. on social
media. On Facebook and TikTok, young, smiling Venezuelan migrants in
nice clothes stood in front of new cars. Some 320,000 Venezuelans have
tried to cross the U.S. border since October 2022, according to U.S.
Border Patrol reports — more than in the previous nine years
combined.</p>
<p>Just weeks after arriving in Denver, Herrera began to wonder if the
success she had seen was real.</p>
<p>She was seeing doctors and social workers at a Denver hospital where
she planned to give birth because they served everyone, even those
without insurance. They were alarmed their pregnant patient was now
sleeping outside in the cold.</p>
<p>In Colorado’s third-largest city, Aurora, officials have turned down
requests to help migrants. In February, the City Council passed a
resolution telling other cities and nonprofits not to bring migrants
into the community because it “does not currently have the financial
capacity to fund new services.” Yet still they come, because of its
lower cost of living and Spanish-speaking community.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump last week called attention to the city,
suggesting a Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment complex.
Authorities say that hasn’t happened.</p>
<p>The doctors urged Herrera to sleep at the hospital. It wouldn’t cost
anything, they assured her, just as her birth would be covered by
emergency Medicaid.</p>
<p>Herrera refused.</p>
<p>“How,” she asked, “could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold
on the street?”</p>
<p>Denver struggled to keep up with the rush of migrants, many arriving
on buses chartered by Texas to draw attention to the impact of
immigration. All told, Denver officials say they have helped some 42,700
migrants since last year, either by giving them shelter or a bus fare to
another city.</p>
<p>Initially, the city offered migrants with families six weeks in a
hotel. But any migrants arriving since May have received only three days
in a hotel. After that, some have found transportation to other cities,
scrounged for a place to sleep or wandered into nearby towns like
Aurora.</p>
<p>Today, fewer migrants are coming to the Denver area. But Candice
Marley, founder of a nonprofit called All Souls, still receives dozens
of outreaches per week from social service agencies looking to help
homeless migrants. All Souls had run encampments for migrants, but
Denver shut them down because they lacked a permit.</p>
<p>“It’s so frustrating that we can’t help them,” Marley said. “That
leaves families camping on their own, unsupported, living in their cars.
Kids can’t get into school. There’s no stability.”</p>
<p>When Herrera started feeling labor pains in early December, she
waited until she couldn’t bear the pain anymore and could feel the baby
getting close. She called an ambulance.</p>
<p>The paramedics didn’t speak Spanish but called an interpreter. They
told Herrera they had to take her to the closest hospital, instead of
the one in Denver, since her contractions were so close together.</p>
<p>Her son was born healthy at 7 pounds, 8 ounces. She took him to the
tent the next day. A few days later the whole family, including the
baby, had contracted chicken pox. “The baby was in a bad state,” said
Emily Rodriguez, a close friend living with her family in a tent next to
Herrera’s.</p>
<p>Herrera took him to the hospital, then returned to the tent before
being offered a way out. An Aurora woman originally from Mexico invited
the family to live with her — at first, for free. After a couple weeks,
the family moved to a small room in the garage for $800 a month.</p>
<p>To earn rent and pay expenses, Herrera and Rodriguez have cleaned
homes, painted houses and shoveled snow while their children waited in a
car by themselves. Finding regular work and actually getting paid for it
has been difficult. While their husbands can get semi-regular work in
construction, the women’s most consistent income comes from standing
outside with their children and begging. On a good day, each earns about
$50.</p>
<p>Herrera and her husband recently became eligible to apply for work
permits and legal residency for Venezuelans who arrived in the United
States last year. But it will cost $800 each for a lawyer to file the
paperwork, along with hundreds of dollars in government fees. They don’t
have the money.</p>
<p>What’s worse, they’re deeply in debt. Despite what the hospital had
said when she was pregnant, Herrera was never signed up for emergency
Medicaid. She says she owes $18,000 for the ambulance ride and delivery
of her baby. Now, she avoids going to the doctor or taking her children
because she’s afraid her large debt will jeopardize her chances of
staying in the U.S. “I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,” she
says.</p>
<p>Herrera and Rodriguez now hold cardboard signs along a busy street in
Denver and then knock on the doors of private homes, never returning to
the same address. They type up their request for clothes, food or money
on their phones and translate it to English using Google. They hand
their phones to whoever answers the door.</p>
<p>Herrera recently sent $500 to her sister to make the monthslong trip
from Venezuela to Aurora with Herrera’s 8-year-old daughter. “I’ll have
my family back together,” she says. And she believes her sister will be
able to watch her kids so Herrera can look for work.</p>
<p>The problem is, Herrera hasn’t told her family back in Venezuela how
she spends her time. “They think I’m fixing up homes and selling
chocolate and flowers,” she says. “I’m living a lie.”</p>
<p>Finally, her sister and daughter are waiting across the border in
Mexico. When we come to America, her sister asks, could we fly to
Denver? The tickets are $600.</p>
<p>Herrera has to come clean. Life is far more difficult than she has
let on.</p>
<p>She texts back:</p>
<p>No. </p>

city reshaped by Haitian immigrants lands in unwelcome spotlight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Many cities have been reshaped by immigrants in
the last few years without attracting much notice. Not Springfield,
Ohio.</p>
<p>Its story of economic renewal and related growing pains has been
thrust into the national conversation in a presidential election year —
and maliciously distorted by false rumors that Haitian immigrants are
eating their neighbors’ pets. Donald Trump amplified those lies during
Tuesday’s nationally televised debate, exacerbating some residents’
fears about growing divisiveness in the predominantly white, blue-collar
city of about 60,000.</p>
<p>At the city’s Haitian Community Help and Support Center on Wednesday,
Rose-Thamar Joseph said many of the roughly 15,000 immigrants who
arrived in the past few years were drawn by good jobs and the city’s
relative affordability. But a rising sense of unease has crept in as
longtime residents increasingly bristle at newcomers taking jobs at
factories, driving up housing costs, worsening traffic and straining
city services.</p>
<p>“Some of them are talking about living in fear. Some of them are
scared for their life,” Joseph said.</p>
<p>A “Welcome To Our City” sign hangs from a parking garage downtown,
where a coffee shop, bakery and boutique line Springfield’s main drag,
North Fountain Street. A flag advertising “CultureFest,” the city’s
annual celebration of unity through diversity, waves from a pole
nearby.</p>
<p>Melanie Flax Wilt, a Republican commissioner in the county where
Springfield is located, said she has been pushing for community and
political leaders to “stop feeding the fear.”</p>
<p>“After the election and everybody’s done using Springfield, Ohio, as
a talking point for immigration reform, we are going to be the ones here
still living through the challenges and coming up with the solutions,”
she said.</p>
<p>Ariel Dominique, executive director of the Haitian American
Foundation for Democracy, said she laughed at first at the absurdity of
the false claims. But seeing the comments repeated on national
television by the former president was painful.</p>
<p>“It is so unfair and unjust and completely contrary to what we have
contributed to the world, what we have contributed to this nation for so
long,” Dominique said.</p>
<p>The falsehoods about Springfield’s Haitian immigrants were spread
online by Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, on the eve of Tuesday’s debate
between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. It’s part of a timeworn
American political tradition of casting immigrants as outsiders.</p>
<p>“This is what’s happening in our country. And it’s a shame,” Trump
said at the debate after repeating the falsehoods. When challenged by
ABC News moderator David Muir over the false claims, Trump held firm,
saying “people on television” said their dogs were eaten, but he offered
no evidence.</p>
<p>Officials in Springfield have tried to tamp down the misinformation
by saying there have been no credible or detailed reports of any pets
being abducted or eaten. State leaders are trying to help address some
of the real challenges facing the city.</p>
<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said Tuesday he would add more
law enforcement and health care resources to an aid package the state
has already provided to Springfield.</p>
<p>Many Haitians have come to the U.S. to flee poverty and violence.
They have embraced President Joe Biden’s new and expanded legal pathways
to enter, and have shunned illegal crossings, accounting for only 92
border arrests out of more than 56,000 in July, the latest data
available.</p>
<p>The Biden administration recently announced an estimated 300,000
Haitians in the U.S. could remain in the country at least through
February 2026, with eligibility for work authorization, under a law
called Temporary Protected Status. The goal is to spare people from
being deported to countries in turmoil.</p>
<p>Springfield, about 72 kilometers from the state capital of Columbus,
suffered a steep decline in its manufacturing sector toward the end of
the last century, and its population shrank as a result. But its
downtown has been revitalized in recent years as more Haitians arrived
and helped meet the rising demand for labor as the economy emerged from
the pandemic. Officials say Haitians now account for about 15% of the
population.</p>
<p>The city was shaken last year when a minivan slammed into a school
bus, killing an 11-year-old boy. The driver was a Haitian man who
recently settled in the area and was driving without a valid license.
During a city commission meeting on Tuesday, the boy’s parents condemned
politicians’ use of their son’s death to stoke hatred.</p>
<p>Last week, a post on the social media platform X shared what looked
like a screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield.
The post claimed without evidence that the person’s “neighbor’s
daughter’s friend” saw a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and
eaten, outside a house where it claimed Haitians lived. It was
accompanied by a photo of a Black man carrying what appeared to be a
goose by its feet.</p>
<p>On Monday, Vance posted on X: “Reports now show that people have had
their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this
country.” The next day, he posted again, saying his office had received
inquiries from Springfield residents who said “their neighbors’ pets or
local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.”</p>
<p>Longtime Springfield resident Chris Hazel, who knows the park and
neighborhood where the pet and goose abductions were purported to have
happened, called the claims “preposterous.”</p>
<p>“It reminds me of when people used to accuse others and outsiders as
cannibals. It’s dehumanizing a community,” he said of the accusations
against the city’s Haitian residents.</p>
<p>Sophia Pierrilus, the daughter of a former Haitian diplomat who moved
to the Ohio capital of Columbus 15 years ago and is now an immigrant
advocate, agreed, calling it all political.</p>
<p>“My view is that’s their way to use Haitians as a scapegoat to bring
some kind of chaos in America,” she said.</p>
<p>With its rising population of immigrants, Springfield is hardly an
outlier. So far this decade, immigration has accounted for almost
three-quarters of U.S. population growth, with 2.5 million immigrants
arriving in the United States between 2020 and 2023, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau. Population growth is an important driver of economic
growth.</p>
<p>“The Haitian immigrants who started moving to Springfield the last
few years are the reason why the economy and the labor force has been
revitalized there,” said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the
Haitian Bridge Alliance, which provides legal and social services to
immigrants across the U.S.</p>
<p>Now, she said, Haitians in Springfield have told her that, out of
fear, they are considering leaving the city.</p>

id="share-of-foreign-born-people-in-us-is-at-highest-rate-in-over-a-century-survey-says">Share
of foreign-born people in US is at highest rate in over a century,
survey says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>miami — The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign-born last
year grew to its highest level in more than a century, according to
figures released Thursday from the most comprehensive survey of American
life. </p>
<p>The share of people born outside the United States increased in 2023
to 14.3% from 13.9% in 2022, according to estimates from the U.S. Census
Bureau’s annual American Community Survey, which tracks commuting times,
internet access, family life, income, education levels, disabilities,
military service and employment, among other topics. </p>
<p>International migrants have become a primary driver of population
growth this decade, increasing their share of the overall population as
fewer children are being born in the U.S. compared with numbers from
years past. The rate of the foreign-born population in the United States
hasn’t been this high since 1910, when it was 14.7%, driven by waves of
people emigrating in search of a better life. </p>
<p>“We knew that here you can have savings, live well. Here you can have
normal services such as water and electricity,” said Luciana Bracho, who
moved legally to Miami from Venezuela as part of a humanitarian parole
program with her boyfriend, parents and brother in April 2023. “I like
Miami and the opportunities that I have had.” </p>
<p>In 2023, international migrants accounted for more than two-thirds of
the population growth in the United States, and so far this decade they
have made up almost three-quarters of U.S. growth. </p>
<p>The growth appears to have been driven by people coming from Latin
America, whose share of the foreign-born population increased
year-over-year to 51.2% from 50.3%, according to the estimates. Latin
America was the only world region of origin to experience an increase
among those U.S. residents born in another country, as the share of
foreign-born residents from Europe and Asia dropped slightly. </p>
<p>Nicole Díaz, a Venezuelan opposition activist, left after receiving
threats to her life and lived in Peru and Ecuador before moving to the
Miami area legally in February 2023 with her husband and 9-year-old
daughter. Díaz described herself as “100% happy” living in South
Florida, where they pay $2,300 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. </p>
<p>“After being in different countries, working here is relaxed, despite
the language,” Díaz said. “But housing is very expensive, and we have
been evaluating moving to another state because here all the salary goes
for the rent.” </p>
<p>Among the states with the largest year-over-year bumps in the
foreign-born population was Delaware, going to 11.2% from 9.9%; Georgia,
to 11.6% from 10.7%; and New Mexico, to 10.2% from 9.3% The share of the
foreign-born population dropped slightly in Washington, D.C., Idaho,
Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon. </p>
<p>The Census Bureau figures don’t distinguish whether people are in the
United States legally or illegally. Illegal immigration has become a top
issue in the 2024 presidential race, even as illegal border crossings
from Mexico plunged this summer after reaching a record last
December. </p>
<p>The share of U.S. residents who identify as Hispanic, no matter what
race, rose last year to 19.4% from 19.1% in the previous year, according
to the survey. At the same time, those who identify as non-Hispanic
white alone dropped from 57.7% to 57.1%. The share of U.S. residents who
identify as Black alone dropped slightly, from 12.2% to 12.1%, and it
increased slightly for those who identify as Asian alone from 5.9% to
6%. </p>
<p>Residents in the United States continued to get older, with the
median age increasing from 39 in 2022 to 39.2 in 2023. The nation’s
aging is taking place as a majority of baby boomers have become senior
citizens and millennials are entering middle age. While the share of
children under age 18 remained steady at 21.7% year-over-year, the share
of senior citizens age 65 and over increased to 17.7% from 17.3%. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a post-pandemic bump in working from home continued its
slide back to pre-COVID-19 times, as the share of employees working from
home dropped last year to 13.8% from 15.2% in the previous year. </p>
<p>In 2021, the first full year after the pandemic’s start, almost 18%
of employees were working from home, up from 5.7% in 2019. But
return-to-office mandates in the past two years have reversed that trend
and caused commute times to bump up slightly last year, growing on
average to 26.8 minutes from 26.4 minutes. </p>
<p>The survey also showed that the median cost of renting, plus
utilities and related expenses, grew faster than median home values in
2023 for the first time in a decade. The 3.8% jump in rental costs was
the largest annual increase since at least 2011. Despite the spike in
rental costs, the share of renter income spent on rent and utilities
remained unchanged at 31% in 2023, suggesting that incomes kept pace
with rent hikes, the Census Bureau said.</p>

battle for influence in Africa plays out in Central African
Republic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BANGUI, Central African Republic — Hours after Russian mercenary
leader Yevgeny Prigozhin rebelled against his country’s top military
leaders, his private army’s biggest client in Africa panicked, turning
for help to his foe in the West. </p>
<p>Officials from Central African Republic, where some 1,500 of
Prigozhin’s Wagner Group mercenaries were stationed, wrote a letter that
day, requesting to “rapidly” arrange a meeting with a private U.S.
security firm to discuss collaboration. </p>
<p>Dated June 23, 2023, the day Prigozhin launched the armed rebellion,
the letter sparked a series of meetings, culminating in a deal with the
central African nation and Bancroft Global Development. That sparked
backlash from Russian mercenaries, according to a dozen diplomats,
locals, and analysts. </p>
<p>The tensions in Central African Republic are a window into a larger
battle playing out across the continent as Moscow and Washington vie for
influence. </p>
<p>The Russian mercenaries — using success in staving off rebels in this
impoverished nation as a model for expansion — have long been accused by
locals and rights groups of stripping natural resources such as minerals
and timber and are linked to the torture and death of civilians. In the
wake of Prigozhin’s rebellion and suspicious death in a plane crash, the
Russians are recalibrating their Africa operations. The United States,
which has been largely disengaged from the region for years, is
attempting to maintain a presence and stymie Russian gains as it pushes
African countries to distance themselves from the mercenaries. </p>
<p>U.S. officials blame Russia for anti-American sentiment in the region
and say they’re trying to shift the narrative. </p>
<p>“If the U.S. can’t regain a foothold, it could give Russia greater
economic and political leverage,” said Samuel Ramani of the Royal United
Services Institute, a defense and security think tank. “If Russia loses
Central African Republic, its flagship model on the continent, there
could be a domino effect in other countries.” </p>
<p>Russia’s influence </p>
<p>In recent years, Russia has emerged as the security partner of choice
for a growing number of governments in the region, displacing
traditional allies such as France and the U.S. </p>
<p>Moscow expanded its military cooperation by using mercenaries like
Wagner, which since around 2017 has operated in at least half a dozen
countries by protecting African leaders and in some cases helping fight
rebels and extremists. </p>
<p>They’re also plagued by their human rights record. Two years ago in
Mali, Wagner and the army were accused of executing about 300 men — some
suspected of being Islamist extremists, but most civilians — in what
Human Rights Watch called the worst single atrocity reported in the
country’s decade-long armed conflict. And in Central African Republic,
mercenaries train the army on torture tactics, including how to tburn
people alive, according to watchdog The Sentry. </p>
<p>Central African Republic </p>
<p>Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries
entered. The country has been in conflict since 2013, when predominantly
Muslim rebels seized power and forced the president from office. Six of
the 14 armed groups that signed a 2019 peace deal later left the
agreement. Locals and the government credited Wagner with fighting back
rebels who tried to overtake Bangui, the capital, in 2021. The Russians
soon expanded to Burkina Faso and Niger, and have ambitions for further
growth. </p>
<p>Russia is refurbishing a military base some 80 kilometers from
Bangui. Alexander Bikantov, Russia’s ambassador to Central African
Republic, said the base will improve the country’s security. </p>
<p>Fidele Gouandjika, adviser to President Faustin-Archange Touadera,
said the base aims to have 10,000 fighters by 2030 to engage with more
African nations. </p>
<p>Touadera’s office didn’t reply to written requests for comment for
this story. His adviser to the country’s spy agency declined to be
interviewed. </p>
<p>Pressure from United States </p>
<p>The U.S. had been pushing Central African Republic to find an
alternative to Wagner for years. A more assertive U.S. approach came as
it faced new setbacks and tried to rework agreements in the region. Its
troops left Chad and Niger, where they were no longer welcome. </p>
<p>Still, the State Department said in a statement this year that it
wasn’t involved in the decision to establish Bancroft Global
Development’s presence in Central African Republic. </p>
<p>But Washington could deny such contracts if it wanted, said Sean
McFate, a former contractor in Africa and author of “The New Rules of
War.” </p>
<p>The U.S. has used private military companies to reduce American
“boots on the ground” in Africa, McFate said, and companies like
Bancroft have to play by Washington’s rules if they want future
government work. </p>
<p>In response to AP questions, the U.S. official who spoke on condition
of anonymity said it uses private contractors in Africa to help
countries operate more effectively, with U.S. government oversight to
ensure accountability. The official said the State Department has
overseen Bancroft’s work in Somalia but not Central African Republic or
elsewhere. </p>
<p>Bancroft’s background </p>
<p>Washington-based Bancroft is a nonprofit working in nine countries —
five in Africa. Its involvement in Central African Republic has been
shrouded in secrecy since signs emerged of its presence last fall. </p>
<p>During an AP visit months later, rumors swirled about Bancroft’s
activities, fueling speculation the U.S was bringing its own Wagner to
oust Russia. </p>
<p>But according to Bancroft founder Michael Stock, the group entered at
Bangui’s behest. </p>
<p>Stock received the letter from the presidency within a day of
Prigozhin’s mutiny, and the two signed a deal in September, he
said. </p>
<p>Fewer than 30 Bancroft personnel work there, Stock said, helping
Central African Republic with intelligence systems, interagency
cooperation and law enforcement. </p>
<p>Bancroft has invested some $1.4 million there, Stock said. </p>
<p>Much of Bancroft’s funding has come from U.S. and United Nations
grants. From 2018 to 2020, it received more than $43 million from the
U.S., according to audits required as part of tax forms. </p>
<p>Amal Ali, a former U.S. intelligence analyst, is among critics who
say that despite its yearslong presence in Somalia, Bancroft hasn’t
contributed to any eradication of terrorism. </p>
<p>Stock dismissed such comments as uninformed and said the Somali and
U.S. governments “agree Bancroft has done a great deal to damaging
illegal armed groups and developing the capacity of the government to
perform its national defense functions professionally.” </p>
<p>Backlash on the ground </p>
<p>Rights groups say a lack of transparency about Bancroft’s operations
has fostered an atmosphere of distrust in a country already rampant with
armed actors. Wagner, a U.N. peacekeeping mission and Rwandan troops are
all on the ground to try to quell violence. </p>
<p>“Operating in a vague and nontransparent way in the Central African
Republic only leads to suspicion,” said Lewis Mudge, of Human Rights
Watch. </p>
<p>Stock defended Bancroft’s work and policies. “It is perfectly normal
for a government not to publicize how it is defending the people and the
state,” he told AP. </p>
<p>Unclear future </p>
<p>As the U.S. and Russia jockey for power, African governments say they
want to make their own choices. </p>
<p>Central African Republic officials approached Bancroft, which shows
that these governments haven’t become Russian puppets, said Jack
Margolin, an expert on private military companies. </p>
<p>But, he added, Russia’s reaction to Bancroft could hurt Moscow’s
standing with other nations. </p>
<p>After Prigozhin’s death, Russia moved quickly to take control of
Wagner’s assets, and the defense ministry told countries where Wagner
operated that it would take over. The country and its military
intelligence arm have taken a more direct role in Africa operations,
deploying more official detachments from its army. </p>
<p>In Central African Republic, it’s unclear how much sway the Russian
state has with the mercenaries, who are beloved by many. For most people
here, there’s little interest in squabbles among foreign nations. </p>
<p>“There are problems between the Americans and Russians, but that
doesn’t matter to us,” said Jean Louis Yet, who works at Bangui’s
market. “We are here working, trying our best to make a living. All we
want is security.”</p>

<h2 id="mounting-north-korean-threats-await-next-us-president">Mounting
North Korean threats await next US president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Recent moves by Pyongyang have focused attention on what
will be one of the first major foreign policy challenges facing the next
U.S. president: how to deal with North Korea’s rapidly developing
nuclear threat.</p>
<p>In a set of rapid-fire developments on Friday:</p>
<p>— North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an “exponential
increase” in the size of his nation’s nuclear arsenal, according to the
state-run news agency KCNA. He made the same call in speeches on Tuesday
and on the last day of 2022.</p>
<p>— State media released photos for the first time of the Nuclear
Weapons Institute where North Korea processes uranium for the
manufacture of nuclear weapons. The photos, which showed a sophisticated
array of centrifuges, were made public as Kim toured the facility.</p>
<p>— North Korea announced that it had tested a new type of 600 mm
multiple rocket launcher the previous day. South Korea said on Thursday
that North Korea test-fired several short-range ballistic missiles into
the waters off the eastern coast.</p>
<p>The developments came in the context of enhanced military cooperation
between North Korea and Russia, which is believed to be helping
Pyongyang to develop its weapons capabilities in exchange for munitions
used in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>“The threat from North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs has been
growing steadily and virtually unchecked over the course of several U.S.
administrations,” said Evans Revere, a former State Department official
with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea.</p>
<p>“Whoever the next U.S. president is, she or he will face a more
sophisticated and dangerous North Korean threat.”</p>
<p>Revere said in an interview that the winner of the U.S. election
would have to find ways to weaken the link between Moscow and Pyongyang
“and demonstrate to Beijing that its ‘partnership without limits’ with
Russia is a dangerous and ill-advised path that will yield no benefits”
for China.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping
declared in May a “new era” in opposition to the U.S. and reaffirmed the
“no limits” partnership that was first announced just days before
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>While China has held back on providing Russia with arms for its war
effort, the United States has accused it of delivering electronic
components and other dual-use items that are keeping Moscow’s arms
industry afloat.</p>
<p>Pyongyang, for its part, denies participating in any arms transfers
to Russia, an act that would violate United Nations sanctions.</p>
<p>But a report this week by Conflict Armament Research, a U.K.-based
group that tracks weapons in armed conflicts, said parts from four North
Korean missiles have been found in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The missiles, examined by Kyiv, are either KN-23 or KN-24, known as
Hwasong-11 short-range missile series, and thought to have been used in
attacks in July and August, the report said.</p>
<p>Pyongyang-Moscow military ties have also been expanded to include
tourism, trade, and economic and technical cooperation.</p>
<p>This makes the use of sanctions less effective as a policy tool to
counter North Korea’s nuclear buildup, according to Gary Samore, former
White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction
during the Obama administration.</p>
<p>“That’s not as much leverage now as it was before because of the
Russian-North Korean relationship,” said Samore. “The U.S. doesn’t have
very strong economic leverage that it can use with North Korea.”</p>
<p>With few obvious policy options available, the two presidential
candidates – former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala
Harris – have largely confined themselves to criticizing each other’s
approach without laying out any specific plans to roll back the North
Korean threat.</p>
<p>At Tuesday night’s televised debate, Harris criticized Trump for
exchanging “love letters with Kim Jong Un” during his presidency while
Trump disapproved of the current administration’s handling of the issue,
saying, “Look at what’s going on in North Korea.”</p>
<p>During his presidency, Trump held three summits with Kim but the
diplomatic effort ultimately failed when Trump refused Kim’s demand for
sanctions relief in exchange for a partial rollback of his nuclear
program.</p>
<p>There have been no formal talks between the two countries since,
although the Biden administration insists it is open to negotiations
without preconditions, a policy that Harris could be expected to
continue if elected.</p>
<p>The Biden administration also maintains that its goal remains the
complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, even as many experts
suggest it is time to acknowledge that Pyongyang will not give up its
weapons and say the international community should focus on
containment.</p>
<p>Samore predicted that a Harris administration would continue to say
that “as an ultimate objective … the U.S. seeks denuclearization in the
long term.”</p>
<p>A second Trump administration, he theorized, may say
“denuclearization is no longer possible” and “accept North Korea as a
nuclear power.”</p>
<p>Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said much would
depend on how the winner of the election decides to work with regional
allies South Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>“In the likely absence of any grand outreach towards Pyongyang,
Harris will have to carefully manage the relationship with ally Seoul,
with a focus for the foreseeable future on maintaining peace and
stability on the peninsula,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that it was “uncertain at this moment” whether Trump would
feel compelled to reach out to Kim and whether he would diminish the
value of the alliances with South Korea and Japan.</p>

<h2 id="us-slams-rt-as-de-facto-arm-of-russian-intelligence">US slams RT
as ‘de facto’ arm of Russian intelligence</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States and some of its allies have launched a
global campaign to undercut efforts by RT and other Russian state-backed
media outlets, accusing them of operating on behalf of the Kremlin’s
intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>The State Department on Friday announced sanctions against two people
and three entities, including RT’s Moscow-based parent company, saying
new intelligence leaves no doubt that they are no longer engaged in
providing anything that resembles news and information.</p>
<p>RT’s parent company and its subsidiaries “are no longer merely fire
hoses of Russian government propaganda and disinformation,” U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at the State
Department.</p>
<p>“They are engaged in covert influence activities aimed at undermining
American elections and democracy, functioning like a de facto arm of
Russia’s intelligence apparatus,” he said, adding the Russian operations
also seek to “meddle in the sovereign affairs of countries around the
world.”</p>
<p>Blinken and other U.S. officials declined to share details about the
new intelligence, saying only that some of it comes from RT employees,
and that it shows how the Russian-controlled television network is
playing a key role in running cyber operations and even acquiring lethal
weapons for Russian troops fighting in Ukraine.</p>
<p>RT quickly ridiculed the U.S. accusations both on social media and in
a response to VOA.</p>
<p>“RT: <em>Lives rent free in the State Department head</em>,” the
outlet posted on X. “We’re running out of popcorn, but we’ll be here
live, laughing hard…”</p>
<p>In response to a query from VOA, RT pointed to comments by
editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan on her Telegram channel.</p>
<p>“American intelligence services have uncovered that we are helping
the front lines,” Simonyan wrote, according to a translation from
Russian. “We’ve been doing this openly, you idiots. Should I send you a
list of what we’ve bought and sent? We regularly publish this, just so
you know.”</p>
<p>The Russian Embassy in Washington has not yet responded to a request
from VOA for comment.</p>
<p>U.S. officials, though, said comments like the ones from RT’s
Simonyan only give more weight to the allegations.</p>
<p>“They’ve admitted it,” said James Rubin, the special envoy for the
State Department’s Global Engagement Center. “They have said they’re
operating under direct instruction of [Russian President] Vladimir
Putin. That’s what they say they’re doing.”</p>
<p>And the U.S. says the intelligence shows those Kremlin-assigned
responsibilities go far beyond what could be considered normal broadcast
operations, including oversight of a crowdsourcing campaign to provide
Russian troops in Ukraine with sniper rifles, body armor, drones, night
vision equipment and other weaponry.</p>
<p>“That’s not what a TV station normally does. That’s what … that’s
what a military entity does,” Rubin said. RT is “a fully fledged member
of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government on
the war in Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The U.S. intelligence also points to Kremlin-directed RT operations
in Argentina, Germany and the South Caucasus – some linked to a Russian
military intelligence cyber team that has been embedded within the
company.</p>
<p>U.S. officials also said evidence shows RT is “almost certainly”
coordinating with traditional Russian intelligence services to meddle in
next month’s presidential elections in Moldova.</p>
<p>“RT is going to be used to try to manipulate an election and, if they
don’t win the election, manipulate a crowd to try to generate violence
for the possibility of overthrowing [the government],” Rubin said.</p>
<p>U.S. officials also called out RT for covert influence operations in
Latin America and Africa that have had serious consequences.</p>
<p>“One of the reasons why so much of the world has not been as fully
supportive of Ukraine as you would think they would be — given that
Russia has invaded Ukraine and violated rule number one of the
international system — is because of the broad scope and reach of RT,”
Rubin said.</p>
<p>The State Department said Friday that it had instructed its diplomats
to share evidence about RT’s efforts with countries around the
world.</p>
<p>“We urge every ally, every partner, to start by treating RT’s
activities as they do other intelligence activities by Russia within
their borders,” Blinken said.</p>
<p>Friday’s sanctions came a little more than a week after the U.S.
acted against what it described as two Russian plots, one of them
involving RT, aimed at undermining the U.S. presidential elections in
November.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice announced the takedown of 32 fake
websites designed by Russia to mimic legitimate news sites, to bombard
U.S. voters with propaganda aimed at building support for Russia in its
war against Ukraine and bolstering support for Republican presidential
candidate and former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The U.S. also unsealed indictments against two RT employees, accusing
them of funneling nearly $10 million to a U.S. company in Tennessee to
promote and distribute English-language material favorable to the
Russian government.</p>
<p>What impact all these actions will have on Russia and RT, however,
remains to be seen.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any evidence that deterrence is working in
this space,” said Margaret Talev, who directs the Syracuse University
Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship in Washington.</p>
<p>“These efforts are getting much more sophisticated,” she told VOA,
adding that Russian influence operations have become adept at seeding
the social media environment and letting audiences do the work.</p>
<p>“One of the biggest drivers of the spread of misinformation and
disinformation is sharing by people who aren’t trying to do anything
wrong,” Talev said. “They’re either amused by something or horrified by
something that comes into their feed, and they hit ‘share.’ And now
someone spread it to you, and you’re spreading it to someone else.”</p>

Regulations are probably coming for the scandal-plagued voluntary carbon
market. After years of
<a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/whats-plaguing-voluntary-carbon-markets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mounting
skepticism</u></a> and reports of
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/04/17/carbon-offsets-flights-airlines/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>greenwashing</u></a>,
governments are now attempting to rein in the historically unchecked web
of platforms, registries, protocols, and verification bodies offering
ways to offset a company’s emissions that vary tremendously in price and
quality. Europe has developed its own rules, the
<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_885" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Carbon
Removal Certification Framework</u></a>, while the Biden administration
earlier this year announced a less comprehensive

of general principles</u></a>. Plus, there are already mandatory carbon
credit schemes around the world, such as California’s cap-and-trade
program and the E.U. Emissions Trading System.
</p>
<p>
“The idea that a voluntary credit should be a different thing than a
compliance credit, obviously doesn’t make sense, right?” Ryan Orbuch,
Lowercarbon Capital’s carbon removal lead, told me. “You want it to be
as likely as possible that the thing you’re buying today is going to
count in a compliance regime.”
</p>
<p>
That’s where the carbon credit certification platform Isometric comes
into play. Founded in 2022, the startup raised $25 million in its seed
round last year, co-led by Lowercarbon and Plural, a European venture
capital firm. It has created a rigorous, scientifically-driven standard
for carbon removal credits, with the intention of becoming the benchmark
that buyers, sellers, and other stakeholders can coalesce around. So
whenever federal standards or compliance regimes do kick in, there will
be no doubt whether Isometric-verified credits are up to snuff.
</p>
<p>
“Isometric was basically founded to say, look, the long-term solution
here is obviously government and regulation, but in the meantime, this
is too important to let the market just keep doing it like this,” Lukas
May, chief commercial officer at Isometric, told me. He believes that
the government’s role in the carbon market should mirror the financial
sector, but instead of preventing insider trading or predatory lending,
federal regulators would make high-level determinations on things like
what types of credits count and how long carbon must be locked away to
count as “permanent removal.” Platforms like Isometric (often referred
to as registries) could then focus on setting more granular,
scientifically specific requirements for particular methods of carbon
removal.
</p>
<p>
The startup aims to separate itself from existing registries, which
include Puro.earth, Verra, and the Gold Standard, in two big ways.
</p>
<p>
First is just a focus on science. May said that 15 of Isometric’s first
25 hires were scientists. Today, the company’s chief scientist is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/jennifer-wilcox-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>J</u><u>ennifer
Wilcox</u></a>, who recently left her position on the leadership team at
the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, housed within the
U.S. Department of Energy. Other registries, he told me, are “filled
with NGO types” and “policy people” who lack the technical background
to, say, evaluate what types rock formations are best for the geological
sequestration of bio-oil or how CO2 fluxes in the soil impact enhanced
rock weathering. These types of in-the-weeds analyses are integral to
establishing stringent protocols to validate the amount of carbon that’s
actually been removed.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, May, Orbuch, and Khaled Helioui, a partner at Plural who
led the firm’s investment in Isometric, all said the company fixes a key
flaw in the voluntary carbon market —- alignment of financial
incentives. Traditionally, carbon removal suppliers pay registries to
certify their credits, which creates an incentive for registries to
overlook lax standards. But Isometric is instead paid a flat fee by the
<em><em>buyers</em></em> for performing verification work on a per-ton
basis.
</p>
<p>
This year, Isometric verified its first credits ever, from the carbon
removal companies
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/vaulted-deep-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>Vaulted
Deep</u></a>, which collects sludgy, organic waste and deposits it
underground, and
<a href="https://charmindustrial.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Charm
Industrial</u></a>, which injects processed biomass into abandoned oil
and gas wells. Credits from these two suppliers were sold to Frontier,
the carbon-removal initiative led by the payments firm Stripe. Just last
week, Frontier identified Isometric as its first and only leading credit
issuer.
</p>
<p>
“What makes Isometric stand out is they’re explicitly focused on durable
CDR [carbon dioxide removal],” Joanna Klitzke, Frontier’s procurement
and ecosystem strategy lead, told me. “Durable” refers to the fact that
Isometric’s projects must sequester CO2 for 1,000 years or more.
“They’re building tech products that make data and reporting
particularly easy for suppliers and for credit management,” she added.
</p>
<p>
Everyone is essentially trying to avoid another scandal like the one
that engulfed rainforest carbon offsets, which were
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jan/18/revealed-forest-carbon-offsets-biggest-provider-worthless-verra-aoe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found
to be largely worthless</u></a>. The industry has thus been shifting
away from more nebulous carbon offsets, which seek to avoid future
emissions by preventing deforestation or funding renewables development,
and towards more concrete, but often more expensive, forms of carbon
removal — think direct air capture,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self"><u>enhanced
rock weathering</u></a>, or
<a href="https://charmindustrial.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>biomass
carbon removal and storage</u></a>, all of which have seen a boom in
investment.
</p>
<p>
“As carbon removal was emerging as a new and potentially very exciting
way to do this stuff, potentially more measurable and more rigorous, we
couldn’t just sit and watch the same registries do the same thing,” May
told me, saying doing so would “destroy trust in the carbon removal
industry before it’s even off the ground.”
</p>
<p>
In a past life, Isometric’s founder and CEO, Eamon Jubbaway, founded a
digital identity verification company for the financial services
industry. This gave investors confidence that he could bring his
expertise in trust-building and verification services to the carbon
removal space.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not a like for like, but there’s a lot of overlap in terms of
actually introducing efficiency, effectiveness, and having technology
really open a market,” Plural’s Helioui told me. “This is not an
endeavor or an opportunity where I would have been necessarily that keen
to back a first-time founder, just because of the complexity of what you
need to manage,” he said. “We’re really talking about market creation.”
</p>
<p>
But May doesn’t expect Isometric to totally dominate other registries.
Just like there are many private banks, May envisions an “ecosystem of
high quality registries,” eventually unified around a set of federal
guardrails. Until then, he believes Isometric’s role is to “set a bar
that is so high that the expectation and norm in the market shifts,”
thus avoiding a race to the bottom where companies are able to greenwash
their image with cheap, low-quality credits.
</p>
<p>
Now, not every company can afford the highest quality credits. And
because of Isometric’s 1,000-year storage requirement,
many<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/reforestation-gap-offsets" target="_self"><u>
cheaper, nature-based projects</u></a>, such as reforestation, are
excluded from its registry, even though there’s
<a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/updates-on-amazons-sustainability-efforts-to-aid-nature-based-solutions-and-carbon-removal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>still
demand for them.</u></a> Orbuch told me that Isometric will continue
adding guidelines for different carbon removal pathways, as it recently
did for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/biochar-carbon-removal-microsoft" target="_self"><u>biochar</u></a>,
a charcoal-like brick that locks up carbon contained within biomass.
</p>
<p>
It’s still early days, and there’s plenty of room for Isometric to grow
alongside the market. After all, it’s only issued
<a href="https://registry.isometric.com/?issuances-before=W3siaXNzdWVkX2F0IjogIjIwMjMtMTItMjNUMTA6NDA6MzYuMTg1NDgxKzAwOjAwIn0sIHsiaWQiOiAiaXNzXzFISkI0NVc5RzFTMDczV0gifV0%3D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>5,350
carbon removal credits</u></a> to date, while
<a href="https://bezerocarbon.com/insights/snapshot-the-current-carbon-removal-market-in-figures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly
two billion credits</u></a> have been issued in the voluntary carbon
market overall.
</p>
<p>
“The whole industry needs to be scaling up,” May told me. “So we need
to, in 10 years time, be, you know, issuing and verifying hundreds of
millions, if not billions, of credits annually.”

<h2 id="haiku-r1beta5-released">Haiku R1/beta5 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s always a lovely day when it’s a Haiku release day – and sadly,
those don’t come very often. Of course, Haiku’s nightlies tend to be
rather solid so an official release isn’t really a must if you want to
use Haiku, but if you were holding out for something more stable: Haiku
has just released its fifth beta, Haiku R1/beta5. We’ve covered most of
the new features and changes as they were developed, but since it’s been
so long since the previous beta, we should cover some of the highlights.
One of the collection of improvements that’s impossible to put in a
screenshot is the performance improvements the successor to BeOS has
received since the release of R1/beta4, and there are many. There’s a
ton of general performance improvements, of course, covering everything
from the kernel to applications, including much better throughput in
TCP, the network stack, which should lift Haiku’s network performance
much closer to that of other, more mature operating systems. There’s
also an overhaul of the user_mutex system, and much more. A great many
performance optimizations were done to the kernel and drivers, including
batching many more I/O operations, avoiding unnecessary locks on
application startup, improved pre-mapping of memory mapped files,
reduced lock contention in page mapping, batched modification of the
global memory areas table (and a different implementation of its
underlying data structure), changes to keep page lists in-order to ease
allocations, temporary buffer allocation performance improvements in hot
I/O paths, support for DT_GNU_HASH in the ELF loader, and more. ↫ Haiku
R1/beta5 release notes Looking at the end user side of things, the
Appearance dialog has been simplified without removing any features or
capabilities, and Haiku now also comes with a dark mode. The little
power/battery widget in Deskbar has also been overhauled to provide more
accurate battery information, and it’ll load automatically if a battery
is detected in the system. Tracker (the file manager) and Icon-O-Matic
have seen improvements, there’s a rewritten FAT driver, a brand new UFS2
driver, and much more. There’s also a ton of new application ports from
the Qt and GTK world, especially if the last time you’ve tried Haiku was
one of the previous betas. Thanks to all of these ports, it’s much more
realistic now to use Haiku as a daily driver. Haiku now also offers
experimental support for .NET and FLTK, which provides further avenues
for ports. This is just a small selection, as there is so much more
contained in this new beta release. If you’ve been running the nightlies
this new beta won’t mean much to you, but if you’ve been out of the
running for a while, Haiku R1/beta5 is a great place to start to see
what the platform has to offer.</p>

US step up top-level military exchanges amid ongoing tension</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — An expected visit to Hawaii by the head of China’s
Southern Theater Command next week will come just days after a
high-ranking Pentagon official attended a defense conference in
Beijing.</p>
<p>The visits, analysts said, are part of an effort to expand high-level
exchanges between the U.S. and China and boost top-level
military-to-military communication. It is unclear, though, how much the
exchanges will do to help avoid miscommunication and keep tensions in
the Indo-Pacific under control, they added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral
Sam Paparo, and the head of the PLA, or People’s Liberation Army,
Southern Theater Command, General Wu Yanan, held a video call for the
first time in years.</p>
<p>The Chinese defense ministry said the two commanders had an “in-depth
exchange of views on issues of common concern” while Paparo urged the
Chinese military “to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive and
potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond.”</p>
<p>Wu is expected to attend a defense conference held by the U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii next week, U.S. defense officials have
confirmed to VOA.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michael Chase, the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of
defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia, is holding defense policy
coordination talks with Chinese defense officials while attending the
annual Xiangshan Security Dialogue held in Beijing this week.</p>
<p>A meeting that took place on the sidelines of the Xiangshan forum was
designed to “underscore the United States’ shared vision for the
region,” according to a U.S. Department of Defense readout Thursday.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has been working to restore communication
between Chinese and American militaries since the U.S. president’s
meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC
summit in California last November.</p>
<p>Chase’s visit to Beijing this week and Wu’s expected reciprocal visit
next week follow a first meeting between U.S. national security adviser
Jake Sullivan and China’s vice chairman of the Central Military
Commission, Zhang Youxia, last month.</p>
<p>During that meeting, Zhang said maintaining military security is “in
line with the common interests of both sides” and Sullivan highlighted
the two nations’ shared responsibility to “prevent competition from
veering into conflict or confrontation.”</p>
<p>Some analysts see a potential for further communication and
engagement between the two militaries.</p>
<p>“I won’t rule out the possibilities that Beijing and Washington may
look to establish a hotline between the two militaries, and whether that
mechanism could be extended to the theater command level remains to be
seen,” Lin Ying-Yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan,
told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>While the resumption of top-level communication allows Beijing and
Washington to avoid miscalculations, other experts say it is unclear
whether China and the U.S. can establish a more sustainable mechanism to
cope with potential crises.</p>
<p>“While having contact and knowing your interlocutors are positive
things during non-crisis times, the real test is whether these contacts
can hold back any unintended escalation when incidents happen,” said Ian
Chong, a political scientist at the National University of
Singapore.</p>
<p>Chong said since theater commanders from the U.S. and China oversee
implementing rather than formulating policies, it is unclear whether the
latest development can become established protocols.</p>
<p>“If there’s a persistence of [maintaining military-to-military
communication], then it would suggest that it has become a policy,” he
told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>Tensions remain high over contentious issues</p>
<p>Tensions remain high between China and the U.S. over a range of
issues, including the repeated collision between Chinese and Philippine
vessels near disputed reefs in the South China Sea and Beijing’s
increased maneuvers in waters and airspace near Taiwan and Japan.</p>
<p>During the Xiangshan forum, Lieutenant General He Lei, the former
vice president of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, characterized
the Philippines’ attempt to safeguard its territorial claims in the
South China Sea as “a unilateral change of the status quo” while
accusing the U.S. of undermining security across the Taiwan Strait by
selling weapons to Taiwan.</p>
<p>“The Chinese people and the People’s Liberation Army will never allow
any external forces to interfere in China’s internal affairs or invade
China’s territory,” he told Chinese state broadcaster CGTN in an
interview.</p>
<p>Some analysts say there are limits to what military-to-military
communications can do to ease tensions over what are essentially
political disagreements.</p>
<p>“The military tension is only a manifestation of their political
differences over Taiwan and the South China Sea, so if their
disagreements are not resolved, the military tension is very unlikely to
see a permanent resolution,” Yun Sun, China program director at the
Stimson Center in Washington, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>With less than two months until the U.S. presidential election, Chong
in Singapore said Beijing and Washington’s recent efforts may be an
attempt to lay the foundation for bilateral military-to-military
communication to be continued after the November election.</p>
<p>“On the Democrat side, if some of the current team stays [after
November], perhaps we would see this momentum continue,” he told
VOA.</p>
<p>“On the Republican side, things are a bit messier, because you have
those who prefer the isolationist approach, those who advocate a
containment approach in Asia, and people who talk about competing
against China to win,” Chong added.</p>
<p>Sun said if Donald Trump wins the election in November, Beijing will
expect instability in bilateral relations and be prepared for the
military relationship to be affected.</p>

ChromeOS. Updating your apps to support adaptive layouts, more robust
multitasking, and adaptive inputs will ensure your apps work well on
large screens across the Android ecosystem. ↫ Francesco Romano on the
Android Developers Blog The long-running saga of Google trying to
develop proper freeform windowing support for Android seems to finally
be bearing fruit. Countless attempts came and went, usually in developer
releases, hidden behind flags, rarely, if ever talked about, but now
it’s finally not only part of an Android beta release anyone with a
Pixel Tablet can install and try out, Google is also openly talking
about and touting it as a feature, so we might actually perhaps maybe
see this in a non-beta release at some point. The way it works is both
surprising and rather unsurprising. Instead of the Apple approach, which
seems to entail a deep disdain for traditional windowing, Google is
pretty much embracing the things we expect a windowing system to have,
from window titlebars with close and maximise widgets, to a traditional
dock-like taskbar permanently available at the bottom of the screen. If
you click or tap on a little downward arrow on the titlebar, you can
choose options like displaying windows side-by-side, much like on
Windows. A very welcome ‘feature’ is the ability to tear off Chrome tabs
and turn them into their own windows, just like in a traditional desktop
environment. Google also opted for an interesting approach that reminds
me somewhat of the “desktop” mode on Windows RT. Since Windows RT was
ARM-based and entirely locked-down, the only classic Win32 applications
you could run were those bundled with Windows as well as Microsoft
Office. To access these, Windows RT would launch a full-screen tablet
application that contained the entire traditional Windows desktop, and
you’d run your classic Win32 applications in there. Android’s new
windowing system seems to be doing something similar: once you enter the
freeform windowing mode, all future applications will also launch as
windows. In the task switcher, however, they’re all contained within a
single “desktop” entry that you can close if you want to. That desktop
entry seems to take the shape of a live view of the “desktop”, including
the various windows you have opened. This way, you can have a dedicated
“desktop” with freeform windows alongside any fullscreen tablet
applications you also happen to be running. It’s perhaps not the most
integrated or elegant approach, but it’s dead-simple and easy to grasp.
This new windowing environment also provides application developers with
the option of allowing multiple instances of a single application to be
launched, say launching two text editor windows side-by-side. This seems
to be a specific property developers need to enable, though, and
considering Android’s tablet adoption history, that’s anything but a
given at this point. Of course, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that
applications need to be able to resize gracefully, too. If you want to
play with it, you’ll need a Pixel Tablet running Android 15 QPR1 Beta 2,
or just use the simulator. I really hope this takes off and developers
support the various APIs for optimal integration (I’m not getting my
hopes up), since proper freeform windowing that doesn’t feel like an
ugly, barely functional hack is something I’ve been wanting on Android
for a long time.</p>

cartel leader ‘El Mayo’ Zambada pleads not guilty to US charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, a powerful leader of Mexico’s
Sinaloa cartel, pleaded not guilty Friday to U.S. narcotics trafficking
charges in a case accusing him of engaging in murder plots, ordering
torture and channeling tons of drugs into the United States.</p>
<p>Participating in a court hearing through a Spanish-language
interpreter, Zambada gave yes-or-no answers to a magistrate’s standard
questions about whether he understood various documents and procedures.
Asked how he was feeling, he said, “Fine, fine.”</p>
<p>His lawyers entered the not guilty plea on his behalf.</p>
<p>Outside court, Zambada attorney Frank Perez said his client wasn’t
contemplating making a deal with the government, and the attorney
expects the case to go to trial.</p>
<p>“It’s a complex case,” he said.</p>
<p>Sought by American law enforcement for more than two decades, Zambada
has been in U.S. custody since July 25, when he landed in a private
plane at an airport outside El Paso, Texas, in the company of another
fugitive cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, according to federal
authorities.</p>
<p>Zambada later said in a letter that he was kidnapped in Mexico and
brought to the U.S. by Guzman Lopez, a son of imprisoned Sinaloa
co-founder Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.</p>
<p>Zambada’s lawyer did not elaborate on those claims Friday.</p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cho ordered Zambada detained until trial.
His lawyers did not ask for bail, and U.S. prosecutors in Brooklyn asked
the judge to detain him.</p>
<p>“He was one of the most, if not the most, powerful narcotics kingpins
in the world,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco Navarro said. “He
co-founded the Sinaloa cartel and sat atop the narcotics trafficking
world for decades.”</p>
<p>Zambada sat quietly as he listened to the interpreter. Leaving court
after the brief hearing, he appeared to accept some help getting out of
a chair, then walked out slowly but unaided.</p>
<p>The 76-year-old had used a wheelchair at a court appearance in Texas
last month. But Perez said after court Friday that Zambada was healthy
and “in good spirits.”</p>
<p>Sketch artists were in the small courtroom, but other journalists
could observe only through closed-circuit video because of a shortage of
seats.</p>
<p>In court and in a letter earlier to the judge, prosecutors said
Zambada presided over a vast and violent operation, with an arsenal of
military-grade weapons, a private security force that was almost like an
army, and a corps of “sicarios,” or hitmen, who carried out
assassinations, kidnappings and torture.</p>
<p>His bloody tenure included ordering the murder, just months ago, of
his own nephew, the prosecutors said.</p>
<p>“A United States jail cell is the only thing that will prevent the
defendant from committing further crimes,” Navarro said.</p>
<p>Zambada also pleaded not guilty to the charges at an earlier court
appearance in Texas. His next court appearance is scheduled for October
31.</p>
<p>According to authorities, Zambada and “El Chapo” Guzman built the
Sinaloa cartel from a regional syndicate into a huge manufacturer and
smuggler of cocaine, heroin and other illicit drugs to the U.S. Zambada
has been seen as the group’s strategist and dealmaker and a less
flamboyant figure than Guzman.</p>
<p>Zambada had never been behind bars until his U.S. arrest in July.</p>
<p>His apprehension has touched off fighting in Mexico between rival
factions in the Sinaloa cartel. Gunfights have killed several
people.</p>
<p>Schools and businesses in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, have
closed amid the fighting. The battles are believed to be between
factions loyal to Zambada and those led by other sons of “El Chapo”
Guzman, who was convicted of drug and conspiracy charges and sentenced
to life in prison in the U.S. in 2019.</p>
<p>It remains unclear why Guzman Lopez surrendered to U.S. authorities
and brought Zambada with him. Guzman Lopez is awaiting trial on a
separate drug trafficking indictment in Chicago, where he has pleaded
not guilty.</p>

id="how-propaganda-outlets-cover-or-ignore-aspects-of-us-election">How
propaganda outlets cover — or ignore — aspects of US election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump met in a
presidential debate on Tuesday, they spoke about a range of foreign
policy issues, including China and Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But while the debate attracted large audiences and coverage in the
United States and Europe, Beijing and Moscow’s state-run media were
relatively quiet on the event.</p>
<p>The minimal coverage is a contrast to the presidential debate between
Joe Biden and Trump in June.</p>
<p>Chinese media</p>
<p>After that debate, Beijing-run outlets — like media around the world
— were flooded with coverage of Biden’s poor performance.</p>
<p>But Harris-Trump coverage was noticeably slimmer in state-run outlets
such as Xinhua, the Global Times and the People’s Daily newspaper, China
media analysts say.</p>
<p>The shift is a subtle but significant distinction, according to China
media analysts, that reflects how the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP,
employs its propaganda apparatus.</p>
<p>The relative lack of coverage wasn’t all that surprising to Kenton
Thibaut, a senior resident China fellow at the Atlantic Council’s
Digital Forensic Research Lab in Washington.</p>
<p>The Chinese government is probably still figuring out how to move
forward following Biden’s abrupt withdrawal, said Thibaut. She believes
that’s a primary reason for the reduced coverage of this week’s
debate.</p>
<p>“This is really reflective of how China handles changes in foreign
policy issues,” Thibaut said. “They just stick to very fact-based
coverage, basically restating what the candidate said, until they — the
propaganda department and such — can figure out basically how to cover
it globally and domestically.”</p>
<p>Another reason for the reduced coverage may have to do with democracy
itself, according to China experts.</p>
<p>“The presidential debate is important for U.S. democracy, and
democracy is always a sensitive topic for the CCP,” Anne-Marie Brady, a
professor and specialist in Chinese politics at the University of
Canterbury in New Zealand, told VOA in an email.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hassid, an Iowa State University professor who specializes
in Chinese media, agreed.</p>
<p>“Chinese media does not like covering democratic successes,” Hassid
told VOA. “Democratic failures are highlighted, but the successes are
not.”</p>
<p>That helps explain the difference between the coverage of the two
debates. During the first debate, which by many accounts was a fiasco,
Biden sounded hoarse and frail, and his repeated fumbles highlighted
concerns over the 81-year-old’s capacity to serve another four-year term
as president.</p>
<p>In coverage of that debate, Chinese state media relied on narratives
about how democracy doesn’t work well, Hassid said.</p>
<p>For instance, Hu Xijin, a Chinese media commentator and former state
media editor, wrote, “Objectively speaking, the low-quality performance
of these two old men was a negative advertisement for Western
democracy.”</p>
<p>By contrast, Hassid said, this week’s debate may have been perceived
as a better display of democracy.</p>
<p>Still, China also didn’t even feature that largely in the latest
debate.</p>
<p>While Harris didn’t go into much detail, she said that “a policy
about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins
the competition for the 21st century.” Trump, meanwhile, has previously
proposed tariffs up to 100% on Chinese products.</p>
<p>When asked about Harris and Trump’s views about tariffs on imports
from China, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Wednesday
said she had no comment.</p>
<p>“The presidential elections are the United States’ own affairs,” she
said. “That said, we are opposed to making China an issue in U.S.
elections.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for China’s Washington embassy replied to VOA’s
request for comment with a similar statement: “On the issue of the U.S.
election, China’s position is consistent and clear. China has no
intention and will not interfere in it. At the same time, we hope that
the U.S. side will not make accusations against China in the
election.”</p>
<p>Russian media</p>
<p>Russia — another propaganda powerhouse — also didn’t offer much
coverage of the debate. “But that doesn’t mean that they don’t drop in
plenty of spin,” according to Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson
University’s Media Forensics Hub.</p>
<p>Based on his analysis of Russian state media coverage of the debate,
Linvill said outlets such as RT and Sputnik were focused on downplaying
Harris and playing up Trump.</p>
<p>There were some outliers, such as a Sputnik article in which a
psychiatrist claimed Harris was trying to “hide her imposter syndrome”
during the debate. But most of the coverage was subtler, Linvill
said.</p>
<p>Articles tended to be anodyne and not necessarily critical of either
side, Linvill said, but they still reveal Moscow’s well-documented
preference for Trump.</p>
<p>U.S. officials are again warning about Russian efforts to influence
this year’s election. Last week, the Justice Department accused two
Russians who work at the Kremlin-backed RT of money laundering by
funneling nearly $10 million to a conservative Tennessee-based media
outlet that is a leading platform for pro-Trump voices.</p>
<p>While it’s important to monitor disinformation in the lead-up to and
during an election, according to Thibaut, the period immediately after
is perhaps even more important, especially if the election is close.</p>
<p>“This is a prime time for threat actors to take advantage of
information, the polarizing narratives, the charged-up atmosphere to
really sow social division,” Thibaut said.</p>
<p>“We have to really remain vigilant after the election as well.”</p>

rivalry for military influence in Africa ramps up</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Johannesburg — While the U.S. was forced to downsize and pull its
troops out of Niger this year, China is increasing its military
cooperation on the continent, recently announcing a plan to spend $140
million to train 6,000 military personnel — a move, a U.S. defense
official said Friday, was for China’s “own economic growth and
benefit.”</p>
<p>Among the many ways that the U.S. and China are competing for
influence in Africa, analysts say military cooperation on the continent
is one that is seeing rising rivalry between the two superpowers.</p>
<p>At a summit that focused on China-Africa cooperation last week,
Chinese President Xi Jinping made the pledge to train the 6,000 military
personnel. He also invited 500 African officers to visit China.</p>
<p>‘Most explicit’ pledge</p>
<p>China has been cooperating with Africa in several areas of security
for years, including participating in U.N. peacekeeping missions,
holding joint military drills, and providing training and education for
officers. However, analysts said the latest announcement was
particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>“This year’s military pledge was by far the most explicit,” Lauren
Johnston, associate professor of China studies at the University of
Sydney, told VOA. “Never seen anything so measured and direct.”</p>
<p>Asked by VOA about whether Xi’s pledge means China is outperforming
the U.S. when it comes to security cooperation on the continent, a
spokesperson for U.S.-Africa Command, or AFRICOM, said: “We recognize
that the PRC is adept at creating opportunities to expand influence on
the continent.”</p>
<p>The PRC is the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s
Republic of China.</p>
<p>“Its long-term vision for Africa is tied to its own economic benefit
and growth,” said the spokesperson, Kelly Cahalan. “The PRC is the
second-largest arms supplier in Africa after Russia, with defense
exports of small arms, missile systems, aerial munitions, naval vessels,
combat aircraft, infantry vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles.”</p>
<p>However, the AFRICOM spokesperson added that the U.S. “would welcome
the PRC’s cooperation on issues such as climate change, global health
security, arms control and non-proliferation.”</p>
<p>Niger exodus</p>
<p>In a blow to Washington earlier this year, the U.S. military was
forced to pull troops out of Niger, after the junta there demanded the
U.S. close its $100 million airbase combatting extremist groups in the
Sahel region.</p>
<p>Since then, the U.S. has been in talks with other West African
nations, including Ivory Coast, Ghana and Benin “as we start to reset
and recalibrate some of our assets,” General Michael Langley commander
of U.S.-Africa Command, or AFRICOM, told journalists in an online press
briefing Thursday.</p>
<p>Langley was speaking from Kenya, after also visiting Somalia to speak
with the government about counter-terrorism efforts against al-Shabab.
He has spent a lot of time on the continent recently, having also
visited a number of North African countries earlier this year.</p>
<p>Asked in the press briefing about China’s influence in Africa,
General Langley said the choice lay with African governments.</p>
<p>“When we have engaged with our African partners, we don’t give them
an ultimatum of who to choose for a security partner,” he said. “All our
activities and our partnership-centric type approach should be
African-led and U.S.-enabled.”</p>
<p>Darren Olivier, director of the conflict research consulting firm
African Defense Review, said the U.S. is trying to shore up support
after the blow it received in West Africa.</p>
<p>“The U.S. was clearly shaken by the junta takeovers in Sahelian
countries like Burkina Faso &amp; Niger and their subsequent ending of
security cooperation and basing agreements,” he said in a written
response to VOA, noting that the U.S. had been criticized for not being
consultative enough with its African partners.</p>
<p>“General Langley’s tour therefore appears to be not just about
shoring up support for new cooperation agreements and basing locations,
but to reinforce the U.S.’s new message of listening first and advising
second,” Olivier added.</p>
<p>Playing the long game</p>
<p>Efforts by the U.S. in Africa come as China is working to grow its
ties as well.</p>
<p>Jana de Kluiver, an analyst with the Institute for Security Studies
based in South Africa, said China was looking to foster long-term
connections with the people who will go on to become Africa’s military
top brass and political elite.</p>
<p>“The 6,000 military personnel trained by China will later on become
higher ranking figures in their respective countries, enhancing
Beijing’s soft power across the continent,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>In 2022, China launched what it called the Global Security
Initiative, or GSI, as a counterpoint to the U.S.-led security order.
One of the main tenets of the initiative is China’s principle of
non-interference.</p>
<p>“As Chinese economic interests expand across the continent, the need
for a stable security environment becomes critical. However, Beijing is
careful to avoid appearing too assertive, as its broader narrative seeks
to contrast with the perceived interventionism of the West,” said the
Institute for Security Studies’ de Kluiver.</p>
<p>African Defense Review’s Olivier said it will be interesting to see
how African nations that are used to Western military support and
training now juggle their options.</p>
<p>If they opt for Chinese training, they could then choose to “silo
their armed forces into units trained by Western countries and units
trained by China, which will have its own impacts from incompatible
doctrines and standards,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>China always positions itself as a no-strings attached ally of Africa
and Olivier said it would also depend where China placed any
pre-conditions on military cooperation.</p>
<p>“Western countries are traditionally skittish about training units
that might commit human rights violations,” he said. “This might provide
the opportunity for some countries frustrated with those restrictions to
turn to Beijing for training instead.”</p>
<p>Base concerns</p>
<p>Washington has also long been concerned about the possibility that
China is looking to establish a second permanent base in Africa. Beijing
already has one on the continent’s east coast, in Djibouti, and is said
to be seeking a foothold in West Africa.</p>
<p>That would give Beijing a military presence across the Atlantic from
America’s East Coast, a move that analysts say would be perceived by the
U.S. as a threat to national security.</p>
<p>China was believed to be looking to Equatorial Guinea, but those
talks have reportedly stalled.</p>
<p>Last week Bloomberg reported the U.S. is assembling a $5 million
security package, including special forces training, for Gabon. The
report quoted unnamed sources, but said the deal was aimed at preventing
China from establishing a base in the country.</p>

id="apple-faces-challenges-in-chinese-market-against-huaweis-tri-fold-phone">Apple
faces challenges in Chinese market against Huawei’s tri-fold phone</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — The U.S.-China technology war is playing out in the
smartphone market in China, where global rivals Apple and Huawei
released new phones this week. Industry experts say Apple, which lacks
home-field advantage, faces many challenges in defending its market
share in the country.</p>
<p>The biggest highlight of the iPhone 16 is its artificial intelligence
system, dubbed Apple Intelligence, while the Huawei Mate XT features
innovative tri-fold screen technology.  But at a starting price of RMB
19,999, about $2,810, the Mate XT will cost about three times as much as
the iPhone 16.</p>
<p>According to data from VMall, Huawei’s official shopping site, nearly
5.74 million people in China preordered the Mate XT as of late Thursday,
5½ days after Huawei began accepting preorders.</p>
<p>But in a survey conducted on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo by
Radio France International, half of the 9,200 respondents said they
would not purchase a Mate XT because the price is prohibitive. An
additional 3,500 said they are not in the market for a new phone
now.</p>
<p>“I suggest that Huawei release some products that ordinary people can
afford,” a Weibo user wrote under the name “Diamond Man Yang Dong
Feng.”</p>
<p>The iPhone 16 is not available for preorder until Friday, but some
e-commerce vendors in China have promised to deliver the new devices to
consumers within half a day to two days of sale.</p>
<p>In the competition between Apple and Huawei, iPhone 16 has some
inherent disadvantages, said Shih-Fang Chiu, a senior industry analyst
at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.</p>
<p>“Apple’s strength is information security and privacy, but this is
difficult to achieve in the Chinese market, where the government can
control the data in China’s market to a relatively high degree. In the
era of AI mobile phones, this will bring challenges to Apple’s
development in the Chinese market,” Chiu said.</p>
<p>Apple’s AI service on its iPhone 16 will roll out at a gradual pace
in different languages, first in English and other languages later this
year. The Chinese version will not be available until 2025.</p>
<p>There are other challenges Apple faces as well, Chiu added, such as
regulatory controls, consumer sentiment favoring local brands and
weakening spending power amid China’s economic slowdown.</p>
<p>According to Counterpoint Research’s statistics, Huawei held a market
share of 15% in the second quarter of 2024, surpassing Apple’s 14%
market share. That compares with Apple’s 17.3% share in 2023 as reported
by the industry research firm International Data Corporation China, or
IDC China.</p>
<p>Ryan Reith, the program vice president for IDC’s Mobile Device
Tracker suite, said in a written response to VOA that the iPhone 16 has
not made significant hardware upgrades and that AI applications alone
are not attractive because consumers have GPT and other AI
solutions.</p>
<p>AI applications are also another hurdle. Analyst Chih-Yen Tai said
iPhone 16’s AI services involve personal data collection, information
application and cloud computing, which will require collaboration with
Chinese service providers.</p>
<p>That, along with the ban on Chinese civil servants and employees at
state-owned enterprises from using their iPhone at work in recent years,
will affect the sales of Apple products, said Tai, the deputy director
of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Evaluation at Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research in Taipei.</p>
<p>“China’s patriotism has led to a strong number of preorders” for
Huawei’s tri-fold phones, Tai said.</p>
<p>“The competitors in China will sell the idea [to consumers] that
iPhones will soon be edged out of the premium smartphone market. So, in
the next stage, the affordable iPhone versions will be the key to
whether it [Apple] can return to China or its previous glorious sales
era,” Tai said.</p>
<p>Tzu-Ang Chen, a senior consultant in the digital technology industry
in Taipei, said use of Huawei’s HarmonyOS operating system surpassed
that of Apple’s iOS in China in the first quarter of this year,
representing China’s determination to “go its own way” and create “one
world, two systems.”</p>
<p>“The U.S.-China technology war has extended to smartphones,” Chen
said. “IPhone sales in China will get worse and worse, obviously because
Huawei is doing better, and coupled with patriotism, Apple’s position in
the hearts of 1.4 billion people will never return.”</p>
<p>He said that as China seeks to develop pro-China markets among member
countries of the Belt and Road Initiative in Southeast Asia, the Middle
East and Africa, China-made mobile phones may become their first
choice.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
When you think of a gas-guzzler, what comes to mind is probably a
gigantic pickup like the Ram 1500 TRX, which
<a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/noframes/46855.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gets</u></a>
a combined 12 miles per gallon, or a sports car like the Ferrari
Daytona, which
<a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=47010" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>manages</u></a>
a less-than-impressive 13 mpg. But you may not think about a vehicle
you’ve likely seen a thousand times: the small trucks driven by most
local mail carriers, known as the
<a href="https://postalmuseum.si.edu/collections/object-spotlight/long-life-vehicle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Grumman
Long Life Vehicle</u></a>. They lived up to their name, since they’ve
been in service since the mid-80s; the newest of them were built 30
years ago. But they get an abysmal 9 miles per gallon, burning fuel by
the tankful and spewing emissions as they go about their appointed
rounds.
</p>
<p>
So after a long and winding
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/28/climate/usps-gas-electric-vehicles-lawsuit.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>journey</u></a>
to a replacement for the LLV, the first of the Postal Service’s Next

<p>
This may not be a widely shared opinion. Indeed, some will find the NGDV
downright ugly, and they won’t exactly be wrong. But the new postal
truck’s
<a href="https://facts.usps.com/whats-new-next-generation-vehicles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>weird
appearance</u></a> — many have remarked that it looks like a duck, or
something from a Richard Scarry
<a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/741716/richard-scarrys-cars-and-trucks-and-things-that-go-by-written-and-illustrated-by-richard-scarry/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>book</u></a>
— is what, I predict, will make it iconic. In addition to bringing a
touch of whimsy to your neighborhood, the NGDV will advance the cause of
vehicle electrification much more than you might expect.
</p>
<p>
Postal delivery vehicles were always
<a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/4/22/21229132/usps-coronavirus-electrify-postal-trucks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
no-brainer</u></a> for electrification: They do a lot of stopping and
starting, they follow fixed routes so they can charge at a single
location, and since the existing fleet uses so much gas, electrifying
them will make a real dent in the nation’s emissions.
</p>
<p>
The old trucks didn’t just add to our nation’s carbon emissions, they
got no love from the workers who drove them. If you’ve noticed your mail
carrier sweating profusely as they bring letters to your door in the
summer, it’s not just because they have to carry that heavy bag up and
down the street. It’s also because their creaky, uncomfortable vehicles
have no air conditioning. In 2024.
</p>
<p>
“It felt like heaven blowing in my face,”
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/postal-service-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-a2ebbfc7afec0eea2e036eef93bee4d9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
one carrier after trying out the NGDV, which does indeed have air
conditioning, along with many of the safety features, including backup
cameras, antilock brakes, and airbags, that are common in modern cars
but the LLVs lacked. The new truck also looks unusual because it solves
many of the problems the old vehicles pose for letter carriers. The
truck had to be tall enough to allow them to stand up in the back, so
they won’t have to hunch over the way they do now. It had to be low to
the ground so they can get in and out easily dozens of times in a shift.
It had to have a big enough windshield for the shortest and tallest
carriers to see out comfortably.

All that meant that the NGDV wound up looking like no other vehicle.
Once they are fully deployed — the current plan is to put 60,000 into
service over the next few years — their unique profile will become
familiar to everyone. And it’s important that this strange electric
vehicle will be associated with the Postal Service. Because people
<em><em>love</em></em> the Postal Service.
</p>
<p>
That might be a surprise given familiar complaints about lines at the
post office. But it turns out that when surveys are taken, the Postal
Service always ranks at or near the top of public approval among federal
agencies.
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/08/12/americans-see-many-federal-agencies-favorably-but-republicans-grow-more-critical-of-justice-department/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A
recent Pew Research poll</u></a> put the USPS’s approval at 72%, behind
only the National Park Service.
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/512585/government-agency-ratings-remain-largely-negative.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Gallup
polls</u></a> show them at the top.
<a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2023-01/RISC-WP-21-002.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A
2020 survey</u></a> by the department’s Inspector General found 91% of
respondents saying they had a positive view of the USPS.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps people have a sense that what the Postal Service
<a href="https://facts.usps.com/table-facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>accomplishes</u></a>
is nothing short of miraculous. They move over 300 million pieces of
mail every day, and deliver to 167 million addresses. They’ll pick up a
letter at your door, take it anywhere in the country by land or air or
water, and deliver it right to your Aunt Myrtle in the space of a few
days — and not for $50 or $100, but for 73 cents. It costs the same
whether that letter is going to Atlanta or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alakanuk,_Alaska" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Alakanuk</u></a>.
As
<a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-2007-title39-section101&num=0&edition=2007" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>U.S.
law</u></a> states, the purpose of the Postal Service is “to bind the
Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and
business correspondence of the people.” The USPS is nothing less than a
national treasure.
</p>
<p>
Maybe people appreciate that, or maybe it’s just that most of us like
getting mail, and our mail carriers are part of our communities (and
usually friendly). In any case, the new electric vehicles will be
associated with all the positive feelings people have about the USPS.
</p>
<p>
Which is why it’s fine — and maybe even better — that the NGDV is
odd-looking, or even ugly (but in a charming way). One prevailing theory
about EV adoption — advanced by Tesla’s Elon Musk and embodied in other
vehicles like the Ford F-150 Lightning — is that the way to get people
to buy EVs is to make EVs that are <em><em>cool</em></em>. It’s a valid
perspective, but another way to think about the long-term goal of
transportation electrification is that EVs ought to be in as many places
and as many forms as possible. If you want to normalize them, what
better way than to have a funky-looking EV rolling down your street
every day, delivering mail to your door?
</p>
<p>
It may be a while before you spot an NGDV in your neighborhood; among
other things, it will take time to install the charging infrastructure
at all the postal facilities necessary to electrify the entire delivery
fleet. After all, one of the things that makes the Postal Service such a
vital part of our national life is that it touches Americans, and
delivers to them, no matter how far-flung they are. At least at first,
we may be more likely to see electric delivery vehicles in big cities
than in remote rural areas.
</p>
<p>
But before long, the NGDV could become the most widely recognized EV in
the country, and one that people associate with service, community,
efficiency, and patriotism. And yes, they look weird. Which is part of
what makes them great.

California mountain town walloped by blizzard is now threatened by
wildfire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RUNNING SPRINGS, California — In the Southern California mountain
town of Running Springs, residents live between two scenic lake resorts
— a seemingly serene spot but one also caught between the swings of
devastating winter snowstorms and menacing summer wildfires.</p>
<p>Niko Rynard is currently evacuated from his home due to the Line
Fire, which has charred 58 square miles (150 square kilometers) since
the weekend.</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago, the director of the Running Springs Area
Chamber of Commerce raced down the mountains during a break in the
relentless snowfall his neighbors came to call “Snowmageddon.” Roads
were blocked for days.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old, who moved to the area nine years ago from the East
Coast, is now staying with friends nearby but said others are shelling
out hundreds of dollars to cram into hotel rooms until it’s safe to
return.</p>
<p>The blaze is one of three major wildfires that have ravaged the
mountains east of Los Angeles, destroying dozens of homes and forcing
the evacuations of thousands of people. While California is only now
confronting the height of wildfire season, the state already has seen
nearly three times as much acreage burn than during all of 2023.</p>
<p>Much of this, Rynard said, “comes with the territory” and is part of
living in a beautiful area. He said long-time residents have told him
the massive wildfires are cyclical, much like the snow.</p>
<p>To add to people’s rattled nerves, Southern California was rocked by
a 4.7-magnitude earthquake Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Running Springs is dubbed the “gateway to the San Bernardino
Mountains” and perched more than a mile high. The town was among the
communities snowed in when a blizzard walloped the area in 2023. Now,
the community has been doused with bright fire-red retardant to protect
it.</p>
<p>“It can be tough to live in these environments,” said Dawn Rowe, a
San Bernardino County supervisor whose district covers mountain
communities. “It’s beautiful — a lot of people come to visit, and they
find they might want to relocate for one reason or another. I would
encourage everybody to spend an amount of time doing their due
diligence.”</p>
<p>The Line Fire is burning through dense vegetation that grew after two
back-to-back wet winters that included snowstorms that caused tree
branches to break, leaving behind a lot of “dead and down fuel,” said
Cal Fire Operations Section Chief Jed Gaines. Another wildfire
threatened the mountain community of Wrightwood, about a 50-mile
(80-kilometer) drive to the west.</p>
<p>The fires have threatened tens of thousands of homes and other
structures across Southern California since they escalated during a
triple-digit heat wave over the weekend. Cooler weather was helping
firefighters slowly gain the upper hand in battling the blazes. No
deaths have been reported, but at least a dozen people, mainly
firefighters, have been treated for injuries, mostly heat-related,
authorities said.</p>
<p>In one daring rescue caught on video, Cal Fire Riverside County
Battalion Chief Mike Martinez saved a lone woman walking within feet of
the Airport Fire in Orange County, driving his SUV up to the edge of the
blistering flames so she could enter the vehicle.</p>
<p>“This is one of those moments … you hope you never come across,” he
told the Los Angeles Times. “I’ve been doing this for almost 30 years.
We’re used to extreme fire behavior, but to see a civilian walking down
the middle of the street was surreal.”</p>
<p>Jason Anderson, district attorney for San Bernardino County, said
Thursday that nine arson-related charges have been filed against a
suspect accused of starting the Line Fire.</p>
<p>“This is particularly galling in a community that unfortunately over
the last couple of years has dealt with the scourge of wildfires,” he
told reporters, adding that the suspect’s vehicle has been linked to
three areas where fires were started.</p>
<p>The suspect is due to be arraigned in court on Friday.</p>
<p>The full extent of the damage caused by the wildfires remains
unclear. The three blazes are:</p>
<p>— The Airport Fire in Orange County, which has burned more than 36
square miles (93 square kilometers). The fire was 5% contained Thursday
morning and was reportedly sparked by workers using heavy equipment in
the area. Ten firefighters and two residents were injured in the blaze,
according to the Orange County Fire Authority. The fire has been
difficult to tame because of the steep terrain and dry conditions — and
because some areas hadn’t burned in decades.</p>
<p>— The Line Fire in the San Bernardino National Forest, which was 18%
contained Thursday and has threatened more than 65,000 homes. The blaze
has injured three firefighters.</p>
<p>— The Bridge Fire east of Los Angeles, which grew tenfold in a day
and has burned 80 square miles (207 square kilometers), torched at least
33 homes and six cabins, and forced the evacuation of 10,000 people. The
cause of the fire is not yet known. It remained 0% contained
Thursday.</p>
<p>In northern Nevada, the worst danger appears to have passed near
Reno, where a wildfire on the Sierra’s eastern front forced 20,000
evacuations over the weekend. The blaze closed all schools for four days
and threatened to burn over the top of the mountains into the Lake Tahoe
basin.</p>
<p>Part of the state highway from Reno to Tahoe remained closed
Thursday. Authorities further relaxed evacuation orders after 600
firefighters held fire lines despite winds gusting up to 70 mph (112
kph) the day before and bolstered containment of the 9-square-mile
(23-square-kilometer) Davis Fire, now estimated at 37%. Most of the
8,000 residents that began the day under evacuation orders were
downgraded to evacuation warnings, allowing them to begin to return to
their homes.</p>
<p>“All containment lines … are holding at this time,” Jason Clawson, an
operations section chief for the federal firefighting team, said at a
briefing in Reno late Thursday. “Absolutely no concerns. We have crews,
equipment, engines all spread out around the entire fire.”</p>

<p>
China’s top legislature has approved a plan to raise the retirement age
as the country faces an aging workforce. It’s the first adjustment in
decades, one that many economists say is long overdue — but it’s not
universally popular. Plus, the current economic snapshot as the Fed
prepares for a crucial interest rate decision. And later, is canned
spaghetti carbonara a delicious innovation from Heinz or, as some
critics call it, an abomination?

id="analysts-say-vietnam-officials-us-trip-could-set-path-to-c-130-deal">Analysts
say Vietnam officials US trip could set path to C-130 deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HO CHI MINH CITY — Analysts say this week’s visit to Washington by
Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang shows advances in cooperation
between the two countries, despite rising Vietnamese nationalism that
may indicate rising anti-American sentiment in Vietnam.</p>
<p>A U.S.-based analyst told VOA on September 12 that Giang’s trip set
the groundwork for Hanoi to potentially purchase military cargo planes
from the United States this year.</p>
<p>Giang met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on
Monday. [September 9] Both leaders “reaffirmed the importance of the
U.S.-Vietnam partnership,” the Defense Department said in a statement,
and noted the one-year anniversary of the elevation of the countries’
ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest tier in
Hanoi’s diplomatic hierarchy.</p>
<p>The leaders also underscored the importance of working together to
address the lasting impacts of the U.S.-Vietnam War. Austin announced
that the U.S. would budget $65 million over the next five years to
complete the decontamination of Bien Hoa airbase of dioxin, bringing the
total from department to $215 million. The airbase was the primary
storage site for the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the U.S.-Vietnam
War and remains an environmental and public health hazard for those
nearby.</p>
<p>Andrew Wells-Dang, who leads the Vietnam War Legacies and
Reconciliation Initiative at the United States Institute of Peace, told
VOA by phone on September 5 that diplomatic visits are key to advancing
war-remediation efforts, including finding and identifying the remains
of missing soldiers. He said that along with the U.S. visit of Deputy
Defense Minister Vo Minh Luong in July, visits from authorities provide
“opportunity for them to have high level support.”</p>
<p>Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington
and an expert on Southeast Asia, said joint war-reconciliation efforts
also set the groundwork for defense cooperation more broadly.</p>
<p>“The United States is very pleased with the growth in bilateral
defense relations, and it started from very low levels and was built on
humanitarian missions,” Abuza said during the August 29 call.</p>
<p>“We’ve just continued to build on that,” he added.</p>
<p>Cargo planes</p>
<p>Reuters reported in July that Hanoi was considering purchasing
Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes from the U.S., according to unnamed
sources.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based analyst, who asked that his name to be withheld
because he has not been cleared to discuss the topic, said the C-130
deal was discussed but not finalized during Giang’s visit. The analyst
said the deal was held back by the “massive [U.S.] bureaucracy” and
because solidifying the purchase during the Washington visit would be
“too inflammatory for the Chinese.”</p>
<p>Ian Storey, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in
Singapore, noted Vietnam’s delicate diplomatic balancing act,
illustrated by Giang’s travel itinerary before the Washington trip.</p>
<p>“Vietnam aims to keep its relations with the major powers in
balance,” he wrote in an email on August 30. “As such, Vietnamese
Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited Russia and China in August.”</p>
<p>Storey added that the purchase of C-130 planes would not pose a
threat to China in its maritime territorial disputes with Vietnam.</p>
<p>“C-130 aircraft would enable the Vietnamese to transport troops and
supplies to its occupied atolls in the South China Sea, but these assets
are non-strategic and won’t shift the dynamics in the South China Sea,”
he wrote.</p>
<p>Nguyen The Phuong, a maritime security expert at the University of
New South Wales Canberra, said the C-130 purchase would be a “symbolic
move.”</p>
<p>“Vietnam will try to explore more areas of security and defense
cooperation between Vietnam and the United States to upgrade to a
higher, more meaningful level,” he told VOA on August 30. “The C-130
would be the symbol of that kind of evolving relationship,” he said.</p>
<p>Phuong said a C-130 is a likely entry point as there is still
mistrust between the former foes regarding lethal weapons, and the deal
would not rankle China too much.</p>
<p>“It could be quite advantageous for Vietnam,” he said of a potential
C-130 purchase. “Vietnam can improve its relationship with the United
States, and at the same time, we could not anger China because Vietnam
would just buy non-lethal weapons.”</p>
<p>Rising nationalism</p>
<p>Although there are positive signs to improving Hanoi-Washington
relations, there have also been recent instances of anti-Western
sentiment that could be an impediment to the countries relations, Phuong
said.</p>
<p>Fulbright University Vietnam, which has significant backing from the
United States, is facing accusations of fomenting a “color revolution,”
similar to the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics.</p>
<p>On August 21, Vietnam National Defense TV aired a critique of
Fulbright for allegedly not displaying the Vietnamese flag at a
graduation ceremony and facilitating a color revolution.</p>
<p>The report has since been taken down, but Phuong said the Fulbright
issue and other recent incidents show tension between Vietnam’s
conservative and liberal factions.</p>
<p>“It’s a presentation of a continuous struggle between different
factions, one conservative and one liberal,” Phuong said.</p>
<p>Abuza said that Vietnamese authorities may be attempting to tighten
control ahead of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War in
1975.</p>
<p>“Next April is the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon,” he said.
“The Vietnamese want to control that narrative 100%. There are a lot of
sensitivities.”</p>
<p>Along with the Fulbright incident, Phuong pointed to recent uproar
around Vietnamese celebrities who were pictured with the South Vietnam
flag while traveling to the United States. In addition, a Vietnamese
high school student faced cyber bullying and was summoned by police
after posting in September that he wanted to leave the country and would
“probably never see the [Communist] Party positively again.”</p>
<p>“There’s extreme nationalism in Vietnam at the moment,” Phuong said.
“It’s against Western values.”</p>

vaguely gestures in the general direction of giving security vendors
more userspace tools</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>The consequences of the massive CrowdStrike failure for Windows are
slowly coming into focus. Microsoft recently held a security summit with
some of the large security software vendors, and the company is making
several rather vague promises about what it’s going to do to make sure
an incident like CrowdStrike never happens again. A key part of these
promises is the realisation that security software really shouldn’t be
running in the kernel, and to make that possible, MIcrosoft will need to
add several security features in userspace. Both our customers and
ecosystem partners have called on Microsoft to provide additional
security capabilities outside of kernel mode which, along with SDP, can
be used to create highly available security solutions. At the summit,
Microsoft and partners discussed the requirements and key challenges in
creating a new platform which can meet the needs of security vendors. ↫
David Weston at the Windows Blogs This is easier said than done, as
moving things from kernel to userspace tends to incur a performance
penalty, as well as making it harder to detect software with bad
intentions early enough. Microsoft is going to have do some serious
reworking of both the kernel and userspace when it comes to security
before it’ll be able to completely close up the kernel and make it
impossible for security software to mess around in kernelspace.
Microsoft doesn’t offer any concrete steps or measures quite yet, so
we’ll have to wait and see just how far they’re willing to go. There’s
really not much else to say at this point – empty platitudes, vague
promises, and tons of marketing speak don’t secure an operating system,
after all.</p>

<li>Global warming triggered a mega-tsunami that made the Earth vibrate
for days
</h3>
<p>
Back in September of last year, seismic sensors all over the world began
detecting strange signals, the source of which researchers couldn’t
identify. For nine days, the whole Earth appeared to vibrate at regular
90-second intervals. Now, scientists say they’ve figured out what
happened: A massive landslide in Greenland, caused by a melting glacier,
sent huge volumes of debris plummeting into a fjord and triggered a
mega-tsunami. The energy from the wave remained trapped in the fjord for
nine days, the water sloshing back and forth and sending vibrations
rippling out across the entire globe. Here you can see before and after
pictures of the glacier and the mountain:

explicitly link the event to climate change. Warming global temperatures
caused the glacier to become too thin to support the mountain, so it
collapsed. And they say there will be more events like these. “As we

<li>White House to host first Extreme Heat Summit today
</h3>
<p>
The White House today will host its first-ever Extreme Heat Summit,
where President Biden’s National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi will issue an
“Extreme Heat Call to Action,” urging leaders to step up their efforts
to protect communities from the dangers of rising temperatures brought
on by climate change. The summit comes on the heels of the hottest
summer ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere, and as the West Coast
reels from wildfires made worse by drought and a record-breaking heat
wave.
</p>
<p>
The summit will gather a variety of stakeholders – including emergency
responders and health-care workers – to share takeaways and lessons from
2024’s extreme heat season, discuss how the government is helping and
could help more, and identify gaps and opportunities for building
extreme heat resilience ahead of next year. The White House will also
announce a new “Community Heat Action Checklist” to serve as a roadmap
to help leaders develop extreme heat plans.
</p>
<p>
“Climate-fueled extreme heat waves are showing up like wrecking balls in
our communities, silently wreaking havoc on lives and livelihoods,”
Zaidi said in a statement. “We recognize that this is climate change in
action, and in response are taking a comprehensive approach to
protecting both our people and infrastructure.” Investments from the
Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for helping
states adapt to the effects of climate change, including extreme heat,
total more than $50 billion.

takes stock of state efforts to ditch diesel-powered school buses for
electric fleets. Both federal and state funding is available to help
with this transition. The report, from the Environment America Research
and Policy Center and U.S. PIRG Education Fund, finds that California
has the most “committed” electric school buses – that is, buses that
have been awarded, ordered, delivered, or are already operational. The
state has 1,777 e-buses up and running or ready to deploy, and is still
waiting on nearly 2,000 more. These buses will serve more than 63,000
students. Also in the top five are New York, Illinois, Florida, and
Pennsylvania, but they each trail California by quite a lot. Wyoming and
Idaho are the only states with zero electric school buses. The report
has lots of recommendations and tools to help school districts upgrade
their fleets. It also urges students to pressure school boards to commit
to making the switch.

to</a> the <em>Financial Times</em>. Typical inhalers rely on
propellants made from hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, to deliver
life-saving drugs to users. But HFCs are potent greenhouse gases that
are more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the
atmosphere. Pharma giant GSK estimates its Ventolin inhaler accounted
for nearly half of the company’s global carbon footprint in 2022,
releasing the equivalent of 4.6 million metric tons of CO2. It’s
developing a new inhaler that could have a 90% lower carbon footprint.
Similarly, AstraZeneca has a new inhaler in the works that could cut 1.3
million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions annually. Both companies
are trying to file for regulatory approval either by the end of 2024, or
early next year.

<h2 id="white-house-takes-aim-at-chinese-fast-fashion">White House takes
aim at Chinese fast fashion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The White House said on Thursday it is acting on
Democratic lawmakers’ demands to close what they see as a legal loophole
that allows manufacturers — most from China — to dodge tariffs on
low-priced goods and flood the U.S. with illegal and unsafe
products.</p>
<p>The Biden administration is targeting the “de minimis” exemption,
which allows parcels valued at less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty
free. More than 1 billion such parcels entered the U.S. in fiscal 2023,
U.S Customs and Border Protection said.</p>
<p>White House officials attribute the more than fivefold increase from
several years ago to the growth of Chinese e-commerce platforms such as
Shein and Temu, and administration officials name-checked both of those
popular fast-fashion retailers in a briefing with journalists on
Thursday.</p>
<p>Daleep Singh, deputy national security adviser for international
economics, said these moves to close the loophole would have a big
effect on Chinese apparel, and “will drastically reduce the number of
shipments entering through the de minimis exemption.”</p>
<p>This would likely hamper Americans’ ability to score items like an $8
T-shirt – available in a range of colors – that features a gunslinging,
pants-wearing cartoon cowboy duck who proclaims, “you just yee’d your
last haw.” Or a $6 crop top that reads, in English, LIVE LAUGH LOBOTOMY.
Or an $8 bra made of two fuzzy, dead-eyed cat faces shorn of their
noses, mouths, whiskers and facial expressions, strung together and tied
halter-style around the neck. Or an $8 item that can only be described
as a business-formal bra, as it is made entirely of ties. It is
available in a patchwork of leopard-, zebra- and tiger-print ties,
presumably for a formal office that is animal themed.</p>
<p>Singh added that the administration also seeks to tighten information
collection requirements and consumer safety standards – and block
products that don’t make the cut. And further, he said, the White House
is calling on Congress to pass a law this year to “comprehensively
reform the de minimis exemption.”</p>
<p>In a Wednesday letter, 126 House Democrats urged the president to use
his executive authority, saying they could not act “amid interminable
stagnation in Congress that has precluded legislation from passing.”</p>
<p>“While lawmakers would rather see the de minimis issue dealt with
legislatively, the Democrats on the call said their patience was wearing
thin,” the letter read. “Despite the fact that the concept of de minimis
reform has engendered broad bipartisan support, politicking has
precluded a concrete resolution.”</p>
<p>Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, one of the initiative’s
leaders, expressed concerns over fast fashion’s documented use of forced
labor to make their cut-rate clothing. Rights group Amnesty
International has reported that Shein, in particular, upholds
“questionable labor and human rights standards.”</p>
<p>Shein’s model, the group says, leans on subcontracting the making of
garments, which leaves no room for transparency or accountability for
worker conditions, and gives workers no right to unionize or
assemble.</p>
<p>Navtej Dhillon, deputy director of the National Economic Council,
also said the moves address concerns over fentanyl shipments and for
declining U.S. industry.</p>
<p>“Some foreign companies are attempting to use this pathway to ship
illegal and dangerous products for our health, avoid our health and
safety and consumer protection laws, and evade tariffs to undermine
American manufacturers,” he said. “Textile and apparel manufacturing
supports tens of thousands of jobs in key states like Georgia and North
Carolina. These American workers and manufacturers deserve to compete on
a level playing field.”</p>
<p>The congressional group pushing the administration cited approval
from law enforcement and industry groups.</p>
<p>“The de minimis loophole is severely exacerbating our nation’s opioid
crisis,” said Bill Johnson, executive director of the National
Association of Police Organizations. “Closing it would help staunch the
flow of fentanyl and other narcotics coming across our borders and help
safeguard the lives of our children, families, and friends.”</p>
<p>And Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile
Organizations, said the industry group “strongly supports closing the de
minimis loophole,” noting the closure of 18 textile plants in the U.S.
in the past year.</p>
<p>“De minimis is a free trade agreement for the world at the expense of
U.S. manufacturers, retailers, and consumers,” she said in a statement.
“Shockingly, it has now become a black market for dangerous products
facilitating fentanyl, precursors and pill presses. De minimis is
destruction.”</p>
<p>Shein said last year that they support “responsible reform” of the
policy but did not give precise recommendations.</p>
<p>“The de minimis exemption needs a complete makeover to create a level
playing field for all retailers,” SHEIN Executive Vice Chairman Donald
Tang said in a statement. “At the same time, American consumers deserve
to know that the products they purchase are authentic and ethically
produced. We believe de minimis reform can and should achieve both.”</p>

and British leaders meet as Ukraine pushes to ease weapons
restrictions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — United States President Joe Biden and British Prime
Minister Keir Starmer are meeting Friday amid an intensified push by
Ukraine to loosen restrictions on using weapons provided by the U.S. and
Britain to strike Russia. </p>
<p>The talks come amid signs that the White House could be moving toward
a shift in its policy, and as Russia’s President Vladimir Putin warned
that Ukraine’s use of long-range weapons would put NATO at war with
Moscow. </p>
<p>Ukrainian officials renewed their pleas to use Western-provided
long-range missiles against targets deeper inside Russia during this
week’s visit to Kyiv by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.K.
Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Blinken said he had “no doubt” that Biden
and Starmer would discuss the matter during their visit, noting the U.S.
has adapted and “will adjust as necessary” as Russia’s battlefield
strategy has changed. </p>
<p>The language is similar to what Blinken said in May, shortly before
the U.S. allowed Ukraine to use American-provided weapons just inside
Russian territory. The distance has been largely limited to cross-border
targets deemed a direct threat out of concerns about further escalating
the conflict. </p>
<p>While the issue is expected to be at the top of the leaders’ agenda,
it appeared unlikely that Biden and Starmer would announce any policy
changes during this week’s visit, according to two U.S. officials
familiar with planning for the leaders’ talks who spoke on condition of
anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the private
deliberations. </p>
<p>In addition to Blinken, Biden also has hinted a change could be
afoot. In an exchange with reporters earlier this week about whether he
was ready to ease weapons restrictions on Ukraine, he responded, “We’re
working that out now.” </p>
<p>Putin warned Thursday that allowing long-range strikes “would mean
that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries are at
war with Russia. … If this is so, then, bearing in mind the change in
the very essence of this conflict, we will make appropriate decisions
based on the threats that will be created for us.” </p>
<p>His remarks were in line with the narrative the Kremlin has actively
promoted since early in the Ukraine war, accusing NATO countries of
de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. </p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Putin warned that Russia could provide
long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets in response to
NATO allies allowing Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian
territory, saying it “would mark their direct involvement in the war
against the Russian Federation, and we reserve the right to act the same
way.” </p>
<p>Starmer, in response to the Russian leader’s Thursday comments, said
on his way to the U.S. that Britain does not seek any conflict with
Russia. </p>
<p>“Russia started this conflict. Russia illegally invaded Ukraine.
Russia could end this conflict straight away,” Starmer told reporters.
“Ukraine has the right to self-defense and we’ve obviously been
absolutely fully supportive of Ukraine’s right to self-defense — we’re
providing training capability, as you know.” </p>
<p>“But we don’t seek any conflict with Russia — that’s not our
intention in the slightest,” Starmer said. </p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pressed U.S. and allied
military leaders to go much further. He argues that the U.S. must allow
Ukraine to target Russian air bases and launch sites far from the border
as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine’s electricity grid and
utilities ahead of the coming winter. </p>
<p>Zelenskyy also wants more long-range weaponry from the United States,
including the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, for strikes
in Russia. </p>
<p>ATACMS wouldn’t be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from
long-range Russian glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300
kilometers (185 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS’ reach, said Lt. Col.
Charlie Dietz, Pentagon spokesperson. </p>
<p>American officials also don’t believe they have enough of the weapon
systems available to provide Ukraine with the number to make a
substantive difference to conditions on the ground, one of the U.S.
officials said. </p>
<p>During a meeting of allied defense ministers last week, Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin said he did not believe providing Ukraine with
long-range weapon systems would be a game-changer in the grueling war.
He noted that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with
its own internally produced systems, including drones. </p>
<p>“I don’t believe one capability is going to be decisive, and I stand
by that comment,” Austin said. </p>
<p>“As of right now, the policy has not changed,” Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder,
Pentagon press secretary, said Thursday. </p>
<p>Starmer said he was visiting Washington for “strategic meetings to
discuss Ukraine and to discuss the Middle East.” It’s the prime
minister’s second meeting with Biden since his center-left government
was elected in July. </p>
<p>It comes after Britain last week diverged from the U.S. by suspending
some arms exports to Israel because of the risk they could be used to
break international law. Both countries have downplayed their
differences over the issue. </p>
<p>Biden and Starmer’s meeting also comes ahead of this month’s annual
meeting of global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly. The
Oval Office meeting was scheduled in part to help the two leaders
compare notes on the war in Ukraine, languishing efforts to get a
cease-fire deal in Gaza and other issues ahead of the U.N. meeting. </p>
<p>The White House also has sought in recent days to put a greater
emphasis on the nexus between the war in Ukraine and conflict in the
Middle East sparked after Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza
launched attacks on Israel on Oct. 7. </p>
<p>The Biden administration said this week that Iran recently delivered
short-range ballistic weapons to Russia to use against Ukraine, a
transfer that White House officials worry will allow Russia to use more
of its arsenal for targets far beyond the Ukrainian front line while
employing Iranian warheads for closer-range targets. </p>
<p>In turn, the U.S. administration says Russia has been tightening its
relationship with Iran, including by providing it with nuclear and space
technology. </p>
<p>“This is obviously deeply concerning,” White House national security
spokesperson John Kirby said of the missile transfer. “And it certainly
speaks to the manner in which this partnership threatens European
security and how it illustrates Iran’s destabilizing influence now
reaches well beyond the Middle East.”</p>

id="boeing-factory-workers-go-on-strike-after-rejecting-contract-offer">Boeing
factory workers go on strike after rejecting contract offer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — Aircraft assembly workers walked off the job early Friday
at Boeing factories near Seattle after union members voted
overwhelmingly to go on strike and reject a tentative contract that
would have increased wages by 25% over four years.</p>
<p>The strike started at 12:01 a.m. PDT, less than three hours after the
local branch of the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers announced 94.6% of voting workers rejected the
proposed contract and 96% approved the work stoppage, easily surpassing
a two-thirds requirement.</p>
<p>The labor action involves 33,000 Boeing machinists, most of them in
Washington state, and is expected to shut down production of the
company’s best-selling airline planes. The strike will not affect
commercial flights but represents another setback for the aerospace
giant, whose reputation and finances have been battered by manufacturing
problems and multiple federal investigations this year.</p>
<p>The striking machinists assemble the 737 Max, Boeing’s best-selling
airliner, along with the 777, or “triple-seven” jet, and the 767 cargo
plane at factories in Renton and Everett, Washington. The walkout likely
will not stop production of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which are built by
nonunion workers in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The machinists make $75,608 per year on average, not counting
overtime, and that would rise to $106,350 at the end of the four-year
contract, according to Boeing.</p>
<p>However, the deal fell short of the union’s initial demand for pay
raises of 40% over three years. The union also wanted to restore
traditional pensions that were axed a decade ago but settled for an
increase in Boeing contributions to employee’s 401(k) retirement
accounts.</p>
<p>Outside the Renton factory, people stood with signs reading,
“Historic contract my ass” and “Have you seen the damn housing prices?”
Car horns honked and a boom box played songs such as Twisted Sister’s
We’re Not Gonna Take It and Taylor Swift’s Look What You Made Me Do.</p>
<p>Boeing responded to the strike announcement by saying it was “ready
to get back to the table to reach a new agreement.”</p>
<p>“The message was clear that the tentative agreement we reached with
IAM leadership was not acceptable to the members. We remain committed to
resetting our relationship with our employees and the union,” the
company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Very little has gone right for Boeing this year, from a panel blowing
out and leaving a gaping hole in one of its passenger jets in January to
NASA leaving two astronauts in space rather sending them home on a
problem-plagued Boeing spacecraft.</p>
<p>As long as the strike lasts, it will deprive the company of
much-needed cash it gets from delivering new planes to airlines. That
will be another challenge for new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg, who six
weeks ago was given the job of turning around a company that has lost
more than $25 billion in the last six years and fallen behind European
rival Airbus.</p>
<p>Ortberg made a last-ditch effort to salvage a deal that had unanimous
backing from the union’s negotiators. He told machinists Wednesday that
“no one wins” in a walkout and a strike would put Boeing’s recovery in
jeopardy and raise more doubt about the company in the eyes of its
airline customers.</p>
<p>“For Boeing, it is no secret that our business is in a difficult
period, in part due to our own mistakes in the past,” he said. “Working
together, I know that we can get back on track, but a strike would put
our shared recovery in jeopardy, further eroding trust with our
customers and hurting our ability to determine our future together.”</p>
<p>The head of the union local, IAM District 751 President Jon Holden,
said Ortberg faced a difficult position because machinists were bitter
about stagnant wages and concessions they have made since 2008 on
pensions and health care to prevent the company from moving jobs
elsewhere.</p>
<p>“This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about
fighting for our future,” Holden said in announcing the strike.</p>
<p>The vote also was a rebuke to Holden and union negotiators, who
recommended workers approve the contract offer. Holden, who had
predicted workers would vote to strike, said the union would survey
members to decide which issues they want to stress when negotiations
resume.</p>
