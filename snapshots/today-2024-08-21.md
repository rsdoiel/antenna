## A big convention should bring big business … right?

date: 2024-08-21, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>A lot of Chicagoland restaurants were hoping for a shot in the arm courtesy of the Democratic National Convention this week. But so far, that hasn&#8217;t seemed to be the case for some businesses. We hear more. Then: a look at why Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s word choice in Jackson Hole will be so closely scrutinized. And later, older workers with disabilities have made gains thanks to remote work.</p>

## The FTC’s noncompete agreements ban has been struck down

date: 2024-08-21, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

<p>[<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225112/ftc-noncompete-agreement-ban-blocked-judge">Jess Weatherbed at The Verge</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"A federal judge has blocked the Federal Trade Commission’s ban on noncompete agreements that make it difficult for workers to join their employers’ rivals or launch competing businesses. The ruling prevents the FTC’s ban on noncompete agreements from taking effect on September 4th, though the agency could still appeal the decision."</p></blockquote><p>This is such a blow. Non-competes are already illegal in California; they're inherently anti-worker and are also very clearly a hindrance to innovation.</p><p>Hopefully the FTC appeals. The judge's argument that it would cause "irreparable harm" is nonsense: any business that has to protect itself by not allowing its workforce to go work for a competitor is obviously not competitive at what it does. Instead, businesses should seek to do good work and create conditions so that workers <em>don't want to leave in the first place</em>. The solution is a better workplace, not legal restrictions that prevent people from finding a different employer.</p>

## Using AI to feed my toddler on a road trip

date: 2024-08-21, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p><img src="https://werd.io/file/66c5ebf0694c76b14d007b42/thumb.jpg" alt="Intersecting freeways" width="1024" height="767"></p><p>This past week I embarked upon two long car drives — from Philadelphia to Cape Cod and back again — with an almost-two year-old. He’s a remarkably good traveler who takes everything in his stride (as long as he has his puffy stickers and you agree to put Elmo on the radio from time to time).</p><p>The biggest challenge was finding places for him to eat well: restaurants that wouldn’t bat an eyelid at a toddler doing toddler things at the table, that also would have the kinds of food that he likes. (Yes, I packed snacks. But sometimes it’s time to sit down for a real meal.)</p><p>We made it work, but it was always a bit of a guessing game. Would X chain or Y mom-and-pop accommodate his needs? I found myself wishing that there was some kind of app that would just recommend somewhere to go — particularly as he could get hungry at a moment’s notice, and faffing around with restaurant reviews while I was driving was an impossibility.</p><p>So out of interest, once I returned, I asked ChatGPT for recommendations:</p><blockquote><p>Find a restaurant suitable for attending with a toddler in Elkins Park, PA. Please just return the restaurant name and address; don't share any other information.</p></blockquote><p>It returns:</p><blockquote><p>The Creekside Co-op<br />7909 High School Rd, Elkins Park, PA 19027</p></blockquote><p>That’s pretty good! Creekside is a local marketplace and brewery near where I live that absolutely is suitable for hanging out with a toddler.</p><p>I tried it in a few locations. In the part of Cape Cod where we were staying, it suggested the <a href="https://moonakiscafe.com/">Moonakis Cafe</a>, which is a superb choice. In the part of Oxford, England, where I grew up, it suggested <a href="https://butcombe.com/the-victoria-arms-oxfordshire/">The Victoria Arms</a> — again, no complaints whatsoever. I’d eat there with my little one in a heartbeat.</p><p>So what if I want to make this a simple app, starting on the web?</p><p>It turns out that you can replace the name of the location in the query with its GPS coordinates, which simplifies matters a great deal. You can get <a href="https://w3c.github.io/geolocation/">the user’s current location via the web geolocation API</a>: you can then plug that straight into the query, make an API call, and forward the user directly to a Google Maps view for the restaurant. Reverse geocoding APIs, which take latitude and longitude and return a human-readable name, <a href="https://www.geoapify.com/reverse-geocoding-api/">are also available</a>, and might be useful — but they tend to cost money, and the API call to ChatGPT is already an expense.</p><p>More refinements are possible, of course. Most crucially, it would be helpful to know if a given restaurant is actually open; on a road trip, it would also be very useful to find restaurants that are close to the freeway. I wouldn’t mind seeing a top 3 or top 5 list with the relative merits of each one. And being able to plan a trip around toddler-friendly eating spots in advance would be gold.</p><p>What’s sort of neat about the technology is that this is all actually very feasible — <em>in an hour or two</em>. Using AI as an engine in this way cuts out a lot of development time, not to mention the need to gather your own database. There are obviously ethical issues related to how these models were trained, which are sure to be litigated for years to come. But here we’re not creating any new content or replacing an artist: we’re making it easier to find our way to a local business.</p><p>The next time I’m on a road trip with my little one and I see that he’s starting to get hungry, I’ll be able to hit a button on my phone and get directions to a nearby place that will probably be appropriate for him to sit down and eat at. I think that’s cool.</p></div>

## Automating ZFS snapshots for peace of mind

date: 2024-08-21, from: OS News

One feature I couldn’t live without anymore is snapshots. As system administrators, we often find ourselves in situations where we’ve made a mistake, need to revert to a previous state, or need access to a log that has been rotated and disappeared. Since I started using ZFS, all of this has become incredibly simple, and I feel much more at ease when making any modifications. However, since I don’t always remember to create a manual snapshot before starting to work, I use an automatic snapshot system. For this type of snapshot, I use the&#160;excellent&#160;zfs-autobackup&#160;tool&#160;&#8211; which I also&#160;use for backups. The goal is to have a single, flexible, and configurable tool without having to learn different syntaxes. ↫ Stefano Marinelli I&#8217;m always a little sad about the fact that the kind of advanced features modern file systems like ZFS, btrfs, and others offer are so inaccessible to mere desktop users like myself. While I understand they&#8217;re primarily designed for server use, they&#8217;re still making their way to desktops &#8211; my Fedora installations all default to btrfs &#8211; and I&#8217;d love to be able to make use of their advanced features straight from within KDE (or GNOME or whatever it is you use). Of course, that&#8217;s neither here or there for the article at hand, which will be quite useful for people administering FreeBSD and/or Linux systems, and who would like to get the most out of ZFS by automating some of its functionality.

<p>Noncompete agreements, where your employer has you sign a contract promising you won&#8217;t work for a competitor in the future, were originally used to protect intellectual property but now are so widespread that they can apply to fast food workers. The Federal Trade Commission wanted to ban noncompetes but a federal judge in Texas has blocked the ban.

## China ‘concerned’ after report alleging US nuclear strategy change

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

Seoul, South Korea — China on Wednesday said it was “seriously concerned” after a report alleged the United States recently approved a secret plan to shift some of the focus of its nuclear strategy away from Russia to deal with Beijing's nuclear weapons buildup.


In a report late Tuesday, The New York Times reported that U.S. President Joe Biden in March approved a new “nuclear employment guidance,” a highly classified document outlining how the U.S. would use nuclear weapons in a potential conflict.


The report said the document, updated every four years, reorients U.S. nuclear deterrent strategy to deal with China’s massive expansion of its nuclear arsenal. The document also orders U.S. forces to prepare for the possibility of “coordinated nuclear challenges” from China, Russia, and North Korea, according to the report.




Asked about the report during a press briefing Wednesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson accused the United States of “peddling the China nuclear threat narrative” and “finding excuses to seek strategic advantage.”


"China is seriously concerned about the relevant report, and the facts have fully proven that the United States has constantly stirred up the so-called China nuclear threat theory in recent years," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning.


Russia has not responded to the report.


For decades, U.S. nuclear policy has been primarily focused on Russia, the only other country with comparable nuclear weapons capabilities.


However, U.S. officials have increasingly warned that China’s nuclear buildup under President Xi Jinping is proceeding faster than previously expected.


In an unclassified document released late last year, the Pentagon estimated that the Chinese military had more than 500 operational warheads in its arsenal and will have more than 1,000 warheads by 2030.


That compares to the United States, which possesses a nuclear stockpile of about 3,700 active warheads, according to estimates compiled by the U.S.-based Arms Control Association.


Russia has roughly 4,380 nuclear warheads, including about 1,550 on strategic delivery systems, according to estimates cited by the group.


Given those numbers, Russia remains the “major driver” behind U.S. nuclear strategy, said Daryl G. Kimball, the director of the Arms Control Association, in a post on social media site X.


The Times report overstates the changes outlined in the U.S. nuclear weapons guidance document, according to Kimball, who insisted there has been no reorientation away from Russia toward China.


“Despite China’s nuclear expansion, Russia’s arsenal significantly exceeds that of China’s - even after Xi’s ambitious plan is complete. Until that changes, focus will remain on Russia’s arsenal,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists.


“But planning against China is increasing, as reflected in the document,” Kristensen added in a post on X.


U.S. officials have publicly referred to the nuclear weapons document at least twice, without offering much detail on its contents.


In June, Pranay Vaddi, the White House National Security Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, said the new guidance “emphasizes the need to account for the growth and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal, as well the need to deter Russia, China, and North Korea simultaneously.


According to Vaddi, the U.S. will continue to pursue nuclear arms restraints with Russia and China, but “without a change in the trajectory that Russia, [China], and North Korea are on,” the U.S. “will need to continue to adjust our posture and capabilities to ensure our ability to deter and meet other objectives going forward.”


Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear security specialist who until recently focused on nuclear policy in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden “recently issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries, and, in particular, the significant increase in the size and diversity of [China’s] nuclear arsenal.”


“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” said Narang. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter century after the Cold War as ‘nuclear intermission’.”


U.S. and Chinese officials both frequently speak of the dangers of nuclear war, but efforts to hold dialogue on the issue have failed.


Last year, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to negotiations on nuclear non-proliferation and arms control, ahead of a meeting between Biden and Xi. But China suspended the talks last month, citing U.S. arms sales to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own.


Many analysts are also concerned about growing military and diplomatic cooperation between Russia and China. In 2022, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on a “no-limits” partnership and have recently expanded joint military exercises and other cooperation.


Earlier this year, Russia also restored a Cold War-era mutual defense treaty with nuclear-armed North Korea and hinted at further defense cooperation.


Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin has repeatedly issued thinly veiled threats about using nuclear weapons against Western-backed forces there.

## This Isn’t the Same Kind of Climate Election

date: 2024-08-21, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3NjIxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NTU0NjAwMn0.ZZCen9aLdBiUl-0SsjzTUCrNtTrnuINpr02cB_Mc3UY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Democrats are gathering in Chicago this week for their quadrennial convention and to celebrate Kamala Harris’s nomination for president. This year’s convention will look different from 2020’s for many reasons — but one of them is that we’re likely to hear far less about climate change. Unlike in 2020, when President Joe Biden described global warming as one of “four overlapping crises” confronting the country, Harris has been more subtle when discussing it.
</p><p>
	So … is that a problem? Should we be freaked out? On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse discuss the modern electoral politics of climate change. We talk about whether the electorate’s interest in climate issues has faded, how the Inflation Reduction Act could affect voting, and why a “quiet on climate” strategy might be okay. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>The other thing that I think is really fascinating — and I've felt like this is a case that a political scientist could certainly have more to say about — but it feels like this is a case that the focus on climate in the 117th Congress, the Congress that passed the infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, was, I think, largely elite-driven. Like inside-the-Beltway priority-setting, not so much a general response to polling, even though you're right, there was an energy crisis that actually happened towards the tail end of that legislative debate.
	<br/>
<br/>
And the original agenda was the Build Back Better agenda from the Biden administration, which is really trying to center these investments in new economies, new industries — including clean energy — as part of a broader post-COVID economic recovery.
	<br/>
<br/>
What was fascinating to me is that, you know, the Build Back Better Act was really a cost of living-focused bill. It had a huge amount of programs focused on the cost of childcare, on elder care, on healthcare. And all of that got stripped out as the bill moved on and eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act, which primarily centered around climate and clean energy investment with a small residual piece around prescription drugs and extending Affordable Care Act subsidies for lower middle class folks that rely on the insurance exchanges. Most of the stuff that would now, I think, be hugely popular in this electoral cycle because it much more centrally spoke to the concerns about cost of living got pulled out at the behest of folks like Joe Manchin, who wanted to strip the bill down and not focus on expanding social programs.
	<br/>
<br/>
So it's kind of an interesting dynamic. If I were to look at polls and use those polls to have predicted which pieces would fall out of the bill as the Build Back Better Act moved through the hand to hand combat of congressional passage, I would have expected it would have been climate because it's always low on the priority list when you look at polling, but it was actually the exact opposite.
	<br/>
<br/>
I think there was a sense in the halls of Congress that climate was the one thing you couldn't jettison because that was their one chance to take a shot at it. And they didn't know when they would get another shot.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I want to moderate that — or I want to disagree slightly on a few things. I totally agree, first of all, that climate acted in the IRA negotiations primarily as an elite-driven issue. And I think that is often ignored in conversations about the IRA, and I think it is actually quite important to hit home that point because it should lead to better decision-making in the future — both as people who want to see the federal government continue to push on decarbonization and also people interested in political actors making smart choices and decisions around decarbonization.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that a lot of that so-called care-focused policy in the IRA, I think it fell out for two reasons. The first is that Democrats thought that they were going to be able to get a better deal from Manchin. Manchin agreed to terms in October 2021, he agreed to a set of terms that Democrats kind of then just blew past. They thought that basically by bullying him, by ignoring his demands, he was going to give way and allow a larger bill, and he ultimately did not.
	<br/>
<br/>
But No. 2, I guess I would add that the other place where the care economy stuff got really hit was that some of the policy design seemed pretty bad. There were white papers that came out or blog posts that came out during the October 2021 to March 2022 period that suggested that there were going to be real unintended consequences, especially around the childcare policy, that had not been seriously looked at. And while I don't think those blog posts or analysis played a decisive role, I do think that — I remember Matt Bruenig wrote 
	<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/democratic-childcare-proposal-hurts-families/620749/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a big piece here</u></a> — I do think that that led to Democrats being more willing to jettison the policy because they felt like that policy had emerged from kind of a morass of foundation-funded nonprofits and maybe hadn't gotten the close inspection that it needed —<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>It wasn't quite ready for …<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>It wasn't quite ready for primetime, and in a different way than the energy tax credits in the IRA were ready for primetime — because to some degree, they were a giant expansion on policy that Congress had already done for a while, right? And obviously there were new tax credits, too. But there was an existing economic record that Congress could subsidize clean via the tax code and not create massive, massive unintended, distortionary effects in the economy that did not exist for, say, childcare.

## DNC's Day 2: Double dose of Obama firepower, a doting spouse and a dance party

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — The Democratic National Convention's second night showcased a double dose of Obama firepower to validate Vice President Kamala Harris and deliver an unsparing indictment of Republican Donald Trump. The convention also served up a raucous roll call of states that was essentially one big dance party.


Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, ducked out of Chicago to hold a rally just up the interstate in Milwaukee, wooing voters in battleground Wisconsin. It was a recognition that, regardless of whatever good vibes may exist at the convention, Democrats expect this presidential election to be razor-close.


Here are some takeaways from the convention's second night.


The ex-presidents club


If the Republican convention was all about Trump, the Democrats on Tuesday wanted to put Harris in a pantheon with past presidents.


The biggest validators of the night were former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. The latter linked Harris with her husband by telling the rapt crowd, “America, hope is making a comeback.”


Barack Obama, for his part, reached back to his own 2004 convention speech to tie Harris to his legacy. “I am feeling hopeful -- because this convention has always been pretty good to kids with funny names who believe in a country where everything is possible,” he said.


It wasn’t just the Obamas making the case for the vice president. The grandsons of Jimmy Carter and John F. Kennedy also portrayed her as the natural heir of past Democratic leaders.


As groundbreaking as Harris’ candidacy is as the first woman of color to be her party’s nominee, these speeches by an ex-president and presidential progeny were all about linking her to a broader historical arc and evoking the excitement of Obama’s 2008 run that Harris hopes to replicate.


Diverting from the high road


The Obamas did not hold back in lacing into Trump. Michelle Obama's well-worn adage from years past that “when they go low, we go high” no longer seemed operative.


Barack Obama called Trump “a 78-year-old billionaire who hasn’t stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.”


Michelle Obama also took a personal swipe, saying: “For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black.”


Playing off her famous line about Republicans going low, Michelle Obama suggested that Trump was going “small” and that “it’s unhealthy, and quite frankly, it’s unpresidential.”


DNC dance party


Political conventions technically happen so that delegates can nominate presidential and vice presidential candidates.


This year, the Democrats took care of that job in advance. But that didn't stop them from holding a ceremonial do-over and turning it into a raucous dance party.


DJ Cassidy strode on stage in a bright blue double-breasted suit and spun tunes for every state as they nominated Harris and Walz. Minnesota got “1999” by native son Prince, Kansas got “Carry on Wayward Son” by, well, Kansas. “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen played as New Jersey weighed in.


Usually it was governors or state party chairs calling out the votes, but some states passed the mic to make serious points. Kate Cox, who unsuccessfully sued her home state of Texas while seeking an abortion for a non-viable fetus, announced Texas’ votes. A survivor of the 2017 Las Vegas strip gun massacre announced Nevada’s votes.


The roll call highlight was when Atlanta rapper Lil Jon strode through the United Center to the beats of “Turn Down for What,” his song with DJ Snake, and rapped his support for Harris and Walz.


Democrats are eager to highlight how Harris’ ascension has energized the party. The roll call fit that vibe.


America’s blind date with Doug Emhoff


Doug Emhoff wants America to love his wife as much as he does.


His convention speech Tuesday night focused on their love story and offered a personal glimpse meant to pull in voters, too. He dished on the deets of their first phone call, after he left her a rambling voicemail that she still makes him listen to every year on their anniversary.


“I love that laugh,” he said adoringly, a rebuttal to Trump’s criticism of Harris’ laughter.


As Harris flew back to Chicago from Milwaukee after her rally there, Air Force Two spent an extra 10 minutes in the air so she could watch her husband speak, according to an aide.


Emhoff said he “just fell in love fast” with Harris, adding that she finds “joy in pursuing justice” and “stands up to bullies.” It’s not how most husbands describe their partners, but, then, Emhoff is trying to convince voters that the woman he’s been married to for 10 years this Thursday knows how to take on Trump.


A message for Republicans: It’s OK to quit Trump


The Democrats are making a play for disaffected Trump voters — and they used one of his former White House staffers to make their case.


Stephanie Grisham worked in various roles in the Trump White House, including communications director and press secretary, allowing Democrats to argue that those who know Trump best have seen him at his worst.


“He has no empathy, no morals, and no fidelity to the truth,” Grisham said. “I couldn’t be part of the insanity any longer."


Kyle Sweetser, a Trump voter from Alabama, told the convention the former president’s tariffs made life harder for construction workers like him. Republican Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, also spoke about why he’s backing Harris. Giles sees Trump’s policies as hurting cities like his.

## Obamas close DNC's second night with rousing Harris endorsement

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — Warning of a difficult fight ahead, former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama on Tuesday called on the nation to embrace Kamala Harris in urgent messages to the Democratic National Convention that were at times both hopeful and foreboding.


"America, hope is making a comeback," the former first lady declared. She then tore into Republican Donald Trump, a sharp shift from the 2016 convention speech in which she told her party, "When they go low, we go high."


"His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black," Obama said of Trump.


Her husband, the nation's first Black president pushing for America to elect its second, called Trump "a 78-year-old billionaire who hasn't stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago."




"It's been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that's actually gotten worse now that he's afraid of losing to Kamala," he charged.


The fiery messages from two of the Democratic Party's biggest stars underscored the urgency of the moment as Harris works to stitch together a broad coalition in her bid to defeat Trump this fall. She is drawing on stars like the Obamas and other celebrities, officials from the far left to the middle, and even some Republicans to boost her campaign.


And while the theme of the night was "a bold vision for America's future," the disparate factions of Harris' evolving coalition demonstrated, above all, that they are connected by a deep desire to prevent a second Trump presidency.


Just ahead of the Obamas' remarks, Harris addressed an estimated 15,000 people in battleground Wisconsin in the arena where Republicans held their convention last month. She declared that she was running "a people-powered campaign."


"Together we will chart a new way forward," the vice president said in remarks that were partially broadcast to the DNC. "A future for freedom, opportunity, of optimism and faith."


Back in Chicago, Senators Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent beloved by progressives, both praised Harris. And in an appearance perhaps intended to needle Trump, his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham — now a harsh critic of her former boss — also took the convention stage.


Trump "has no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth," Grisham said. "I love my country more than my party. Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people. And she has my vote."


Still, it was not all serious on the second night of the four-day convention.


A symbolic roll call in which delegates from each state pledged their support for the Democratic nominee turned into a party atmosphere. A DJ played a mix of state-specific songs — and Atlanta native Lil Jon ran out during Georgia's turn to his hit song with DJ Snake, "Turn Down for What," to the delight of the thousands inside the cavernous United Center.


Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who will become the nation's first gentleman if his wife wins the presidency, shared personal details about his relationship with Harris — their cooking habits, their first date and her laugh, which is often mocked by Republican critics.


"You know that laugh. I love that laugh!" Emhoff said as the crowd cheered. Later, he added, "Her empathy is her strength."


Trump, meanwhile, was out on the campaign trail as part of his weeklong swing-state tour during the Democratic convention. He went to Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday and stood aside sheriff's deputies as he labeled Harris the "ringleader" of a "Marxist attack on law enforcement" across the country.


"Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death," Trump said in one of many generalizations about an America under Harris.


Harris, meanwhile, cast the election in dire, almost existential terms. She implored Americans not to get complacent in light of the Supreme Court decision carving out broad presidential immunity, a power she said Trump would abuse.


She has also seized on Trump's opposition to a nationally guaranteed right to abortion.


"They seemingly don't trust women," she said of Trump and his Republican allies. "Well, we trust women."


The vice president's speech evoked some of the same themes that underlaid Biden's case for reelection before he dropped out, casting Trump as a threat to democracy. Harris argued that Trump threatens the values and freedoms that Americans hold dear.


Someone with that record "should never again have the opportunity to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States," Harris said. "Never again."

## Protesters arrested after clash with police outside Chicago's Israeli consulate

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters charged a line of police in an intense standoff with hundreds of officers outside the Israeli consulate Tuesday on the second night of the Democratic National Convention.


After the larger gathering began to disperse, splintering off into smaller groups, other interactions with police led to more than a dozen arrests. Officers called the demonstrations "an unlawful assembly."


Earlier in the night, officers carrying wooden clubs shouted "move" and penned the demonstrators in on the street, preventing them from marching.


Some demonstrators set an American flag on fire in the street as the celebratory roll call for Vice President Kamala Harris took place inside the United Center about 3.2 kilometers away. Others carried Palestinian flags, while many others wore black and covered their faces.


As protesters regrouped and approached a line of police in riot gear in front of a Chicago skyscraper that houses the Israeli consulate, an officer said into a megaphone, "You are ordered to immediately disburse." A woman in the front of the march shouted back with her own megaphone: "We're not scared of you."


A man in a Chicago Bulls hat, his face covered by a balaclava, called on protesters to "shut down the DNC." The group, which is not affiliated with the coalition of over 200 groups that organized Monday's protests, advertised the demonstration Tuesday under the slogan of "Make it great like '68," invoking the anti-Vietnam War protests that seized the city during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.


The atmosphere with rows of police in riot gear was a stark contrast to a day earlier when thousands of pro-Palestinian activists, including families pushing babies in strollers, marched near the convention site calling for a cease-fire.


Police kept protesters confined to a block of Madison Street, a normally bustling downtown thoroughfare where traffic was halted on both ends Tuesday evening.




Law enforcement had closed down most of the entrances to the building on Tuesday, allowing commuters to come in only one entrance where armed officers were also posted. Many of the building's shops were closed. Martha Hill, a spokeswoman for the Metra commuter rail service, said train service was running as normal.


The consulate has been the site of numerous demonstrations since the war in Gaza began in October. It is in a building connected to the Ogilvie Transportation Center, a major commuter rail station.


Mohammed Ismail, a 29-year-old psychiatry resident who lives in Chicago, described the police presence as "excessive," and questioned why the group had been blocked from marching. He said he joined the protest to urge Democrats to cease funding to Israel.


"It's not right that we're sending our tax money to fund an ongoing slaughter, an ongoing genocide," Ismail said. "We're a part of this conflict because our money is paying for it."


Meanwhile, the sites of demonstrations from the previous night were largely quiet. Thirteen people were arrested during Monday's protests, most them related to a "brief breach" of security fencing "within sight and sound of the United Center," the city's police superintendent said.


Israel supporters, including some relatives of people kidnapped by Hamas, gathered earlier in the day at a pro-Israel art installation not far from the consulate to call on U.S. leaders to continue backing Israel and pushing for the release of hostages. The art installation included giant milk cartons bearing photos of some of the hostages.




Elan Carr, CEO of the Israeli-American Council, condemned the pro-Palestinian protesters who have descended on Chicago this week, calling them "fringe crazies" and demanding that U.S. leaders "stand unequivocally with the state of Israel."


More protests were planned throughout the week. However, attendance at the main rally on Monday was far below estimates of organizers who had predicted more than 20,000 would show up.


Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said Tuesday that the crowd was around 3,500 strong and that the vast majority of the protesters were peaceful.


However, some clashed with police, used pepper spray against them and threw water bottles at officers during the clash in the park where there was a breach in security fencing, Snelling said. He said officers did not use any chemical sprays.


"Our officers showed great restraint," he said at a news conference. "We're not going to tolerate vandalism and violence in our city. ... We're going to continue to protect the city."


Snelling said with more protests planned, his department is prepared to de-escalate situations whenever possible.


"Again, we're up to the challenge," Snelling said. "The city is up to the challenge."


The park where the most arrests were made, located a block from the convention arena, served as a destination point for a march of thousands calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Several dozen activists broke off from the main group, breached the fencing, and were pushed back by police.


Authorities said the inner security perimeter surrounding the United Center was not breached and there was no threat to those attending the convention.


On Tuesday morning, an extra line of fencing was installed at the park and the tall metal barriers were reinforced to prevent protesters from lifting and removing the panels. No police officers or protesters were in the park early Tuesday.




The 13 people arrested during Monday's protest were detained on charges ranging from criminal trespass and resisting and obstructing an arrest, to aggravated battery of police officers, Snelling said.


At least 10 of them were arrested in connection with the fence, he said.


Snelling said he did not connect those who tore down the fence with the entirety of the march. He said the vast majority of participants were peaceful, and he praised his officers' conduct in the moment.


The Chicago chapter of the National Lawyers Guild said two of the people arrested were hospitalized. Snelling said they were not taken to the hospital for injuries, but "so they could be provided the treatment they needed when it came to their medications."


Two people were also arrested on misdemeanor property damage and resisting arrest charges during a protest march Sunday night. As of Tuesday morning, 15 people had been arrested.


Most of the largest demonstrations have been organized by the Coalition to March on the DNC, which has focused on calling for a cease-fire in Gaza. But smaller protests have popped up around the city, during the convention's welcome party at Navy Pier.

## Political criticism and controversy swirls ahead of China video game release

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

washington —  The release of a Chinese video game touted as the country’s first to meet Triple-A standards, has sparked a flurry of online criticism of the Chinese government.


Video games are given a AAA label when they are backed by big funds, highly developed and distributed by well-known publishers.


The Aug. 20 worldwide release of the Chinese game Black Myth: Wukong has been anticipated since its demo got more than 56 million views on the Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili in 2020.


On YouTube, which is banned in China, the game demo had more than 10 million views.


Developed by China-based Game Science, the game has players take on the role of the Monkey King, a character from the Chinese classic novel Journey to the West, and defeat monsters wreaking havoc on the world.


Although the game has no direct connection to politics, Chinese commenters took to a U.S.–based gaming discussion board ahead of the release to criticize the Chinese government and President Xi Jinping.  


The discussion board on Steam, a Washington state-based online gaming platform, was hit with a slew of comments in Chinese last week that directly and indirectly criticized Chinese authorities and Xi.  


One mocked Xi’s unprecedented third term as leader, saying, "I will continue to be Jade Emperor in Black Myth: Wukong. Raise your hands if you oppose it."


Most critical posts ranted against the Chinese government, in ways unrelated to the game.


"Overthrow the Communist Party of China and establish a democratic constitutional system where everyone has a vote," read what appeared to be the first critical comment.  


"Thank you to the party, thank you to our great chief accelerator, Xi Jinping," another comment reads, mocking Xi’s policies as accelerating China's economic decline.


Another post listed the timeline of the weeks-long 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests and the subsequent violent crackdown that occurred when Chinese troops used lethal force against student-led demonstrators, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands.


Such critical comments of China’s government and leaders are not allowed on China’s internet, where an army of censors frequently scrubs websites and discussion boards of comments that do not follow the Chinese Communist Party’s line.  


Observers were surprised to find by the afternoon of Aug. 16, many of the critical posts on Steam’s U.S. discussion board had similarly been removed.  


Li Ying, a Chinese social media influencer and government critic known online as Teacher Li, posted his opposition to the removal on Aug. 14 on X with screenshots of the original posts.


"Steam is inherently a free platform, with a wide variety of games here, and players are free to express any opinions and opinions about the game," he wrote on X.


Steam's China-based website does not have a discussion board, and the U.S.-based discussion board is only available to users outside China. Those inside China need to use a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which helps users bypass controls to access internet content outside the country that is blocked.


VOA reached out to Steam seeking comment about why the posts were deleted but did not receive a reply. Steam's discussion board rules do not explicitly prohibit political posts but say that users are not allowed to post “disrespectful” content and to avoid posting content unrelated to the topic.


While the game is not directly connected to the Chinese government, it did receive some official help and praise. The city government of Hangzhou, where Game Science is located, gave the game a grant in 2022. State media in the province, Zhejiang, described the game as "one of the most important explorers in the history of AAA games in China – an explorer that deserves applause and encouragement."


It’s not the first time Black Myth: Wukong has stirred up some controversy.


The game's developers have been accused of making lewd and sexist remarks.


Feng Ji, the founder and CEO of Game Science, in a Weibo post last year lamenting the difficulties in development, used words with erotic connotations and compared his desire for expanding development to oral sex.


Yang Qi, the game's artistic director, remarked as early as 2013 on Weibo that they would not pander to female players in the game's production.


"I don't need the reverse drive of female players. I don't take care of those lewd insects who come to pick up girls; some things are made for pure men," he wrote.


In response, a female influencer posted on the gender-focused WeChat account Orange Umbrella, urging Game Science to respect female gamers.


"As a fellow player, I know how much hard work and dedication it takes to make a game, and Black Myth: Wukong's dedication and seriousness in the production are commendable," she wrote. "However, don't let the backward gender consciousness push players who are also full of expectations for the game in the opposite direction more and more."


When Western media, including IGN, one of the most influential U.S. online news sites for video games, reported last year on the controversial comments, nationalist Chinese commenters called the coverage an attempt to impose western values and put down China’s gaming industry.


"Judging the Chinese game with the politically correct stance of the West is really biased for the media," a review article reads. The article said whether the developers' remarks constituted sexism "depends on the perspective."


On Weibo, one commenter called IGN a "clown" and wrote, "In order to suppress the rise of Chinese games, the gender card is unsurprisingly played again."


Despite the controversies, gaming industry experts expect Black Myth: Wukong to be a big hit.


Daniel Camilo, a game industry consultant based in southern China’s Shenzhen city, noted to VOA that sexism in the gaming industry is not new and has little impact on commercial success.


"Hardcore gamers and fans that actively discuss these issues and are aware of them usually represent a very small [loud] minority online that accounts for a small residual amount of those who actually buy games," he said.


The game has already received high praise from reviewers in China and abroad.


IGN gave the game an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 on Aug. 16, calling it a "great action game with great fights and exciting and powerful opponents, albeit with a few bugs."


The Chinese version of IGN gave the game a perfect score of 10, writing, "This is a truly competitive domestic game in the global market, and I believe it will be a strong contender for this year's Game of the Year."


Camilo noted the high quality of the homegrown game has given Chinese players something to be proud of that might even help improve China's international image.


"Black Myth will change perceptions people have regarding Chinese games and, to some extent, China and its cultural output and soft power really," he said.

## AI in Journalism Futures 2024

<p>[<a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/publications/ai-in-journalism-futures-2024">Open Society Foundations</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"In February 2024, the Open Society Foundations issued a call for applications for a convening in which selected participants would share their visions of an AI-mediated future."</p></blockquote><p>I thought this, from the concluding observations, was telling:</p><blockquote><p>"Participants were generally
reluctant or unable to articulate exactly how AI might transform the information ecosystem.

## US says classified nuclear strategy not response to single country, threat

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A classified nuclear strategic plan approved by President Joe Biden this year is not a response to a single country or threat, the White House said on Tuesday, after the New York Times reported it reoriented the U.S. deterrence strategy to focus on China's expansion of its nuclear arsenal for the first time.


The U.S.-based Arms Control Association said it understood U.S. nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration's 2022 Nuclear Posture Review, and there had been no reorientation away from Russia and toward China.


The New York Times said the White House never announced that Biden approved the revised strategy, titled the "Nuclear Employment Guidance," but an unclassified notification to Congress of the revision is expected to be sent before Biden leaves office.


The newspaper said that in recent speeches, two senior administration officials were allowed to allude to the strategy revision. It said the strategy is updated every four years or so.


Asked about the report, White House spokesperson Sean Savett said: "This administration, like the four administrations before it, issued a Nuclear Posture Review and Nuclear Weapons Employment Planning Guidance.


"While the specific text of the Guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. The Guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat."


Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while U.S. intelligence estimates suggest China may increase the size its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia has about 4,000 nuclear warheads "and it remains the major driver behind U.S. nuclear strategy."


Kimball cited June remarks by one of the officials referred to in the Times report, White House Senior Director for Arms Control, Disarmament, and Nonproliferation Pranay Vaddi.


According to those remarks, U.S. strategy was to pursue nuclear arms restraints with China and Russia, but if China continued on its current trajectory and if Russia exceeds New START limits, the U.S. at some point in the future may need to consider adjustments to the size and makeup of its nuclear force, Kimball said.


"My understanding is that the point at which the current administration thinks it might want to consider such changes won't come until 2030, or some time after," he said.

## Trump campaigns in Michigan with 'Make America Safe Again' speech

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

HOWELL, Michigan — Former President Donald Trump pledged Tuesday to "Make America Safe Again" while campaigning in Michigan as Democrats gathered in Chicago to nominate Kamala Harris. 


As part of a battleground campaign swing designed to counter the Democratic National Convention, Trump stood alongside sheriff's deputies in the city of Howell and tarred Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, as the "ringleader" of a "Marxist attack on law enforcement" across the country. 


"Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death," Trump said in one of many generalizations about an America under Harris. "You'll see levels of crime that you've never seen before. ... I will deliver law, order, safety and peace." 


Trump has sought in recent weeks to blunt the enthusiasm that Harris has attracted since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed her. That has involved both dark predictions about what electing Harris would mean for the country and efforts by Trump's advisers to set up events where he can try to draw specific policy contrasts. On Tuesday in Michigan, the subject was crime and public safety. 


In excerpts released before his speech, Trump's campaign also said he would call for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers; he did not mention that during his remarks. 


The event was the latest billed as focused on a specific issue. But on these occasions, Trump has spent considerable time attacking Harris personally and taking shots at Biden, and the same was true after their appearances Monday at the Democratic convention. 


"I watched last night in amazement as they tried to pretend everything was great," Trump said, singling out inflation and the U.S.-Mexico border as topics Democrats glossed over. "We have a fool as president," he said of Biden. 


Trump presented a bleak portrait of life in the U.S. and the threat of a Harris presidency, though he was short on specifics and heavy on hyperbole. 


"It's just insane," Trump said. "You can't walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be. And you've seen it, and I've seen it, and it's time for a change." 


Trump making such claims, surrounded by supportive law enforcement officers, stood in stark contrast to the Democrats' convention. Speaker after speaker found ways Monday night in Chicago to remind Americans that Trump is the first former president ever convicted of felony crimes, has been found civilly liable for sexual assault, and still faces multiple indictments, including for his efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat to Biden. 


Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas skewered Trump on Monday night as "a career criminal, with 34 felonies, two impeachments and one porn star," a reference to his payments to an adult film actress at issue in his New York conviction for business fraud. 


The derision reached its peak as Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in 2016, stood back from the podium and smiled as delegates chanted: "Lock him up! Lock him up!" — a turnabout from Trump supporters' chants about Clinton eight years ago despite the former secretary of state never having been charged with any crime.

## FreeBSD and AMD collaborating on FreeBSD IOMMU driver

date: 2024-08-20, from: OS News

The FreeBSD project has published its latest quarterly status report, and there&#8217;s a lot in there. The most prominent effort listed in the report is a close collaboration between FreeBSD and AMD on an IOMMU driver for AMD&#8217;s server processors. Work continued on a joint project between Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and The FreeBSD Foundation to develop a complete FreeBSD AMD IOMMU driver. This work will allow FreeBSD to fully support greater than 256 cores with features such as CPU mapping and will also include bhyve integration. Konstantin Belousov has been working on various parts of the project, including driver attachment, register definitions, an ACPI table parser, and utility functions. Two key components that need to be completed are context handling, which is mostly a generalization of Intel DMAR code, and page table creation. After this, the AMD driver’s enable bit can be turned on for testing. ↫ FreeBSD status report page It&#8217;s great to see AMD and FreeBSD working together like this, and it highlights that FreeBSD is a serious player in the server space. Other things mentioned in the status report are continued work in improving the audio experience, wireless networking, RISC-V support, OpenZFS, and more. Through the work of Tom Jones, FreeBSD is also getting the Vector Packet Processor, a userspace networking stack that delivers fast packet processing suitable for software-defined networking and network function virtualization applications. Of course, this is just a selection, and there&#8217;s way more listed in the report. I would also like to highlight the ongoing, neverending work of improving the experience of using KDE on FreeBSD. The FreeBSD KDE team notes that due to the massive release of KDE 6, and the associated flurry of follow-up releases, requiring a lot of work and testing, KDE on FreeBSD still hasn&#8217;t fully caught up with the latest releases. KDE Frameworks is currently at 6.3.0 (6.5.0 is current), KDE Plasma Desktop is currently 6.0.3 (6.1.4 is current), and KDE Gear 6 hasn&#8217;t been ported at all yet. In other words, while progress is being made, it&#8217;s clear the team could use a hand, too.

## It’s Getting Harder to Close a Coal Plant

date: 2024-08-20, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzQxNTk3NS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NjQzNDQ3NH0.rp6_2o1DKwlosb7y-GTuUmqqhSXSsZS2CKPkri192NU/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps"><del></del>To fully decarbonize the electricity system will require more than just the rapid deployment of non-carbon-emitting generation capacity, plus the transmission necessary to get that electricity to where it needs to go. It will also require that our existing stock of electricity generation — which is largely natural gas- and coal-powered — get mostly mothballed. So far, this process has been proceeding briskly. Renewable deployment is on the way up and is projected to accelerate, and older electricity generation was sliding quickly but gracefully into retirement — until recently.</p><p>Retirements of existing generation have slowed down dramatically in the first half of this year, which is on pace to be the slowest for existing generation retirements since 2011, according to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62864" target="_blank"><u>new data from the Energy Information Administration</u></a>.</p><p>In the first half of the year, some 5.1 gigawatts of generating capacity have been retired, and another 2.4 gigawatts are scheduled to be retired by year’s end, for a projected total of 7.5 retired gigawatts. From 2004 to 2023, by contrast, just over 12 gigawatts of capacity were retired each year on average, with almost 15 gigawatts retired per year this decade. Since 2022, according to EIA data, over 90% of retired capacity has been coal or natural gas.</p><p>What’s behind the slowdown? “Reliability is threatened because the grid conditions are tightening,” Douglas Giuffre, executive director of gas, power and renewables analysis at S&P Global Commodity Insights, explained in an email. “This is partly due to the recent pace of coal and natural gas retirements in the U.S., which worked off some of the excess capacity in power markets. Now we are seeing tighter reserve margins, and a relatively thin pipeline of new gas-fired projects that can come online quickly.” That’s especially concerning for utilities at a time when projected electricity demand is <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_blank">way</a>, <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-10-ai-data-centers" target="_blank">way</a> up. </p><p>The wave of retirements was a national phenomenon, often having nothing to do with state-level plans to decarbonize. Coal and gas were being retired so steadily over the past 20 years not just because plants were aging, but also because power use was essentially flat from the early 2000s through, essentially, yesterday. This meant that older plants — especially dirty coal plants — became uneconomic to run, especially as natural gas prices began to fall. <br/></p><p>Now, we are in a completely different world. Electricity use is forecast to start growing again, thanks to a buildout of new data centers and manufacturing, plus the ongoing electrification of automobiles and home heating and cooling.</p><p>The Southeast offers an example of how these trends have played out on the ground. In December 2020, the Mississippi Public Service Commission <a href="https://www.psc.state.ms.us/InSiteConnect/InSiteView.aspx?model=INSITE_CONNECT&queue=CTS_ARCHIVEQ&docid=655509" target="_blank">determined</a> that the state had “excess reserves … largely due to decreases in projected load” and ordered a 950 megawatt reduction in generating capacity by Mississippi Power by 2027. A consulting firm hired by the commission determined that Plant Daniel, a coal plant, was “relatively inefficient compared to other available resources;” a few months later, the utility said it would <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/mississippi-power-plans-to-shutter-coal-gas-plants/" target="_blank"><u>decommission Plant Daniel by 2027</u></a>.</p><p>Then Georgia Power, the utility that covers most of the state (and, like Mississippi Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company), rushed out a new three-year plan for its future power usage less than a year after finalizing its old one. Its demand forecast through the end of the decade had jumped from 400 megawatts to 6,600 megawatts, the result of a projected <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/utilities/more-demand-more-gas-inside-the-southeasts-dirty-power-push" target="_blank">boom in data center construction</a>. <span></span></p><p>“They came in with a preselected list of ways it wanted to meet that power need,” including buying power from Plant Daniel and new gas, Bob Sherrier, a staff attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, told me. Georgia Power told the state’s utility commission that to respond to growing demand it would need to extend contracts with its sister utility in Mississippi — which meant not only that Daniel would remain open for at least another year — and build new new plants that could run on gas or diesel, plans for which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-power-plant-gas-diesel-fossil-fuel-56338ddc5e80f327efbd35c5fa9c3575" target="_blank"><u>regulators approved on Tuesday</u></a>. The utility also hinted that its existing plans to <a href="https://www.georgiapower.com/content/dam/georgia-power/pdfs/company-pdfs/2023-irp-update-main-document.pdf" target="_blank"><u>euthanize</u></a>, for the most part, its coal-fired generation fleet by the end of 2028 were likely to be revised.</p><p>“To meet that projected need, the utilities are reverting to what they know, which is fossil fuels,” Sherrier said.</p><p>In vertically integrated markets, where utilities own generating assets and sell power to customers, environmentalists have seen delayed retirements and the building of new fossil plants as examples of utilities slipping into their comfort zone, building and operating expensive projects instead of developing or procuring renewables to handle rising demand.</p><p>But it's not just in vertically integrated markets where fossil retirements are being delayed. In Maryland, for instance, Brandon Shores, a coal-fired power plant that was scheduled to close in 2025, is <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/talen-brandon-shores-wagner-battery-storage-sierra-club-pjm/715221/" target="_blank"><u>staying open</u></a> because PJM Interconnection, the regional electricity market, determined that a plan to replace it with battery storage was not a “realistic option at present” nor “technically viable to resolve the reliability violations or avoid the need for an RMR agreement at this time,” PJM president Manu Asthana said in a letter to Paul Pinsky, the director of the Maryland Energy Administration. The transmission investments required to make up the difference, meanwhile, would take several years.</p><p>Along with the neighboring Wagner plant, which burns a mix of coal, oil, and natural gas, Brandon Shores will likely stay open more than three years past its planned retirement date thanks to what’s known as a “reliability must run” contract, which “would put Maryland ratepayers on the hook for over $600 million dollars in out-of-market payments,” according to a <a href="https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_pjm_on_brandon_shores__generator_retirement.pdf" target="_blank"><u>letter</u></a> written by several Maryland congressional representatives to PJM. </p><p>Environmental advocates have blamed PJM for not doing enough proactive transmission planning to account for <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fossil-fuels/zombie-coal-plants-could-threaten-the-us-energy-transition" target="_blank"><u>predictable and scheduled plant retirements</u></a>. </p><p>The slowing retirements mean that emissions from the electricity sector, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=Electric%20Power%20Sector%20Emissions&text=Total%20Emissions%20in%202022%20%3D%206%2C343,consume%20large%20amounts%20of%20electricity." target="_blank">which have been falling since the mid-2000s</a> (with occasional bumps up as the economy has recovered from downturns), are expected to plateau over the next year or so. EIA forecasts show carbon dioxide emissions from electricity as essentially flat from 2023 to 2025, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf" target="_blank">with increased natural gas emissions</a> essentially offsetting falling coal emissions.</p><p>There is a bright side to the data, however. So far this year, the U.S. has installed just over 20 gigawatts of new generation, 80% of which has been solar and battery storage, including a 600-plus megawatt projects in Nevada and Texas. If added generation comes on in the second half of this year as planned, the EIA projects we’ll have 15 gigawatts of battery storage by year’s end. Along with the large and growing solar generation in states like California, Nevada, and Texas, the U.S. is getting closer to a grid that <em>can</em>, at least, run without carbon emissions day or night. <span></span></p>

## On the value of context

date: 2024-08-20, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I was reading a discussion about a new text editor and, as is often the case online, a bunch of people started discussing the adjacent topic of coding more broadly. The discussion started because someone was pointing out—correctly—that “typing speed” is irrelevant when it comes to programming because the art of programming is mostly about the thinking behind the code and so the majority of the time is not spent typing code.</p>
<p>People started going back and forth and it was fascinating to observe because everyone was talking about “programming” and sharing their own experience to either prove or disprove this theory that 90% of the job is not typing code but no one was providing context to help others understand what “programming” meant in their specific case. Everyone was using the word but it was clear that it meant very different things for the people involved because they’re likely to work in very different situations, doing a very different job. So yes, they were all technically “programming” but the word was meaningless without the appropriate context.</p>
<p>Reading that made me wonder how often this must happen, both online and in meatspace, people talking about something and assuming the words they use must have the same meaning for everyone while in fact that’s far from the truth.</p>
<p>Context matters. Providing details is important. Especially if you care about helping people understand what you mean when you say something.</p>                <hr>

## Elon Musk’s Twitter Takeover Is Now the Worst Buyout for Banks Since the Financial Crisis

date: 2024-08-20, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

<p>[<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musks-twitter-takeover-is-now-the-worst-buyout-for-banks-since-the-financial-crisis-3f4272cb">Alexander Saeedy and Dana Mattioli at The Wall Street Journal</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"The $13 billion that Elon Musk borrowed to buy Twitter has turned into the worst merger-finance deal for banks since the 2008-09 financial crisis."</p><p>"[...] The banks haven’t been able to offload the debt without incurring major losses—largely because of X’s weak financial performance—leaving the loans stuck on their balance sheets, or “hung” in industry jargon. The resulting write-downs have hobbled the banks’ loan books and, in one case, was a factor that crimped compensation for a bank’s merger department, according to people involved with the deal."</p></blockquote><p>Let that sink in.</p><p>It's not like this was unpredictable: it was obvious that Elon Musk was not going to turn Twitter into a roaring success. While Twitter was, at its heart, a media company, Musk's direction has been a muddle of three sometimes-competing priorities: his long-held desire to create X, an "everything" app; his desire to build his own brand in an effort to boost his own equity and therefore wealth, sometimes in ways that <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2018-219">got him in trouble with the SEC</a>; and his desire to influence global politics.</p><p>There's no three-dimensional chess being played here; this likely isn't an intentional plan by Musk to write off the debt. It's simply narcissistic mismanagement, and one has to wonder how this will affect his businesses at Tesla and SpaceX in the longer term. There will come a time when shareholders declare that enough is enough - although given that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-pay-package-vote-cbs-news-explains/">they approved his ludicrous pay deal</a>, perhaps that time isn't coming soon.</p>

## US sanctions former Haitian president over drug trafficking

date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on Haiti's former president, Michel Joseph Martelly, over drug trafficking, accusing him of playing a significant role in perpetuating the ongoing crisis in the country.


The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said Martelly "abused his influence to facilitate the trafficking of dangerous drugs, including cocaine, destined for the United States."


The department said he also worked with Haitian drug traffickers, sponsored multiple gangs and engaged in the laundering of illicit drug proceeds.


“Today’s action against Martelly emphasizes the significant and destabilizing role he and other corrupt political elites have played in perpetuating the ongoing crisis in Haiti,” Treasury's Acting Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley Smith said in the statement.


“The United States, along with our international partners, is committed to disrupting those who facilitate the drug trafficking, corruption and other illicit activities fueling the horrific gang violence and political instability.”


Tuesday's action freezes any of Martelly's U.S. assets and generally bars Americans from dealing with him.


Gang wars have displaced more than 578,000 Haitians, while nearly 5 million — almost half the population of 11.7 million — face acute hunger, with 1.6 million of those people at risk of starvation, the United Nations says.


Armed gangs have formed a broad alliance while carrying out widespread killings, ransom kidnappings and sexual violence.

## The Daily Kitten

date: 2024-08-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I do a daily episode of the adventures of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Wordle+Kitty">Wordle Kitty</a> as art I do with ChatGPT, on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2314356502105075&set=a.113966572144090&notif_id=1724164406352558&notif_t=feedback_reaction_generic&ref=notif">Facebook</a>. There often is a NY Times headline in the image, saying something silly like how prisons are dealing with an influx of convicted house pets (like the kitten). </p>
<p>In this <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/08/20/kittyInPrison.png">drawing</a> the NYT is reporting on how the kitten loves lasagna, and of course how cute she is (it's important to emphasize that in the AI prompt because otherwise you get less cute kittens in the drawing). </p>
<p>This is therapeutic. Finally I can see the NYT doing something useful! Keeping me entertained while we try to get through this election. If I'm forced to accept lies from the NYT, without any voice given to opposition, they might as well be lies that entertain me! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

## Ignore the NY Times

date: 2024-08-20, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>When President Biden took the stage last night at the DNC, I had a moment of buyer's remorse. He looked so good in his black suit, and the pictures of the new candidates, and their spouses, looked comical in comparison to the <i>president</i> who was about to speak. </p>
<p>Why did Walz have a permanent frown on his face. I find his presence next to Harris is almost always awkward. He's taller, and moves a lot. I noticed this with Sanders when he was debating Clinton in 2016. She stood still and Sanders waved his hands a lot. She spoke quietly, he shouted. </p>
<p>Biden shouted last night, and he was mostly unplugged. On the team, but you have to wonder, how did the journos get so much power that they could force this change. He gave a fine speech. I'm not sure that pushing him aside, net-net, was a win for us. Maybe Harris will be a sugar high.</p>
<p>One thing I know for sure, the new Democratic Party must not make the mistake that Biden did, must not subjugate itself to the press. When they go on the attack, you must respond. Break their wall of objectivity, these people are political players, and so far not subject to rebuttal. That must end. If they want to be in the middle, then don't pretend they aren't. </p>
<p>They will yell about the First Amendment, which also applies to elected leaders and candidates for office, and there is no special right for publications like the NYT, they have no immunity to First Amendment speech about them. </p>
<p>To the extent we can, it's time to push them aside. </p>
<p>When someone quotes the NYT in frustration, I have a mantra I repeat over and over, "Ignore the NY Times." I'm going to paste it in 25 times now so you get the idea. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. Ignore the NY Times. </p>

## Google to websites: let us train our AI on your content, or we’ll remove you from Google Search

date: 2024-08-20, from: OS News

Google now displays convenient artificial intelligence-based answers at the top of its search pages —&#160;meaning users may never click through to the websites whose data is being used to power those results. But many site owners say they can’t afford to block Google’s AI from summarizing their content. That’s because the Google tool that sifts through web content to come up with its AI answers is the same one that keeps track of web pages for search results, according to publishers. Blocking Alphabet Inc.’s Google the way sites have blocked some of its AI competitors would also hamper a site’s ability to be discovered online. ↫ Julia Love and Davey Alba OSNews still relies partially on advertising right now, and thus Google continues to play a role in our survival. You can help by reducing our dependency on Google by supporting us through Patreon, making donations using Ko-Fi, or buying our merch. The more of you support us, the closer to reality the dream of an ad-free OSNews not dependent on Google becomes. OSNews is my sole source of income, and if that does not work out, OSNews will cease to exist if I&#8217;m forced to find another job. Due to Google&#8217;s utter dominance on the internet, websites and publishers have no choice but to accept whatever Google decides to do. Not being indexed by the most popular search engine on the web with like 90% market share is a death sentence, but feeding Google&#8217;s machine learning algorithms will be a slow death by a thousands cuts, too, for many publishers. The more content is fed to Google&#8217;s AI tools, the better they&#8217;ll get at simply copying your style to a T, and the better they&#8217;ll get at showing just the little paragraph or line that matters as a Google result, meaning you won&#8217;t have to visit the site in question. It&#8217;s also not great for Google in the long-term, either. Google Search relies on humans making content for people to find; if there&#8217;s no more quality content for people to find, people aren&#8217;t going to be using Google as much anymore. In what is typical of the search giant, it seems they&#8217;re not really looking ahead very far into the future, chasing short-term profits riding the AI hype train, while long-term profits take a back seat. Maybe I&#8217;m just too stupid to understand the Silicon Valley galaxy brain business boys, but to a simple man like me it seems rather stupid to starve the very websites, publishers, authors, and so on that your main product relies on to be useful in the first place. I honestly don&#8217;t even know how much of OSNews&#8217; traffic comes from Google, so I don&#8217;t know how much it would even affect us were we to tell Google&#8217;s crawlers to get bent. My guess is that search traffic is still a sizable portion of our traffic, so I&#8217;m definitely not going to gamble the future of OSNews. Luckily we&#8217;re quite small and I doubt many people are interested in AI generating my writing style and the topics I cover anyway, so I don&#8217;t think I have to worry as much as some of the larger tech websites do.

Trump attacks Harris on energy and environment</h3><p>While the Democratic National Convention got underway in Chicago yesterday, GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance went on the offensive in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. In separate speeches, Trump and Vance slammed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ energy and environmental policies. Trump <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/trump-reiterate-he-will-stop-us-steel-sale-nippon-2024-08-19/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8qFlBsU6v0UmHJGnpdXzIRgptzViwLtA7l2gQVmAOSdz-EtnQ4ssVXE0sbCiXgq8YJhWmm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused</a> her of waging “war on American energy” and promised to “unlock American energy” if he is elected to the White House again in November. He reiterated his pledge to scrap the Biden administration’s rules limiting power plant pollution, saying Harris is on “a regulatory jihad to shut down power plants all across America.” He also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-would-consider-ending-7500-electric-vehicle-credit-2024-08-19/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8qFlBsU6v0UmHJGnpdXzIRgptzViwLtA7l2gQVmAOSdz-EtnQ4ssVXE0sbCiXgq8YJhWmm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hinted</a> at giving Tesla CEO a cabinet position. Vance told a crowd: “We are going to drill, baby, drill.” In a <em><em>Wall Street Journal </em></em>opinion <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/jd-vance-harris-wages-war-on-us-energy-inflation-net-zero-2024-presidential-election-aaf19e44?st=ee1dwloqzje3osg&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8qFlBsU6v0UmHJGnpdXzIRgptzViwLtA7l2gQVmAOSdz-EtnQ4ssVXE0sbCiXgq8YJhWmm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">piece</a>, Vance claimed Harris “cares more about climate change than about inflation.” A <em><em>New York Times</em></em>/Sienna poll last week <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/10/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voter-crosstabs.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8qFlBsU6v0UmHJGnpdXzIRgptzViwLtA7l2gQVmAOSdz-EtnQ4ssVXE0sbCiXgq8YJhWmm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">showed</a> Harris inching ahead of Trump in Pennsylvania, as well as in Michigan and Wisconsin.</p><p>Allies have encouraged Harris to lean into the environmental wins of the past four years, including the Inflation Reduction Act, but it’s anyone’s guess how much of her big speech on Thursday will be about climate. For his part, President Biden used his moment in the spotlight yesterday to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/19/politics/fact-check-night-one-democratic-national-convention/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8qFlBsU6v0UmHJGnpdXzIRgptzViwLtA7l2gQVmAOSdz-EtnQ4ssVXE0sbCiXgq8YJhWmm" target="_blank">tout</a> emission reductions and his initiatives to expand EV charging stations across the country.</p><h3>2.

The ads frame the current administration’s climate and energy policies as economic wins. “The goal of her presidency: strengthen America’s middle class,” one ad says. “We get there by investing in growing fields like advanced manufacturing and clean energy – good-paying jobs that don’t need a four-year degree.” The ad campaign is backed by L.C.V. Victory Fund, E.D.F. Action Votes, Climate Power Action, and the Future Forward super PAC.</p><h3>3. Maine to build first U.S. floating offshore wind research site</h3><p><strong></strong>The first floating offshore wind research site in the U.S. will be located in the Gulf of Maine. The Biden administration this week <a href="https://www.maine.gov/energy/initiatives/offshorewind/researcharray?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8qFlBsU6v0UmHJGnpdXzIRgptzViwLtA7l2gQVmAOSdz-EtnQ4ssVXE0sbCiXgq8YJhWmm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued</a> a lease for the research site, which “will inform how floating offshore wind operates and can co-exist with ocean users and ecosystems,” the Maine governor’s office said in a statement. The area is about 28 nautical miles from the shore and covers 9,700 acres, enough to accommodate 12 floating offshore wind turbines designed by the University of Maine. Floating offshore wind platforms enable wind power generation in deeper waters, and the Interior Department has a <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/floating-offshore-wind-shot?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8qFlBsU6v0UmHJGnpdXzIRgptzViwLtA7l2gQVmAOSdz-EtnQ4ssVXE0sbCiXgq8YJhWmm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">goal</a> of deploying 15 gigawatts of floating capacity by 2035.

## Powell may use Jackson Hole speech to hint at how fast, how far Fed could cut rates

date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Federal Reserve officials have said they're increasingly confident that they've nearly tamed inflation. Now, it's the health of the job market that's starting to draw their concern.


With inflation cooling toward its 2% target, the pace of hiring slowing and the unemployment rate edging up, the Fed is poised to cut its benchmark interest rate next month from its 23-year high. How fast it may cut rates after that, though, will be determined mainly by whether employers keep hiring. A lower Fed benchmark rate would eventually lead to lower rates for auto loans, mortgages and other forms of consumer borrowing.


Chair Jerome Powell will likely provide some hints about how the Fed sees the economy and what its next steps may be in a high-profile speech Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at the Fed's annual conference of central bankers. It's a platform that Powell and his predecessors have often used to signal changes in their thinking or approach.


Powell will likely indicate that the Fed has grown more confident that inflation is headed back to the 2% target, which it has long said would be necessary before rate cuts would begin.




Economists generally agree that the Fed is getting closer to conquering high inflation, which brought financial pain to millions of households beginning three years ago as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession. Few economists, though, think Powell or any other Fed official is prepared to declare “mission accomplished."


“I don't think that the Fed has to fear inflation,” said Tom Porcelli, U.S. chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income. “At this point, it's right that the Fed is now more focused on labor versus inflation. Their policy is calibrated for inflation that is much higher than this.”


Still, how fast the Fed cuts rates in the coming months will depend on what the economic data shows. After the government reported this month that hiring in July was much less than expected and that the jobless rate reached 4.3%, the highest in three years, stock prices plunged for two days on fears that the U.S. might fall into a recession. Some economists began speculating about a half-point Fed rate cut in September and perhaps another identical cut in November.


But healthier economic reports last week, including another decline in inflation and a robust gain in retail sales, have largely dispelled those concerns. Wall Street traders now expect three quarter-point Fed cuts in September, November and December, though in December it's nearly a coin-toss between a quarter- and a half-point cut. Mortgage rates have already started to decline in anticipation of a rate reduction.


A half-point Fed rate cut in September would become more likely if there were signs of a further slowdown in hiring, some officials have said. The next jobs report will be issued on Sept. 6, after the Jackson Hole conference but before the Fed's next meeting in mid-September.


Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed's Atlanta branch, said in an interview Monday with The Associated Press that "evidence of accelerating weakness in labor markets may warrant a more rapid move, either in terms of the increments of movement or the speed at which we try to get back” to a level of rates that no longer restricts the economy.




Even if hiring stays solid, the Fed is set to cut rates this year given the steady progress that's been made on inflation, economists say. Last week, the government said consumer prices rose just 2.9% in July from a year ago, the smallest such increase in more than three years.


Bostic noted that the economy has changed from just a couple of months ago, when he was suggesting that a rate cut might not be necessary until the final three months of the year.


“I’ve got more confidence that we are likely to get to our target for inflation,” he said. “And we’ve seen labor markets weaken considerably relative to where they were" last year. “We might need to shift our policy stance sooner than I would have thought before.”


Both Bostic and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, say that with inflation falling, inflation-adjusted interest rates — which are what many businesses and investors pay most attention to — are rising even as inflation has slowed. When the Fed first set its key rate at its current 5.3%, inflation — excluding volatile energy and food costs — was 4.7%. Now, it's just 3.2%.


“Our policies are getting tighter with every moment in that type of situation,” Bostic said. “We have to be concerned” that rates are so high they could cause an economic slowdown.


Still, Bostic said that for now, the job market and the economy appear mostly healthy, and he still expects a “soft landing," whereby inflation falls back to the Fed's 2% target without a recession occurring.


With the economy's outlook unclear and the Fed focusing heavily on what future data shows, there may be only so much Powell will be able to say Friday about the central bank's next steps.


Given the Fed's focus on how the economic data comes in, “it will be difficult for Powell to pre-commit to a particular trajectory at Jackson Hole,” Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, said in a research note.

## 2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue

date: 2024-08-20, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-19-something-new-intrigue">2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue</h1>

<p>A while ago, <a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social">@enfors</a> said he wanted his sandbox generator supplement to have something special.
I wasn&rsquo;t exactly sure what he was thinking of, but I started thinking about the things that I feel are under-explored.</p>

<p>A while ago, for example, I wondered: What would be the simplest game that emphasises how many friends you make, that rewards the size of the community you build?
Back in 2016 I wrote a game called <a href="2016-08-19_Romantic_Fantasy">Best Friends</a> that I never used.
It was <a href="2019-10-10_Non-adventure_games%3F">still an adventure game</a>.
Basically, replace your &ldquo;level&rdquo; with the number of friends you have.
Something like that.</p>

<p>But that still doesn&rsquo;t get into really new territory.
Something I would like to see is a system for how to run an intrigue as a party – including everybody at the table, for all the classes and skill profiles.
I feel that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> attempted to do this but the result wasn’t great, at least at my table.</p>

<p>Quoting my past self:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m also not too happy with A Song of Ice and Fire. We’ve only played three times, so I’m willing to give it more time. When I ran one of the sessions I basically split the party to the max since since all characters are so diverse. There is no D&amp;D like party and that also requires me to rethink my adventure design. – <a href="2010-04-08_Spring">2010-04-08 Spring</a></p>

<p>I can always switch into a movie director stance, go around the table, point at players, “now you!” and after a bit when the exchange happened and a die was maybe cast, “as we wait for that, we cut to…” and soon enough “in the mean time…” – and I do this aggressively, in small time slots. This results in a somewhat military style of pointing at people to let them know that now is their turn, while simultaneously waving at others to hold their thoughts, or maybe cutting talkative players off when they’re running too long. It’s weird, but when there’s a lot of players, or when there’s no party play to return to, it works well enough. We’ve made these kinds of mistakes in games where there are characters that are well suited for fighting and others that are not, with their players trying to solve problems by fighting, and players do not. This happened to me when I ran a one-shot of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>. It worked for a session, but it was exhausting and I don’t want to claim that it’s a good solution. It was simply a short term solution that worked, for me. Next time, however, make sure players create characters that will adventure together. – <a href="2021-02-27_Cohesion">2021-02-27 Cohesion</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the split into combat and intrigue that the game introduced wasn&rsquo;t good game design because it made sense from the perspective of emulating the books but it didn&rsquo;t make sense from the perspective of some people wanting to play a game together. Or maybe it just didn&rsquo;t fit my expectations of what it means to play together. Or maybe we just missed the implied recommendation to focus on either combat or intrigue and everybody having two characters, one for each domain. Or maybe just run either a combat campaign or an intrigue campaign.</p>

<p>So what I&rsquo;m looking for is a way to get intrigue results, using procedures like we do for combat or exploration, for dungeons or the wilderness. The goal is to bring about a change in leadership of a town, a gang, a castle, an army unit, or to succeed in an act of sabotage, to incite a rebellion – things that are either hand-waved or the party is hired for the dirty work while the non-player characters are the politicians and rabble-rousers. I know this can work. It&rsquo;s OK for the party to do the dirty work, to assassinate a tyrant and the non-player characters then taking the throne and similar things, but I want to go further. I want to involve all the players at the table. I want the players to think about the logistics of war, the organising and preparations of revolutions, the intricacies of marriage politics.</p>

<p>What if B/X D&amp;D went levels 1–3 is for dungeons, 4–6 is for the wilderness and 7–9 is <em>for politics</em>. Doesn&rsquo;t that sound fantastic? What sort of rules would you find in that third book? You would not get to name level by being a colonizer and clearing the land but by taking over an existing position of power – through intrigue. Oust the abbot, kick out the bishop, marry into the baron&rsquo;s family, take over the guild. With the help of your friends. Without resorting to combat, but with dice rolling.</p>

<p>The dice rolling and the procedures are important to me because otherwise it all goes in a direction I don’t like: <a href="2014-08-21_No_Dice">the referee decides everything and that is exhausting</a>.</p>

<p>Not something like Burning Wheel&rsquo;s Duel of Wits but something like social combat for Fate games, like the <a href="social-combat">social combat system in Diaspora</a>, for example. Note <a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@bradjmurray" title="@bradjmurray@dice.camp">@bradjmurray</a>&rsquo;s most recent take on those rules: <a href="https://vscadotblog.wordpress.com/2020/02/20/social-combat-in-diaspora/">social combat in diaspora</a>.</p>

<p>This space deserves more attention.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RPG">#RPG</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-08-20</strong>. I find that urban adventures suffer from the same problem. If it&rsquo;s just two or three buildings and those act like dungeons, my games work. If it&rsquo;s just social encounters that can be resolved with reaction rolls, my games work. But everything else in an urban environment seems to be politics, to me. And I have no good procedures to resolve those. So if anybody reading this is thinking about writing a blog post on the topic, I&rsquo;d love to read it.</p>

## Final report outlines missed opportunities to stop Maine's deadliest shooting

date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA

LEWISTON, Maine  — Both the Army Reserve and police missed opportunities to intervene in a gunman's psychiatric crisis and initiate steps to seize weapons from the spiraling reservist responsible for the deadliest shootings in Maine history, according to the final report released Tuesday by a special commission created to investigate the attacks, which killed 18 people.


The independent commission, which held 16 public meetings, heard from scores of witnesses and reviewed thousands of pages of evidence, reiterated its earlier conclusion that Maine law enforcement officers had authority under the state's yellow flag law, but didn't use it, to seize reservist Robert Card's guns and put him in protective custody weeks before the shootings.


The 215-page report also faulted the Army Reserve for failing to do more to ensure Card's health and deal with his weapons. And it pointed out that no one used New York's red flag law to initiate steps to seize the gunman's weapons when he was hospitalized last summer, even though the law had been used on non-New York residents before.


The commission, created by Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, announced its conclusions at Lewiston City Hall, less than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the two sites where the shootings took place Oct. 25, 2023.


"Our ability to heal — as a people and as a state — is predicated on the ability to know and understand, to the greatest extent possible, the facts and circumstances surrounding the tragedy in Lewiston. The release of the independent commission's final report marks another step forward on that long road to healing," the governor said in a statement.


While the report contained no major surprises, the commission's chair, Daniel Wathen, noted the facts laid out in the document can be used by others to make changes to prevent future tragedies.


Megan Vozzella, who lost her husband two weeks shy of their first anniversary, expressed through an American Sign Language interpreter that she wants accountability for those who failed to act to stop the shootings.


"We are dealing with grief, loss of our loved ones. And it's a journey. All we can do is learn from this and make our lives better," she said, likening the process to dealing with broken pieces. "It's like we're walking through the shards," she said.


Ben Gideon, a lawyer for Vozzella and other relatives of those who died, described the shootings as the product of a dangerous intersection of gun ownership and mental illness with failures to intervene that were outlined in the report.


"At the end of the day, what happened here was a pairing of someone who was known to be paranoid, delusional and suffering from a diagnosed psychosis with someone who owned numerous weapons of warfare," Gideon said.


The commission began its work a month after the mass shootings by Card, who killed his victims at a bowling alley and a bar in Lewiston and then took his own life. Over nine months, there has been emotional testimony from family members and survivors of the shooting, law enforcement officials and U.S. Army Reserve personnel, and others.


The commission praised the swift response by police to the shootings but also noted what Wathen, a former chief justice of Maine's highest court, described Tuesday as "utter chaos" as hundreds of law enforcement officers arrived to search for the gunman.


Family members and fellow reservists said Card had exhibited delusional and paranoid behavior months before the shootings. He was hospitalized by the Army during training in July 2023 in New York, where his unit was training West Point cadets, but Army Reserve officials acknowledged that no one made sure Card was taking his medication or complying with his follow-up care at home in Bowdoin, Maine.


The starkest warning came in September text from a fellow reservist: "I believe he's going to snap and do a mass shooting."


The commission report contained new details of Card's time at a private psychiatric hospital — Four Winds in Katonah, New York — where Card acknowledged having a "hit list" and officials planned to ask a judge to extend Card's hospitalization. But the court hearing never happened, and his psychiatrist felt the hospital's request would have been unsuccessful, given Card's stabilization and progress and his agreement to continue medications and participate in therapy. The psychiatrist thought he was safe to discharge after 19 days.


The report also took up New York's red flag law but didn't reach a conclusion on whether it should have been used to initiate the removal of Card's weapons while he was hospitalized at Four Winds. An Army health care worker testified he thought the law applied only to New York residents. But the report noted that petitions were successfully initiated in New York against at least 10 nonresidents, like Card, between 2021 and June 2024.


Army officials conducted their own investigation after the shootings that Lt. Gen. Jody Daniels, then the chief of the Army Reserve, said found "a series of failures by unit leadership." Three Army Reserve leaders were disciplined for dereliction of duty, according to the report.


After the shootings, Maine's Legislature passed new guns laws for the state, which has a tradition of hunting and firearms ownership, after the shootings. A three-day waiting period for gun purchases went into effect this month.


In addition to Wathen, the seven-member commission included two former federal prosecutors; two additional former judges, including a former member Maine's highest court; the state's former chief forensic psychologist; and a private psychiatrist who is an executive at a psychiatric hospital.

## Firefighters significantly tame California's fourth-largest wildfire on record

date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA

CHICO, Calif. — California's largest wildfire this year has been significantly tamed as the state's initially fierce fire season has, at least temporarily, fallen into a relative calm.


The Park Fire was 53% contained Monday after scorching nearly 1,738 square kilometers in several northern counties, destroying 637 structures and damaging 49 as it became the state's fourth-largest wildfire on record.


A large portion of the fire area has been in mop-up stages, which involves extinguishing smoldering material along containment lines, and residents of evacuated areas are returning home. Timber in its northeast corner continues to burn.


The fire is burning islands of vegetation within containment lines, the Cal Fire situation summary said.


The Park Fire was allegedly started by arson on July 24 in a wilderness park outside the Central Valley city of Chico. It spread northward with astonishing speed in withering conditions as it climbed the western slope of the Sierra Nevada.


July was marked by extraordinary heat in most of California, where back-to-back wet winters left the state flush with grasses and vegetation that dried and became ready to burn. Wildfires erupted up and down the state.


The first half of August has been warmer than average but not record-breaking, according to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles.


“We’re still seeing pretty regular ignitions and we’re still seeing significant fire activity, but the pace has slowed and the degree of that activity, the intensity, rates of initial spread, are not as high as they were,” he said in an online briefing Friday.


“Nonetheless, vegetation remains drier than average in most places in California and will likely remain so nearly everywhere in California for the foreseeable future,” he said.


There are signs of a return of high heat in parts of the West by late August and early September, Swain said.


“I would expect to see another resurgence in wildfire activity then across a broad swath of the West, including California,” he said.

## Biden gets rousing ovation, gives Harris enthusiastic endorsement

date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA

Chicago — President Joe Biden delivered his valedictory address to the Democratic National Convention on Monday night, as his decision to end his reelection bid released newfound energy within his party with Vice President Kamala Harris' elevation to the top of the ticket.




After 52 years rising to the pinnacle of influence within his party, Biden, 81, received a hero's welcome for the act of stepping aside for Harris, weeks after many in his party were pressuring him to drop his bid for reelection. One month after an unprecedented mid-campaign switch, the opening night of the convention in Chicago was designed to give a graceful exit to the incumbent president and slingshot Harris toward a faceoff with Republican Donald Trump, whose comeback bid for the White House is viewed by Democrats as an existential threat.


A visibly emotional Biden was greeted by a more than four-minute-long ovation and chants of "Thank you, Joe."


"America, I love you," he replied.


Speaking clearly and energetically, Biden appeared to relish the chance to defend his record, advocate for his vice president and go on the attack against Trump. His delivery was more reminiscent of the Biden who won in 2020 than the mumbling and sometimes incoherent one-time candidate whose debate performance against Trump in June sparked the downfall of his reelection campaign.


Biden, in his remarks, repeated his 2020 theme that "we're in a battle for the very soul of America," and pressed the case for why Harris and her running mate Tim Walz were best prepared to wage it.


"Because of you, we've had the most extraordinary four years of progress ever, period," Biden declared. And then he interjected, "I say 'we,' I mean me and Kamala,'" sharing the credit for his most popular successes with the vice president to whom he handed over his political operation.




Harris made an unannounced appearance onstage as the convention's prime-time program began Monday evening to thank Biden for his leadership and watched his remarks from the stands.


"Joe, thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of service to our nation, and for all you'll continue to do," she said. "We are forever grateful to you."


Biden's speech, billed as the marquee event of the evening, was pushed into late night as the convention program lagged more than an hour behind schedule.


The president recalled the 2017 "unite the right" rally, when torch-carrying white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, an episode he cites as cementing his decision to run for president in 2020 despite his ongoing grief over the death of his son Beau Biden.


"I could not stay on the sidelines," Biden said. "So I ran. I had no intention of running again. I'd just lost part of my soul. But I ran with a deep conviction."


Biden celebrated the successes from his administration, including a massive boost in infrastructure spending and a cap on the price of insulin. The spending resulted in more money going to Republican-leaning states than Democratic states, he said, because "the job of the president is to deliver for all of America."


During one of the crowd's many chants of "thank you, Joe," he added, "Thank you, Kamala, too."


Not even a month ago, Democrats were riven over foreign policy, political strategy and Biden himself, who was holding on after a disastrous debate by claiming he had a better chance than any other Democrat — including Harris — of beating Trump.


On Monday, Biden insisted he did not harbor any ill will to the many voices in the arena before him who had pushed him to the exits and called on the party to unite around Harris. Accusing Trump of "bowing down" to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden said, "I never have and I promise you Kamala Harris will never do it."


"She'll be a president we can all be proud of," he said.


First lady Jill Biden alluded to her husband's wrenching decision to leave the race in her remarks minutes before Biden took the stage. She said she fell in love with him all over again "just weeks ago, when I saw him dig deep into his soul and decide to no longer seek reelection and endorse Kamala Harris."


Still, there was little question that the Democratic Party would almost certainly have been in a far worse state if Biden had continued to cling to his campaign, despite growing concerns about his mental and physical acuity after struggling to complete sentences during his debate against Trump.


Democrats took turns praising Biden's leadership and his choice in Harris to succeed him. "I've never known a more compassionate man than Joe Biden," said his longtime confidant Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who led the crowd in a "we love Joe" chant.


They tried to connect both Biden and Harris to what the party sees as the governing pair's most popular accomplishments: leading the country out of the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, pushing for massive investments in the country's infrastructure, working to lower health care costs and promoting clean energy.


"Thanks to Joe and Kamala, we reduced the price of prescription drugs, repaired roads and bridges and replaced lead pipes," said South Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn, whose 2020 endorsement was critical to Biden winning that primary. He added that one of Biden's best decisions was "selecting Kamala Harris as his vice president and endorsing her to succeed him."


Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was greeted with prolonged applause, saluted Harris while noting her potential to break the "highest, hardest glass ceiling" to become America's first female president. Clinton was the Democratic nominee in 2016, but she lost that election to Trump.


"Together, we've put a lot of cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling," Clinton said, invoking a metaphor she referenced in her concession speech eight years ago. "On the other side of that glass ceiling is Kamala Harris taking the oath of office as our 47th president of the United States. When a barrier falls for one of us, it clears the way for all of us."


Clinton also saluted Biden for stepping aside, saying, "Now we are writing a new chapter in America's story."


Highlighting the party's generational reach, Clinton, 76, followed New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 34, who endorsed Harris while delivering the first mention of the war in Gaza from the convention stage, addressing an issue that has split the party's base ever since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack and Israel's resulting offensive.


Outside the arena, thousands of protesters descended on Chicago to decry the Biden-Harris administration's support for the Israeli war effort.


Harris "is working tirelessly to secure a cease-fire in Gaza and bringing the hostages home," Ocasio-Cortez said, drawing cheers from the crowd.


Biden acknowledged the protests outside the convention and inside the arena as he spoke, saying, "Those protesters out in the street have a point. A lot of innocent people are being killed on both sides." He reiterated his push to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a cease-fire deal that would also see the release of hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 in the attack that sparked the 10-month war.


Meanwhile, Democrats also looked to keep the focus on Trump, whose criminal convictions they mocked and who they asserted was only fighting for himself, rather than "for the people" — the night's official theme.


Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow hoisted an oversized copy of "Project 2025" — a blueprint for a second Trump term that was put together by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank — onto the lectern and quoted from portions of it.


"So we read it," McMorrow said. "Whatever you think it might be. It is so much worse."


Trump, the former president, has publicly disavowed any interests in the policies outlined in Project 2025, but he has close ties to its authors and campaign aides had praised its work in the past.


Democrats kept abortion access front and center for voters, betting that the issue will propel them to success as it has in other key races since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. Speakers Monday included three women whose health care suffered as a result of that decision. And the convention program included a video of Trump praising his own role in getting Roe struck down.

## DNC's Day 1: Biden's exit, talk of the glass ceiling, nod to Gaza protesters

date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — The Democratic National Convention 's first night showcased speeches from the last Democrat to lose to Donald Trump and the last one to beat him.


Hillary Clinton spoke hopefully of finally breaking the "glass ceiling" to elect a female president. Joe Biden laced into Trump and directly acknowledged the concerns of protesters against the war in Gaza who demonstrated a few blocks from the convention hall.


Here are some takeaways from the first night of the convention.


Biden begins long political exit


President Joe Biden wrapped up the convention's opening night by beginning his long political farewell with an address that both framed his own legacy and signaled he was ready to start ceding control of the party to Vice President Kamala Harris.


He took the stage to a long, raucous ovation from delegates hoisting "We love Joe" placards and told them in turn, "I love you!" After the affectionate opening, Biden spent long stretches of his 50-minute speech lacing into Trump, returning to a key theme of the reelection campaign he's no longer running.




Biden ticked through many of his administration's achievements, including a major public works package and climate program, and shared the credit with Harris. But the convention ran so late that Biden took the stage after prime time had ended in much of the country. That didn't stop Biden from declaring, "America's winning."


Biden called Harris a "close friend" and said picking her as his running mate was the best decision he ever made. He also vowed to help get the new Democratic ticket elected, promising to be the "best volunteer" that Harris and Walz have ever seen.


He ended by telling those still listening, "I gave my best to you for 50 years."


He had no plan to linger at the convention, though. Biden was set to fly to California's wine country for a vacation immediately after his speech.


A surprise Harris appearance to pay tribute to Biden


The vice president made an unscheduled appearance onstage to pay tribute to Biden ahead of his own address to the convention. She told the president, "Thank you for your historic leadership, for your lifetime of service to our nation, and for all you'll continue to do."


On a night meant to honor the president who stepped aside to make way for Harris, the vice president added, "We are forever grateful to you." Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and her husband, Doug Emhoff, were in the stands to cheer her message.


Gaza gets little attention inside DNC hall — except from Biden


Thousands of marchers churned through Chicago's streets protesting U.S. support for Israel during the war in Gaza. But inside the convention hall, the combustible issue went largely unmentioned until Biden got to the microphone.


Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez got cheers when she praised Harris for working "tirelessly to get a cease-fire in Gaza and get the hostages home." Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia made a brief allusion to the conflict.


A handful of delegates who ran on an "uncommitted" ticket protesting Biden's position on the war unfurled a banner during his speech that read "Stop Arming Israel." But it was blocked by supporters waving Biden signs before it was wrestled away and the lights over that section of the audience were shut off.


Biden himself addressed the issue head-on, saying he'd keep working to "end the war in Gaza and bring peace and security to the Middle East."


"Those protesters out in the streets have a point," Biden said. "A lot of innocent people are being killed, on both sides."


The crowd cheered, and for a moment the war didn't seem like it was dividing the party at all.


Clinton revives talk of breaking that 'glass ceiling'


Clinton was greeted with wild and sustained applause that lasted for more than two minutes before she quieted the crowd. She delivered a fiery speech hoping that Harris could do what she could not –- become the first woman president by beating Trump.


Clinton evoked her 2016 concession speech by referencing all the "cracks in the glass ceiling" that she and her voters had achieved. And she painted a vision of Harris "on the other side of that glass ceiling" taking the oath of office as president.


She closed her speech with a striking desire for someone who's stood at the pinnacle of American politics and power: "I want my grandchildren and their grandchildren to know I was here at this moment. That we were here and that we were with Kamala Harris every step of the way."


Clinton dipped into traditional political attacks in her speech, including mocking Trump's criminal record. That led to chants of "lock him up" — mirroring the ones that Trump's supporters directed at Clinton in 2016.


Tracing a line from Jesse Jackson to Kamala Harris


An early theme of the evening was celebrating the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a longtime civil rights leader in Chicago and former presidential candidate in 1984 and 1988. Many Democrats credit him with blazing a trail that helped Barack Obama win the White House in 2008 and Kamala Harris become the first woman of color nominated for the presidency.


Jackson was saluted from the stage by several speakers, including Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and California Rep. Maxine Waters. There was a video montage of Jackson's career and legacy that played before the 82-year-old Jackson himself came to the stage in a wheelchair, thrusting his arms skyward and grinning. Jackson has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.


During the 1984 Democratic convention in San Francisco, Jackson gave a speech declaring that America is "like a quilt: Many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread." The address became known as the "Rainbow Coalition" speech, and Jackson used momentum from it to seek the Democratic nomination again in 1988.


Harris has called Jackson "one of America's greatest patriots."


Remember COVID? Democrats don't want voters — or Trump — to forget


Democrats opted to shine the convention spotlight on the harrowing subject of the coronavirus pandemic.


It was a reflection of Democratic frustration at how Trump has portrayed his tenure in office as a golden age for the country, even though hundreds of thousands of Americans died of COVID-19 during the last year of his term.


There are plenty of risks for Democrats in hammering the pandemic. Even more people died of the virus during Biden's presidency than during Trump's, voters have shown an eagerness to move on and some preventative measures championed by Democrats — like school closures and masking — are not popular in retrospect.


Still, the lineup of early speakers focused on Trump's performance during the pandemic. Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan recalled how her brother was the second person in Tennessee to die of the disease and how she couldn't visit him or hold a memorial service. Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois, a nurse, said of Trump: "He took the COVID crisis and turned it into a catastrophe. We can never ever let him be our president again."


Rep. Robert Garcia, whose mother and stepfather died of the disease in 2020, recalled Trump's missteps and concluded with one of the slogans of Harris' young campaign: "We are not going back."


Democrats one-up Republicans on labor


Trump's convention last month featured a rare appearance from a union leader at such a GOP event: Teamsters President Sean O'Brien. That's reflective of how Trump's populism has cut into Democrats' advantage with union households.


In that speech, O'Brien did not endorse Trump. But he criticized both major political parties for not doing enough to help working people.


Democrats didn't invite O'Brien to their convention, but they countered with a half-dozen other union leaders onstage Monday. And then Shawn Fain, head of the United Auto Workers, led a blistering chant of "Trump's a scab!" while wearing a red T-shirt emblazoned with those words.


Fain noted that Biden visited a UAW picket line last year and, when autoworkers struck in 2019, Harris, not Trump, walked the picket lines. "Donald Trump is all talk and Kamala Harris walks the walk," Fain said.

## Jury hears ex-politician on trial for murder amassed photos, ID records about slain Vegas reporter

date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA

Las Vegas — Hundreds of photos of a slain investigative journalist's home and neighborhood were found on the cellphone and computer of a local Democratic politician accused of "lying in wait" and killing the reporter, who had written several articles critical of the official, a Nevada jury was told Monday.


Other photos taken from Robert Telles' devices included an image of a single gray athletic shoe with a distinctive black pattern and a shot of Telles' work computer at the Clark County Public Administrator and Guardian office with results of internet searches through a password-protected site that retrieved slain reporter Jeff German's name, home address, vehicle registration and date of birth.


Prosecutor Christopher Hamner noted for jurors that photo was taken Aug. 23, 2022 — less than two weeks before German was slashed and stabbed to death in a side yard of his home.


"This image came out of Mr. Telles' phone?" Hamner asked Matthew Hovanec, a Las Vegas digital forensics supervisor who testified Monday about "extracting" the data from Telles' devices.


"It did," Hovanec responded.


Detective Justine Gatus, the primary Las Vegas police homicide investigator of German's death, was the main — and final — witness called Monday as prosecutors rested their case after four days of testimony from more than two dozen witnesses.


Telles has pleaded not guilty to murder and faces the possibility of life in prison if the jury finds him guilty. Prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty.


Telles insists he didn't kill German and was framed for the crime. He intends to testify, defense lawyer Robert Draskovich said Monday, and is expected to take the witness stand to cap his own defense case, possibly Tuesday afternoon.


Gatus cited Las Vegas Review-Journal articles about Telles and the county office that German wrote, published in May and June 2022, about a county office in turmoil.


"They weren't flattering," the detective observed.


Social media posts by Telles at the same time derided German and the articles as false depictions of his efforts to fight corruption amid a political and social "old guard" real estate network.


Gatus testified that the gray sneaker with a Nike logo and four black marks on the sole was "identical" to one jurors saw earlier in neighbors' security camera images of a figure wearing orange who slipped into a side yard of German's home where German was later found dead on Labor Day weekend 2022.


Neither an orange shirt nor a murder weapon was entered as evidence in the case. But one of those shoes, cut to pieces and bearing spots of blood from an unidentified source, was found in plastic shopping bag in Telles' home following his arrest.


German's killing in September 2022, at age 69, made him the only reporter killed in the U.S. among 69 news media workers killed worldwide that year, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. German spent 44 years covering Las Vegas mobsters and public officials at the Las Vegas Sun and then at the rival Review-Journal.


About 10 of his family members and friends have attended each day of Telles' trial but have not spoken publicly about the killing. They declined as a group on Monday to comment.


Jurors last week heard from forensic scientists who said Telles' DNA was found beneath German's fingernails and saw security video of the suspect driving through German's neighborhood.

## Democrats approve platform that mentions Biden's 'second term' despite his making way for Harris

date: 2024-08-20, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — Delegates at the Democratic National Convention voted Monday night to approve their 2024 party platform, which lays out familiar priorities for the party but wasn't updated to reflect that President Joe Biden is no longer running for reelection.


The largely ceremonial vote at Chicago's convention signaled the party coalescing around a singular vision for the next four years — though a somewhat outdated one, as Vice President Kamala Harris has only outlined a few of her own specific policy positions since she took over the Democratic presidential ticket last month. The platform makes repeated reference to Biden's "second term" despite the president's decision a month ago to no longer seek one.


The Democratic National Committee said the more than 90-page document "makes a strong statement about the historic work that President Biden and Vice President Harris have accomplished hand-in-hand and offers a vision for a progressive agenda that we can build on as a nation and as a Party as we head into the next four years."


Regina Romero, the mayor of Tucson, Arizona, and co-chair of the convention platform committee, told delegates that the platform was passed "prior to the president passing the torch in an act of love and patriotism." She said that the platform nonetheless included input from all corners of the party and has a "forward-looking vision for our party that echoes the voice of all."


"Vice President Harris is now carrying the torch," Romero said.


The platform was approved on the floor by a voice vote.


The convention's platform committee voted to approve the platform on July 16, days before Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris on July 21. As a result, the document repeatedly refers to Biden's second term and his administration's accomplishments. It mentions Harris' work as vice president but does not describe her candidacy or go into detail on her views on key issues.


"President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Democrats are running to finish the job," it states, a sentiment that is now out of date.


Republican former President Donald Trump's campaign has sought to tie Harris to Biden, arguing that his policies on the economy and other key issues are deeply unpopular. In a statement released shortly before the convention vote, it said, "There is no daylight between Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. The proof? The DNC just released Kamala's party platform, and it includes at least (asterisk)nineteen(asterisk) mentions of 'Biden's second term.'"


Harris has indeed talked generally about supporting the Biden administration's key goals, which are more or less endorsed in the platform as written. It calls for restoring abortion rights nationwide, continuing to advance green energy initiatives that can create jobs and help slow climate change, capping low-income families' child care costs and urging Congress to approve a pathway to U.S. citizenship for "long-term" people in the country illegally.


The platform also says Israel's right to defend itself is "ironclad" while endorsing the Biden administration's efforts to broker a lasting cease-fire deal that could suspend the fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.


Harris laid out a string of new economic proposals last week but otherwise hasn't released a detailed list of her policy positions since taking over the top of the Democratic ticket. Her campaign aides have suggested she no longer adheres to some of the more liberal positions she took during her first run for president in 2020, including endorsing a ban on hydraulic fracturing.


In any event, candidates are not bound to adhere to their party's platform and often don't. What the platforms spell out usually has little effect on the race and is unlikely to have much impact on Election Day this cycle.

Note: I had a quote here that <a href="https://www.threads.net/@actor_keanureeves_59/post/C-2Xy0mtOk4">appeared</a> to be from actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanu_Reeves">Keanu Reeves</a>. It was a good sentiment, but it apparently was not from Reeves. Thanks to <a href="https://mastodon.social/@andypiper@macaw.social/112995751255063774">Andy Piper</a> for catching this. Here's the quote. "If you see someone falling behind, walk beside them. If you see someone being ignored, find a way to include them. Always remind people of their worth. One small act could mean the world to them."

## Procreate’s anti-AI pledge attracts praise from digital creatives

<p>[<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/19/24223473/procreate-anti-generative-ai-pledge-digital-illustration-creatives">Jess Weatherbed at The Verge</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"“Generative AI is ripping the humanity out of things. Built on a foundation of theft, the technology is steering us toward a barren future,” Procreate said on the new AI section of its website. “We think machine learning is a compelling technology with a lot of merit, but the path generative AI is on is wrong for us.”"</p></blockquote><p>This is a company that knows its audience: the lack of concern for artist welfare demonstrated by AI vendors has understandably not made the technology popular with that community. Adobe got into trouble with its userbase for adding those generative AI features.</p><p>It's a great way for Procreate to deepen its relationship with artists and take advantage of Adobe's fall from grace. There's also something a bit deeper here: if work created with generative AI does run into copyright trouble at the hands of current and future lawsuits, work created with Procreate will be clean of those issues.</p>
