<p>
Well, it’s happening. The days of a carefully curated
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Minimalissimo</a>
are over. Carl has decided to take a break after 10 years running the
site and I’m taking over which means chaos is about to ensue.
</p>
<p>
Just kidding. I am taking over the site though.
<a href="https://carlbarenbrug.com/minimalissimo-departure" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Carl
has written about the reasons behind his decision on his blog</a> so if
you want to know more head over to his blog. He was willing to just
leave the site up as an archive and stop posting but I can’t let that
happen.
</p>
<p>
Minimalissimo is such a nice project and has a massive archive so I
offered to take over the day-to-day operations. But I had one condition
and that was that I must be allowed to experiment with the site because
you know I can’t help myself when it comes to play with online site
projects.
</p>
<p>
I plan to write about the whole experience throughout the year and I’m
going to be very transparent about it so if you’re interested in some
behind-the-scenes keep an eye on this blog.

<p>
Minimalissimo <em>”Manu Edition”</em> starts on January 1st. Gonna be a
fun 2024.

id="naval-officer-jailed-in-japan-in-deadly-crash-transferred-to-us-custody-his-family-says">Naval
Officer Jailed in Japan in Deadly Crash Transferred to US Custody, His
Family Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A Navy officer jailed in Japan over a deadly car crash
that killed two Japanese citizens has been transferred into U.S. custody
and is being returned to the United States, his family said
Thursday.</p>
<p>Lt. Ridge Alkonis had been serving a three-year prison sentence after
pleading guilty to the negligent driving deaths of an elderly woman and
her son-in-law in May 2021.</p>
<p>“After 507 days, Lt. Ridge Alkonis is on his way home to the United
States. We are encouraged by Ridge’s transfer back to the United States
but cannot celebrate until Ridge has been reunited with his family,” the
family, based in Dana Point, California, said in a statement to The
Associated Press. “We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Government to
effect this transfer and are glad that an impartial set of judiciary
eyes will review his case for the first time.”</p>
<p>It was unclear where in the U.S. Alkonis is heading or whether upon
his arrival in the country he might be required to spend any additional
time behind bars under the terms of his transfer from Japan.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the efforts of the U.S. Government to effect this
transfer and are glad that an impartial set of judiciary eyes will
review his case for the first time,” the family statement said.</p>
<p>The statement added: “When the Biden Administration is presented with
the complete set of facts and circumstances surrounding the case, we’re
confident they will promptly recognize the absurdity of Ridge’s
conviction.”</p>
<p>Alkonis’ family has said the naval officer abruptly lost
consciousness in the car after a lunch and ice cream excursion with his
wife and children to Mount Fuji, causing him to slump over behind the
wheel after suffering acute mountain sickness. But Japanese prosecutors
and the judge who sentenced him contend he fell asleep while drowsy,
shirking a duty to pull over immediately.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2021, after a period of land-based assignments, the
Southern California native was preparing for a deployment as a
department head on the USS Benfold, a missile destroyer.</p>
<p>On May 29, 2021, with the assignment looming, his family set out for
an excursion of Mount Fuji hiking and sightseeing.</p>
<p>They had climbed a portion of the mountain and were back in the car,
heading to lunch and ice cream near the base of Mount Fuji. Alkonis was
talking with his daughter, then 7, when his family says he suddenly fell
unconscious behind the wheel. He was so out of it, they say, that
neither his daughter’s screams to wake up nor the impact of the
collision roused him.</p>
<p>After the crash near Fujinomiya, he was arrested by Japanese
authorities and held for 26 days in solitary confinement at a police
detention facility, interrogated multiple times a day and was not given
a medical treatment or evaluation, according to a statement of facts
provided by a family spokesman. That statement says that when American
authorities arrived to take Alkonis into custody and return him to a
U.S. base, he already was held by the Japanese.</p>
<p>He was indicted on a charge of a negligent driving, resulting in
death, and was sentenced to three years in prison.</p>
<p>After the sentencing, Alkonis’ family had sought to keep the case in
the public spotlight, including by gathering outside the White House.
President Joe Biden also raised the case during a meeting last May with
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.</p>
<p>Alkonis is a specialist in underseas warfare and acoustic engineering
who at the time of the crash had spent nearly seven years in Japan as a
civilian volunteer and naval officer.</p>

<p>Yesterday I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021">addressed</a> the
How Do I Write question, now let me address Why I Write. I write at
least partially because I know there are good people who love my
writing. The tech industry, to the extent that they remember me, resents
me. I get that. It’s sad, because I do care, I am one of them, as Diana
was one of the royals (see above). Anyway, I love to write because there
are people who love to read. And I feel connected to them. My mother was
the prototype. We weren’t very close in actual life, but she was a
devoted reader of my blog. It gave us a connection. And I assume all
daily or nightly readers of this blog have that kind of connection,
whether I hear from them or not. And sometimes you do
<a href="https://twitter.com/tanyaweiman/status/1735267625691701440">hear

News)</p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2019/12/24/santa.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I’ve
been re-bingeing the whole
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)">Crown
series</a>, anticipating that there was going to be a new and
<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-crown/season-6/">final
series</a> of episodes, out today. I started watching the new one, and
all of a sudden the two princes, William and Harry, are actual people. I
have a lot of trouble with that, because of course I remember when they
were born. However I’m pretty sure I’ll go all the way through. There
are a lot of hours of entertainment in The Crown and a few scenes that
are truly spectacular
(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBwQICiGRmw">like this</a>). I
remember the really good ones of course, but there’s an awful lot of
<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/schlock">schlock</a>.
One scene I had not remembered was a pretty good illustration of how
fucked up people can be. Princess Diana had just gone on a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqe-SuyAyWI">tour of NYC</a>,
her first international tour on her own, and it was (surprising to her)
a huge success. Another British invasion. The people of NYC loved Diana
(at least in the show, I don’t remember this, I was living in California
at the time). So she comes home, and the royal family, instead of
cheering her, were angry with her for being so charming. Go figure. Her
husband, Prince Charles is yelling at her and he asks her if she ever
considered how
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla">Camilla</a>,
Charles’ one true love, would feel about Diana being so popular. Diana
is <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gobsmacked">gobsmacked</a>
(as am I). Why would she think of that. How totally fucked up is that.
Why should anyone, being themselves, being happy, worry about how anyone
else might feel about their happiness? I’ve been in Diana’s position a
few times, achieving success, much deserved, and was reminded that this
upset people who (apparently) didn’t want me to succeed? I have even
been asked that question. If you ever feel that way, that someone else’s
happiness is meant to make you feel bad, remember Carl Sagan’s
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wupToqz1e2g">Pale Blue Dot</a>
video. Really, <i>no one cares</i> if you are offended by someone else’s
happiness. Remember, none of this stuff amounts to anything in the big
picture. We’re very small, all of us put together, in the grand scheme
of things. So if you’re happy, good for you! And one other question – is
re-bingeing actually a word?? <span style="opacity: 0.6"><span

<li>Massive Tesla recall is a ‘win’ … for Tesla
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>In other EV news, more than 2 million Tesla vehicles
are set to receive over-the-air updates to address failures in the
Autopilot system. As <em>Wired</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a17d5d71a2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notes</a>,
that’s nearly all the vehicles Tesla has sold in the U.S. to date. At
issue is the Autosteer functionality, and the recall follows an
investigation by the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration (HTWSA) into a series of crashes that may have occurred
while Autopilot was in use. The updates will include added safety
controls and alerts, and further limit where drivers can use Autosteer,
<em>Wired</em> says. The recall is a “win” for Tesla,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0e9eece906&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argues</a>
Damon Lavrinc at Heatmap. “U.S. regulators did not conclude the
technology itself was unsafe, and also determined that drivers are
responsible for using Autopilot safely. This is what Tesla has contended
since the beginning, and it’s a rebuke to safety advocates, many local
legislators, and lawyers representing accident victims and their
families.”

Market Report</a> this morning, which says that global oil demand rose
in 2023 but that a slowdown has begun and will continue through 2024.
This, combined with supply growth from the U.S. (and elsewhere), will
“complicate efforts by key producers to defend their market share and
maintain elevated oil prices,” the agency concludes. The report is in
contrast to projections put forward by the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), which this week

it still expects demand for oil to grow next year by 2.25 million

Court Upholds Detention of US Reporter Gershkovich</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — A Moscow court on Thursday upheld a ruling to hold in
detention until January 30 U.S. reporter Evan Gershkovich, arrested in
Russia earlier this year on espionage charges.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old Wall Street Journal correspondent in Moscow, his
employer and the U.S. government have all rejected the spying
allegations.</p>
<p>“Evan Gershkovich will remain in custody until January 30, 2024,” the
Moscow city court said in a statement on social media, turning down an
appeal lodged late last month.</p>
<p>A video released by the court showed Gershkovich, who previously
worked for Agence France-Presse, standing in a cage for defendants
during Thursday’s hearing, smiling and wearing a dark-colored
sweater.</p>
<p>Gershkovich was arrested during a reporting trip at the end of March
in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg, becoming the first Western reporter
to be held on spying charges in Russia since the Soviet era.</p>
<p>He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>Russia this month also brought fresh charges against U.S.-Russian
dual citizen Alsu Kurmasheva, arrested in the central city of Kazan in
October and charged with failing to register as a “foreign agent.”</p>
<p>Her employer, Radio Free Europe/Liberty (RFE/RL), this week denounced
the fresh charges filed against her after reports she has also been
accused of violating rules against Ukraine war criticism.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Now it is over. Early on Wednesday morning, negotiators in Dubai reached
an agreement at the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change, the global meeting otherwise known as
COP28.
</p>
<p>
Their final text for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-5-things" target="_self">the
Global Stocktake</a> — a kind of report card on humanity’s progress on
its Paris Agreement goals — is contradictory and half-hearted. Instead
of blunt language instructing countries to “phase out fossil fuels,” it
instead provides a range of options that could let countries achieve
“deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.” One
of these possibilities is the tripling of global renewable capacity;
another is a call for “transitioning away from fossil fuels.”
</p>
<p>
So far, this language — this call for leaving fossil fuels — has
attracted the most attention by far. Simon Stiell, the UN’s top climate
official,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-5-things" target="_self">said</a>
that it marked “the beginning of the end” of the fossil-fuel era, while
the climate journalist and activist Bill McKibben has argued that the
phrase can become
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/bill-mckibben-cop28-sentence" target="_self">a
useful tool for activists</a>, who can now beat it across the head of
the Biden administration.
</p>
<p>
But a separate phrase in the agreement caught my attention. Immediately
after calling for transitioning away from fossil fuels, the text makes a
different point: that the world must accelerate the development of
“zero- and low-emission technologies, including, <em>inter alia</em>,
renewables, nuclear, abatement and removal technologies such as carbon
capture and utilization and storage, particularly in hard-to-abate
sectors, and low-carbon hydrogen production.”
</p>
<p>
This language may rankle some readers because it seems to give pride of
place to carbon capture and storage technology, or CCS, which would
allow fossil fuel-burning plants to catch emissions before they enter
the atmosphere. (It also seems to conflate CCS with carbon removal
technology, even though they are different.) But I believe that the
overarching demand — the call for accelerating climate-friendly
technologies — represents a crucial insight, one that I could not stop
thinking about at the COP itself, and one that is linked to any
realistic demand to phase out fossil fuels. Here is that insight: The
world will only be able to decarbonize when it develops abundant energy
technologies that emit little carbon and that are price-competitive if
not <em>cheaper </em>than their fossil-fueled alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Just as COP28 began, the Rhodium Group, an energy research firm,
published a new study looking at how carbon pollution will rise and fall
through the end of the century. Unlike other such studies — which ask
either how the planet will fare if no new climate policy passes, or what
the world must do to avoid 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming — this new
study tried to look at what was <em>likely</em> to happen. Given what we
know about how countries’ emissions rise and fall with their economies,
and when and how they tend to pass climate policy, how much warming can
we expect by the end of the century?
</p>
<p>
As the report’s authors put it, the study was aimed not at policymakers,
but at policy takers — the officials, executives, engineers, and local
leaders who are starting to plan for the world of 2100.
</p>
<p>
Here’s the good news: Global greenhouse gas emissions are likely to peak
this decade, the report found. Sometime during the 2020s, humanity’s
emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other climate pollution will
reach an all-time high and begin to fall. (Right now, we emit
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2022/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
the equivalent of 50.6 billion tons</a> of the stuff every year.) This
will represent a world-historic turning point in our species’ effort to
govern the global climate system, and it will probably happen before
Morocco, Portugal, and
Spain<a href="https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/organisation/fifa-council/media-releases/fifa-council-takes-key-decisions-on-fifa-world-cup-tm-editions-in-2030-and-2034" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
host the 2030 World Cup</a>.
</p>
<p>
And that is roughly where the good news ends. Because unlike in rosy
net-zero studies where humanity’s carbon emissions peak and then rapidly
fall to zero, the report does <em>not </em>project any near-term
pollution plunge. Instead, global emissions waver and plateau through
the 2030s and 2040s, falling in some years, rising slightly in others,
cutting an unmistakably downward trend while failing to get anywhere
close to zero. By 2060, annual emissions will have fallen to 39
gigatons, only 22% below today’s levels.
</p>
<p>
And — worse news, now — that is as low as emissions will ever get this
century, the report projects. Driven by explosive economic growth in
Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, global emissions begin to rise —
slowly but inexorably — starting in the 2060s. They keep rising in the
2070s, 2080s, and 2090s. By the year 2090, emissions will have reached
44 gigatons, only 13% below today’s levels and roughly where emissions
stood in 2003.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How Greenhouse Gas Emissions Could Fall — Then Rise — in the
21st Century</strong>

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Rhodium
Group</small>
</p>
<p>
In other words, after a century of work to fight climate change,
humanity will find itself roughly where it began. But now, with several
thousand additional gigatons of emissions in the atmosphere, the planet
will be about 2.8 degrees Celsius warmer (or about 5 degrees
Fahrenheit). At its high end estimate, temperatures could rise as much
as 4 degrees Celsius, or more than 7 degrees Fahrenheit.
</p>
<p>
This temperature rise will be caused by legacy emissions from polluters
like the United States and China, but as the century goes on, it will
increasingly come from Asian and African countries such as Vietnam,
Indonesia, Nigeria, Kenya, and others. Why? It’s not like these
countries, say, reject renewables or electric vehicles: In fact, Rhodium
anticipates that renewables will have grown up to 22-fold by the end of
the century.
</p>
<p>
Instead, emissions rise because fossil fuels are cheap and globally
abundant — they remain one of the easiest ways to power an explosively
growing society — and because of the growth of the so-called
hard-to-abate sectors in these countries are slated to grow just as
quickly as the economies themselves. Indonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam
will demand many megatons of new steel, cement, and chemicals to furnish
their growing societies; right now, the only economical way to make
those materials requires releasing immense amounts of carbon pollution
into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Let’s be clear: Rhodium’s report is a projection, not a prophecy. It
should not provoke despair, I think, but determination. Many of the
so-called hard-to-abate activities, such as steel or petrochemical
making, should more aptly be called
activities-that-we-haven’t-tried-very-hard-to-abate yet; people will
likely find a way to do them by the middle of the century. (When I
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/bill-gates-cop28-green-premium-trump" target="_self">asked
Bill Gates</a> what he thought about the Rhodium Group’s findings, he
replied that predicting the carbon intensity of certain activities in
2060 was all but impossible: We might have safe, cheap, and abundant
nuclear fission by then, or even nuclear fusion.)
</p>
<p>
Yet it heralds a shift in climate geopolitics that, while it has not yet
happened, is not so far away. Since the modern era of global climate
politics began in 1990, most carbon emissions have come from just a
handful of countries: China, the United States, and the 37 other rich,
developed democracies that make up the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, or OECD. These countries have emitted 55%
of climate pollution since 1990, while the rest of the world — the
remaining low- and middle-income countries — have emitted only 45%.
</p>
<p>
But from now to 2100, that relationship is set to reverse. Through the
end of the century, China and the OECD countries emit only 40% of total
global emissions, according to Rhodium’s projections. The rest of the
world, meanwhile, will emit 60% of global emissions.
</p>
<p>
In other words, decarbonization will soon become a challenge for
<em>middle-income</em> countries. These countries will not be able to
spend extra to buy climate-friendly technologies, but they are simply
too populous for rich countries to subsidize. At the same time, these
countries lack an existing fleet of fossil-fuel-consuming equipment, so
they will not need to transition <em>away</em> from fossil fuels in the
first place. Unlike in the United States, where we will have to shut
down our oil-and-gas economy as we build a new one to replace it, Kenya
or Indonesia can more or less build a climate-friendly middle-class
economy <em>de novo, </em>much in the same way that in the 2000s
countries
<a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2008-05-19-voa22/401756.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“leapfrogged”
landline telephones</a> and adopted cell phones. Yet countries will only
be able to leapfrog the fossil-fuel era if the climate equivalent of
cell phones exist: if climate-friendly technologies are plentiful,
useful, and price-competitive.
</p>
<p>
That’s not all it will take, of course. The world will have to phase
down the production and consumption of fossil fuels, because the
existence of climate-friendly technologies will not guarantee their use.
Humanity may also have to create and enforce a strong moral taboo around
burning fossil fuels, much in the same way that it has created a taboo
around, say, child labor. But none of that can happen unless
climate-friendly alternatives exist: Otherwise countries will ensure
that they gain access to the energy that their development requires.

id="us-taiwan-discuss-broadening-taiwans-international-participation">US,
Taiwan Discuss Broadening Taiwan’s International Participation</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — The United States and Taiwan are exploring ways to
expand Taiwan’s participation in the United Nations system and other
international forums, as well as addressing a range of global
challenges, including public health, aviation safety and climate
change.</p>
<p>The most recent routine consultation between the U.S. and Taiwan took
place Wednesday, days after the Chinese delegation at COP28 opposed
calls to include Taiwan in the United Nations climate talks in
Dubai.</p>
<p>All participants in the latest U.S.-Taiwan talks “recognized the
importance of working closely with likeminded partners who share our
concerns regarding attempts to exclude Taiwan from the international
community,” according to the U.S. State Department in a statement.</p>
<p>Taiwan Relations Act</p>
<p>Senior American officials have said Washington’s “One China” policy
is “distinct” from Beijing’s “One China” principle. The U.S. policy is
guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques and the
Six Assurances. China has objected to the Taiwan Relations Act and
deemed it as invalid.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Relations Act has stated that “nothing in this Act may be
construed as a basis for supporting the exclusion or expulsion of Taiwan
from continued membership in any international financial institution or
any other international organization.”</p>
<p>The Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan but claims
sovereignty over the island, which became home to the Chinese
Nationalist government after its defeat in 1949. During the U.N. climate
talks held in the United Arab Emirates, Chinese officials lodged a
protest after calls to include Taiwan’s participation in the climate
summit by other countries.</p>
<p>“China has noted that during the meeting a handful of countries
ignore the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and make
noises about the participation by the Taiwan authorities in the COP,” a
member of the Chinese delegation said via a translator in the plenary
hall in Dubai.</p>
<p>Wednesday, officials from the State Department and Taiwan’s Ministry
of Foreign Affairs discussed near-term opportunities to support Taiwan’s
participation in the World Health Assembly (WHA) and other global public
health bodies, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as
well as Taiwan’s meaningful participation in other multilateral
organizations.</p>
<p>World Health Organization and International Civil Aviation
Organization</p>
<p>The Beijing government has been blocking Taiwan’s representation at
WHA meetings after the self-ruled democracy elected Tsai Ing-wen, a
China skeptic, as president in 2016.</p>
<p>China has also blocked Taiwan’s participation in ICAO assemblies
since 2013.</p>
<p>Since the U.S. switched its diplomatic recognition from the
government of Taipei to Beijing in 1979, Washington has insisted that
the two sides should resolve their political disputes peacefully.</p>
<p>Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said “fundamental
differences” over Taiwan persist in Washington’s relationship with
Beijing.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat on China said the United States will continue
to implement the Taiwan Relations Act and help Taiwan with its defense
needs, renewing the U.S. commitment to maintain peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>In recent months, China has been increasing its military activities
near the strait.  The United States has voiced concerns about any
Chinese interference through military coercion, as Taiwan prepares for a
presidential election in January 2024.</p>
<p>“I think what we can do is to insist that the people in Taiwan have
an opportunity to vote freely on January 13,” Burns told an audience
during a seminar hosted by the U.S.-based Council on Foreign
Relations.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials said the election in Taiwan “is purely
China’s internal affair.”</p>
<p>“Taiwan independence” means war and “Taiwan independence” is a dead
end, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said during a
recent briefing.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with VOA, U.S. Senior Official for Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation Matt Murray said, “We certainly want to make sure
there are opportunities for engagement” between the U.S. and Taiwan in
international economic forums, as Taiwan is one of the top trading
partners and investors in the United States.</p>
<p>Morris Chang, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company,
represented Taiwan during the APEC summit in San Francisco in
mid-November, where he held talks with U.S. Vice President Kamala
Harris.</p>
<p>The two discussed the U.S.-Taiwan “relationship on the economy and
technology,” Harris said in a social media post on X, formerly Twitter.
Chang also had a pull-aside meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony
Blinken during the APEC meetings, according to Murray.</p>
<p>The last U.S.-Taiwan working group meeting on international
organizations took place in April.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>A recent discovery that overclocking AMD’s latest chips blows a fuse
to denote the chip has been overclocked has led to slightly misleading
claims that it will automatically void the chips’ warranty for any type
of failure. However, AMD clarified to Tom’s Hardware that overclocking
AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7000 (Storm Peak) and non-Pro lineup, among
the best workstation CPUs, doesn’t automatically void the processor’s
warranty. ↫ Zhiye Liu at Tom’s Hardware Something about these fuses in
processors doesn’t sit right with me.</p>

CPU</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’re going to cover the Cortex A57 as implemented in the Nintendo
Switch’s Nvidia Tegra X1. The Tegra X1 targets a wide range of
applications including mobile devices and automobiles. It focuses on
providing high GPU performance in a limited power envelope, making it
perfect for a portable gaming console like the Switch. Tegra X1 consumes
117,6 mm2 on TSMC’s 20 nm (20 SoC) process and uses a quad core A57
cluster to provide the bulk of its CPU power. Each Cortex A57 core
consumes just under 2 mm2 of area, and the quad core A57 cluster takes
13.16 mm2. ↫ Clamchowder at Chips and Cheese An old SoC still doing
excellent work in the Switch.</p>

<h2 id="frame-pointers-enabled-by-default-in-ubuntu-24.04-lts">Frame
pointers enabled by default in Ubuntu 24.04 LTS</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>In collaboration with Polar Signals we have committed that beginning
with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, our GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) package will
enable frame pointers by default for 64-bit platforms. All packages in
Ubuntu, with very few exceptions, will be rebuilt with frame pointers
enabled, making them easier to profile and subsequently optimise. “I’ve
enabled frame pointers at huge scale for Java and glibc and studied the
CPU overhead for this change, which is typically less than 1% and
usually so close to zero that it is hard to measure. Frame pointers
allow more complete CPU profiling and off-CPU profiling. The performance
wins that these can provide far outweigh the comparatively tiny loss in
performance. Ubuntu enabling frame pointers by default will be a huge
win for performance engineering and the default developer experience”.
said Brendan Gregg, computer performance expert and Intel Fellow. ↫
Oliver Smith on the official Ubuntu blog So I guess the very minor
performance regression is supposed to be compensated for by
optimisations in individual packages that frame pointers will help
realise.</p>

<h2 id="the-tesla-recall-is-a-win-for-tesla">The Tesla Recall Is a Win
for Tesla</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc4NDg3NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjUzNDc3M30.8KjfVQecuJXRF3RlCZccdFTvRYowFmqM9nxBx8cqzao/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
More than 2 million Tesla vehicles are set to receive over-the-air
updates to address failures in the Autopilot system, the carmaker’s
much-hyped and oft-abused driver-assistance program. But the recall
report published by the National Highway Transportation Safety
Administration shows regulators are willing to keep risky technology on
the road as long as the driver gets nagged enough.
</p>
<p>
What’s at issue with the recall is less Autopilot’s ability to brake and
accelerate and more its Autosteer functionality, which allows the car to
follow curves and make turns.
<a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V838-8276.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According
to NHTSA</a>, “the prominence and scope of the feature’s controls may
not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse.”
</p>
<p>
That “misuse” has been well documented in the years since Autopilot’s
release. It began with Teslas being
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUAkEqh0pcU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“hacked”
with a water bottle</a> to allow drivers to keep their hands completely
off the wheel (and sometimes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOV-5E81fuI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">their
bodies in the back seat</a>); after that, researchers found that
Autopiloted Teslas were involved in
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/teslas-using-autopilot-crashed-273-times-in-less-than-a-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">273
crashes</a> over a one-year period. Autopilot has been investigated in
<a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">almost
a dozen cases</a> of vehicles crashing into emergency vehicles, and just
this August, thousands of
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/21/tesla-breach-employee-insider/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Autopilot
complaints from German customers</a> were leaked to
<em>Handelsblatt</em>, a German business newspaper.
</p>
<p>
The initial NHTSA investigation began in 2021, and late this year U.S.
regulators met with Tesla twice to address fixes. The automaker
eventually decided to resolve the matter by voluntarily administering
the recall — while, according to NHTSA, “not concurring with the
agency’s analysis.”
</p>
<p>
While a 2 million-car recall isn’t something usually construed as a win,
in this case, U.S. regulators did not conclude the technology itself was
unsafe, and also determined that drivers are responsible for using
Autopilot safely. This is what Tesla has contended since the beginning,
and it’s a rebuke to safety advocates, many local legislators, and
lawyers representing accident victims and their families.
</p>
<p>
Both Tesla and NHTSA point out that Autopilot is similar to other Level
2 automated driving systems offered by competing automakers — although
these competitors have more cautiously waded into autonomy, building in
myriad restrictions and ways to track driver focus. That’s in contrast
to Tesla, which, despite ample contravening evidence and multiple
lawsuits, still hosts a
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/videos/autopilot-self-driving-hardware-neighborhood-long" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">video</a>
of a Model X “self-driving” with no intervention from the passenger on
its website.

<h2 id="bidens-one-tax-credit-to-rule-them-all">Biden’s One Tax Credit
to Rule Them All</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
This year may forever be remembered as the start of the American clean
energy manufacturing boom.
</p>
<p>
Since the beginning of 2023, companies have announced more than 150
separate investments in new and expanded factories to manufacture solar
panels, wind turbines, batteries, and other clean energy technologies in
the U.S., for a total pledged outlay of nearly $60 billion, according to
<a href="https://e2.org/announcements/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tracking
by the nonpartisan group E2</a>. And these factories won’t just be
assembling the final products. Entire supply chains have arrived on
shore.
</p>
<p>
This is all, of course, due to the Inflation Reduction Act, the historic
climate legislation President Biden signed in 2022. The projects
announced this year are on top of some 60 announcements made right after
the law passed.
</p>
<p>
But more specifically, these factories are the result of one program in
the law that has perhaps not been fully appreciated — the 45X tax
credit. The IRA’s X-factor, if I may.
</p>
<p>
In ecology, scientists refer to animals that have a disproportionate
effect on their ecosystem as “keystone species.” Beavers, for example,
engineer the landscape around them, creating habitat that allows certain
other plants and animals to thrive. If beavers suddenly disappeared,
those habitats and the creatures they supported would vanish, too.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, 45X is the “keystone” of the IRA, according to Harry Godfrey,
managing director at Advanced Energy United, an industry association
that represents a variety of clean energy companies. This one provision
engineers the ecosystems supporting three key technologies — wind,
solar, and batteries — by offering tax relief to U.S. manufacturers
producing components up and down their supply chains.
</p>
<p>
The goal is not just to lower the cost of these climate solutions, but
also to level the global playing field for American-made goods. Before
the end of the year the Treasury Department will propose new guidance on
how the 45X tax credit will work — for example, how the government will
prevent fraud and abuse of the program — but the basic mechanics
established in the IRA have given companies enough confidence to get to
work.
</p>
<p>
The size of the credit companies are eligible for is
<a href="https://business.edf.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/90/files/45X-Production-Credit-Amounts-By-Component-Types.svg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specific
to each manufactured component</a>. Let’s look at how solar panels are
made, as an example:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1.</strong> At the top of the supply chain are the companies
that make polysilicon, the key material that helps transform sunlight
into electricity. Those producers will earn $3 per kilogram of
polysilicon fabricated in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2.</strong> Next are the companies that buy polysilicon and turn
it into solar wafers, thin slices that are later stacked to produce
solar cells. They will receive $12 per square meter of wafer they
produce.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3.</strong> The solar cell fabricators will receive a refund
based on how much electricity their cells are capable of producing, paid
out at 4 cents per watt, or $40 per kilowatt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.</strong> Producers of “polymeric backsheets,” a protective
layer applied to the back of the final solar panels, can earn 40 cents
per square meter.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5.</strong> Finally, companies that assemble the cells into a
solar panel and apply the backsheets will get $70 per kilowatt.
</p>
<p>
Advanced Energy United made a
<a href="https://info.aee.net/hubfs/2023%20Reports/Unleashing%20America%E2%80%99s%20Advanced%20Energy%20Future%20Lawmakers.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rough
estimate</a> of what those five incentives would mean for solar using
2018 manufacturing data. It found that 45X would reduce the cost of a
domestically produced solar panel by 41%. “That’s huge to the global
competitiveness of this industry,” said Godfrey.
</p>
<p>
There are additional incentives under 45X not even included in their
analysis. The program pays back 10% of the cost of producing the
aluminum that goes into the solar panel’s frame and into the inverter
that enables it to send power onto the electric grid, for example.
Producers of “torque tubes” and “fasteners,” the structural components
used to mount solar panels to a field or roof, are also eligible.
Inverter manufacturers qualify, as well.
</p>
<p>
There’s no per-company cap or annual funding limit on the tax credit,
and it will be in effect until 2032. But if it succeeds, it could become
self-sustaining, encouraging companies to come to the U.S. in the future
because that’s where the supply chain and workforce is. “Suddenly you’re
shifting the gravity back into the United States,” Godfrey told me.
</p>
<p>
Proponents of subsidizing a domestic clean energy manufacturing industry
tout benefits like job creation, economic development, and improving
U.S. energy security and independence. Renewable energy technologies
like wind and solar already inherently do this, as they reduce our
exposure to the price volatility of oil and gas, as when energy prices
spiked around the world in 2022 due to Russia’s war in Ukraine.
</p>
<p>
Diversifying supply chains and bringing them to the U.S. further
insulates the country from being overly dependent on China, which
currently controls some 60% of the manufacturing capacity of clean
energy technologies. Being so reliant on <em>any</em> one country is
risky — and when that country is China, a country with which the U.S.
has a longstanding rivalry, the risk is greater still. For instance,
China recently
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/graphite-batteries-trade-war-us-china" target="_self">restricted
exports of graphite</a>, a key mineral for electric vehicles, in
retaliation to U.S. export limits on semiconductors.
</p>
<p>
45X is not the only program in the IRA that encourages domestic
production. The consumer
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_self">tax
credit for electric vehicles</a>, for example, which gives car buyers a
$7,500 discount on a new EV, only applies to models that were assembled
in the U.S., with at least 50% of their battery components made in the
country, too. But the IRA creates a push and pull dynamic — 45X provides
the push for that consumer-based pull to work.
</p>
<p>
“In order for these demand side credits to be effective, we need the
manufacturing capacity,” Thomas Boylan, regulatory director at the Zero
Emissions Transportation Association told me. “Broadly speaking, this is
what will make or break the success of some of these other credits.”
</p>
<p>
Treasury’s upcoming guidance will help clarify exactly which processes
and technologies qualify. But unlike some of the IRA’s other programs,
where the department has had to contend with big, industry-shaping
questions, like how a company can
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self">prove
it is using clean electricity</a>, the uncertainty around 45X is mostly
around small details.
</p>
<p>
For example, Boylan told me there’s some confusion in the industry about
who can claim which aspect of the credit. Can producers of critical
minerals claim 45X, or is the credit just for companies who buy the
minerals? And if one company is involved in multiple steps of the supply
chain, can they claim 45X for each one? There’s also uncertainty about
whether only producers of new materials are eligible, or whether, for
example, an electric vehicle battery recycling company can claim the
credit.
</p>
<p>
But as evidenced by the investment numbers, companies haven’t exactly
been waiting for the guidance to make moves.

<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc4NzMyMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MTYwMjQwMn0.IQsNygH9eNynTodIYN_6yMNbhcdS3lFtiX-6kQM-_o0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As North America slept, delegates from around the world concluded the
global climate conference in Dubai, when the chair — local oilman Sultan
al-Jaber — quick-gaveled through an agreement that included a sentence
calling for “transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in
a just, orderly and equitable manner.”
</p>
<p>
That may not seem like much — it is, after all, the single most obvious
thing one could possibly say about climate change, akin to “in an effort
to reduce my headache, I am transitioning away from hitting myself in
the forehead with a hammer.” And by itself it will accomplish nothing.
As Samoa, speaking on behalf of the Small Island Nations, said a few
minutes later, “we have come to the conclusion that the course
correction that is needed has not been secured.”
</p>
<p>
But it is — and this is important — a tool for activists to use
henceforth. The world’s nations have now publicly agreed that they need
to transition off fossil fuels, and that sentence will hang over every
discussion from now on — especially the discussions about any further
<em>expansion </em>of the fossil fuel energy. There may be barriers to
shutting down operations (what the text of the agreement obliquely
refers to as “national circumstances, pathways and approaches”). But
surely, if the language means anything at all, it means opening no more
<em>new</em> oil fields, no more <em>new </em>pipeline. No more
<em>new</em> LNG export terminals.
</p>
<p>
In fact, that last point — export terminals for liquefied natural gas —
will almost certainly be the first real test of whether this agreement
means anything. The American envoy John Kerry, who celebrated his 80th
birthday during the talks, could be forgiven for thinking of it as a
crowning achievement. Though he acknowledged stronger language would
have been nice, “I think everybody here should be pleased that in a
world of Ukraine and the Middle East war and all the other challenges of
a planet that is foundering, this is a moment where multilateralism has
actually come together and people have taken individual interests and
attempted to define the common good,” Kerry said. “That is hard. That is
the hardest thing in diplomacy, the hardest thing in politics.”
</p>
<p>
But Kerry’s job isn’t done. He needs to return home and convince the
White House to pause the granting of new export licenses for the ongoing
LNG buildout, a project so enormous that by itself it could produce more
greenhouse gas emissions than all of Europe. If the White House agrees —
and Dubai saw the release of a
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uuGszOOFABFWEmcQrZugDCf7KS2omxebXePjFhJ8Zxc/edit" target="_blank">letter</a>
from 230 environmental organizations urging just such a pause — then we
will know there was something real in all this endless talk.
</p>
<p>
And in that case, the bland sentence — “transitioning away from fossil
fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner”
<strong>— </strong>would join at least two others in the long history of
the climate talks as historically significant.
</p>
<p>
The first came in 1995, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, in its second assessment report, said “the balance of evidence
suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.”
That bland sentence — bland for the same reason, because it also had to
get past every government in the world — was the death knell for the
argument that climate change wasn’t real; after it, no serious person
(admittedly a category with many exceptions) could argue there was no
need to do anything.
</p>
<p>
The second came in 2015, in the preamble to the Paris accords, when (at
the urging of those same small island states) the text included a pledge
to “substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to hold global
temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius above
pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C
above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly
reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.” That recognition of 1.5
degrees changed the debate — but only because activists and scientists
used it to demand that governments and businesses identify a “1.5 degree
path,” which increased the seriousness of those plans. We’re not going
to stay below 1.5 degrees — but that sentence may, in the end, knock
half a degree off how much the planet warms.
</p>
<p>
If today’s sentence is to matter, it will need that same kind of
activism, especially since the fossil fuel industry — the most
well-represented ‘nation’ at the talks — managed to lard the text with
wiggle words. For instance, the agreement “recognizes that transitional
fuels can play a role in facilitating the energy transition while
ensuring energy security,” which the fracked gas industry is going to
interpret as permission for them to go on pumping. We need to insist
that the clear, plain meaning of the language is, the fossil fuel era is
over. No more new digging and drilling.
</p>
<p>
What I’m trying to say is, today’s agreement is literally meaningless —
and potentially meaningful. But the diplomats are done now — the rest of
us are going to have to supply that meaning.

id="pakistans-ex-leader-indicted-over-revealing-us-tied-state-secrets">Pakistan’s
Ex-Leader Indicted Over Revealing US-Tied State Secrets</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ISLAMABAD — A special Pakistani court Wednesday indicted former Prime
Minister Imran Khan on unprecedented and disputed charges of disclosing
classified information involving the United States while in office.</p>
<p>The indictment has dealt a fresh blow to the incarcerated popular
leader’s chances of contesting national elections in February and
returning to power.</p>
<p>Co-defendant Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Khan’s deputy and a former foreign
minister, was also indicted for his alleged role in the case. Foreign
media representatives were not allowed to cover the legal proceedings,
while only a handful of local journalists were given access as
usual.</p>
<p>“The charges were read out loudly in the courtroom,” government
prosecutor Shah Khawar told Reuters, saying Khan and Qureshi both
pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Khan’s lawyer, barrister Gohar Khan, disputed the indictment. He told
reporters after the hearing that “no charge was framed before us nor
signed by the accused.” The trial was being conducted “hastily without
ensuring transparency and fairness,” the lawyer alleged.</p>
<p>“Again, justice is being rushed, and whenever it is rushed, it is
always crushed,” he added. The defense attorney lamented the trial could
not be conducted openly and said most foreign and local media reporters
were barred from covering the proceedings in violation of a judicial
order.</p>
<p>“The criminal justice system of Pakistan is being used as a tool for
political victimization. We have had enough of it. This must stop,” he
said.</p>
<p>The court initially indicted Khan and Qureshi in October on the same
charges in closed-door proceedings, but a higher court scrapped the
process and ordered authorities to ensure an open trial and allow family
members and journalists to attend it.</p>
<p>The judicial proceedings are underway inside a prison facility near
the capital, Islamabad, for security reasons, the government says.</p>
<p>Legal experts say that a guilty verdict could result in a maximum
sentence of 14 years imprisonment or a death sentence.</p>
<p>The lawsuit stems from a classified cable, internally known as a
cipher, sent to Islamabad by Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington in
March 2022.</p>
<p>Khan alleged the cipher documented the United States’ role in the
toppling of his government a month later with the help of his country’s
powerful military to punish him for visiting Moscow a day before Russia
invaded Ukraine.</p>
<p>Both Washington and the Pakistan military deny the charges.</p>
<p>On Monday, the State Department spokesman again refuted allegations
the U.S. had anything to do with Pakistan’s internal affairs.</p>
<p>“The United States does not play any role in choosing the leaders of
Pakistan. We engage with the leadership shown by — or the leadership
decided by the Pakistani people — and we will continue to engage with
the government of Pakistan on all these issues,” Matthew Miller told a
news conference in Washington.</p>
<p>Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party won the last general
elections in 2018, making him the prime minister for the first time.</p>
<p>The charismatic cricketer-turned-politician discussed details of the
cipher at party rallies and during media interviews in the run-up to the
controversial vote and continued doing so after his ouster.</p>
<p>Khan maintains he was doing so lawfully because he was duty-bound to
inform Pakistanis about “the foreign conspiracy” against the government
they had elected.</p>
<p>Since his removal from power, the ousted prime minister has faced
dozens of lawsuits filed by authorities, which he claims to be a ploy by
the military to prevent his comeback to power because of his advocacy
for an independent foreign policy for Pakistan, one free from the
influence of the United States.</p>
<p>Last August, Khan was convicted in a graft case and sentenced to
three years in jail. A superior court later suspended his sentence and
ordered the government to release him on bail, but authorities refused,
citing the cipher and other lawsuits against him.</p>
<p>Unless his conviction is overturned, the former prime minister
remains disqualified from running in the upcoming elections or leading
the PTI under election laws.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed
controversial military tribunals to resume trials of more than 100 Imran
Khan supporters on charges of attacking army properties during
anti-government protests last May.</p>
<p>The judicial order came less than two months after a five-judge panel
of the top court ruled against trying civilians in military courts. Khan
and his party maintain the military trials of political activists are a
violation of the constitution and are meant to scare their candidates
away from the upcoming polls.</p>
<p>The military has staged three coups against elected prime ministers
since Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947, and it ruled
the country for more than three decades.</p>
<p>Pakistani politicians, including former prime ministers, say the
unconstitutional military interventions have encouraged generals to
influence policymaking significantly, even when not in power.</p>

<h2 id="biden-congress-mulling-big-changes-on-immigration">Biden,
Congress Mulling Big Changes on Immigration</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden is taking a more active role in
Senate negotiations over changes to the immigration system that
Republicans are demanding in exchange for providing money to Ukraine in
its fight against Russia and Israel for the war with Hamas.</p>
<p>The Democratic president has said he is willing to make “significant
compromises on the border” as Republicans block the wartime aid in
Congress. The White House is expected to get more involved in talks this
week as the impasse over changes to border policy has deepened and the
funds remaining for Ukraine have dwindled.</p>
<p>“It’s time to cut a deal that both sides can agree to,” Biden’s
budget director, Shalanda Young, said Sunday on CBS’ “Face the
Nation.”</p>
<p>Republicans say the record numbers of migrants crossing the southern
border pose a security threat because authorities cannot adequately
screen all the migrants and that those who enter the United States are
straining the country’s resources. GOP lawmakers also say they cannot
justify to their constituents sending billions of dollars to other
countries, even in a time of war, while failing to address the border at
home.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, who is leading the
negotiations, pointed to the surge of people entering the U.S. from
Mexico and said “it is literally spiraling out of control.”</p>
<p>“All we’re trying to do is to say what tools are needed to be able to
get this back in control, so we don’t have the chaos on our southern
border,” Lankford said on CBS.</p>
<p>But many immigration advocates, including some Democrats, say some of
the changes being proposed would gut protections for people who
desperately need help and would not really ease the chaos at the
border.</p>
<p>Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democratic bargainer, said the
White House would take a more active role in the talks. But he also
panned Republican policy demands so far as “unreasonable.”</p>
<p>“We don’t want to shut off the United States of America to people who
are coming here to be rescued from dangerous, miserable circumstances,
in which their life is in jeopardy. The best of America is that you can
come here to be rescued from terror and torture,” Murphy said on NBC’s
“Meet the Press.”</p>
<p>Much of the negotiating is taking place in private, but some of the
issues under discussion are known: asylum standards, humanitarian parole
and fast-track deportation authority, among others.</p>
<p>A look at what they are and what might happen if there are
changes:</p>
<p>Humanitarian parole</p>
<p>Using humanitarian parole, the U.S. government can let people into
the country by essentially bypassing the regular immigration process.
This power is supposed to be used on a case-by-case basis for “urgent
humanitarian reasons” or “significant public benefit.” Migrants are
usually admitted for a pre-determined period and there’s no path toward
U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>Over the years, administrations, both Democratic and Republican, have
used humanitarian parole to admit people into the U.S. and help groups
of people from all over the world. It’s been used to admit people from
Hungary in the 1950s, from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos during the latter
half of the 1970s, and Iraqi Kurds who had worked with the U.S. in the
mid-1990s, according to research by the Cato Institute.</p>
<p>Under Biden, the U.S. has relied heavily on humanitarian parole. The
U.S. airlifted nearly 80,000 Afghans from Kabul, the capital of
Afghanistan, and brought them to the U.S. after the Taliban takeover.
The U.S. has admitted tens of thousands of Ukrainians who fled after the
Russian invasion.</p>
<p>In January the Democratic administration announced a plan to admit
30,000 people a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela via
humanitarian parole, provided those migrants had a financial sponsor and
flew to the U.S. instead of going to the U.S.-Mexico border for
entry.</p>
<p>The latest U.S. government figures show that nearly 270,000 people
had been admitted into the country through October under that program.
Separately, 324,000 people have gotten appointments through a mobile app
called CBP One that is used to grant parole to people at land crossings
with Mexico.</p>
<p>Republicans have described the programs as essentially an end run
around Congress by letting in large numbers of people who otherwise
would have no path to be admitted. Texas sued the administration to stop
the program aimed at Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.</p>
<p>What might change with asylum?</p>
<p>Asylum is a type of protection that allows a migrant to stay in the
U..S. and have a path to American citizenship. To qualify for asylum,
someone has to demonstrate fear of persecution back home due to a fairly
specific set of criteria: race, religion, nationality, membership in a
particular social group or political opinions. Asylum-seekers must be on
U.S. soil when they ask for this protection.</p>
<p>They generally go through an initial screening called a credible fear
interview. If they are determined to have a chance of getting asylum,
they are allowed to stay in the U.S. to pursue their case in immigration
court. That process can take years. In the meantime, asylum-seekers can
start to work, get married, have children and create a life.</p>
<p>Critics say the problem is that most people do not end up getting
asylum when their case finally makes it to immigration court. But they
say migrants know that if they claim asylum, they essentially will be
allowed to stay in America for years.</p>
<p>“People aren’t necessarily coming to apply for asylum as much to
access that asylum adjudication process,” said Andrew Arthur, a former
immigration court judge and fellow at the Center for Immigration
Studies, which advocates for less immigration in the U.S.</p>
<p>Some of what lawmakers are discussing would raise the bar that
migrants need to meet during that initial credible fear interview. Those
who do not meet it would be sent home.</p>
<p>But Paul Schmidt, a retired immigration court judge who blogs about
immigration court issues, said the credible fear interview was never
intended to be so tough. Migrants are doing the interview soon after
arriving at the border from an often arduous and traumatizing journey,
he said. Schmidt said the interview is more of an “initial screening” to
weed out those with frivolous asylum claims.</p>
<p>Schmidt also questioned the argument that most migrants fail their
final asylum screening. He said some immigration judges apply overly
restrictive standards and that the system is so backlogged that it is
hard to know exactly what the most recent and reliable statistics
are.</p>
<p>What is expedited removal?</p>
<p>Expedited removal, created in 1996 by Congress, basically allows
low-level immigration officers, as opposed to an immigration judge, to
quickly deport certain immigrants. It was not widely used until 2004 and
generally has been used to deport people apprehended within 100 miles of
the Mexican or Canadian border and within two weeks of their
arrival.</p>
<p>Defenders say it relieves the burden on the backlogged immigration
courts. Immigration advocates say its use is prone to errors and does
not give migrants enough protections, such as having a lawyer help them
argue their case. As president, Republican Donald Trump pushed to expand
this fast-track deportation policy nationwide and for longer periods of
time. Opponents sued and that expansion never happened.</p>
<p>What might these changes do?</p>
<p>Much of the disagreement over these proposed changes comes down to
whether people think deterrence works.</p>
<p>Arthur, the former immigration court judge, thinks it does. He said
changes to the credible fear asylum standards and restrictions on the
use of humanitarian parole would be a “game changer.” He said it would
be a “costly endeavor” as the government would have to detain and deport
many more migrants than today. But, he argued, eventually the numbers of
people arriving would drop.</p>
<p>But others, like Schmidt, the retired immigration court judge, say
migrants are so desperate, they will come anyway and make dangerous
journeys to evade Border Patrol.</p>
<p>“Desperate people do desperate things,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="california-is-headed-for-another-wet-winter">California Is
Headed for Another Wet Winter</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc2MjQzMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMDY1NTc1MX0.BEq5gSMxe8KS-iQuzOo6XfyuYN7JBG6m-m4n7hkfpBM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The 2020s got off to a parched, smoky start in the West. But after three
years of unrelenting drought, 2023 brought the region some relief.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to a very snowy winter followed by a very rainy spring, the worst
of the Western drought receded rapidly in the early months of this year,
data from the
<a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/TimeSeries.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">U.S.
Drought Monitor</a> shows. The extent bottomed out in the early summer,
when only one-sixth of the West was experiencing any level of drought at
all. It’s crept upward since then to about 45% of the region, but still
— that’s the lowest drought level the contiguous Western states have
seen at this time of year since 2019.
</p>
<p>
Most remarkable, in some ways, has been California’s transformation.
After years with far too little precipitation, in 2023 California often
received far too much. A spate of
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/13/us/california-storm-atmospheric-river.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">atmospheric
rivers</a> early in the year dumped inches of rain on its lower
elevations and feet of snow in its mountains. In April, Hurricane Hilary
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-21/hurricane-hilary-obliterated-daily-rainfall-records-across-souther-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">smashed
rainfall records</a> across the southern part of the state.
</p>
<p>
Two years ago this week, 100% of California was drought-stricken; early
this fall, the last patches disappeared (though a small but declining
percentage of the state is still considered “abnormally dry”). This is
the first time drought has been absent from California since 2019. The
most recent time before that was 2011. Before that, it was 2006.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the uptick in Western drought since summer has been most
severe in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/arizona-electricity-public-service-salt-river" target="_self">Arizona</a>
and New Mexico, where the vast majority of places are drier than usual
and conditions in some areas are becoming more severe. Temperatures in
Phoenix rose
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/heat-waves-2023?rebelltitem=22#rebelltitem22" target="_self">above
110 degrees Fahrenheit</a> on a record 55 different days between June
and September, including an historic 31-day streak that baked the city
for almost all of July, the
<a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona-weather/2023/09/22/extreme-heat-brought-record-breaking-summer-to-arizona/70931723007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Arizona
Republic</em> reported</a>. While the wet winter replenished some of the
Colorado River’s dwindling water supply, the temporary boost wasn’t
enough to avert imminent cutbacks among the Southwestern states that
depend on it.
</p>
<p>
This precipitation rebound won’t last, of course. The above-average
mountain snowpack that piled up from heavy winter snows and kept streams
flowing through the spring and into the summer is long gone now. And the
decline this year in infernos terrorizing the West is almost certainly a
blip in the trend toward ever more devastating fire years,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/12/08/wildfire-trends-pause-future-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
Washington Post</em> reported</a> last week. If historic patterns hold
true, there might not be another fire season this quiet for decades.
</p>
<p>
“We have just had a respite,” Tonya Graham, the mayor of Ashland, Ore.,
told the <em>Post</em>. “We have had a little bit of breathing space in
this trajectory that is taking us toward higher wildfire and smoke risk
and more extreme temperatures.”
</p>
<p>
But that rest doesn’t look to be over for everyone just yet. Snowpack is
already starting to accumulate again. And the National Weather Service
<a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/long_range/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forecasts</a>
that at least in California and neighboring states, there’s a good
chance precipitation will stay higher than normal through the winter.

<h2 id="pluralistic-housing-is-a-labor-issue-13-dec-2023">Pluralistic:
Housing is a labor issue (13 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Housing is a labor issue: The eternal labor September
bodes well for the American housing crisis. Hey look at this: Delights
to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2015, 2018, 2022
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading Housing is a labor issue (permalink)
There’s a reason Reagan declared war on unions before he declared war on
everything else – environmental protection, health care, consumer
rights, financial regulation. Unions are how working people fight for a
better world for all of us. They’re how everyday people come together to
resist oligarchy, extraction and exploitation. Take the 2019 LA
teachers’ strike. As Jane McAlevey writes in A Collective Bargain, the
LA teachers didn’t just win higher pay for their members! They also
demanded (and got) an end to immigration sweeps of parents waiting for
their kids at the school gate; a guarantee of green space near every
public school in the city; and on-site immigration counselors in LA
schools: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/23/a-collective-bargain/
Unionization is enjoying an historic renaissance. The Hot Labor Summer
transitioned to an Eternal Labor September, and it’s still going strong,
with UAW president Shawn Fain celebrating his members victory over the
Big Three automakers by calling for a 2028 general strike:
https://www.teenvogue.com/story/uaw-general-strike-no-class The rising
labor movement has powerful allies in the Biden Administration. NLRB
general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo is systematically gutting the “union
avoidance” playbook. She’s banned the use of temp-work app blacklists
that force workers to cross picket lines:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/30/computer-says-scab/#instawork She’s
changed the penalty for bosses who violate labor law during union
drives. It used to be the boss would pay a fine, which was an easy price
to pay in exchange for killing your workers’ union. Now, the penalty is
automatic recognition of the union:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/06/goons-ginks-and-company-finks/#if-blood-be-the-price-of-your-cursed-wealth
And while the law doesn’t allow Abruzzo to impose a contract on
companies that refuse to bargain their unions, she’s set to force those
companies to honor other employers’ union contracts until they agree to
a contract with their own workers:
https://onlabor.org/gc-abruzzo-just-asked-the-nlrb-to-overturn-ex-cell-o-heres-why-that-matters/
She’s also nuking TRAPs, the deals that force workers to repay their
employers for their “training expenses” if they have the audacity to
quit and get a better job somewhere else:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/14/prop-22-never-again/#norms-code-laws-markets
(As with every aspect of the Biden White House, its labor policy is
contradictory and self-defeating, with other Biden appointees working to
smash worker power, including when Biden broke the railworkers’ strike:)
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/18/co-determination/#now-make-me-do-it A
surging labor movement opens up all kinds of possibilities for a better
world. Writing for the Law and Political Economy Project, UNITE Here
attorney Zoe Tucker makes the case for unions as a way out of America’s
brutal housing crisis:
https://lpeproject.org/blog/why-unions-should-join-the-housing-fight/
She describes how low-waged LA hotel workers have been pushed out of
neighborhoods close to their jobs, with UNITE Here members commuting
three hours in each direction, starting their work-days at 3AM in order
to clock in on time:
https://twitter.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1669088899769987079 UNITE Here
members are striking against 50 hotels in LA and Orange County, and
their demands include significant cost-of-living raises. But more money
won’t give them back the time they give up to those bruising daily
commutes. For that, unions need to make housing itself a demand. As
Tucker writes, most workers are tenants and vice-versa. What’s more, bad
landlords are apt to be bad bosses, too. Stepan Kazaryan, the same guy
who owns the strip club whose conditions were so bad that it prompted
the creation of Equity Strippers NoHo, the first strippers’ union in a
generation, is also a shitty landlord whose tenants went on a
rent-strike:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/20/the-missing-links/#plunderphonics So
it was only natural that Kazaryan’s tenants walked the picket line with
the Equity Stripper Noho workers:
https://twitter.com/glendaletenants/status/1733290276599570736?s=46
While scumbag bosses/evil landlords like Kazaryan deal out misery
retail, one apartment building at a time, the wholesale destruction of
workers’ lives comes from private equity giants who are the most
prolific source of TRAPs, robo-scabbing apps, illegal union busting, and
indefinite contract delays – and these are the very same PE firms that
are buying up millions of single-family homes and turning them into
slums:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/08/wall-street-landlords/#the-new-slumlords
Tucker’s point is that when a worker clocks out of their bad job,
commutes home for three hours, and gets back to their
black-mold-saturated, overpriced apartment to find a notice of a new
junk fee (like a surcharge for paying your rent in cash, by check, or by
direct payment), they’re fighting the very same corporations. Unions who
defend their workers’ right to shelter do every tenant a service. A
coalition of LA unions succeeded in passing Measure ULA, which uses a
surcharge on real estate transactions over $5m to fund “the largest
municipal housing program in the country”:
https://unitedtohousela.com/app/uploads/2022/05/LA_City_Affordable_Housing_Petition_H.pdf
LA unions are fighting for rules to limit Airbnbs and other platforms
that transform the city’s rental stock into illegal, unlicensed hotels:
https://upgo.lab.mcgill.ca/publication/strs-in-los-angeles-2022/Wachsmuth_LA_2022.pdf
And the hotel workers organized under UNITE Here are fighting their own
employers: the hoteliers who are aggressively buying up residences,
evicting their long-term tenants, tearing down the building and putting
up a luxury hotel. They got LA council to pass a law requiring hotels to
build new housing to replace any residences they displace:
https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-11-28/airbnb-operators-would-need-police-permit-in-l-a-under-proposed-law
UNITE Here is bargaining for a per-room hotel surcharge to fund housing
specifically for hotel workers, so the people who change the sheets and
clean the toilets don’t have to waste six hours a day commuting to do
so. Labor unions and tenant unions have a long history of collaboration
in the USA. NYC’s first housing coop was midwifed by the Amalgamated
Clothing Workers of America in 1927. The Penn South coop was created by
the International Ladies Garment Workers’ Union. The 1949 Federal
Housing Act passed after American unions pushed hard for it:
http://www.peterdreier.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Labors-Love-Lost.pdf
It goes both ways. Strong unions can create sound housing – and
precarious housing makes unions weaker. Remember during the Hollywood
writers’ strike, when an anonymous studio ghoul told the press the plans
was to “allow things to drag on until union members start losing their
apartments and losing their houses?” Vienna has the most successful
housing in any major city in the world. It’s the city where people of
every income and background live in comfort without being rent-burdened
and without worry about eviction, mold, or leaks. That’s the legacy of
Red Vienna, the Austrian period of Social Democratic Workers’ Party rule
and built vast tracts of high-quality public housing. The system was so
robust that it rebounded after World War II and continues to this day:
https://www.politico.eu/article/vienna-social-housing-architecture-austria-stigma/
Today, the rest of the world is mired in a terrible housing crisis. It’s
not merely that the rent’s too damned high (though it is) – housing
precarity is driving dangerous political instability:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/06/06/the-rents-too-damned-high/ Turning
the human necessity of shelter into a market commodity is a failure. The
economic orthodoxy that insists that public housing, rent control, and
high-density zoning will lead to less housing has failed. rent control
works:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/16/mortgages-are-rent-control/#housing-is-a-human-right-not-an-asset
Leaving housing to the market only produces losers. If you have the bad
luck to invest everything you have into a home in a city that contracts,
you’re wiped out. If you have the bad luck into invest everything into a
home in a “superstar city” where prices go up, you also lose, because
your city becomes uninhabitable and your children can’t afford to live
there: https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/27/lethal-dysfunction/#yimby A
strong labor movement is the best chance we have for breaking the
housing deadlock. And housing is just for starters. Labor is the key to
opening every frozen-in-place dysfunction. Take care work: the aging,
increasingly chronically ill American population is being tortured and
murdered by private equity hospices, long-term care facilities and
health services that have been rolled up by the same private equity
firms that destroyed work and housing:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/26/death-panels/#what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-CMS
In her interview with Capital &amp; Main’s Jessica Goodheart, National
Domestic Workers Alliance president Ai-jen Poo describes how making
things better for care workers will make things better for everyone:
https://prospect.org/labor/2023-12-13-labor-leader-ai-jen-poo-interview/
Care work is a “triple dignity investment”: first, it makes life better
for the worker (most often a woman of color), then, it allows family
members of people who need care to move into higher paid work; and of
course, it makes life better for people who need care: “It delivers
human potential and agency. It delivers a future workforce. It delivers
quality of life.” The failure to fund care work is a massive driver of
inequality. America’s sole federal public provision for care is
Medicaid, which only kicks in after a family it totally impoverished.
Funding care with tax increases polls high with both Democrats and
Republicans, making it good politics:
https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2021/4/7/voters-support-investing-in-the-care-economy
Congress stripped many of the care provisions from Build Back Better,
missing a chance for an “unprecedented, transformational investment in
care.” But the administrative agencies picked up where Congress failed,
following a detailed executive order that identifies existing,
previously unused powers to improve care in America. The EO “expands
access to care, supports family caregivers and improves wages and
conditions for the workforce”:
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/04/18/executive-order-on-increasing-access-to-high-quality-care-and-supporting-caregivers/
States are also filling the void. Washington just created a long-term
care benefit:
https://apnews.com/article/washington-long-term-care-tax-disability-cb54b04b025223dbdba7199db1d254e4
New Mexicans passed a ballot initiative that establishes permanent
funding for child care:
https://www.cwla.org/new-mexico-votes-for-child-care/ New York care
workers won a $3/hour across the board raise:
https://inequality.org/great-divide/new-york-budget-fair-pay-home-care/
The fight is being led by women of color, and they’re kicking ass – and
they’re doing it through their unions. Worker power is the foundation
that we build a better world upon, and it’s surging. Hey look at this

House Approves Impeachment Inquiry Into President Biden</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The House on Wednesday authorized the impeachment
inquiry into President Joe Biden, with every Republican rallying behind
the politically charged process despite lingering concerns among some in
the party that the investigation has yet to produce evidence of
misconduct by the president.</p>
<p>The 221-212 party-line vote put the entire House Republican
conference on record in support of an impeachment process that can lead
to the ultimate penalty for a president: punishment for what the
Constitution describes as “high crimes and misdemeanors,” which can lead
to removal from office if convicted in a Senate trial.</p>
<p>Biden, in a rare statement about the impeachment effort, questioned
the priorities of House Republicans in pursuing an inquiry against him
and his family.</p>
<p>“Instead of doing anything to help make Americans’ lives better, they
are focused on attacking me with lies,” the president said following the
vote. “Instead of doing their job on the urgent work that needs to be
done, they are choosing to waste time on this baseless political stunt
that even Republicans in Congress admit is not supported by facts.”</p>
<p>Authorizing the monthslong inquiry ensures that the impeachment
investigation extends well into 2024, when Biden will be running for
reelection and seems likely to be squaring off against former President
Donald Trump — who was twice impeached during his time in the White
House. Trump has pushed his GOP allies in Congress to move swiftly on
impeaching Biden, part of his broader calls for vengeance and
retribution against his political enemies.</p>
<p>The decision to hold a vote came as Speaker Mike Johnson and his team
faced growing pressure to show progress in what has become a nearly
yearlong probe centered around the business dealings of Biden’s family
members. While their investigation has raised ethical questions, no
evidence has emerged that Biden acted corruptly or accepted bribes in
his current role or previous office as vice president.</p>
<p>“We do not take this responsibility lightly and will not prejudge the
investigation’s outcome,” Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team
said in a joint statement after the vote. “But the evidentiary record is
impossible to ignore.”</p>
<p>House Democrats stood in united opposition to the inquiry resolution
Wednesday, calling it a farce perpetrated by those across the aisle to
avenge the two impeachments against Trump.</p>
<p>“This whole thing is an extreme political stunt. It has no
credibility, no legitimacy, and no integrity. It is a sideshow,”
Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said during a floor debate.</p>
<p>Some House Republicans, particularly those hailing from politically
divided districts, had been hesitant in recent weeks to take any vote on
Biden’s impeachment, fearing a significant political cost. But GOP
leaders have made the case in recent weeks that the resolution is only a
step in the process, not a decision to impeach Biden. That message seems
to have won over skeptics.</p>
<p>“As we have said numerous times before, voting in favor of an
impeachment inquiry does not equal impeachment,” Rep. Tom Emmer, a
member of the GOP leadership team, said at a news conference
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Emmer said Republicans “will continue to follow the facts wherever
they lead, and if they uncover evidence of treason, bribery or other
high crimes and misdemeanors, then and only then will the next steps
towards impeachment proceedings be considered.”</p>
<p>Most of the Republicans reluctant to back the impeachment push have
also been swayed by leadership’s recent argument that authorizing the
inquiry will give them better legal standing as the White House has
questioned the legal and constitutional basis for their requests for
information.</p>
<p>A letter last month from a top White House attorney to Republican
committee leaders portrayed the GOP investigation as overzealous and
illegitimate because the chamber had not yet authorized a formal
impeachment inquiry by a vote of the full House. Richard Sauber, special
counsel to the president, also wrote that when Trump faced the prospect
of impeachment by a Democratic-led House in 2019, Johnson had said at
the time that any inquiry without a House vote would be a “sham.”</p>
<p>Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., said this week that while there was no
evidence to impeach the president, “that’s also not what the vote this
week would be about.”</p>
<p>“We have had enough political impeachments in this country,” he said.
“I don’t like the stonewalling the administration has done, but listen,
if we don’t have the receipts, that should constrain what the House does
long-term.”</p>
<p>Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who has long been opposed to moving forward
with impeachment, said that the White House questioning the legitimacy
of the inquiry without a formal vote helped gain his support. “I can
defend an inquiry right now,” he told reporters this week. “Let’s see
what they find out.”</p>
<p>House Democrats remained unified in their opposition to the
impeachment process, saying it is a farce used by the GOP to take
attention away from Trump and his legal woes.</p>
<p>“You don’t initiate an impeachment process unless there’s real
evidence of impeachable offenses,” said Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking
Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, who oversaw the two
impeachments into Trump. “There is none here. None.”</p>
<p>Democrats and the White House have repeatedly defended the president
and his administration’s cooperation with the investigation thus far,
saying it has already made a massive trove of documents available.</p>
<p>Congressional investigators have obtained nearly 40,000 pages of
subpoenaed bank records and dozens of hours of testimony from key
witnesses, including several high-ranking Justice Department officials
currently tasked with investigating the president’s son, Hunter
Biden.</p>
<p>While Republicans say their inquiry is ultimately focused on the
president himself, they have taken particular interest in Hunter Biden
and his overseas business dealings, from which they accuse the president
of personally benefiting. Republicans have also focused a large part of
their investigation on whistleblower allegations of interference in the
long-running Justice Department investigation into the younger Biden’s
taxes and his gun use.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden is currently facing criminal charges in two states from
the special counsel investigation. He’s charged with firearm counts in
Delaware, alleging he broke laws against drug users having guns in 2018,
a period when he has acknowledged struggling with addiction. Special
counsel David Weiss filed additional charges last week, alleging he
failed to pay about $1.4 million in taxes over a three-year period.</p>
<p>Democrats have conceded that while the president’s son is not
perfect, he is a private citizen who is already being held accountable
by the justice system.</p>
<p>“I mean, there’s a lot of evidence that Hunter Biden did a lot of
improper things. He’s been indicted, he’ll stand trial,” Nadler said.
“There’s no evidence whatsoever that the president did anything
improper.”</p>
<p>Hunter Biden arrived for a rare public statement outside the U.S.
Capitol on Wednesday, saying he would not be appearing for his scheduled
private deposition that morning. The president’s son defended himself
against years of GOP attacks and said his father has had no financial
involvement in his business affairs.</p>
<p>His attorney has offered for Biden to testify publicly, citing
concerns about Republicans manipulating any private testimony.</p>
<p>“Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see
their tactics, expose their baseless inquiry, or hear what I have to
say,” Biden said outside the Capitol. “What are they afraid of? I am
here.”</p>
<p>GOP lawmakers said that since Hunter Biden did not appear, they will
begin contempt of Congress proceedings against him. “He just got into
more trouble today,” Rep. James Comer, the House Oversight Committee
chairman, told reporters Wednesday.</p>

Supreme Court to Rule on Limits on Commonly Used Abortion
Medication</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to take up a
dispute over a medication used in the most common method of abortion in
the United States, its first abortion case since it overturned Roe v.
Wade last year.</p>
<p>The justices will hear appeals from the Biden administration and the
maker of the drug mifepristone asking the high court to reverse an
appellate ruling that would cut off access to the drug through the mail
and impose other restrictions, even in states where abortion remains
legal. The restrictions include shortening from the current 10 weeks to
seven weeks the time during which mifepristone can be used in
pregnancy.</p>
<p>The nine justices did not take up a separate appeal from abortion
opponents who challenged the Food and Drug Administration’s initial
approval of mifepristone as safe and effective in 2000.</p>
<p>The case will be argued in the spring, with a decision likely by late
June, in the middle of the 2024 presidential and congressional
campaigns.</p>
<p>Mifepristone, made by New York-based Danco Laboratories, is one of
two drugs used in medication abortions, which account for more than half
of all abortions in the United States. More than 5 million people have
used it since 2000.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion
in June 2022. That ruling has led to bans on abortion at all stages of
pregnancy in 14 states, with some exceptions, and once cardiac activity
can be detected, which is around six weeks, in two others.</p>
<p>Abortion opponents filed their challenge to mifepristone the
following November and initially won a sweeping ruling six months later
revoking the drug’s approval entirely. The appeals court left intact the
FDA’s initial approval of mifepristone. But it would reverse changes
regulators made in 2016 and 2021 that eased some conditions for
administering the drug.</p>
<p>The justices blocked that ruling from taking effect while the case
played out, though Justices Samuel Alito, the author of last year’s
decision overturning Roe, and Clarence Thomas said they would have
allowed some restrictions to take effect while the case proceeded.</p>
<p>Women seeking to end their pregnancies in the first 10 weeks without
more invasive surgical abortion can take mifepristone, along with
misoprostol. The FDA has eased the terms of mifepristone’s use over the
years, including allowing it to be sent through the mail in states that
allow access.</p>
<p>In its appeal, the Democratic administration said the appeals court
ignored the FDA’s scientific judgment about mifepristone’s safety and
effectiveness since its approval in 2000.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the anti-abortion medical groups and individual
physicians who have challenged the use of mifepristone had urged the
Supreme Court to turn away the appeals.</p>
<p>“The modest decision below merely restores the common-sense
safeguards under which millions of women have taken chemical abortion
drugs,” wrote lawyers for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which
describes itself as a Christian law firm. The lead attorney on the
Supreme Court filing is Erin Hawley, wife of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley
of Missouri.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of President
Donald Trump in Texas, initially revoked FDA approval of
mifepristone.</p>
<p>Responding to a quick appeal, two more Trump appointees on the 5th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the FDA’s original approval would
stand for now. But Judges Andrew Oldham and Kurt Engelhardt said most of
the rest of Kacsmaryk’s ruling could take effect while the case winds
through federal courts.</p>
<p>Besides reducing the time during which the drug can be taken and
halting distribution through the mail, patients who are seeking
medication abortions would have had to make three in-person visits with
a doctor. Women also might have been required to take a higher dosage of
the drug than the FDA says is necessary.</p>
<p>Health care providers have said that if mifepristone is no longer
available or is too hard to obtain, they would switch to using only
misoprostol, which is somewhat less effective in ending pregnancies.</p>

Supreme Court to Hear Case That Could Undo Capitol Riot Charge Against
100s, Including Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would hear an
appeal that could upend hundreds of charges stemming from the Capitol
riot, including against former President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The justices will review a charge of obstruction of an official
proceeding that has been brought against more than 300 people. The
charge refers to the disruption of Congress’ certification of Joe
Biden’s 2020 presidential election victory over Trump. </p>
<p>That’s among four counts brought against Trump in special counsel
Jack Smith’s case that accuses the 2024 Republican presidential primary
front-runner of conspiring to overturn the results of his election loss.
Trump is also charged with conspiracy to obstruct an official
proceeding. </p>
<p>The court’s decision to weigh in on the obstruction charge could
threaten the start of Trump’s trial, currently scheduled for March 4.
The justices separately are considering whether to rule quickly on
Trump’s claim that he can’t be prosecuted for actions taken within his
role as president. A federal judge already has rejected that
argument. </p>
<p>A lawyer for Trump didn’t immediately return a message seeking
comment on the Supreme Court’s decision to review the charge. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court will hear arguments in March or April, with a
decision expected by early summer. </p>
<p>The obstruction charge, which carries up to 20 years behind bars, is
among the most widely used felony charges brought in the massive federal
prosecution following the deadly insurrection on January 6, 2021, when a
mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in a bid to keep Biden, a
Democrat, from taking the White House. </p>
<p>At least 152 people have been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty of
obstructing an official proceeding, and at least 108 of them have been
sentenced, according to an Associated Press review of court
records. </p>
<p>A lower-court judge had dismissed the charge against Joseph Fischer,
a former Pennsylvania police officer, and two other defendants, ruling
it didn’t cover their conduct. The justices agreed to hear the appeal
filed by lawyers for Fischer, who is facing a seven-count indictment for
his actions on January 6, including the obstruction charge. </p>
<p>The other defendants are Edward Jacob Lang, of New York’s Hudson
Valley, and Garret Miller, who has since pleaded guilty to other charges
and was sentenced to 38 months in prison. Miller, who’s from the Dallas
area, could still face prosecution on the obstruction charge. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols found that prosecutors stretched the
law beyond its scope to inappropriately apply it in these cases. Nichols
ruled that a defendant must have taken “some action with respect to a
document, record or other object” to obstruct an official proceeding
under the law. </p>
<p>The Justice Department challenged that ruling, and the appeals court
in Washington agreed with prosecutors in April that Nichols’
interpretation of the law was too limited. </p>
<p>Other defendants, including Trump, are separately challenging the use
of the charge. </p>
<p>Defense attorney Kira Anne West, who has represented several January
6 defendants charged with obstruction of an official proceeding, said
the courts will have to “undo a whole bunch of cases” and adjust many
sentences if the Supreme Court rules in their favor. </p>
<p>“This is a watershed day,” she said. “In our world — defense lawyer
world — this is huge.” </p>
<p>West represents a man scheduled to be tried in early January on
charges including the obstruction count. She doesn’t yet know if she
will seek a delay until the Supreme Court resolves the challenge. </p>
<p>More than 1,200 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming
from the riot, and more than 700 defendants have pleaded guilty.</p>

<h2 id="quick-things-to-know-about-the-cop28-agreement">5 Quick Things
to Know About the COP28 Agreement</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc4NDQzNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNDQzNDI1N30.JORT_0Y23oT4Zy3Bhq7qFPplE80CLAopIv0gFXmIjJg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
After two weeks of intense negotiations and apparent stalemate in Dubai,
all 198 delegates swiftly approved a breakthrough climate
<a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/cma2023_L17_adv.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreement</a>
this morning at COP28. The deal — a culmination of a two-year process
known as the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-negotiations" target="_blank">global
stocktake</a> — isn’t perfect, and it was met with a mix of praise and
disappointment. United Nations climate chief Simon Stiell
<a href="https://twitter.com/simonstiell/status/1734847049038717421" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
that while the deal doesn’t “turn the page” on fossil fuels, it marks
“the beginning of the end” of the fossil fuel era. Here are five things
worth knowing about the agreement:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. It doesn’t call for a fossil fuel phase-out</strong>
</p>
<p>
The agreement avoids the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-fossil-fuels-phaseout" target="_self">contentious
“phase out” wording</a> that nearly derailed the climate talks earlier.
But it does call on countries to accelerate the transition away from
fossil fuels this decade in pursuit of achieving net zero by 2050. This
marks the first time a post-oil and gas future has been mentioned in a
COP agreement, something that would have been “unthinkable just two
years ago,”
<a href="https://twitter.com/James_BG" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a><em>
Business Green</em>’s James Murray.
</p>
<p>
The text also calls for tripling renewable energy capacity, phasing down
unabated coal, reducing methane emissions, phasing out “inefficient”
fossil fuel subsidies, and accelerating zero and low-emissions
technologies including nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage.
</p>
<p>
“This sends a clear signal that the world is moving decisively to phase
out fossil fuels,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/climate/cop28-climate-agreement.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
Jake Schmidt, the senior strategic director for the Natural Resources
Defense Council. “It puts the fossil fuel industry formally on notice
that its old business model is expiring.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. It appears to greenlight natural gas</strong>
</p>
<p>
The final text features a paragraph making it clear that “transitional
fuels” can play a role in the energy transition. This is likely a nod to
natural gas — a fossil fuel often labeled as “clean” compared with coal
but that leads to emissions of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse
gas. Environmentalists worry those emissions will put net zero goals in
danger, but “producers have long argued that gas should complement the
roll-out of intermittent renewables, replacing dirtier fossil fuels like
coal and oil,”
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-13/cop28-deal-signals-role-for-gas-in-transition-to-clean-energy?sref=a2d7LMhq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>
Stephen Stapczynski at <em>Bloomberg Green.</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. It uses ‘weak’ language</strong>
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest criticisms of the deal is that it only “calls on”
countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which some see as little more
than an invitation. “It is the weakest of all the various terms used for
such exhortations,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/climate/cop28-climate-agreement.html">said</a>
<em>CarbonBrief</em>’s Leo Hickman.

<strong>4. Saudi Arabia gave a nod of approval</strong>
</p>
<p>
Saudi Arabia was chief among major oil-producing nations to object to a
call for phasing out fossil fuels, so to eke out a deal, the COP
presidency had to find language that signaled progress on curbing
pollution without crossing Saudi Arabia’s red line. A source
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/reaction-uns-final-proposal-cop28-deal-2023-12-13/#:~:text=The%20deal%20is%20%22a%20menu,the%20context%20of%20sustainable%20development.%22" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
<em>Reuters</em> the Saudis agreed to the deal because it offers “a menu
where every country can follow its own pathway.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. It doesn’t do nearly enough on finance</strong>
</p>
<p>
The text lacks specific commitments from rich nations to help developing
nations transition away from fossil fuels. “Asking Nigeria, or indeed,
asking Africa, to phase out fossil fuels is like asking us to stop
breathing without life support,” Ishaq Salako, Nigeria’s environmental
minister,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/business/dealbook/cop28-climate-deal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
<em>The New York Times</em>.
</p>
<p>
The theme emerging from the reactions seems to be that this deal is
good, but not nearly as good as it could have been. Former Vice
President Al Gore’s lukewarm reaction sums it up pretty well:

<p>Another time I blog about is when I figure something out that I’ve
been trying to understand for a long time, in some cases my whole life.
That still happens. The other day I found myself talking with a friend
about love, why when someone says “I love you” it doesn’t mean what it
seems to. Love comes from understanding someone well enough that you
know what they desire, what they ache to have, and you to try to help
them get it. See all the qualifications in that. Try. Help. Them. In
other words, you can love someone when you know them. And you don’t give
them what they want, you help them get it. You can’t love someone who
your whole idea of is based on a dream you have about them. That’s
different. Anyway, lots more to say about all this. It’s a recurring
topic. It might be the <i>only</i> topic. Someday they’ll invent an AI
that can analyze my writing and tell me if I’ve ever written for any
other purpose than being worthy of love.</p>

to Spend $700M on New Embassy in Ireland, Breaks Ground on New Embassy
in Saudi Arabia</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Biden administration has notified Congress that it
intends to spend nearly $700 million to buy a former Dublin hotel,
demolish it and construct new buildings to turn the site into the new
U.S. Embassy in Ireland. The State Department also announced that it had
broken ground on a new embassy complex in Saudi Arabia as part of a
revamp of its diplomatic facilities in the Gulf.</p>
<p>The department informed lawmakers late Monday that it plans to buy
the former Jury’s Hotel in Dublin’s upscale Ballsbridge neighborhood for
$171 million. Associated costs, including the design and construction of
the new chancery and furnishing it, will bring the total to $688.8
million, according to a notice sent to Congress.</p>
<p>The 4.2 acre (1.7 hectare) property is located just a block from the
existing U.S. embassy in the Irish capital, which dates to the 1960s and
the State Department said “is well beyond its useful life, is too small
for our operational needs, and is not functional in its layout.”</p>
<p>The new compound will include the embassy, a residence for Marine
guards, support facilities and parking, the notice said. It did not give
an estimate for when the project would be completed but estimated that
there would be 189 employees at the new embassy in 2028, at least 109 of
whom would require office space.</p>
<p>The U.S. has been planning to relocate its embassy in Dublin for more
than a decade and the Ballsbridge site had been the expected site after
Irish authorities approved zoning and other changes for it last
year.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the department announced that it had broken ground on
construction of a new U.S. embassy on a 27.5-acre (11.1-hectare) site in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that it acquired in early 2020. That cost, along
with the construction of a new U.S. consulate in Jeddah and planning for
a new consulate in Dhahran, was more than $1 billion.</p>

had a long chat yesterday with
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22Guy+Kawasaki%22">Guy
Kawasaki</a>. Along the way he wondered how I find something to write
every day. The answer – I don’t find things to write, it doesn’t work
that way. I don’t sit down in the morning and say OK now I have to write
1000 words and it doesn’t matter what it’s about. If I have something to
say I say it. And as you can tell, I usually do have something to say,
because I’m always thinking and planning, trying to figure out what I
want, or if I already know, how to get other people to help me get
there. A lot of trial and error, let’s see if this way of putting it
works, or that one, etc. There’s a slogan for this –
<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2009/08/09/narrateYourWork.html">Narrate
Your Work</a> – and my work is narratable and creates its own record
because I do my work right
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/12/13.html#a140021">here</a>, because
much of my work involves other people. Actually all of it. And if I can
get the people I need to listen to me, ie read my blog, then we can work
together (a recurring theme) to make great communication systems out of
the web and avoid flushing our future down the toilet, which we always
seem to be doing.</p>

pretty sure federation in social media is the wrong bet. We have to
think more broadly. What are the benefits we want from interop in social
media. Federation isn’t itself a benefit. It’s an idea hatched by
techies who aren’t thinking about how people actually use these systems
and which features are valued and which are problematic. Imho, what’s
valued is the ability to publish something quickly, and without much
fuss, and follow others, again easily without having to have a deep
understanding of how these things are architected. No one but us
programming plumbers cares. I think the idea of <i>conversation</i> not
only is overrated, but it’s where all the problems are, where all the
abuse happens. If we focus on the benefits, quick dissemination of news,
and the power of the individual to choose their sources and share them
with others – that’s where the juice is. Imho of course, ymmv, praise

dominated. But delve deeper, and you can also start to see the influence

as oil prices slide, COP28 comes to an agreement using the words “fossil

id="isolated-internationally-on-gaza-biden-delivers-rebuke-to-netanyahu">Isolated
Internationally on Gaza, Biden Delivers Rebuke to Netanyahu</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — In a sign that the United States is getting
increasingly concerned over the scale of civilian casualties from
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, President Joe Biden delivered a
public rebuke to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, even as
he maintains staunch support for Israel.</p>
<p>“We have made it clear to the Israelis, and they are aware that … the
safety of innocent Palestinians is still a great concern. And so, the
actions they’re taking must be consistent with attempting to do
everything possible to prevent innocent Palestinian civilians from being
hurt, murdered, killed, lost, etc,,” Biden said at a press conference
during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to the White
House.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy is in the U.S. to lobby for military and economic aid for
his country’s fight against Russia’s invasion. Aid to Ukraine and Israel
are being blocked by Republican lawmakers who are demanding concessions
on U.S. immigration policy.</p>
<p>Biden has grown more vocal with his public criticism of Israel’s
military campaign that is now into its third month. Speaking off-camera
to Democratic donors for his 2024 reelection bid earlier Tuesday, Biden
said Israel is starting to lose support around the world because of its
“indiscriminate bombings,” according to a White House transcript of the
event.</p>
<p>Biden’s comment stands in contrast to those of White House officials
who say Israel has taken measures to make their strikes more targeted to
avoid civilian deaths.</p>
<p>“He’s [Netanyahu] a good friend, but I think he has to change. … This
government in Israel is making it very difficult for him to move,” Biden
said.</p>
<p>The president singled out Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel’s far-right
national security minister.</p>
<p>“Ben-Gvir and company and the new folks, they don’t want anything
remotely approaching a two-state solution,” he said. “They not only want
to have retribution, which they should for what the Palestinians — Hamas
— did, but against all Palestinians.”</p>
<p>He suggested Netanyahu will need to empower the Palestinian Authority
to become a partner in the peace process toward the two-state solution,
which Israeli hard-liners oppose.</p>
<p>“You cannot say there’s no Palestinian state at all in the future.
And that’s going to be the hard part,” Biden said, even as he
underscored that the U.S. will not do “a damn thing other than protect
Israel in the process.”</p>
<p>Biden said national security adviser Jake Sullivan will travel to the
region this week and meet with the Israeli war Cabinet to emphasize U.S.
commitment to Israel, as well as the need to protect civilian life and
ensure more humanitarian assistance into Gaza.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will also travel to the region to step
up international efforts to protect the free flow of commerce through
the Red Sea that has been disrupted by Iran-backed Houthi militants
attacking vessels heading into Israel.</p>
<p>Cease-fire resolution</p>
<p>Biden’s remarks came amid an overwhelming vote at the United Nations
General Assembly supporting a cease-fire in Gaza that further isolates
Washington. The vote in the 193-member world body was 153 in favor, 10
against and 23 abstentions.</p>
<p>“Our duty is to try to save the lives who are still alive by having
this resolution adopted and by forcing Israel to comply with it. And
those who are shielding Israel to comply with the global consensus,”
said Riyad Mansour, Palestinian permanent observer to the United
Nations.”</p>
<p>The vote followed a similar resolution in the U.N. Security Council
last week that failed due to a U.S. veto. There are no vetoes in the
General Assembly.</p>
<p>While General Assembly resolutions are nonbinding, they carry
political weight. U.N. member states are shaping “the narrative that the
U.S. is standing alone in opposing the cease-fire,” and “looking for
every means possible to create a sense of moral pressure on the U.S. to
change its posture,” said Richard Gowan, U.N. director of the
International Crisis Group.</p>
<p>“The Arab group at the U.N. wants to make the Americans nervous,” he
told VOA. “It wants to send the message that America is losing
international goodwill because of its stance.”</p>
<p>Biden’s critics say his unwavering support to Israel jeopardizes
Washington’s interests.</p>
<p>The administration is inflicting “deep damage and lasting damage” to
its ties with key countries beyond the Middle East, said Josh Paul, a
former U.S. diplomat who resigned in protest over U.S. policy of sending
arms to Israel without oversight.</p>
<p>“But also, where we are arguing, for example, in the United Nations
to gain the support of the Global South for our just condemnation of
Russia’s abhorrent invasion of Ukraine,” Paul told VOA. “We are also
going to lose votes if we are seen to be hypocritical, if we’re seen to
be walking away from our values.”</p>
<p>Administration officials and other supporters of Israel say they
support humanitarian pauses but that a cease-fire would allow Hamas, a
U.S.-designated terror organization, to regroup and plan future
attacks.</p>
<p>A cease-fire allows Hamas to have a legitimacy that it hasn’t earned,
said Julie Rayman, managing director of policy and political affairs at
the American Jewish Committee.</p>
<p>“It’s giving trust to terrorist leaders who have proven unequivocally
that they are not trustworthy,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Hamas fighters stormed from the Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns
on October 7, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 200 hostages.
Gaza health officials say Israel’s military response has displaced at
least 2 million people and killed more than 18,000 in the bloodiest
campaign of the decadeslong Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

Nobody invented capitalism. It’s what all people voluntarily do, to

concludes electric car adoption is seeing “genuine exponential growth”
across the world and that EVs “are highly likely to dominate the global
passenger car fleet in the near future, less than a decade from today.”
After analyzing the uptake of passenger EVs across 17 individual
countries, Europe, and the world, the researchers believe that
“system-wide adoption” will happen much faster than other estimates
suggest. In Europe, for example, the researchers predict the majority of
passenger cars will be EVs by 2031. The findings, published in the
journal <em>PLOS One,</em> hint at “radical economic and infrastructural
consequences in the near future.”

Recalls Over 2 Million Vehicles to Fix Defective System that Monitors
Drivers Using Autopilot</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Detroit, Mich — Tesla is recalling more than 2 million vehicles
across its model lineup to fix a defective system that’s supposed to
ensure drivers are paying attention when they use Autopilot.</p>
<p>Documents posted Wednesday by U.S. safety regulators say the company
will send out a software update to fix the problems.</p>
<p>The recall comes after a two-year investigation by the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration into a series of crashes that
happened while the Autopilot partially automated driving system was in
use. Some were deadly.</p>
<p>The agency says its investigation found Autopilot’s method of
ensuring that drivers are paying attention can be inadequate and can
lead to foreseeable misuse of the system.</p>
<p>The recall covers nearly all of the vehicles Tesla sold in the U.S.
and includes models Y, S, 3 and X produced between Oct. 5, 2012, and
Dec. 7 of this year.</p>
<p>The software update includes additional controls and alerts “to
further encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving
responsibility,” the documents said.</p>
<p>The update was to be sent to certain affected vehicles on Tuesday,
with the rest getting it at a later date, the documents said.</p>
<p>Autopilot includes features called Autosteer and Traffic Aware Cruise
Control, with Autosteer intended for use on limited access freeways when
it’s not operating with a more sophisticated feature called Autosteer on
City Streets. </p>
<p>The software update apparently will limit where Autosteer can be
used.</p>
<p>“If the driver attempts to engage Autosteer when conditions are not
met for engagement, the feature will alert the driver it is unavailable
through visual and audible alerts, and Autosteer will not engage,” the
recall documents said. </p>
<p>Depending on a Tesla’s hardware, the added controls include
“increasing prominence” of visual alerts, simplifying how Autosteer is
turned on and off, additional checks on whether Autosteer is being used
outside of controlled access roads and when approaching traffic control
devices, “and eventual suspension from Autosteer use if the driver
repeatedly fails to demonstrate continuous and sustained driving
responsibility,” the documents say.</p>
<p>Recall documents say that agency investigators met with Tesla
starting in October to explain “tentative conclusions” about the fixing
the monitoring system. Tesla, it said, did not agree with the agency’s
analysis but agreed to the recall on Dec. 5 in an effort to resolve the
investigation.</p>
<p>Auto safety advocates for years have been calling for stronger
regulation of the driver monitoring system, which mainly detects whether
a driver’s hands are on the steering wheel. They have called for cameras
to make sure a driver is paying attention, which are used by many other
automakers with similar systems.</p>
<p>Autopilot can steer, accelerate and brake automatically in its lane,
but is a driver-assist system and cannot drive itself despite its name.
Independent tests have found that the monitoring system is easy to fool,
so much that drivers have been caught while driving drunk or even
sitting in the back seat.</p>
<p>In its defect report filed with the safety agency, Tesla said
Autopilot’s controls “may not be sufficient to prevent driver
misuse.”</p>
<p>A message was left early Wednesday seeking further comment from the
Austin, Texas, company.</p>
<p>Tesla says on its website that Autopilot and a more sophisticated
Full Self Driving system cannot drive autonomously and are meant to help
drivers who have to be ready to intervene at all times. Full Self
Driving is being tested by Tesla owners on public roads.</p>
<p>In a statement posted Monday on X, formerly Twitter, Tesla said
safety is stronger when Autopilot is engaged.</p>
<p>NHTSA has dispatched investigators to 35 Tesla crashes since 2016 in
which the agency suspects the vehicles were running on an automated
system. At least 17 people have been killed.</p>
<p>The investigations are part of a larger probe by the NHTSA into
multiple instances of Teslas using Autopilot crashing into parked
emergency vehicles that are tending to other crashes. NHTSA has become
more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas in the past
year, announcing multiple recalls and investigations, including a recall
of Full Self Driving software.</p>
<p>In May, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose department
includes NHTSA, said Tesla shouldn’t be calling the system Autopilot
because it can’t drive itself.</p>
<p>In its statement Wednesday, NHTSA said the Tesla investigation
remains open “as we monitor the efficacy of Tesla’s remedies and
continue to work with the automaker to ensure the highest level of
safety.”</p>

To track down an alleged mail thief, a US postal inspector used license
plate reader technology, GPS data collected by a rental car company,
and, most damning of all, hid a camera inside one of the targeted blue
post boxes which captured the suspect’s full face as they allegedly
helped themselves to swathes of peoples’ mail.

better to transition or phase out?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> After last minute horse-trading at
the COP28 climate conference, 200 countries have agreed to a deal that
calls for a transition away from fossil fuels for the first time. But
critics argue it doesn’t go far enough. Meanwhile, Argentina’s new
president Javier Milei is pressing ahead with his shock therapy plan for
the economy, starting with a devaluation of the peso. And we also take a
look at the economic problems at the top of the agenda in Egypt’s
election.

<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Bots, again
</h1>
<p>
I come home from a friendly meetup and notice that my tiny web-server
has a load of 80 instead of the usual 0.5. What the hell is going on? I
look at the logs of the last 24 hours and see an IP number with more
than 100 000 hits in the last 24h. What are they doing?
</p>
<p>
Whois tells me it is from the “Alibaba Cloud”. Oh yeah? What are the
Chinese trying to do on my site?
</p>
<p>
I start poking around. More and more IP numbers from all over the net
show up. Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud.
</p>
<p>
All right, so I’m blocking some of them individually as I go, but after
a while I realize that I probably have to block them at the network
level.
</p>
<p>
For the moment I’m also taking down one of the wikis that’s overloading
my server.
</p>
<p>
Just looking at the top 10 offenders for two of my domains, and running
whois on them to find the entire network they belong to, and checking
that it’s Alibaba or Tencent:
</p>
<pre><code># Alibaba Cloud 2023-12-10
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.76.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.80.0.0/13'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.74.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.235.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.246.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.244.0.0/15'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.240.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.236.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
# Tencent Cloud

RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '43.142.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '124.220.0.0/14'&quot;
RewriteRule ^ https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
If I want this to be for the entire server and not repeat it for each
location, I guess I’ll have to use Apache rewrite rules.
</p>
<p>
While I’m doing this, I notice a new pattern… My wiki software allows
you to fetch a feed for every page. Either it contains updates to the
page (Oddmuse), or a feed of the pages linked (Oddmu). It’s for humans.
</p>
<p>
Of course some shit engineer decided that it was a good idea to scan the
web for all the feeds that are out there (so rare! so precious!) and to
download them all, forever (uncover the darknet! server our customers!)
and now I have to block IP number ranges, add robot agents to robots.txt
files (not all of them provide one), or block user agents (not all of
them provide a useful one) and I block and block and block (for the
environment! to avoid +2.0°C and the end of human civilization!) and all
this while I know that all these shit requests exist out there, for all
the sites, everywhere – a hundred thousand requests or more per day, per
site, wasting CO₂ – and what am I going to do, kill the feeds for humans
because some shit engineer decided to feed a machine?
</p>
<p>
I’m on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)#The_Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian
Jihad</a> again.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and Virgin Media is downloading tons of PDFs I’m hosting? Are they
looking for copyright violations? On the blocklist they go.
</p>
<p>
And what’s this, Feedly is also downloading feeds like crazy, every few
minutes? Slow down, idiots. My news is not important. On the blocklist
they go. Or are you trying to train your stupid intelligence? Fuck this
AI training stuff. I already use “X-Robots-Tag: noimageai” but I guess I
should add even more HTTP headers to block even more engineers
overstepping boundaries?
</p>
<p>
Ah, and MonitoRSS going into overdrive, from the Amazon Cloud. Really, I
don’t think there are humans in the Amazon Cloud. Onto the blocklist
they go. Well, at least this IP range.
</p>
<p>
And who’s that VelenPublicWebCrawler, zealously collecting pages? Onto
the blocklists they go.
</p>
<p>
Following a lead from StackExchange and looking at the
<code>ipset</code> manual I see that the type <code>hash:net</code>
supports banning entire networks!
</p>
<p>
Here’s a <code>fish</code> script:
</p>
<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/fish

# Use hash:net because of the CIDR stuff
ipset create banlist hash:net
iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP
iptables -I FORWARD -m set --match-set banlist src -j DROP

<p>U.S. lawmakers called for a tougher stance against Iran Tuesday as

<p><strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Jessica">@Jessica</span>
Smith’s blog</strong> (date: 2023-12-13, from: Jessica Smith’s blog)</p>
<p>
The last few days have been really productive for me creatively. I’ve
made <em>so much</em> progress on a <strong>thorough</strong> outline of
book 2 of
<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/wiki/my-novel.html" title="a wiki page about my project">my
<abbr title="Work In Progress">WIP</abbr></a>, with proper through-lines
of narrative
tension,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
and I’m feeling really good about how the actual writing of it is going
to go. I also did a cold reread of book 1, and was really happy with it,
actually! I’d <em>even</em> say it’s about ready to start seeking out
feedback from other people 😬
</p>
<p>
And… what did I have to do to start making progress again? It seems like
the solution is simple:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
get a temporary reprieve from the neverending stress that is renovating
a house. (I swear I will have a blog post up about this one day)
</li>
<li>
close all social media apps and browser tabs.
</li>
<li>
close my web browser entirely, or have it open only for

so I have something to keep my hands busy when I’m thinking.
</li>
<li>
just reread the damn thing! yes, it takes hours, but it’s the only way
to reimmerse myself in the story from zero. (also, now that book 1 is
relatively polished, I genuinely enjoy it! almost like there’s something
to that “write what you want to read” advice.)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So there you have it; that’s what I’ve been up to. In what has otherwise
been a bit of a tough year for me, it feels great to be optimistic about
something for once 😊

<h2
id="russian-missile-attack-targets-kyiv-as-zelenskyy-pushes-for-us-aid">Russian
Missile Attack Targets Kyiv as Zelenskyy Pushes for US Aid</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — A barrage of Russian missiles targeted Ukraine’s
capital, injuring at least 45 people Wednesday, as President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy urged U.S. officials to approve $61 billion in new aid to help
his country fight off Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s air forces said the country’s air defenses downed all 10
ballistic missiles launched by Russia.</p>
<p>Falling debris from the downed missiles damaged a children’s hospital
and the city’s water system, Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said, while
Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration, said debris also
hit several homes.</p>
<p>“Russia has proven once again that it is a heinous country that fires
missiles at night, trying to hit residential areas, kindergartens, and
energy facilities during the winter,” Zelenskyy said Wednesday on social
media. “There will be a response. Certainly.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy added that he and U.S. President Joe Biden had agreed to
work on increasing the number of Ukraine’s air defense systems, and that
Russia had “demonstrated how critical this decision is.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration Tuesday announced up to $200 million in new
military aid, including air defense missiles and components, for Ukraine
from previously approved resources.</p>
<p>The announcement came as Zelenskyy used his visit to Washington to
make a forceful case for a new commitment of $61 billion in aid to help
his country’s war cause as the U.S. Congress decides on the matter.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian leader rejected the notion that his nation would cede
territory to the Russians after nearly two years of brutal warfare.</p>
<p>“That’s insane, to be honest,” Zelenskyy said.</p>
<p>He added: “I don’t know whose idea it is, but I have a question to
these people: if they are ready to give up their children to terrorists.
I think not.”</p>
<p>Biden also pressed for Ukrainian victory and seemed to push back
against starting negotiations with Moscow.</p>
<p>“We need to ensure Putin continues to fail in Ukraine and Ukraine to
succeed,” he said. “And the best way for that to do that is to pass the
supplemental” funding request.</p>
<p>But the U.S. Congress, which signs the checks, is not yet convinced.
Earlier Tuesday, Zelenskyy met with lawmakers in an attempt to persuade
them.</p>
<p>Republicans say they want to see “proper oversight” of the funding,
and they also want to see “a clear articulation of strategy.”</p>
<p>Biden, meanwhile, accused Republicans of playing into Moscow’s hands
by failing to pass the aid package.</p>
<p>“The host of a Kremlin-run show said, ‘Well done, Republicans. That’s
good for us,’” he said, adding: “If you’re being celebrated by Russian
propagandists, it might be time to rethink what you’re doing. History
will judge harshly those who turn their back on freedom’s cause.”</p>
<p>Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused Zelenskyy of “cadging” – slang
meaning to beg for something undeserved – and said he is an American
puppet.</p>
<p>But U.S. taxpayers are showing signs of Ukraine fatigue, and some
Republicans question why about a third of U.S. money goes not toward
weapons, but government assistance.</p>
<p>John Jameson, a mine-clearing campaigner who recently visited the
country, said Ukraine needs every penny.</p>
<p>“The deminers were working while we heard the sound of artillery
going on,” he told VOA, on Zoom. “And they’re doing that because they
know it’s essential for them to be able to start farming and producing
and going back to work now so they can live so they can not only just to
fight the war but so they can live but no, we can’t wait until the
fighting is over.”</p>
<p>But when will it end? Analysts say this may take more than a year –
and question whether Ukraine’s supporters are funding it enough,
considering how well this small army has done against a much larger
foe.</p>
<p>“They’ve become, in some ways, victims of their own success,” said
Dalibor Rohac, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
“I don’t think we should be sort of reasonably asking Ukrainians to do
more, especially given the almost homeopathic nature of Western
assistance. When you think about the amounts of munitions that are being
delivered – the miniscule amounts of long range artillery, precision
artillery, air defenses, etc, etc, that are being delivered to Ukraine.
I think they are making a really impressive use of very limited
resources that are given to them, provided to them, against a much
larger adversary.”</p>
<p>This urgent discussion comes as Biden on Tuesday announced another
$200 million in military aid for Ukraine from previously approved
resources.</p>
<p>Biden has asked Congress for a $110 billion package of wartime
funding for Ukraine and Israel, along with other national security
priorities.</p>
<p>But Republicans in the U.S. Senate have balked, saying major U.S.
border security changes are needed.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are asking for the immediate deportation of migrants
who entered the country illegally, stripping them of a chance to seek
U.S. asylum. They have also called for greatly scaling back Biden
administration programs that have allowed hundreds of thousands of
migrants to enter the U.S. lawfully.</p>
<p>The U.S. has already provided Ukraine $111 billion for its fight
against Russia’s 2022 invasion.</p>

id="threat-of-violence-in-the-us-likely-heightened-with-holidays-approaching">Threat
of Violence in the US ‘Likely Heightened’ With Holidays Approaching</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Unabated anger and tensions over the ongoing conflict
between Israel and Hamas could spill over into the holiday season in the
United States, potentially putting large public gatherings at risk,
according to law enforcement and homeland security officials.</p>
<p>The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security late Tuesday issued a
public service announcement, warning of a heightened threat to holiday
or faith-based events and New Year’s Eve celebrations in the coming
weeks.</p>
<p>The announcement further warned of potential dangers to protests,
rallies and other First Amendment-protected events.</p>
<p>“Ongoing tensions related to the conflict between Israel and Hamas
likely heighten the threat of lone actor violence targeting large public
gatherings throughout the winter,” the statement said. “These targets
likely remain attractive to lone actors inspired by a range of
ideologies due to their accessibility and symbolic nature.”</p>
<p>According to the FBI and DHS, there is no specific or credible
intelligence to suggest an attack is in the works, but the statement
warns there has been “a spike in reporting on potential hate crimes or
other criminal violations” since the October 7 Hamas terror attack in
Israel that killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, with some 240
people taken hostage.</p>
<p>The Israeli military response has since displaced an estimated 2
million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, where the Hamas-run Health
Ministry says nearly 18,000 people have been killed, most of them women
and children.</p>
<p>The FBI and DHS warning said any escalation of the conflict could
“further exacerbate the threat of violence.”</p>
<p>Just last week, DHS issued a new guide to help faith-based
organizations, including churches, synagogues and mosques, take steps to
better secure their facilities and their congregations.</p>
<p>The same day, FBI Director Christopher Wray told U.S. lawmakers that
the bureau’s hate crime caseload had spiked by 60% since October, with
the majority of threats targeting the Jewish community.</p>
<p>The just-released public service announcement noted both the FBI and
DHS have also seen a jump in hoax bomb threats and active shooter
threats aimed at synagogues “likely intended to disrupt services and
intimidate congregants.”</p>
<p>The new advisory updates a previous warning from October 25.</p>
<p>U.S. homeland security officials have previously said the country has
been mired for more than a year now in a “heightened threat
environment,” with the biggest threat coming from U.S.-based extremists
motivated by “enduring racial, ethnic, religious and anti-government
ideologies.”</p>

win: jury decides Google has illegal monopoly in app store fight</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Three years after Fortnite-maker Epic Games sued Apple and Google for
allegedly running illegal app store monopolies, Epic has a win. The jury
in Epic v. Google has just delivered its verdict — and it found that
Google turned its Google Play app store and Google Play Billing service
into an illegal monopoly. After just a few hours of deliberation, the
jury unanimously answered yes to every question put before them — that
Google has monopoly power in the Android app distribution markets and
in-app billing services markets, that Google did anticompetitive things
in those markets, and that Epic was injured by that behavior. They
decided Google has an illegal tie between its Google Play app store and
its Google Play Billing payment services, too, and that its distribution
agreement, Project Hug deals with game developers, and deals with OEMs
were all anticompetitive. ↫ Sean Hollister for The Verge Good news, of
course, but it does make one wonder why a judge in Epic’s case versus
Apple ruled the exact opposite as the jury did today. We don’t yet know
what this verdict will mean for Google in a practical sense – that’s up
to the judge, and Google intends to appeal, for course – so if consumers
will actually see any benefit from this remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The Timeline feature in Maps helps you remember places you’ve been
and is powered by a setting called Location History. If you’re among the
subset of users who have chosen to turn Location History on (it’s off by
default), soon your Timeline will be saved right on your device — giving
you even more control over your data. Just like before, you can delete
all or part of your information at any time or disable the setting
entirely. If you’re getting a new phone or are worried about losing your
existing one, you can always choose to back up your data to the cloud so
it doesn’t get lost. We’ll automatically encrypt your backed-up data so
no one can read it, including Google. ↫ Marlo McGriff, Director of
Product, Google Maps, at Google’s official blog All else being equal,
moving location data from residing unencrypted in the cloud to on your
device is a good thing. That being said, if Google is giving up access
to this data, it most likely means they’ve gotten really good at
estimating your whereabouts using other data instead.</p>
