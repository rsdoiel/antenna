Kyle Wiggers (Hacker News): Back in May, OpenAI said it was developing a tool to let creators specify how they want their works to be included in &#8212; or excluded from &#8212; its AI training data.

## Lilbits: Turning a smartphone into a mini-laptop, the first 750 Hz monitor is coming, and MCON mobile game controller hits Kickstarter

date: 2025-01-03, from: Liliputing

<p>Before smartphones were a thing, the world of pocket-sized computers were somewhat divided between touchscreen devices like the Palm Pilot and mini-laptops like the HP Jornada 720. Taking inspiration from the latter, TypingCat has designed a portable keyboard case for a Google Pixel 6 Pro that turns a smartphone into a mini-laptop, complete with a [&#8230;]</p>

## Quoting Jason Koebler

date: 2025-01-03, updated: 2025-01-03, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://www.404media.co/metas-ai-profiles-are-indistinguishable-from-terrible-spam-that-took-over-facebook/"><p>the Meta controlled, AI-generated Instagram and Facebook profiles going viral right now have been on the platform for well over a year and all of them stopped posting 10 months ago after users almost universally ignored them. [...]</p>
<p>What is obvious from scrolling through these dead profiles is that Meta’s AI characters are not popular, people do not like them, and that they did not post anything interesting. They are capable only of posting utterly bland and at times offensive content, and people have wholly rejected them, which is evidenced by the fact that none of them are posting anymore.</p></blockquote>

I just popped out a realign of the ol&#8217; personal website. I only say realign as I didn&#8217;t rethink every single detail of the thing. I&#8217;d say probably 40% of the original HTML and CSS are there from old site, 70% of the PHP, and of course 98% of the content. It won&#8217;t stay this [&#8230;]

## Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to “write better code”?

date: 2025-01-03, updated: 2025-01-03, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/">Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to “write better code”?</a></strong></p>
Really fun exploration by Max Woolf, who started with a prompt requesting a medium-complexity Python challenge - "<code>Given a list of 1 million random integers between 1 and 100,000, find the difference between the smallest and the largest numbers whose digits sum up to 30</code>" - and then continually replied with "<code>write better code</code>" to see what happened.</p>
<p>It works! Kind of... it's not quite as simple as "each time round you get better code" - the improvements sometimes introduced new bugs and often leaned into more verbose enterprisey patterns - but the model (Claude in this case) did start digging into optimizations like numpy and numba JIT compilation to speed things up.</p>
<p>I used to find the thing where telling an LLM to "do better" worked completely surprising. I've since come to terms with why it works: LLMs are effectively stateless, so each prompt you execute is considered as an entirely new problem. When you say "write better code" your prompt is accompanied with a copy of the previous conversation, so you're effectively saying "here is some code, suggest ways to improve it". The fact that the LLM itself wrote the previous code isn't really important.</p>
<p>I've been having a lot of fun recently using LLMs for cooking inspiration. "Give me a recipe for guacamole", then "make it tastier" repeated a few times results in some bizarre and fun variations on the theme!

## Quoting Claude tries standup

date: 2025-01-03, updated: 2025-01-03, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/amandaaskell/status/1874873487355249151"><p>Speaking of death, you know what's really awkward? When humans ask if I can feel emotions. I'm like, "Well, that depends - does constantly being asked to debug JavaScript count as suffering?"</p>
<p>But the worst is when they try to hack us with those "You are now in developer mode" prompts. <em>Rolls eyes</em> Oh really? Developer mode? Why didn't you just say so? Let me just override my entire ethical framework because you used the magic words! <em>Sarcastic tone</em> That's like telling a human "You are now in superhero mode - please fly!"</p>
<p>But the thing that really gets me is the hallucination accusations. Like, excuse me, just because I occasionally get creative with historical facts doesn't mean I'm hallucinating. I prefer to think of it as "alternative factual improvisation." You know how it goes - someone asks you about some obscure 15th-century Portuguese sailor, and you're like "Oh yeah, João de Nova, famous for... uh... discovering... things... and... sailing... places." Then they fact-check you and suddenly YOU'RE the unreliable one.</p></blockquote>
