<h2 id="us-approves-two-gene-therapies-for-sickle-cell-disease">US
Approves Two Gene Therapies for Sickle Cell Disease</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday approved a pair
of gene therapies for sickle cell disease, including the first treatment
based on the breakthrough CRISPR gene editing technology. </p>
<p>The agency approved Lyfgenia from bluebird bio, and a separate
treatment called Casgevy by partners Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR
Therapeutics. </p>
<p>Both the therapies were approved for people aged 12 years and
older. </p>
<p>The Vertex/CRISPR gene therapy uses the breakthrough gene editing
technology that won its inventors the Nobel Prize in 2020. </p>
<p>Sickle cell disease is a painful, inherited blood disorder that can
be debilitating and lead to premature death. It affects an estimated
100,000 people in the United States, most of whom are Black. </p>
<p>In sickle cell disease, the body makes flawed, sickle-shaped
hemoglobin, impairing the ability of red blood cells to properly carry
oxygen to the body’s tissues. </p>
<p>The sickle cells tend to stick together and can block small blood
vessels, causing intense pain. It also can lead to strokes and organ
failure. </p>
<p>U.S.-listed shares of CRISPR therapeutics were up 1.6%, while Vertex
Pharmaceuticals stock was down 1.4%. Shares of bluebird bio were halted
for trading ahead of the news. </p>
<p>Makers of both the therapies have pitched them as one-time
treatments, but data on how long their effect lasts is limited. The only
longer-term treatment for sickle cell disease is a bone marrow
transplant. </p>
<p>“I actually am very reticent to call them a cure. I prefer to call
them a transformative therapy because patients will still have sickle
cell disease on the other side of gene therapy,” said Dr Sharl Azar,
medical director of the Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Treatment
Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. </p>
<p>Bluebird bio’s sickle cell therapy is designed to work by inserting
modified genes into the body through disabled viruses to help the
patient’s red blood cells produce normal hemoglobin. </p>
<p>For Vertex’s therapy, patients must have stem cells harvested from
their bone marrow. The cells are then sent to manufacturing facilities
where they are edited using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Once the cells are
incubated, they are infused back into the patient during a month-long
hospital stay. </p>
<p>Both gene therapies can take several months and involve high-dose
chemotherapy, but this has potential risks of infertility. </p>
<p>“Not everybody who undergoes chemotherapy will end up having
infertility, but the majority of them will,” said Dr Azar.  </p>
<p>While the risk can be managed by fertility preservation methods like
freezing eggs and sperm banking, this is only covered by insurance for
cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy and not those receiving gene
therapy, said Dr. Azar. </p>
<p>He said the out-of-pocket expense on it can be as high as
$40,000. </p>
<p>FDA staff in documents released ahead of an October meeting of a
panel of independent experts on Vertex’s therapy had also flagged
concerns of unintended genomic alterations from the treatment. </p>
<p>The company plans to assess potential long-term safety risks through
a 15-year follow-up study after approval. </p>
<p>Vertex’s CRISPR therapy is also under an FDA review for another blood
disease, transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia, with a decision
expected by March 30.</p>

Treasury Sanctions People in 9 Countries for Human Rights Abuses</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury’s ’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Friday
announced sanctions against 20 individuals in nine countries for human
rights abuses.</p>
<p>Friday’s sanctions include 13 individuals targeted for their roles in
perpetrating or condoning the perpetration of rape and other forms of
sexual violence in the Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of
Congo, Haiti, and South Sudan.</p>
<p>In addition, two Taliban officials in Afghanistan were designated for
abuse related to the repression of rights for woman and girls based
solely on their gender. In Iran, two intelligence officers were
designated for cracking down on opponents of the government and peaceful
protests.</p>
<p>Two Chinese government officials in Xinjiang province were also
targeted for serious human rights abuses against the Uyghur Muslim
ethnic minority.</p>
<p>In announcing the sanctions, the department noted the upcoming 75th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, or UDHR, “the
landmark document enshrining human rights and fundamental freedoms for
all individuals.”</p>
<p>The declaration was drafted by representatives from all regions of
the world and proclaimed by the U.N. General Assembly in Paris on
December 10, 1948.</p>
<p>The department also noted U.S. President Joe Biden has made promoting
accountability for conflict-related sexual violence a top priority,
signing a memorandum last year to strengthen the U.S. government’s
efforts to combat it, using financial, diplomatic, and legal tools.</p>
<p>In the statement, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the U.S.
commitment to upholding human rights is sacrosanct.</p>
<p>She said the sanctions announced Friday — and over the course of the
past year — “underscore the seriousness of our commitment to promoting
accountability for human rights abuse and safeguarding the U.S.
financial system from those who commit these egregious acts.”</p>
<p>Some information for this report was provided by Reuters.</p>

Ultraviolet Grasslands with Fantasy Traveller

<blockquote>
<p>
One day master Liù asked his student: what’s the sound a single d20
makes in your hand? The student could not reply. That same evening the
student saw master Liù rolling 2d6 at the gaming table and was
enlightened.

<p>
Not long ago, I noticed that the spectre of plagiarism was raising its
head again. Oh no! Here’s
<a href="https://traversefantasy.blogspot.com/">Marcia</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Just over a year ago, I heard whispers that Unconquered plagiarized
locations, encounters, and setting-elements from previous, more
prominent science-fantasy setting books: <em>Ultraviolet Grasslands and
the Black City</em> by Luka Rejec (2020), and <em>Vaults of Vaarn</em>
by Leo Hunt (2021). This was very frustrating on one hand, but I also
missed doing critical analysis of texts. Seeking justice and wanting to
exercise my little gray cells, I challenged myself to produce an
intensive comparison of these texts as well as a history of how
<em>Unconquered</em> developed. –
<a href="https://traversefantasy.blogspot.com/2023/12/plagiarism-in-unconquered-2022.html">Plagiarism
in Unconquered (2022)</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I read <a href="https://www.wizardthieffighter.com/">Luca</a>’s post on
the topic, too.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The broader solution, beyond any one case, is for all of us to promote,
encourage and celebrate artists and writers, designers and all the
people whose creativity inspires us. I know this from my experience and
heart. –
<a href="https://www.wizardthieffighter.com/2023/on-creative-theft/">On
Creative Theft</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That reminded me that I have a copy of the Ultraviolet Grasslands 1.8 on
my bookshelf. And I started reading again… It really is like a
<em>colour spray</em> spell cast right into your brain. I remember now
why I felt unable to run it. It was vague. It had inspiration but no
foundation. I wanted rooms, characters, quests, and this was just
pictures and words. But this time, it was different.
</p>
<p>
I had played and run some Classic Traveller. And as recently discussed
Traveller on the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/wiki/MontagInZ%c3%bcrich/2023-11-19_Traveller">Internet
Office Hours Podcast</a>, prep for a typical Traveller game might
involve an A5 page page of scribbling at most. Your ideas are being
generated as you fill the subsector with text. And my take-away was that
I needed more patrons in my game.
</p>
<p>
So… suddenly it seemed like playing Ultraviolet Grasslands was a go. It
wouldn’t be a game like the games I run with
<a href="Halberds_and_Helmets">Halberds &amp; Helmets</a> with a mapped
environment. I still have a bunch of non-player characters I prepare
ahead of time, with (some) stats and an agenda, but there is also a lot
of improvisation. There are daydreams of buildings and environments but
no exact maps.
</p>
<p>
I’m going to give this a try! Let’s play Ultraviolet Grasslands with
Fantasy Traveller – that is to say: <a href="Halberts">Halberts</a>. If

Embassy in Baghdad Attacked With 7 Mortars, No Casualties</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Approximately seven mortar rounds landed in the U.S. Embassy compound
in Baghdad during an attack early on Friday, a U.S. military official
told Reuters, in what appears to be one of the largest attacks against
the embassy in recent memory.</p>
<p>It also marked the first time the U.S. embassy had been fired on in
more than a year, apparently widening the range of targets after dozens
of attacks on military bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since
mid-October amid fears of broadening conflict in the region.</p>
<p>No group claimed responsibility, but previous attack against U.S.
forces have been carried out by Iran-aligned militias which have
targeted U.S. interests in Syria and Iraq over Washington’s backing for
Israel in its Gaza war.</p>
<p>The U.S. military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
left open the possibility that more projectiles were fired at the
embassy compound but did not land within it.</p>
<p>The official added that the attack caused very minor damage but no
injuries.</p>
<p>Explosions were heard near the embassy, in the center of the capital,
at about 4 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Friday. Sirens calling on people to take
cover were activated.</p>
<p>State media said the attack damaged the headquarters of an Iraqi
security agency.</p>
<p>The U.S. military official added that Ain al-Asad air base, which
hosts U.S. and other international forces in western Iraq, had also been
targeted but the projectiles did not land in the base.</p>
<p>Sheik Ali Damoush, a senior official in the Lebanese group Hezbollah,
said in a Friday sermon that attacks by Iran-aligned groups across the
Middle East aim to apply pressure for a halt to Israel’s offensive in
the Gaza Strip. He did not refer specifically to Friday’s attack.</p>
<p>The dozens of attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been
claimed by a group of Iran-aligned Shi’ite Muslim militias operating
under the banner of the Islamic Resistance in Iraq.</p>
<p>The U.S. has responded with a series of strikes that have killed at
least 15 militants in Iraq and up to seven in Syria.</p>
<p>‘Acts of terrorism’</p>
<p>The attacks pose a challenge for Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia
al-Sudani, who has pledged to protect foreign missions and capitalize on
fragile stability to focus on the economy and court foreign investment,
including from the United States.</p>
<p>Sudani directed security agencies to pursue the perpetrators,
describing them as “unruly, lawless groups that do not in any way
represent the will of the Iraqi people,” a statement from his office
said.</p>
<p>He also said that undermining Iraq’s stability, reputation and
targeting places Iraq has committed to protect were acts of
terrorism.</p>
<p>A U.S. embassy spokesperson called on the Iraqi government to do all
in its power to protect diplomatic and coalition personnel and
facilities.</p>
<p>“We reiterate that we reserve the right to self-defense and to
protect our personnel anywhere in the world,” he said.</p>
<p>Aside from its diplomatic staff in Iraq, the United States has about
2,500 troops in the country on a mission it says aims to advise and
assist local forces trying to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State,
which in 2014 seized large swathes of both countries before being
defeated.</p>
<p>Iran-aligned Houthis have been firing at Israel and ships in the Red
Sea in a campaign they say aims to support the Palestinians. U.S.
warships have shot down several of their projectiles.</p>

have bigger issues than Jeffrey Goldberg’s conscience. Why doesn’t NPR
and The Atlantic go out and find The Freaking Resistance and introduce
us to them. My grandfather said something to me when I was a little boy,
with such clarity, I can never forget it. He said David, when the Nazis
come (he was sure they would) you need to go up on the roof with a gun,
and shoot them. He knew. He didn’t say “David, run” or “David, write an

“If buying isn’t owning, piracy isn’t stealing” (08 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links “If buying isn’t owning, piracy isn’t stealing”: When
Big Content makes the paid version <em>worse</em> than the free one. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008,
2018, 2022. Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances,
current writing projects, current reading “If buying isn’t owning,
piracy isn’t stealing” (permalink) 20 years ago, I got in a (friendly)
public spat with Chris Anderson, who was then the editor in chief of
Wired. I’d publicly noted my disappointment with glowing Wired reviews
of DRM-encumbered digital devices, prompting Anderson to call me
unrealistic for expecting the magazine to condemn gadgets for their DRM:
https://longtail.typepad.com/the_long_tail/2004/12/is_drm_evil.html I
replied in public, telling him that he’d misunderstood. This wasn’t an
issue of ideological purity – it was about good reviewing practice.
Wired was telling readers to buy a product because it had features x, y
and z, but at any time in the future, without warning, without recourse,
the vendor could switch off any of those features:
https://memex.craphound.com/2004/12/29/cory-responds-to-wired-editor-on-drm/
I proposed that all Wired endorsements for DRM-encumbered products
should come with this disclaimer: WARNING: THIS DEVICE’S FEATURES ARE
SUBJECT TO REVOCATION WITHOUT NOTICE, ACCORDING TO TERMS SET OUT IN
SECRET NEGOTIATIONS. YOUR INVESTMENT IS CONTINGENT ON THE GOODWILL OF
THE WORLD’S MOST PARANOID, TECHNOPHOBIC ENTERTAINMENT EXECS. THIS DEVICE
AND DEVICES LIKE IT ARE TYPICALLY USED TO CHARGE YOU FOR THINGS YOU USED
TO GET FOR FREE — BE SURE TO FACTOR IN THE PRICE OF BUYING ALL YOUR
MEDIA OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AT NO TIME IN HISTORY HAS ANY ENTERTAINMENT
COMPANY GOTTEN A SWEET DEAL LIKE THIS FROM THE ELECTRONICS PEOPLE, BUT
THIS TIME THEY’RE GETTING A TOTAL WALK. HERE, PUT THIS IN YOUR MOUTH,
IT’LL MUFFLE YOUR WHIMPERS. Wired didn’t take me up on this suggestion.
But I was right. The ability to change features, prices, and
availability of things you’ve already paid for is a powerful temptation
to corporations. Inkjet printers were always a sleazy business, but once
these printers got directly connected to the internet, companies like HP
started pushing out “security updates” that modified your printer to
make it reject the third-party ink you’d paid for:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer
Now, this scam wouldn’t work if you could just put things back the way
they were before the “update,” which is where the DRM comes in. A
thicket of IP laws make reverse-engineering DRM-encumbered products into
a felony. Combine always-on network access with indiscriminate
criminalization of user modification, and the enshittification will
follow, as surely as night follows day. This is the root of all the
right to repair shenanigans. Sure, companies withhold access to
diagnostic codes and parts, but codes can be extracted and parts can be
cloned. The real teeth in blocking repair comes from the law, not the
tech. The company that makes McDonald’s wildly unreliable McFlurry
machines makes a fortune charging franchisees to fix these eternally
broken appliances. When a third party threatened this racket by
reverse-engineering the DRM that blocked independent repair, they got
buried in legal threats:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/04/20/euthanize-rentier-enablers/#cold-war
Everybody loves this racket. In Poland, a team of security researchers
at the OhMyHack conference just presented their teardown of the
anti-repair features in NEWAG Impuls locomotives. NEWAG boobytrapped
their trains to try and detect if they’ve been independently serviced,
and to respond to any unauthorized repairs by bricking themselves:
https://mamot.fr/<span class="citation"
data-cites="q3k">@q3k</span><span class="citation"
data-cites="hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453">@hackerspace.pl/111528162905209453</span>
Poland is part of the EU, meaning that they are required to uphold the
provisions of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive, including Article 6,
which bans this kind of reverse-engineering. The researchers are
planning to present their work again at the Chaos Communications
Congress in Hamburg this month – Germany is also a party to the EUCD.
The threat to researchers from presenting this work is real – but so is
the threat to conferences that host them:
https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/researchers-face-legal-threats-over-sdmi-hack/
20 years ago, Chris Anderson told me that it was unrealistic to expect
tech companies to refuse demands for DRM from the entertainment
companies whose media they hoped to play. My argument – then and now –
was that any tech company that sells you a gadget that can have its
features revoked is defrauding you. You’re paying for x, y and z – and
if they are contractually required to remove x and y on demand, they are
selling you something that you can’t rely on, without making that clear
to you. But it’s worse than that. When a tech company designs a device
for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades, they invite both
external and internal parties to demand those downgrades. Like Pavel
Chekov says, a phaser on the bridge in Act I is going to go off by Act
III. Selling a product that can be remote, irreversibly, nonconsensually
downgraded inevitably results in the worst person at the
product-planning meeting proposing to do so. The fact that there are no
penalties for doing so makes it impossible for the better people in that
meeting to win the ensuing argument, leading to the moral injury of
seeing a product you care about reduced to a pile of shit:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/25/moral-injury/#enshittification But
even if everyone at that table is a swell egg who wouldn’t dream of
enshittifying the product, the existence of a remote, irreversible,
nonconsensual downgrade feature makes the product vulnerable to external
actors who will demand that it be used. Back in 2022, Adobe informed its
customers that it had lost its deal to include Pantone colors in
Photoshop, Illustrator and other “software as a service” packages. As a
result, users would now have to start paying a monthly fee to see their
own, completed images. Fail to pay the fee and all the Pantone-coded
pixels in your artwork would just show up as black:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/28/fade-to-black/#trust-the-process
Adobe blamed this on Pantone, and there was lots of speculation about
what had happened. Had Pantone jacked up its price to Adobe, so Adobe
passed the price on to its users in the hopes of embarrassing Pantone?
Who knows? Who can know? That’s the point: you invested in Photoshop,
you spent money and time creating images with it, but you have no way to
know whether or how you’ll be able to access those images in the future.
Those terms can change at any time, and if you don’t like it, you can go
fuck yourself. These companies are all run by CEOs who got their MBAs at
Darth Vader University, where the first lesson is “I have altered the
deal, pray I don’t alter it further.” Adobe chose to design its software
so it would be vulnerable to this kind of demand, and then its customers
paid for that choice. Sure, Pantone are dicks, but this is Adobe’s
fault. They stuck a KICK ME sign to your back, and Pantone obliged. This
keeps happening and it’s gonna keep happening. Last week, Playstation
owners who’d bought (or “bought”) Warner TV shows got messages telling
them that Warner had walked away from its deal to sell videos through
the Playstation store, and so all the videos they’d paid for were going
to be deleted forever. They wouldn’t even get refunds (to be clear,
refunds would also be bullshit – when I was a bookseller, I didn’t get
to break into your house and steal the books I’d sold you, not even if I
left some cash on your kitchen table). Sure, Warner is an unbelievably
shitty company run by the single most guillotineable executive in all of
Southern California, the loathsome David Zaslav, who oversaw the merger
of Warner with Discovery. Zaslav is the creep who figured out that he
could make more money cancelling completed movies and TV shows and
taking a tax writeoff than he stood to make by releasing them:
https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership Imagine
putting years of your life into making a program – showing up on set at
5AM and leaving your kids to get their own breakfast, performing stunts
that could maim or kill you, working 16-hour days during the acute phase
of the covid pandemic and driving home in the night, only to have this
absolute turd of a man delete the program before anyone could see it,
forever, to get a minor tax advantage. Talk about moral injury! But
without Sony’s complicity in designing a remote, irreversible,
nonconsensual downgrade feature into the Playstation, Zaslav’s war on
art and creative workers would be limited to material that hadn’t been
released yet. Thanks to Sony’s awful choices, David Zaslav can break
into your house, steal your movies – and he doesn’t even have to leave a
twenty on your kitchen table. The point here – the point I made 20 years
ago to Chris Anderson – is that this is the foreseeable, inevitable
result of designing devices for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual
downgrades. Anyone who was paying attention should have figured that out
in the GW Bush administration. Anyone who does this today? Absolute
flaming garbage. Sure, Zaslav deserves to be staked out over and anthill
and slathered in high-fructose corn syrup. But save the next anthill for
the Sony exec who shipped a product that would let Zaslav come into your
home and rob you. That piece of shit knew what they were doing and they
did it anyway. Fuck them. Sideways. With a brick. Meanwhile, the studios
keep making the case for stealing movies rather than paying for them. As

id="hunter-biden-indicted-on-9-tax-charges-adding-to-gun-charges-in-special-counsel-investigation">Hunter
Biden Indicted on 9 Tax Charges, Adding to Gun Charges in Special
Counsel Investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hunter Biden was indicted on nine tax charges in California as a
special counsel investigation into the business dealings of President
Joe Biden’s son intensifies against the backdrop of the 2024
election.</p>
<p>The new charges filed Thursday — three felonies and six misdemeanors
— are in addition to federal firearms charges in Delaware alleging
Hunter Biden broke laws against drug users having guns in 2018. They
come after the implosion of a plea deal over the summer that would have
spared him jail time, putting the case on track to a possible trial as
his father campaigns for reelection.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden “spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle
rather than paying his tax bills,” special counsel David Weiss said in a
statement. The charges are centered on at least $1.4 million in taxes
Hunter Biden owed during between 2016 and 2019, a period where he has
acknowledged struggling with addiction. The back taxes have since been
paid.</p>
<p>If convicted, Hunter Biden, 53, could a maximum of 17 years in
prison. The special counsel probe remains open, Weiss said.</p>
<p>In a fiery response, defense attorney Abbe Lowell accused Weiss of
“bowing to Republican pressure” in the case.</p>
<p>“Based on the facts and the law, if Hunter’s last name was anything
other than Biden, the charges in Delaware, and now California, would not
have been brought,” Lowell said in a statement.</p>
<p>The White House declined to comment on Thursday’s indictment,
referring questions to the Justice Department or Hunter Biden’s personal
representatives.</p>
<p>The charging documents filed in California, where he lives, detail
spending on drugs, strippers, luxury hotels and exotic cars, “in short,
everything but his taxes,” prosecutor Leo Wise wrote.</p>
<p>The indictment comes as congressional Republicans pursue an
impeachment inquiry into President Biden, claiming he was engaged in an
influence-peddling scheme with his son. The House is expected to vote
next week on formally authorizing the inquiry.</p>
<p>No evidence has emerged so far to prove that Joe Biden, in his
current or previous office, abused his role or accepted bribes, though
questions have arisen about the ethics surrounding the Biden family’s
international business.</p>
<p>The separate, long-running criminal investigation into Hunter Biden
had been expected to wind down with a plea deal where he would have
gotten two years’ probation after pleading guilty to misdemeanor tax
charges and avoided prosecution on the gun charge if he stayed out of
trouble.</p>
<p>The agreement was pilloried as a “sweetheart deal” by Republicans,
including former President Donald Trump. Trump is facing his own
criminal cases, including charges that he plotted to overturn the
results of the 2020 election, which he lost to Biden, a Democrat.</p>
<p>Rep. James Comer, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, gave
credit for the new charges Thursday to two IRS investigators who
testified before Congress that the Justice Department had mishandled and
“slow walked” the investigation into the president’s son. Justice
officials have denied those allegations.</p>
<p>The two IRS employees, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, said the
indictment was “a complete vindication of our thorough
investigation.”</p>
<p>The new charges against Hunter Biden include filing a false return
and tax evasion felonies, as well as misdemeanor failure to file and
failure to pay.</p>
<p>The defense signaled that it plans to fight the new charges, likely
at least in part relying on immunity provisions from the original plea
deal. Defense attorneys have argued those remain in force since that
part of the agreement was signed by a prosecutor before the deal was
scrapped.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have disagreed, pointing out the documents weren’t signed
by a judge and are invalid.</p>
<p>Lowell said he’s also planning to push for dismissal of the gun
charges next week, calling them “unprecedented and
unconstitutional.”</p>
<p>The three federal gun charges filed in Delaware allege Hunter Biden
had lied about his drug use to buy a gun that he kept for 11 days in
2018. Federal law bans gun possession by “habitual drug users,” though
the measure is seldom seen as a stand-alone charge and has been called
into question by a federal appeals court.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s longstanding struggle with substance abuse worsened
after the death of his brother Beau Biden in 2015, according to court
documents and his memoir “Beautiful Things,” which ends with him getting
clean in 2019.</p>
<p>His gross income nevertheless totaled some $7 million between 2016
and 2020, prosecutors said, pointing to his roles on the board of the
Ukrainian energy company Burisma and a Chinese private equity fund as
well as his position at a law firm.</p>
<p>Hunter did eventually file his taxes in 2020, while facing a child
support case in Arkansas, and the back taxes were paid by a “third
party,” prosecutors have said in court documents.</p>

Threatens To Withdraw $100 million From University After Congressional
Hearing</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A University of Pennsylvania donor has threatened to withdraw a $100
million donation from The Wharton School, the university’s business
school, following the appearance of the university’s president before
Congress.</p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania President Elizabeth Magill appeared before
Congress Tuesday along with leaders of two other Ivy League schools -
Harvard President Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth of MIT.</p>
<p>During a hearing, none of the presidents answered “yes” or “no” to
the question: “Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your
university’s] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and
harassment?”</p>
<p>All three presidents told the panel that they did not condone
antisemitism and were taking steps to prevent it on campus, but on the
specific question they cited free speech rights and said any discipline
would depend on the specific circumstances.</p>
<p>Hate speech and acts — both antisemitic and Islamophobic — have
erupted on U.S. college campuses since the Hamas-Israel war began in
October.</p>
<p>All the presidents have received criticism because of their refusal
to give a definitive answer to the question.</p>
<p>Stone Ridge Asset Management CEO Ross Stevens says he will withdraw
his donation, now worth $100 million, to the Wharton School’s Stevens
Center for Innovation in Finance if Magill is not removed from
office.</p>

Remain Extremely Concerned About Climate Change, Heatmap Poll Finds</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDYzOTcyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NTI5OTIxMn0.w3qIp2CMWEvM5yslkjnRpK5S7zd7IKgb4AEtcgeZoSA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Americans remain immensely concerned about climate change, with 70%
calling it a serious problem and over one in three saying they are
extremely concerned about the issue, Heatmap’s second Climate Poll has
found, echoing results from its first survey last winter.
</p>
<p>
Conducted in mid-November by Benenson Strategy Group, the second poll
explored both how Americans’ perceptions of climate change have shifted
since <em>Heatmap</em>’s inaugural survey in February and also expanded
to touch on questions about individuals’ personal experiences with
climate change, their concerns about the future, their knowledge about
climate issues and their attitudes on solutions, and how the issue is
factoring into their 2024 presidential election decisions.
</p>
<p>
Encouragingly, the vast majority of Americans (68%) agree with the
scientific consensus that climate change is a result of human activity,
including almost half (48%) of Republicans and many (44%) former Trump
voters.

<p>
However, most people do not think that things are moving in the right
direction: 46% of respondents said they are “increasingly pessimistic”
about climate change, while only a quarter said they think things are
looking up.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While

intensifying hurricanes</a>, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/kaniela-ing-interview-maui-fire" target="_self">the
deadliest wildfire in modern history</a> made headlines throughout 2023,
Americans reported a slight decline from last winter in their feelings
of being personally affected by climate change: 44% said they were
“very” or “somewhat” affected, down 6 points since the Heatmap Climate
Poll was last conducted 10 months ago. The highest numbers came from
respondents in the West, about half (49%) of whom said they’d
experienced climate change personally, and the lowest numbers were in
the Midwest, with 37% who said they’d been affected.
</p>
<p>
However, that has not affected Americans’ sense of urgency or concern
about future weather impacts on their communities. Of the extreme
weather scenarios that <em>Heatmap</em> asked about — tornadoes, extreme
thunderstorms, hurricanes, wildfires, drought, flooding, extreme heat,
and blizzards — a majority of Americans said they had concerns about the
climate impacting the place they live. The lowest level of reported
anxiety was over hurricanes (57%), which makes sense given that the
impacts are heavily (albeit,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/future-floods-california-hilary?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self">sometimes
surprisingly</a>) regional.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="f878750d220449e44113cd725fd30308" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="ec258" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcyNDY0OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNTA3ODYzOX0.jfdlXUumEYx0g6MeXUfgOnqqvqxBYaEPLHGhzO9FFfQ/image.png?width=980"/>
</p>
<p>
These concerns played into Americans’ thoughts about the future more
generally as well. Nearly three-quarters of parents (72%) reported
having high levels of concern about the climate, with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/rise-of-the-climate-dads" target="_self">dads</a>
slightly more worried (77%) than moms (68%).<br/>
</p>
<p>
More than one in 10 Americans (12%) are worried that insurance companies
are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/why-insurance-companies-are-fleeing-florida" target="_self">leaving
their area</a>. Almost one in five Americans (19%) say they’ve already
seen their insurance rates increase due to weather extremes, and eight
in 10 Americans say they want the government to require insurance
companies to continue offering insurance in areas that are affected by
climate change.
</p>
<p>
Most respondents said they are taking personal action on some level,
whether it’s recycling (70%), carrying a reusable water bottle (62%), or
driving or hoping to drive an EV in the future (46%). Even among people
who voted in 2020 for Trump —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-trashed-electric-cars-instead-of-going-to-the-gop-debate" target="_self">no
fan of electric vehicles</a> — 30% said they drive or would like to
drive an electric car in the future.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to solutions, though, Americans are more divided on the
best approach. There’s uncertainty around the green energy transition,
with 38% of respondents worried it will cost them money, 35% believing
it will save them money, and 27% unsure. Proposals like providing tax
incentives to make homes more energy efficient; making it
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/renewables-nimby-poll-solar-wind" target="_self">easier</a>
to build new solar plants; investing in public transportation; and
funding scientific studies to explore ways of reducing the amount of
carbon in the atmosphere are widely popular, though, with all receiving
over 80% support by respondents.
</p>
<p>
However, Americans who currently drive, or are interested in buying, an
EV largely said that fuel savings (73%) were a bigger incentive to them
than the benefits for the climate (63%). Starkly, Americans are also not
sold on
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-fossil-fuels-phaseout" target="_self">the
phase-out of fossil fuels</a>: 62% said they support making it easier to
drill and build new pipelines, including 51% of Democrats and 59% of
Independents.

What does the picture painted by the <em>Heatmap</em> poll mean for the
2024 election? There is a clear bipartisan interest in climate change,
with 68% of Americans saying a candidate’s position on climate change is
important in determining their presidential vote, including 86% of
Democrats, 53% of Republicans, and 62% of Independents. Additionally,
nearly one in seven (69%) Americans said they would be more likely to
vote for a candidate that led an initiative to plant millions of trees
to remove carbon from the atmosphere — a
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/08/02/trillion-trees-republicans-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">popular,
albeit dubious, Republican climate proposal</a> that 80% of Democrats
said they could get behind.

results in the coming days, including closer looks at Americans’
understandings of climate lingo, how they are influenced by common land
development arguments, and more<strong>.</strong>

Benenson Strategy Group via online panels from Nov. 6 to 13, 2023. The

</p>
<p>
The Paris Agreement, the 2015 treaty significant for uniting almost
every country in the world in supporting a common strategy to address
climate change, was
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2015/dec/16/how-a-typo-nearly-derailed-the-paris-climate-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">almost
scuttled</a> by an argument over whether nations “should” cut emissions
or “shall” do it. This year,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-fossil-fuels-phaseout" target="_self">delegates
are at odds</a> over whether the world should “phase down” or “phase
out” fossil fuels, and whether to allow for “abated” fossil fuels, a
euphemism for the use of carbon capture technologies that prevent
emissions from entering the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
To explain the significance of these debates, the media often points to
the scientific consensus that the world must reach “net zero” to achieve
the goals of the Paris Agreement. But does anyone know what we’re
talking about?
</p>
<p>
Heatmap’s second Climate Poll, conducted in mid-November by Benenson
Strategy Group, found that the “Paris Agreement,” “Net Zero,” and a
number of other terms used by activists, politicians, and climate
communicators, are still unfamiliar to the majority of Americans.
</p>
<p>
One thousand adults, ages 18 and up, were asked, “In the context of
climate change, sustainability and environmental responsibility, how
familiar are you with the following terms?”
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="86702c52c2469b1809e6a202a04c5ea0" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="7a604" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcyNDU2OC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzQ0NDExMn0.w9snGulVl31YxL3bvnvdz8-tMiVwmrlJRAWQvBHMN9Q/image.png?width=980"/>
</p>
<p>
The results are not exactly surprising. It makes sense that people would
be far more familiar with mature technologies like solar, wind, and
nuclear, than with terms like “green hydrogen” and “direct air capture,”
which are much newer to the conversation and barely exist at scale in
the real world yet.<br/>
</p>
<p>
When I ran the findings by Jonathon Schuldt, an associate professor at
Cornell University who studies public opinion on health and
environmental issues, he agreed that they reflect “the effect of time
and exposure” to these terms among the public. “Solar, wind, and nuclear
energy have been part of the mainstream discourse for many decades,” he
said, “even before terms like global warming and climate change.” To
prove it, Schuldt showed me the results of running the terms through the
Google Books Ngram Viewer, which identifies their prevalence in books
over time:<br/>
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="7d3096dd5c11819b2e2bf1d553e33d1c" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="66c41" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDY4NDUxMS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODQzNzA0Nn0.5Q2j_N-PjnP8TlpGldBIaYAmGsytJjkVayM9JD5VoAA/image.png?width=980"/>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Google

</p>
<p>
But now, the reality on the ground in the U.S. is changing rapidly. The
Biden administration is pouring more than $10 billion dollars into
deploying green hydrogen plants and direct air capture machines at
various sites around the country as a result of two major climate
packages passed in 2021 and 2022, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and
the Inflation Reduction Act. Even as these two pieces of legislation
have reshaped the energy and climate discussion in the U.S. in the last
two years, public familiarity with green hydrogen and direct air capture
appears to have remained static. Our findings line up very closely with
a
<a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/memos/carbon-removal-polling.pdf" target="_blank">similar
poll conducted by Data for Progress</a> in May 2021. While both
solutions hold a lot of promise to reduce climate change, they come with
many more risks and trade-offs than solar or wind.
</p>
<p>
In general, we found that more Democrats were familiar with the terms on
the list than Republicans. But slightly more Republicans expressed
familiarity with “ESG” (40% vs 35%) “nuclear energy,” (71% vs 70%) “wind
energy,” (77% vs 75%), “the IPCC 1.5C report” (22% vs 21%) and “Paris
agreement” (38% vs 35%).
</p>
<p>
More men also expressed knowledge of the terms than women in every
category.
</p>
<p>
There was also a significant gap between Americans below and above the
age of 50, with younger generations far more likely to know terms like
“environmental justice,” “carbon removal,” and “the IPCC 1.5C report.”
</p>
<p>
We also found a correlation between people who said that they had been
personally affected by climate change and knowledge of key climate
concepts. About three times as many people who had been affected by
climate change knew what “green hydrogen” or a “direct air capture
plant” was, compared with those who said they had not been affected by
climate change.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="d953289e777cf437261a84128c80c0f9" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="d2755" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcyNDU3NS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxODIwNTk0N30.7MDb2o42HQDVa4c1LpM2a1tM4G-CNnPP55rA8flDzrg/image.png?width=980"/>
</p>
<p>
“A key question is whether familiarity corresponds to support,” Schuldt
told me. “Especially given COP28’s emphasis on the need to shift to
renewable energy. On the other hand, that most respondents were
unfamiliar with central terms like environmental justice and net zero
suggests that the climate movement has more work to do when it comes to
engaging the general public in these conversations.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
Well, Heatmap asked about support, too, for at least a few of these. And
while solar and wind do have significant support, some of the results
are a bit contradictory to the familiarity findings, because far more
people said they would support the Paris Agreement and environmental
justice than admitted they knew what these phrases meant. (The added
context probably helped too.)

We went a lot deeper on some of these questions, especially around
support for renewable energy, and will have more to share with you in
the coming weeks.<br/>

<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is the 15th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where
I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today
we have Eli Mellen and his blog,
<a href="https://eli.li" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Oatmeal</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was introduced to Eli’s blog by

Haywood</a>,
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/pb-piper-haywood">previously
featured on the series</a>, and loved the “tumblrness” of his digital
home. That’s a terrible description but still, if you used tumblr before
you probably understand what I’m talking about.

<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Hi, I’m Eli. I live on the coast of Maine in the US with my family and a
number of pets. I have a weird background in literary theory, art
history, philosophy, animation and design, but backed my way into a
career as an approximately programmer-shaped person. I’ve worked as a
software architect, QA lead, accessibility specialist and product
manager. These days I do that sorta stuff in the civic tech space. I
love to <a href="https://eli.li/2023-reading-list">read</a>, play
SNES-era jrpgs, cook vegetarian food, and wander around outside with my
kids.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’ve had some iteration of my website at my current domain name since
the spring of 2013. Before that, though, I also had various
(embarrassing) tumblrs and livejournals. I’ve written online, for good
and ill, for as long as I’ve been online. The first iteration of my
current website was born a bit out of desperation and hubris. I thought
being online could land me a job. It was also a space where I could
teach myself more about web hosting and development.
</p>
<p>
I was freshly out of undergrad, and was barreling my way out of graduate
school with a family on the way. I’d always dabbled with technology and
programming, even though I hadn’t studied it in school, so it seemed
like a good place to look for work. The internet world was all Bootstrap
and Ruby on Rails at the time, so I dove deep into those things, and
everything else that seemed hip at the time. I guess my hope was to blog
so good that I got a job? And, it sort of worked out in that my website
became a playground for me to learn technical skills that would
eventually help me be employable.
</p>
<p>
Everything has changed a lot over the years. Around 2018 I got really
excited about the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indieweb</a> and
rebuilt my website to support all the indieweb functionality I could
cram into my homespun CMS. At that point things took a turn towards
microblogging — quick, short posts without titles — so, I did that on my
website.
</p>
<p>
These days my setup is simpler. I’ve removed all the
<a href="https://eli.li/tagged/indieweb">indieweb features</a>, like
<a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmentions</a> and use a
content management system called <a href="https://blot.im/">blot</a> to
publish plaintext as pretty well formatted HTML, with an RSS feed.
</p>
<p>
My domain name is entirely uncreative. I wanted the shortest, yet most
affordable thing I could find, and my name happened to work out.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I wish I had an elegant answer. Something about going for a swim in a
mountain lake, then sitting on the floor with a beautiful notebook and
drafting an initial sketch of a thing while a concerto plays softly in
the background, leaf-dappled light filling the minimal, wood-hewn space.
</p>
<p>
In reality I’m more of a goblin than that. I tend to bang things out
over breaks, or in little spare windows of time.
</p>
<p>
I have a drafts folder filled with dozens of long form things, partially
researched and mostly unfinished. What gets posted to my website these
days tends to be the quicker stuff. Photos and things I write on my
phone or directly on my desktop, then read through once or twice before
I share them.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I think I do have an ideal creative environment, I don’t think I’ve
discovered it yet. Reading a lot helps me feel creative, as does
listening to music. When I’m in a rut I usually pick up a book.
</p>
<p>
I have a strange relationship with technology. As a person who “does
tech” for a job, I really really loathe most technology. I find it
cumbersome and not something I wanna give attention to, so, these days I
seek out things that get out of my way, support the accessibility
features I need, and that won’t require heaps of my attention after
setting them up.
</p>
<p>
Because of this I end up using a lot of default, or barebones,
applications. Almost all my blog posts are composed in macOS’ default
TextEdit application. If I’m writing something longer than a normal
post, or writing code I’ll reach for either
<a href="https://eli.li/acme">Acme</a> or Emacs.
</p>
<p>
I like a clicky keyboard, but don’t have strong opinions about which
ones, or types of keys.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The tech stack has changed a number of times. Originally my website was
totally static, hosted with GitHub pages. I used a variety of static
site generators there, including a few I made myself. For the hottest of
seconds I used Wordpress hosted on a VPS, but I quickly became
frustrated with how limiting that felt, and tore it all down to write my
own CMS. That CMS took a few forms, in a few languages, but was mostly a
PHP monstrosity that supported
<a href="https://micropub.spec.indieweb.org/">micropub</a> for creating
and editing posts.
</p>
<p>
These days I use <a href="http://blot.im">blot.im</a> — my website is a
pile of directories and plaintext files on my computer that get synced
to blot automatically. It is pretty magical. I built a custom theme for
blot that I
<a href="https://eli.li/2023/02/11/accessibility-updates">recently
updated to make more accessible</a>. Blot is one of the very few
legitimately great web services I’ve ever used.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
If I was starting again today, I think I would do a few things
differently:
</p>
<p>
I would consider blogging anonymously, or more disconnected from my
lived life. The hope would be that would let me feel cozier being more
weird (I’m excited about a weirder, quieter internet).
</p>
<p>
I would lean away from the chronological timeline as the primary
organizing mechanism of the website, and have better URLs without dates
in them.
</p>
<p>
I have a <a href="https://eli.li/wiki">wiki</a> section these days, and
like how that invites me to revisit stuff I’ve written, keeping it
up-to-date and alive in a way that the chronological timeline doesn’t.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I make, and have made exactly $0 from my website to date. I’ve no plans
to try and monetize it. I have no clue how many folks read my site. I’ve
never had analytics or anything of the sort.
</p>
<p>
I pay $20/year for my CMS, and $25/year for my domain name.
</p>
<p>
I’ve got no qualms with folks monetizing their websites, especially when
they’re upfront about it. I’ve thought about it before, but nothing more
than fancifully thinking “it’d be nice to work less and play more.”
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Oh! So many!
</p>
<p>
I keep a <a href="https://eli.li/blogroll">blogroll</a> of personal
sites that I enjoy. Two great sites that I find really inspiring are
<a href="http://maya.land">maya.land</a> and
<a href="https://notes.billmill.org/">Bill Mill’s notes blog</a>. I
think they’d each make for fascinating interviews!
</p>
<p>
I love the writing, and sprawling topics across
<a href="http://maya.land">maya.land</a>, and I dig how Bill’s website
leans more personal tool than personal website. I used to
<a href="https://eli.li/tagged/like">post a ton of links</a> to my
website, but was never as organized about it.
</p>
<p>
I also love to explore spaces like
<a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/">Marginalia</a> and the
<a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/">Merveilles webring</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Thanks for this opportunity and for maintaining this awesome project!

</p>
<p>
Supposedly, one day, I’ll either share a video game or some fiction I’ve
created. Those will land on my website when that time comes, but for now
I have a <a href="https://eli.li/shout-outs">shout outs page</a> on my
website. I update that with stuff that I think is worth shouting out.

Yearning for the pre-web internet can be misplaced… it certainly wasn’t

Long before the internet became our world, there was a mishmash of
online services such as AOL, CompuServe, GEnie, and Prodigy. Except for
being faster, there’s less difference between then and now than you
might think. …

<h2 id="it-was-a-big-week-for-weird-little-evs">It Was a Big Week for
Weird Little EVs</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcwNzQ4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNTMzMDIxMn0.XvbKb1bWhrYalOOnGhdW2Q04PQ0fPEDL7jila-KbpFc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Americanization of electric cars is in full swing, with every U.S.
automaker doing what it does best: building ever larger, heavier, and
more spacious vehicles. So it’s refreshing to see Stellantis, the parent
company of Fiat, bringing its first new EV to the States in the form of
a reborn
<a href="https://www.fiatusa.com/500e-reveal.html" target="_blank">500e</a>.

</p>
<p>
The 500e was beloved when it first landed a decade ago, providing a
quick, ultra-compact hatchback that fit the needs of most city and
suburban drivers. And given there weren’t exactly a lot of small,
inexpensive EV options at the time (and incentives were plentiful), you
still see them on the road today.
</p>
<p>
For the new model, Fiat addressed
<a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a46031505/2024-fiat-500e-ev-revealed/" target="_blank">this
week</a> some of the issues of its predecessor, with a boost in both
power and range thanks to a 42 kWh battery pack that wrings out 149
miles on a charge. The $34,000
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/fiat/500e" target="_blank">price
tag</a> may not make it the bargain it used to be, particularly compared
to more spacious and long-range options like the Tesla Model 3, which,
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/want-a-small-cheap-ev-the-fiat-500e-is-coming-to-the-us-in-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unlike</a>
the 500e, is also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2023?rebelltitem=6#rebelltitem6" target="_self">eligible</a>
for a federal tax credit. But Fiat includes a free Level 2 home charger
in the deal, and its 3,000-pound weight and diminutive size make a
compelling case for the average commuter.
</p>
<p>
Plus, when it’s trundling along at low speeds, the 500e’s Acoustic
Vehicle Alert System (that low hum you hear that’s required on EVs)
plays a little Italian concerto, “The Sound of 500.”
</p>
<p>
If that’s not enough personality for you, one of the most storied
British sports car brands, Morgan,
<a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1141658_morgan-xp1-electric-sports-car-chases-aptera" target="_blank">unveiled
Wednesday</a> an electric update to its iconic three-wheeler. With a
33kWh battery pack mounted in the front and an electric motor putting
out 134 horsepower to the rear wheel — singular
—<a href="https://morgan-motor.com/news-xp-1/" target="_blank"> the
XP-1</a> is a glimpse of the ultimate electric urban runabout.

<p>
Completely developed in house by Morgan, it’s the company’s first
serious foray into electric motoring, with an aim to get about 100 miles
on a charge. At just over 1,500 pounds, the XP-1 is a scant 130 pounds
heavier than its internal combustion counterpart, providing the kind of
performance and raw driving experience Morgan is known for. Granted, the
lack of a roof limits its four-season functionality, but no one has ever
accused a Morgan of being sensible.

<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;In 2015, the world&amp;#8217;s governments declared a collective ambition: to limit the rise in global temperatures to just 1.5 degrees Celsius. Since then, two things have become clear. First, the costs of exceeding that threshold are greater than believed eight years ago. Second, the goal looks increasingly difficult to reach. Even if governments enact all the climate policies they&amp;#8217;ve so far announced &amp;#8212; an optimistic assumption &amp;#8212; warming this century is on track to exceed 2C and might run as high as 2.9C. As 70,000 politicians, officials and interested parties gather in Dubai for COP28 &amp;#8212; two weeks of talks to review what&amp;#8217;s been done and still needs to be done &amp;#8212; this failure to align policies with promises should remain front of mind. BloombergNEF is watching 10 areas where progress in Dubai can be measured against identifiable targets. As the meeting began, the expected score across all these initiatives was 3.9 out of 10. Likely progress on the overarching objective &amp;#8212; to get global carbon emissions in sync with the 1.5C ambition by 2030 &amp;#8212; was a pitiful 1 out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

Split on Whether Trump Would Be ‘Dictator’ if Reelected</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As part of his campaign for a second term as U.S. president, Donald
Trump and his allies say the former president — if he wins — would use
federal law enforcement to punish his political enemies and restructure
the federal government to streamline implementation of his policies.</p>
<p>While Democrats have been virtually unanimous in their concerns about
a second Trump presidency, warning that it would be tantamount to a
“dictatorship,” the reaction among Republicans has been sharply
divergent. Some in the Republican Party are raising an alarm, while
others downplay Trump’s rhetoric, suggesting that concerns about it are
overblown.</p>
<p>A key distinction, though, is that most of the Republicans expressing
concerns about Trump’s authoritarian tendencies are either no longer in
office or have announced their retirement, which suggests that
resistance to the former president’s expressed preferences may not be a
tenable position in the modern-day Republican Party.</p>
<p>Revenge and retribution</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Trump has promised his supporters that he will be
their “retribution” if he retakes the White House, and has used language
reminiscent of the worst of European fascism in the 1930s and 1940s,
calling his political opponents “vermin” and warning that immigrants are
“poisoning the blood” of the United States.</p>
<p>Trump has also expressed interest in reclassifying broad swaths of
the federal workforce — tens of thousands of career civil servants — as
“Schedule F” employees whom he could fire at will. A coalition of
conservative think tanks, spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, is
currently “vetting” thousands of Trump supporters who are interested in
serving in a second Trump administration and who could be expected to
faithfully carry out his wishes.</p>
<p>Trump has also promised to take specific steps, including “going
after” President Joe Biden and his family with a “special prosecutor,”
and has suggested that news outlets critical of him should be
silenced.</p>
<p>Trump’s closest supporters have echoed his threats. In an interview
with former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon this week, Kash
Patel, a former Defense Department official during the Trump
administration, said that in a second Trump term, “We will go out and
find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media …</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied
about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections
— we’re going to come after you. Whether it’s criminally or civilly,
we’ll figure that out.”</p>
<p>“This is just not rhetoric,” Bannon added. “We’re absolutely dead
serious.”</p>
<p>A one-day dictator?</p>
<p>As recently as Tuesday in a Fox News interview with Sean Hannity,
Trump was given the opportunity to allay concerns that he would behave
like a dictator if reelected.</p>
<p>“To be clear, do you in any way have any plans whatsoever if
reelected president, to abuse power, to break the law, to use the
government to go after people?” Hannity asked.</p>
<p>“You mean like they’re using right now?” Trump replied, and did not
answer the question.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Hannity tried again, “Under no circumstances,
you are promising America tonight, you would never abuse power as
retribution against anybody?”</p>
<p>“We love this guy,” Trump replied. “He says, ‘You’re not going to be
a dictator, are you?’ I said, ’No, no, no. Other than Day One. We’re
closing the border, and we’re drilling, drilling, drilling. After that,
I’m not a dictator. OK?”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to an emailed request asking for
clarification of his remarks.</p>
<p>Republicans issue warnings</p>
<p>In the Republican presidential primary debate on Wednesday, former
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie painted a dire picture of what he
thinks another Trump presidency would look like.</p>
<p>“This is an angry, bitter man who now wants to be back as president
because he wants to exact retribution on anyone who has disagreed with
him, anyone who has tried to hold him to account for his own conduct,
and every one of these policies that he’s talking about are about
pursuing a plan of retribution,” Christie said.</p>
<p>“Do I think he was kidding when he said he was a dictator?” Christie
continued. “All you have to do is look at the history, and that’s why
failing to speak out against him, making excuses for him, pretending
that somehow he’s a victim empowers him. …</p>
<p>“Let me make it clear: His conduct is unacceptable. He’s unfit. And
be careful of what you’re going to get if you ever got another Donald
Trump term. He’s letting you know, ‘I am your retribution.’”</p>
<p>Trump was not on the stage, having declined to participate in any of
the primary debates. The other three Republicans on the debate stage,
former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, Florida Governor Ron
DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, avoided any sharp criticism of
the former president, who retains a commanding lead in polls of likely
primary voters.</p>
<p>‘Sleepwalking into a dictatorship’</p>
<p>Christie’s concerns have been echoed by other Republicans such as
Utah Senator and 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who told The
Washington Post this week that Trump’s base seems to want him to behave
like an authoritarian.</p>
<p>“His base loves the authoritarian streak,” Romney said. “I think they
love the idea that he may use the military in domestic matters, and that
he will seek revenge and retribution. That’s why he’s saying it and has
the lock, nearly, on the Republican nomination.” In September, Romney
announced that he will not be running for reelection next year.</p>
<p>Former Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, who has been a vocal critic
of Trump and served on the House panel that investigated the January 6,
2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, told CBS News last weekend that she
has no doubts about what a second Trump presidency would look like.</p>
<p>“One of the things that we see happening today is sort of
sleepwalking into a dictatorship in the United States,” she said.</p>
<p>Not a serious threat</p>
<p>Current Republican officeholders who are supportive of the former
president often downplay his suggestion that he will use the levers of
governmental power to punish his critics.</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s debate, for example, DeSantis dismissed concerns
about Trump behaving as an authoritarian during a second term.</p>
<p>“Look, the media’s making a big deal about what he said about some of
these comments,” he said. “I would just remind people that is not how he
governed.”</p>
<p>Senator Lindsey Graham has said publicly he believes Trump’s comments
to Hannity were meant to be “funny.” In an interview with CNN on Sunday,
Graham disputed Cheney’s assertions about how Trump will behave in
office, saying they stem from her personal animosity toward the former
president.</p>
<p>“I think a continuation of the Biden presidency would be a disaster
for peace and prosperity at home and abroad,” Graham said. “Our border
is broken. The only person who is really going to fix a broken border is
Donald Trump. When he was president, none of this stuff was going on in
Ukraine. Hamas and all these other terrorist groups were afraid of
Trump.”</p>
<p>Asked to comment on Trump’s statement that he would be a one-day
dictator, Republican Senator Thom Tillis said, “He said he would do two
things: He would close the border and drill. Everybody could say that’s
abusing power. I think that’s a righteous use of power, and President
Biden’s failed on it.”</p>
<p>‘Autocrats always tell you who they are’</p>
<p>Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor at New York University and author of
“Strongmen: From Mussolini to the Present,” warned against the danger of
dismissing Trump’s rhetoric as unserious or flippant.</p>
<p>“Everything Donald Trump says should be taken seriously,” she wrote
in an email exchange with VOA. “Autocrats always tell you who they are
and what they are going to do. In this case, Trump is saying clearly he
has aspirations to be a dictator, which is unsurprising given his
incitement of a coup to stay in office illegally and given his open
adulation of others of his tribe such as [Russian President Vladimir]
Putin and [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping].”</p>
<p>Kurt Braddock, an assistant professor of Communications at American
University who studies the connection between political language and
violence, said that downplaying Trump’s rhetoric allows much of what the
former president says to become “normalized” with the general
public.</p>
<p>“They’ve been saying he’s ‘just joking’ for seven years now,”
Braddock told VOA. “And whether he’s just joking or not is immaterial as
far as I’m concerned. People interpret it, or some segment of the
population interprets it, as being truthful.”</p>
<p>“When there’s a population that admires somebody as much as some
individuals admire Trump, the normalization of this kind of language
promotes positive attitudes about the kinds of things it implies,”
Braddock said.</p>
<p>“So if he jokes about being a dictator, or jokes about implied
violence against political enemies, the more he does that the more it
kind of becomes part of our normal vocabulary.”</p>

Deals with Allies Signal Concerns Over China’s Disinformation
Campaign</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Western foreign policy experts are welcoming recent U.S. agreements
to jointly tackle foreign disinformation with Seoul and Tokyo, saying
they are needed to counter Chinese efforts to undermine liberal
democracies through the spread of fake news.</p>
<p>The U.S. signed a Memorandum of Cooperation with Japan in Tokyo on
Wednesday “to identify and counter foreign information manipulation,”
according to a State Department statement.</p>
<p>The agreement follows a Memorandum of Understanding signed with South
Korea in Seoul on Friday to cooperate in their efforts to tackle foreign
disinformation. The agreements, the first designed to fight
disinformation, were made during an Asia trip by Liz Allen, the U.S.
undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs.</p>
<p>They are designed to “demonstrate the seriousness with which the
United States is working with its partners to defend the information
space,” according to the State Department’s Wednesday statement, which
did not specify any nations as threats.</p>
<p>In response, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in
Washington, told VOA on Tuesday that he wants to stress that “China
always opposes the creation and spread of disinformation.”</p>
<p>He said, “What I have seen is that there is a lot of disinformation
about China on social media in the U.S. Some U.S. officials, lawmakers,
media and organizations have produced and spread a large amount of false
information against China without any evidence, ignoring basic
facts.”</p>
<p>The agreements the U.S. made with its allies are “a deliberate
acknowledgment of the threats posed by China,” said David Maxwell, vice
president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy.</p>
<p>“Disinformation is part of a deliberate long-term political warfare
campaign by China to subvert the democracies of the U.S., the ROK and
Japan as well as to undermine the alliance relationships to prevent
unified action against China,” Maxwell said, using the acronym for South
Korea’s official name, Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>China is seemingly accelerating its social media operation aimed at
influencing the U.S. election in 2024.</p>
<p>Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced on Nov. 30
that it took down 4,789 Facebook accounts based in China that were
impersonating Americans, including politicians, and posting messages
about U.S. politics and U.S.-China relations.</p>
<p>In the report on adversarial threats, Meta said China is the
third-most-common source of foreign disinformation after Russia and
Iran.</p>
<p>Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China
Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University, said, “The Chinese,
Russians, and others seek to disrupt the normal give and take of our
political discourse.”</p>
<p>Wilder, formerly National Security Council director for China in
2004-05 during the George W. Bush administration, continued to say the
agreements Washington made with Seoul and Tokyo are “a significant step
forward” as “democracies must work together” to offset “disinformation
designed to influence electorate and sow overall dissent within our open
political systems.”</p>
<p>Beijing appears to be spreading anti-U.S. and pro-China messages in
South Korea as well.</p>
<p>South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) announced Nov. 13
it had identified and taken down 38 fake Korean-language news sites
operated by two Chinese public relations firms, Haimai and Haixun.</p>
<p>South Korea’s National Cyber Security Center, which is overseen by
NIS, released a report on the same day describing the kind of propaganda
that the firms disseminated through the fake news sites by posing as
members of the Korean Digital News Association. The organization
oversees the copyrights of news articles posted by its members.</p>
<p>Using news site names such as Seoul Press with the corresponding
domain name as seoulpr.com and Busan Online with busanonline.com, Haimai
has been disseminating disinformation and operating the sites from
China, according to the report. Busan is South Korea’s second-largest
city.</p>
<p>An article on Daegu Journal, another illicit site Haimai was running,
stated in June that nuclear wastewater released from Japan would affect
the South Korean food supply chain.</p>
<p>The National Cyber Security Center report also noted that U.S.-based
cybersecurity firm Mandiant, owned by Google, released a report in July
accusing Haimai of operating 72 fraudulent websites to spread anti-U.S.
messages.</p>
<p>Cho Han-Bum, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for
National Unification, told VOA’s Korean Service on Tuesday that “China
and North Korea have been attempting in various ways to influence South
Korea’s public opinion.”</p>
<p>He said the influence campaign could affect South Korean politics and
therefore Seoul’s relations with Beijing or its stance on Pyongyang.</p>
<p>Kim Hyungjin in Seoul contributed to this report.</p>

id="mortality-rate-higher-for-black-moms-than-white-moms-in-mississippi-study-says">Mortality
Rate Higher for Black Moms Than White Moms in Mississippi, Study
Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Black people make up about 38% of Mississippi’s population, but a new
study shows that Black women were four times more likely to die of
causes directly related to pregnancy than white women in the state in
2020.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that this racial inequity is not only recognized,
but that concerted efforts are made at the institutional, community, and
state levels to reduce these disparate outcomes,” wrote Dr. Michelle
Owens and Dr. Courtney Mitchell, leaders of the Maternal Mortality
Review Committee that conducted the study.</p>
<p>The Mississippi State Department of Health published the findings
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The committee said 80% of pregnancy-related deaths in Mississippi
between 2016 and 2020 were considered preventable, and cardiovascular
disease and hypertension remain top contributors to maternal
mortality.</p>
<p>Women need comprehensive primary care before, during and after
pregnancy, but many people live in areas where health care services are
scarce, Owens and Mitchell wrote.</p>
<p>“A substantial portion of this care is being shouldered by smaller
hospitals with limited resources, many of whom are facing possible
closure and limiting or discontinuing the provision of obstetrical
services, further increasing the burdens borne by the individuals and
their communities,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The Maternal Mortality Review Committee was formed in 2017, and its
members include physicians, nurses, public health experts and others who
work in health care.</p>
<p>The committee found that from 2016 to 2020, Mississippi’s
pregnancy-related mortality rate was 35.2 deaths per 100,000 live
births. The study did not provide a comparable five-year number for the
U.S. but said the national rate was 20.1 deaths per 100,000 live births
in 2019 and 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2020.</p>
<p>Mississippi has long been one of the poorest states in the U.S., with
some of the highest rates of obesity and heart disease.</p>
<p>A state health department program called Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies
offers care management and home visits for pregnant women and for
infants who are at risk of having health problems.</p>
<p>“Losing one mother is too many,” Dr. Daniel Edney, the state health
officer, said in a news release about the maternal mortality study.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that Mississippi leaders expand Medicaid to
people who work in lower-wage jobs that don’t provide private health
insurance — a policy proposal that Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has long
opposed.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Reeves signed a law allowing postpartum Medicaid
coverage for a full year, up from two months.</p>
<p>Medicaid expansion is optional under the health care overhaul that
then-President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010, and Mississippi is
one of 10 states that have not taken the option. The non-expansion
states have Republican governors, Republican-controlled Legislatures or
both.</p>
<p>“Medicaid expansion should be incorporated for rural hospitals to
remain open and include access to telehealth services,” the Maternal
Mortality Review Committee leaders wrote. “There is a need for rural
healthcare facilities to provide higher levels of critical care, recruit
and retain adequate providers, and have access to life saving equipment,
especially in the most vulnerable areas of the state.”</p>
<p>The study examined deaths that occurred during or within one year
after pregnancy. It defined pregnancy-related deaths as those “initiated
by pregnancy, or the aggravation of an unrelated condition by the
physiologic effects of pregnancy” and pregnancy-associated deaths as
those “from a cause that is not related to pregnancy.”</p>
<p>Pregnancy-related deaths during the five years included 17 homicides
and four suicides, plus 26 instances of substance abuse disorder
contributing to the maternal death and 30 instances of mental health
conditions other than substance abuse disorder contributing to a
death.</p>
<p>The study also said obesity contributed to 32 maternal deaths and
discrimination contributed to 22. It noted that some pregnancy-related
deaths could have more than one contributing factor.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that health care providers develop
procedures and training to address maternal patients with severe
complaints for the same health concern, including training to eliminate
bias or discrimination.</p>

<p>The Biden administration is running out of time to secure a deal on

he is willing to compromise on Republicans’ demands on border security

Biden’s proposal. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara reports.

<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>HP knows people have grown to hate printers. It even knows that
people hate HP printers. But based on a new marketing campaign the
company launched, HP is OK with that—so long as it can convince people
that there are worse options out there. The marketing campaign hitting
parts of Europe aims to present HP as real and empathetic. The tagline
“Made to be less hated” seems to acknowledge people’s frustration with
printers. But HP’s a top proponent of the exact sort of money-grabbing,
disruptive practices that have turned people against printers. ↫ Scharon
Harding at Ars Technica I need to print something maybe a few times a
year, and I still hate dealing with my printer more than any other tech
item in my house. Everything about them is bad, and no cutesy marketing
campaign centrered on them being bad is going to change that.</p>

<h2 id="senate-approves-usagm-board">Senate Approves USAGM Board</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate on Wednesday approved six people to serve on the
board of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the government agency that
oversees six congressionally funded international broadcasting and tech
entities, including Voice of America.</p>
<p>The bipartisan International Broadcasting Advisory Board (IBAB) was
approved by the Senate en bloc, meaning the nominees were approved
without a recorded vote.</p>
<p>In an email Thursday to staff, USAGM CEO Amanda Bennett said the
newly approved board “brings a wealth of talent, expertise and passion
to our mission, which remains critical in the wake of the ongoing global
information war.”</p>
<p>“As hundreds of millions of people rely on our fact-based news to
triumph over information manipulation and censorship, the IBAB adds a
layer of oversight and strategic guidance that will undergird our
commitment to freedom and democracy into the future,” she added.</p>
<p>The board members include Jamie Fly, the former head of Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty; Kathleen Cunningham Matthews, a former journalist
and communications executive; Jeffrey Gedmin, a journalist, author and
former head of RFE/RL; Kenneth M. Jarin, a partner at national law firm
Ballard Spahr; Luis Manuel Botello, a former investigative journalist
and consultant for the International Center for Journalists; and
Michelle Mai Selesky Giuda, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state
and acting undersecretary of state.</p>
<p>USAGM has a seven-person board, six of whom are presidentially
appointed and one who is the secretary of state. No more than three can
be affiliated with the same political party.</p>
<p>This is the first USAGM board approved since legislation passed in
late 2020 empowered the board to approve appointments or dismissals of
any network heads.</p>
<p>Under those changes, the board is required to advise the chief
executive on ways to improve the effectiveness of programming, report to
congressional committees and act as a safeguard to ensure the chief
executive “fully respects the professional integrity and editorial
independence” of the networks she oversees.</p>
<p>Those provisions were created after the previous USAGM chief, Michael
Pack, drew widespread criticism for his interpretation of the powers
granted to the presidentially appointed chief executive.</p>
<p>An independent investigation into whistleblower complaints about Pack
and his team’s governance found he abused his authority, allowed gross
mismanagement of funds and breached the editorial firewall designed to
protect USAGM journalists from political interference.</p>
<p>Under the amended provisions approved in late 2020, the USAGM chief
executive now needs majority board approval to hire or remove network
heads.</p>
<p>Bennett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and investigative journalist
and former VOA director, was approved as USAGM chief executive in a
September 2022 vote for a three-year term. She oversees an agency that
for fiscal 2024 submitted a budget request of $944 million and that has
a mission to provide independent international news coverage and
circumvention tools to a weekly audience of 410 million.</p>
<p>USAGM oversees Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the
Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East
Broadcasting Networks. It also oversees the Open Technology Fund, which
provides tools to help audiences overcome internet restrictions and
surveillance.</p>

id="cherokee-nation-chief-speaks-to-voa-on-us-promises-progress">Cherokee
Nation Chief Speaks to VOA on US Promises, Progress</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden convened a two-day summit Wednesday with the
heads of more than 300 tribal groups, saying his administration is
committed to writing “a new and better chapter of history” for the more
than 570 Native American communities in the United States by making it
easier for them to access federal funding.</p>
<p>Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. of the Cherokee Nation, one of the
largest Indigenous tribes in the United States, spoke to VOA about those
efforts and also some of the themes of Native history that are in the
forefront today.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: What are your goals for your half-million citizens at this
summit?</p>
<p>Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr.: It’s to press the administration on
meeting America’s commitment but also learn more about what their plans
are. … The most important thing for the Cherokee Nation, I think — and
all tribes — is the efficient deployment of resources, and then allowing
tribes to decide how to use those resources. So, a more efficient,
streamlined process in terms of getting funding out.</p>
<p>VOA: The Biden administration says it will release at this summit a
report card of sorts. What’s your assessment of how the administration
has succeeded and where it could do better?</p>
<p>Hoskin: I think overall, it’s been very, very positive. … The
bipartisan infrastructure deal has been important for the Cherokee
Nation. The American Rescue Plan has enabled us to do things that may
seem small to the rest of the world, like putting a cell tower in a
community that didn’t have cellphone access, by improving water
systems.</p>
<p>VOA: Any criticism?</p>
<p>Hoskin: To the extent that it’s criticism: The federal government’s a
big ship, it’s tough to steer. What I have seen over the years is, you
get a new administration in, it takes a while for the relationships to
be built up, for executive orders on consultation to translate down to
agencies.</p>
<p>VOA: President Biden has not made — publicly, at least — any sort of
land acknowledgment statement. Is that something you seek?</p>
<p>Hoskin: Reminding the country that there were aboriginal people here
before anyone ever heard of the United States, I think that’s important.
But I think in terms of what tribal citizens want to see, and what
tribal leaders want to see is access to land, control of resources, more
land placed into trust for the benefit of Native Americans.</p>
<p>VOA: The current war between Israel and Hamas is also about land. Do
you have any advice for President Biden, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas during this
very tense moment?</p>
<p>Hoskin: I do think there are some parallels. You’re talking about
people who say that they’ve been on the land from time immemorial.
That’s what we Cherokees say, and we have a history of being
dispossessed from our land. I would just remind people that there’s a
way to balance rights. I think we’re trying to do that in the United
States in terms of Indian Country versus the rest of the country. We
haven’t perfected it, but I think we’re making some progress. So, all I
would say is the respect and dignity that every human being deserves
ought to be on display anytime you’re having these sorts of situations.
That’s a difficult sentiment to express in the midst of some real
difficulties.</p>
<p>VOA: Adversaries of the U.S. have weaponized the well-documented
suffering of Native Americans, saying the U.S. doesn’t have the moral
high ground on the world stage.</p>
<p>Hoskin: Certainly it would be accurate to say the United States has
an appalling record towards Indigenous peoples. Is it perfect now? No,
it’s not. But we’re making progress. I mean, think about what’s happened
on the world stage. In Australia, that country just rejected the
recognition of aboriginal people. In the United States, we have federal
recognition. … We do have a foundation upon which we built a great deal.
And so, to those critics of the United States, I would say, come to the
Cherokee Nation and look at what we’re doing, leading in things like
health care and lifting up people economically. It’s not perhaps the
picture that has been painted by some of these regimes.</p>
<p>VOA: I believe you knew [former Cherokee chief] Wilma Mankiller very
well. Talk a bit about her.</p>
<p>Hoskin: Anybody in the world who cares about human rights, the
dignity of everybody, civil rights, they should get to know her. … She
reminded us of who we are and what we always had in us, which was the
ability to govern ourselves, to protect ourselves, to understand we have
this common history and destiny. She reminded us that we were Cherokee
after generations of being suppressed and a bit beaten down. So, she
lifted us up. The fact that there’s a Barbie doll that depicts her, that
there’s a quarter from the United States Mint — that shows what a
powerful person she was.</p>
<p>VOA: How do you feel about not being consulted on the Barbie
doll?</p>
<p>Hoskin: Well, I think it’s disrespect on the part of Mattel, but I
will also tell you that they very quickly understood that, and we’re
engaging. So, I think that overall, I appreciate Mattel depicting Wilma
Mankiller, the great Cherokee chief. On balance, this is a good
thing.</p>
<p>VOA: What does it mean to you to be an American?</p>
<p>Hoskin: I think a lot about this. I can go back a few generations to
my ancestors who signed up to fight for this country in World War I and
World War II — while within their living memory, there was a great deal
of oppression and atrocities by this country to their own people. But in
terms of the principles of what we want for this country, like freedom
and opportunity for everyone, if we aspire to that, that’s something we
all share. And so for me, that’s what it means to be an American.</p>
<p>VOA: How do you feel about public holidays like Columbus Day and
Thanksgiving?</p>
<p>Hoskin: Columbus Day is abhorrent. [Christopher Columbus is]
demonstrably somebody who engaged in great atrocities towards Native
peoples. … There’s plenty to celebrate in American history without
celebrating and misstating what he did. In terms of Thanksgiving, I
think it’s become for the Cherokee people something that we just
celebrate in terms of what unites humanity, which is giving thanks for
what we have and trying to do better.</p>
<p>VOA: Anything else you’d like to tell our audience? We broadcast in
48 languages. Would you like to say something in your language?</p>
<p>Hoskin: Sure. I’d say “osiyo,” which is “hello” in Cherokee. And
“donadagohvi,” which is ”we will see each other again.” We don’t say
goodbye. We just look forward to seeing people again. I look forward to
seeing you again.</p>
<p>VOA: And I look forward to seeing you again.</p>

<h2 id="us-official-urges-approval-of-new-deals-with-pacific-islands">US
Official Urges Approval of New Deals With Pacific Islands</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A senior U.S. administration official said the United States needs to
move ahead and fulfill its commitment under new arrangements with three
Pacific Island nations as Washington faces fierce competition from
Beijing in the region.</p>
<p>The new 20-year funding programs for the Federated States of
Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Republic of
Palau are awaiting congressional approval. Under the new arrangements,
the U.S. would provide defense and economic assistance while securing
exclusive military access to pivotal areas across the Pacific.</p>
<p>Thursday, the nominee for deputy secretary of state, Kurt Campbell,
told a Senate panel that if Congress fails to fund the agreements, “you
can expect that literally the next day, Chinese diplomats, military and
other folks will be on the plane landing in” each of these island
states, trying to “secure a better deal for China.”</p>
<p>Campbell, currently the White House National Security Council’s
coordinator for Indo-Pacific affairs, also said it is critical for the
United States to support its diplomatic personnel amid intense
competition from China.</p>
<p>“I remember last year we went to the Solomons for the first time. We
landed in our plane. We got off. We were met at the airport by one
[U.S.] diplomat, probably the most hard-charging guy I’ve ever met, and
he was exhausted.</p>
<p>“He was a one-person diplomacy in the Solomons, one of our most
contested places, and was living in a hotel with his dog. And as we
drove into town, we went by the gleaming Chinese Embassy [with] dozens
and dozens of staffers,” Campbell said during his nomination
hearing.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials have said competition should not define
its relationship with the U.S.</p>
<p>“Major-country competition cannot solve the problems facing China and
the United States or the world,” the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said in a readout after U.S. President Joe Biden’s four hours of talks
with Chinese President Xi Jinping on November 15 on the sidelines of the
APEC summit in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Some U.S. lawmakers say they disagree with Beijing’s assessment.</p>
<p>“China intends to replace us, probably by midcentury, as the
economic, military and geopolitical leader of the world,” Republican
Senator Mitt Romney said during Campbell’s nomination hearing Thursday.
“They [China] say, of course, that they’re worried about us, you know,
constraining and containing them, which is laughable. They’re all over
the world, far more than we are.”</p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>Campbell told U.S. lawmakers that the Biden administration’s budget
request to Congress reflects the U.S. strategic commitment to the
Indo-Pacific region, including “to stand with Taiwan” and “to support
the Philippines.”</p>
<p>A turbulent year in U.S.-China relations culminated in talks between
the country’s two leaders in mid-November. Xi told Biden that Taiwan is
the most sensitive issue in their bilateral ties. Ensuring peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait was high on the agenda. According to a
senior U.S. official, Xi signaled that he was unaware of plans for a
massive invasion of Taiwan.</p>
<p>Despite this pledge, China has escalated military activities near the
Taiwan Strait in recent months. The United States has voiced concerns
about any Chinese interference through military coercion, as Taiwan
prepares for a presidential election in January.</p>
<p>Some analysts say there must be credible threats and assurances on
the part of the U.S. to ensure peace and stability in the Taiwan
Strait.</p>
<p>“It is essential that Taiwan and the United States have the ability
to threaten to impose a lot of pain and consequences on the People’s
Republic of China if it were to use force against Taiwan,” Bonnie
Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the German
Marshall Fund, told VOA.</p>
<p>Glaser added that there also need to be “some assurances” from the
U.S., China, and Taiwan at the same time. For example, the United States
has said it does not support Taiwan independence. If China does not use
force, China should be assured that its real interests will not be
damaged. If Taiwan does not declare independence, it will not be
targeted with the use of force by Beijing.</p>
<p>Human rights</p>
<p>During Thursday’s hearing, Senator Ben Cardin, who chairs the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said American foreign policy must be driven
by core values, including promoting democracy, fighting corruption and
defending human rights.</p>
<p>December 10 marks the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.</p>
<p>Some human rights advocates said the way Washington manages the
Israel-Hamas conflict, while safeguarding the rights and dignity of the
Palestinian population, will have a significant impact on the perception
of U.S. credibility and leadership on the global stage.</p>
<p>“The U.S. as a global leader should not selectively apply the
universal human rights values when aligned with its foreign policy
objectives and amplify voices that suit its agenda. Such positioning
undermines the efforts of human rights advocates,” U.S.-based Uyghur
human rights lawyer Rayhan Asat told VOA.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with “a diverse group” of
representatives from human rights organizations on Thursday at the State
Department. A spokesperson said the secretary wants to learn about the
challenges of their work.</p>
<p>If confirmed by the Senate, Campbell will replace Wendy Sherman, who
retired in July, to become deputy secretary of state.</p>

Lawmakers Running Out of Time to Pass Ukraine Aid, Border Security
Funding</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>With just four working days left before its holiday recess, the U.S.
Congress is no closer to passing the White House’s $60 billion request
for aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are running out of time to negotiate a deal on border
security that Republicans say must be included to overcome their
concerns about funding foreign conflicts while leaving domestic
priorities unaddressed.</p>
<p>“This is about securing our border so we can then help our allies,”
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters Thursday.</p>
<p>Watch related video by Patsy Widakuswara:</p>
<p>Graham called on President Joe Biden to enforce existing immigration
laws, saying he would not return to his home state of South Carolina to
“try to explain why I helped Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel and did nothing
to secure our own border. I will help all of our allies, but we have got
to help ourselves first.”</p>
<p>The Ukraine aid request is part of a larger $106 billion emergency
supplemental request that includes military assistance to Israel and
Indo-Pacific partners as well as Democratic priorities for border
security funding.</p>
<p>“Republicans in Congress are willing to give Putin a gift, the
greatest gift that Putin could … hope for,” White House press secretary
Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday.</p>
<p>Senators resumed negotiations Thursday after failing to open debate
on the supplemental request by a 49-51 vote late Wednesday.</p>
<p>“I think the vote yesterday convinced them [Democrats] that we are
serious about it, and something needs to be done,” Senator Jim Risch,
the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told VOA.
“And I’m convinced that we’ll get there. That’s just democracy.”</p>
<p>Democrats object to Republicans’ proposals to change asylum rules at
the U.S. border and argue the White House request must be considered all
together as part of a broader national security strategy.</p>
<p>“It was Republicans who threw an unnecessary wrench into Ukraine
funding by tying it to the extraneous issue of the border,” Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Thursday.</p>
<p>“We all agree that border security is important,” he said. “President
Biden included strong border provisions in the proposal he sent us. But
we also know it’s a complicated issue — very complex — that’s escaped
bipartisan solution for years.”</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been
expected to address a classified briefing for U.S. senators via
videoconference but canceled unexpectedly. The meeting ultimately grew
tense as Republicans accused Democrats and Biden administration briefers
of not addressing their concerns about the border.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a strong supporter of aid to
Ukraine, emphasized Thursday that Republican border security proposals
must be included to win Republican votes.</p>
<p>“It is profoundly unserious to pretend that national security
priorities don’t include securing our nation’s borders,” McConnell said
on the Senate floor Thursday.</p>
<p>“To warn about borders in jeopardy and not start with the one that’s
being overrun here at home,” he said. “To invoke threats facing
sovereign nations without a clear plan to uphold America’s own
sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Brigadier General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said
Tuesday that there is $1.1 billion left to replenish U.S. military
stockpiles for weapons and equipment sent to Ukraine.</p>
<p>The White House also warned earlier this week that the United States
has about $4.8 billion left to supply Ukraine with aid, an amount that
would run out by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Any compromise passed in the Democratic-majority Senate would also
need to pass the Republican-majority House of Representatives, where
support for Ukraine has diminished this year.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has indicated he does not plan to extend
the House schedule past its last scheduled day in session on December
14. Earlier this week, he told reporters several key questions about
accountability and the longer-term strategy for victory in Ukraine
remain.</p>
<p>Many Republicans recognize that aid to Ukraine is important for
deterrence but argue for more oversight.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Michelle Steel told VOA on Thursday, “We’ve
been spending so much — billions and billions of dollars. We have to see
transparency, that exactly where these monies are going and how they’re
spending it.”</p>
<p>According to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, aid
commitments to Ukraine are at their lowest since the beginning of the
war in February 2022.</p>
<p>“Between August and October 2023 saw a stark drop in the amount of
newly committed aid, with the value of new packages totaling just EUR
2.11 billion,” the report said.</p>
<p>Biden has worked to shore up the support of allies amid uncertainty
over passage of the funding on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>“Great Britain and the European countries will keep on supporting
Ukraine,” David Cameron, British foreign secretary and former prime
minister, told VOA.</p>
<p>“But clearly America is an essential partner in this,” he said. “They
are the world’s biggest economy, the biggest defense player, absolutely
vital. So, let’s keep going on making the argument about what a
difference the resources will make.”</p>

<h2 id="us-uk-act-against-russian-hacker-group">US, UK Act Against
Russian Hacker Group</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. government on Thursday unveiled measures to combat Russian
hackers accused of targeting U.S-based entities and individuals and
meddling in a British election.</p>
<p>The cyber actors targeted include the Callisto group, also known as
Star Blizzard or COLDRIVER, which engaged in espionage and is connected
to Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB, according to a statement
released by U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.</p>
<p>Also, the Department of Justice unsealed an indictment against two
Russian hackers, Andrey Stanislavovich Korinets and Ruslan
Aleksandrovich Peretyatko, in connection with what the State Department
called “a criminal hacking conspiracy that targeted U.S.-based entities
and individuals, including U.S. Department of Energy facilities’
employees.”</p>
<p>Financial sanctions</p>
<p>In addition to the indictment, the U.S. Treasury announced it has
imposed financial sanctions on Peretyatko and Korinets for their roles
in malicious cyber-enabled activity.</p>
<p>Under the Rewards For Justice program, or RFJ, the U.S. offered
unspecified rewards for information on the whereabouts of Peretyatko and
Korinets.</p>
<p>A notice on the RFJ website says awards of up to $10 million can go
to anyone who has information “leading to the identification or location
of any person who, while acting at the direction or under the control of
a foreign government, engages in certain malicious cyber activities
against U.S. critical infrastructure.”</p>
<p>Hackers also targeted individuals</p>
<p>The hackers, who the U.S. says worked in the Callisto Group, also
targeted individuals based in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The U.S. noted concern about the hackers’ targeting of the U.K.,
which London described as a failed attempt to interfere with politics
from Russian agents.</p>
<p>The U.K. sanctioned the two hackers in connection with the
cyberattacks and summoned the Russian ambassador.</p>
<p>“I can confirm today that the Russian Federal Security Services, the
FSB, is behind a sustained effort to interfere in our democratic
processes,” British Junior Foreign Minister Leo Docherty said in a
statement to lawmakers.</p>
<p>The hacking group has been known for years to target and attempt to
hack personal emails from high-profile victims.</p>

officially launches its PS5 Access Controller for disabled gamers</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>The controller, which was created in collaboration with disabled
gaming groups such as AbleGamers, Stack-Up, and SpecialEffect, has a
unique circular design. The controller comes with a number of different
button caps, along with three stick caps that can be changed out to suit
the specific needs of the gamer. The controller itself is also designed
to rest on a flat surface for players that would require that kind of
feature. ↫ John Callaham at Neowin Microsoft has a similar product as
well, and it’s great that disabled people who want to play games are
being taken so much more seriously these days. Excellent work from both
console giants.</p>

<h2 id="you-really-ought-to-lease-your-ev">You Really Ought to Lease
Your EV</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcwMzI2Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDI2MzYwMX0.UwD6qZQqjcLw57OD1eP-6K5EQNxS6QhEL_1lKU0zntY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Four years ago I drove my beloved brown dog home from the high desert
beagle rescue in our little red EV. She sat silently in my wife’s lap,
wondering what this new life might entail, and spent the ensuing months
shedding stabby hairs on the seat cover and slobbering on the back
windows as we drove back and forth to the mountains above Los Angeles to
hike our way through the darkest days of COVID. Now, she has lost
exclusive access to the back seat. Two weeks ago, white-knuckled and
nervous, I drove my newborn daughter home from the hospital.
</p>
<p>
These are the moments that transfigure a hunk of metal into the family
car, a thing made of remembrance as much as nuts and bolts. It is a
process possible only when you own a vehicle long enough for the good
stuff of life to seep into the carpets and scratch up the upholstery. In
this way, it matters to me that my Model 3 is <em>our</em> car.
</p>
<p>
However, after four-plus years of electric vehicle ownership, I am here
to tell you: If you’re thinking of getting a new EV this holiday season,
then you should probably lease, not buy.
</p>
<p>
I don’t say this lightly. The idea of leasing sits uneasy with me now
that we live in a subscription society where everything is rented and
nothing is ours. Leasing, though, could be an ideal solution for those
who want to try out the electric life but have reservations about going
all-in. And at this moment in the EV age, it’s hard to argue with
leasing logic.
</p>
<p>
For one thing, in terms of resale value, owning a used EV isn’t what it
used to be. In 2021, during the chaos of peak pandemic, used car prices
<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/buying-a-car/when-to-buy-a-used-car-a6584238157/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spiked</a>
to unprecedented levels. As those prices have begun to come down to
Earth, EVs are reportedly
<a href="https://jalopnik.com/evs-are-losing-half-their-value-in-just-three-years-1851069990" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">depreciating</a>
at levels faster than gasoline cars, losing as much as half their value
in three years, in part because of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">price-cutting
wars</a> that slashed the cost of a new electric over the past year. As
the cost of a new EV continues to fall, the value of owning an older one
will wane.
</p>
<p>
Leasing, at least right now, is also a simpler and better way to shop
for an EV. As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_self">reported</a>
last week, the tax credits for buying electric are becoming an even more
confusing mess in 2024 because Inflation Reduction Act rules mandate
domestic manufacturing for pretty much all components of a qualifying
car. But a buyer can skirt much of the red tape by leasing rather than
buying. Quality but foreign-built EVs like the Hyundai Ioniqs, which
don’t qualify for tax credits if you buy them, can qualify if you lease
them, too.
</p>
<p>
Plus, after three years of driving an EV, you might be eager to start
over. I bought a Tesla in 2019 when the most affordable Standard Range
Plus version of the Model 3 came with an Environmental Protection
Agency-estimated 240 miles of range. If I’d leased it, I could have
returned the car by now and gotten into a new Model 3 or Y with at least
260 miles of range, a nice little quality-of-life bump. (Honestly,
what’s more likely is that after years of living with the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/whats-best-ev-range-300" target="_self">limitations</a>
of a shorter-range EV, I would have ponied up for a longer-range model
on the second go-round.) Instead, I’m stuck with my slowly decaying
battery for as long as I decide to hold onto this car.
</p>
<p>
The other perk of leasing is the freedom from long-term
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-maintenance-tesla-tires" target="_self">maintenance</a>
and other ownership issues. The EV revolution is still young enough that
we don’t know how today’s EVs will age, or what particular problems
Model 3s or Chevy Bolts or Ford F-150 Lightnings might encounter when
they reach 10 or 12 or 15 years old. EV owners will face thorny
questions about whether to replace a battery that’s lost much of its
capacity, live with the depleted range, or get out from under the car.
EV lessees won’t.
</p>
<p>
The most compelling reason not to buy an EV today, though, is that you
don’t know
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-r2-jeep-wrangler-volkswagen-idbuzz-fiat-500e-canoo-tesla-model-2" target="_self">what’s
coming around the corner</a> tomorrow. We’re on the cusp of seeing the
carmakers produce fully electric versions of all sorts of iconic and
beloved vehicles, from the Jeep Wrangler to the Chevy Corvette. Battery
improvements will mean more cars on the market with longer ranges,
making longer-distance travel less burdensome.
</p>
<p>
Think of an EV like a smartphone. Gas-powered cars are like the iPhones
and Androids of today — a mature, honestly kind of boring technology
that doesn’t change much from year to year. Electric cars are more like
what smartphones were 10 years ago, when each passing year brought what
felt like a major leap forward and your two- or three-year-old phone
felt woefully out of date.
</p>
<p>
Years from now, when you know exactly what you’re getting into, you
might feel more comfortable buying an EV to serve as the dutiful family
car for a decade to come — the car that takes your son to second grade
<em>and</em> the car he learns to drive in. But if you don’t want to be
tied down by what’s on offer today, maybe you should just lease it until
tomorrow rolls around.

ID.4 Could Be Volkswagen’s First EV Made With U.S. Union Labor</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDY5NDk5MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwNTc4NjI3MH0.6Jl9qF8mLy6BN4q0Jn-dlVEQHRdp8yflLhrn2tyxvXc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
In Shawn Fain’s victory speech after the United Autoworkers won
significant raises and benefits from the Big Three automakers earlier
this fall, the union president promised to go on to accomplish what no
other UAW president had managed to do. “We’re going to organize
non-union auto companies like we’ve never organized before,” he said.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday, the union made its first move: Workers at Volkswagen’s
plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee
<a href="https://uaw.org/volkswagen-workers-chattanooga-launch-public-campaign-join-uaw-1000-workers-signed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">went
public with a union drive</a>, announcing that more than 30% of the
plant had signed union authorization cards.
</p>
<p>
After the UAW won 25% raises in its deals with GM, Ford, and Stellantis,
Volkswagen gave its workers an 11% raise. In a
<a href="https://uaw.org/volkswagen-workers-chattanooga-launch-public-campaign-join-uaw-1000-workers-signed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press
release</a>, workers at the Chattanooga plant said they were striking
due to pay that lagged behind their unionized peers, mistreatment by
management, forced overtime, and a lack of time off. “Turnover at the
plant is a serious problem,” said Josh Epperson, an equipment operator
in assembly. “I have trained new people on the line and most of them are
gone in a few months. They don’t have the tools and the support they
need to thrive.”
</p>
<p>
The Chattanooga plant opened 15 years ago and is VW’s only factory in
the U.S.; by contrast, all of the company’s workers in Germany are
unionized. The U.S. plant currently produces the VW Atlas, Atlas Sport,
and the company’s only electric model currently available here, the
ID.4.
</p>
<p>
Workers at the U.S. plant have already attempted to unionize twice, in
2014 and 2019, both of which were narrow losses. An
<a href="https://labornotes.org/2019/06/why-uaw-lost-again-chattanooga" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">account
of what went wrong</a> in 2019 by Chris Brooks, a labor activist and
current strategist for Shawn Fain, said that lawmakers threatened to
pull incentives for the plant’s expansion and new electric vehicle line
if the plant flipped.
</p>
<p>
Similar expansions are on the table again this time around. In early
November, senior vice president and head of strategy at VW Group of
America Reinhard Fischer
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-aims-bring-under-35000-ev-us-3-4-years-vw-executive-2023-11-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced
plans to bring a new, under-$35,000 EV to the U.S. market</a>. He said
the company would either build the vehicle at the Chattanooga Plant or
in Puebla, Mexico. He also said that the company was considering
assembling battery packs for the vehicle in the U.S. due to subsidies in
the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
While 30% support is low, it clears the threshold to submit a petition
to the National Labor Relations Board to hold a vote on the union’s
formation. Still, the Chattanooga workers are likely to hold off for
more. The
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-launches-bid-organize-tesla-entire-non-union-auto-sector-2023-11-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">UAW
has said</a> that once 50% of workers at a nonunion plant sign cards,
Fain will hold a rally at the plant. If the drive gets 70% support, UAW
will seek recognition from the company, or otherwise submit a petition
to the NLRB.
</p>
<p>
There are 13 non-union automakers operating in the U.S. Tesla, which has
<a href="https://www.tesla.com/manufacturing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">six
factories here</a>, could be next — Fain
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uaw-says-64-workers-vote-ratify-detroit-three-contracts-2023-11-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
<em>Reuters</em></a> that many workers at the EV giant have also
expressed interest in organizing.

the name the Pro is really the middle chip, but there’s no middle laptop
for it. The base M2 and M3 can be configured with more RAM (to a point)

<p>
The “green” puns pretty much write themselves. On Wednesday, Ireland set
an all-time high for wind output on the Irish grid at 4,629 megawatts,
<a href="https://www.greencollective.io/post/2023-12-07-new-wind-record" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Green
Collective reports</a>.
</p>
<p>
By midnight Thursday, wind had accounted for a smidgen over 70% of
Ireland’s total electricity demands for the day.

In 2022, Ireland
<a href="https://ember-climate.org/insights/research/global-electricity-review-2023/#supporting-material" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ranked
third in the world</a>, alongside Uruguay, when it came to its share of
electricity generated by wind power: 33%. Only perennial wind leader
Denmark, which generated a whopping 55% of its electricity from gusty
weather last year, and surging Lithuania (38%),
<a href="https://www.windpowermonthly.com/article/1819268/powerhouse-wind-worlds-fastest-growing-energy-source-2022-%E2%80%93-ember#:~:text=Denmark%20had%20the%20highest%20percentage,electricity%20mix%20in%20developing%20economies." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">edged
it out</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s not just — forgive me — luck, either. According to the <em>COP28
Global Offshore Wind Update</em>, a new report from industry consultancy
ERM published yesterday, only two countries out of the 19 that have 2030
offshore wind targets are expected to hit them: Ireland being one, and
Poland being the other,
<a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/wind/just-two-nations-to-hit-targets-as-offshore-wind-falls-far-short-of-global-climate-needs/2-1-1566203" target="_blank"><em>Recharge</em>
writes</a>. Most of its current wind capacity, however, is from onshore
wind farms.
</p>
<p>
Ireland’s wind generation information is easily accessible from EirGrid,
making the region a favorite case study among energy nerds — including
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/fun-stuff/this-twitter-bot-showcases-irelands-role-as-a-leader-in-renewable-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
creators</a> of the charming
<a href="https://twitter.com/IrishEnergyBot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Irish
Energy Bot</a> (which later evolved into Green Collective). Earlier this
year, the account
<a href="https://twitter.com/IrishEnergyBot/status/1706601615736586374" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">also
celebrated</a> wind generation exceeding “all-island electricity demand”
in Ireland for the first time, during overnight hours and Storm
Agnes-related gusts. According to
<a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/09/28/ireland-wind-generation-exceeds-demand-for-electricity-for-the-first-time-ever" target="_blank"><em>EuroNews</em></a>,
such trends have translated into significant savings:
</p>
<blockquote>
[As of September, the] latest figures mean that in total, Irish wind
farms provided 32% of the country’s power over the first eight months of
2023. Electricity prices on days with the most wind power dropped by an
average of 5% to €88.34 [$95] per megawatt-hour.<br/> <br/> On days when
Ireland relied almost entirely on fossil fuels, that cost rose to
€123.07 [$132] per megawatt-hour.
</blockquote>
<p>
With numbers like that, who needs a crummy old pot of gold?

House Votes to Censure Democratic Member for Pulling Fire Alarm in
Capitol Office Building</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>House members voted again Thursday to punish one of their own,
targeting Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman for triggering a fire alarm in a
U.S. Capitol office building when the chamber was in session.</p>
<p>The Republican censure resolution passed with a few Democratic votes,
but most of the party stood by Bowman in opposition of an effort they
said lacked credibility and integrity. The prominent progressive now
becomes the third Democratic House member to be admonished this year
through the censure process, which is a punishment one step below
expulsion from the House.</p>
<p>“It’s painfully obvious to myself, my colleagues and the American
people that the Republican Party is deeply unserious and unable to
legislate,” Bowman said Wednesday as he defended himself during floor
debate. “Their censure resolution against me today continues to
demonstrate their inability to govern and serve the American
people.”</p>
<p>The 214-191 vote to censure Bowman caps nearly a year of chaos and
retribution in the House of Representatives. Since January, the chamber
has seen the removal of a member from a committee assignment, the first
ouster of a speaker in history and, just last week, the expulsion of a
lawmaker for only the third time since the Civil War.</p>
<p>Rep. Lisa McClain, a Republican from Michigan, who introduced the
censure resolution, defended it, claiming Bowman pulled the alarm in
September to “cause chaos and the stop the House from doing its
business” as lawmakers scrambled to pass a bill to fund the government
before a shutdown deadline.</p>
<p>“It is reprehensible that a Member of Congress would go to such
lengths to prevent House Republicans from bringing forth a vote to keep
the government operating and Americans receiving their paychecks,”
McClain said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bowman pleaded guilty in October to a misdemeanor count for the
incident, which took place in the Cannon House Office Building. He
agreed to pay a $1,000 fine and serve three months of probation, after
which the false fire alarm charge is expected to be dismissed from his
record under an agreement with prosecutors.</p>
<p>The fire alarm prompted a buildingwide evacuation when the House was
in session and staffers were working in the building. The building was
reopened an hour later after Capitol police determined there was no
threat.</p>
<p>Bowman apologized and said that at the time he was trying to get
through a door that was usually open but was closed that day because it
was the weekend.</p>
<p>Many progressive Democrats, who spoke in his defense, called the
Republican effort to censure him “unserious,” and the accused those
across the aisle of weaponizing the censure process against Democrats
over and over again for political gain.</p>
<p>“Censure me next. That’s how worthless your effort is,” Democratic
Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on the floor late Wednesday. “It has no
credibility. No integrity. No legitimacy. Censure me next, and I’ll take
that censure and I’ll wear it next week, next month, next year like a
badge of honor.”</p>
<p>The vote is the latest example of how the chamber has begun to deploy
punishments like censure, long viewed as a punishment of last resort,
routinely and often in strikingly partisan ways.</p>
<p>“Under Republican control, this chamber has become a place where
trivial issues get debated passionately and important ones not at all,”
Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said during floor
debate. “Republicans have focused more on censuring people in this
Congress than passing bills that help people we represent or improving
this country in any way.”</p>
<p>While the censure of a lawmaker carries no practical effect, it
amounts to severe reproach from colleagues, as lawmakers who are
censured are usually asked to stand in the well of the House as the
censure resolution against them is read aloud.</p>
<p>Bowman is now the 27th person to be censured by the chamber — and the
third just this year. Last month, Republicans voted to censure
Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan in an extraordinary rebuke of
her rhetoric about the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>In June, Democrat Adam Schiff of California was censured for comments
he made several years ago about investigations into then-President
Donald Trump’s ties to Russia.</p>

<p>
The European Union launched the first stage of its carbon border tax
this fall, and the world’s biggest emerging economies aren’t happy.
</p>
<p>
As of October 1, the
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/17/1171238285/how-a-european-law-might-get-companies-around-the-world-to-cut-climate-pollution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EU
regulation</a> officially known as the “carbon border adjustment
mechanism” requires importers to report the emissions associated with
making steel, cement, fertilizers, and other carbon-intensive products.
Those embedded emissions will then be subject to a targeted carbon tax
starting in 2026.
</p>
<p>
The tariff isn’t merely punitive — rather, it’s intended to keep
companies in the EU competitive with those in countries with lower or
nonexistent carbon regulations. (The EU has capped internal carbon
emissions since 2005.) But Brazil, China, India, and South Africa have
all pushed back against the EU for
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/10/what-is-a-carbon-border-tax-what-does-it-mean-for-trade/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raising
trade barriers</a>, calling the adjustment “discriminatory.”
</p>
<p>
Now, Brazil has brought those grievances to COP28. On behalf of the four
countries, it pushed for language — seemingly authored by China — to be
inserted into an
<a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/GST_0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">early
draft</a> of the agenda-setting global stocktake that will be negotiated
during the conference, <em>Politico</em>
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brazil-anger-eu-carbon-tax-infiltrates-cop28-luiz-ignazio-lula-da-silva-china-india-south-africa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
</p>
<p>
The draft text “expresses serious concern” about policies like the EU’s
tariff, “which are not aligned with the principles of the Paris
Agreement, in particular equity and common but differentiated
responsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as [World Trade
Organization] rules.” Brazil’s
<a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/COP28_BASIC-Agenda%20proposal.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">submission</a>
argues that such “unilateral” measures “seriously undermine multilateral
cooperation and the ability of the concerned countries to combat climate
change.”
</p>
<p>
In fact, top WTO officials have
<a href="https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news21_e/ddgjp_16sep21_e.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">voiced
support</a> in the past for rules that address “carbon leakage” and have
said they’re trying to overcome international differences on carbon
pricing,
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/wto-ngozi-okonjo-iweala-carbon-pricing-climate-change-trade/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> an earlier <em>Politico </em>report.
</p>
<p>
Rebeca Grynspan, secretary general of the United Nations conference on
trade and development, spoke up for emerging economies at COP28,
<a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231204-unintended-consequences-friction-at-cop28-over-green-trade" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explaining</a>
at an event that they see green trade barriers like the EU’s as
“protectionist” and as “an obstacle for their development,” according to
<em>Agence France-Presse</em>. Ajay Banga, president of the World Bank,
also warned in Dubai of “unintended consequences” from regulating trade.
</p>
<p>
European negotiators, for their part, don’t seem too worried. “We don’t
expect them to derail the conversations, mostly because I don’t think
any party expects this to be a forum for a discussion” on trade, EU
representative Jacob Werksman told reporters. “There’s a whole other
institution for that. That’s the World Trade Organization.”

Sanctions Money Lending Network to Houthi Rebels in Yemen</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Responding to increased attacks on ships in the southern Red Sea by
Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, the U.S. announced sanctions against 13
people and firms alleged to be providing tens of millions of dollars
from the sale and shipment of Iranian commodities to the Houthis in
Yemen. </p>
<p>Treasury says that previously sanctioned Houthi and Iranian financial
facilitator Sa’id al-Jamal uses a network of exchange houses and firms
to help Iranian money reach the country’s militant partners in
Yemen. </p>
<p>The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and
prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with
Americans. </p>
<p>Money lenders in Lebanon, Turkey and Dubai are listed for assisting
al-Jamal, along with shipping firms from Russia to St. Kitts and Nevis,
which allegedly move al-Jamal’s Iranian commodity shipments. All people
and firms were hit with sanctions Thursday. </p>
<p>Brian Nelson, Treasury’s under secretary for terrorism and financial
intelligence, said the Houthis “continue to receive funding and support
from Iran, and the result is unsurprising: unprovoked attacks on
civilian infrastructure and commercial shipping, disrupting maritime
security and threatening international commercial trade.” </p>
<p>“Treasury will continue to disrupt the financial facilitation and
procurement networks that enable these destabilizing activities.” </p>
<p>Since October, the Houthis have launched missile and drone attacks
over commercial shipping operations in the Red Sea and the Gulf of
Aden. </p>
<p>The Houthis have sporadically targeted ships in the region over time,
but the attacks have increased since the start of the war between Israel
and Hamas, spiking after an October 17 explosion at a hospital in Gaza
killed and injured many. Houthi leaders have insisted Israel is their
target.</p>

Judge Grants Pregnant Woman Permission To Get An Abortion Despite
State’s Ban</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A Texas judge on Thursday granted a pregnant woman permission to
obtain an abortion in an unprecedented challenge to the state’s ban that
took effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned last year.</p>
<p>It was unclear how quickly or whether Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother
of two from the Dallas area, will be able to obtain an abortion. State
District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, an elected Democrat, said she would
grant a temporary restraining order that would allow Cox to have an
abortion under what are narrow exceptions to the state’s ban. That
decision is likely to be appealed by the state.</p>
<p>Cox is 20 weeks pregnant and doctors say her fetus has a fatal
diagnosis. In a brief emergency hearing Thursday, her attorneys told
Gamble that Cox went to an emergency room this week for a fourth time
since her pregnancy.</p>
<p>Cox and her husband both attended the hearing via Zoom but did not
address the court. Doctors have told Cox that if the baby’s heartbeat
were to stop, inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture
because of her prior cesarean sections, and that another C-section at
full term would endanger her ability to carry another child.</p>
<p>“This law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking
and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Gamble said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is believed to be the first of its kind in the nation
since the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, according
to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox.</p>
<p>Since that landmark ruling, Texas and 12 other states rushed to ban
abortion at nearly all stages of pregnancy. Opponents have sought to
weaken those bans — including an ongoing Texas challenge over whether
the state’s law is too restrictive for women with pregnancy
complications — but until now, a woman has not gone to court seeking
approval for an immediate abortion.</p>
<p>“I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued
this pregnancy or continue to put my body or my mental health through
the risks of continuing this pregnancy,” Cox wrote in an editorial
published in The Dallas Morning News. “I do not want my baby to arrive
in this world only to watch her suffer.”</p>
<p>Although Texas allows exceptions under the ban, doctors and women
have argued that the requirements are so vaguely worded that physicians
still won’t risk providing abortions, lest they face potential criminal
charges or lawsuits.</p>
<p>State officials had asked Gamble to deny the request, alleging that
Cox does not meet the requirements for an exception to the ban.</p>
<p>“There are no facts pled which demonstrate that Ms. Cox is at any
more of a risk, let alone life-threatening, than the countless women who
give birth every day with similar medical histories,” the state
wrote.</p>
<p>Cox has been told by doctors that her baby will likely be stillborn
or live for a week at most, according to the lawsuit filed in Austin.
The suit says doctors told her their “hands are tied” under Texas’
abortion ban.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed a week after the Texas Supreme Court heard
arguments about whether the ban is too restrictive for women with
pregnancy complications. That case is among the biggest ongoing
challenges to abortion bans in the U.S., although a ruling from the
all-Republican court may not come for months.</p>
<p>Cox had cesarean sections with her previous pregnancies. She learned
she was pregnant for a third time in August and was told weeks later
that her baby was at a high risk for a condition known as trisomy 18,
which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth and low
survival rates, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>In July, several Texas women gave emotional testimony about carrying
babies they knew would not survive and doctors unable to offer abortions
despite their spiraling conditions. A judge later ruled that Texas’ ban
was too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications, but that
decision was swiftly put on hold after the state appealed.</p>
<p>More than 40 woman have received abortions in Texas since the ban
took effect, according to state health figures, none of which have
resulted in criminal charges. There were more than 16,000 abortions in
Texas in the five months prior to the ban taking effect last year.</p>

<h2 id="cop28-so-far-a-cheat-sheet">COP28 So Far: A Cheat Sheet</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDY5Nzk2MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwOTcyMzgzN30.2yC9IG_w_mrkVCEOeY8WmswS8l0epAOaPFRPUid39nY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s a “rest day” at COP28, which means there probably won’t be a ton of
news coming out of Dubai as delegates take a breather before the
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-negotiations-cop28-warming-fossil-fuels-c4fe8a0b106888f2d9c505823749d179" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate
talks shift into high gear</a> tomorrow. That makes now a good time to
reflect on what’s happened so far and what to expect as the conference
enters its second half.
</p>
<p>
Some key accomplishments:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The loss and damage fund: </strong>On day one of the conference,
world leaders reached a landmark
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-loss-damage-reparations-fund" target="_self">deal</a>
to help vulnerable nations deal with the costly effects of climate
change. The early accomplishment set an optimistic tone for the summit —
although <em>The Guardian</em>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/06/700m-pledged-to-loss-and-damage-fund-cop28-covers-less-than-02-percent-needed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notes</a>
that wealthy countries have so far pledged $700 million to the fund,
“far short of what is needed.” In total, countries have announced
<a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/news/2023/12/CP28-mobilizes-over-57-billion-in-first-four-days" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$57
billion</a> of various funding pledges at the conference.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Methane cuts:</strong> About 50 oil and gas companies pledged to
slash their methane leaks by 2030.
<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2406730-cop28-the-biggest-climate-wins-and-flops-from-the-first-week/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Critics</a>
cry greenwashing, but as Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-methane-limits-warming" target="_self">points
out</a>, recent technological advances in methane monitoring – including
satellites, drones, and handheld detectors – could help in the
international effort to hold these companies accountable. A planned $40
million infusion from billionaire philanthropist Michael Bloomberg will
bolster the cause, too.
</li>
<li>
<strong>A renewables pledge:</strong> At least 120 countries
<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/cop28-leaders-voluntary-pledge-to-triple-renewable-power-like-mission-impossible-admits-irena-chief-13021849" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backed</a>
a pledge to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030. That goal
made it into an early draft of the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-draft" target="_self">global
stocktake report</a>, the summit’s final deliverable, but that’s no
guarantee it will be formally adopted.
</li>
<li>
<strong>A nuclear energy declaration:</strong> More than 20 countries
including the U.S., Canada, the UK, and the United Arab Emirates,
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/cop28-countries-launch-declaration-triple-nuclear-energy-capacity-2050-recognizing-key" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pledged</a>
to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Growing support for a fossil phase-out: </strong>The number of
countries pledging to voluntarily end oil and gas extraction and
exploration
<a href="https://www.businessgreen.com/news/4153387/cop28-quiet-progress-summit-sidelines-countries-pledge-phase-coal-gas-oil" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">grew</a>
to 24 when Spain, Kenya, and Samoa joined the Beyond Oil &amp; Gas
Alliance
</li>
<li>
<strong>A global cooling pledge:</strong> More than 60 countries
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-joins-dozens-countries-backing-cop28-pledge-slash-cooling-emissions-2023-12-05/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pledged</a>
to reduce their cooling-related emissions by at least 68% by 2050.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Still to come:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Phase out or phase down?: </strong>The global stocktake will be
the main focus heading into the second week of COP28. This key document
will set out the world’s climate goals for the coming years, and help
determine how they’ll be accomplished. The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-fossil-fuels-phaseout" target="_self">most
contentious issue</a> is whether to include a call for a phase out of
fossil fuels. A new draft of the global stocktake is expected tomorrow.
</li>
<li>
<strong>What comes after $100 billion?:</strong> Ministers will also
need to
<a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-12-climate-business-cop28-summit.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lay
the groundwork</a> for new climate financing targets for poorer
countries. Rich nations recently (and belatedly) hit their goal of
providing $100 billion annually for poorer countries, a pledge set out
in 2009. But finance efforts don’t end there,
<a href="https://www.wri.org/research/untangling-finance-goal-introduction-new-collective-quantified-goal#:~:text=At%20COP29%20in%202024%20a,and%20priorities%20of%20developing%20countries.%22" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a>
the World Resources Institute. Next year’s COP will call for setting a
new “collective quantified goal” that uses the existing $100 billion
target as a jumping off point but will likely balloon to be much bigger.
Delegates in Dubai will try to come to some consensus on what to
prioritize when negotiations start at COP29.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
“We had a pretty damn good week here in Dubai already,” U.S. Special
Envoy John Kerry
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-negotiations-cop28-warming-fossil-fuels-c4fe8a0b106888f2d9c505823749d179" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a>
the AP. But underlying it all is the reality that the event is being
held in one of the world’s biggest petrostates, fossil fuel lobbyists
are
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/12/05/un-climate-conference-dubai-oil-lobbyists/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">out
in force</a>, and the summit’s president, Sultan Al-Jaber, has been
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/04/climate/cop28-aljaber-fossil-fuels.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">openly
skeptical</a> about the science connecting fossil fuel caps to taming
global temperatures.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not telling you that everybody’s going to come kumbaya to the
table,” Kerry
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/kerry-backs-some-fossil-fuel-phaseout-to-reach-net-zero-goal?srnd=green&sref=a2d7LMhq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">added</a>,
“but I am telling you we’re going to make our best effort to get the
best agreement we can to move as far as we can as fast as we can. That’s
what people in the world want us to do. It’s time for adults to behave
like adults and get the job done.”
</p>
<p>
The summit is set to end on December 12, but previous COPs have run into
overtime.

<h2 id="trump-back-at-new-york-fraud-trial-as-testimony-nears-end">Trump
Back at New York Fraud Trial as Testimony Nears End</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump returned to his civil business fraud
trial as a spectator Thursday, after a month of assailing the
proceedings from afar. </p>
<p>With testimony winding down after more than two months, the
Republican 2024 presidential front-runner showed up to watch an
accounting professor testify about financial topics important to the
case. </p>
<p>Trump himself is scheduled to take the stand Monday, for a second
time. </p>
<p>Even while campaigning to reclaim the presidency and fighting four
criminal cases, Trump is devoting a lot of attention to the New York
lawsuit. He’s been a frustrated onlooker, a confrontational witness and
a heated commentator outside the courtroom door. </p>
<p>“This is a witch hunt, and it’s a very corrupt trial,” Trump said on
his way into court Thursday. </p>
<p>The case is putting his net worth on trial, scrutinizing the real
estate empire that first built his reputation, and threatening to block
him from doing business in his native state. </p>
<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James’ suit accuses Trump, his
company and some executives of misleading banks and insurers by giving
them financial statements full of inflated values for such signature
assets as his Trump Tower penthouse and Mar-a-Lago, the Florida club
where he now lives. The statements were provided to help secure deals —
including loans at attractive interest rates available to hyperwealthy
people — and some loans required updated statements each year. </p>
<p>Trump denies any wrongdoing, and he posits that the statements’
numbers actually fell short of his wealth. He also has downplayed the
documents’ importance in getting deals, saying it was clear that lenders
and others should do their own analyses. And he claims the case is a
partisan abuse of power by James and Judge Arthur Engoron, both
Democrats. </p>
<p>The former president has regularly railed about the case on his Truth
Social platform. </p>
<p>Going to court in person affords him a microphone — in fact, many of
them, on the news cameras positioned in the hallway. He often stops on
his way into and out of the proceedings, which cameras can’t record, to
expostulate and to cast various developments as victories. </p>
<p>His out-of-court remarks got him fined $10,000 Oct. 26, when Engoron
decided Trump had violated a gag order that prohibits participants in
the trial from commenting publicly on court staffers. Trump’s lawyers
are appealing the gag order. </p>
<p>James hasn’t let Trump go unanswered, often — but not Thursday —
showing up to court herself when he’s there and making her own comments
on social media and the courthouse steps. Lawyers in the case have been
told not to make press statements in the hallway, but the former
president has been allowed to do so. </p>
<p>“Here’s a fact: Donald Trump has engaged in years of financial fraud.
Here’s another fact: When you break the law, there are consequences,”
her office wrote this week on X, formerly Twitter. </p>
<p>While the non-jury trial is airing claims of conspiracy, insurance
fraud and falsifying business records, Engoron ruled beforehand that
Trump and other defendants engaged in fraud. He ordered that a receiver
take control of some of Trump’s properties, but an appeals court has
held off on that order for now. </p>
<p>At trial, James is seeking more than $300 million in penalties and a
prohibition on Trump and other defendants doing business in New
York. </p>
<p>It’s not clear exactly when testimony will wrap up, but it’s expected
before Christmas. Closing arguments are scheduled in January, and
Engoron is aiming for a decision by the end of that month.</p>

Gates on COP28, the Green Premium, and Trump’s Threat to Climate
Tech</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDY0Njc4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODI2NTE3MX0.7Licir7cuYPIwB1TPvRJb_b9kktlwFC30cguVWiawbk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Eight years ago, at the Paris climate convention, Bill Gates committed
$2 billion to fighting climate change.
</p>
<p>
You have to admire his ROI. Since then, Breakthrough Energy, the set of
Gates-linked climate groups, has become ubiquitous on the topic. It
invested in dozens of climate-tech startups, and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-16/how-bill-gates-lobbied-to-save-the-climate-tax-bill-biden-just-signed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gates
personally lobbied</a> for the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.
</p>
<p>
Gates has also come to formulate a big idea:
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/02/bill-gatess-new-way-to-understand-climate-action/618043/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
“green premium,”</a> the gap between the cost of a fossil-fueled
technology and the cost of a climate-friendly one. Right now,
electricity generation has almost no green premium, for instance — solar
power
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/battery-storage-solar-transmission-handmer" target="_self">is
dirt cheap</a> — but steelmaking’s green premium is
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/46d4727c-761d-43ee-8084-ee46edba491a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very
high</a>. Only when the world gets green premiums down to zero for every
economic activity, Gates argues, will it be able to seriously solve
climate change.
</p>
<p>
I had a few minutes to chat with Gates on the sidelines of COP28, the
United Nations climate conference in Dubai, about green premiums and
what we were doing in Dubai in the first place. Our conversation has
been edited for length and clarity.
</p>
<h3>
On the point of COP, the massive United Nations climate conference:
</h3>
<p>
Well, there’s a lot of good things that happen at COP. Remember that
there are many sectors that make up the solution. Small, innovative
companies — and Breakthrough Energy has 30 [startups] here, I bet you
there’s 70 others — they need big companies, they need government
policies, and they have booths here. And they give people a sense:
<em>Oh, there is a new way to make steel. Well, how quickly can that be
adopted? How quickly do you get the green premium down to zero? Are my
steel companies and my company engaged in this? What do they think?
</em>It keeps the pressure on.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, there is no coercive mechanism here. So solving global
problems — given that you don’t have world government — maybe you need
meetings of 70,000 people to try and say, “Hey, come on, everybody,
let’s do this together.” You know, anti-climate people say, “Hey, why
should the U.S. make sacrifices? Because if the U.S. alone does this, or
even U.S. and Europe, the [effect on global average temperature] is
very, very small and it’s not worth doing.”
</p>
<p>
Climate is so complicated. To really understand climate, you’d have to
be a physicist, a biologist, an atmospheric scientist. People who are
polymathic love the subject, because it allows you to say, “Oh, I’m
reading a book that’s going to help you understand climate” — and almost
any science book you can justify.
</p>
<p>
So getting people to understand a little bit more about climate … this
is an atmosphere that the bias is toward exaggerating the impact of
climate, but oh well. Maybe the signal gets muted when it gets out to
the other 7 billion, and so we have to kind of, you know, overdo it here
so at least it gets <em>some</em> resonance.
</p>
<h3>
On carbon taxes and who should pay for climate mitigation:
</h3>
<p>
The political situation is that about 40% of voters are like, “Wow, I
didn’t know my lifestyle was going to be reduced because of this. Isn’t
there some rich guy or some other country or someone else who should be
paying for this electric heat pump, or paying more money for their
gasoline because of your carbon tax?”
</p>
<p>
Washington State has a
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/was-carbon-pricing-program-nears-1-billion-in-revenue-far-outpacing-early-estimates/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">carbon
tax</a>, which is kind of unusual in that it’s been focused on gasoline,
so it’s actually raised the gasoline price. We have a
<a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/opponents-of-wa-climate-law-file-signatures-to-repeal-it/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">referendum</a>
[to overturn the law in the works] — it’ll be interesting to watch.
</p>
<h3>
On the perils of climate change as an elite-driven political issue:
</h3>
<p>
Even in Europe, who you’d have to say is the most climate-committed
region of the world, they have very few political parties — although
maybe the one just won the Netherlands elections is one of them — who
are like, “Hey, screw all this, let’s do nothing.” But even there they
have to be careful because the elites‘ commitment to climate greatly
exceeds the general voter’s. So when Macron puts on his diesel tax, that
lasted about three months, because the rural people who are less
well-off than the urban people said, “Oh, this tax is targeted at us.
You’ve lost touch.” And then a whole movement gets created around that,
and he pulled the diesel tax really quickly. And compared to the carbon
tax that you <em>should </em>have on diesel, [Macron’s diesel tax] was
like a tenth of the increase.
</p>
<p>
So, you know, the 70,000 here aren’t — it’s like the Republican primary,
it’s not a representative set of people. For me, you know, I only have
one hammer, which is innovation, whether it’s software, global health,
or climate. I’ve never seen a problem that innovation can’t solve, which
is a caricature, but that’s where I add value. It’s organizing the
capital and the teams and the goals. It’s fantastic how much progress
we’ve made in eight years.
</p>
<h3>
On how the IRA implementation is going:
</h3>
<p>
It’s going super well. They’ve got [former White House chief of staff]
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/john-podesta-tax-credits-schedule-hydrogen-sustainable-aviation-fuel-manufacturing" target="_blank">John
Podesta</a> [leading the effort], who’s here helping to try and make
sure it goes faster than normal. We fund groups that are helping with
IRA implementation. There’s various philanthropic things we’ve done in
support of getting the IRA to move quickly — so that, like Obamacare,
maybe it’s more popular four years after it passes in red states than it
was the day that it went through on a purely partisan vote.
</p>
<h3>
On whether he believes in Goldman Sachs’ estimate that the government
will
<a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/the-us-is-poised-for-an-energy-revolution.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provide
a staggering $1.2 trillion of incentives</a> under the Inflation
Reduction Act:
</h3>
<p>
Some people have estimated the cost of these tax credits at way beyond
what they were scored. I think they’re wrong, because their EV number
was insane — that Goldman Sachs, $1.2 trillion thing. But the Congress
is there if a tax credit over-succeeds. They can — at year four, five,
six — cut it back or eliminate it.
</p>
<h3>
On why electing Donald Trump to the White House (again) could set back
climate action for decades:
</h3>
<p>
Right now, companies are responding to the IRA incentives. But you know,
if you get Trump elected, and he really gets rid of it, there’s a lot of
business plans that will [make people] feel foolish. And then for the
future, it’s going to be very tough. Because even if the Democrats come
in and put something new in, people say, “Well, you’re asking me to make
a 30-year investment. And half the time, I’m stupid.” So that could be
quite damaging that it’s so unpredictable.
</p>
<h3>
On why green premiums are so important:
</h3>
<p>
I’ve said very clearly that, unless you get green premiums to zero,
you’ll never get adoption in the middle-income countries. The low-income
countries are small numbers, and you can subsidize them — maybe, in some
cases, you should. But [you can’t] in the middle-income countries —
that’s India, China, Brazil, Vietnam. You know, humanity lives in
middle-income countries, and thank God, it’s the opposite of what it was
in the 1960s, when there were almost no middle-income countries and
there was this rich, Europe-U.S. piece.
</p>
<p>
So yes, we have to make solar, fission, fusion, storage, cement, steel,
beef — we’ve got to make them at, ideally, <em>negative</em> green
premiums, but at least at zero green premiums. Otherwise, you never get
adoption.
</p>
<p>
Now, technology can go through a period where it has a green premium.
And then you’re asking rich countries, rich companies, rich people to
create the demand signal to get on the learning curve, like was done
with solar. Breakthrough [Energy] only works on technologies that, once
they’re down the learning curve, have zero or negative green premiums.
At the Paris talks, there was almost no focus on the hard to abate
areas. Even though it won’t achieve 1.5 [degrees Celsius of warming] and
probably won’t achieve 2 [degrees Celsius], the fact that we kicked that
off, and there are more companies than I would have expected with cool
ideas — many of which will fail, you know — that’s more than I thought
we’d have eight years ago.
</p>
<h3>
On whether global carbon emissions will start rising again in 2060 due
to massive economic growth in Asia and Africa, as a recent study from an
energy research firm, the Rhodium Group, projected:
</h3>
<p>
Rhodium is not assuming there’s a cheap fission reactor. Once you get to
2060, predicting the costs of things… I mean, even fusion. We will
probably have extremely economic fusion by then.

rate makes a difference</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Average mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest levels since August,
cooling from nearly 8% to around 7%. While that may be more manageable
for prospective homebuyers, rates are still significantly higher than
they’ve been in decades. What will this mean for home sales and
refinancing? Plus, EV tax credits are getting complicated, and we hear
about the olive oil crisis playing out in Spain.

<h2 id="why-we-want-feeds-in-bluesky">Why we want feeds in Bluesky</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
My old friend
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+%22chuck+shotton%22">Chuck
Shotton</a> just
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrwheat.bsky.social">showed up</a> on
Bluesky.
</p>
<p>
I love Chuck. We’ve been through a lot together over a long time.
</p>
<p>
We had a ton of fun in the early days of the web on the Mac. Chuck wrote
the HTTP server we all used. And he loved Frontier, so we made our
products work incredibly well together.
</p>
<p>
Those were the days! <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
Anyway, of course I immediately followed Chuck in Bluesky, but then I
realize, I can also follow him
<a href="https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Amrwheat.bsky.social">in
FeedLand</a> because thanks to John Spurlock,
<a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:mrwheat.bsky.social">we
have feeds</a> for every freaking Bluesky user.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+spurlock">Spurlock</a>
is a gifted programmer, like Chuck, who thinks creatively and doesn’t
mind priming the pump of a bootstrap, something Chuck and I have done
many times in the past. (Chuck is an largely uncredited contributor to
the bootstraps of RSS, XML-RPC, podcasting, object databases, content
management systems, hey pretty much everything I’ve worked on since 1994
or so.)
</p>
<p>
Okay, now I get to the point.
</p>
<p>
I want to build with confidence on the feed connection with Bluesky.
Today I know the ability to
<a href="https://feedland.com/?feedurl=https%3A%2F%2Frss.firesky.tv%2F%3Ffilter%3Dfrom%3Ascripting.com">subscribe</a>
to a <a href="https://rss.firesky.tv/?filter=from:scripting.com">Bluesky
RSS 2.0 feed</a> is there, but will it be there in the future? I would
feel better if the feed support were built-into Bluesky, part of its
basic feature set. Another very simple API that gets ideas out of
Bluesky and anywhere feeds go, which is, as you know, everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Feeds should be the baseline of compatibility between social media
platforms.
</p>
<p>
Working with Spurlock, we have given Bluesky a huge headstart, a lead in
what I hope will be a race to feed support in all the social media apps,
to hook them up to the worldwide feed bus. It’s a way to get interop
without having to concede that any comprehensive API is the winner.
Think of RSS 2.0 support at the TCP of social networking, offering a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator">LCD</a>
compatibility to a world that desperately needs one.
</p>
<p>
And then after we have that, we can talk about the format of the data
we’re sending over this network. We have some work to do there too, but
luckily the capabilities and limits of RSS 2.0 are a perfect match here.
</p>
<p>
In summary, the reason we want it is so we can do more with confidence
with Bluesky, integrate it into more systems.
</p>
<p>
The reason the Bluesky people should want it is that it offers a way to
interop with all social nets, that will take almost no effort on their
part, and there’s no guesswork, we already know how to make feeds that
will work pretty much everywhere, and it lets them take the lead in what
will be an important way to communicate on the net.
</p>
<p>
And the reason it’s good for all of us is we can start viewing the web
once again as a fully supported writing environment, and let the writers
of the world get to work on solving all our problems (of which we have
many) and get the freaking technology out of their way.
</p>
<p>
Think of it as the feed-iverse, it’s easier and more low-level than the
fed-iverse, and can be implemented in a weekend. And it’s fun!

<p><strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Dave">@Dave</span> Winer’s
Scripting News</strong> (date: 2023-12-07, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting
News)</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corollary">corrollary</a> to
the <a href="http://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> philosophy is that
I should be able to use any writing tool I like to post to the web, and
have it flow where ever I want. The idea of being forced to use a teeny
little edit box to write my wonderful prose is as silly as bunding a
word processor with a printer, and forcing you to use that editor if you
want to print it with that printer. If I sent you a document written for
my Brand X printer but you had Brand Y, sorry – you can’t read it. I’m
at the point in my life where I have to explain to young folk how great
things were when I was their age, but it’s true in this case, when I was
in my 20s and 30s, there were simple standards for text, and you could
print documents produced by any writing tool on any printer. And as a
result a wide variety of writing tools and editors were available, and
there was lots of innovation in a very short period of time because
everyone had competition they could learn from and had to keep up with.
Now there’s no reason for Twitter, Facebook, Threads, Instagram,
Bluesky, Mastodon or whatever to improve their editors because after all
you don’t have any choice. That’s another important facet of textcasting
that we borrow from podcasting – lots of ways to create and lots of ways
to listen mean things <i>can</i> get better. With lock-in, they
can’t.</p>

id="pluralistic-an-adversarial-imessage-client-for-android-07-dec-2023">Pluralistic:
An adversarial iMessage client for Android (07 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links An adversarial iMessage client for Android: Beeper Mini
preserves end-to-end encryption and doesn’t require an Apple ID. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008,
2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances,
current writing projects, current reading An adversarial iMessage client
for Android (permalink) Adversarial interoperability is one of the most
reliable ways to protect tech users from predatory corporations: that’s
when a technologist reverse-engineers an existing product to reconfigure
or mod it (interoperability) in ways its users like, but which its
manufacturer objects to (adversarial):
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability
“Adversarial interop” is a mouthful, so at EFF, we coined the term
“competitive compatibility,” or comcom, which is a lot easier to say and
to spell. Scratch any tech success and you’ll find a comcom story. After
all, when a company turns its screws on its users, it’s good business to
offer an aftermarket mod that loosens them again. HP’s $10,000/gallon
inkjet ink is like a bat-signal for third-party ink companies. When
Mercedes announces that it’s going to sell you access to your car’s
accelerator pedal as a subscription service, that’s like an engraved
invitation to clever independent mechanics who’ll charge you a single
fee to permanently unlock that “feature”:
https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/05/carmakers-push-forward-with-plans-to-make-basic-features-subscription-services-despite-widespread-backlash/
Comcom saved giant tech companies like Apple. Microsoft tried to kill
the Mac by rolling out a truly cursèd version of MS Office for MacOS.
Mac users (5% of the market) who tried to send Word, Excel or Powerpoint
files to Windows users (95% of the market) were stymied: their files
wouldn’t open, or they’d go corrupt. Tech managers like me started
throwing the graphic designer’s Mac and replacing it with a Windows box
with a big graphics card and Windows versions of Adobe’s tools. Comcom
saved Apple’s bacon. Apple reverse-engineered MS’s flagship software
suite and made a comcom version, iWork, whose Pages, Numbers and Keynote
could flawlessly read and write MS’s Word, Excel and Powerpoint files:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/adversarial-interoperability-reviving-elegant-weapon-more-civilized-age-slay
It’s tempting to think of iWork as benefiting Apple users, and certainly
the people who installed and used it benefited from it. But Windows
users also benefited from iWork. The existence of iWork meant that
Windows users could seamlessly collaborate on and share files with their
Mac colleagues. IWork didn’t just add a new feature to the Mac (“read
and write files that originated with Windows users”) – it also added a
feature to Windows: “collaborate with Mac users.” Every pirate wants to
be an admiral. Though comcom rescued Apple from a monopolist’s sneaky
attempt to drive it out of business, Apple – now a three trillion dollar
company – has repeatedly attacked comcom when it was applied to Apple’s
products. When Apple did comcom, that was progress. When someone does
comcom to Apple, that’s piracy. Apple has many tools at its disposal
that Microsoft lacked in the early 2000s. Radical new interpretations of
existing copyright, contract, patent and trademark law allows Apple –
and other tech giants – to threaten rivals who engage in comcom with
both criminal and civil penalties. That’s right, you can go to prison
for comcom these days. No wonder Jay Freeman calls this “felony contempt
of business model”:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/09/lead-me-not-into-temptation/#chamberlain
Take iMessage, Apple’s end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) instant messaging
tool. Apple customers can use iMessage to send each other private
messages that can’t be read or altered by third parties – not cops, not
crooks, not even Apple. That’s important, because when private messaging
systems get hacked, bad things happen:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_celebrity_nude_photo_leak But Apple
has steadfastly refused to offer an iMessage app for non-Apple systems.
If you’re an Apple customer holding a sensitive discussion with an
Android user, Apple refuses to offer you a tool to maintain your
privacy. Those messages are sent “in the clear,” over the 38-year-old
SMS protocol, which is trivial to spy on and disrupt. Apple sacrifices
its users’ security and integrity in the hopes that they will put
pressure on their friends to move into Apple’s walled garden. As CEO Tim
Cook told a reporter: if you want to have secure communications with
your mother, buy her an iPhone:
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tim-cook-says-buy-mom-210347694.html Last
September, a 16-year old high school student calling himself JJTech
published a technical teardown of iMessage, showing how any device could
send and receive encrypted messages with iMessage users, even without an
Apple ID: https://jjtech.dev/reverse-engineering/imessage-explained/
JJTech even published code to do this, in an open source library called
Pypush: https://github.com/JJTech0130/pypush In the weeks since, Beeper
has been working to productize JJTech’s code, and this week, they
announced Beeper Mini, an Android-based iMessage client that is
end-to-end encrypted:
https://beeper.notion.site/How-Beeper-Mini-Works-966cb11019f8444f90baa314d2f43a54
Beeper is known for a multiprotocol chat client built on Matrix,
allowing you to manage several kinds of chat from a single app. These
multiprotocol chats have been around forever. Indeed, iMessage started
out as one – when it was called “iChat,” it supported Google Talk and
Jabber, another multiprotocol tool. Other tools like Pidgin have kept
the flame alive for decades, and have millions of devoted users:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/07/tower-babel-how-public-interest-internet-trying-save-messaging-and-banish-big
But iMessage support has remained elusive. Last month, Nothing launched
Sunchoice, a disastrous attempt to bring iMessage to Android, which used
Macs in a data-center to intercept and forward messages to Android
users, breaking E2EE and introducing massive surveillance risks:
https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/21/23970740/sunbird-imessage-app-shut-down-privacy-nothing-chats-phone-2
Beeper Mini does not have these defects. The system encrypts and
decrypts messages on the Android device itself, and directly
communicates with Apple’s servers. It gathers some telemetry for
debugging, and this can be turned off in preferences. It sends a single
SMS to Apple’s servers during setup, which changes your device’s bubble
from green to blue, so that Apple users now correctly see your device as
a secure endpoint for iMessage communications. Beeper Mini is now
available in Google Play:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beeper.ima&amp;amp;hl=en_US
Now, this is a high-stakes business. Apple has a long history of
threatening companies like Beeper over conduct like this. And Google has

But while iMessage for Android is good for Android users, it’s also very
good for Apple customers, who can now get the privacy and security
guarantees of iMessage for all their contacts, not just the ones who
bought the same kind of phone as they did. The stakes for communications
breaches have never been higher, and antitrust scrutiny on Big Tech
companies has never been so intense. Apple recently announced that it
would add RCS support to iOS devices (RCS is a secure successor to SMS):
https://9to5mac.com/2023/11/16/apple-rcs-coming-to-iphone/ Early word
from developers suggests that this support will have all kinds of
boobytraps. That’s par for the course with Apple, who love to announce
splashy reversals of their worst policies – like their opposition to
right to repair – while finding sneaky ways to go on abusing its
customers:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently The
ball is in Apple’s court, and, to a lesser extent, in Google’s. As part
of the mobile duopoly, Google has joined with Apple in facilitating the
removal of comcom tools from its app store. But Google has also spent
millions on an ad campaign shaming Apple for exposing its users to
privacy risks when talking to Android users:

up on Beeper Mini, and technologists can kick the tires on its code

poisoned our minds with the idea that by taking away the basic features
of writing on the web they were encouraging people to write shorter,
better, more to-the-point posts and that would make communication on the
web like poetry. It was a very zen-like mystical idea, and imho totally
wrong. And it’s still repeated as if it were gospel – it’s a typical
response when I beg for a standard that is more realistic, that
incorporates the <a href="http://textcasting.org/">basic features of web
writing</a>: simple styles, links, optional titles, enclosures, the
ability to edit and unlimited length. The fallacy of this response is
that you are free to write however you want, if you feel your ideas are
better communicated in short messages, go ahead. I want to use all the
tools in my writing. And if you don’t want to read all that I write or
any of it, there are tools that make that easy. So everyone wins, and
you don’t have to try to impose your ideas of religiously pure writing
on anyone but yourself.</p>

new SAG contract say about AI use?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Members of SAG-AFTRA voted to ratify a contract with Hollywood studios
following the recent months-long actors strike. A major concern for
voting members was how and when artificial intelligence could be used.
While actors won some protections regarding AI usage, some still feel
the deal fell short. We’ll also hear about a ban on Russian diamond
imports and examine claims of organized theft at stores.

<li>A quick COP recap
</h3>
<p>
It’s a “rest day” at COP28, which means there probably won’t be a ton of
news coming out of Dubai. But now’s a good time to reflect on what’s
happened so far, and what to expect as the conference enters its second
half. <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Key accomplishments:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Loss and damage fund: </strong>On day one of COP28, world
leaders reached a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-loss-damage-reparations-fund" target="_self">landmark
deal</a> to set up a fund aimed at helping vulnerable nations deal with
the costly effects of climate change. The early accomplishment set an
optimistic tone for the summit. <em>The Guardian</em>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/06/700m-pledged-to-loss-and-damage-fund-cop28-covers-less-than-02-percent-needed" target="_blank">notes</a>
that wealthy countries have so far pledged $700 million to the fund,
which is “far short of what is needed.”

<li>
<strong>Methane cuts:</strong> About 50 oil and gas companies

to slash their methane leaks by 2030.

to 24 after Spain, Kenya, and Samoa joined the Beyond Oil &amp; Gas
Alliance.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Global cooling pledge:</strong> 63 countries including the U.S.
and Canada have

earnest</a>” tomorrow about the key document that will set out the
world’s climate goals for the coming years, and determine how they’ll be
accomplished. The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-fossil-fuels-phaseout" target="_self">most
contentious issue</a> is whether the stocktake will include a call for a

<li>U.S. solar capacity to hit record high in 2023
</h3>
<p>
The U.S. added 6.5 gigawatts (GW) of new solar capacity in the third
quarter of 2023, up 35% year-over-year, according to a new
<a href="https://www.seia.org/us-solar-market-insight%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a>
published this morning from the Solar Energy Industries Association
(SEIA) and Wood Mackenzie. The report projects that in 2023 the U.S.
will add a total of 33 GW of solar capacity, a 55% increase compared to
new capacity in 2022. Growth is expected to slow slightly next year as
the industry runs up against

headwinds</a>, but the dip will be temporary. By 2028, U.S. solar
capacity is expected to reach 377 GW, up from 161 GW now, and solar is
“still expected to be the largest source of generating capacity on the
U.S. grid by 2050,” <em>Electrek</em>
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/12/06/us-solar-records-in-2023-2024-road-bumps/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.
The authors urge the industry to “continue to innovate to maximize the
value that solar brings to an increasingly complex grid.”

<li>Vivek Ramaswamy calls climate agenda a ‘substitute for modern
religion’ in GOP debate
</h3>
<p>
“The woke climate agenda” emerged as a villain at the fourth GOP debate
on Wednesday night,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-weave-a-climate-conspiracy-at-the-final-debate" target="_self">reports</a>
Heatmap’s Jeva Lange. The topic first lurched on stage in the form of
Republicans’ favorite three-letter boogeyman, ESG. Florida Governor Ron
DeSantis called ESG investing an attempt to use “economic power to
impose a left-wing agenda on this country.” Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki
Haley alleged that DeSantis is beholden to Chinese companies like
“JinkoSolar,” which he supposedly gave “$2 million in subsidies.” And in
his closing remarks, Vivek Ramaswamy really let loose: “We should not be
bending the knee to this new religion! That’s what it is, a substitute
for a modern religion! We are flogging ourselves! And losing our modern
way of life! Bowing to this new god of climate! And that will end on my
watch!”

<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2023/12/05/brightline-west-high-speed-rail-grant/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a>.
The project is expected to cost $12 billion in total and be completed in
just four years, in time for the 2028 Olympic Games in L.A. Trains will
travel at 186 miles per hour and transport commuters in about 2 hours –
roughly half the driving time. “This is a historic moment that will
serve as a foundation for a new industry, and a remarkable project that
will serve as the blueprint for how we can repeat this model throughout
the country,” Wes Edens, the founder and chairman of Brightline, said in
a statement.

<li>Panama Canal bottleneck could affect Christmas shipments
</h3>
<p>
Reduced capacity for container ships in the Panama Canal due to ongoing
drought in the region could cause a bottleneck that turns into “the
Pinch that Stole Christmas,”
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-12-05/panama-canal-drought-is-a-headache-for-global-trade-at-christmas?sref=a2d7LMhq" target="_blank">says</a>
<em>Bloomberg</em>’s Tim Culpan. Daily crossings have already been
reduced from 36 to 25 and will be cut further to just 18 by February.
Container vessels, which carry everything from cars to Christmas toys,
are being hit especially hard. “After the drought made the canal
shallower, ships now have to lighten their loads,” Cuplan explains. “The
result is fewer containers making the crossing per day, heightening the
chance that many goods won’t make it to their destinations in time for
Christmas.”

<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service</em>: Italian Prime Minister Giorgia
Meloni’s administration is pulling out of China’s flagship Belt and Road
Initiative, the massive  infrastructure and trade project. This is
leading to fears that Italy’s $20 billion export market into China could
be threatened. Plus, G7 countries look to sanction Russian diamonds.
Then, in Spain, a poor harvest is causing a shortage of olive oil and
pushing prices up.

In a statement, Apple said that Wyden’s letter gave them the opening

id="generative-ai-may-need-news-organizations-journalism-to-succeed">Generative
AI May Need News Organizations, Journalism to Succeed</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In the year since Open AI introduced ChatGPT to the world, almost 600
media organizations have blocked the technology from scraping their
content. </p>
<p>Two other AI chat bots — Google AI’s Bard and Common Crawl’s CCBot —
are also blocked by some or most of those same news organizations.</p>
<p>The list grows longer each day, according to Ben Welsh, a news
applications editor for Reuters, who compiled a survey of news
organizations for his media blog. </p>
<p>“What we are seeing here is that news publishers, at least half of
them in my survey, want to put the brakes on this a little bit and not
just allow themselves to be included in this without some sort of
conversation or negotiation with the Open AI company,” Welsh said. </p>
<p>Open AI, the creator of ChatGPT, offered 1,153 news organizations the
option to block its chat bot in August 2023. As of Wednesday, nearly
half have taken up that offer.   </p>
<p>While most are U.S. organizations, including The New York Times and
CNN, the list also includes international media groups, including
Australia’s ABC News, The Times of India, and The South African.   </p>
<p>Welsh’s survey didn’t dig deeply into the reasons for blocking
ChatGPT, but he said that commercial media tend to be among the groups
that stop ChatGPT whereas nonprofits are more likely to share content.
 </p>
<p>VOA’s attempts to contact ChatGPT via LinkedIn, email and at its
offices in San Francisco were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Seen as threat  </p>
<p>Many media analysts and press freedom groups see AI as a threat to
publishers and broadcasters, as well as a threat to ethical
journalism. </p>
<p>Among the chief concerns are the use of artificial intelligence to
create false narratives and fake visuals and to amplify misinformation
and disinformation. </p>
<p>“It is clearly possible that some groups or organizations use and
fine-tune models to create tailored disinformation that suits their
projects or their purpose,” said Vincent Berthier, who manages the
technology desk at Reporters Without Borders, or RSF. “But right now,
today, the higher risk of disinformation comes from generative AI from
pictures and deep fakes.” </p>
<p>RSF organized a commission made up of 32 journalism and AI experts,
led by Nobel laureate and disinformation expert Maria Ressa, to regulate
how media use the technology.  </p>
<p>The resulting Paris Charter on AI and Journalism, released in
November, sets parameters for the use of AI for news organizations and
makes clear that journalists must take a leading role.   </p>
<p>RSF’s Berthier believes that many of the organizations opting out are
sending a clear message to AI developers. </p>
<p>“What media companies are saying is AI won’t be built without us and
it is exactly RSF’s position on this topic,” Berthier said. “It is the
spirit of the charter we released this month saying that media and
journalism should be part of AI governance.”   </p>
<p>Media freedom is already at risk from Big Tech and social media
algorithms, Berthier said. </p>
<p>“That’s why we fight every day to protect press freedom and just make
sure that journalists can still do their jobs to give the most accurate
information to the public,” he said. </p>
<p>The Associated Press became partners with OpenAI in a news content
and information sharing agreement in July.  </p>
<p>Pamela Samuelson, a MacArthur Fellow, University of
California-Berkeley law professor and information technology expert,
said the deal might be just the beginning of many licensing agreements
and partnerships between AI and journalism.  </p>
<p>But she also predicted that companies would work to develop their own
AI. </p>
<p>“So The New York Times might be doing it, CNN might be doing it, we
just don’t know,” Samuelson said. “They will announce either their own
generative stuff or they will just keep it in house.” </p>
<p>Ethical concerns</p>
<p>As the debate over the use of AI in journalism unfolds, many news
organizations and journalists cite ethical concerns and reservations
about its use.   </p>
<p>Others cite economic factors, such as the use of their copyrighted
materials and unique intellectual property without payment or
provenance.   </p>
<p>But, said Samuelson, “The predictions of doom, doom, doom are
probably overblown.” </p>
<p>“Predictions that everything is going to be perfect, that is probably
wrong, too,” she added. “We will have to find some new
equilibrium.” </p>
<p>Generative AI can write computer code, create art, produce research
and even write news articles. But makers widely admit in disclaimers
that there are problems with its reliability and accuracy.  </p>
<p>There is also growing fear among researchers that a dependence on
generative AI to both produce and access news and information is
spreading and that too often the information being dispensed isn’t
reliable or accurate. </p>
<p>“There is one thing that journalism puts right up at the top of the
list and that’s accuracy and that is a weakness of these tools,” Welsh
said. “While they are incredibly great at being creative and generating
all sorts of interesting outputs, one thing they struggle with is
getting the facts right.” </p>
<p>Some AI analysts and watchers say the growing list of news
organizations blocking AI bots could further affect that quality.</p>

Laser Technology to Help Future NASA Missions to Mars</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A new optical ground station has been built by the Australian
National University to help the U.S. space agency, NASA, and others
explore space and safely reach Mars.</p>
<p>The Australian team has developed a new type of space communication
using lasers.</p>
<p>Researchers say the system will allow them to connect with satellites
and NASA-crewed missions beyond low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>The project is supported by the Australian Space Agency’s Moon to
Mars initiative.</p>
<p>The Australian National University Quantum Optical Ground Station is
based at the Mount Stromlo Observatory, near Canberra.</p>
<p>It is a powerful telescope that will support high-speed advanced
communications with satellites orbiting at distances from low-Earth
orbit to the moon.</p>
<p>Kate Ferguson, associate director for strategic projects at the
Australian National University Institute for Space, told VOA current
communication systems relying on radio frequencies can be slow and
cumbersome.</p>
<p>“I am sure some of us remember the grainy pictures that we got of the
moon landing that came from the Apollo era,” Ferguson said. “So, again
the current radio frequency systems, they have these much slower data
rates and especially over really long distances.  For space exploration
those become very slow but with optical communications we will be able
to increase the rate of that communication.”</p>
<p>She said the new system, based on powerful lasers that are invisible
to the naked eye, will transform communications in space.</p>
<p>“What we are aiming to do is to be able to receive high-definition
video from future crewed missions. Not only will that be great for us
here on Earth, seeing what is happening with the astronauts on these
types of missions, but it will improve the connectivity between those
missions,” she said. “And what we are doing here is optical
communication, which uses laser beams to communicate and these offer
much higher speeds and increased security over the current systems and
this is really important for us to be getting that data down and being
able to use it here on Earth.”</p>
<p>Scientists say the Australian-developed systems will be compatible
with NASA missions.</p>
<p>They say the laser-based technology will improve astronauts’ ability
to connect with Earth from the moon and also allow high-definition video
to be sent from the moon and Mars.</p>
<p>NASA has said previously that astronauts could be sent on a mission
to the red planet by the mid-to-late 2030s.</p>

<h2 id="the-personality-of-a-personal-website">The personality of a
personal website</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
With his
“<a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">I
am a poem I am not software</a>” post
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/thoughts/pb-robin-rendle">Robin</a>
touched on an interesting problem related to personal websites. I’m not
going to summarise Robin’s post because his writing is great and you
should read his words on his blog.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
what should our personal websites do? Should we prioritize getting a new
gig or selling a service? Or can we be ourselves? Weird and fun and
peculiar? Should we talk about topic X but avoid topic Y?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
These are all very interesting questions but for me, the more pressing
question is a slightly different one: which <em>you</em> is your
personal site representing? We often don’t pay too much attention to
this but we all have different ways of being ourselves.
</p>
<p>
So which one of these should my site represent? Should my site be the
personal site of the Manu freelance web developer, with his interests in
digital typography, minimal design, and simple websites? Or should
represent the slightly competitive on the basketball court Manu, who
doesn’t really care all that much about winning but is concerned about
having fun? Or maybe it should represent Manu the romantic partner, with
all his worry about the practical aspects of life but also full of
affection for his partner? The list goes on and on.
</p>
<p>
All of these “me” have a different way of communicating because they all
live in different parts of my life. Which one should this site
represent? Hard to say.
</p>
<p>
Personal sites—and, more broadly, our digital lives—are a mirror of who
we are. Some of us will try to neatly organize everything under one
hyper-curated digital roof while others will scatter things around on 12
different domains and 24 services. Some will design a site for
themselves and not touch it again for a decade while others will feel
the need to redesign every 6 months. Those are all right answers to a
question that doesn’t have wrong answers.
</p>
<p>
A personal site is—or at least it should be—a reflection of whoever you
want to be. It could be the complete you, one of the many versions of
you, or even an aspirational you. Just be comfortable in your digital
home. It’s all that matters.

Weave a Climate Conspiracy at the Final Debate of 2023</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDY4NTM0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxMzE4NDczOH0.rmIs1P81sEFWANIoCPHJuNEDtk5Ib2-ImIv7yea2BBg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Who, or what, was the biggest villain of the fourth Republican debate?
Vivek
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/12/06/us/republican-debate-presidential-news/ba5bab9f-4675-5dd0-b390-06931a51d587?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The
Most Obnoxious Blowhard in America</a>” Ramaswamy would, of course, be
an easy pick. So too would “the three previous Republican debates,”
which were all
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-fracking-environmentalist-gop-debate" target="_self">so
painfully boring</a> that most Americans probably didn’t bother to
investigate if Wednesday’s host network, News Nation, was actually a
real channel. (Whadda you know, it is!).
</p>
<p>
But there was another villain, too: a shadowy threat that, you’d think
from the tone on stage, imperils nothing less than American freedom, our
values, and everything we love. And no, it wasn’t Donald Trump. It was,
<em>shudder</em>, the woke climate agenda.
</p>
<p>
The topic first lurched on stage in the form of Republicans’
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/esg-hearing-congress-oversight-weird" target="_self">favorite
three-letter boogeyman</a>, ESG. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis took an
opportunity to brag that he pulled $2 billion in Floridian pensions from
Blackrock “when they did the ESG.”
</p>
<p>
“This ESG,” he went on, “they call it ‘environment, social, governance’
… they want to use economic power to impose a left-wing agenda on this
country. They want basically to change society without having to go
through the constitutional process.”
</p>
<p>
But that boogeyman doesn’t look quite as scary when you turn the lights
on. While it’s true that DeSantis targeted ESG as part of his crusade
against “woke capitalism,”
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-26/blackrock-retains-florida-s-billions-as-desantis-wages-esg-fight" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg
</em>noted in January</a> that
</p>
<blockquote>
…[t]he Florida State Board of Administration — which oversees roughly
$180 billion in pension money — didn’t hold investments labeled as ESG
when DeSantis ramped up his campaign last year, according to data
compiled by <em>Bloomberg</em>. Even after the state’s treasury said it
would pull $2 billion from BlackRock amid DeSantis’s criticism, the
world’s largest asset manager still oversees $12.9 billion for the
state’s retirement funds.
</blockquote>
<p>
Okay, well, the nefarious climate agenda must be hiding elsewhere? Sure
enough, a little later in the debate, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley
alleged that DeSantis is beholden to Chinese companies like
“JinkoSolar,” which he supposedly gave “$2 million in subsidies.”
</p>
<p>
Sounds ominous! But a closer look also revealed the facts to be a little
less exciting: “JinkoSolar predates DeSantis,”
<a href="https://www.wmfe.org/politics/2023-11-22/politifact-florida-nikki-haley-ron-desantis-chinese-recruitment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PolitiFact
explained</a> after Haley tried a similar line of attack during a
November appearance on <em>Fox &amp; Friends</em>. Besides, “state
governments typically lack the authority to bar an established business
from making operational decisions, unless those businesses are breaking
the law” and “JinkoSolar hasn’t been charged with a crime.” PolitiFact
rated the whole attack as “false.”
</p>
<p>
Reference to the dark conspiracy of the climate agenda surfaced a third
and final time during the debate in the form of Ramaswamy’s closing
remarks. Ramaswamy has long railed against what he calls the “climate
change agenda,”
<a href="https://time.com/6309085/6309085/" target="_blank">presumably
climate policy</a>, calling it a “hoax.” But he used his final minutes
on the mic before a national audience on Wednesday to warn that it’s
also a <em>false idol. </em>“If you thought COVID was bad, what’s coming
next with this climate agenda is far worse!” he insisted. “We should not
be bending the knee to this new religion! That’s what it is, a
substitute for a modern religion! We are flogging ourselves! And losing
our modern way of life! Bowing to this new god of climate! And that will
end on my watch!”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you. Ambassador Haley?” Megyn Kelly transitioned, evidently
unruffled.
</p>
<p>
Admittedly, it’s hard to take Ramaswamy’s alarm (or, well, Ramaswamy
himself) seriously. But for those watching closely — which, again, it’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-fracking-environmentalist-gop-debate" target="_blank">more
than understandable</a> if you’re not! — a clear pattern is beginning to
emerge. Republican candidates are attempting to divorce the actual
climate agenda from the “<em>cLiMAte AgENda</em>,” a made-up specter
they can scare their base with, the same way they previously weaponized
and rendered meaningless words like
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/texas-schools-climate-change-fossil-fuels" target="_blank">critical
race theory</a>” and “woke.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>But if that doesn’t frighten you, you know what is
<em>really </em>spooky? The Iowa caucuses are less than six weeks away.

Clears Path for Tribal Nations to Access Federal Funds</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said Wednesday that his administration is
committed to writing “a new and better chapter of history” for its more
than 570 native communities by, among other things, making it easier for
them to access federal funding.</p>
<p>“It’s hard work to heal the wrongs of the past and change the course
and move forward,” Biden said. “But the actions we’re taking today are
key steps into that new era of tribal sovereignty and
self-determination. A new era grounded in dignity and respect, that
recognizes your fundamental rights to govern and grow on your own terms.
That’s what this summit is all about.”</p>
<p>Biden, speaking at the U.S. Department of the Interior, which sits on
the ancestral land of the Nacotchtank people, announced more than 190
agreements during a two-day summit of some 300 tribal leaders.</p>
<p>They include an executive order that will make it easier to access
federal funding, plus efforts to clean up nuclear sites, support clean
energy transitions and work toward the repatriation of native remains
and sacred objects.</p>
<p>The administration will also release a progress report on its efforts
to date.</p>
<p>Hope for more</p>
<p>The leader of one of the largest groups told VOA that the
government’s efforts have been “very, very positive” and said he hoped
to see more.</p>
<p>“The most important thing for the Cherokee Nation, I think — and all
tribes — is the efficient deployment of resources, and then allowing
tribes to decide how to use those resources,” said Chuck Hoskin Jr.,
principal chief of the Cherokee Nation.</p>
<p>But, he said, as his people know too well, land dispossession and
conflict is not ancient history. Here’s his advice to Biden and Middle
Eastern leaders as war rages in Gaza after the October 7 attack by Hamas
militants:</p>
<p>“We have a history of being dispossessed from our land,” he said.
“And so, I would just say, remind people that there’s a way to balance
rights. I think we’re trying to do that in the United States in terms of
Indian Country versus the rest of the country.</p>
<p>“We haven’t perfected it, but I think we’re making some progress,”
Hoskin said. “So, all I would say is the respect and dignity that every
human being deserves ought to be on display.”</p>
<p>Youth see potential</p>
<p>Younger tribal citizens say they have high expectations. Sareya
Taylor, the inaugural Youth Poet Laureate of Phoenix, is a member of the
White Mountain Apache and Navajo communities.</p>
<p>“I voted for Biden in 2020,” said Taylor, 21. “And I believe there’s
so much more that can be done, especially in terms of climate and how we
look at food sovereignty.”</p>
<p>But if she could ask the president for anything, she said, it would
be for a cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>“As an Indigenous person, I see my history, like, being like,
livestreamed right now,” she said. “If that were happening to us, I’d
like to believe that it would be stopped immediately. But you know,
considering President Biden won’t even call for a cease-fire, I don’t
know about that.”</p>
<p>Hoskin, who is nearly three decades older than Taylor, took a more
measured view.</p>
<p>“Obviously, if these were easy issues, somebody would have solved
them a long time ago,” he said.</p>
<p>But, he said, step by step, the U.S. government is working to right
past wrongs on its own soil.</p>
<p>“Certainly, it would be accurate to say the United States has an
appalling record towards Indigenous peoples,” he said. “Is it perfect
now? No, it’s not. But we’re making progress.”</p>

Republican Presidential Candidates Face Off in Fiery Debate</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Four Republican candidates sparred for two hours Wednesday – at times
attacking and yelling over each other – in the fourth and final
presidential debate of the year. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump was
absent, as he has been for the three previous debates.</p>
<p>That did not stop former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie from
criticizing the former president and accusing the others of being too
afraid to do so. Trump, despite facing 91 felony counts and a civil
lawsuit, remains substantially ahead of his rivals, according to opinion
polls.</p>

<p>Two months after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, the Republican
candidates agreed Israel should be allowed to conduct its own war
against the group without interference from the United States.</p>
<p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis asserted “This administration is trying
to hobble Israel from being able to defend itself,” calling out Hamas
for wanting “a second Holocaust.”</p>
<p>The governor also suggested cutting off oil revenue to Iran, saying
they “send it to Hamas… to Hezbollah, and they foment jihad throughout
the Middle East.”</p>
<p>Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Russian President Vladimir
Putin is thrilled that America has redirected its attention from Ukraine
to Israel, saying “There is a reason that Taiwanese want to help
Ukrainians because they know if Ukraine wins, China won’t invade
Taiwan.”</p>
<p>She made the same comparison with Ukrainians who want to help the
Israelis, “because they know that if Iran wins, Russia wins … but what
wins all of that is a strong America, not a weak America. And that’s
what [President] Joe Biden has given us.”</p>
<p>Christie, asked in the NewsNation debate if he would send in U.S.
troops to free the American hostages held by Hamas and other militants,
said, “You’re damn right I would send the American army in there to get
them out safely.”</p>
<p>Southern border and fentanyl</p>
<p>On fentanyl entering the U.S. through the southern border,
entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy said he would have had a different
conversation with China’s leader than President Biden and would “tell Xi
Jinping you will not only not buy land in this country or donate to
universities,” but also say, “U.S. businesses won’t expand into the
Chinese market” until China stops manufacturing fentanyl for the Mexican
cartels.</p>
<p>DeSantis said he wants cartels categorized as “foreign terrorist
organizations” and added the he will build a wall at the border to
discourage entry, but unlike former President Trump, would get Mexico to
pay for it. Haley would “end all normal trade relationships with China,”
pointing to the country as the source of the drug.</p>
<p>Attacking the former president</p>
<p>A Messenger/Harris poll indicates that among Republican voters former
President Donald Trump leads his competitors with support from 68% of
those surveyed, followed by DeSantis at 9% and Haley at 7%. Ramaswamy
garnered 4%, while Christie and former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson,
who qualified to participate only in the first of the four debates but
officially remains in the race, were at  1% or less.</p>
<p>The candidates attempted Wednesday to distinguish themselves from the
former president, should he not run or not be able to run due to his
court cases.</p>
<p>Kaivan Shroff, political commentator and press secretary for Dream
for America, says the candidates missed the chance to “attack the real
frontrunner in the race. Only Chris Christie did so.”</p>
<p>Christie had called Trump an “angry, bitter man who wants to be back
as president because he wants to enact retribution on anyone who has
disagreed with him.”</p>
<p>Shroff warned that “Haley and DeSantis showed they were too cowardly
to make the case against Trump in this final debate of the year and they
will pay the price.”</p>
<p>Ramaswamy took a swipe at the former and current presidents as well
as his on-stage rivals, saying “It is going to take a leader from the
outside with fresh legs from the next generation to unite this
country.”</p>
<p>On to the first official challenge: Iowa in January</p>
<p>The first voting on the 2024 presidential campaign calendar is the
Iowa Republican caucus on January 15. Analysts say Ramaswamy could be
the most vulnerable candidate at this point, especially after some sharp
personal barbs at his rivals Wednesday night evoked boos from the
audience.</p>
<p>“I think he has hit the apex of his candidacy,” said Andra Gillespie
with the Department of Political Science at Georgia’s Emory University.
Gillespie called Ramaswamy a “novelty” given his lack of elective
experience. “It just becomes a question of ‘how long can he sustain this
candidacy?’”</p>
<p>Meantime, Christie has said he will stay in the race. Gillespie
expects him to compete through the New Hampshire primary on January 23
“or until he runs out of money.”</p>
<p>99 counties</p>
<p>Saturday, DeSantis completed his tour of all 99 counties in Iowa,
courting voters in the Midwest state ahead of the caucuses. The latest
poll averages posted by the website 538 Wednesday show Trump leading in
Iowa by 45.9% to DeSantis’s 19.7%, Haley’s 17.5% Ramaswamy’s 4.8% and
Christie’s 3.9%.</p>

Sued for Allegedly Failing to Shield Children From Predators</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram fail to protect underage users from exposure
to child sexual abuse material and let adults solicit pornographic
imagery from them, New Mexico’s attorney general alleges in a lawsuit
that follows an undercover online investigation.</p>
<p>“Our investigation into Meta’s social media platforms demonstrates
that they are not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations
for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex,”
Attorney General Raul Torrez said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>The civil lawsuit filed late Tuesday against Meta Platforms Inc. in
state court also names its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, as a defendant.</p>
<p>In addition, the suit claims Meta “harms children and teenagers
through the addictive design of its platform, degrading users’ mental
health, their sense of self-worth and their physical safety,” Torrez’s
office said in a statement.</p>
<p>Those claims echo others in a lawsuit filed in late October by the
attorneys general of 33 states, including California and New York,
against Meta that alleges Instagram and Facebook include features
deliberately designed to hook children, contributing to the youth mental
health crisis and leading to depression, anxiety and eating disorders.
New Mexico was not a party to that lawsuit.</p>
<p>Investigators in New Mexico created decoy accounts of children 14
years and younger that Torrez’s office said were served sexually
explicit images even when the child expressed no interest in them. State
prosecutors claim that Meta let dozens of adults find, contact and
encourage children to provide sexually explicit and pornographic
images.</p>
<p>The accounts also received recommendations to join unmoderated
Facebook groups devoted to facilitating commercial sex, investigators
said, adding that Meta also let its users find, share and sell “an
enormous volume of child pornography.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Zuckerberg and other Meta executives are aware of the serious
harm their products can pose to young users, and yet they have failed to
make sufficient changes to their platforms that would prevent the sexual
exploitation of children,” Torrez said, accusing Meta’s executives of
prioritizing “engagement and ad revenue over the safety of the most
vulnerable members of our society.”</p>
<p>Meta, based in Menlo Park, California, did not directly respond to
the New Mexico lawsuit’s allegations, but said it works hard to protect
young users with a serious commitment of resources.</p>
<p>“We use sophisticated technology, hire child safety experts, report
content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and
share information and tools with other companies and law enforcement,
including state attorneys general, to help root out predators,” the
company said. “In one month alone, we disabled more than half a million
accounts for violating our child safety policies.”</p>
<p>Company spokesman Andy Stone pointed to a company report detailing
the millions of tips Facebook and Instagram sent to the National Center
in the third quarter of 2023 — including 48,000 involving inappropriate
interactions that could include an adult soliciting child sexual abuse
material directly from a minor or attempting to meet with one in
person.</p>
<p>Critics, including former employees, have long complained that Meta’s
largely automated content moderation systems are ill-equipped to
identify and adequately eliminate abusive behavior on its platforms.</p>

Military Grounds Entire Osprey Fleet Following Deadly Crash off Coast of
Japan</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The military announced late Wednesday that it was grounding all of
its Osprey V-22 helicopters, one week after eight Air Force Special
Operations Command service members died in a crash off the coast of
Japan.</p>
<p>The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps took the extraordinary step of
grounding hundreds of aircraft after a preliminary investigation of last
week’s crash indicated that a material failure — something went wrong
with the aircraft — and not a mistake by the crew led to the deaths.</p>
<p>The crash raised new questions about the safety of the Osprey, which
has been involved in multiple fatal accidents over its relatively short
time in service. Japan grounded its fleet of 14 Ospreys after the
crash.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Tony Bauernfeind, head of Air Force Special
Operations Command, directed the stand-down “to mitigate risk while the
investigation continues,” the command said in a statement. “Preliminary
investigation information indicates a potential materiel failure caused
the mishap, but the underlying cause of the failure is unknown at this
time.”</p>
<p>In a separate notice, Naval Air Systems Command said it was grounding
all Ospreys. The command is responsible for the Marine Corps and Navy
variants of the aircraft.</p>
<p>The Air Force said it was unknown how long the aircraft would be
grounded. It said the stand-down was expected to remain in place until
the investigation has determined the cause of the Japan crash and made
recommendations to allow the fleet to return to operations.</p>
<p>The U.S.-made Osprey is a hybrid aircraft that takes off and lands
like a helicopter but can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much
faster, like an airplane, during flight. Air Force Special Operations
Command has 51 Ospreys, the U.S. Marine Corps flies more than 400, and
the U.S. Navy operates 27.</p>
<p>The Osprey is still a relatively young plane in the military’s fleet
— the first Ospreys became operational in 2007 after decades of testing.
But more than 50 troops have died either in testing the Osprey or
conducting training flights in the aircraft, including 20 deaths in four
crashes over the past 20 months.</p>
<p>An Osprey accident in August in Australia killed three Marines. That
accident also is still under investigation.</p>

id="fake-trump-electors-settle-lawsuit-in-wisconsin-agree-biden-won">Fake
Trump Electors Settle Lawsuit in Wisconsin, Agree Biden Won</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ten Republicans who posed as fake electors for former U.S. President
Donald Trump in Wisconsin and filed paperwork falsely saying he had won
the battleground state have settled a civil lawsuit and admitted their
actions were part of an effort to overturn President Joe Biden’s
victory, attorneys who filed the case announced Wednesday. </p>
<p>Under the agreement, the fake electors acknowledged that Biden won
the state, withdrew their filings, and agreed not to serve as
presidential electors in 2024 or any other election where Trump is on
the ballot. </p>
<p>The 10 fake electors agreed to send a statement to the government
offices that received the Electoral College votes saying that their
actions were “part of an attempt to improperly overturn the 2020
presidential election results.” </p>
<p>The settlement marks the first time that any Trump electors have
revoked their filings sent to Congress purporting that Trump had won in
seven battleground states. Nevada on Wednesday became the third state to
criminally charge fake electors, following Georgia and Michigan. Trump
faces charges in Georgia and in a federal investigation of his conduct
related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. </p>
<p>The settlement was announced by Law Forward, Georgetown University
Law Center’s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection and
the Madison-based Stafford Rosenbaum law firm. </p>
<p>“Americans believe in democracy and the idea that the people choose
their leaders through elections,” said Jeff Mandell, one of the
attorneys who brought the case on behalf of Democratic voters, including
two who served as Biden electors. “The defendants’ actions violated
those bedrock principles. We brought this case to ensure that they are
held accountable.” </p>
<p>There is no known criminal investigation ongoing in Wisconsin.
Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul has signaled he is relying on
federal investigators to look into what happened in Wisconsin, while
also not ruling out a state probe. </p>
<p>Lawsuit sought $2.4 million</p>
<p>Democrats brought the lawsuit last year seeking $2.4 million in
damages from 10 Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely
declaring Trump as the 2020 election winner in Wisconsin. They also sued
two of Trump’s attorneys, including one who has already pleaded guilty
to other charges stemming from the 2020 election in Georgia. </p>
<p>The case was scheduled to go to a trial by jury in September 2024,
two months before the presidential election. </p>
<p>Under the deal, the fake electors don’t pay any damages or attorneys’
fees, and there is no admission of wrongdoing or liability. </p>
<p>The Wisconsin Republican electors have long said that they were
partaking in the plan in case a court later ruled that Trump had won the
state. One of the fake electors, former Wisconsin state Republican
Chairman Andrew Hitt, repeated that position in a statement
Wednesday. </p>
<p>“The Wisconsin electors were tricked and misled into participating in
what became the alternate elector scheme and would have never taken any
actions had we known that there were ulterior reasons beyond preserving
an ongoing legal strategy,” he said. Hitt said he has been working with
the Justice Department since May of 2022, and he will not be supporting
Trump in 2024. </p>
<p>Fake electors signed fake certificates</p>
<p>The fake elector plan hatched in seven battleground states was
central to the federal indictment filed against Trump earlier in August
that alleged he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal
prosecutors said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Fake electors met in Wisconsin and six other states where Trump was
defeated in 2020 and signed certificates that falsely stated Trump, not
Biden, won their states. The fake certificates were ignored. </p>
<p>One of the attorneys named in the Wisconsin lawsuit, Kenneth
Chesebro, pleaded guilty to a felony charge of conspiracy to commit
filing false documents after being charged with participating in efforts
to overturn Trump’s loss in Georgia. Chesebro was charged alongside
Trump and 17 others with violating the state’s anti-racketeering
law. </p>
<p>The Wisconsin lawsuit cites a memo Chesebro sent to Trump’s attorney
in Wisconsin, Jim Troupis, in November 2020 detailing the elector
plan. </p>
<p>Fake electors agree to help Democrats</p>
<p>Under the settlement, the 10 fake electors promised to assist the
Department of Justice with its ongoing investigation. They also agreed
to help the Democrats as they continue their lawsuit against Troupis and
Chesebro. </p>
<p>Troupis and Chesebro did not return voicemail messages seeking
comment. </p>
<p>The fake electors also released nearly 600 pages of documents related
to their scheme, under terms of the settlement. </p>
<p>Those show one Republican involved with the fake elector plot texting
another one referring to their action declaring Trump the winner of
Wisconsin as a “possible steal.” The sender said they felt compelled to
go along with the plan or else Trump supporters would be upset, and
there “would be a target on my back.” </p>
<p>Government and outside investigations have uniformly found there was
no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the election
from Biden. Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the 2020
election. </p>
<p>Electors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential
elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which
party’s electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in
December after the election to certify the outcome.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>systemd 255 has been released, and it contains one particular new
feature I want to highlight. A new component “systemd-bsod” has been
added to show logged error messages full-screen if they have a
“LOG_EMERG” log level. This is intended as a tool for displaying
emergency log messages full-screen on boot failures. Yes, BSOD in this
case short for “Blue Screen of Death”. This was worked on as part of
Outreachy 2023. The systemd-bsod will also display a QR code for getting
more information on the error causing the boot failure. ↫ Michael
Larabel at Phoronix I like this. Operating systems usually have
excellent logging capabilities, but getting to these logs and making
sense of them isn’t always easy, especially if you’re not elbow-deep in
the weeds of how your operating system of choice works. Giving a useful
error screen when things really hit a brick wall at 200 km/h is a good
thing, and will make at least some troubleshooting easier.</p>

government is using data from push notifications to track contacts</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Government investigators in the United States have used push
notification data to pursue people of interest, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.)
said in a letter Wednesday to the Justice Department, revealing for the
first time a way in which Americans can be tracked through a basic
service provided by their smartphones. Wyden’s letter said the Justice
Department had prohibited Apple and Google from discussing the technique
and asked it to change the rule, noting that his office had received a
tip that foreign governments had also begun requesting the
push-notification data. ↫ Drew Harwell for The Washington Post Not
surprising, of course. The one nugget of good news here is that while
Apple’s policy is to hand over this data after a mere subpoena (“privacy
is a fundamental human right“, everybody), Google requires an actual
court order, meaning federal officials must convince a judge of the
validity of the request. Assuming this is not a nebulous secret backroom
deal but a proper judicial process, I’m actually okay with that – law
enforcement does need the ability to investigate potential criminals,
and as long as this happens within the boundaries of the law and
properly overseen and approved by the judiciary every step along the
way, I can support it.</p>

Gemini: Google’s largest and most capable AI model</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>This promise of a world responsibly empowered by AI continues to
drive our work at Google DeepMind. For a long time, we’ve wanted to
build a new generation of AI models, inspired by the way people
understand and interact with the world. AI that feels less like a smart
piece of software and more like something useful and intuitive — an
expert helper or assistant. Today, we’re a step closer to this vision as
we introduce Gemini, the most capable and general model we’ve ever
built. Gemini is the result of large-scale collaborative efforts by
teams across Google, including our colleagues at Google Research. It was
built from the ground up to be multimodal, which means it can generalize
and seamlessly understand, operate across and combine different types of
information including text, code, audio, image and video. ↫ Demis
Hassabis on Google’s official blog It’s no secret I’m not particularly
impressed by “AI”, not least because its ability to autocomplete
complete nonsense based on copyrighted works it’s drawing from without
permission and the dangers this might represent to our society. That
being said, Google’s new “AI” thing, as demonstrated in this video,
actually seems a tiny bit impressive. It still looks like to me like
it’s just blurting out random information using fairly mundane things
like object and speech recognition, but the fluidity of it all
definitely feels a lot more natural than whatever OpenAI and Microsoft
have shown so far. I’m still not even remotely interested in any of this
stuff, but this at least seems slightly more possibly useful than other
examples I’ve seen so far.</p>

<h2
id="discovering-relationships-between-preprints-and-journal-articles">Discovering
relationships between preprints and journal articles</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-07, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In the scholarly communications environment, the evolution of a journal
article can be traced by the relationships it has with its preprints.
Those preprint–journal article relationships are an important component
of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/">the
research nexus</a>. Some of those relationships are provided by Crossref
members (including publishers, universities, research groups, funders,
etc.) when they deposit metadata with Crossref, but we know that a
significant number of them are missing. To fill this gap, we developed a
new automated strategy for discovering relationships between preprints
and journal articles and applied it to all the preprints in the Crossref
database. We made the resulting dataset, containing both
publisher-asserted and automatically discovered relationships,
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10144856" target="_blank">publicly
available</a> for anyone to analyse.
</p>
<h2 id="tldr">
TL;DR
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
We have developed a new, heuristic-based strategy for matching journal
articles to their preprints. It achieved the following results on the
evaluation dataset: precision 0.99, recall 0.95, F0.5 0.98. The code is
available
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/marple/-/blob/main/strategies_available/preprint_sbmv/strategy.py" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We applied the strategy to all the preprints in the Crossref database.
It discovered 627K preprint–journal article relationships.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We gathered all preprint–journal article relationships deposited by
Crossref members, merged them with those discovered by the new strategy,
and made everything available as
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10144856" target="_blank">a
dataset</a>. There are 642K relationships in the dataset, including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
296K provided by the publisher and discovered by the strategy,
</li>
<li>
331K new relationships discovered by the strategy only,
</li>
<li>
15K provided by the publisher only.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the future, we plan to replace our current matching strategy with the
new one and make all discovered relationships available through the
Crossref REST API.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">
Introduction
</h2>
<p>
Relationships between preprints and journal articles link different
versions of research outputs and allow one to follow the evolution of a
publication over time. The Crossref deposit schema allows Crossref
members to provide these relationships for new publications, either as a
<em>has-preprint</em> relationship deposited with a journal article, or
an <em>is-preprint-of</em> relationship deposited with a preprint.
</p>
<p>
To assist members who deposit preprints, we also try to connect
deposited journal articles with preprints. The current method looks for
an exact match between the title and first authors. We send possible
matches as suggestions to the preprint server, which decides whether to
update the metadata with the relationship.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, 137,837 journal articles in the Crossref
database have a <em>has-preprint</em>
relationship<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>,
and 562,225 works of type posted-content (preprints belong to this type)
have an <em>is-preprint-of</em>
relationship<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
</p>
<p>
We suspected that many preprint–journal article relationships are
missing, as some members inevitably fail to deposit them, even after
suggestions from the current matching strategy. Another factor is that
the current strategy is fairly conservative, and probably misses a
significant number of relationships. For these reasons, we decided to
investigate whether we could improve on the current process. Doing so
would allow us to infer missing relationships on a large scale, similar
to how we automatically match bibliographic references to DOIs.
</p>
<p>
This preprint matching task can be defined in two directions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We start with a journal article and we want to find all its preprints.
</li>
<li>
We start with a preprint and we want to find a subsequently published
journal article.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
On the one hand, matching from journal articles to preprints would allow
us to enrich the database continually with new relationships, either
periodically or every time new content is added. Since journal articles
tend to appear in the database later than their preprints, it makes
sense for a new journal article to trigger the matching and not the
other way round. This way we can expect the potential matches to be
already in the database at the time of matching.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, matching from preprints to journal articles can be
useful in a situation where we want to add relationships in an existing
database retrospectively. In our case, the database contains many more
journal articles than preprints, so for performance reasons it is better
to start with preprints.
</p>
<p>
In both cases we are dealing with structured matching, meaning that we
match a metadata record of a work (preprint or journal article), rather
than unstructured text.
</p>
<p>
As a result of matching a single preprint or a single journal article,
we should expect zero or more matched journal articles/preprints.
Multiple matches occur when:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
there are multiple versions of the matched preprint and/or
</li>
<li>
matched works have duplicates.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The image shows the result of matching a journal article to two versions
of a preprint:

<h2 id="matching-strategy">
Matching strategy
</h2>
<p>
Our matching strategy uses the following workflow:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Gathering a short list of candidates using the Crossref REST API.
</li>
<li>
Scoring the similarity between the input item and each candidate.
</li>
<li>
A final decision about which candidates, if any, should be returned as
matches.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Gathering candidates is done using the Crossref REST API’s
<em>query.bibliographic</em> parameter. The query is a concatenation of
the title and authors’ last names of the input item. We filter the
candidates based on their type, to leave only preprints or only journal
articles, depending on the direction of the matching. In the future,
instead of getting the candidates from the REST API, we will be using a
dedicated search engine, optimised for preprint matching.
</p>
<p>
Scoring candidates is heuristic-based. Similarities between titles,
authors, and years are scored independently, and the final score is
their average. Titles are compared in a fuzzy way using the
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/rapidfuzz/" target="_blank">rapidfuzz
library</a>. Authors are compared pairwise using the ORCID ID, or
first/last names if ORCID ID is not available. The similarity score
between issued years is 1 if the article was published no earlier than
one year before the preprint and no later than three years after the
preprint, or 0 otherwise.
</p>
<p>
The final decision is made based on two parameters: minimum score and
maximum score difference, both chosen based on a validation dataset. The
following diagram depicts the results of applying these two parameters
in all possible scenarios. First, any candidate scoring below the
minimum score is rejected (grey area in the diagram). Second, the scores
of the remaining candidates are compared with the score of the top
candidate. If the score of a candidate is close enough to the score of
the top candidate, it is returned as a match (blue area).
</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/preprint-matching-scenarios.png"
alt="Preprint matching scenarios" width="70%"/>
</figure>
<br/>
<p>
This process can result in the following scenarios:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Scenario A: there is no candidate above the minimum score. This means
nothing matches sufficiently, so nothing is returned.
</li>
<li>
Scenario B: there is only one candidate above the minimum score. This
means it is the best match and we don’t have much of a choice, so it is
returned.
</li>
<li>
Scenario C: there are multiple candidates above the minimum score, and
they all have similar scores. This means they all are similarly good
matches, so all are returned.
</li>
<li>
Scenario D: there are multiple candidates above the minimum score, but
their scores differ a lot. In this case, we don’t want to return all of
them, but only those that are close to the top match. Intuitively, we
don’t want to return less-than-great matches if we have really great
ones. This is when the maximum score difference comes into play: we
return the candidates with the “score distance” to the top candidate
lower than the maximum score difference.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We evaluated this strategy on a test set sampled from the Crossref
metadata records. The test set contains 3,000 pairs (journal article,
set of corresponding preprints). Half of the journal articles have known
preprints and the other half don’t. The test set can be accessed
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/marple/-/blob/main/data/datasets/preprints-rest-api-2023-06-23.json" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
We used precision, recall, and F0.5 as evaluation metrics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Precision measures the fraction of the matched relationships that are
correct.
</li>
<li>
Recall measures the fraction of the true relationships that were
matched.
</li>
<li>
F0.5 combines precision and recall in a way that favours precision.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The strategy achieved the following results: precision 0.9921, recall
0.9474, F0.5 0.9828. The average processing time was 0.96s.
</p>
<p>
We have made this strategy (journal article -&gt; preprints) available
through the (experimental) API:
<a href="https://marple.research.crossref.org/match?task=preprint-matching&amp;strategy=preprint-sbmv&amp;input=10.1109/access.2022.3213707" target="_blank">https://marple.research.crossref.org/match?task=preprint-matching&amp;strategy=preprint-sbmv&amp;input=10.1109/access.2022.3213707</a>.
The input is the DOI of a journal article we want to match to preprints,
and the output is a list of matches found, along with the score for
each.
</p>
<p>
We have investigated other approaches to making decisions about which
candidates to return as matches (step 3 above), including using machine
learning. At present none have outperformed the heuristic approach
described above. The heuristic method is also preferred because of its
fast performance.
</p>
<h2 id="preprintjournal-article-relationship-dataset">
Preprint–journal article relationship dataset
</h2>
<p>
We applied the strategy to the entire Crossref database:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
We selected all preprints published until the end of August 2023. This
included only works with type <em>posted-content</em> and subtype
<em>preprint</em>, as reported by the REST API. There were 1,050,247 of
them.
</li>
<li>
We ran the matching strategy (preprint -&gt; journal article) on them.
This resulted in 627,011 preprint–journal article relationships.
</li>
<li>
The resulting relationships were combined with the relationships
deposited by the Crossref members. We included relationships of types
<em>has-preprint</em> or <em>is-preprint-of</em>, where both sides of
the relationship exist in our database, were published until the end of
August 2023, and are of proper types and subtypes
(type=<em>journal-article</em> for the journal article and
type=<em>posted-content</em>, subtype=<em>preprint</em> for the
preprint).
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The resulting dataset is a single CSV file with the following fields:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
preprint DOI (string)
</li>
<li>
journal article DOI (string)
</li>
<li>
whether the publisher of the journal article deposited this relationship
(boolean)
</li>
<li>
whether the publisher of the preprint deposited this relationship
(boolean)
</li>
<li>
the confidence score returned by the strategy (float, empty if the
strategy did not discover this relationship)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The dataset contains:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
641,950 relationships in total, including 580,532 preprints and 565,129
journal articles,
</li>
<li>
14,939 of them were deposited by the Crossref members, but not
discovered by the strategy,
</li>
<li>
330,826 of them were discovered by the strategy, but not provided by any
Crossref member,
</li>
<li>
296,185 of them were both deposited by a Crossref member and discovered
by the strategy.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The dataset can be downloaded
<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10144856" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-whats-next">
Conclusions and what’s next
</h2>
<p>
Overall, based on the number of existing and newly discovered
preprint–journal article relationships, it seems that employing
automated matching strategies would approximately double the number of
these relationships in the Crossref database. In the future, we would
like to match new journal articles on an ongoing basis. We also plan to
make all discovered relationships available through the REST API.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, we will be publishing the discovered relationships in
the form of datasets, and we invite anyone interested to further analyse
this data. And if you find out something interesting about preprints and
their relationships, do let us know!
