## P&B: Taylor Troesh

date: 2024-03-22, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 30th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Taylor Troesh and his blog, <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a></p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&rsquo;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Hello! I’m Taylor (mayor of <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a>).</p>
<p>I collect hobbies, build things, incite chaos, and engage in elaborate tomfoolery. I work as a developer, designer, DB architect, <a href="https://taylor.town/hire-me">and other things</a>.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&rsquo;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I created my first personal website to quickly teach myself how to make websites, because I fudged my resume and accidentally landed a job as a web developer before I was ready.</p>
<p>My website became a blog when I posted my digital notebooks online circa 2015. I maintained hundreds of markdown files on various topics and ideas, but I was too embarrassed to publish most of the actual notes, so I replaced the body of each file with “Coming soon!”. My private ideas.txt file sits at 110,427 words right now. This does not include hundreds of unfinished essays, papers, books, stories, games, gadgets, etc.</p>
<p>As I grew more specific and organized, my notes became easier to digest. In 2019, I started writing about <a href="https://taylor.town/the-speedy-media-manifesto">my opinions</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/synthetic-intelligence">my fears</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/time">my inspirations</a>, and <a href="https://taylor.town/how-do-taoists-quit-smoking">my paradoxes</a>.</p>
<p>But I didn’t start writing seriously <a href="https://taylor.town/1000-weekends">until I stopped drinking in 2022</a>. Writing was welcome respite from alcohol withdrawals. Without booze to fill my emptiness, I suddenly found myself with plenty of “boring” hours. So I kept writing. And now I can’t stop writing.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I consume absurd amounts of <a href="https://taylor.town/books">books</a>, <a href="https://blogs.hn/">small blogs</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/music">music</a>, <a href="https://taylor.town/podcasts">podcasts</a>, and other internet media.</p>
<p>From there, my inspiration ferments in a 1Mb text file called ideas.txt. When I’m not doing chores, I start from the top of ideas.txt and work my way down, making small <a href="https://taylor.town/pseudoprose">pseudoprose</a> edits along the way. An idea usually sits at the top of the list for a few months before it’s ripe enough to publish.</p>
<p>Here’s an excerpt from the top of my list on Dec 7, 2023:</p>
<p>Krampus and negative punishment</p>
<ul>
<li>holiday alignment chart</li>
<li>does negative punishment work?</li>
<li>santa claus is not a god: <a href="https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/8/1-2/article-p149_8.xml">https://brill.com/view/journals/jocc/8/1-2/article-p149_8.xml</a></li>
<li>is santa effective? <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0361476X84900031">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0361476X84900031</a> santa</li>
<li>visits rich sick children: <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6355.abstract">https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i6355.abstract</a></li>
</ul></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Countless creations die in the pursuit of Ideal Creative Environments. After hearing how much quality work Tyler Cowen completes while traveling, I taught myself how to <a href="https://taylor.town/between-time">scrounge for in-between time</a>. Through that process, I made more time for creative pursuits via <a href="https://taylor.town/extinguish-all-notifications">extinguishing notifications</a> and <a href="https://taylor.town/nowify">bespoke time-tracking software</a>.</p>
<p>Today, most of my creative process occurs on couches – just me and my laptop. When I need more real-estate, I use <a href="https://taylor.town/my-battlestation">my battlestation</a>. When my thoughts become tangled, I clean my home or play with my daughter or walk outside. When I draw, I use our makeshift art studio in the basement. And so on.</p>
<p>Everything in a home or office eventually becomes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness#Invisible_Gorilla_Test">invisible gorillas</a>. In my experience, physical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propinquity">propinquity</a> is the fastest way to modulate creativity. Unsurprisingly, surrounding myself with healthy and supportive people was a really good way to become healthy and supported.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><ul>
<li>All my writings are markdown files (with YAML frontmatter) in a GitHub repo.</li>
<li>An ugly Elixir script converts each file into HTML and compiles <a href="https://taylor.town/feed.xml">an atom feed</a>.</li>
<li>All of these files are served to the public via Cloudflare Pages.</li>
<li>Every few weeks, I copy/paste stuff into <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> for <a href="https://newsletter.taylor.town/">my email newsletter</a>.</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><ul>
<li>More doodles! I’m still working up the courage to share more of my drawings…</li>
<li>People cannot spell “Troesh” from memory, so I’m glad I chose <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a> over <a href="https://taylor.troe.sh/">taylor.troe.sh</a>. But I’ll never know if <a href="https://taylor.town/">taylor.town</a> was a better choice than <a href="https://taylor.land/">taylor.land</a>.</li>
<li>If I started over, I probably wouldn’t write my build script in Elixir – maybe Haskell or Go or JS instead?</li>
<li>I wasted a lot of time on essay ideas that were time-consuming but obviously worthless. I should’ve learned earlier to sort by <a href="https://dom.iowa.gov/resource/lean-resources/impact-difficulty-matrix-template">difficulty vs. impact</a>.</li>
<li>I’m still unsure about Instagram, X, and other socials media. I love meeting strangers via email – am I missing cool people from other corners of the web?</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&rsquo;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>It costs $0 to host my blog on GitHub and Cloudflare. I spend $30/mo on Buttondown. I once hoped that my blog would land me some sweet consulting gigs. As of 2023, total consulting revenue is $0.</p>
<p>I aim to be worth <a href="https://taylor.town/dollar-per-hour">$1/hour</a>. Advertising is spooky, so I’ve been working on books and games and services to sell instead. But it’s hard to juggle making worthwhile art while working for an employer while publishing free content.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I support <a href="https://www.patreon.com/todepond">TodePond</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hundredrabbits">Hundred Rabbits</a> via Patreon.</p>
<p>I would also love to support <a href="https://www.experimental-history.com/">Experimental History</a> and <a href="https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/">Escaping Flatland</a>, but I’m avoiding Substack for now.</p>

<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>

On March 9, Kovensky explored the secret, men-only, right-wing society called the Society for American Civic Renewal (SACR), whose well-positioned, wealthy, white leaders call for instituting white male domination and their version of Christianity in the U.S. after a &#8220;regime&#8221; change.

## US Official in Guatemala for Talks, Says Texas Migrant Law Unconstitutional

date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA

Guatemala city — U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday that a Texas law giving state authorities the power to arrest and deport migrants who have entered the country illegally is unconstitutional.


"It is our strongly held view as a matter of law that SB4 [the Texas law] ... is unconstitutional and it is our hope and confidence that the courts will strike it down with finality," Mayorkas said during a joint news conference with Guatemala President Bernardo Arevalo in the Guatemalan capital.


A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments on the Texas law Wednesday but did not rule. The law is on hold for now.


Mayorkas was in Guatemala to work on the U.S.-led regional strategy toward immigration. He described it as seeking to "build lawful, safe and orderly pathways for people to reach safety from their place of persecution and, at the same time, returning people to their countries as a consequence when they do not take advantage of those lawful pathways."


Among those safe pathways is a U.S. effort to streamline the process for those seeking U.S. asylum in the region through so-called safe mobility offices. They allow migrants to start the process where they are rather than making the dangerous and costly journey to the U.S. border.


Guatemala's safe mobility office, unlike some others like Colombia's, is only open to Guatemalans seeking U.S. protection. One of the requests made by Mayorkas' delegation was that Guatemala allow the safe mobility office to process requests for migrants from other countries, according to a Guatemalan official who requested anonymity because the issue was still under discussion.


Asked during the joint news conference if the U.S. government had asked Guatemala to sign a safe third country agreement, which Guatemala's previous president had agreed to during the Trump administration, Mayorkas did not directly answer. Such an agreement would require migrants from other countries passing through Guatemala to seek protection from the Guatemalan government rather than at the U.S. border.


Asked again in the interview with the AP, Mayorkas said that Guatemala could be a safe destination for some migrants, but that he deferred to Arevalo's administration on that.


The U.S. has sought to improve cooperation with countries along the migrant route, including Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador, but Mayorkas acknowledged that it has been more challenging in Nicaragua and Venezuela, where the U.S. has strained relations with those governments.


Arévalo explained the talks in similar terms.


"We are operating under the principle that the immigration phenomenon is a regional phenomenon and that for that reason has to have answers framed in the collaborative efforts of different countries," he said.


Mayorkas also offered words of support for the Guatemalan leader, whose election victory last year was challenged and whose party still faces prosecution from Guatemala's attorney general.


"We know that the forces of corruption continue to seek to threaten democracy and the well-being of the people of Guatemala and beyond," Mayorkas said. "The United States stands with President Arevalo and his fight for democracy against the forces of corruption and for the people of Guatemala."

## US Bolstering Philippines Amid Increasing Assertiveness by China

date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA

washington — The U.S. and Philippines will for the first time venture outside Manila’s territorial waters when they begin joint annual combat drills in April, a Philippines government spokesman said Thursday.


Colonel Michael Logico said elements of the Balikatan 2024 drills would be conducted about 22 kilometers (more than 12 nautical miles) off the west coast of Palawan, an island in the archipelago nation that faces a troubled region of the South China Sea.


Chinese ships this month blocked Philippine ships near the Second Thomas Shoal, a reef about 200 kilometers (120 miles) off Palawan that both sides claim.


“The message that we want to send is that we are serious about defending our territory and we have allies,” Logico said at a news conference, according to Philippine media.


Beijing claims most of the South China Sea as its own, putting it in conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam, all of which border the sea. An international tribunal at The Hague has rejected China's claim.


Blinken visit


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the Philippines this week to bolster relations between the two countries and underscore Washington’s commitment to Manila in the face of an increasingly assertive China.


Blinken on Tuesday cited China’s “repeated violations of international law and the rights of the Philippines: water cannons, blocking maneuvers, close shadowing, [and] other dangerous operations.”


China has been building up its military presence in the South China Sea by building on reefs, including the disputed Scarborough Shoal, which it effectively seized from the Philippines in 2012.


Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s government has defiantly sought to assert sovereignty over disputed areas by supplying troops and escorting fishing boats. He told Bloomberg TV on Tuesday that he was not trying to start a conflict but “since the threat has grown, we must do more to defend our territory.”


The Philippines announced last week that it would build a new port with U.S. funding on its northern Batanes Islands, 200 kilometers (about 124 miles) from Taiwan.


While the port is expected to be for civilian use, analysts say it could also be used for military purposes and play an important role in defense — and not only for the Philippines.


Carl Thayer, an emeritus professor of politics at Australia’s University of New South Wales School of Humanities and Social Sciences, emailed VOA: "U.S. and Filipino forces in the northern Philippines would be able to monitor and strike Chinese forces in the event a conflict over Taiwan broke out."


Beijing considers Taiwan a breakaway province that must one day reunite with mainland China, by force if necessary, while the U.S. has vowed to defend Taiwan’s right to self-rule.


But the U.S. mainland is separated from the Taiwan Strait by about 11,000 kilometers (6,000 nautical miles), while mainland China is roughly 160 kilometers (100 miles) from the democratic island.


'Positive impact' for Taiwan


Although the U.S. has military bases that are closer to Taiwan in Hawaii, about 8,150 kilometers (4,400 nautical miles); Guam, about 2,780 kilometers (1,500 nautical miles); and Okinawa, about 740 kilometers (400 nautical miles), analysts say the closer its military assets are to Taiwan, the faster they can respond and resupply in the event of a Chinese attack.


"While the Philippines may not change the situation in the Taiwan Strait, the greater interest in the Philippines by Washington and Tokyo will have a positive impact on Taiwan's security,” said Thomas J. Shattuck, the senior program manager at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perry World House, in an email to VOA.


“It will increase U.S. assets in Taiwan's south," Shattuck said. "It will make it harder for China to dominate in the 'southern theater' of a possible Taiwan conflict. But again, there is more work to be done in this regard."


Marcos last year said the U.S. military would be allowed to use four new military bases in the Philippines, in addition to five where they are already allowed, for training, building infrastructure and pre-positioning supplies, though the access would not be permanent.


Although many countries in the Indo-Pacific region receive U.S. military assistance, the Philippines receives the most.  From 2015 to 2022, Manila received more than $1.14 billion worth of aircraft, armored vehicles, small arms, equipment and training, $475 million of it in aid.


Blinken's trip to the Philippines marks the second time a senior U.S. Cabinet official has visited the nation this month. On March 11, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced fresh investments from U.S. firms of more than $1 billion in the archipelago nation.


Despite China’s more assertive moves in the South China Sea, the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Gregory Poling argues Beijing has lost momentum. Poling, who is senior fellow and director of CSIS’s Southeast Asia Program and Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, notes that since 2022, Southeast Asian nations such as the Philippines have stopped giving ground to China.


At the same time, he writes in Eurasia Review, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have resumed development of infrastructure and oil and gas fields in the disputed region, despite China's objections.


China’s provocative moves are one of the main topics expected to be on the agenda in April when President Joe Biden hosts a historic summit with Marcos and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

## Creature Named for Kermit the Frog Offers Clues on Amphibian Evolution

date: 2024-03-22, from: VOA News USA

washington  — There definitely were no Muppets during the Permian Period, but there was a Kermit — or at least a forerunner of modern amphibians that has been named after the celebrity frog.


Scientists on Thursday described the fossilized skull of a creature called Kermitops gratus that lived in what is now Texas about 270 million years ago. It belongs to a lineage believed to have given rise to the three living branches of amphibians — frogs, salamanders and limbless caecilians.


While only the skull, measuring around 3 cm long, was discovered, the researchers think Kermitops had a stoutly built salamander-like body roughly 15-18 cm long, though salamanders would not evolve for another roughly 100 million years.


Amphibians are one of the four groups of living terrestrial vertebrates, along with reptiles, birds and mammals. The unique features of the Kermitops skull — a blend of archaic and more advanced features — are providing insight into amphibian evolution.


"Kermitops helps us understand the early history of amphibians by revealing there isn't a clear trend of step by step becoming more like the modern amphibian," said Calvin So, a George Washington University paleontology doctoral student and lead author of the study published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.


The fossil was collected in 1984 near Lake Kemp in Texas and kept in the expansive collection of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington but was not thoroughly studied until recently.


Kermitops had a rounded snout, not unlike frogs and salamanders. Preserved in its eye sockets were palpebral bones, or eyelid bones, a feature absent in today's amphibians. Its skull is constructed of roof-like bones, in contrast to the thin and strut-like bones of modern amphibians.


"The length of the skull in front of the eyes is longer than the length of the skull behind the eyes, which differs from the other fossil amphibians living at the same time. We think this might have allowed Kermitops to snap its jaws closed faster, enabling capture of fast insect prey," So said.


The fossil record of early amphibians and their forerunners is spotty, making it difficult to figure out the origins of modern amphibians.


"Kermitops, with its unique anatomy, really exemplifies the importance of continuing to add new fossil data to understanding this evolutionary problem," said National Museum of Natural History paleontologist and study co-author Arjan Mann.


Kermit the Frog was created by the late American puppeteer Jim Henson in 1955, and a Kermit puppet made in the 1970s is in the collection of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History as an important cultural object.


Kermitops means "Kermit face," a nod to the Muppet's humorous look.


"We thought that the eyelid bones gave the fossil a bug-eyed look, and combined with a lopsided smile produced by slight crushing during the preservation of the fossil, we really thought it looked like Kermit the Frog," So said.


Kermitops belonged to a group called temnospondyls that arose a few tens of millions of years after the first land vertebrates evolved from fish ancestors. The biggest temnospondyls superficially resembled crocodiles, including two that each were around 6 meters in length, Prionosuchus and Mastodonsaurus.


Temnospondyls are considered the progenitor lineage of modern amphibians, Mann said.


Kermitops existed about 20 million years before the worst mass extinction in Earth's history and about 40 million years before the first dinosaurs. It lived alongside other members of the amphibian lineage as well as the impressive sail-backed Dimetrodon, a predator related to the mammalian lineage.


The environment in which Kermitops lived appears to have alternated between warm and humid seasons and hot and arid seasons.


"This environment would be similar to modern-day monsoons that take place in the Southwest U.S. and Southeast Asia," So said.

## US Regulators Urge Congress to Look Into Grocery Profits

date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA

New York  — The U.S. Federal Trade Commission recommended Thursday that policymakers look further into profits at grocery stores that remain elevated since the pandemic and promotions that consumer products makers offer retailers.


The FTC also is suing to block Kroger's acquisition of smaller grocery store rival Albertsons, citing concerns the deal would hike prices for millions of Americans.


The FTC launched the study in 2021 when it ordered Walmart, Kroger, Procter & Gamble, grocery wholesalers and others to turn over detailed information relating to the supply chain crisis during the pandemic, which contributed to double-digit price increases on household necessities.


Big box and chain stores secured limited resources, leaving small independent grocers at a disadvantage, FTC Chairperson Lina Khan said on a public call to discuss the report. This harmed communities reliant on these smaller retailers and could have also strengthened market dominance of larger corporations, she added.


"If we end up finding that these types of practices violated any of the antitrust laws including the [Robinson-] Patman act, I'll be very interested in making sure we take swift action," she said without providing details.


The Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 is a U.S. antitrust law preventing large franchises and chains from engaging in price discrimination against small businesses.


Several representatives of smaller grocery operators spoke on the call saying that during the pandemic, they faced shortages of toilet paper, cleaning products and pet supplies as manufacturers prioritized their biggest clients.


"It was a true test of survival for a lot of our customers," said Brian Patterson, head buyer at Piggly Wiggly Alabama Distributing Co.


Walmart and Kroger are among chains that have touted gaining U.S. grocery market share. Kroger's most recent quarterly statements said it improved volume share consistently for the past five quarters. Walmart said it gained market share in "virtually every category," citing its lower prices.


Walmart and Kroger did grow share from 2018 to 2022, but only modestly, according to Coresight Research data.


The FTC said it will pass the report onto lawmakers, "where there has been broad interest" from members of both parties.


U.S. President Joe Biden has taken aim at grocery chains this year.


"Today’s FTC report shows grocery retailers increased profits during the pandemic and have maintained or increased those margins even as their own costs have come down," the White House said in an email to Reuters on Thursday.


In Thursday's report, the FTC found that a measure of annual profits for food and beverage retailers "rose substantially and remains quite elevated." The commission said revenues for grocery retailers were 6% over total costs in 2021, and 7% in the first nine months of 2023, higher than a peak of 5.6% in 2015.


"This casts doubt on assertions that rising prices at the grocery store are simply moving in lockstep with retailers’ own rising costs," the FTC said, adding that elevated profit levels "warrant further inquiry" by both policymakers and the commission, which is tasked with protecting the public from unfair business practices.


The FTC also said trade promotions, payments by consumer goods companies to retailers for favorable product placement in stores and on e-commerce websites, "may warrant further study."


The reduction in spending harmed traditional grocers that use a "high-low" pricing strategy with more frequent promotions, the FTC found.


Retailers that offer "everyday low pricing" with fewer promotions, like Walmart, benefited, according to the study.


Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

## FAFSA Delays Prompt California to Extend Deadline for Financial Aid Applications

date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA

Sacramento, California — The California Legislature on Thursday voted to give prospective college students more time to apply for two of the state's largest financial aid programs after a glitch in the federal government's application system threatened to block up to 100,000 people from getting help.


California had already extended the deadline for its financial aid programs from March 2 to April 2. On Thursday, the state Senate gave final approval to a bill that would extend it again until May 2. The bill now heads to Governor Gavin Newsom.


"Clearly, our students need our help," Assemblymember Sabrina Cervantes, a Democrat from Riverside who authored the bill, told lawmakers during a public hearing earlier this week.


California has multiple programs to help people pay for college. The biggest is the Cal Grant program, which gives money to people who meet certain income requirements. The state also has a Middle Class Scholarship for people with slightly higher incomes.


Students can apply for these state aid programs only if they first complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, commonly known as FAFSA.


This year, a computer glitch prevented parents from filling out the form if they did not have a Social Security number. That meant many students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents but whose parents are not were blocked from completing the form and thus could not apply for California's aid programs.


California has a large population of adults who are living in the country without legal permission. The California Student Aid Commission, the state agency in charge of California's financial aid programs, estimates as many as 100,000 students could be affected by this glitch.


The U.S. Department of Education says it fixed the problem last week, but those families are now a step behind. Democrats in Congress raised alarms last month, noting that the delay could particularly hurt students in states where financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, including Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Oregon and Texas.


Advocates fear that the chaos of this year's process could deter students from going to college at all, especially those for whom finances are a key part of the decision.


The computer glitch is just one part of larger problems affecting FAFSA.


The notoriously time-consuming form was overhauled in 2020 through a bipartisan bill in Congress. It promised to simplify the form, going from 100 questions to fewer than 40, and it also changed the underlying formula for student aid, promising to expand it to more low-income students.


But the update has been marred by delays, leaving families across the country in limbo as they figure out how much college will cost.


The form is typically available to fill out in October, but the Education Department didn't have it ready until late December. Even then, the agency wasn't ready to begin processing the forms and sending them to states and colleges, which only started to happen this month.


The problems appear to have already reduced California's application numbers. Through March 8, the number of California students who had completed FAFSA was 43% lower than it was at the same time last year.


"The data most concerning me seems to suggest that these drops are more acute at the schools that serve low-income students or large populations of students of color," Jake Brymner, deputy chief of policy and public affairs for the California Student Aid Commission, told lawmakers in a public hearing earlier this week.


The issue has caused problems for colleges and universities, too. The University of California and California State University systems both delayed their admissions deadlines because so many prospective students were having trouble with FAFSA.

Perhaps none is more concerning than Trump’s potential return to the White House with <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self">the Project 2025 playbook</a> in hand.

When I spoke to environmental lawyers at the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, though, they stressed that the EPA’s regulations make it difficult for an unfriendly executive branch to shake them off. </p><p>If a future administration were to want to change the rules finalized this week, it would have to go through “a full rulemaking process,” Peter Zalzal, a member of EDF’s Domestic Climate and Air legal team, told me. That would include “a proposal that laid out the agency’s rationale for making those choices, and the facts supporting that rationale, and then hold a public comment process to incorporate stakeholder feedback.” Only after going through all that would it be able to take decisive action.</p><p>While it is possible that a Trump administration would attempt this, a senior advisor to the NRDC action fund who spoke to me on the condition of anonymity given the political nature of the question, stressed that groups like theirs would fight tooth and nail to halt such a rollback.

Additionally, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group is planning a seven-figure ad spend across seven states “against the new rules heading into the 2024 election,” <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/epa-announces-tighter-tailpipe-emissions-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Kelley Blue Book</em> reports</a>, including an effort to brand them as a “gas car ban.” </p><p>The rules are definitively not a ban, and automakers are generally <a href="https://uaw.org/uaw-statement-on-the-epas-new-greenhouse-gas-emissions-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on board with them</a>. “It’s just not a case that these standards require any kind of particular technologies,” Zalzal, from EDF, told me. “In fact, we’ve done modeling to show that manufacturers could meet these by selling very few battery electric vehicles.” (He added that, to be clear, that isn’t the expectation). Generally, experts seem to agree that the rules are on solid legal footing.</p><p>Still, it’s better to be safe than sorry. As my colleague Matthew Zeitlin has reported, California has quietly been working behind the scenes to get automakers to voluntarily comply with the regulations — and, in that way, <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/california-stellantis-trump-epa" target="_self">sneakily “Trump-proof” the electrification push</a>. </p><p>After all, that’s the one thing you can count on with elephants: You can see them coming. </p>

## At UN, Nations Cooperate Toward Safe, Trustworthy AI Systems

date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA

United Nations — The U.N. General Assembly adopted by consensus Thursday a first-of-its-kind resolution addressing the potential of artificial intelligence to accelerate progress toward sustainable development, while emphasizing the need for safe, secure and trustworthy AI systems.


The initiative, led by the United States, seeks to manage AI’s risks while utilizing its benefits.


“Today as the U.N. and AI finally intersect, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to choose as one united global community to govern this technology rather than to let it govern us,” said U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. “So let us reaffirm that AI will be created and deployed through the lens of humanity and dignity, safety and security, human rights and fundamental freedoms.”


The Biden administration said it took more than three months to negotiate what it characterized as a “baseline set of principles” around AI, engaging with 120 countries and incorporating feedback from many of them, including China, which was one of the 123 co-sponsors of the text.


While General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, they reflect the political consensus of the international community.


The resolution recognizes the disparities in technological development between developed and developing countries and stresses the need to bridge the digital divide so everyone can equitably access the benefits of AI.


It also outlines measures for responsible AI governance, including the development of regulatory frameworks, capacity building initiatives and support for research and innovation. The resolution encourages international collaboration to address the evolving challenges and opportunities AI technologies pose, with a focus on advancing sustainable development goals.


U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed adoption of the resolution, saying all nations must be guided by a common set of understandings on the use of AI systems.


“Too often, in past technological revolutions, the benefits have not been shared equitably, and the harms have been felt by a disproportionate few,” she said in a statement. “This resolution establishes a path forward on AI where every country can both seize the promise and manage the risks of AI.”


At the World Economic Forum meetings in Davos, Switzerland, in January, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern about the risk of unintended consequences with “every new iteration of generative AI.” He said it has “enormous potential” for sustainable development but also the potential to worsen inequality.


“And some powerful tech companies are already pursuing profits with a clear disregard for human rights, personal privacy and social impact,” he said at the time.


The U.N. chief created an AI advisory body last year, and it will publish its final report ahead of the U.N.’s Summit of the Future in September.

Paris — Representatives of 30 nations meeting in Brussels vowed to beef up nuclear energy Thursday as one solution to meet climate-fighting targets and guarantee reliable energy supplies. But the issue of nuclear power is divisive, and critics say it shouldn’t be part of the world’s approach to energy challenges.


The summit was the first of its kind, drawing leaders and delegates from the United States, Brazil, China and France, among others. The International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, co-hosted the meeting and is promoting nuclear energy as a key way to reduce skyrocketing climate emissions.


IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said, “The heads of government, presidents, they believe that in the current context energywise, securitywise, nuclear has a very important contribution to make.”




Over 400 nuclear plants operate in about 30 countries, with another 500 planned or under construction. But overall, nuclear represents 10% of global electricity generation. In a statement, countries attending the meeting committed to increasing nuclear power's potential, including by building new plants.


White House climate advisor John Podesta said, “I think what this summit will do, will put a marker down ... that expansion of nuclear power is critical for tackling the climate crisis that is really beginning to disturb everyone across the globe.”


European Union countries such as France, which gets about 70% of its electricity from nuclear power, believe it can help meet ambitious European climate goals.


But the EU itself is divided. Some member states, including Germany, Austria and Spain, have safety and environmental concerns about nuclear energy, including the waste it generates.


So do groups such as Greenpeace, whose activists protested the Brussels summit.


Lorelei Limousin, the climate and energy campaigner for Greenpeace EU in Brussels, said, “Nuclear power is too slow to tackle the climate emergency. Nuclear energy is also very expensive, and much more expensive than renewables today. Finally nuclear power remains dangerous today — with risks to health, environment, safety.”


Supporters say those risks can be managed — and they say that for now, increasing nuclear's share of the power mix is essential if the world is to turn around a dangerous climate trajectory.

## The First Open Ocean Carbon Removal Project in the U.S. Just Got a Green Light

date: 2024-03-21, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc2Mjg3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNDEyNzQwNX0.w88G-VYAJ8_xZcjyJOHQJ9kCHjYE0VaFpJy3sWMp_CU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">When visitors flock to the beach this summer in Duck, North Carolina, a small, 6-mile long town on the Outer Banks, they may catch a glimpse of a climate experiment happening among the waves.</p><p>About 1,500 feet offshore, a company called Vesta will be pouring 9,000 tons of sand into the sea and watching carefully to see what happens next. This finely crushed rock will not be of the typical Outer Banks variety. Instead, it will consist of a mineral called olivine, which should enhance the ocean’s ability to absorb carbon from the atmosphere — and lock it away for thousands of years.</p><p>That the experiment can go ahead at all marks a milestone for ocean-based carbon removal, a category of climate solutions that prod the ocean into sucking up more CO2. A big obstacle for the field has been the lack of a legal framework for permitting real-world trials — U.S. laws governing the ocean weren’t written with the prospect of intentionally altering its chemistry to address an existential environmental crisis in mind. But after an 18-month interagency review process, Vesta is now the first company with a federal permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to deploy a stand-alone carbon removal test in U.S. waters.</p><p>Though 9,000 tons may sound like a lot, this is still a relatively small-scale pilot designed to assess how effective the olivine is in driving carbon removal, as well as observe any other changes in the environment and develop methods for tracking the movement of the sand in the water. These kinds of field trials are essential to establishing which marine carbon removal methods have potential and which don’t. </p><p>“We want to measure everything very carefully at this stage and make sure that we are fully understanding the safety profile and the carbon removal data from this project,” Tom Green, Vesta’s CEO, told me. But the company has big aspirations. If things go well, he said, maybe olivine could be used for beach nourishment projects all over the country, where sand is deposited along the shore to address erosion. “Imagine the carbon removal possibilities if we did that with olivine sand,” he said. “We could quickly become the largest technique for permanent carbon removal that's out there.”</p><p>Scientists generally agree that stopping global warming this century will require both reducing emissions and taking carbon out of the atmosphere. The sheer size of the ocean and its natural ability to store vast amounts of carbon make it an enticing place to look for solutions.</p><p>Dumping thousands of tons of non-native sand into the ocean may not sound like the most convincing option — especially since the ocean is already “experiencing unprecedented destabilizing changes through massive warming, acidification, deoxygenation, and a host of resulting effects,” according to an <a href="https://www.oceancdrscience.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open letter</a> published last year and signed by hundreds of scientists. However, despite this — or perhaps because of it — the letter called for accelerating research to find out whether any of the proposed ocean-based carbon removal methods, including releasing large quantities of ground olivine, are viable.</p><p>Olivine is an abundant mineral with special properties. When it comes into contact with seawater, it drives a chemical reaction that converts CO2 gas into more stable forms of carbon that can’t readily return to the atmosphere. This in turn creates a deficit of CO2 in the surface waters, which triggers the ocean to take up more from the atmosphere in order to maintain equilibrium. </p><p>Reactions like this are happening constantly in the ocean already, but on very slow timescales. Vesta’s innovation is to speed up the process by crushing and deploying olivine strategically where the wind and waves can most efficiently weather it away.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The site of an earlier Vesta test project in the Hamptons.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of Vesta</small></p><p>Olivine could address the harms of CO2 pollution in more ways than one. The ocean already absorbs about 30% of the carbon released into the atmosphere each year, which has made the water more acidic and less hospitable to many of its inhabitants. But when olivine triggers these reactions, it can act as a sort of antacid. This approach to carbon removal is also known as <a href="https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/climate-weather/ocean-based-climate-solutions/ocean-alkalinity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enhancing the ocean’s alkalinity</a> and olivine is just one of a number of different ways to do it. Another company called Planetary is experimenting with adding a different mineral, magnesium hydroxide, to the ocean. Ebb Carbon, on the other hand, is sucking up seawater and running it through a membrane to increase its alkalinity, before returning it to the tides.</p><p>Both already have field trials up and running, but instead of trying to conduct stand-alone experiments in the open ocean they’ve hitched onto existing ocean dumping permits. Ebb, for example, has set up at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s facility in Sequim, Washington, where it is releasing treated seawater into wastewater that flows into the bay. Similarly, Planetary is conducting pilot projects at the wastewater outflows of a water treatment facility and power plant in Canada. Other ocean carbon removal companies, such as Los Angeles-based Captura, have opted to <a href="https://capturacorp.com/equinor-and-captura-partner-to-develop-ocean-carbon-removal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">move abroad for their early projects</a> and avoid the U.S. permitting puzzle altogether.</p><p>Vesta went to Duck because it is among the most studied stretches of coastline in the country. The town is home to an Army Corps coastal field research center known for its long-term data set on the surrounding waters. “Few locations on the globe provide a better archive of wave, water, bathymetry and other forces that shape nearshore conditions,” <a href="https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/476710/field-research-facility/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Army Corps’ website</a>. (“Bathymetry” is the topography of the seafloor.) That means Vesta will be able to get a more accurate picture of any changes the olivine is responsible for. </p><p>When Drew Havens, the town manager in Duck, first heard about Vesta’s plans, he was skeptical. “You're dumping something into the ocean, people automatically go to, well, is it going to harm humans? Is it going to be harmful to wildlife or other living organisms?” he told me.</p><p>Though some in the town are still nervous, Havens said he has become more comfortable with the idea as the project has been rigorously reviewed by environmental protection regulators at the federal and state level. Vesta’s scientists also engaged with the town council, did an open house for members of the public, and have generally invited questions and open dialogue. </p><p>Just because regulators have determined that the risks of this pilot project are low, however, doesn’t mean using olivine for carbon removal is risk-free. For one, the rock has to be mined — in this case, from a quarry in Norway, although it is also found in the U.S. — and transported to the project site. That’s likely to produce some environmental impacts, though the company <a href="https://www.vesta.earth/duck" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a> that the project will ultimately remove about 10 times more CO2 from the atmosphere than the emissions associated with running the experiment, including the mining and shipping of olivine. </p><p>But the biggest risk with mined olivine is that it <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contains nickel</a>, said Jaime Palter, an associate professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island who has no affiliation with Vesta. Nickel can act as both a nutrient and a toxin for phytoplankton, she told me, so it's important to study whether putting olivine in the ocean will result in adverse effects. </p><p>Vesta has been closely examining that possibility. In fact, the project in Duck will be the company’s second U.S. field trial. In the summer of 2022, Vesta got permission from the town of Southampton in Long Island to spread olivine on the beach as part of a larger sand replenishment project that was already in the works. Vesta’s scientists worked with local academic partners at Cornell, SUNY Stony Brook, and Hamilton College to do extensive monitoring both before and after the sand was placed, collecting data on more than 20 indicators of the effects on the water, sediment, and ecology.</p><p>The company has since published two annual reports on the project. It is still awaiting analysis of many of the samples, but so far, the results have been promising, Green said. There has been no sign of trace metal accumulation in Eastern Oysters, a species known to accumulate pollutants from their environment, for instance. There was also no significant difference in water quality between control areas and the sites with olivine, and trace metal concentrations were below the relevant <a href="https://www.epa.gov/wqc/national-recommended-water-quality-criteria-aquatic-life-criteria-table" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EPA water quality guidelines</a>. The area’s benthic macrofauna — critters like clams and small crustaceans that live on or near the seafloor — were as abundant and various as before. </p><p>Notably, the tests also showed evidence of an increase in alkalinity in the waters of the olivine-treated area, which is the key reaction that leads to carbon removal. But Green said there’s more work to be done in terms of calculating where and when removal may have happened.</p><p>There’s also more work to be done to understand the effects of olivine in different environments, which brings us back to Duck. There, it will be deposited in 25-foot deep water instead of on the beach, helping Vesta to further refine its data and measurement methods. The plan is to continue testing and collecting data at the site for at least two years. The company declined to comment on the budget for the project. Vesta is funded primarily by venture capital investors but also raises money for research through an affiliated nonprofit.</p><p>Vesta may have been the first to get a federal permit to run a marine carbon removal test, but it definitely won’t be the last. Nikhil Neelakantan, a senior project manager at Ocean Visions, which is a nonprofit that advocates for ocean-based climate solutions, told me there are a number of other domestic projects in the pipeline, including <a href="https://oceanacidification.noaa.gov/fy23-nopp-mcdr-awards/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more than a dozen government-funded research projects</a>. The White House also recently set up a marine carbon removal <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/mCDR_FTAC_charter_2023_09_19_approved.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fast track action committee</a> with the mandate to create recommendations for policy, permitting, and regulatory standards for both research and implementation.</p><p>Neelakantan said there is work to do on clarifying the role of different agencies in regulating ocean carbon removal, and which laws apply to each method.</p><p>“This is an early first step, and it's exciting to see that it's finally going to come to fruition,” he said, of Vesta’s project in Duck. “I think there's momentum with this federal task force. It's going to be the first of many others that will happen soon.”</p>

## United States files antitrust lawsuit against Apple

date: 2024-03-21, from: OS News

For many years, Apple has built a dominant iPhone platform and ecosystem that has driven the company’s astronomical valuation. At the same time, it has long understood that disruptive technologies and innovative apps, products, and services threatened that dominance by making users less reliant on the iPhone or making it easier to switch to a non-Apple smartphone. Rather than respond to competitive threats by offering lower smartphone prices to consumers or better monetization for developers, Apple would meet competitive threats by imposing a series of shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines and developer agreements that would allow Apple to extract higher fees, thwart innovation, offer a less secure or degraded user experience, and throttle competitive alternatives. It has deployed this playbook across many technologies, products, and services, including super apps, text messaging, smartwatches, and digital wallets, among many others. Apple’s conduct also stifles new paradigms that threaten Apple’s smartphone dominance, including the cloud, which could make it easier for users to enjoy high-end functionality on a lower priced smartphone—or make users device-agnostic altogether. As one Apple manager recently observed, “Imagine buying a  Android for 25 bux at a garage sale and it works fine … And you have a solid cloud computing device. Imagine how many cases like that there are.” Simply put, Apple feared the disintermediation of its iPhone platform and undertook a course of conduct that locked in users and developers while protecting its profits. Critically, Apple’s anticompetitive conduct not only limits competition in the smartphone market, but also reverberates through the industries that are affected by these restrictions, including financial services, fitness, gaming, social media, news media, entertainment, and more. Unless Apple’s anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct is stopped, it will likely extend and entrench its iPhone monopoly to other markets and parts of the economy. For example, Apple is rapidly expanding its influence and growing its power in the automotive, content creation and entertainment, and financial services industries–and often by doing so in exclusionary ways that further reinforce and deepen the competitive moat around the iPhone. ↫ DoJ antitrust lawsuit vs. Apple The United States Department of Justice is filing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple.

## Why I don’t write dev posts

date: 2024-03-21, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>There are some 400 or so blog posts on this site. I could be wrong but I think I wrote precisely 1 dev focused post. I wrote a few blog posts here and there that are tangentially work-related because they’re about projects I worked on but that’s about it.</p>
<p>There’s a reason why I don’t write about dev stuff. And it’s not because I find it boring or uninspiring. Quite the contrary. I love learning about web stuff. I love reading Robin’s <a href="https://robinrendle.com/the-cascade/">The Cascade</a> for example. There’s always something new happening on the web, especially in the frontend space. And as a—former?—designer I love learning about front-end stuff.</p>
<p>The reason why I don’t write about dev stuff it’s because, like many others, I suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>. I’ve been working on the web for more than 12 years. I’m still convinced I don’t know shit. I scroll through <a href="https://minimal.gallery/">minimal.gallery</a> or <a href="https://onepagelove.com/">OPL</a>, see the work of all those great designers and developers, and reinforce this idea that there are, in fact, countless people out there who are better than me.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, the rational part of me knows that’s not entirely true. Of course there are people that are better than me. There will always be people better than me at literally everything. Still, this sensation of not knowing shit keeps following me around and it’s the reason why I don’t write about web stuff. This is also the reason why I said no when I was offered the possibility to teach. I know, it’s probably stupid but it is what it is. Dealing with my mind is a tough job.</p>                <hr>

## US Takes On Apple in Antitrust Lawsuit

date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday sued Apple, the first major antitrust effort against the iPhone maker by the Biden administration, alleging it monopolized smartphone markets.  


Apple joins a list of major tech companies sued by U.S. regulators, including Alphabet's  Google, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com across the administrations of both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.


"Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. "If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly."


The Justice Department alleges that Apple uses its market power to get more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants.


The civil lawsuit accuses Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access from, developers.


Apple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea, as well as lawsuits from corporate rivals such as Epic Games.  


One of Apple's most lucrative businesses - its App Store, which charges developers commissions of up to 30% - has already survived a lengthy legal challenge under U.S. law by Epic. While the lawsuit found that Apple did not violate antitrust laws, a federal judge ordered Apple to allow links and buttons to pay for apps without using Apple's in-app payment commission.


In Europe, Apple's App Store business model has been dismantled by a new law called the Digital Markets Act that went into effect earlier this month. Apple plans to let developers offer their own app stores - and, importantly, pay no commissions - but rivals such as Spotify and Epic argue Apple is still making it too hard to offer alternative app stores.


The rulings on Apple's App Store forced the Justice Department to look at Apple's other practices for the basis of a complaint, such as how Apple allows outside firms to access the chips and sensors in the iPhone.


Consumer hardware firms, such as smart-tracker maker Tile Inc, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.  


Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.


Similarly, Apple has restricted access to a chip in the iPhone that allows for contactless payments. Credit cards can only be added to the iPhone by using Apple's own Apple Pay service.  


And Apple has also faced criticism over its iMessage service, which only works on Apple devices.


Apple has long argued that it restricts access to some user data and some of the iPhone's hardware by third-party developers for privacy and security reasons.

## A plant that’s everywhere is fueling a growing risk of wildfire disaster

date: 2024-03-21, from: San Jose Mercury News

The West is most at risk, where more than two-thirds of the homes burned over the last 30 years were located. Of those, nearly 80% were burned in grass and shrub fires.

## To Understand the EPA’s Car Rules, Look to China

date: 2024-03-21, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc4NzA5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzY2NDUzOX0.VMothbfMd5JtygJoFBWtei66rAWZ9TG9IZPza7nZTys/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">On Wednesday, the Biden administration finalized sweeping new rules that will sharply limit how much carbon pollution new cars and trucks can emit into the atmosphere. The rules — which rank as one of Biden’s most important climate moves — are aimed at accelerating the country’s transition to electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, requiring most new cars sold in 2032 to burn little gasoline or none at all. </p>
<p>My colleague Emily Pontecorvo has an <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_self">excellent explainer</a> on how the new rules work. But I want to focus on one more aspect: Why they are able to do so much more than previous tailpipe regulations. </p>
<p>The new rules are not the Environmental Protection Agency’s first foray into regulating climate-warming pollution from vehicle tailpipes. Since 2010, the EPA has periodically tightened new limits on the amount of climate-warming pollution that cars and light-duty trucks can emit. The new rules are in some ways merely the next evolution of that approach. </p>
<p>But they also go much further than the agency ever has before. Where previous regulations essentially required automakers only to sell some conventional hybrids and electric vehicles, by the beginning of next decade, the lion’s share of cars sold in the United States must be electric vehicles or hybrids, the EPA now says.</p>
<p>Why is that ambition possible? One reason is that the United States has a more aggressive climate law on the books now than it has had during past rulemakings. Biden’s climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, will subsidize the purchase, leasing, and manufacturing of electric vehicles. Because of how the EPA calculates the costs and benefits of its proposals, these subsidies will significantly cut the projected cost of even an ambitious rule — in this case by as much as $65 billion. (The agency calculates that consumers will save even more money — up to a staggering $230 billion — by paying less gasoline tax because they will be buying less fuel.)</p>
<p>Yet the IRA is not the only reason — or even the <em>main</em> reason — these rules can go so much further than what was previously imagined. If the United States can pursue such an ambitious standard now, that’s because it’s following on the heels of electric vehicle policy passed in other jurisdictions: <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">China</a>, <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/california-stellantis-trump-epa" target="_self">California</a>, and the European Union. These state and national policies have set the pace for the EV transition around the world, setting new market expectations or significantly cutting the costs of building an electric car. </p>
<p>They also created a sense of inevitability around electric vehicles. “The future is electric. Automakers are committed to the EV transition,” John Bozella, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a car-industry trade group in Washington, <a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/posts/press-release/epa-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-criteria-pollutant-rules-statement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> in a statement Wednesday on the EPA rules. </p>
<p>Corey Cantor, an analyst at the market research firm BNEF, summed it all up. “What is different this time — compared to say, where the world was in 2016 — is that there is now a thriving global EV market, versus a nascent one,” he said. There are also a handful of global companies poised to profit from a global EV transition, regardless of what Ford, Toyota, General Motors, and other legacy auto brands do.</p>
<p>Even before Biden asked the EPA to issue new regulations, in other words, these policies had changed the metaphorical game board — and changed how far the agency could push the rules.</p>
<p>These global policies don’t all take the same form. <a href="https://rmi.org/understanding-californias-advanced-clean-cars-ii-regulation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">California</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-countries-poised-approve-2035-phaseout-co2-emitting-cars-2023-03-28/#:~:text=The%20EU%20law%20will%20require,new%20car%20fleets%20in%20Europe." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the European Union</a> already require that all new cars sold in 2035 must be electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids, although the EU has carved out an exception for a theoretical <a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/f1-saudi-aramco-sportswashing-report" target="_self">zero-carbon gasoline replacement</a>. </p>
<p>Due to a longstanding provision in the Clean Air Act, other U.S. states can opt into California’s stricter air pollution laws. So far, 14 in total — making up more than 40% of America’s light-duty car market — <a href="https://www.c2es.org/document/us-state-clean-vehicle-policies-and-incentives/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have adopted</a> California’s 2035 zero-emissions vehicle mandate.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/china-aims-for-evs-to-account-for-50-of-all-car-sales-by-2035-60954964" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">China</a>, meanwhile, has not set a requirement that all cars must plug in by a certain year. Instead, it will require that “new energy vehicles” — a category that can include EVs and plug-in hybrids, but also conventional hybrids — must make up half of all car sales by 2035. But Chinese companies have raced ahead of this target. Wang Chuanfu, the CEO of the massive Chinese automaker BYD, <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/03/19/byd-nev-share-50-next-3-months-china/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimated</a> this weekend that 50% of China’s car sales could be new energy vehicles as soon as June.</p>
<p>All together, these mandates added up to a strong market signal. By last year, more than half of the global auto market was already covered by some form of clean vehicle rule — even before the EPA did anything final. Now, if the new EPA rules are enforced as written, then more than 60% of the world’s car market will be subject to some kind of emissions mandate. </p>
<p>This reflects, at least in part, a recognition that the global car market is changing beyond the ability of Washington politicians to influence it. “If we’re talking 10 years from now, policy probably won’t be needed, at least in leading markets. EVs will have just naturally taken over the market,” <a href="https://theicct.org/team-member/stephanie-searle/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stephanie Searle</a>, who leads research programs at the International Council on Clean Transportation, told me.</p>
<p>Over the past year, a parade of cheap new EVs from Chinese automakers — including <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/663595/byd-seagull-ev-priced-11400-usd-gets-10000-orders-first-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the BYD Seagull</a>, a sub-$10,000 hatchback that gets up to 251 miles of range — have stunned the automotive industry. Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, told investors last month that the company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-ceo-worrying-china-ev-210427890.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGOJfCq_b1u1o08P6QZ5YcCGmyejoRmynHI6aCv7gUBUnpzXAR9MpKfxsF6OrWhaE-sAQR3bDBHZqucJa2LeHI0w83iBU8dLPsgbrqSN8DXqdG8bym7vIKQgUeFVQnsEvltTcTbR-C6tt1B4Z7VuIBHCopGuhIbczH8q18VDpDEg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">was reorienting</a> its strategy to combat the rise of Chinese electric-car makers, such as BYD and Geely. </p>
<p>“If you cannot compete fair and square with the Chinese around the world, then 20% to 30% of your revenue is at risk,” Farley <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/ford-ceo-open-working-with-rivals-compete-with-china-2024-02-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> at an industry conference last month. He <a href="https://www.autonews.com/cars-concepts/ford-shifts-3-row-evs-smaller-affordable-models#:~:text=It%20reported%20Ford%20is%20planning,to%20comment%20on%20future%20product." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that Ford had set up a secret internal “skunkworks” engineering team to make an affordable electric vehicle that could compete head-to-head with Chinese models on cost. The company has delayed the release of a new electric three-row SUV in order to produce three roughly $25,000 models, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/chinese-ev-affordability-frightens-ford-gm-us-automakers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em> report</a> last week.</p>
<p>“Automakers see the future is electrified, and they see that Chinese companies will eat their lunch if they don’t get going,” Searle, the clean transportation researcher, said. “There’s no putting the genie back in the bottle.”</p>
<p>But China’s dominance was not inevitable — it was itself the result of ambitious industrial policies. Roughly 15 years ago, China identified the electric vehicle industry as a sector where it could eventually become a global leader in export markets, <a href="https://sociology.princeton.edu/people/benjamin-h-bradlow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Benjamin Bradlow</a>, a Princeton professor of sociology and international affairs, told me. </p>
<p>Since then, the country’s leaders have targeted the EV sector with generous subsidies far beyond what Americans lawmakers considered for the IRA, he said. They have also encouraged the EV industry’s geographic spread across China and <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/chinas-transition-electric-vehicles-0429" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">required</a> automakers to sell a certain percentage of EVs across their vehicle fleet.</p>
<p>“It’s a very different style of policymaking” from what America has done with the IRA, Bradlow said, although like that law it also aimed to lower the cost of technologies. “[China] is targeting a sector and it’s being very specific about being at the technological and price frontier — it’s very export-oriented.”</p>
<p>These policies have succeeded beyond imagining. China is now the world’s largest exporter of cars, and it has become a goliath in the EV industry. The country has achieved what hippies and renegades have long claimed is possible: a thriving and cutthroat electric vehicle industry, where consumers are willing to buy EVs without significant subsidies. (Indeed, China’s electric-car makers have been locked in a price war over the past year, driving even greater adoption as prices fall.) </p>
<p>These Chinese industrial policies — along with American and European-funded R&D — have cut tens of thousands of dollars from EV prices. Over the past three decades, the cost of manufacturing a battery <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/battery-price-decline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has fallen by 97%</a>, and by 2027 manufacturing a new EV battery <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/30112023/inside-clean-energy-battery-prices-are-falling/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is projected</a> to cost less than $100 a kilowatt-hour, a long-theorized benchmark at which an electric vehicle will be competitive with a gasoline vehicle. </p>
<p>In the United States, mandates and subsidies in achieving mass EV adoption have not been quite as enthusiastically received. Some 7% of new cars <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q4-2023-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold</a> in the United States last year were EVs, an all-time high. Plug-in and conventional hybrids made up an additional 8% of new car sales, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. </p>
<p>Those sales shares will need to double repeatedly in the years ahead for American automakers to meet the EPA’s new standards. And they point to at least one form of success that has alluded American policymakers so far: creating a robust, popular EV industry that can win over consumers on its own terms. </p>
<p>“The ultimate success of the policy and transition overall is a mix between policy, consumer adoption, and the automakers themselves,” Cantor, the BNEF analyst, told me. </p>
<p>For the first time ever, in other words, “automakers who fall behind may pay a far higher cost for failure to transition,” Cantor said. And that — above anything else — is what makes these EPA rules different from any that have come before. </p>

## How do you verify that?

date: 2024-03-21, from: Dave Rupert blog

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W92bjv8fNTI?si=1ZBIYPjwoY9WuypF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Hank Green posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W92bjv8fNTI">a video about four lies he believed</a>. It’s a great video because it’s embarrassing to be wrong on the internet and here is smart person™️ Hank Green admitting he believed some bullshit. As you travel through the internet you’re constantly working against a lot of personal biases, like confirmation bias or the overconfidence bias, and it’s easy to slip up. It’s (biologically) difficult to correct your understanding as new facts invalidate what you believed true.</p>
<p>One simple question I’ve started asking a lot is: “How do you verify that?”</p>
<p>I’ve seen some compelling demos where LLMs take a jumble of text and spit out compelling artifacts like an image, <a href="https://openai.com/sora">some b-roll</a>, a spreadsheet, <a href="https://salt-nlp.github.io/Design2Code/">a website</a>, or <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/podcast">an entire daily news podcast</a>. It’s incredible… until my buzzkill brain starts asking questions. Images are easy to verify: does image look correct or does it contain phantom limbs and have five rows of teeth? Text summary or expansion, also within possibility to verify. A website? I mean… I can tell you if it’s an okay website code-wise but I’m probably an outlier here. Validating the accuracy of a larger corpus of data that got summarized, keyworded, and categorized? Oof. This is where the scales tip for me because it seems improbable. Or at least time consuming. Perhaps as time consuming as it takes to do the work yourself?</p>
<p>To be fair to the robots (<em>why would I ever say this?</em>) I think it’s worth pointing the question at myself. I’ve been thinking about my “old world” method of verifying facts and determined I have the following routine.</p>
<ol>
<li>I consume a lot</li>
<li>I experiment</li>
<li>I ask experts</li>
</ol>
<p>When I say “consume a lot”, I mean I read hundreds – sometimes thousands – of articles and watch hundreds of videos each week (cf. novelty seeking, information addiction) as well as <a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">my book habit</a>. To make that theoretical knowledge more practical, I prototype and experiment to answer questions. With a basic understanding established, I often ask experts for their perspective. For web tech, that’s lots of open questions or DMs to people I know care about a specific technology. I’ll then sometimes have those people on my podcast to prod them some more.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Like loose change and shells rattling inside a coffee can, I collect all those informational tidbits and filter them through my years of experience and <a href="https://media1.giphy.com/media/gW0cPZopjtpoA/giphy.gif">how my brain works</a>. That produces an outcome I’m generally satisfied with, informed yet potentially wrong. It’s not too different from an LLM where the outputs are only as good as their inputs.</p>
<p>My inputs are sometimes flawed. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/if-books-could-kill/id1651876897">If Books Could Kill…</a> is a podcast where the hosts do takedowns of my favorite books: self-help pop-psychology airport books. They do an incredible job at on-the-fly fact checking, reading criticisms, scrutinizing every assertion, asking “Hey wait, is that true?” on every page and have nearly ruined the entire genre for me. I assume you learn this brand of skepticism in journalism school and the trade-off is that you’ll never enjoy a book again in your life. But I need to remind myself the goal of a book isn’t to get to the last page, it’s to expand your thinking.</p>
<p>I wish I did better at this (so I don’t repeat falsehoods) but collecting factoids makes me feel smart and I like feeling smart so now they’re insulated inside a little blanket of my personal biases. Fact-checking in realtime doesn’t tickle the ol’ grey matter. It doesn’t have the same dopamine response.</p>
<p>One more story and I’ll let you go. In an effort to not be a total fucking grandpa all the time I’m trying to use AI more while keeping an open mind. It’s been… challenging. But the other day I needed a fact checked – something one of my investors mentioned during our YCombinator application process that was noodling around in my head – and a regular search didn’t return any results, so I tried a trending AI search tool that provides citations.</p>
<ul>
<li>First it told me “Yes, this was true” but cited the wrong reasons.</li>
<li>So I hit it with an “Are you sure?” and it changed its answer to “No, it’s not true” but cited a random Hacker News comment that asserted the opposite.</li>
<li>So I said “Your source says the opposite” and it KFC doubledown’d and said “No, it’s not true.”</li>
<li>So I copy-pasted the text from their own source into the prompt and it said “Yes, this was true.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a… complex user journey. And it happens to me a lot. I wonder if this tech falls victim to its own compelling demos. The “<a href="https://indieweb.social/@johnallsopp/112050757204780359">Time to First Demo</a>” is so short and often so profound, we fill in the possibilities with our own projections and science fiction. It’s harder to question the quality or veracity when our imaginations and our biases get wrapped up in the idea because it might mean questioning ourselves… which is not something humans are biologically engineered to do well.</p>
<p>Okay, this is the last bit I promise. There’s one line from that Hank Green video that stands out to me in this whole self-fact-checking debacle…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was fine with having the [mis]information put into my head, but when I put it into someone else’s head, I felt a little weird about it so I went to check just in case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems like a humane approach to sharing information. Be liberal in what you accept, fact-check on the way out. I hope I can get better at that.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>Asking experts isn’t limited to tech either, if I share an area of interest with someone and they recommend an album, movie, coffee, book, or menu item; I’ll take them up on it. I’ll implicitly trust them to guide my experience. In Japan this is <em>omakase</em> and it’s transcendent. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

## Why the GOP Is Mad at the IEA

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Minneapolis is expecting snow tonight. Less than a month ago it was 65 degrees Fahrenheit in the Twin Cities • More than 100 people were evacuated from the small Australian town of Borroloola ahead of severe flooding • It is cloudy in Copenhagen where global climate leaders are <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6e44bb9496&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting</a> to hash out a plan for COP29.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. EPA unveils final auto emission rules</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration announced final new emissions standards for cars yesterday, significantly curtailing both the carbon dioxide and the toxic soot and chemicals that spew from the tailpipes of the nation’s light- and medium-duty vehicles. The rules tighten pollution limits gradually over six years, and are slightly watered down compared to the version released last April: While automakers will still have to achieve the same emissions standard by 2032 as what was originally proposed, they will now be able to transition more slowly, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f8ceb16b61&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained Emily Pontecorvo and Robinson Meyer at Heatmap</a>. Administration officials argue that giving automakers, dealers, and labor unions more time in the near-term will make for a sturdier rule, and that the cumulative emissions benefits of the final standard converge with the original proposal. The EPA now estimates that EVs may make up anywhere between 30% and 56% of new light-duty sales from model years 2030 to 2032, and by 2032, the light-duty fleet on offer from automakers will emit half as much carbon as vehicles on the market in 2026.
</p><h3>2. GOP lawmakers accuse IEA of undermining energy security</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A group of senior Republican lawmakers <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=09f7de9715&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">penned a letter</a> to Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, accusing the group of “undermining energy security” and being a cheerleader for the “energy transition” (quotes theirs). The letter suggests the IEA has lost its credibility as a reliable and objective source of information on fossil fuel markets, and has focused too heavily on clean energy developments and too little on “the things that matter most to policymakers.” The letter is signed by House energy committee chair Cathy McMorris-Rodgers and Sen.

The agency's work is constantly cited by policymakers, academics, journalists and civil society groups.” The IEA’s forecasts that oil demand could peak by 2030 have perturbed fossil fuel producers. OPEC sees growth continuing at least through 2045. Earlier this week the CEO of Saudi Aramco called a fossil fuel phase-out a “fantasy.”

The World Meteorological Organization has six lists of names for northeast Pacific hurricanes that it uses over and over again, so it’s not uncommon for two different storms occurring years apart to have the same name. But a name is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d5003524cb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed</a> if a storm is “so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of sensitivity.” Hurricane Otis struck Acapulco in October last year, killing 51 people and causing $3 billion in damage. Dora played an “indirect meteorological role” in Maui’s massive wildfires, which killed more than 100 people and caused at least $4 billion in damages. Otis and Dora will be replaced with the names Otilio and Debora.

## Why we're lucky WordPress is here and other topics

date: 2024-03-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I spent some time this week reviewing the UI of Radio UserLand, released in 2002. It was both a feed reader and a writing tool. </p>
<p>One would have thought, btw, that from that start that all subsequent blogging tools would have the same connections, even if the functionality was not all in the same product. But then came Twitter and Facebook, and they said they weren't blogs, and presumably would start a new tradition with new user expectations. And that worked. The new blogging platforms were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_silo">silos</a>.</p>
<p>So the integration opportunities were limited, something that took me 11 years to fully appreciate, and to <a href="http://scripting.com/2017/05/05/iWantMyOldBlogBack.html">give up</a> on. I was in a intellectual cloud, not thinking straight. </p>
<p>Meantime, the tradition of blogging was preserved by WordPress. As a blogging tool, it supported the same connective features that Radio did. There were some it couldn't cover because Radio was a desktop app, not a web app (though it looked like a web app, you installed a piece of software on the desktop). </p>
<p>This was the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html">Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server</a> idea realized. </p>
<p>So for example, we had <a href="http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/howUpstreamingWorks">upstreaming</a>, which was a one-way Dropbox, a number of years before Dropbox existed. This meant that the link between the CMS and the server went through the file system. The product didn't live long enough to fulfill the potential of that feature. The idea was that you could use any editor you wanted to write something that was posted to the blog, you could choose to have it rendered through the site template, or uploaded as-is. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png">editor</a> we supplied with Radio was one of those <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text boxes</a>, but I hoped that better editors would emerge. I wanted to make one myself, combining the outliner in Frontier with scripting, to drop posts into the folder structure that Radio expected. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png"></center>Radio's tiny little textbox circa 2002.</div></p>
<p>Years later I tried to do it with Dropbox itself, with a product called <a href="http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html">Fargo</a>. Dropbox was so incredibly close to the ideal user-owned storage server system, but they wouldn't go the final step, in creating a class of content that could be shared with two or more apps but not all apps. So the user didn't have enough control for it to work. </p>
<p>The idea of multiple apps working on the same data would be revolutionary. How do I know? Because that's how computers worked before the web. So to make the thing I want to do work, now, in 2024, I'm going to have to create my own storage system for the user, and I will pay for it, at least to start. </p>
<p>Hopefully at some point I'll be able to turn that over to Automattic and have them run it, or if they don't want to, maybe someone else will. But it has to be there for the web as a runtime environment to support the same diversity of software that the PC and Mac did in the generation before the web. </p>
<p>Technology does go backwards, a lot -- we lose valuable things without any thought, when we could keep them. </p>
<p>BTW, that's why it's good to keep some old people around, we might remember the things that were lost. I'm trying to make sure the really good ideas, the keepers, get another chance. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/blogrollscreen.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Another random morning bit -- something subtle in the blogroll you might not have noticed. It has no trouble dealing with titled or untitled posts. Blog posts typically have titles, social media posts do not. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> is opinionated about this -- it <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/rssIsOpinionatedAboutOptionalTitles.png">says</a> you should support both views. But the feed reader folk ignored that guidance. My little blogroll shows you how to do it, it's pretty simple. <span>If it doesn't have a title use the description</span>. </p>
<p>Think of it this way. What if motorcycles, cars, trucks and bikes couldn't all use the same roads? What kind of way would that be to run a civilization. Same thing with feeds. </p>
<p>There's a screen shot of the blogroll to the right, with Scripting News highlighted and expanded. Some of those posts have titles and some don't. You and I as developers care about that, but we shouldn't show that difference that in the user interface. The users don't care and rightly so. It's confusing and takes their attention away from the writing. </p>
<p>Another topic. Something I noticed in WordPress's RSS feeds. If I start a post out with an empty title, it uses the post ID to form the URL for the post. That's the right thing to do imho. But then if I add a title, which can happen, it changes the URL to use the title. But URLs shouldn't change. It also changes the guid, so a feed reader will think there were two posts when there was just one. Now I don't know if they can change it at this late date, I imagine there are workarounds out there. But I noticed this the other day, and thought I should mention it. Why not just use the post ID for the guid, esp since it says the guid is not a permalink? And use it in forming the URL. I totally understand the benefit of using the title in the URL. But you can't depend on the title being there. </p>
<p>Finally, to answer the question raised by the title of this piece -- WordPress is, among other things, a perfect time capsule of open technologies from the early days of innovation on the web, and widely deployed and able to deliver all their benefits, if we widen our view of social media to be a <i>social web,</i> and simply create places where posts with and without titles are equally supported. It's that simple. Without WordPress we would have to build all that, and wait for it to deploy in numbers, to matter in the market. All we have to do now is make the connections. </p>

But what does the Fed need to see before it’ll actually lower rates? We&#8217;ll discuss. Then, Hermès faces a class-action lawsuit over Birkin bag sales.

## US Congress Releases $1.1 Trillion Spending Package to Avert Shutdown

date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA

Washington — After days of delay, U.S. congressional leaders unveiled a $1.1 trillion bipartisan spending measure for defense, homeland security and other programs early on Thursday, giving lawmakers less than two days to avert a partial government shutdown. 

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives will vote on the sprawling package on Friday, leaving the Democratic-majority Senate only hours to pass the package of six bills that covers about two-thirds of the $1.66 trillion in discretionary government spending for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. 

"These final six bills represent a bipartisan and bicameral compromise," the two top Senate negotiators - Patty Murray, a Democrat, and Susan Collins, a Republican - said in a statement. 

"They will invest in the American people, build a stronger economy, help keep our communities safe, and strengthen our national security and global leadership." 

The Congressional Budget Office warned that U.S. deficits and debt will grow considerably over the next 30 years, forecasting that the nation's $34.5 trillion national debt, which currently represents about 99% of GDP, could grow and rise to 166% of GDP by 2054. 

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he is "hopeful" Congress can avert a shutdown if Democrats and Republicans in his chamber work together. 

The compressed schedule raised the risk of at least a brief partial shutdown after a Friday midnight deadline, unless Schumer can reach agreement with Senate Republicans to expedite the bill. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson touted what he called a series of wins for Republicans, from higher spending for U.S. defense and border security to a cutoff of U.S. funding for the main United Nations relief agency that provides humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza. 

"This FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission," Johnson said in a statement released along with the text of the legislation. 

Democrats said they blocked some Republican cuts and policy measures and touted funds aimed at lowering childcare costs, supporting small businesses and fighting the flow of the opioid fentanyl. 

"We defeated outlandish cuts that would have been a gut punch for American families and our economy - and we fought off scores of extreme policies that would have restricted Americans’ fundamental freedoms, hurt consumers while giving giant corporations an unfair advantage, and turned back the clock on historic climate action," said Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 

Two weeks ago, Congress narrowly avoided a shutdown that would have affected agricultural, transportation and environmental programs. 

The text unveiled on Thursday fills in the details of an agreement in principle between Johnson and Schumer, which Democratic President Joe Biden has pledged to sign into law. 

With a slim 219-213 House Republican majority, Johnson will have to rely on Democratic votes to get the spending bill to the Senate. 

Many House Republicans are still expected to oppose the legislation, including hardliners who want steeper spending cuts. 

Besides the departments of Homeland Security and Defense, the bill would fund agencies including the State Department and the Internal Revenue Service as it girds for its April 15 taxpayer filing deadline.

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The Balkan state Kosovo, which broke away from Serbia in 2008 after a bitter civil war in the late 1990s, currently doesn&#8217;t accept transactions in the Serbian dinar. But some Serb-majority areas are still reliant on the currency. We&#8217;ll hear more. But first, a Chinese-funded port in Pakistan was attacked by militants. We&#8217;ll detail what exactly happened.</p>

<p>As computer vision researchers, we believe that every pixel can tell a story. However, there seems to be a writer’s block settling into the field when it comes to dealing with large images. Large images are no longer rare—the cameras we carry in our pockets and those orbiting our planet snap pictures so big and detailed that they stretch our current best models and hardware to their breaking points when handling them. Generally, we face a quadratic increase in memory usage as a function of image size.</p>

<p>Today, we make one of two sub-optimal choices when handling large images: down-sampling or cropping. These two methods incur significant losses in the amount of information and context present in an image. We take another look at these approaches and introduce $x$T, a new framework to model large images end-to-end on contemporary GPUs while effectively aggregating global context with local details.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/xt/xt.png" width="100%" />
<br />
<i>Architecture for the $x$T framework.</i>
</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="why-bother-with-big-images-anyway">Why Bother with Big Images Anyway?</h2>
<p>Why bother handling large images anyways? Picture yourself in front of your TV, watching your favorite football team. The field is dotted with players all over with action occurring only on a small portion of the screen at a time. Would you be satisified, however, if you could only see a small region around where the ball currently was? Alternatively, would you be satisified watching the game in low resolution? Every pixel tells a story, no matter how far apart they are. This is true in all domains from your TV screen to a pathologist viewing a gigapixel slide to diagnose tiny patches of cancer. These images are treasure troves of information. If we can’t fully explore the wealth because our tools can’t handle the map, what’s the point?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/xt/football.png" width="90%" />
<br />
<i>Sports are fun when you know what's going on.</i>
</p>

<p>That’s precisely where the frustration lies today. The bigger the image, the more we need to simultaneously zoom out to see the whole picture and zoom in for the nitty-gritty details, making it a challenge to grasp both the forest and the trees simultaneously. Most current methods force a choice between losing sight of the forest or missing the trees, and neither option is great.</p>

<h2 id="how-xt-tries-to-fix-this">How $x$T Tries to Fix This</h2>
<p>Imagine trying to solve a massive jigsaw puzzle. Instead of tackling the whole thing at once, which would be overwhelming, you start with smaller sections, get a good look at each piece, and then figure out how they fit into the bigger picture. That’s basically what we do with large images with $x$T.</p>

<p>$x$T takes these gigantic images and chops them into smaller, more digestible pieces hierarchically. This isn’t just about making things smaller, though. It’s about understanding each piece in its own right and then, using some clever techniques, figuring out how these pieces connect on a larger scale. It’s like having a conversation with each part of the image, learning its story, and then sharing those stories with the other parts to get the full narrative.</p>

<h2 id="nested-tokenization">Nested Tokenization</h2>
<p>At the core of $x$T lies the concept of nested tokenization. In simple terms, tokenization in the realm of computer vision is akin to chopping up an image into pieces (tokens) that a model can digest and analyze. However, $x$T takes this a step further by introducing a hierarchy into the process—hence, <em>nested</em>.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re tasked with analyzing a detailed city map. Instead of trying to take in the entire map at once, you break it down into districts, then neighborhoods within those districts, and finally, streets within those neighborhoods. This hierarchical breakdown makes it easier to manage and understand the details of the map while keeping track of where everything fits in the larger picture. That’s the essence of nested tokenization—we split an image into regions, each which can be split into further sub-regions depending on the input size expected by a vision backbone (what we call a <em>region encoder</em>), before being patchified to be processed by that region encoder. This nested approach allows us to extract features at different scales on a local level.</p>

<h2 id="coordinating-region-and-context-encoders">Coordinating Region and Context Encoders</h2>
<p>Once an image is neatly divided into tokens, $x$T employs two types of encoders to make sense of these pieces: the region encoder and the context encoder. Each plays a distinct role in piecing together the image’s full story.</p>

<p>The region encoder is a standalone “local expert” which converts independent regions into detailed representations. However, since each region is processed in isolation, no information is shared across the image at large. The region encoder can be any state-of-the-art vision backbone. In our experiments we have utilized hierarchical vision transformers such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09883">Swin</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00989">Hiera</a> and also CNNs such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545">ConvNeXt</a>!</p>

<p>Enter the context encoder, the big-picture guru. Its job is to take the detailed representations from the region encoders and stitch them together, ensuring that the insights from one token are considered in the context of the others. The context encoder is generally a long-sequence model. We experiment with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860">Transformer-XL</a> (and our variant of it called <em>Hyper</em>) and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a>, though you could use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150">Longformer</a> and other new advances in this area. Even though these long-sequence models are generally made for language, we demonstrate that it is possible to use them effectively for vision tasks.</p>

<p>The magic of $x$T is in how these components—the nested tokenization, region encoders, and context encoders—come together. By first breaking down the image into manageable pieces and then systematically analyzing these pieces both in isolation and in conjunction, $x$T manages to maintain the fidelity of the original image’s details while also integrating long-distance context the overarching context <strong>while fitting massive images, end-to-end, on contemporary GPUs</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>We evaluate $x$T on challenging benchmark tasks that span well-established computer vision baselines to rigorous large image tasks. Particularly, we experiment with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06642">iNaturalist 2018</a> for fine-grained species classification, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/f4d4a021f9051a6c18183b059117e8b5-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf">xView3-SAR</a> for context-dependent segmentation, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0312">MS-COCO</a> for detection.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/xt/model_performance_plot_mamba.png" width="90%" />
<br />
<i>Powerful vision models used with $x$T set a new frontier on downstream tasks such as fine-grained species classification.</i>
</p>

<p>Our experiments show that $x$T can achieve higher accuracy on all downstream tasks with fewer parameters while using much less memory per region than state-of-the-art baselines<sup>*</sup>. We are able to model images as large as 29,000 x 25,000 pixels large on 40GB A100s while comparable baselines run out of memory at only 2,800 x 2,800 pixels.</p>

<br />
<i>Powerful vision models used with $x$T set a new frontier on downstream tasks such as fine-grained species classification.</i>
</p>

<p><sup>*</sup><em>Depending on your choice of context model, such as Transformer-XL</em>.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-more-than-you-think">Why This Matters More Than You Think</h2>
<p>This approach isn’t just cool; it’s necessary. For scientists tracking climate change or doctors diagnosing diseases, it’s a game-changer. It means creating models which understand the full story, not just bits and pieces. In environmental monitoring, for example, being able to see both the broader changes over vast landscapes and the details of specific areas can help in understanding the bigger picture of climate impact. In healthcare, it could mean the difference between catching a disease early or not.</p>

<p>We are not claiming to have solved all the world’s problems in one go. We are hoping that with $x$T we have opened the door to what’s possible. We’re stepping into a new era where we don’t have to compromise on the clarity or breadth of our vision. $x$T is our big leap towards models that can juggle the intricacies of large-scale images without breaking a sweat.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more ground to cover. Research will evolve, and hopefully, so will our ability to process even bigger and more complex images. In fact, we are working on follow-ons to $x$T which will expand this frontier further.</p>
