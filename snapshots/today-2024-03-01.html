<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The National Urban League is out with its latest assessment on the State
of Black America, which measures racial inequality in areas including
employment, health care, housing and criminal justice. While some gaps
have closed, others still have a long way to go. We’ll discuss. Plus,
Wall Street is betting on a boom fueled by AI and falling interest
rates, and theaters hope the “Dune” sequel will get moviegoers back in
seats.

<p>
In a new product I’m working on, I’m including links to the blogs of the
social media apps I use. I notice that most of them have one. This is
why:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
You can put a title on a post on a blog.
</li>
<li>
You can include links (invariably announcements have links).
</li>
<li>
You can edit posts.
</li>
<li>
Simple text styling.
</li>
<li>
Blogs have feeds.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So I’m looking for the official blogs of the social apps I use –
Mastodon, Bluesky, Twitter, Threads.
</p>
<p>
If so, what’s the feed URL?

<ol type="1">
<li>EPA to relax power plant emissions rules
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration is
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=28fb144e94&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">making
changes</a> to its sweeping plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from
power plants while it figures out a new, more ambitious rule. Here’s a
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b92515efa8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TL;DR</a>
version of what’s happening.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The old plan: </strong>Existing coal plants, existing gas-fired
plants, and gas plants built in the future would be required to
dramatically reduce their carbon dioxide emissions by 2040.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The new (temporary) plan:</strong> Existing coal plants and new
gas plants must still dramatically reduce their emissions. But existing
gas plants are exempt.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The end goal:</strong> The Environmental Protection Agency wants
a “stronger” rule that can “achieve greater emissions reductions.” This
means covering the entire fleet of gas plants, and addressing toxic air
pollutants, not just greenhouse gases.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The reaction:</strong> Extremely mixed. Environmental groups
that had called for tougher restrictions are pleased. But so are some
utility groups that wanted the rules weakened, and see the delay as an
acknowledgment of their concerns. Rhode Island’s Democratic Sen. Sheldon
Whitehouse said “failing to cover the plants responsible for the vast
majority of future carbon pollution from the power sector makes no
sense.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>The rub:</strong> The new rules probably won’t come into place
until after Election Day, if at all. The decision comes as the
administration is widely expected to relax tailpipe emissions rules, and
“would call into question the ability of the United States to meet the
president’s goal of cutting United States emissions roughly in half by
the end of this decade,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=733130ea0c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Biden says Chinese EVs could be a security risk
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>More news from Washington: The Biden administration
yesterday opened an investigation into the national security risks posed
by Chinese-made “connected vehicles,” which essentially means any
vehicle or any car part that connects to the internet,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=65035670bf&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>
<em>Heatmap</em>’s Robinson Meyer. New cars, especially EVs, are
outfitted with cameras, sensors, or cellular modems required for modern
safety features. The investigation isn’t hugely surprising, but it “is a
big deal, in part because it marks that the backlash to Chinese EVs has
begun in earnest in the U.S.,” Meyer wrote. And it shows that “tariffs
alone probably can’t keep Chinese-branded EVs out of the American market
forever.”

<li>Equinor and Orsted win New York offshore wind auction
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>New York’s offshore wind industry is back, or at least
back in contract. Two offshore wind projects, Empire Wind 1 and Sunrise
Wind, have been awarded, respectively, to developers Equinor and the
partnership of Orsted and Eversource. These two projects, which would
amount to 1,700 megawatts of capacity in total (enough to power about a
million homes, according to Governor Kathy Hochul’s office), had first
been bid out in 2019 and then rebid when these same developers were
unable to renegotiate their contracts to deal with rising material and
interest rate costs. “But merely (re-)awarding the contracts does not
ensure that steel goes into the water, let alone that electrons flow
into homes,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6b2b80363a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>
<em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin. Sunrise Wind will likely be
completed in 2026. Orsted has to hammer out the details of a new
contract, and only then finally decide whether to go through with the
thing or not; that’s expected to happen sometime in the second quarter
of this year, with federal permitting finished in the summer. Empire
Wind 1 has a similar timeline.

<strong></strong>There’s bad news and good news in the International
Energy Agency’s

Emissions in 2023</a> report. Let’s start with the bad news, so we can
end on a positive note. Energy-related carbon emissions are still going
up. Emissions increased by 1.1% in 2023, largely due to hydropower
shortfalls caused by drought. The sooner we can stop pumping new carbon
into the atmosphere, the better our chances of avoiding the worst
effects of climate change. But there are glimmers of hope in the report:
Last year’s rise was less extreme than the year before even though
energy demand growth accelerated, and “without clean energy
technologies, the global increase in CO2 emissions in the last five
years would have been three times larger.” And the report finds that
between 2019 to 2023, clean energy growth was twice as large as fossil
fuel growth.

The CEO of Toyota isn’t mincing words, saying that he believes EVs will
only make up 30% of the US new-vehicle market in 2030, half of the
target the EPA sought last year. As the car industry’s largest hybrid
pusher, Toyota says it is better positioned to just buy credits to close
the EPA gap rather than “waste” money on BEVs, its CEO said.

Amazon’s financial shell game let it create an “impossible” monopoly (01
Mar 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Amazon’s financial shell game let it create an
“impossible” monopoly: If you think the company’s profits come from AWS,
you’ve been suckered, too. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This
day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications,

Amazon’s financial shell game let it create an “impossible” monopoly
(permalink) For the pro-monopoly crowd that absolutely dominated
antitrust law from the Carter administration until 2020, Amazon presents
a genuinely puzzling paradox: the company’s monopoly power was never
supposed to emerge, and if it did, it should have crumbled immediately.
Pro-monopoly economists embody Ely Devons’s famous aphorism that “If
economists wished to study the horse, they wouldn’t go and look at
horses. They’d sit in their studies and say to themselves, ‘What would I
do if I were a horse?’”:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/27/economism/#what-would-i-do-if-i-were-a-horse
Rather than using the way the world actually works as their starting
point for how to think about it, they build elaborate models out of
abstract principles like “rational actors.” The resulting mathematical
models are so abstractly elegant that it’s easy to forget that they’re
just imaginative exercises, disconnected from reality:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/03/all-models-are-wrong/#some-are-useful
These models predicted that it would be impossible for Amazon to attain
monopoly power. Even if they became a monopoly – in the sense of
dominating sales of various kinds of goods – the company still wouldn’t
get monopoly power. For example, if Amazon tried to take over a category
by selling goods below cost (“predatory pricing”), then rivals could
just wait until the company got tired of losing money and put prices
back up, and then those rivals could go back to competing. And if Amazon
tried to keep the loss-leader going indefinitely by “cross-subsidizing”
the losses with high-margin profits from some other part of its
business, rivals could sell those high margin goods at a lower margin,
which would lure away Amazon customers and cut the supply lines for the
price war it was fighting with its discounted products. That’s what the
model predicted, but it’s not what happened in the real world. In the
real world, Amazon was able use its access to the capital markets to
embark on scorched-earth predatory pricing campaigns. When diapers.com
refused to sell out to Amazon, the company casually committed $100m to
selling diapers below cost. Diapers.com went bust, Amazon bought it for
pennies on the dollar and shut it down:
https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18563379/amazon-predatory-pricing-antitrust-law
Investors got the message: don’t compete with Amazon. They can remain
predatory longer than you can remain solvent. Now, not everyone shared
the antitrust establishment’s confidence that Amazon couldn’t create a
durable monopoly with market power. In 2017, Lina Khan – then a third
year law student – published “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” a landmark
paper arguing that Amazon had all the tools it needed to amass monopoly
power: https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox
Today, Khan is chair of the FTC, and has brought a case against Amazon
that builds on some of the theories from that paper. One outcome of that
suit is an unprecedented look at Amazon’s internal operations. But, as
the Institute for Local Self-Reliance’s Stacy Mitchell describes in a
piece for The Atlantic, key pieces of information have been totally
redacted in the court exhibits:
https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/02/amazon-profits-antitrust-ftc/677580/
The most important missing datum: how much money Amazon makes from each
of its lines of business. Amazon’s own story is that it basically breaks
even on its retail operation, and keeps the whole business afloat with
profits from its AWS cloud computing division. This is an important
narrative, because if it’s true, then Amazon can’t be forcing up retail
prices, which is the crux of the FTC’s case against the company. Here’s
what we know for sure about Amazon’s retail business. First: merchants
can’t live without Amazon. The majority of US households have Prime, and
90% of Prime households start their ecommerce searches on Amazon; if
they find what they’re looking for, they buy it and stop. Thus,
merchants who don’t sell on Amazon just don’t sell. This is called
“monopsony power” and it’s a lot easier to maintain than monopoly power.
For most manufacturers, a 10% overnight drop in sales is a catastrophe,
so a retailer that commands even a 10% market-share can extract huge
concessions from its suppliers. Amazon’s share of most categories of
goods is a lot higher than 10%! What kind of monopsony power does Amazon
wield? Well, for one thing, it is able to levy a huge tax on its
sellers. Add up all the junk-fees Amazon charges its platform sellers
and it comes out to 45-51%:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/#commissar-bezos
Competitive businesses just don’t have 45% margins! No one can afford to
kick that much back to Amazon. What is a merchant to do? Sell on Amazon
and you lose money on every sale. Don’t sell on Amazon and you don’t get
any business. The only answer: raise prices on Amazon. After all, Prime
customers – the majority of Amazon’s retail business – don’t shop for
competitive prices. If Amazon wants a 45% vig, you can raise your Amazon
prices by a third and just about break even. But Amazon is wise to that:
they have a “most favored nation” rule that punishes suppliers who sell
goods more cheaply in rival stores, or even on their own site. The
punishments vary, from banishing your products to page ten million of
search-results to simply kicking you off the platform. With publishers,
Amazon reserves the right to lower the prices they set when listing
their books, to match the lowest price on the web, and paying publishers
less for each sale. That means that suppliers who sell on Amazon (which
is anyone who wants to stay in business) have to dramatically hike their
prices on Amazon, and when they do, they also have to hike their prices
everywhere else (no wonder Prime customers don’t bother to search
elsewhere for a better deal!). Now, Amazon says this is all wrong. That
45-51% vig they claim from business customers is barely enough to break
even. The company’s profits – they insist – come from selling AWS cloud
service. The retail operation is just a public service they provide to
us with cross-subsidy from those fat AWS margins. This is a hell of a
claim. Last year, Amazon raked in $130 billion in seller fees. In other
words: they booked more revenue from junk fees than Bank of America made
through its whole operation. Amazon’s junk fees add up to more than all
of Meta’s revenues:
https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/AMZN-Q4-2023-Earnings-Release.pdf
Amazon claims that none of this is profit – it’s just covering their
operating expenses. According to Amazon, its non-AWS units combined have
a one percent profit margin. Now, this is an eye-popping claim indeed.
Amazon is a public company, which means that it has to make thorough
quarterly and annual financial disclosures breaking down its profit and
loss. You’d think that somewhere in those disclosures, we’d find some
details. You’d think so, but you’d be wrong. Amazon’s disclosures do not
break out profits and losses by segment. SEC rules actually require the
company to make these per-segment disclosures:
https://scholarship.law.stjohns.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3524&amp;amp;context=lawreview#:~:text=If%20a%20company%20has%20more,income%20taxes%20and%20extraordinary%20items.
That rule was enacted in 1966, out of concern that companies could use
cross-subsidies to fund predatory pricing and other anticompetitive
practices. But over the years, the SEC just…stopped enforcing the rule.
Companies have “near total managerial discretion” to lump business units
together and group their profits and losses in bloated, undifferentiated
balance-sheet items:
https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/public-purpose/publications/2021/dec/crouching-tiger-hidden-dragons
As Mitchell points you, it’s not just Amazon that flouts this rule. We
don’t know how much money Google makes on Youtube, or how much Apple
makes from the App Store (Apple told a federal judge that this number
doesn’t exist). Warren Buffett – with significant interest in hundreds
of companies across dozens of markets – only breaks out seven segments
of profit-and-loss for Berkshire Hathaway. Recall that there is one
category of data from the FTC’s antitrust case against Amazon that has
been completely redacted. One guess which category that is! Yup, the
profit-and-loss for its retail operation and other lines of business.
These redactions are the judge’s fault, but the real fault lies with the
SEC. Amazon is a public company. In exchange for access to the capital
markets, it owes the public certain disclosures, which are set out in
the SEC’s rulebook. The SEC lets Amazon – and other gigantic companies –
get away with a degree of secrecy that should disqualify it from
offering stock to the public. As Mitchell says, SEC chairman Gary
Gensler should adopt “new rules that more concretely define what
qualifies as a segment and remove the discretion given to executives.”
Amazon is the poster-child for monopoly run amok. As Yanis Varoufakis
writes in Technofeudalism, Amazon has actually become a post-capitalist
enterprise. Amazon doesn’t make profits (money derived from selling
goods); it makes rents (money charged to people who are seeking to make
a profit): https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/28/cloudalists/#cloud-capital
Profits are the defining characteristic of a capitalist economy; rents
are the defining characteristic of feudalism. Amazon looks like a bazaar
where thousands of merchants offer goods for sale to the public, but
look harder and you discover that all those stallholders are totally
controlled by Amazon. Amazon decides what goods they can sell, how much
they cost, and whether a customer ever sees them. And then Amazon takes
$0.45-51 out of every dollar. Amazon’s “marketplace” isn’t like a flea
market, it’s more like the interconnected shops on Disneyland’s Main
Street, USA: the sign over the door might say “20th Century Music
Company” or “Emporium,” but they’re all just one store, run by one
company. And because Amazon has so much control over its sellers, it is
able to exercise power over its buyers. Amazon’s search results push
down the best deals on the platform and promote results from more
expensive, lower-quality items whose sellers have paid a fortune for an
“ad” (not really an ad, but rather the top spot in search listings):
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/29/aethelred-the-unready/#not-one-penny-for-tribute
This is “Amazon’s pricing paradox.” Amazon can claim that it offers
low-priced, high-quality goods on the platform, but it makes $38b/year
pushing those good deals way, way down in its search results. The top
result for your Amazon search averages 29% more expensive than the best
deal Amazon offers. Buy something from those first four spots and you’ll
pay a 25% premium. On average, you need to pick the seventeenth item on
the search results page to get the best deal:
https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/3645/ For 40 years,
pro-monopoly economists claimed that it would be impossible for Amazon
to attain monopoly power over buyers and sellers. Today, Amazon
exercises that power so thoroughly that its junk-fee revenues alone
exceed the total revenues of Bank of America. Amazon’s story – that
these fees barely stretch to covering its costs – assumes a nearly
inconceivable level of credulity in its audience. Regrettably – for the
human race – there is a cohort of senior, highly respected economists
who possess this degree of credulity and more. Of course, there’s an
easy way to settle the argument: Amazon could just comply with SEC regs
and break out its P&amp;L for its e-commerce operation. I assure you,
they’re not hiding this data because they think you’ll be pleasantly
surprised when they do and they don’t want to spoil the moment. (Image:

more rail strikes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Pay negotiations between German’s
national rail operator Deutsche Bahn and its drivers’ union have broken
down, threatening six days of rail strikes. Then, the G20 is seriously
considering a global minimum tax for billionaires. And yesterday was
leap day, meaning that people in France had the chance to buy a
newspaper that only comes out every four years.

Might Be on the Verge of Passing the Year’s First Climate Law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTYwMjg1Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjE0MTAwOX0.yJEIDUoOcvEUsIGZCK4uILLbDtaGuPcT5jEHShNyfEk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Congress appears to be very close to passing the first climate law of
2024. But don’t look for the word ’climate‘ in it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On Wednesday, the House voted overwhelmingly to pass the Atomic Energy
Advancement Act, a bill designed to update nuclear energy laws and
regulations to better accommodate newer, advanced nuclear reactor
designs. <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
Nuclear plants are the largest source of clean energy in the U.S. and
building more of them is one of the rare climate solutions that
Republicans and Democrats can agree on. Electricity demand is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_blank">surging
for the first time in decades</a>, thanks in part to the boom in
domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels,
and other devices needed for the energy transition. In addition to not
producing greenhouse gas emissions, nuclear plants are uniquely equipped
to help meet that demand because they are extremely reliable and can run
at near-full capacity pretty much 24/7.
</p>
<p>
And yet nuclear technology is in an awkward phase in the U.S. Recent
attempts to build old-school reactors have ended up years behind
schedule and gone billions over budget. Meanwhile, there are lots of
companies itching to deploy newer designs, but U.S. nuclear policy is
geared toward the older tech and it’s not easy for newer ideas to break
through.
</p>
<p>
The House bill aims to address this, first and foremost, by directing
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the federal body that issues nuclear
plant licenses, to update its mission statement. The new vision for the
agency would be to operate “in a manner that is efficient and does not
unnecessarily limit the potential of nuclear energy to improve the
general welfare and the benefits of nuclear energy technology to
society.” Though it’s not spelled out explicitly, that includes the
climate benefits.
</p>
<p>
Republican Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina, who was one of the bill’s
lead sponsors, said in a statement that expanding U.S. nuclear “both
here and abroad” is essential both to reducing emissions and to
“building durable economic and strategic relationships around the world”
— a reference, most likely, to the growing nuclear ambitions of China
and Russia. But he was also motivated by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-haley-south-carolina" target="_blank">challenges
much closer to home</a>.
</p>
<p>
“South Carolina is growing which means our power demand is increasing,”
Duncan said. “My home state uses twice as much energy as we produce
which is leading to a resource adequacy crisis in the state — while the
Nation also sits on the precipice of an energy crisis. The good news for
South Carolina is that we are blessed with expertise in nuclear
technology.”
</p>
<p>
The bill comes on the heels of COP28, the United Nations Climate
Conference held in December, <strong></strong>where<strong> </strong>the
Biden administration signed on to an international declaration to
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/cop28-countries-launch-declaration-triple-nuclear-energy-capacity-2050-recognizing-key" target="_blank">triple
nuclear energy by 2050</a> in order to reduce emissions and keep global
temperatures from climbing to catastrophic heights.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The change in mission statement is particularly important,
Adam Stein, the director of the nuclear energy innovation program at the
Breakthrough Institute told me. He said the NRC has a fairly broad
mandate from Congress, but unlike other federal agencies that consider
costs and benefits in their decision-making, the Commission currently
focuses exclusively on safety. “The agency’s self-imposed limitations
prevent a comprehensive evaluation of its role in addressing crucial
societal challenges such as climate change and clean energy adoption.”
He said the amendment would empower the Commission to consider a wider
array of factors, including public health, environmental protection, and
national energy goals.
</p>
<p>
To live up to this new ethos, the Commission would have to establish
practices for evaluating applications that enable faster and more
predictable reviews. The bill directs the NRC to streamline
environmental assessments,
<a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/blog/congress-gives-nod-to-environmental-permitting-reform" target="_blank">in
line with the National Environmental Policy Act reforms</a> Congress
passed last summer, and establish nuclear-specific “categorical
exclusions,” or actions that do not require environmental review. It
also boosts the NRC’s staffing capacity to process applications more
efficiently.
</p>
<p>
The NRC would also have to develop an expedited process for applicants
using previously licensed reactor designs and that plan to build on or
adjacent to an existing nuclear plant. Today the process can take five
years, and the Commission must limit it, in these cases, to 25 months
max. The Commission would also have to lower the fees it charges
companies to apply for licenses.
</p>
<p>
The bill contains other reforms, including directing the Commission to
create a separate regulatory framework for fusion reactors. The
Department of Energy would have to update export requirements to
encourage the deployment of U.S. technologies abroad. The bill also
creates a pilot project, directing the DOE to enter into a long-term
power purchase agreement with a yet-to-be-built, first-of-a-kind nuclear
plant by the end of 2028. Such an agreement would give the lucky
developer the certainty they need to finance a riskier project.
</p>
<p>
Now, the legislation will head to the Senate, which will have to
reconcile it with a bill passed last summer called the
<a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2023/7/senate-passes-bipartisan-nuclear-energy-bill-from-capito-carper-whitehouse" target="_blank">Advance
Act</a> that contained many — but not all — of the same policies and
programs.
</p>
<p>
“I think when you compare those you’ll see relatively broad agreement
between the House and the Senate that something needs to be done here,”
Evan Chapman, the U.S. federal policy director at Clean Air Task Force,
told me.<del></del>

<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is the 27th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where
I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today
we have Cassidy Williams and her blog,
<a href="https://blog.cassidoo.co">cassidoo.co</a>
</p>
<p>
To follow this series
<a href="https://peopleandblogs.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">subscribe
to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every
Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the
interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.
</p>
<hr />
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m Cassidy, I live in Chicago and love building things! I started
coding after I had a chance encounter with a neighbor when I walked home
from school in 8th grade. I heard them say, “check out my website,” and
I didn’t realize you could have your own website. From there I just
scoured the internet teaching myself everything I could about making
them! I went on to study computer science at Iowa State University, got
deep into the hackathon scene, lived in Spain, in the Bay Area, in NYC,
and in Seattle, and tried out a bunch of jobs at mostly startups, with
some larger companies in between. I love teaching and making things for
fun and utility!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’ve been blogging on and off for almost 20 years. My current blog
doesn’t actually have all of my writing in it (yet?) because sometimes
it’s on my own domains, sometimes for companies, sometimes just out in
the open. I get a lot of value from writing things I learn (because I
often run into problems again, I’ve run into my own blog posts while
debugging something multiple times), and so I try to do it regularly in
case it might be able to help someone else, as well.
</p>
<p>
On my newsletter side, I started it in 2017 as a way to more
consistently write and share. It’s turned into probably my most
important project I’ve taken on in my career, with several thousand
subscribers and an issue that comes out every week!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I usually write pretty off-the-cuff, and usually in Obsidian, my note
taking tool. I’ve actually written about my trying out
<a href="https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/trying-tinacms/">TinaCMS</a> and
how <a href="https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/publishing-from-obsidian/">I
publish from Obsidian</a>, as well! I also have a note of blog ideas if
I want to write something but I’m not sure how to get started.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I do think that physical space can influence you, and I love writing
under a blanket on the couch, ha! That being said, I think people can be
creative anywhere.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My day-to-day involves a lot of coding, meetings, and general writing. I
use:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a> (I still use vim on
occasion to maintain my street cred, but VS Code does what I need for
most things)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> (for all note-taking and
writing and blogging and remembering things)
</li>
<li>

things to read)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://cassidoo.github.io/todometer/">todometer</a> (for task
tracking)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.thesukha.co">Sukha</a> (for “flow state” work)
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://dabble.me/">Dabble.me</a> (for journaling)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a>
(<a href="https://cassidoo.co/newsletter">for my newsletter</a>)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I host my blog on <a href="https://netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, and it’s
an <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> website, and it’s
<a href="https://github.com/cassidoo/blahg">open source</a>
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Hmm, sometimes I wish I used something like Wordpress where I just write
and don’t think about how my blog is built. But at the same time, I like
being able to control easily all parts of my website and really own it!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My blog costs about $180 a year for the domain, analytics, and hosting.
My newsletter on top of that brings it up more, because that costs about
$140 a month. Luckily my newsletter brings in some sponsorship money to
offset the costs though. I say that if someone <em>can</em> make money
with the content they make, more power to them!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
<a href="https://www.eleanorkonik.com/">Eleanor Konik writes truly
fascinating things</a>.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’d love to share:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
My newsletter:
<a href="https://cassidoo.co/newsletter">cassidoo.co/newsletter</a>
</li>
<li>
My blog: <a href="https://blog.cassidoo.co">blog.cassidoo.co</a>

id="wikipedia-no-longer-considers-cnet-a-generally-reliable-source-after-ai-scandal">Wikipedia
no longer considers CNET a “generally reliable” source after “AI”
scandal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember last year, when we reported that the Red Ventures-owned
CNET had been quietly publishing dozens of AI-generated articles that
turned out to be filled with errors and plagiarism? The revelation
kicked off a fiery debate about the future of the media in the era of AI
— as well as an equally passionate discussion among editors of
Wikipedia, who needed to figure out how to treat CNET content going
forward. Gerard’s admonition was posted on January 18, 2023, just a few
days after our initial story about CNET‘s use of AI. The comment
launched a discussion that would ultimately result in CNET’s demotion
from its once-strong Wikipedia rating of “generally reliable.” It was a
grim fall that one former Red Ventures employee told us could “put a
huge dent in their SEO efforts,” and also a cautionary tale about the
wide-ranging reputational effects that publishers should consider before
moving into AI-generated content. ↫ Maggie Harrison Dupré Excellent
response by Wikipedia. Any outlet that uses spicy autocomplete to
generate content needs to be booted off Wikipedia.</p>

Pino will be adventuring a bit more north this summer, we’re planning to
explore the north coast of British Columbia, all the way to Prince
Rupert, or possibly Ketchikan(AK), areas with little to no cell

and winds are kind, and if we have time, we might go farther. We spend
our days studying charts, gathering supplies, and fixing up the boat to
make sure the passage is safe and pleasant. More updates on our plans
soon!

<h2 id="we-bought-a-house">We Bought a House</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: Jessica Smith’s blog</p>
<p>
Last year, Vivian and I bought a house.
</p>
<p>
I’ve mentioned it in passing on social media a few times, but my blog
post about it has lingered in draft purgatory for a long time. It’s a
difficult post to write because, obviously, I am painfully aware of how
privileged we are to even have been able to buy the house. Most couples
our age are really struggling with the inaffordability of housing in
this city, so it feels churlish to complain because we’ve done it. The
only reason this was <em>remotely</em> possible is because my
grandmother’s humble house that she lived in for 60 years appreciated to
some unfathomable sum thanks to our broken housing market, and my dad
and my uncle were willing to lend us their shares of the inheritance
which, in combination with my own share, was enough to buy this house.
So… I’m not going to do the asshole thing and exclaim, “If <em>we</em>
could afford a house in a ‘good’ Melbourne suburb on a single full-time
income, <em>anyone</em> can!” Obviously not. I know we’re very
fortunate.
</p>
<p>
And the house itself? Fundamentally, I do like it. It’s a 1930s house,
extremely close to a train station, with a big backyard and a
double-length garage. (Currently the garage is missing a wall because we
had to have the asbestos panels removed, but it still exists.) It has
lots of period charm. The problem is, it was in <em>terrible</em>
condition when we bought it: it was previously owned by a hoarder, and
had a big hole in the roof which had caused <em>extensive</em> damage
inside. It’s still not liveable yet, but we’ve made <em>substantial</em>
progress. The biggest outstanding job is getting the kitchen redone –
the existing one doesn’t have any counter space (???) – and then there’s
other stuff, like rebuilding that garage wall, repairs to windows,
painting, polishing floorboards, installing
<abbr title="air conditioning">AC</abbr>… but compare that list to the
list of stuff we already did (roof repairs, restumping, replacing rotten
floorboards, redoing the bathroom, replacing collapsed ceilings,
plastering up cracks in general…) and one is clearly a lot shorter than
the other. So, we continue.
</p>
<p>
While on the one hand I like the house, on the other hand, I feel like
this house has ruined my life. I was <em>super</em> wary of buying it,
both because of the huge amount of work required and because of the
amount of money we had to borrow (I know we borrowed from family, but
we’re still expected to <em>repay the loans</em>). I allowed myself to
be browbeaten into conceding, but I was completely correct on both
counts: it’s been <em>horrifically</em> stressful trying to organise all
these renovations, and the financial burden on us is <em>crippling</em>.
My mental health has been absolute trash over the last year, and while I
can’t say it’s 100% due to the house, I can’t help but feel it’s 90% due
to the house. Or at least, my baseline levels of anxiety and depressive
tendencies, which aren’t ideal but have mostly been manageable up until
now, have been completely overwhelmed by the misery instilled in me by
this house. I feel like my ability to feel any kind of enduring positive
emotion, like hope or satisfaction, has been extinguished. Instead I
feel trapped, shackled by these responsibilities, yearning for some kind
of escape. Last month, I finally sought out a mental health care plan,
because I have just not been coping. It’s not an overnight fix, but at
least it’s something. Honestly, I don’t think there’ll be any “fix”
until the renovations are finally <em>done</em> and the place is rented
out.
</p>
<p>
Oh yeah, rented out. Because the loans are so substantial that we have
no chance of even covering the <em>interest</em> (let alone paying down
the principal!) without rental income. We did <em>buy</em> it to be our
family home one day, and so that’s the standard we’re trying to do it up
to (we don’t want to be slumlords, you know?), but still, in the short
to medium-term we’ll have to be landlords. And I hate this. It’s causing
conflict between Viv and I, too, because he loves to crow about our
“investment property” thinking it makes him sound really cool and
important, while all <em>I</em> can think is that I let him browbeat me
into buying a home that was just that little bit too expensive for us
and now we can’t even afford to <em>live</em> in our own home. But
still, it’s not forever, right? As time goes on, the sum we borrowed
will become less and less in real terms, and also we have other elderly
relatives planning to leave us things, so <em>one day</em> we should be
able to afford to live in our own home. One day.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime… just gotta keep on keeping on. One day after another.
Get the works done, and move beyond the immediate crisis. Maybe then,
I’ll be able to see something positive in our purchase of this house.
What would be really nice is if one day – maybe when we can afford to
live there – I look back and realise it <em>really was</em> a worthwhile
investment, despite the short-term stress. After all, I do like the
house! It’s just so… much… work.

Journalist Held in Civil Contempt for Refusing to Divulge Source</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge held veteran investigative reporter
Catherine Herridge in civil contempt on Thursday for refusing to divulge
her source for a series of Fox News stories about a Chinese American
scientist who was investigated by the FBI but never charged.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington imposed a fine
of $800 per day until Herridge complies, but the fine will not go into
effect immediately to give her time to appeal.</p>
<p>Cooper wrote that he “recognizes the paramount importance of a free
press in our society” and the critical role of confidential sources in
investigative journalism. But the judge said the court “also has its own
role to play in upholding the law and safeguarding judicial
authority.”</p>
<p>“Herridge and many of her colleagues in the journalism community may
disagree with that decision and prefer that a different balance be
struck, but she is not permitted to flout a federal court’s order with
impunity,” wrote Cooper, who was nominated to the bench by former
President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Herridge, Patrick Philbin, declined to comment.
Representatives for CBS and Fox News did not immediately respond to
emails seeking comment.</p>
<p>The source is being sought by Yanpin Chen, who has sued the
government over the leak of details about the federal probe into
statements she made on immigration forms related to work on a Chinese
astronaut program.</p>
<p>Herridge, who was recently laid off by CBS News, published an
investigative series for Fox News in 2017 that examined Chen’s ties to
the Chinese military and raised questions about whether the scientist
was using a professional school she founded in Virginia to help the
Chinese government get information about American servicemembers.</p>
<p>The stories relied on what her lawyers contend were items leaked from
the probe, including snippets of an FBI document summarizing an
interview conducted during the investigation, personal photographs, and
information taken from her immigration and naturalization forms and from
an internal FBI PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p>Chen sued the FBI and Justice Department in 2018, saying her personal
information was selectively leaked to “smear her reputation and damage
her livelihood.”</p>
<p>The judge had ordered Herridge in August to answer questions about
her source or sources in a deposition with Chen’s lawyers. The judge
ruled that Chen’s need to know for the sake of her lawsuit overcomes
Herridge’s right to shield her source, despite the “vital importance of
a free press and the critical role” that confidential sources play in
journalists’ work.</p>
<p>Herridge was interviewed under oath in September by a lawyer for
Chen, but declined dozens of times to answer questions about her
sources, saying at one point, “My understanding is that the courts have
ruled that in order to seek further judicial review in this case, I must
now decline the order, and respectfully I am invoking my First Amendment
rights in declining to answer the question.”</p>
<p>Philbin, who served as deputy White House counsel during the Trump
administration, has said that forcing Herridge to turn over her sources
“would destroy her credibility and cripple her ability to play a role in
bringing important information to light for the public.”</p>
<p>Philbin also told the judge that disclosing the identity of
Herridge’s sources raises national security concerns, writing in court
papers that there is a “serious risk” that Chen “was involved in making
information about U.S. military members available” to the Chinese.</p>
<p>Legal fights over whether journalists should have to divulge sources
are rare, though they’ve arisen several times in the last couple decades
in Privacy Act cases like the one filed by Chen. Some lawsuits have
ended with a hefty Justice Department settlement in place of a
journalist being forced to reveal a source, an outcome that remains
possible in Herridge’s case.</p>
<p>In 2008, for instance, the Justice Department agreed to pay $5.8
million to settle a lawsuit by Army scientist Steven Hatfill, who was
falsely identified as a person of interest in the 2001 anthrax attacks.
That settlement resulted in a contempt order being vacated against a
journalist who was being asked to name her sources.</p>

<h2 id="career-us-diplomat-admits-spying-for-cuba-for-decades">Career US
Diplomat Admits Spying for Cuba for Decades</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MIAMI — A former career U.S. diplomat told a federal judge Thursday
he will plead guilty to charges of working for decades as a secret agent
for communist Cuba, an unexpectedly swift resolution to a case
prosecutors called one of the most brazen betrayals in the history of
the U.S. foreign service.</p>
<p>Manuel Rocha’s stunning fall from grace could culminate in a lengthy
prison term after the 73-year-old said he would admit to federal counts
of conspiring to act as an agent of a foreign government.</p>
<p>Prosecutors and Rocha’s attorney indicated the plea deal includes an
agreed-upon sentence, but they did not disclose details at a hearing
Thursday. He is due back in court April 12, when he is scheduled to
formalize his guilty plea and be sentenced.</p>
<p>“I am in agreement,” said Rocha, shackled at the hands and ankles,
when asked by U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom if he wished to
change his plea to guilty. Prosecutors, in exchange, agreed to drop 13
counts including wire fraud and making false statements.</p>
<p>The brief hearing shed no new light on the question that has proved
elusive since Rocha’s arrest in December: What exactly did he do to help
Cuba while working at the State Department for two decades? That
included stints as ambassador to Bolivia and top posts in Argentina,
Mexico, the White House and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.</p>
<p>“Ambassador Rocha,” as he preferred to be called, was well known
among Miami’s elite for his aristocratic, almost regal, bearing
befitting his Ivy League background. His post-government career included
time as a special adviser to the commander of the U.S. Southern Command
and more recently as a tough-talking Donald Trump supporter and Cuba
hardliner, a persona friends and prosecutors say Rocha adopted to hide
his true allegiances.</p>
<p>Peter Lapp, who oversaw FBI counterintelligence against Cuba between
1998 and 2005, said the fast resolution of the case benefits not only
the elderly Rocha but also the government, which stands to learn a lot
about Cuba’s penetration of U.S. foreign policy circles.</p>
<p>Typically in counterintelligence cases, the defendant is charged with
espionage. But Rocha was accused of the lesser crimes of acting as a
foreign agent, which carry maximum terms of between five and 10 years in
prison, making it easier for prosecutors and Rocha to reach an
agreement.</p>
<p>“It’s a win-win for both sides,” said Lapp, who led the investigation
into Ana Montes, the highest-level U.S. official ever convicted of
spying for Cuba. “He gets a significant payoff and the chance to see his
family again, and the U.S. will be able to conduct a full damage
assessment that it wouldn’t be able to do without his cooperation.” </p>
<p>But the abrupt deal drew criticism in the Cuban exile community, with
some legal observers worrying it amounted to a slap on the wrist.</p>
<p>“Any sentence that allows him to see the light of day again would not
be justice,” said Carlos Trujillo, a Miami attorney who served as U.S.
Ambassador to the Organization of American States during the Trump
administration. “He’s a spy for a foreign adversary who put American
lives at risk.”</p>
<p>A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.</p>

Leak Suspect Expected to Plead Guilty in Federal Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boston — Jack Teixeira, the Massachusetts Air National Guard member
accused of leaking highly classified military documents on a social
media platform, is expected to plead guilty in his federal case,
according to court papers filed Thursday. </p>
<p>Prosecutors asked the judge to schedule a change of plea hearing, but
no other details were immediately available. The judge set the hearing
for Monday in Boston’s federal courthouse. </p>
<p>Teixeira had previously pleaded not guilty to six counts of willful
retention and transmission of national defense information. Each count
is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. </p>
<p>The Massachusetts U.S. attorney’s office declined further comment. An
attorney for Teixeira didn’t immediately return a phone message
Thursday. </p>
<p>Teixeira, of North Dighton, Massachusetts, has been behind bars since
his April arrest for a leak that left the Biden administration
scrambling to assess and contain the damage among the international
community and reassure allies that its secrets are safe with the
U.S. </p>
<p>He was accused of sharing classified military documents about
Russia’s war in Ukraine and other sensitive national security topics on
Discord, a social media platform popular with people who play online
games. Investigators believe he led a private chat group called Thug
Shaker Central, where enthusiasts shared jokes, talked about their
favorite types of guns and discussed wars, including Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine. </p>
<p>Documents, photos</p>
<p>Authorities say Teixeira, who enlisted in the Air National Guard in
2019, began around January 2023 sharing military secrets with other
Discord users — first by typing out classified documents and then
sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings.
Teixeira worked as a “cyber transport systems specialist,” essentially
an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks. </p>
<p>Authorities have said that Teixeira was detected on April 6 — the day
The New York Times first published a story about the breach of documents
— searching for the word “leak” in a classified system. The FBI says
that was reason to believe Teixeira was trying to find information about
the investigation into who was responsible for the leaks. </p>
<p>Prosecutors say he continued to leak government secrets even after he
was warned by superiors about mishandling and improper viewing of
classified information. After being admonished by superiors, he was
again seen viewing information not related to his primary duty,
according to internal Air National Guard memos filed in court. </p>
<p>Authorities have provided few details about an alleged possible
motive, but accounts of those in the online private chat group where the
documents were disclosed have depicted Teixeira as motivated more by
bravado than ideology. </p>
<p>Prosecutors had urged the judge to keep Teixeira jailed while the
case played out, in part because of an arsenal of weapons found at his
home and his history of disturbing online statements. That included one
social media post saying that, if he had his way, he would like to kill
a “ton of people” because it would be “culling the weak minded.” </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani last year denied Teixeira’s bid
for release, saying, “No set of release conditions will reasonably
assure the safety of the community, or prevent destruction of
evidence.” </p>
<p>In pressing for their client to be freed from jail, Teixeira’s
attorneys pointed to the pretrial release of former President Donald
Trump and others in high-profile classified documents cases. Teixeira’s
lawyers noted that prosecutors did not seek to detain Trump — or his
co-defendant, Walt Nauta — even though they said the former president
and his valet “possess extraordinary means to flee the United
States.”</p>

<h2 id="first-us-moon-lander-in-50-years-goes-silent">First US Moon
Lander in 50 Years Goes Silent</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — The first U.S. spacecraft to land on the
moon since the Apollo astronauts fell silent Thursday, a week after
breaking a leg at touchdown and tipping over near the lunar south
pole.</p>
<p>Intuitive Machines’ lander, Odysseus, lasted longer than the company
anticipated after it ended up on its side with hobbled solar power and
communication.</p>
<p>The end came as flight controllers received one last photo from
Odysseus and commanded its computer and power systems to standby. That
way, the lander can wake up in another two to three weeks — if it
survives the bitterly cold lunar night.</p>
<p>Intuitive Machines spokesman Josh Marshall said these final steps
drained the lander’s batteries and put Odysseus “down for a long
nap.”</p>
<p>“Good night, Odie. We hope to hear from you again,” the company said
via X, formerly Twitter.</p>
<p>Before losing power, Odysseus sent back what Intuitive Machines
called “a fitting farewell transmission.”</p>
<p>Taken just before touchdown, the picture shows the bottom of the
lander on the moon’s pockmarked surface, with a tiny crescent Earth and
a small sun in the background.</p>
<p>The lander was originally intended to last about a week on the
moon.</p>
<p>Houston-based Intuitive Machines became the first private business to
land a spacecraft on the moon without crashing when Odysseus touched
down February 22. Only five countries had achieved that since the 1960s,
including Japan, which made a sideways landing last month.</p>
<p>Odysseus carried six experiments for NASA, which paid $118 million
for the ride. The first company to take part in NASA’s program for
commercial lunar deliveries never made it to the moon; its lander came
crashing back to Earth in January.</p>
<p>NASA views these private landers as scouts that will pave the way for
astronauts set to arrive in another few years.</p>
<p>Until Odysseus, the last U.S. moon landing was by Apollo 17’s Gene
Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972.</p>

announces super resolution DirectX API</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’re thrilled to announce DirectSR, our new API designed in
partnership with GPU hardware vendors to enable seamless integration of
Super Resolution (SR) into the next generation of games. Super
Resolution is a cutting-edge technique that increases the resolution and
visual quality in games. DirectSR is the missing link developers have
been waiting for when approaching SR integration, providing a smoother,
more efficient experience that scales across hardware. This API enables
multi-vendor SR through a common set of inputs and outputs, allowing a
single code path to activate a variety of solutions including NVIDIA
DLSS Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution, and Intel XeSS.
DirectSR will be available soon in the Agility SDK as a public preview,
which will enable developers to test it out and provide feedback. Don’t
miss our DirectX State of the Union at GDC to catch a sneak peek at how
DirectSR can be used with your games! ↫ Joshua Tucker at the DirectX

<h2 id="biden-knows-tariffs-wont-stop-chinese-evs">Biden Knows Tariffs
Won’t Stop Chinese EVs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTYwMzE4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NTM1NjQwOH0.BrSbcJLRDJTP12WjN4VaU-5xZZtMANw6yTXx3DB5vMg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
China’s car industry has been on a tear lately. Last year, China became
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-vehicle-sales-rise-further-boosted-by-stimulus-policies-sales-promotions-3452cca1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
world’s largest auto exporter</a>, and its home-grown carmaker BYD
recently eclipsed Tesla as the world’s No. 1 maker of electrified
vehicles.
</p>
<p>
If China were following a playbook first written by Japanese or Korean
automakers, you’d expect them to start selling their cars in the United
States pretty soon. But China — unlike Japan or South Korea — is not an
American ally, and so it’s going to have to follow a different path.
</p>
<p>
On Thursday, the Biden administration opened an investigation into the
national security risks posed by Chinese-made “connected vehicles,”
which essentially means any vehicle or any car part that connects to the
internet. New cars, especially EVs, are outfitted with cameras, sensors,
or cellular modems required for modern safety features.
</p>
<p>
The probe is the first part of what is likely to be a broad American
policy response to the rise of Chinese electric vehicles. “China’s
policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our
national security,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “I’m not
going to let that happen on my watch.”
</p>
<p>
The investigation is a big deal, in part because it marks that the
backlash to Chinese EVs has begun in earnest in the U.S. Look closely
and you’ll see Biden’s quote this morning gives away the game: Is the
risk that Chinese vehicles <em>flood the market, </em>or is the risk
that they’ll <em>harm national security</em>? For this administration,
one has the sense that it’s both.
</p>
<p>
In a press briefing with reporters, Commerce Secretary Gina Rainmondo,
whose office will lead the investigation, argued that these sensors and
computers could pose a risk to national security.
</p>
<p>
“Imagine if there were thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of Chinese
connected vehicles on American roads that could be immediately and
simultaneously disabled by somebody in Beijing,” she said. “It doesn’t
take a lot of imagination to figure out how a foreign adversary like
China with access to this sort of information at scale could pose a
serious risk for national security and the privacy of U.S. citizens.”
</p>
<p>
It was crucial to launch the investigation now, she added, before
Chinese-made vehicles became more prevalent on American roads. Today,
only a handful of brands — including Volvo, Polestar, and Buick — sell
Chinese-made vehicles in the United States, and no Chinese-originating
brand sells cars here.
</p>
<p>
There are three more things to observe about the sudden American action
against Chinese EVs.
</p>
<p>
First, the administration’s actions aren’t particularly surprising.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">As
I’ve previously written</a>, the rise of Chinese EVs poses an
existential threat to the legacy American automakers, including Ford and
General Motors. These companies employ four times more workers in
Michigan than in any other state, and Biden’s path to reelection runs
straight through Michigan this November.
</p>
<p>
And even though Biden’s climate agenda has been aggressively focused on
domestic development — you could argue that the Inflation Reduction Act
is as much about <em>national competitiveness </em>as <em>emissions
reductions, </em>per se<em> — </em>Donald Trump will claim no matter
what that Biden’s climate policy is a “job-killing” gift to China. So
Biden has to be especially certain that Chinese-made EVs don’t threaten
— can’t even <em>seem </em>like a threat — to the Michigan auto
industry.
</p>
<p>
Democrats, too, are not alone in calling for action against Chinese EV
makers. Republicans have already branded Biden’s pro-EV campaign as a
giveaway to China. On Wednesday, Senator Josh Hawley, a far-right
Missouri Republican,
<a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-new-bill-raise-tariffs-chinese-evs-protect-american-autoworkers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed
legislation</a> that would raise tariffs on Chinese EVs much higher than
their current level — to an astounding 125%. That would
<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2018/03/28/u-s-tariffs-vary-a-lot-but-the-highest-duties-tend-to-be-on-imported-clothing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exceed</a>
the highest tariff rates on the books, and it would also apply the
duties to Chinese-branded EVs made anywhere in the world, including in
countries that the U.S. has a free-trade agreement with.
</p>
<p>
Second, the investigation reflects just how difficult it will be for the
United States and China to keep from fighting over their highest quality
technological exports. Over the past few years, the U.S. has targeted or
restricted Huawei devices and the social network TikTok. China has
slapped rules on how Apple’s and Tesla’s products can be used.
</p>
<p>
At Heatmap, we have
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/china-economy-clean-energy-slowdown-evs" target="_self">written</a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/more-clean-energy-china-us-europe" target="_self">frequently</a>
about how the effort to deploy green technologies is becoming
inseparable from geopolitics. But this fight is over something much
broader than zero-carbon technologies — it’s potentially about digitized
products, anything with software, which includes electric vehicles and
batteries as well as smartphones and gadgets. If the American government
now believes that Chinese-made products with cameras or sensors risk
U.S. national security, then potentially a whole range of products —
robot vacuums, e-bikes, GPS watches, even home appliances — could pose
some sort of security risk. Electric vehicles may represent a
<em>greater </em>security risk, but the difference between them and,
say, phones is one of degrees and not kind.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the investigation reveals something that canny observers have
already noted: Tariffs alone probably can’t keep Chinese-branded EVs out
of the American market forever. BYD, the world’s No. 1 seller of
electrified vehicles, is planning to open a factory in Mexico; it
already sells its cars there. If BYD succeeds in establishing a North
American beachhead, then its cars could potentially fall under
U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement rules and freely enter the United
States. (The Hawley bill would theoretically circumvent this by applying
its tariffs to Chinese-branded vehicles wherever they are made. Whether
this would actually be worth the rift it would open with one of our most
important manufacturing partners is an open question.)
</p>
<p>
Those vehicles could rapidly become the most affordable new cars on the
road — if not in the United States itself, then in Mexico and Canada,
where American brands compete. BYD recently advertised an
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/663595/byd-seagull-ev-priced-11400-usd-gets-10000-orders-first-day/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$11,000
plug-in hybrid</a> targeted at the Chinese market. Even if meeting
American highway safety regulations added another $4,000 to that
vehicle’s cost, it would still be among the cheapest new cars sold in
this country. Even <em>doubling </em>its price with tariffs would keep
it firmly among the country’s most affordable new vehicles.
</p>
<p>
That <em>could</em> be good. Electric vehicles need to get cheaper
everywhere, including the U.S., if we are to fight climate change.
Likewise, the Commerce Department’s investigation could result in a
happy outcome, by which the national security and privacy risks of
Chinese EVs could be managed — through software, for instance — allowing
BYD or Polestar to sell some cars here without exposing Americans to
significant risk. But that’s not the the direction that I expect things
to take.

<h2 id="htmz-story">htmz story</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-01, from: Lean Rada’s blog</p>
<p>
This post is not the usual programming post. It’s been an interesting
week, I guess.
</p>
<p>
I just finished my mini side-project
<a target="_blank" href="https://leanrada.com/leanrada.com/htmz?ref=rss"><strong>htmz</strong></a>,
a snippet / library / microframework / whatever for HTML whose main
feature was that it only weighed a total of <strong>181 bytes</strong>.
It almost fits inside a single ‘tweet’ (wait, the limit is now 280 not
140?).
</p>
<p>
Here is the entire framework in its final form:
</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>iframe</span> <span>hidden</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span>htmz</span> <span><span>onload</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>=&gt;</span>
document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span>contentWindow<span>.</span>location<span>.</span>hash<span>||</span><span>null</span><span>)</span>
<span>?.</span><span>replaceWith</span><span>(</span><span>...</span>contentDocument<span>.</span>body<span>.</span>childNodes<span>)</span><span>)</span></span><span>"</span></span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>iframe</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>
See the
<a target="_blank" href="https://leanrada.com/leanrada.com/htmz?ref=rss">project
documentation</a> for more info on what it does.
</p>
<p>
I
<a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39429370">posted
it on Hacker News</a>, went to sleep because it was 3am at that point.
Then the next morning it was at the top of HN!
</p>
<p><img srcset="/notes/htmz-story/hn_585.generated.png 585w,/notes/htmz-story/hn_664.generated.png 664w" sizes="not (min-width:664px) 585px, 664px" alt="screenshot of HN.

<p>
I didn’t expect this at all. But naturally I rushed to the comments
section which quickly grew too numerous for me to read. They were
generally positive, and acknowledged the project’s hackyness and
elegance (these adjectives usually mean opposite things). It was pretty
cool! The top comment in the thread sums it up.
</p>
<p>
A bunch of common themes were raised. I guess I’ll write about them in
this post.
</p>
<h2 id="why-htmz">
Why htmz?
</h2>
<p>
htmz was initially inspired by
<a target="_blank" href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>, another web
library/framework. One of htmx’s main features was that it provides the
capability for any element, not just the entire window, to be the target
for update by an HTTP request (e.g. by clicking a link you load a
partial HTML update to the page).
</p>
<p><img srcset="/notes/htmz-story/htmx_573.generated.png 573w,/notes/htmz-story/htmx_664.generated.png 664w" sizes="not (min-width:664px) 573px, 664px" alt="Why should you only be able to replace the entire screen? By removing these constraints, htmx completes HTML as a hypertext." src="https://leanrada.com/notes/htmz-story/htmx.png?ref=rss" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" height=""></p>
<p>
I wondered for a bit then remembered that we already have
<strong>iframes</strong>, a native HTML way for links to update not just
the entire window, but a ‘part’ of the page. Granted, iframes are
limited and not as dynamic as some of htmx’s operations like appends and
deletions.
</p>
<p>
So I set out to make an iframe-only solution to this class of problems.
htmz initially stood for <strong>‘htmx zero’</strong> or something like
that, because you need exactly zero JavaScript to be able to use
iframes, while htmx stood at around 16 kB compressed (decompresses to a
total of 48 kB of JavaScript!). Minimising the amount of code needed was
the primary goal from the start.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, the original iframe solution evolved to support most of the
usual operations like deletions, and a <em>bit</em> of JS was required
after all. htmz was then backronymised as <em><b>H</b>tml with
<b>T</b>argeted <b>M</b>anipulation <b>Z</b>ones</em>.
</p>
<h2 id="was-it-a-joke">
Was it a joke?
</h2>
<p>
<em>(short answer: maybe)</em>
</p>
<p>
Starting with the name itself, htmz sounded like a parody of the more
popular htmx. I thought it was obvious that this project was just a fun
hack to share.
</p>
<p>
But some people took it too seriously. I know, this is HN, where serious
startups and stuff are posted daily. Or rather, this is the Internet.
</p>
<p>
I was reminded of
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law">Poe’s
law</a>. On the other hand, the initial documentation for the project
did give mixed vibes (it was a half-joke half-solution project after
all). And the marketing bits were too good for the project’s own good.
</p>
<img srcset="/notes/htmz-story/logo_200.generated.png 200w,/notes/htmz-story/logo_664.generated.png 664w" sizes="not (min-width:664px) 200px, 664px" alt="" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/htmz-story/logo.png?ref=rss" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" height="">
<span>This project has a favicon while htmx.org has none. Marketing
overload! But really, I just enjoy polishing the little details in
projects.</span>
<p>
Orrr maybe I’m the only one who finds humour in a section called
‘Installing’ that, instead of telling you to install a package, tells
you to simply copy a snippet. Orrr what about when ‘Extensions’ are not
plugins but code you actually have to write yourself… Ha! Get it? 😂😂😂
Subversion of expectations, anyone? No? OK, fine…
</p>
<p>
In any case, I had my fun writing these aspects of the project!
</p>
<p>
I made an npm package for good measure:
</p>
<p><img srcset="/notes/htmz-story/npm_597.generated.png 597w,/notes/htmz-story/npm_664.generated.png 664w" sizes="not (min-width:664px) 597px, 664px" alt="For npm enjoyers, use the following npm commands to automate the simple process of copying the snippet. For maximum npm enjoyment, this npm package contains 25 bonus dependencies!" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/htmz-story/npm.png?ref=rss" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" height=""></p>
<h2 id="code-golfing">
Code golfing
</h2>
<p>
Some commenters pointed out insights which led to significant reductions
in the size of the snippet. Some even made pull requests, that I
reviewed and merged (Am I an ‘open-source maintainer’ yet?).
</p>
<p>
My initial release started with <strong>181</strong> bytes:
</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>iframe</span> <span>hidden</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span>htmz</span> <span><span>onload</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>=&gt;</span>
document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>contentWindow<span>.</span>location<span>.</span>hash<span>||</span><span>':not(*)'</span><span>)</span>
<span>?.</span><span>replaceWith</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>contentDocument<span>.</span>body<span>.</span>childNodes<span>)</span><span>)</span></span><span>"</span></span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>iframe</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>
Turns out <code>’:not(*)’</code> is <em>not</em> necessary as a selector
fallback. <code>querySelector</code> can accept null! Down to
<strong>176</strong> bytes:
</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>iframe</span> <span>hidden</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span>htmz</span> <span><span>onload</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>=&gt;</span>
document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>contentWindow<span>.</span>location<span>.</span>hash<span>||</span><span>null</span><span>)</span>
<span>?.</span><span>replaceWith</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>this</span><span>.</span>contentDocument<span>.</span>body<span>.</span>childNodes<span>)</span><span>)</span></span><span>"</span></span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>iframe</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>
Apparently, <code>this</code> is also unnecessary within inline
attribute scripts when referring to the element it’s attached to. Now
down to <strong>166</strong> bytes (its final form as of today):
</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>iframe</span> <span>hidden</span> <span>name</span><span><span>=</span>htmz</span> <span><span>onload</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>=&gt;</span>
document<span>.</span><span>querySelector</span><span>(</span>contentWindow<span>.</span>location<span>.</span>hash<span>||</span><span>null</span><span>)</span>
<span>?.</span><span>replaceWith</span><span>(</span><span>...</span>contentDocument<span>.</span>body<span>.</span>childNodes<span>)</span><span>)</span></span><span>"</span></span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>iframe</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>
That’s about 90% of the original! I’m pretty sure this could be reduced
further (<code>setTimeout</code> isn’t strictly required) but I’m
leaving it as it is. This code golfing diversion has been fun and I
learned about HTML spec stuff that I wouldn’t normally discover in my
day job as a React framework user.
</p>
<h2 id="knowledge-sharing">
Knowledge sharing
</h2>
<p>
Some commenters shared similar approaches and techniques. Some tips /
workarounds on how to best utilise the snippet were thrown around. There
were even discussions in the project’s Issue tracker on GitHub.
</p>
<p>
<span>For one, the new
<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Sec-Fetch-Dest">Sec-Fetch-Dest</a>
header that someone mentioned is pretty cool. It lets the server know if
the request is for an iframe or for a new tab, etc. Pretty handy for
<em>hypertext</em> servers!</span>
</p>
<p>
I learned lots and, not wanting to get these learnings lost into the
archives, incorporated these tips into the main documentation, into the
examples/demos, and some even became real-ish
<a target="_blank" href="https://leanrada.com/leanrada.com/htmz/extensions?ref=rss">extensions</a>:
</p>
<p><img srcset="/notes/htmz-story/extensions_621.generated.png 621w,/notes/htmz-story/extensions_664.generated.png 664w" sizes="not (min-width:664px) 621px, 664px" alt="Screenshot of the Extensions page" src="https://leanrada.com/notes/htmz-story/extensions.png?ref=rss" spec="100% [664) 664" loading="lazy" width="100%" height=""></p>
<p>
It’s a multi-way exchange. htmz and its iframe shenanigans have
apparently inspired the creation of new HTML frameworks, such as
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/joeldrapper/morphlex">morphlex</a>
and
<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/callionica/htmf">htmf</a>. I
also saw people taking the idea into different directions, like using
<a target="_blank" href="https://zenn.dev/kawarimidoll/articles/33316cf9caa465">iframes
to lazy-load HTML partials</a>. I feel happy about having inspired
people! There are even some who said so via the
<a target="_self" href="https://leanrada.com/guestbook?ref=rss">guestbook</a>,
which was especially nice!
</p>
<h2 id="future">
Future
</h2>
<p>
I think the htmz story is done and I’m already looking forward to my
next project (the 7DRL challenge). It’s still getting some mentions in
blogs, podcasts, here and there, but it’s not like I’m gonna turn this
into some serious full-time open-source project with versions and
releases and (lack of) funds and all that jazz.
</p>
<p>
GitHub activity (stars, issues, PRs) have slowed down as well. There’s
not much you can work with 166 characters, after all.
</p>
<p>
But the idea lives on; may the snippet proliferate! :D

While I believe Tesla’s move to open its Supercharger network to other
automakers is ultimately going to have a great impact on EV adoption, it
is also a smart business move from Tesla.

<h2 id="for-some-chinese-migrants-few-options-in-xis-china">For Some
Chinese Migrants, Few Options in Xi’s China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lajas Blancas, Panama / Washington — With only a backpack, a portable
tent and a small shoulder bag, Cong, a 47-year-old Chinese migrant, was
one of more than a dozen migrants to step out of a narrow wooden boat on
the stony shore of the Chucunaque River in Lajas Blancas, Panama.</p>
<p>The stop was one of dozens he had made over the past month, and it
was where he met with VOA’s Mandarin Service on his journey toward the
United States — a journey that began in China’s southwestern province of
Sichuan. Cong declined to provide his full name, citing security
concerns.</p>
<p>As he walked across the shore under the hot sun, wearing a
long-sleeved black T-shirt, black sports shorts and white Croc-like
slippers, he limped slightly from a swollen ankle caused by a slip while
crossing a river earlier in his journey.</p>
<p>Immigrants from China are the fastest-growing group of people making
the long journey to the U.S. border. Navigating Panama’s treacherous
Darien Gap, and risking death and disease, is a key part of that
journey.</p>
<p>Like many others, Cong says he got a lot of information from online
sources about how to make the trek, including Douyin, the Chinese
version of TikTok. After half a year of planning, he decided, “I must
go.”</p>
<p>“When I came out, I decided it’s going to be worth it, even if I die
on the way,” he said.</p>
<p>When VOA asked the former crepe store owner why he traveled thousands
of miles to a country he had never visited before, he replied,
“Freedom.”</p>
<p>“I want freedom,” he said.</p>
<p>Cong said there is no freedom in China, which made him depressed. He
said his Douyin account had been banned several times for using
sensitive keywords and criticizing Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Cong said his definition of freedom is that he doesn’t have to do
what he doesn’t want to do, and that he can criticize the president.</p>
<p>China’s sluggish economy was another big reason why he decided to
leave the country. Its stock market is at a five-year low, and the
country has seen a decline in exports and imports. Last June, Cong had
to close his crepe store for lack of customers.</p>
<p>“No one has money. There is no easy business,” he said. “Without
foreign trade, it’s all domestic money changing hands. How can that
create wealth?”</p>
<p>Cong is not alone in making the decision to make the trek to the U.S.
border.</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that more than 37,000
Chinese migrants were detained at the U.S-Mexico border in 2023, nearly
10 times more than the previous year.</p>
<p>In the San Diego sector alone — stretching 100 kilometers inland from
the Pacific Ocean — U.S. Border Patrol officials told a local television
station this week they have made more than 140,000 arrests since October
1. They included about 20,000 people from China, a 500% increase over
the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>After crossing the border, the migrants surrender to the Border
Patrol and declare their intention to seek asylum in the United States.
They are processed and are often released within 72 hours. According to
the Department of Justice, 55% of Chinese migrants were granted asylum
last year.</p>
<p>Giuseppe Loprete, head of mission in Panama for the International
Organization for Migration, a United Nations body that provides
information for migrants crossing the Darien Gap, told Al Jazeera in an
interview that the Chinese migrants are particularly vulnerable due to
the language barrier and a perception that they are wealthy.</p>
<p>Cong said he paid $700 to a tour guide he found on the Chinese social
media platform WeChat for instructions to get to Acandí, Colombia. From
there, he walked for three days in the rain forest. He paid another $25
for the boat ride on the Chucunaque River. But that is only a fraction
of the expenses he has incurred on his journey of more than a month from
Sichuan through Thailand, Turkey, Ecuador, Colombia and now Panama.</p>
<p>The number of individuals leaving China has surged since Xi took
office in 2013. According to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR,
more than 700,000 Chinese sought asylum overseas between 2013 and 2021.
That included more than 100,000 each year between 2019 and 2021, the
last year for which UNHCR statistics are available.</p>
<p>The dramatic rise in Chinese migrants coming to the U.S. has raised
national security concerns in America, with some questioning whether
there are Chinese spies among them.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Mark Green, chair of the House Homeland
Security Committee, sounded an alarm about the wave of Chinese migrants
entering the United States last June, claiming the majority are
military-age men with known ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
and the People’s Liberation Army.</p>
<p>Green and fellow Republicans Senator Marco Rubio and Representative
Troy E. Nehls introduced the No Asylum for CCP Spies Act last year,
which if passed, would prevent CCP members from seeking asylum in the
U.S.</p>
<p>Border patrol agents encountered 5,717 single Chinese adults in
January, more than twice as many as in any other January on record, CBP
data shows. In December, that figure hit a record high of 7,581, while
the total since January 2023 now stands at 64,979.</p>
<p>VOA Mandarin observed more Chinese men than women traveling
alone.</p>
<p>With several thousand kilometers to go on his journey, Cong says few
things are certain. He says he hopes to begin life in the U.S. by
washing dishes in a restaurant after arriving at his final
destination.</p>
<p>“Better to do all you can rather than floating along helplessly,” he
said.</p>

id="with-back-to-back-actions-biden-spotlights-china-data-security-threat">With
Back-to-Back Actions, Biden Spotlights China Data Security Threat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration launched a series of actions
against China in recent days, sustaining pressure against the United
States’ key strategic rival even as it focuses on more urgent fronts,
including the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.</p>
<p>In the span of one week, the administration announced an executive
order to protect Americans’ personal data from foreign adversaries,
including China; launched an investigation into potential security
threats posed by connected vehicles that use Chinese technology; and
placed sanctions on Chinese entities for supporting Moscow’s invasion of
Ukraine.</p>
<p>The actions taken by President Joe Biden stand in contrast to the
months of warming ties following a November summit in California between
him and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping — a meeting aimed to improve
a bilateral relationship that had reached its lowest point in decades
due to rivalry and mistrust.</p>
<p>Since the summit, diplomatic engagement has increased from both
sides, including the resumption of military-to-military talks that were
frozen after former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 2022 visit to
Taiwan.</p>
<p>Restarting staff-level talks in early January was key to ensuring
that the two sides avoided a major cross-strait incident during Taiwan’s
election later in the month.</p>
<p>In January, Washington and Beijing also launched a working group
designed to crack down on the flow of Chinese precursors used in the
production of fentanyl and other synthetic drugs sold in the U.S.,
another sign of cooperation between the superpowers.</p>
<p>Ties improved to the point that Beijing marked the 45th anniversary
of U.S.-China diplomatic relations in January with a lavish banquet,
where Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi promised that Chinese giant
pandas, much loved by American zoo visitors, will return to U.S. by the
end of the year.</p>
<p>So why the flurry of actions against China now?</p>
<p>National security issue</p>
<p>The White House sidestepped questions on the back-to-back timing of
the measures.</p>
<p>Biden is “concerned about countries like China,” White House deputy
press secretary Olivia Dalton said to reporters aboard Air Force One on
Thursday.</p>
<p>“China is right now looking to flood the market here in the United
States and around the world with vehicles equipped with advanced
technology from countries of concern,” she said. “That’s a national
security issue that we take very seriously.”</p>
<p>An administration official told reporters during a briefing that the
U.S. Commerce Department probe launched Thursday to ensure that Chinese
cars driving on American roads do not undermine U.S. national security,
is “complementary and distinct” from the executive order to protect
Americans’ personal data from China and other foreign adversaries. The
latter order blocks bulk transfers of data such as geolocation,
biometric, health and financial information to “countries of
concern.”</p>
<p>By putting the two announcements next to each other, the
administration is trying to communicate that they’re taking data
security seriously, said Emily Benson, director of the Project on Trade
and Technology at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies.</p>
<p>“The anticipated outcome there was to signal that the connected
vehicle rules are actually a national security instrument,” Benson told
VOA.</p>
<p>The U.S. plans to engage partners and allies following the
investigation into the threat posed by Chinese vehicles. There’s a
“growing sense of the security risks” and “really strong interest in the
measures that we might take and the results of the investigation,” an
administration official told VOA during a briefing Wednesday.</p>
<p>Biden himself warned of the dangers.</p>
<p>“Connected vehicles from China could collect sensitive data about our
citizens and our infrastructure and send this data back to the People’s
Republic of China,” the president said in a statement.</p>
<p>National security concerns aside, the administration is also
anticipating an overcapacity of more affordable Chinese vehicles
entering the American marketplace, especially as Chinese auto producers
such as BYD set up manufacturing facilities in Mexico that would afford
them more favorable tariff rates under USMCA, the free-trade agreement
between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.</p>
<p>“That has created a lot of fear in Washington about the longevity of
the U.S. automobile sector,” Benson said.</p>
<p>She added that the executive actions taken this week are “easier and
more appropriate” than the effort to ban TikTok. The social media app is
used by more than 100 million Americans despite allegations that its
China-based parent company, ByteDance, could collect sensitive user
data.</p>
<p>While the federal government and dozens of individual states have
barred TikTok from government devices, Congress has yet to enact
legislation to ban Americans from using the application on their
personal devices.</p>
<p>The app is highly popular, especially among young people, prompting
Biden’s campaign to join the platform despite the administration’s
previously firm stance on its potential national security concerns.</p>
<p>Balanced approach</p>
<p>As Biden gears up for his reelection campaign, his administration is
keen to project the image that they are taking the threat of China
seriously, said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson
Center.</p>
<p>“Balancing has always been the theme of his policy,” Sun told VOA.
“When there is positive engagement, there’s also the punitive
gestures.”</p>
<p>Without such gestures, the administration would be vulnerable to
criticism that it is ignoring the fact that Beijing remains a source of
significant national security challenges for the United States, she
said.</p>
<p>“The administration has to demonstrate that it is extremely
clear-eyed about the limitation of engagement but also the desirability
of the engagement,” she said. “Engagement does not mean there’s no
problem.”</p>
<p>Washington also announced sanctions against Chinese firms last week
as part of a measure marking the second anniversary of Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine. The trade penalties targeted entities in Russia and in
countries viewed by the administration as supporting Moscow’s war
effort.</p>
<p>The actions against China followed a meeting between Wang and U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the sidelines of the Munich
Security Conference earlier in February.</p>
<p>In the meeting, Wang warned Blinken that turning de-risking “into
‘de-China,’ building ‘small courtyards and high walls,’ and engaging in
‘decoupling from China’ will eventually backfire on the United
States.”</p>

House: Civil Liberties Decline Globally for 18th Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Civil liberties declined globally for the 18th
consecutive year in 2023, with conflict and flawed elections the biggest
factors, a new report has found.  </p>
<p>Political rights and civil liberties deteriorated for more than
one-fifth of the population, the non-profit group Freedom House found.
And only one-fifth of the 210 countries and territories the research
group analyzed was found to be “free.” </p>
<p>Released on Thursday, the Freedom in the World report assesses
political rights and civil liberties, then ranks countries or
territories as “free,” “partly free,” or “not free.”  </p>
<p>Researchers looked at issues including how effectively governments
work, political pluralism, freedom of expression, religious freedom, and
whether marginalized groups are given full rights.  </p>
<p>Much of the decline in 2023 is attributed to cases of election
manipulation, according to report co-author Cathryn Grothe. The report
found electoral issues in almost half of the countries designated as
being in decline.  </p>
<p>“While the findings of the report are certainly grim, they are coming
at an especially important moment in time,” said Grothe, noting 2024
will be a critical year with national elections scheduled in about 40
countries.  </p>
<p>Report finds manipulation, intimidation</p>
<p>Grothe told VOA her group’s research found widespread election
manipulation and intimidation before, during and after elections.  </p>
<p>She noted that “billions of people around the world are going to be
heading to the polls.”  </p>
<p>The report highlighted Cambodia, Guatemala, Poland, Turkey and
Zimbabwe as places that experienced attempts to control, hinder or
interfere with elections. </p>
<p>And in Ecuador, Nigeria, and Taiwan, elections were disrupted by
either violence or interference by foreign regimes.  </p>
<p>In Guatemala, however, attempts to block a peaceful transfer of power
failed. Bernardo Arevalo assumed office in early 2024 after the
country’s Supreme Court ruled that Congress must accept his
inauguration, despite its previous refusal to acknowledge elected
members.  </p>
<p>Group watches US races</p>
<p>The United States — which Freedom House ranks as free — is among the
countries holding significant elections.  </p>
<p>Grothe said that Freedom House is paying attention to issues in the
U.S., including congressional dysfunction such as delayed appropriations
bills and internal disputes over the speakership of the House of
Representatives.  </p>
<p>Freedom House is also watching closely for intimidation and threats
of violence as tools of political influence in the U.S, especially
during the last few months before the election.  </p>
<p>Reports of threats against elected officials and local election
administrators have “proliferated”in recent years, Grothe said. </p>
<p>“When a democracy such as the U.S., those with kind of large
influence on the world stage grow weaker internally, it makes it a lot
more difficult to counter this kind of global authoritarianism,” said
Grothe. “It makes it very imperative that we at home in the United
States need to address our own domestic shortcomings.” </p>
<p>The Freedom House report includes several recommendations, including
calls for governments and other actors in civil society to “immediately”
and “publicly” condemn manipulation efforts, coups and refusals to honor
electoral outcomes.</p>
<p>“Democracies need to commit to free and fair elections, both at home
and need to stand up for the same abroad,” said Grothe. </p>
<p>The biggest decline in freedom was registered in Nagorno-Karabakh, a
disputed territory which sparked conflict between Azerbaijan and
Armenia. </p>
<p>The region saw an overall 40-point reduction. The decline follows a
mass displacement of over 100,000 ethnic Armenians amid fighting in
September 2023. </p>
<p>The second-largest point reduction came in Niger, where military
forces ousted the government in July 2023.  </p>
<p>Conflict resulted in major declines in other areas too. Russia’s war
in Ukraine continues to affect basic rights for those in occupied parts
of Ukraine and brings a rise in repression inside Russia. The report
also notes the effect on civilians of the Israel-Hamas conflict and
Myanmar military rule. </p>
<p>Other countries saw improvements. Fiji gained seven points due to a
“smooth” transfer of power after elections in 2022. And Nepal is
recognized in the report for amendments to its Citizenship Act, which
allowed 400,000 stateless people born in the country to receive
citizenship.  </p>
<p>While the past year faced obstacles, Grothe said there are “beacons
of hope” in the countries pushing back against those declines.  </p>
<p>“It’s important to remember that people in every sort of political
environment, from the most-free countries to the most repressive, are
continuing to fight to uphold their rights, their dignity and this
offers some kind of level of hope even in these very kind of
discouraging times.” </p>
<p>She added that the report should serve as a reminder of the stakes
for democracy and as a call to reverse the decline of global
freedoms.</p>

Induction stoves are a great, safe way to save on electricity costs and
can heat much quicker, safer, and more accurately than natural gas or
propane stoves. But a new breed of these stoves includes huge batteries,
which opens up new opportunities by only requiring a 120V outlet,
offering 40-sec water boiling, backup power to other appliances like the
refrigerator, and even IRA tax rebates. Let’s take a look at two of
these new models and try to understand if it makes sense for an oven to
have a huge battery over a more centralized Powerwall type of home
backup battery.

<h2 id="congress-approves-short-term-funding-to-avoid-shutdown">Congress
Approves Short-Term Funding to Avoid Shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Congress passed another short-term spending measure
Thursday that would keep one set of federal agencies operating through
March 8 and another set through March 22, avoiding a shutdown for parts
of the federal government that would otherwise kick in Saturday. The
bill now goes to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.</p>
<p>The short-term extension is the fourth in recent months, and many
lawmakers expect it to be the last for the fiscal year. House Speaker
Mike Johnson said negotiators had completed six of the annual spending
bills that fund federal agencies and had “almost final agreement on the
others.”</p>
<p>“We’ll get the job done,” Johnson said as he exited a closed-door
meeting with Republican colleagues.</p>
<p>The House acted first Thursday. The vote to approve the extension was
320-99. It easily cleared the two-thirds majority needed for passage.
Democrats overwhelmingly voted to avert a partial shutdown. But the vote
was much more divided with Republicans, 113 in support and 97
against.</p>
<p>The Senate then took up the bill and approved it during an evening
vote of 77-13.</p>
<p>“When we pass this bill, we will have, thank God, avoided a shutdown
with all its harmful effects on the American people,” Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer said moments before the vote.</p>
<p>Next week, the House and Senate are expected to take up a package of
six spending bills and get them to the president before March 8. Then,
lawmakers would work to fund the rest of the government by the new March
22 deadline.</p>
<p>At the end of the process, Congress is expected to have approved more
than $1.6 trillion in spending for the fiscal year that began October 1.
That amount is roughly in line with the previous fiscal year and is what
former Speaker Kevin McCarthy negotiated with the White House last year
before eight disgruntled Republican lawmakers joined with Democrats a
few months later and voted to oust him from the position.</p>
<p>Some of the House’s most conservative members wanted deeper cuts for
non-defense programs than that agreement allowed through its spending
caps. They also sought an array of policy changes that Democrats
opposed. They were hoping the prospect of a shutdown could leverage more
concessions.</p>
<p>Republican leadership said that the broader funding legislation being
teed up for votes in March would lead to spending cuts for many
nondefense agencies. By dividing the spending bill into chunks, they are
hoping to avoid an omnibus bill — a massive, all-encompassing bill that
lawmakers generally had little time to digest or understand before
voting on it. Republicans vowed there would be no omnibus this time.</p>
<p>“When you take away Defense and Veterans Affairs, the rest of the
agencies are going to be seeing spending cuts in many cases,” said House
Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La. “There are also some policy changes
that we pushed through the House that will be in the final product. Of
course, some of those are still being negotiated.”</p>
<p>The temporary extension funds the departments of Agriculture,
Transportation, Interior and others through March 8. It funds the
Pentagon, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services and the State
Department through March 22.</p>
<p>While congressional leaders have said they’ve reached final agreement
on what will be in the first package of spending bills voted on next
week, there’s still room for an impasse on the second package to be
voted on later in the month.</p>
<p>The renewed focus on this year’s spending bills doesn’t include the
separate, $95.3 billion aid package that the Senate approved for
Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan earlier this month, with much of that money
being spent in the U.S. to replenish America’s military arsenal. The
bill also contained about $9 billion in humanitarian assistance for
civilians in Gaza and the West Bank, Ukraine and other war zones.</p>
<p>Democrats urged quicker action on Ukraine as the temporary spending
bill was debated.</p>
<p>“Without swift action, the legacy of this Congress will be the
destruction of Ukraine, the appeasement of a dictator, and the
abandonment of starving children and ailing families,” said Rep. Rosa
DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee.</p>

<h2 id="its-groundhog-day-for-new-yorks-offshore-wind-industry">It’s
Groundhog Day for New York’s Offshore Wind Industry</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTYwNjQ5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NzIxNjY2N30.pq1ZG4kFF2ryDTm2J7Q2XxJNNhiq8hIN8GWG0DBkC6w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
New York’s offshore wind industry is back, or at least
<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-two-offshore-wind-project-awards-deliver-clean-power-2026" target="_blank">back
in contract</a>. Two offshore wind projects, Empire Wind 1 and Sunrise
Wind, were awarded, respectively, to developers Equinor and the
partnership of Orsted and Eversource. These two projects, which would
amount to 1,700 megawatts of capacity in total (enough to power about a
million homes, according to Governor Kathy Hochul’s office), had
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-new-york-public-service-commission" target="_blank">first
been bid out in 2019</a> and then rebid when <em>these same
developers</em> were unable to renegotiate their contracts to deal with
rising material and interest rate costs.
</p>
<p>
Last year was an
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-two-offshore-wind" target="_blank"><em>annus
horribilis</em> for the offshore wind industry</a>,
with<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-power-cost-expensive" target="_self">
projects cancelled</a> up and down the East Coast and billions of
dollars of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/orsted-earnings-bad-us-2023" target="_self">losses</a>
for offshore wind developers. The delayed and cancelled projects have
called into question the viability of the Biden administration’s
ambitious goal of installing 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
</p>
<p>
This year, however, has seen some signs of recovery. For years, the U.S.
offshore wind industry was a bunch of plans and a few dozen megawatts of
capacity from wind farms off the coasts of Rhode Island and Virginia.
Then came Vineyard Wind 1,
<a href="https://www.vineyardwind.com/press-releases/2024/1/3/cip-avangrid-announce-first-power-from-nation-leading-vineyard-wind-1-project" target="_blank">off
the coast of Massachusetts</a>, which started delivering power early
this year, shortly after another New York project, South Fork Wind,
started up in
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/27/south-fork-us-first-complete-utility-scale-wind-farm/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">December
of last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
But merely (re-)awarding the contracts does not ensure that steel goes
into the water, let alone that electrons flow into homes. Sunrise Wind
will likely be completed in 2026, according to Orsted. Before that the
Danish company has to hammer out the details of a new contract, and only
then finally decide whether to go through with the thing or not; that’s
expected to happen sometime in the second quarter of this year, with
federal permitting finished in the summer. Empire Wind 1 has a similar
timelin<del>e</del>.
</p>
<p>
According to the governor’s office, utility customers will feel these
contracts to the tune of an extra $2 a month. When the projects were
first bid out in 2019, the expected impact on utility bills was just
$0.73.

<h2 id="how-to-get-on-a-podcast">How to get on a podcast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
I’ve been co-hosting <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com/">a weekly
podcast</a> for nearly 12 years with over hundreds of guests and I want
to tell you the secret to getting invited on a podcast. Are you ready?
Here it goes.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Already be talking about something.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to go on a podcast and talk, the best thing you can do is
already be talking about something. And by talking, I don’t mean
pontificating on social media. I mean by writing blog posts, responding
to comments, participating in web standards, doing conference/meetup
talks, and having actual human-to-human interactions (in-person or
online) where you’re taking place in the marketplace of ideas. It helps
if you do that on a regular cadence. If I can see from the outside that
you’re thinking about a topic –whether broadly or deeply– that gives you
standout guest potential. You don’t need to have a whole branded “A Book
Apart”-style catch phrase for what you’re talking about (although, it
doesn’t hurt), but you need to show you’ve thought about, experimented
with, or understand a topic beyond the <code>readme.md</code>.
</p>
<p>
The incentive structure is setup like this (presented in user story
format):
</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<div class="highlight">
<pre class="highlight"><code>AS A podcast host
I WANT a friendly and knowledgeable guest
SO THAT I can fill an hour of dead air
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>
As a podcast host, I need as close to a “sure thing” as possible. Being
a good guest candidate also requires a lot of soft skills. Possessing
knowledge is one thing, but I need the confidence that we can talk a for
an hour without you being an asshole or the conversation collapsing. Are
you funny? Serious? Either way can you spin a story and be remotely
relatable? A nightmare scenario for me is having to throw away a whole
episode and scramble to record a backup before the show goes out on
Monday. Whatever you can do to model those core skills in your online
persona goes a long way.
</p>
<p>
Anyways. That’s my advice if being a guest on a podcast or livestream is
a goal of yours. It probably works for speaking at conferences too. I
don’t care if you’re someone’s boss, if you’re super-duper smart, if you
drive a Porsche, if you have a popular code repository, or if you’ve
paid to get yourself into a Forbes article. My biggest care is that
you’re already talking about something, you have an open catalog of
thoughts and opinions, and I can see evidence that your ideas have
broader appeal than your basement.

id="artificial-intelligence-is-game-changer-for-election-interference-fbi-warns">Artificial
Intelligence Is Game Changer for Election Interference, FBI Warns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. security officials are bracing for an onslaught of
fast-paced influence operations, from a wide range of adversaries, aimed
at impacting the country’s coming presidential election.</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray issued the latest warning about
attempts to meddle with American voters as they decide whom to support
when they go to the polls come November, telling a meeting of security
professional Thursday that technologies such as artificial intelligence
are already altering the threat landscape.</p>
<p>“This election cycle, the U.S. will face more adversaries moving at a
faster pace and enabled by new technology,” Wray said.</p>
<p>“Advances in generative AI [artificial intelligence], for instance,
are lowering the barrier to entry, making it easier for both more and
less sophisticated foreign adversaries to engage in malign influence
while making foreign influence efforts by players both old and new, more
realistic and more difficult to detect,” he said.</p>
<p>The warning echoes concerns raised earlier in the week by a top
lawmaker and by the White House, both singling out Russia.</p>
<p>“I worry that we are less prepared for foreign intervention in our
elections in 2024 than we were in 2020,” said Mark Warner, the chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee, during a cybersecurity conference
on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Sunday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told
NBC’s “Meet the Press” there is “plenty of reason to be concerned.”</p>
<p>“There is a history here in presidential elections by the Russian
Federation, by its intelligence services,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia sought to interfere in
both the 2016 and 2020 elections.</p>
<p>But Russia has not been alone.</p>
<p>A declassified intelligence assessment looking at the 2022 midterm
elections concluded with high to moderate confidence that Russia was
joined by China and Iran in seeking to sway the outcome.</p>
<p>“China tacitly approved efforts to try to influence a handful of
midterm races involving members of both U.S. political parties,” the
report said.</p>
<p>“Tehran relied primarily on its intelligence services and Iran-based
online influencers to conduct its covert operations,” it said. “Iran’s
influence activities reflected its intent to exploit perceived social
divisions and undermine confidence in U.S. democratic institutions
during this election cycle.”</p>
<p>The United States has also alleged other adversaries, such as Cuba,
Venezuela and Lebanese Hezbollah, have sought to influence elections, as
have allies, such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>The warnings from Wray and others are encountering pushback from some
lawmakers and conservative commentators who view such statements as an
attempt to resurrect what they call the “Russia hoax” — saying the
narrative that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election
to help former President Donald Trump win is without merit.</p>
<p>Warner, however, dismissed that view in response to a question from
VOA on the sidelines of Tuesday’s security conference. “Anyone who
doesn’t think the Russian intel services have and will continue to
interfere in our elections … I wonder where they’re getting their
information to start with,” he said.</p>
<p>Wray on Thursday suggested the list of countries and other foreign
groups seeking to influence U.S. voters is set to expand. “AI is most
useful for what I would call kind of mediocre bad guys and making them
kind of like intermediate,” he said.</p>
<p>“The really sophisticated adversaries are using AI more just to
increase the speed and scale of their efforts,” he said. “But we are
coming towards a day very soon where what I would call the experts, the
most sophisticated adversaries, are going to find ways to use AI to be
even more elite.”</p>
<p>Some private cybersecurity firms also see the danger growing.</p>
<p>This past September, Microsoft warned that Beijing has developed a
new artificial intelligence capability that can produce “eye-catching
content” more likely to go viral compared to previous Chinese influence
operations.</p>
<p>Others agree.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s robocalls, whether it’s fake videos — all those things
really even back to 2022, weren’t as prevalent,” Trellix CEO Bryan Palma
told VOA. “You weren’t going to get any high-quality type of deepfake
video.</p>
<p>“I think you’re going to see more and more of that as we get closer
to the election,” he said.</p>

Lawmakers Slam Pentagon Chief Over Secrecy on Health</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — U.S. lawmakers sharply criticized Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin on Thursday over the failure to inform the White House
about his hospitalization earlier this year for complications from
cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Both Democrats and Republicans expressed dismay over the secrecy, but
the House Armed Services Committee hearing ultimately shed little light
on why information had been withheld from other top officials.</p>
<p>“It’s totally unacceptable that it took three days to inform the
president of the United States that the secretary of defense was in the
hospital and not in control of the Pentagon,” Representative Mike
Rogers, the committee’s Republican chairman, said during the
hearing.</p>
<p>“Wars were raging in Ukraine and Israel, our ships were under fire in
the Red Sea and our bases were bracing for attack in Syria and Iraq. But
the commander-in-chief did not know that his secretary of defense was
out of action,” Rogers said.</p>
<p>The committee’s ranking Democratic member, Representative Adam Smith,
said “the lack of transparency” should not be repeated and that “we need
clearer, more transparent information about what’s going on at the
Pentagon.”</p>
<p>Austin insisted “there was never a break in command and control,” but
said that “what we didn’t do well was a notification of senior
leaders.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon chief repeated that he “never told anyone not to inform
the president, White House or anyone else about my hospitalization,”
admitting however that “we didn’t get this right.”</p>
<p>Austin, a 70-year-old career soldier, initially underwent minor
surgery to treat the cancer on December 22, returning home the following
day. </p>
<p>But he was readmitted due to complications including nausea and
severe pain on January 1.</p>
<p>The White House was not informed about Austin’s hospitalization until
January 4, while Congress was not told until the following day, and
President Joe Biden did not learn of the cancer diagnosis until January
9.</p>
<p>Various Republican lawmakers called for Austin — who apologized
earlier this month for the secrecy surrounding his treatment — to be
sacked, but Biden has stood by him.</p>
<p>The Pentagon conducted a 30-day review of the situation and released
a summary on Monday that said privacy concerns contributed to the
secrecy, but found no evidence of intentional wrongdoing or
obfuscation</p>

Blocks Texas Law That Gives Police Power to Arrest Migrants Who
Illegally Enter US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas — A federal judge on Thursday blocked a new Texas law
that gives police broad powers to arrest migrants suspected of illegally
entering the U.S., dealing a victory to the Biden administration in its
feud with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott over immigration enforcement. </p>
<p>The preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge David Ezra
pauses a law that was set to take effect March 5. Texas officials are
expected to appeal. </p>
<p>Opponents have called the Texas measure the most dramatic attempt by
a state to police immigration since a 2010 Arizona law that opponents
rebuked as a “Show Me Your Papers” bill. The U.S. Supreme Court
partially struck down the Arizona law, but some Texas Republican leaders
want that ruling to get a second look. </p>
<p>The lawsuit is among several legal battles between Texas and
President Joe Biden’s administration over how far the state can go to
try to prevent migrants from crossing the border. </p>
<p>The measure would allow state law enforcement officers to arrest
people suspected of entering the country illegally. Once in custody,
they could agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the country or face a
misdemeanor charge for entering the U.S. illegally. Migrants who don’t
leave after being ordered to do so could be arrested again and charged
with a more serious felony. </p>
<p>At a February 15 hearing, Ezra expressed skepticism as the state
pleaded its case for what is known as Senate Bill 4. He also said he was
somewhat sympathetic to the concerns expressed by Abbott and other state
officials about the large number of illegal crossings. </p>
<p>Ezra, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, said he
feared the United States could become a confederation of states
enforcing their own immigration laws. “That is the same thing the Civil
War said you can’t do,” Ezra told the attorneys. </p>
<p>Civil rights groups, who also sued the state, have argued the law
could lead to civil rights violations and racial profiling. </p>
<p>Republicans who back the law have said it would not target immigrants
already living in the U.S. because of the two-year statute of
limitations on the illegal entry charge and would be enforced only along
the state’s border with Mexico. </p>
<p>Tensions have remained high between Texas and the Biden
administration this year over who can patrol the border and how. Other
GOP governors have expressed support for Abbott, who has said the
federal government is not doing enough to enforce immigration laws. </p>
<p>Among other things, Texas placed a floating barrier in the Rio
Grande, put razor wire along the U.S.-Mexico border, and stopped Border
Patrol agents from accessing a riverfront park in Eagle Pass that they
previously used to process migrants</p>

<p>
I’ve been building out a new Arm-based NAS using ASRock Rack’s new ‘Deep
Micro ATX’ motherboard for Ampere Altra and Altra Max CPUs.
</p>
<p>
I posted about the hardware earlier, in
<a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/building-efficient-server-grade-arm-nas">Building
an efficient server-grade Arm NAS</a>. Go check that out if you want
details on the specific hardware in this setup.
</p>
<p>
But at the end of the build, I installed Rocky Linux, and found the
power consumption to be a bit higher than expected—over 150W at idle!
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, the NAS must’ve been doing something when I took that
initial measurement, because after monitoring it for a few more days,
the normal idle power usage was around 123W instead.

<h2 id="chris-coyier-smells-like-donkeys">Chris Coyier smells like
donkeys</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
You might be so confused by this title. If you’re reading this Chris,
I’m just kidding, I’m sure you smell wonderfully. I just couldn’t resist
the temptation of posting something with this title after reading your
post,
<a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2024/02/28/where-im-at-on-the-whole-css-tricks-thing/">“Where
I’m at on the whole CSS-Tricks thing”</a>.
</p>
<p>
Reading your post made me think about what we should do with all these
sites we’re creating, especially big and old ones. Content is obviously
worth preserving but sites can be expensive to keep online. You wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’ve heard from plenty of people who are pissed. Some are pissed at me.
Sellout, yadda yadda. But I’m actually fairly pleased that the site is
still online, relatively untouched, and with everybody’s bylines,
including my own, intact. That’s a better outcome than scotch.io,
purchased from Chris Sev, which was neutered and ultimately turned off.
That’s a much more inglorious ending that I hope never happens to
CSS-Tricks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And you’re right, having the site still online—albeit in a weird
state—is better than having it gone altogether. But there has to be a
better solution for these situations. And that solution can’t be to
simply hope that the Internet Achieve keeps doing its wonderful job.
Still, I don’t have a solution to offer. I can only
<a href="https://archive.org/donate">encourage people to donate to the
Internet Archive</a>.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for writing that post Chris, and thank you for spending all
that time working on CSS Tricks. Now if you excuse me I’ll go learn what
the heck is a Passkey…

relatively cheap and easy way to get a foothold in organizations’ IT

<p>If we want to see even a modest reboot of blogging, as a community
thing, we’re going to have to start with something like blogrolls. I
wrote a bit yesterday about how blogrolls came about, and weblogs.com
and how that led to RSS and feed readers. This time, we don’t have to
wait for feeds to show up, they’re already there. It should happen more
quickly.</p>

This week, Disney announced that it’s joining forces with India’s
Reliance Industries to create a streaming platform that will serve up
everything from live sports — notably cricket — to Disney films to TV
dramas. It’s a strategic move from Disney in the world’s most populous
country. Plus, goods prices receded, but services inflation is getting
sticky. And: the economics (and tunes) of an HBCU marching band.

id="federal-reserves-preferred-inflation-gauge-picked-up-last-month-in-sign-of-still-elevated-prices">Federal
Reserve’s Preferred Inflation Gauge Picked Up Last Month in Sign of
Still-Elevated Prices</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve
increased in January, the latest sign that the slowdown in U.S. consumer
price increases is occurring unevenly from month to month.</p>
<p>The government reported Thursday that prices rose 0.3% from December
to January, up from 0.1% in the previous month. But in a more
encouraging sign, prices were up just 2.4% from a year earlier, down
from a 2.6% annual pace in December and the smallest such increase in
nearly three years.</p>
<p>The year-over-year cooldown in inflation is sure to be welcomed by
the White House as President Joe Biden seeks re-election. Still, even
though average paychecks have outpaced inflation over the past year,
many Americans remain frustrated that overall prices are still well
above where they were before inflation erupted three years ago. That
sentiment, evident in many public opinion polls, could pose a threat to
Biden’s re-election bid.</p>
<p>Inflation, as measured by the Fed’s preferred gauge, fell steadily
last year after having peaked at 7.1% in the summer of 2022. Supply
chain snarls have eased, reducing costs of parts and raw materials, and
a steady flow of job seekers has made it easier for employers to limit
wage increases, one of the drivers of inflation. Still, inflation
remains above the central bank’s 2% annual target.</p>
<p>Excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices rose 0.4% from
December to January, up from 0.1% in the previous month. And compared
with a year earlier, such so-called “core” prices rose 2.8%, down from
2.9% in December. Economists consider core prices a better gauge of the
likely path of future inflation.</p>
<p>Some of January’s inflation reflects the fact that companies often
raise prices in the first two months of the year, leaving January and
February price data high compared with the rest of the year. But the
costs of hospital and doctors’ services are also rising to offset the
sizable pay raises commanded by nurses and other in-demand health care
workers.</p>
<p>That trend could help keep inflation elevated in the coming months.
But by early spring, most analysts expect prices to settle back to the
milder pace of increases that occurred in the second half of 2023, when
inflation eased to a 2% annual rate.</p>
<p>January’s uptick in inflation helps explain the concern expressed by
many Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, about potentially
cutting interest rates too soon this year. One influential official,
Christopher Waller of the Fed’s Board of Governors, said this month that
he would want to see two more months of inflation data after January’s
to determine whether prices were cooling sustainably toward the Fed’s
target level.</p>
<p>Beginning in March 2022, the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times
to attack the worst bout of inflation in 40 years. Those rate hikes have
helped cool inflation drastically. But they have also made borrowing
much more expensive for consumers and businesses. In particular, high
loan rates have throttled sales in the economy’s crucial homebuying
sector. Conversely, rate cuts by the Fed, whenever they happen, would
eventually lead to lower borrowing costs across the economy.</p>
<p>Thursday’s inflation data mirrors figures released earlier this month
that showed that the government’s more widely followed consumer price
index also rose faster in January than it had in previous months. The
Fed prefers the measure reported Thursday, in part because it accounts
for changes in how people shop when inflation jumps — when, for example,
consumers shift away from pricey national brands in favor of cheaper
store brands.</p>
<p>Several Fed officials have said they’re optimistic that inflation
will continue to fall back toward the Fed’s target level, with some
downplaying the recent pickup in prices as a one-time jump.</p>
<p>“The path will continue to be bumpy, and we should not overreact to
individual data readings,” Susan Collins, president of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, said Wednesday. “I remain what I call a
‘realistic optimist’ in thinking that the economy is on a path to 2%
inflation on a sustained basis while maintaining a healthy labor
market.”</p>
<p>Some other officials sound more uncertain. Jeffrey Schmid, the new
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said this week
that “when it comes to too-high inflation, I believe we are not out of
the woods yet.”</p>
<p>Outside the Fed, most economists envision a steady, if fitful,
slowdown of inflation in the coming months. Economists at Goldman Sachs
project that core inflation, as measured by the Fed’s preferred gauge,
will drop rapidly to just 2.2% by May — low enough for the Fed to
initiate rate cuts in June.</p>

<h2 id="pluralistic-lies-damned-lies-and-uber-29-feb-2024">Pluralistic:
Lies, damned lies, and Uber (29 Feb 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Lies, damned lies, and Uber: Uber wants to pay its
Toronto drivers $2.50/hour (eh). Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent
publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects,
current reading Lies, damned lies, and Uber (permalink) Uber lies about
everything, especially money. Oh, and labour. Especially labour. And
geometry. Especially geometry! But especially especially money. They
constantly lie about money. Uber are virtuosos of mendacity, but in
Toronto, the company has attained a heretofore unseen hat-trick: they
told a single lie that is dramatically, materially untruthful about
money, labour and geometry! It’s an achievement for the ages. Here’s how
they did it. For several decades, Toronto has been clobbered by the
misrule of a series of far-right, clownish mayors. This was the result
of former Ontario Premier Mike Harris’s great gerrymander of 1998, when
the city of Toronto was amalgamated with its car-dependent suburbs. This
set the tone for the next quarter-century, as these outlying regions –
utterly dependent on Toronto for core economic activity and massive
subsidies to pay the unsustainable utility and infrastructure bills for
sprawling neighborhoods of single-family homes – proceeded to gut the
city they relied on. These “conservative” mayors – the philanderer, the
crackhead, the sexual predator – turned the city into a corporate
playground, swapping public housing and rent controls for out-of-control
real-estate speculation and trading out some of the world’s best transit
for total car-dependency. As part of that decay, the city rolled out the
red carpet for Uber, allowing the company to put as many unlicensed
taxis as they wanted on the city’s streets. Now, it’s hard to overstate
the dire traffic situation in Toronto. Years of neglect and
underinvestment in both the roads and the transit system have left both
in a state of near collapse and it’s not uncommon for multiple,
consecutive main arteries to shut down without notice for weeks, months,
or, in a few cases, years. The proliferation of Ubers on the road –
driven by desperate people trying to survive the city’s cost-of-living
catastrophe – has only exacerbated this problem. Uber, of course, would
dispute this. The company insists – despite all common sense and
peer-reviewed research – that adding more cars to the streets alleviates
traffic. This is easily disproved: there just isn’t any way to swap
buses, streetcars, and subways for cars. The road space needed for all
those single-occupancy cars pushes everything further apart, which means
we need more cars, which means more roads, which means more distance
between things, and so on. It is an undeniable fact that geometry hates
cars. But geometry loathes Uber. Because Ubers have all the problems of
single-occupancy vehicles, and then they have the separate problem that
they just end up circling idly around the city’s streets, waiting for a
rider. The more Ubers there are on the road, the longer each car ends up
waiting for a passenger:
https://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Uber-Lyft-San-Francisco-pros-cons-ride-hailing-13841277.php
Anything that can’t go on forever eventually stops. After years of
bumbling-to-sinister municipal rule, Toronto finally reclaimed its
political power and voted in a new mayor, Olivia Chow, a progressive of
long tenure and great standing (I used to ring doorbells for her when
she was campaigning for her city council seat). Mayor Chow announced
that she was going to reclaim the city’s prerogative to limit the number
of Ubers on the road, ending the period of Uber’s “self-regulation.”
Uber, naturally, lost its shit. The company claims to be more than a
(geometrically impossible) provider of convenient transportation for
Torontonians, but also a provider of good jobs for working people. And
to prove it, the company has promised to pay its drivers “120% of
minimum wage.” As I write for Ricochet, that’s a whopper, even by Uber’s
standards:
https://ricochet.media/en/4039/uber-is-lying-again-the-company-has-no-intention-of-paying-drivers-a-living-wage
Here’s the thing: Uber is only proposing to pay 120% of the minimum wage
while drivers have a passenger in the vehicle. And with the number of
vehicles Uber wants on the road, most drivers will be earning nothing
most of the time. Factor in that unpaid time, as well as expenses for
vehicles, and the average Toronto Uber driver stands to make $2.50 per
hour (Canadian):
https://ridefair.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Legislated-Poverty.pdf
Now, Uber’s told a lot of lies over the years. Right from the start, the
company implicitly lied about what it cost to provide an Uber. For its
first 12 years, Uber lost $0.41 on every dollar it brought in, lighting
tens of billions in investment capital provided by the Saudi royals on
fire in an effort to bankrupt rival transportation firms and provoke
disinvestment in municipal transit. Uber then lied to retail investors
about the business case for buying its stock so that the House of Saud
and other early investors could unload their stock. Uber claimed that
they were on the verge of producing a self-driving car that would allow
them to get rid of drivers, zero out their wage bill, and finally turn a
profit. The company spent $2.5b on this, making it the most expensive
Big Store in the history of cons:
https://www.theinformation.com/articles/infighting-busywork-missed-warnings-how-uber-wasted-2-5-billion-on-self-driving-cars
After years, Uber produced a “self-driving car” that could travel one
half of one American mile before experiencing a potentially lethal
collision. Uber quietly paid another company $400m to take this disaster
off its hands:
https://www.economist.com/business/2020/12/10/why-is-uber-selling-its-autonomous-vehicle-division
The self-driving car lie was tied up in another lie – that somehow,
automation could triumph over geometry. Robocabs, we were told, would
travel in formations so tight that they would finally end the Red
Queen’s Race of more cars – more roads – more distance – more cars. That
lie wormed its way into the company’s IPO prospectus, which promised
retail investors that profitability lay in replacing every journey – by
car, cab, bike, bus, tram or train – with an Uber ride:
https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1RN2SK/ The company has been
bleeding out money ever since – though you wouldn’t know it by looking
at its investor disclosures. Every quarter, Uber trumpets that it has
finally become profitable, and every quarter, Hubert Horan dissects its
balance sheets to find the accounting trick the company thought of this
time. There was one quarter where Uber declared profitability by marking
up the value of stock it held in Uber-like companies in other countries.
How did it get this stock? Well, Uber tried to run a business in those
countries and it was such a total disaster that they had to flee the
country, selling their business to a failing domestic competitor in
exchange for stock in its collapsing business. Naturally, there’s no
market for this stock, which, in Uber-land, means you can assign any
value you want to it. So that one quarter, Uber just asserted that the
stock had shot up in value and voila, profit!
https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2022/02/hubert-horan-can-uber-ever-deliver-part-twenty-nine-despite-massive-price-increases-uber-losses-top-31-billion.html
But all of those lies are as nothing to the whopper that Uber is trying
to sell to Torontonians by blanketing the city in ads: the lie that by
paying drivers $2.50/hour to fill the streets with more single-occupancy
cars, they will turn a profit, reduce the city’s traffic, and provide
good jobs. Uber says it can vanquish geometry, economics and working
poverty with the awesome power of narrative. In other words, it’s taking
Toronto for a bunch of suckers. (Image: Rob Sinclair, CC BY 2.0&lt;) Hey

<li>Apple workers reportedly nicknamed doomed EV ‘the Titanic disaster’
</h3>
<p>
More details are emerging about Apple’s ill-fated self-driving electric
vehicle, which was reportedly scrapped this week. The secret car –
codenamed “Project Titan” – had been in the works since 2014, and was
the company’s attempt to protect itself from an anticipated slow-down in
iPhone sales. Entering the car market seemed an obvious next step for
the company. “Apple would do to cars what it did to phones,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b1e3b4e3ff&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
Tim Higgins at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.
</p>
<p>
But after several starts and stops and at least four project leaders,
most employees knew it was going to fail. They even nicknamed it “the
Titanic disaster,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d2c1001ab1&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">according
to</a> <em>The New York Times</em>. The project lacked clarity and
identity. Was it a Tesla rival? A self-driving car? All of the above?
“Project Titan’s ambitions became diminished, less compelling — from an
electric, robot car, then just about perfecting autonomy, then just
about an EV,” Higgins said.
</p>
<p>
One thing’s for sure, Project Titan was expensive, costing the company
$10 billion in the end. “Developing the software and algorithms for a
car with autonomous driving features proved too difficult,” the
<em>Times</em> reported. With that car crash in its rear-view mirror,
Apple plans to accelerate its work on generative AI.

<li>New York sues world’s top meatpacker over net zero claims
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>New York state has filed a lawsuit against the world’s
biggest meat producer, JBS USA, alleging the Brazil-based company has
misled the public about its environmental impact,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f75ff09d9a&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">according
to</a> <em>Bloomberg</em>. JBS has promised to be net zero by 2040, but
the filing claims the company cannot possibly reach this goal and has no
plan to do so. Food production accounts for one third of global
greenhouse gases, and livestock alone produces nearly 15% of all
emissions. JBS has annual revenues of more than $50 billion and its
supply chain relies on thousands of farms in the Amazon, many of which
overlap on Indigenous land and conservation areas,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=bbf191b7f6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
<em>The New York Times</em>. Last year JBS was found to have one of the
lowest integrity scores among major companies that have made climate
pledges. It is currently trying to get its shares listed on the New York
Stock Exchange, but has faced fierce opposition from environmentalists,
U.S.-based beef producers, and both Democrats and Republicans.

<li>Oil and gas giants eye geothermal projects

<p>
<strong></strong>Major fossil fuel companies are investing big money in
geothermal energy startups and projects, <em>The Wall Street Journal
</em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5d344e7ba3&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>.
“Many of these companies are using the same technology employed by
frackers, but instead of searching for oil and gas, they are looking for
underground heat,” the <em>Journal</em> adds. That heat can be harnessed
to provide constant carbon-free electricity, and startups like Fervo
Energy are finding new ways to make drilling for geothermal energy much
cheaper, as
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b7b2b359ca&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Heatmap</em>’s
Matthew Zeitlin recently reported</a>. Fervo is raising $244 million in
new funding, including $100 million from fossil fuel company Devon
Energy. “Once the industry is proven, I would not be surprised for
today’s oil-and-gas industry to either buy or build their way to be
significant players in advanced geothermal,” said billionaire former
Enron trader John Arnold.

“Frontier” Became the Slogan of Uncontrolled AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, updated: 2024-02-29, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been billed as the next frontier of
humanity: the newly available expanse whose exploration will drive the
next era of growth, wealth, and human flourishing. It’s a scary
metaphor. Throughout American history, the drive for expansion and the
very concept of terrain up for grabs—land grabs, gold rushes, new
frontiers—have provided a permission structure for imperialism and
exploitation. This could easily hold true for AI.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t the first time the concept of a frontier has been used as a
metaphor for AI, or technology in general. As early as 2018, the
powerful foundation models powering cutting-edge applications like

system has fallen apart and Americans reevaluated what they want out of
their government.</p>

Deemed ‘Healthy, Active, Robust’ During Annual Physical Exam</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden’s is a “healthy, active, robust
81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of
the presidency,” his physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, said in a statement
released by the White House on Wednesday, following Biden’s annual
physical examination. </p>
<p>“The president feels well, and this year’s physical identified no new
concerns. He continues to be fit for duty and fully executes all of his
responsibilities without any exemptions or accommodations,” O’Connor
said following Biden’s visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical
Center in Bethesda, Maryland, earlier Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The checkup included consultations with optometry, dentistry,
orthopedics, physical therapy, neurology, sleep medicine, cardiology,
radiology and dermatology specialists, O’Connor said.  </p>
<p>It’s Biden’s third physical since taking office, amid concerns about
his age as he seeks a second term.  </p>
<p>“They think I look too young,” Biden joked to reporters at the White
House after his checkup. “There is nothing different than last year,” he
said.</p>
<p>According to the summary, Biden is currently being treated for
several conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea, gastroesophageal
reflux, seasonal allergies, arthritis and sensory peripheral neuropathy
of the feet. He also has atrial fibrillation with normal ventricular
response, a type of asymptomatic irregularity of the heartbeat.  </p>
<p>His doctor pronounced his conditions as “stable and well-controlled,”
with “three common prescription medications and three common
over-the-counter medications.”  </p>
<p>The symptoms were similar to those described in Biden’s 2023 physical
exam report that noted the president’s “stiff gait,” due to “a
combination of significant spinal arthritis, mild post-fracture foot
arthritis and a mild sensory peripheral neuropathy of the feet,” and
“occasional symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux,” that made him have to
clear his throat often.     </p>
<p>President didn’t undergo cognitive test </p>
<p>Recent events have highlighted Biden’s potential age-related issues,
including the president being described in a special counsel report as
an “elderly man with a poor memory.”      </p>
<p>In pushing back on reporters’ questions about his age, Biden insisted
that his “memory is fine” but shortly after mistakenly referred to
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi as the president of Mexico.
That and two other mistaken references to world leaders’ names in recent
weeks fueled further attacks by his rivals.     </p>
<p>Responding to reporters’ questions during her briefing on Wednesday,
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden did not
undergo a cognitive test as part of his physical because the president’s
physician, “doesn’t believe that he needs one.” </p>
<p>As president, Biden passes a cognitive test “every day,” Jean-Pierre
underscored. </p>
<p>A poll by the George Washington University shows 35% of respondents
say Biden was in good enough physical health to serve effectively as
president, and 38% said he has the mental soundness to serve effectively
as president.  </p>
<p>This is lower that what respondents say about the leading candidate
for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump, who is four
years younger. For Trump, the numbers are 54% and 46%,
respectively. </p>
<p>“These figures indicate that this is a big problem for Biden,” Todd
Belt, professor of politics at George Washington University, told VOA.
“The campaign has changed course to attack Trump on his vulnerabilities
on the mental soundness issue.” </p>
<p>Biden did exactly that during an appearance on a late-night
television show earlier this week, by referencing a video in which Trump
appeared to forget his wife’s name.  </p>
<p>Americans concerned about Biden’s age</p>
<p>Trump was 70 when he took office in 2017, which made him the oldest
American president to be inaugurated until Biden broke his record at 78
in 2021. The former president has also made blunders, including praising
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for his leadership of Turkey, and
confusing his Republican rival, Nikki Haley, with former U.S. House
Speaker Nancy Pelosi.   </p>
<p>A February ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted after the release of the
special counsel report indicated concerns among 59% of Americans
regarding the age and capability for a second term for both candidates,
although more Americans are worried about Biden compared with Trump,
said Clifford Young, president of Ipsos Public Affairs.   </p>
<p>“Age is an Achilles’ heel, is an anchor for Biden,” Young told VOA.
“It was four years ago. Without a doubt, it will be this year.”   </p>
<p>Though not publicly announced in advance, the timing of Biden’s
physical was anticipated, given the increasing focus on his age and
health in the context of his reelection campaign ahead of the November
election.</p>

Find Shelter at Washington State Church</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tukwila, Washington — Though the number of migrants crossing daily
into the United States has fallen since December, local communities are
still scrambling to provide them with resources.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, Riverton Park United Methodist Church in
Tukwila, Washington, has become a shelter for hundreds of asylum-seekers
from Africa and Latin America.</p>
<p>At the church entrance is a hum of conversations in Portuguese,
French and Spanish, as asylum-seekers from countries such as Angola,
Congo and Venezuela gather to discuss their immigration claims.</p>
<p>Eurice, a bespectacled woman in her 50s, came from Venezuela. She
asked that her last name not be used.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be a burden to the United States,” she said. “I
didn’t come here for a dream. Because of my work at the Colombian
consulate, I was labeled a traitor. I’ve worked all my life, and instead
of a peaceful retirement, I had to flee my country, walking through the
jungle, crossing seven countries.”</p>
<p>She said she is grateful to find shelter at this church.</p>
<p>“I thank God and the lady pastor for providing a roof over my head, a
bed to sleep in, and a plate of food. I am blessed already,” she
said.</p>
<p>Pastor Jan Bolerjack said that over the past year, Riverton has
helped find shelter, food and basic necessities for about 1,000
asylum-seekers of various ages, including pregnant women and toddlers.
Some of them arrived on their own. Others were brought in by the
police.</p>
<p>“The police department in Seattle found them on the streets in tents
and realized they were a different population from our usual homeless
individuals,” Bolerjack told VOA. “And so, they started bringing them
here. We went from zero to 100 by March 2023, and then 400 by July. In
October, the mayor of Tukwila declared a humanitarian emergency here.
And this is where we are now — continuing with this humanitarian
emergency.”</p>
<p>Unlike refugees who are eligible for resettlement services,
asylum-seekers are unable to work legally before their work permit
application is approved in a process that may last many months.</p>
<p>Bolerjack said her church has always had an open door for the most
vulnerable members of the community, but with limited resources, staff
and volunteers are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“We have to provide everything, from food to laundry to bathrooms,
showers, tents, sleeping bags, mattresses. Everything has to come from
our friends and sources in the neighborhood,” she explained, walking
through the church hall where piles of donated mattresses, suitcases and
bags line the walls, and past a tiny kitchen, where several young
African women are cooking, and through an area where volunteers sort
donated clothes.</p>
<p>“Somehow, this place has been advertised across the country and at
the border as the place to go,” Bolerjack explained. “And you know, I
can take great pride in that. And yet, I’m kind of embarrassed when they
arrive after a long, traumatic journey and we have to say, ‘You have to
sleep in a wet, soggy tent.’”</p>
<p>In winter, when temperatures in the area dropped below zero, hundreds
of asylum-seekers were temporarily moved from tents to local hotels.
Some refused to return to the encampment, asking lawmakers for help.</p>
<p>State Representative Mia Gregerson is working to improve the state’s
response to the crisis with legislation to better coordinate migrant
services. Speaking with VOA at her office in the state capital, Olympia,
she said that despite Tukwila’s tradition of welcoming newcomers, the
community of fewer than 22,000 people shouldn’t be pushed to shoulder
the crisis on its own.</p>
<p>“I think they’re really rolling up their sleeves well and making a go
of it,” Gregerson said. “But there is a lot of uncertainty. What are we
going to do when the funds run out?”</p>
<p>She said processing asylum cases is often complicated by different
immigration statuses within a family. The bill she introduced with 18
co-sponsors seeks to empower the state’s Office of Refugee and Immigrant
Assistance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The idea is that the office is able to be nimble and utilize
resources quickly to not only put them into the system for legal advice
that’s correct and factual, or quickly get them the education resources,
transportation needs, and housing vouchers,” Gregerson said. “And we
need to maintain that contact with them so we can help them through the
system. Otherwise, they may fall victim to other types of issues.”</p>
<p>Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s current budget includes $5 million
in new funding for the Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance to
expand support services for newly arriving people who do not qualify for
federal refugee resettlement program services. A separate request for
$3.4 million is meant to help provide transitional and long-term housing
support to asylum-seekers in the county around Seattle.</p>
<p>Volunteers at Riverton help asylum-seekers complete the required
paperwork in English. In the past year, Bolerjack said just one person
won their asylum case and obtained a work permit.</p>
<p>That has not diminished the optimism of Jeremiah Lefau, who said he
left Angola with his wife and three children in December 2022 because of
insecurity in his country. They lived at Riverton for four months before
they were approved for family shelter. The children are enrolled in
local schools along with more than 100 young asylum-seekers. Lefau is
taking English classes and volunteers at the church.</p>
<p>“I feel good about the future,” he said. “Now, we need to help others
as the church helped us.”</p>
<p>Eurice, from Venezuela, hopes to return to her country someday.</p>
<p>“My family is still there. I miss them,” she said. “I hope to stay
here as long as necessary to be safe, and I thank the United States for
this opportunity they are giving us. But I have faith that one day my
country will be able to repair itself so I can return.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Biden administration is advancing measures making it
more challenging for asylum-seekers to stay in the U.S.</p>

<h2 id="biden-hails-crime-drop-pushes-for-more-reforms">Biden Hails
Crime Drop, Pushes for More Reforms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden brought law enforcement officials
from key swing states into the White House on Wednesday as he touted
declines in crime in major cities and pressed Congress for more action
on policing and gun control.</p>
<p>“Murder, rape, aggravated assault, robbery — all dropped sharply,
along with burglary, property crime and theft. And it matters,” Biden
said, speaking to a gathering that included law enforcement officials
from Chicago, Philadelphia, Miami, Detroit and Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Data from the nation’s top law enforcement entity, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, show a clear decline in violent crime since 2020.
 </p>
<p>Detroit Police Chief James White, speaking at the White House on
Wednesday, said funding from Biden’s 2021 American Rescue Plan was “a
tremendous game changer for Detroit. It’s helped us reach these historic
lows in crime.”</p>
<p>White said Detroit’s police department has used those funds not just
for traditional law enforcement but also to expand the force’s mental
health services.</p>
<p>Floyd legislation</p>
<p>Biden on Wednesday also renewed his call for lawmakers to pass the
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. That act, named after a Black
Minneapolis resident who was killed by a police officer in 2020, aims to
increase police accountability, transparency and data collection, and to
improve police practices and training. </p>
<p>He also called for further action on gun control, which has been
stridently opposed by powerful industry players like the National Rifle
Association.</p>
<p>“I’ve taken more executive actions to stop the flow of illegal guns
than any other administration in history,” Biden said. “And we beat the
NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30
years. And we’re going to finish the job. We’re going to ban assault
weapons and high-capacity magazines next time around because it has to
be done.”</p>
<p>On the issue of gun ownership, a Pew Research Center poll found that
Americans are split. About one-third of Americans say they own a
gun.</p>
<p>Gun safety advocates on Wednesday praised the Biden administration’s
moves on gun safety. Monisha Henley, senior vice president of government
affairs at Everytown for Gun Safety, described Biden’s White House as
“the strongest gun safety administration in history.”</p>
<p>“Our top priority is getting the Biden-Harris administration to
implement the ATF’s lifesaving rule to close deadly loopholes in our
background check system as written,” she said in a statement provided to
VOA. ATF refers to the federal the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
and Explosives.</p>
<p>“We plan to work closely with the administration this year as they
continue to advance their ambitious gun violence prevention agenda,”
Henley said.</p>
<p>But Biden faces harsh criticism over his public safety policies from
his main political challenger, Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Trump’s
campaign described Biden’s plan as a “pro-crime, anti-police
agenda.”</p>
<p>“President Donald Trump stands with police,” the campaign said in a
statement. “[Trump] is promising to indemnify all police officers and
law enforcement officials throughout the United States.”</p>
<p>Biden, on Wednesday, defined the challenge of public safety through a
different lens.</p>
<p>“There is no greater responsibility than to ensure the safety of
families, children, communities and our nation,” he said.</p>

id="iran-backed-attacks-slow-since-3-us-service-members-killed">Iran-backed
Attacks Slow Since 3 US Service Members Killed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Capitol Hill — Attacks by Iranian-backed proxies have slowed since
the drone attack in January that killed three U.S. service members in
Jordan near the Syrian border.</p>
<p>There have been only two minor attacks in Syria since Feb. 2, when
the United States launched retaliatory attacks on targets in Syria and
Iraq.</p>
<p>But U.S. lawmakers warned Wednesday that the lull does not
de-escalate the risks of a regional conflict.</p>
<p>“Iran doesn’t have complete command and control of their operations,”
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said Wednesday.
“That makes this a very precarious situation, one that requires careful
clear-eyed American leadership. The risks of miscalculation would not
only lead to another deadly attack against U.S. service members, it
could lead to a full-scale regional war.”</p>
<p>The U.S. military said U.S. and coalition forces shot down five
Houthi drones late Tuesday in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said the drones were launched from areas of
Yemen controlled by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and that the drones
“presented an imminent threat to merchant vessels and to the U.S. Navy
and coalition ships in the region.”</p>
<p>The strikes were the latest in months of actions seeking to counter
attacks by the Houthis against vessels in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The Houthis have said they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians
amid the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>“Iran thrives on chaos and suffering. The best way to undermine
threat in the long term is to offer an alternative — a comprehensive and
lasting peace that allows for real regional integration. I realize this
is no easy task, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t make our efforts,”
Cardin said.</p>
<p>The White House called the January attack “despicable and wholly
unjust,” and killed the leader of the Kataib Hezbollah group in a
targeted airstrike on Feb. 8 in retaliation.</p>
<p>Senate Republicans characterized the Biden administration’s overall
approach to dealing with Iran as weak.</p>
<p>Senator Jim Risch, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, called on the administration to do a better job of
denying Iran the resources it uses to commit acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration has still not articulated a coherent Iran
policy outside of the nuclear negotiations. It’s time to change course,”
Risch said Wednesday. “We must adopt a policy of containment. Iran does
not think like the West, and it cannot be taught or turned into a change
in conduct.”</p>
<p>Brian Hook, the former U.S. special representative for Iran during
the Trump administration, told senators, “I believe that Iran knows that
it can safely expand its Axis of Resistance because of the Biden
administration’s deep aversion to defensive military action. The Biden
administration de-escalates to de-escalate. The Iranian regime thrives
under this strategy. American troops do not.”</p>
<p>The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is considering Risch’s
legislation to better enforce U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil.</p>
<p>“Iran is always going to make sure that Hezbollah gets what it
needs,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy told VOA. “Their support for
proxies is a very low-cost means of provoking the United States. I mean,
we would be foolish to think that an oil sanction here, there, is going
to change Iran’s decision to fund a group like Hezbollah.”</p>

<h2 id="us-schools-wrestle-with-cellphones-in-classrooms">US Schools
Wrestle with Cellphones in Classrooms</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — In California, a high school teacher complains that
students watch Netflix on their phones during class. In Maryland, a
chemistry teacher says students use gambling apps to place bets during
the school day.</p>
<p>Around the country, educators say students routinely send Snapchat
messages in class, listen to music and shop online, among countless
other examples of how smartphones distract from teaching and
learning.</p>
<p>The hold that phones have on adolescents in America today is
well-documented, but teachers say parents are often not aware to what
extent students use them inside the classroom. And increasingly,
educators and experts are speaking with one voice on the question of how
to handle it: Ban phones during classes.</p>
<p>“Students used to have an understanding that you aren’t supposed to
be on your phone in class. Those days are gone,” said James Granger, who
requires students in his science classes at a Los Angeles-area high
school to place their phones in “a cellphone cubby” with numbered slots.
“The only solution that works is to physically remove the cellphone from
the student.”</p>
<p>Most schools already have rules regulating student phone use, but
they are enforced sporadically. A growing number of leaders at the state
and federal levels have begun endorsing school cellphone bans and
suggesting new ways to curb access to the devices.</p>
<p>The latest state intervention came in Utah, where Gov. Spencer Cox, a
Republican, last month urged all school districts and the state Board of
Education to remove cellphones from classrooms. He cited studies that
show learning improves, distractions are decreased and students are more
likely to talk to each other if phones are taken away.</p>
<p>“We just need a space for six or seven hours a day where kids are not
tethered to these devices,” Cox told reporters this month. He said his
initiative, which is not binding, is part of a legislative push to
protect kids in Utah from the harms of social media.</p>
<p>Last year, Florida became the first state to crack down on phones in
school. A law that took effect in July requires all Florida public
schools to ban student cellphone use during class time and block access
to social media on district Wi-Fi. Some districts, including Orange
County Public Schools, went further and banned phones the entire school
day.</p>
<p>Oklahoma, Vermont and Kansas have also recently introduced what is
becoming known as “phone-free schools” legislation.</p>
<p>And two U.S. senators — Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, and Tim
Kaine, a Virginia Democrat — introduced legislation in December that
would require a federal study on the effects of cellphone use in schools
on students’ mental health and academic performance. Theirs is one of
several bipartisan alliances calling for stiffer rules for social media
companies and greater online safety for kids.</p>
<p>Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at
school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for
Education Statistics.</p>
<p>But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are
following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.</p>
<p>Just ask teachers.</p>
<p>“Cellphone use is out of control. By that, I mean that I cannot
control it, even in my own classroom,” said Patrick Truman, who teaches
at a Maryland high school that forbids student use of cellphones during
class. It is up to each teacher to enforce the policy, so Truman bought
a 36-slot caddy for storing student phones. Still, every day, students
hide phones in their laps or under books as they play video games and
check social media.</p>
<p>Tired of being the phone police, he has come to a reluctant
conclusion: “Students who are on their phones are at least quiet. They
are not a behavior issue.”</p>
<p>A study last year from Common Sense Media found that 97% of kids use
their phones during school hours, and that kids say school cellphone
policies vary — often from one classroom to another — and aren’t always
enforced.</p>
<p>For a school cellphone ban to work, educators and experts say the
school administration must be the one to enforce it and not leave that
task to teachers. The Phone-Free Schools Movement, an advocacy group
formed last year by concerned mothers, says policies that allow students
to keep phones in their backpacks, as many schools do, are
ineffective.</p>
<p>“If the bookbag is on the floor next to them, it’s buzzing and
distracting, and they have the temptation to want to check it,” said Kim
Whitman, a co-founder of the group, which advises schools to require
phones be turned off and locked away all day.</p>
<p>Some students say such policies take away their autonomy and cut off
their main mode of communication with family and friends. Pushback also
has come from parents who fear being cut off from their kids if there is
a school emergency. Whitman advises schools to make exceptions for
students with special educational and medical needs, and to inform
parents on expert guidance that phones can be a dangerous distraction
for students during an emergency.</p>
<p>Jaden Willoughey, 14, shares the concern about being out of contact
with his parents if there’s a crisis. But he also sees the upsides of
turning in his phone at school.</p>
<p>At Delta High School in rural Utah, where Jaden is a freshman,
students are required to check their phones at the door when entering
every class. Each of the school’s 30 or so classrooms has a cellphone
storage unit that looks like an over-the-door shoe bag with three dozen
smartphone-sized slots.</p>
<p>“It helps you focus on your work, and it’s easier to pay attention in
class,” Jaden said.</p>
<p>A classmate, Mackenzie Stanworth, 14, said it would be hard to ignore
her phone if it was within reach. It’s a relief, she said, to “take a
break from the screen and the social life on your phone and actually
talk to people in person.”</p>
<p>It took a few years to tweak the cellphone policy and find a system
that worked, said Jared Christensen, the school’s vice principal.</p>
<p>“At first it was a battle. But it has been so worth it,” he said.
“Students are more attentive and engaged during class time. Teachers are
able to teach without competing with cellphones. And student learning
has increased,” he said, citing test scores that are at or above state
averages for the first time in years. “I can’t definitively say it’s
because of this policy. But I know it’s helping.”</p>
<p>The next battle will be against earbuds and smartwatches, he said.
Even with phones stashed in pouches, students get caught listening to
music on air pods hidden under their hair or hoodies. “We haven’t
included earbuds in our policy yet. But we’re almost there.”</p>

Seeks to Block Stormy Daniels, Cohen Testimony at Hush Money Trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Donald Trump is seeking to block porn star Stormy Daniels
and his former lawyer Michael Cohen from testifying at the former U.S.
president’s upcoming criminal trial on charges stemming from hush money
paid to Daniels before the 2016 election.</p>
<p>The case is the first of four indictments Trump faces to reach trial
as he campaigns to regain the presidency. New York state prosecutors in
Manhattan say Trump falsified business records to cover up Cohen’s
$130,000 payment to Daniels for her silence about a 2006 sexual liaison
she says she had with Trump.</p>
<p>Trump denies having had sex with Daniels and has pleaded not
guilty.</p>
<p>In a February 22 court filing made public this week, Trump lawyer
Todd Blanche said Cohen had a history of lying and that he would lie
again at the trial, which starts on March 25. Blanche said Daniels,
whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, would seek to use the trial to
promote and monetize her story.</p>
<p>“Similar to Cohen, she seeks to tell contrived stories with salacious
details of events she claimed occurred nearly 20 years ago,” Blanche
wrote.</p>
<p>Cohen’s lawyer declined to comment. A lawyer for Daniels did not
immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Cohen in 2018 pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance
laws with the payment to Daniels, which exceeded contribution limits,
and to lying before Congress. In testimony at a separate civil trial
last year, he said he lied during his 2018 guilty plea by admitting to
tax evasion. </p>
<p>In a February 15 court hearing, a prosecutor with the Manhattan
District Attorney’s Office said Trump would have the chance to
cross-examine Cohen at trial.</p>
<p>Cohen is expected to be a key witness against Trump. Prosecutors say
his payment to Daniels was part of a broader “catch-and-kill” scheme to
prevent allegations that Trump had extramarital affairs from coming to
light ahead of the 2016 election.</p>
<p>They said the scheme also included a $150,0000 payment a tabloid
publisher made on Trump’s behalf to Karen McDougal, a former Playboy
model who says she had sexual encounters with Trump, who denies the
affair.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are also asking Justice Juan Merchan to impose a gag
order restricting Trump from disparaging witnesses and others involved
in the case.</p>
<p>Trump faces 34 felony falsification of business records counts over
his 2017 reimbursements to Cohen for the Daniels payment. Prosecutors
say his New York-based family real estate company falsely recorded the
reimbursement as legal expenses.</p>
<p>Blanche said prosecutors should be barred from arguing that the
payments to Daniels and McDougal were part of an effort by Trump to
influence the 2016 election.</p>
<p>“Accounts of alleged interactions posed the risk of significant
reputational damage to President Trump, his family, and business
interests, separate and apart from his candidacy,” Blanche wrote.</p>
<p>Merchan will decide on the requests ahead of the trial, which is
expected to last up to six weeks.</p>
<p>Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican nomination, also faces
state and federal charges over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election
loss and a federal case over his handling of government documents after
leaving office. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>

id="older-us-adults-should-get-another-covid-shot-say-health-officials">Older
US Adults Should Get Another COVID Shot, Say Health Officials</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Older U.S. adults should roll up their sleeves for another
COVID-19 shot, even if they got a booster in the fall, U.S. health
officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans 65 and
older should get another dose of the updated vaccine that became
available in September — if at least four months has passed since their
last shot. In making the recommendation, the agency endorsed guidance
proposed by an expert advisory panel earlier in the day.</p>
<p>“Most COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations last year were among
people 65 years and older. An additional vaccine dose can provide added
protection … for those at highest risk,” CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The advisory panel’s decision came after a lengthy discussion about
whether to say older people “may” get the shots or if they “should” do
so. That reflects a debate among experts about how necessary another
booster is and whether yet another recommendation would add to the
public’s growing vaccine fatigue.</p>
<p>Some doctors say most older adults are adequately protected by the
fall shot, which built on immunity derived from earlier vaccinations and
exposure to the virus itself. And preliminary studies so far have shown
no substantial waning in vaccine effectiveness over six months.</p>
<p>However, the body’s vaccine-induced defenses tend to fade over time,
and that happens faster in seniors than in other adults. The committee
had recommended COVID-19 booster doses for older adults in 2022 and
2023.</p>
<p>Virus still a threat</p>
<p>COVID-19 remains a danger, especially to older people and those with
underlying medical conditions. There are still more than 20,000
hospitalizations and more than 2,000 deaths each week due to the
coronavirus, according to the CDC. And people 65 and older have the
highest hospitalization and death rates.</p>
<p>Some members of the advisory panel said a “should” recommendation is
meant to more clearly prod doctors and pharmacists to offer the
shots.</p>
<p>Dr. Jamie Loehr, a committee member and family doctor in Ithaca, New
York, said that with the “should” recommendation, “I am trying to make
it easier for providers to say, ‘Yes, we recommend this.’”</p>
<p>In September, the government recommended a new COVID-19 shot recipe
built against a version of the coronavirus called XBB.1.5. That
single-target vaccine replaced combination shots that had been targeting
both the original coronavirus strain and a much earlier omicron
version.</p>
<p>Vaccine uptake has declined</p>
<p>The CDC recommended the new shots for everyone 6 months and older and
allowed that people with weak immune systems could get a second dose as
early as two months after the first.</p>
<p>Most Americans haven’t listened. According to the latest CDC data,
13% of U.S. children have gotten the shots and about 22% of U.S. adults
have. The vaccination rate is higher for adults 65 and older, at nearly
42%.</p>
<p>“In each successive vaccine, the uptake has gone down,” said
Dr. David Canaday, a Case Western Reserve University infectious-diseases
expert who studies COVID-19 in older people.</p>
<p>“People are tired of getting all these shots all the time,” said
Canaday, who does not serve on the committee. “We have to be careful
about over-recommending the vaccine.”</p>
<p>But there is a subset of Americans — those at higher danger of severe
illness and death — who have been asking if another dose is permissible,
said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert who
serves on a committee workgroup that has been debating the booster
question.</p>
<p>Indeed, CDC survey data suggest that group’s biggest worry about the
vaccine is whether it’s effective enough.</p>
<p>Agency officials say that among those who got the latest version of
the COVID-19 vaccine, 50% fewer will get sick after they come into
contact with the virus compared with those who didn’t get the fall
shot.</p>

Senate Republicans Block Democrats’ Bill Assuring Right to IVF</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Democrats on Wednesday failed in an attempt to rush
legislation through the U.S. Senate guaranteeing Americans’ access to in
vitro fertilization and other assisted reproductive technologies, after
an Alabama court designated frozen embryos as children.</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court ruling on February 16 that frozen embryos
should be considered children prompted at least three Alabama providers
to halt the IVF procedure that involves combining eggs and sperm in a
laboratory dish for couples having difficulty conceiving.</p>
<p>Alabama’s court ruling has raised concerns that those involved in IVF
could face prosecution because embryos that are found to be nonviable
are sometimes disposed of or used for research, and that it could
encourage other states to follow suit.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who suffered
grave injuries in combat in 2004, sought an immediate vote by the Senate
on Wednesday on passage of her “Access to Family Building Act”
legislation.</p>
<p>Her move for a vote, which required the consent of all 100 senators,
was promptly blocked by Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith.</p>
<p>“The bill before us today is a vast overreach that is full of poison
pills that goes way too far, far beyond ensuring legal access to IVF,”
Hyde-Smith said.</p>
<p>Duckworth countered that her bill simply would guarantee access to
IVF treatments and facilities “without fear of being prosecuted,” while
also shielding IVF providers and health insurance companies.</p>
<p>While many Republican officeholders have expressed discomfort with
the Alabama court ruling, the party was not ready to fall in line with
Democrats on this hot-button issue that is linked to the national debate
over women’s right to abortion.</p>
<p>Duckworth told reporters on Tuesday that she struggled for a decade
with infertility following her military service in Iraq, which prompted
her and her husband to turn to IVF. They now have two children.</p>
<p>“I have five embryos that were created (using IVF); three that were
deemed to be nonviable, would not survive,” Duckworth said.</p>
<p>She said that at the time, in 2013, her doctor told her that if
“personhood laws” regarding embryos were to be enacted, “I could be
convicted of manslaughter or murder for discarding these three eggs that
were nonviable.”</p>
<p>Reproductive rights are expected to be a major issue in this year’s
presidential and congressional campaigns, with Democrats lashing out at
both the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling overturning its landmark Roe
v. Wade case establishing a national right to abortion, as well as
subsequent state reproductive rights actions such as the one on IVF.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre
said the Republican blocking of Duckworth’s measure was
“outrageous.”</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre added that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala
Harris “will continue to fight to protect access to reproductive health
care, including IVF, and call on Congress to restore the protections of
Roe v. Wade in federal law for all women in every state.”</p>

Mexico, Guatemala Boost Cooperation to Control Migrant Arrivals at
Southern Border</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken hosted a meeting
Wednesday in Washington with top Mexican and Guatemalan officials to
discuss managing irregular migration, displacement, and expanding lawful
immigration pathways in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Blinken, joined by Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas
and other high-level U.S. officials, met with Guatemalan Foreign Affairs
Minister Carlos Ramiro Martínez, Guatemalan Minister of the Interior
Francisco José Jiménez Irungaray, and Mexican Foreign Affairs Secretary
Alicia Bárcena Ibarra. </p>
<p>The three delegations agreed on the urgency of addressing the root
causes of irregular migration, expanding more legal pathways to the
U.S., and the creation of a U.S., Mexico, and Guatemala “operational
cell” to jointly tackle migration issues.</p>
<p>“We are really here to double down on the collaboration that we have
in dealing with migration flows. We know that all of us are living in
what is genuinely a historic time.  Around the world, more people are on
the move than at any time in recorded history, and the same is true, of
course, in our own hemisphere,” Blinken said. </p>
<p>Guatemala will also host the next Los Angeles Declaration on
Migration and Protection ministerial meeting in April. Martínez said
they do not see the migration issue as a problem, but a phenomenon. </p>
<p>“And we believe that behind this, of course, there is a fundamental
task for the Guatemalan state. We are the first who must manage the
needs of our population. We must create and provide opportunities so
that our people do not migrate, so that these flows of Guatemalans
seeking opportunities do not continue to grow. So, the first task is a
task for the Guatemalan state,” Martinez said. </p>
<p>During a background call with reporters on Tuesday, a U.S. official
said Mexican and Guatemalan nationals represent the largest number of
migrants that border officers currently encounter at the Southwest
border. </p>
<p>The official added that the United States is looking forward to
deepening trilateral efforts to expand legal pathways, including for
labor migration.</p>
<p>“One of our most successful lawful pathway initiatives — in 2023, we
issued over 442,000 visas to temporary and seasonal workers. Those who
work here through labor pathways contribute to the U.S. economy and send
money back home to support friends and family and invest in their
futures,” the U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, officials from the United States and Mexico met
and set goals to make migration numbers consistent, fight human
smuggling and create a plan to discourage migrants from crossing through
the dangerous Darién Gap in Panama.</p>
<p>The meetings come as the Biden administration considers cracking down
on asylum-seekers after a record number of migrants arrived at the
U.S.-Mexico border in December. The number fell by 41% in January. </p>
<p>“The difficult paths that migrants in our continent take towards the
North to seek better and more opportunities in life is transcendental. …
These geographical circumstances mean that as countries, we face most of
the cycles of the migration process. Guatemala and Mexico are origin,
transit, destination and return,” Barcena said.</p>
<p>Immigration has become one of the leading issues in this year’s
presidential election. Former President Donald Trump, who is likely to
face President Joe Biden in November, promises to take stronger action
on it. </p>
<p>For now, Biden is going to Brownsville, Texas, on Thursday. At the
same time, Trump will be going to Eagle Pass, Texas, which is also on
the border with Mexico.</p>

Congressional Leaders Reach Deal to Avert Government Shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Democratic and Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress
on Wednesday announced they had reached a deal for advancing the 12
annual bills that fund an array of federal programs for the fiscal year
ending on Sept. 30 and could also avert government shutdowns on
Saturday. </p>
<p>The pact approved by House of Representatives and Senate leaders
would pave the way for votes on a stopgap funding bill to keep the
government operating normally through newly set March 8 and March 22
deadlines, giving lawmakers time to examine and debate the full-year
funding bills. </p>
<p>The temporary measure will be “voted on by the House and Senate this
week,” said the joint statement by House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell,
House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and the leaders of the two
chambers’ appropriations panels. </p>
<p>Republican Representative Kevin Hern told reporters the temporary
funding bill, which would be the fourth of the fiscal year that began
last Oct. 1, would be put to a House vote on Thursday. </p>
<p>If it were to fail, it would bring the federal government to the
brink of partial shutdowns early Saturday. </p>
<p>Both parties’ leaders will now work on explaining the deal to their
rank-and-file with the goal of persuading enough of them to back the
arrangement. </p>
<p>The deal would put six of the 12 funding bills on a path to passage
by March 8 with the remainder by March 22.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-know-about-dois">What do we know about DOIs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Crossref holds metadata for approximately 150 million scholarly
artifacts. These range from peer reviewed journal articles through to
scholarly books through to scientific blog posts. In fact, amid such
heterogeneity, the only singular factor that unites such items is that
they have been assigned a document object identifier (DOI); a unique
identification string that can be used to resolve to a resource
pertaining to said metadata (often, but not always, a copy of the work
identified by the metadata).
</p>
<p>
What, though, do we actually know about the state of persistence of
these links? How many DOIs resolve correctly? How many landing pages, at
the other end of the DOI resolution, contain the information that is
supposed to be there, including the title and the DOI itself? How can we
find out?
</p>
<p>
The first and seemingly most obvious way that we can obtain some of
these data is by working through the most recent sample of DOIs and
attempting to fetch metadata from each of them using a standard python
script. This involves using the httpx library to attempt to resolve each
of the DOIs to a resource, visiting that resource and seeing what the
landing page yields.
</p>
<p>
Even this is not straightforward. Landing pages can be HTML resources or
they can be PDF files, among other things. In the case of PDF files, to
detect a run of text is not simple as a single line break can be enough
to foil our search. Nonetheless, when using this strategy we find the
following statistics:
</p>
<p>
Total DOI count in sample: 5000<br> Number of HTTP 200 response:
3301*<br> Percentage of HTTP 200 responses: 66.02%<br> Number of titles
found on landing page: 1580<br> Percentage of titles found on landing
page: 31.60%<br> Number of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 1410<br> Percentage of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 28.20%<br> Number of titles and DOIs found on landing page:
929<br> Percentage of titles and DOIs found on landing page: 18.58%<br>
Number of PDFs found on landing page: 1469<br> Percentage of PDFs found
on landing page: 29.38%<br> Percent of PDFs found on landing pages that
loaded: 44.50%
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>an HTTP 200 response means that the web page loaded correctly
</p>
<p>
While these numbers look quite low, the problem here is that a large
number of scholarly publishers use Digital Rights Management techniques
on their sites that block a crawl of this type. We can use systems like
Playwright to remote control browsers to do the crawling, so that the
request looks as much like a genuine user as possible and to evade such
detection systems. However, lots of these sites detect headless browsers
(where the browser is invisible and running on a server) and block them
with a 403 Permission Denied error.
</p>
<p>
There’s
<a href="https://github.com/infosimples/detect-headless" target="_blank">a
great Github javascript suite</a> that aims to help evade headless
detection. The tests it uses are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
User Agent: in a browser running with puppeteer in headless mode, user
agent includes Headless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
App Version: same as User Agent above.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Plugins: headless browsers don’t have any plugins. So we can say that if
it has plugin it’s headful, but not otherwise since some browsers, like
Firefox, don’t have default plugins.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Plugins Prototype: check if the Plugin and PluginsArray prototype are
correct.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mime Type: similar to Plugins test, where headless browsers don’t have
any mime type
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mime Type Prototype: check if the MimeType and MimeTypeArrayprototype
are correct.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Languages: all headful browser has at least one language. So we can say
that if it has no language it’s headless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Webdriver: this property is true when running in a headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Time elapse: it pops an alert() on page and if it’s closed too fast,
means that it’s headless.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Chrome element: it’s specific for chrome browser that has an element
window.chrome.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Permission: in headless mode Notification.permission and
navigator.permissions.query report contradictory values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Devtool: puppeteer works on devtools protocol, this test checks if
devtool is present or not.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Broken Image: all browser has a default nonzero broken image size, and
this may not happen on a headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Outer Dimension: the attributes outerHeight and outerWidth have value 0
on headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Connection Rtt: The attribute navigator.connection.rtt,if present, has
value 0 on headless browser.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Mouse Move: The attributes movementX and movementY on every MouseEvent
have value 0 on headless browser.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using the stealth plugin for Playwright also allows us to evade most of
these checks. This just leaves Mouse Move and Broken Image detection,
which I thought would not outweigh all the other factors. We can also
jitter the connection with arbitrary delays so that it should appear to
be coming at random intervals, rather than a robotic crawl.
</p>
<p>
Yet the basic fact is that we are still blocked from crawling many
sites. This does not happen when we put the browser into headful mode,
so current detection techniques have clearly evolved in the past half
decade (since Detect Headless) was designed.
</p>
<p>
If, however, we run the browser in a headful mode, the results are
somewhat stunningly different:
</p>
<p>
Total DOI count in sample: 5000<br> Number of HTTP 200 response:
4852<br> Percent of HTTP 200 responses: 97.04%<br> Number of titles
found on landing page: 2547<br> Percentage of titles found on landing
page: 50.94%<br> Number of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 2424<br> Percentage of DOIs in recommended format found on landing
page: 48.48%<br> Number of titles and DOIs found on landing page:
1574<br> Percentage of titles and DOIs found on landing page: 31.48%<br>
Number of PDFs found on landing page: 2085<br> Percentage of PDFs found
on landing page: 41.70%<br> Percentage of PDFs found on landing pages
that loaded: 42.97%
</p>
<p>
Let’s talk about the resolution statistics. Other studies, looking at
general links on the web, have found a link-rot rate of about 60%-70%
over a ten-year period
<a href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?jyT6HY" target="_blank">(Lessig,
Zittrain, and Albert 2014; Stox 2022)</a>. The DOI resolution rate that
we have, with 97% of links resolving (or a 3% link-rot rate), is far
better and more robust than a web link in general.
</p>
<p>
Is 3% a good or a bad number? It’s more robust than the web in general,
but it still means that for every 100 DOIs, just under 3 will fail to
resolve. We also cannot tell whether these DOIs are resolving to the
correct target, except by using the metadata detection metrics (are the
title and DOI on the landing page, which we could only detect at a far
lower rate). It is entirely possible for a website to resolve with an
HTTP 200 (OK) response, but for the page in question to be something
very different to what the user expected, a phenomenon dubbed content
drift. A good example is domain hijacking, where a domain name expires
and spam companies buy them up. These still resolve to a web page, but
instead of an article on RNA, for a hypothetical example, the user gets
adverts for rubber welding hose. That said, other studies are also prone
to this and there is no guarantee that content drift doesn’t affect a
huge proportion of supposedly good links in the other studies, too.
</p>
<p>
Of course, one of the most frustrating elements of this exercise is
having to work around publisher blocks on content when visiting using a
server-only robot script. It’s important for us periodically to monitor
the uptime rate of the DOI system. We also recognise, though, that
publishers want to block malicious traffic. However, we can’t perform
our monitoring in an easy, automatic way if headless scripts are blocked
from resolving DOIs and visiting their respective landing pages. This is
not even a call for open access; it’s just saying that current anti-bot
techniques, sometimes implemented for legitimate reasons, stifle our
ability to know the landscape. Even if the bot resolved a DOI to just a
paywall, it would be easier for us to monitor this than it is now.
Similarly, CAPTCHA systems such as Cloudflare that would seem to offer
an easy way to distinguish between humans (good) and robots (bad) can
make life very difficult at the monitoring end. We would certainly be
grateful for any proposed solution that could help us to work around
these mechanisms.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
The context in which I wanted to know this information was so that we
can take a snapshot of a page and then, at a later stage, determine
whether it is down or has changed substantially. To do this, we are
developing
<a href="https://gitlab.com/crossref/labs/shelob/" target="_blank">Shelob</a>,
an experimental content drift spider system; that’s what we’ve used so
far to conduct this analysis. Over time, Shelob will evolve, we hope, to
give us a way to detect when content has drifted or gone offline. If,
however, we can’t detect whether an endpoint is good in the first place,
then we likewise cannot detect when things have gone wrong. On the other
hand, if, when we first visit, we find the DOI and title on the landing
page, but at some future point this degrades, we might be able to say
with some confidence that the original has died. I, personally, would
encourage publishers not to block automated crawlers, because it’s good
when we can determine these types of figures.

id="installing-postgresql-on-sles-15-just-got-easier-and-better">Installing
PostgreSQL on SLES 15 just got easier – and better!</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-29, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
<a href="https://zypp.postgresql.org">The PostgreSQL RPM repository for
SuSE Enterprise Linux</a> has supported SLES for quite some time. We
followed the usual conventions and used zypper addrepo … to add the
repositories.
</p>
<p>
This method mostly works, however it is (now, was…) not easy for us to
make modifications to the repository files. This led to multiple issues
in the past like not being able to add a common repository, not being
able to archive old repos properly or not being able to change
signatures, etc. We do not have this problem in the
<a href="https://yum.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL YUM/DNF repository</a>
because it already has
<a href="https://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages/">repository RPMs</a> .
</p>
<p>
Good news: <a href="https://zypp.postgresql.org/howtozypp/">We now have
the same infrastructure in the SLES 15</a> ! Please note that this will
have a direct effect on the directory layout so the package locations
will change for some of the packages
(i.e. <a href="https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/zypp/common/">“common”
packages</a>) . It means all of the SLES 15 users will need to switch to
the new repository RPMs at the earliest convenience to receive the
updates or even install many of the packages.
</p>
<p>
As an unintentional good side effect of this change,
<a href="https://zypp.postgresql.org/news/new-repo-extra-packages/">“extras”
repository is now available also on SLES 15</a> . This extras repo
provides packages to support Patroni.
</p>
<p>
Here is a quick FAQ:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
How can I switch to the new repository RPM?
</p>
<p>
<code>zypper install
https://download.postgresql.org/pub/repos/zypp/reporpms/SLES-15-x86_64/pgdg-suse-repo-latest.noarch.rpm</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I am a new user. How does it affect me?
</p>
<p>
Not at all. Just follow the instructions and install PostgreSQL as
usual: <code>https://zypp.postgresql.org/repopackages/</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Can I disable specific PostgreSQL releases?
</p>
<p>
Yes. You can run this command to disable PostgreSQL 12 repo:
</p>
<p>
<code>zypper mr -d pgdg-12</code>
</p>
</li>
