Clooney, Brad Pitt disappointed their new film skips cinemas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Venice, Italy — Hollywood heavyweights George Clooney and Brad Pitt
admit they are disappointed their latest comedy “Wolfs” is not getting a
broad cinema release and instead heading almost straight onto Apple
TV.</p>
<p>“It is a bummer,” Clooney said on Sunday, adding that television
streamers, such as Apple AAPL.O, were nevertheless vital to the future
of filmmaking, presenting actors with opportunities and generating
bigger audiences for their work.</p>
<p>“Streaming, we need it, our industry needs this,” he said.</p>
<p>Written and directed by Jon Watts, “Wolfs” is an old-fashioned crime
caper with Clooney and Pitt playing lone-wolf professional fixers who
are forced to work together with comically unfortunate consequences.
 </p>
<p>Apple originally signaled it would place the film in a large number
of cinemas before the TV release, but instead opted to show it briefly
in a restricted number of U.S. movie theatres and then run it on its
global TV service.</p>
<p>“We’ll always be romantic about the theatrical experience. At the
same time, I love the existence of the streamers because we get to see
more story, we get to see more talent, it gets more eyes,” said Pitt.
“It’s a delicate balance right now and it’ll right itself.”</p>
<p>Asked what it meant if two of the biggest names in the business could
not get a broad cinema release, as they had requested, Clooney quipped:
“Clearly we’re declining.”</p>
<p>Sixteen years after last appearing together in 2008’s Coen brothers’
comedy “Burn After Reading,” Pitt and Clooney said they jumped at the
chance to reunite when they read Watts’ script for “Wolfs.”</p>
<p>“I got to say, just as I get older, just working with the people that
I just really enjoy spending time with has really become important to
me,” said Pitt, who turned 60 last year.</p>
<p>In a news conference full of light-hearted banter, Clooney, said
Pitt, was fortunate still to be offered parts. “He’s 74 years-old and
he’s very lucky at this age to still be working.”</p>
<p>On a more serious note, he denied a New York Times story in August
that said both he and Pitt had been paid more than $35 million each to
appear in the film.</p>
<p>“I’m only saying that because I think it’s bad for our industry if
that’s what people think is the standard bearer for salaries. I think
that’s a terrible thing. It will make it impossible to make a film,” he
said.</p>
<p>“Wolfs” is showing out of competition at the Venice Film Festival,
which runs until Sept. 7.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Telegram doesn’t hold up to the promise of being private, nor secure.
The end-to-end encryption is opt-in, only applies to one-on-one
conversations and uses a controversial ‘homebrewn’ encryption algorithm.
The rest of this article outlines some of the fundamentally broken
aspects of Telegram. ↫ h3artbl33d Telegram is not a secure messenger,
nor is it a platform you should want to be on. Chats are not encrypted
by default, and are stored in plain text on Telegram’s server. Only
chats between two (not more!) people who also happen to both be online
at that time can be “encrypted”. In addition, the quotation marks
highlight another massive issue with Telegram: its “encryption” is
non-standard, home-grown, and countless security researchers have warned
against relying on it. Telegram’s issues go even further than this,
though. The application also copies your contacts to its servers and
keeps them there, they’ve got a “People nearby” feature that shares
location data, and so much more. The linked article does a great job of
listing the litany of problems Telegram has, backed up by sources and
studies, and these alone should convince anyone to not use Telegram for
anything serious. And that’s even before we talk about Telegram’s utter
disinterest in stopping the highly illegal activities that openly take
place on its platform, from selling drugs, down to far more shocking and
dangerous activities like sharing revenge pron, CSAM, and more. Telegram
has a long history of not giving a single iota about shuttering groups
that share and promote such material, leaving victims of such heinous
crimes out in the cold. Don’t use Telegram. A much better alternative is
Signal, and hell, even WhatsApp, of all things, is a better choice.</p>

<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>If you’re reading this, you did a good job surviving another month,
and that means we’ve got another monthly update from the Servo project,
the Rust-based browser engine originally started by Mozilla. The major
new feature this month is tabbed browsing in the Servo example browser,
as well as extensive improvements for Servo on Windows.
Servo-the-browser now has a redesigned toolbar and tabbed browsing! This
includes a slick new tab page, taking advantage of a new API that lets
Servo embedders register custom protocol handlers. ↫ Servo’s blog Servo
now runs better on Windows, with keyboard navigation now
fixed, –output to PNG also fixed, and fixes for some font- and
GPU-related bugs, which were causing misaligned glyphs with incorrect
colors on servo.org and duckduckgo.com, and corrupted images on
wikipedia.org. Of course, that’s not at all, as there’s also the usual
massive list of improved standards support, new APIs, improvements to
some of the developer tools (including massive improvements in Windows
build times), and a huge number of fixed bugs.</p>

hotel workers strike in Boston, Greenwich as contract negotiations
stall</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — About 1,070 hotel workers in the U.S. cities of Boston and
Greenwich are on strike after contract talks with hotel operators
Marriott International MAR.O, Hilton Worldwide HLT.N and Hyatt Hotels
H.N stalled, the Unite Here union said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The strikes in Boston and Greenwich will last three days, the union
said, adding that more hotel workers in different cities are expected to
walk off the job across the U.S. throughout the Labor Day holiday
weekend.</p>
<p>Unite Here, which represents workers in hotels, casinos and airports
across the United States and Canada, said frustrated workers may strike
in major destinations including San Francisco and Seattle as they
struggle to agree with hotel operators on wages and on reversing
pandemic-era job cuts.</p>
<p>“Strikes have also been authorized and could begin at any time in
Baltimore, Honolulu, Kauai, New Haven, Oakland, Providence, San Diego,
San Francisco, San Jose, and Seattle,” Unite Here said in a
statement.</p>
<p>A total of 40,000 Unite Here hotel workers in more than 20 cities are
working under contracts that expire this year. About 15,000 of those
workers have authorized strikes in 12 markets from Boston to
Honolulu.</p>
<p>Workers have been in negotiations for new four-year contracts since
May.</p>
<p>“We’re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,”
Unite Here President Gwen Mills said.</p>
<p>“We won’t accept a ‘new normal’ where hotel companies profit by
cutting their offerings to guests and abandoning their commitments to
workers,” Mills added.</p>
<p>Unite Here workers in 2023 won record contracts in Los Angeles
following rolling strikes and in Detroit after a 47-day strike.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, casino operators MGM MGM.N, Caesars CZR.O and Wynn
WYNN.O resorts reached an agreement in November to avert a strike with
40,000 hospitality workers days before a deadline that would have
crippled the Vegas Strip.</p>

<h2 id="pickleball-picks-away-at-american-tennis">Pickleball picks away
at American tennis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Does American tennis have a pickleball problem?</p>
<p>Even as the U.S. Open opened this week with more than a million fans
expected for the sport’s biggest showcase, the game’s leaders are being
forced to confront a devastating fact — the nation’s fastest-growing
racket sport (or sport of any kind) is not tennis but pickleball, which
has seen participation boom 223% in the past three years.</p>
<p>“Quite frankly, it’s obnoxious to hear that pickleball noise,” U.S.
Tennis Association President Dr. Brian Hainline grumbled at a recent
state-of-the-game news conference, bemoaning the distinctive pock, pock,
pock of pickleball points.</p>
<p>Pickleball, an easy-to-play mix of tennis and ping pong using paddles
and a wiffleball, has quickly soared from nearly nothing to 13.6 million
U.S. players in just a few years, leading tennis purists to fear a day
when it could surpass tennis’ 23.8 million players. And most troubling
is that pickleball’s rise has often come at the expense of thousands of
tennis courts encroached upon or even replaced by smaller pickleball
courts.</p>
<p>“When you see an explosion of a sport and it starts potentially
eroding into your sport, then, yes, you’re concerned,” Hainline said in
an interview with The Associated Press. “That erosion has come in our
infrastructure. … A lot of pickleball advocates just came in and said,
‘We need these tennis courts.’ It was a great, organic grassroots
movement but it was a little anti-tennis.”</p>
<p>Some tennis governing bodies in other countries have embraced
pickleball and other racket sports under the more-the-merrier belief
they could lead more players to the mothership of tennis. France’s
tennis federation even set up a few pickleball courts at this year’s
French Open to give top players and fans a chance to try it out.</p>
<p>But the USTA has taken a decidedly different approach. Nowhere at the
U.S. Open’s Billie Jean King National Tennis Center is there any such
demonstration court, exhibition match or any other nod to pickleball or
its possible crossover appeal.</p>
<p>In fact, the USTA is flipping the script on pickleball with an
ambitious launch of more than 400 pilot programs across the country to
broaden the reach of an easier-to-play, smaller-court version of tennis
called “red ball tennis.” Backers say it’s the ideal way for people of
all ages to get into tennis and the best place to try it is (wait for
it) on pickleball courts.</p>
<p>“You can begin tennis at any age,” USTA’s Hainline said. “We believe
that when you do begin this great sport of tennis, it’s probably best to
begin it on a shorter court with a larger, low-compression red ball.
What’s an ideal short court? A pickleball court.”</p>
<p>And instead of the plasticky plink of a pickleball against a flat
paddle, Hainline said, striking a fuzzy red tennis ball with a stringed
racket allows for a greater variety of strokes and “just a beautiful
sound.” Players can either stick with red ball tennis or advance through
a progression of bouncier balls to full-court tennis.</p>
<p>“Not to put it down,” Hainline said of pickleball, “but compared to
tennis … seriously?”</p>
<p>So what does the head of the nation’s pickleball governing body have
to say about such comments and big tennis’ plans to plant the seeds of
its growth, at least in part, on pickleball courts?</p>
<p>“I don’t like it but there is so much going on with pickleball, so
many good things, I’m going to stick to what I can control, harnessing
the growth and supporting this game,” said Pickleball USA CEO Mike
Nealy.</p>
<p>Among the positive signs, Nealy said, is the continuing construction
of new pickleball courts across the country, raising the total to more
than 50,000. There’s also growing investment in the game at clubs built
in former big-box retail stores, pro leagues with such backers as Tom
Brady, LeBron James and Drake, and the emergence of “dink-and-drink”
establishments that tap into the social aspect of the game by allowing
friends to enjoy pickleball, beer, wine and food under the same
roof.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it needs to be one or the other or a competition,”
Nealy said of pickleball and tennis. “You’re certainly going to have the
inherent frictions in communities when tennis people don’t feel that
they’re getting what they want. … They’re different games but I think
they are complimentary. There’s plenty of room for both sports to be
very successful.”</p>
<p>Top-ranked American tennis player Taylor Fritz agreed. “There are
some people in the tennis world that are just absolute pickleball
haters, and that’s fine. But for me, I don’t really have an issue with
pickleball. I like playing sometimes. … I don’t see any reason why both
of them can’t exist.”</p>

id="newborn-rattlesnakes-at-colorado-mega-den-make-their-live-debut">Newborn
rattlesnakes at Colorado ‘mega den’ make their live debut</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHEYENNE, Wyoming — A “mega den” of hundreds of rattlesnakes in
Colorado is getting even bigger now that late summer is here and babies
are being born.</p>
<p>Thanks to livestream video, scientists studying the den on a craggy
hillside in Colorado are learning more about these enigmatic — and often
misunderstood — reptiles. They’re observing as the youngsters, called
pups, slither over and between adult females on lichen-encrusted
rocks.</p>
<p>The public can watch too on the Project RattleCam website and help
with important work including how to tell the snakes apart. Since
researchers put their remote camera online in May, several snakes have
become known in a chat room and to scientists by names including
“Woodstock,” “Thea” and “Agent 008.”</p>
<p>The live feed, which draws as many as 500 people at a time online, on
Thursday showed a tangle of baby snakes with tiny nubs for rattles. They
have a lot of growing to do: A rattlesnake adds a rattle segment each
time it sheds its skin a couple times a year, on average.</p>
<p>The project is a collaboration between California Polytechnic State
University in San Luis Obispo, snake removal company Central Coast Snake
Services and Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>By involving the public, the scientists hope to dispel the idea that
rattlesnakes are usually fierce and dangerous. In fact, experts say they
rarely bite unless threatened or provoked and often are just the
opposite. </p>
<p>Rattlesnakes are not only among the few reptiles that care for their
young. They even care for the young of others. The adults protect and
lend body heat to pups from birth until they enter hibernation in
mid-autumn, said Max Roberts, a CalPoly graduate student researcher.</p>
<p>“We regularly see what we like to call ‘babysitting,’ pregnant
females that we can visibly see have not given birth, yet are kind of
guarding the newborn snakes,” Roberts said Wednesday.</p>
<p>As many as 2,000 rattlesnakes spend the winter at the location on
private land, which the researchers are keeping secret to discourage
trespassers. Once the weather warms, only pregnant females remain while
the others disperse to nearby territory.</p>
<p>This year, the scientists keeping watch over the Colorado site have
observed the rattlesnakes coil up and catch water to drink from the cups
formed by their bodies. They’ve also seen how the snakes react to birds
swooping in to try to grab a scaly meal.</p>
<p>The highlight of summer is in late August and early September when
the rattlesnakes give birth over a roughly two-week period.</p>
<p>“As soon as they’re born, they know how to move into the sun or into
the shade to regulate their body temperature,” Roberts said.</p>
<p>There are 36 species of rattlesnakes, most of which inhabit the U.S.
They range across nearly all states and are especially common in the
Southwest. Those being studied now are prairie rattlesnakes, which can
be found in much of the central and western U.S. and into Canada and
Mexico.</p>
<p>Like other pit viper species but unlike most snakes, rattlesnakes
don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young. Eight is an
average-size brood, with the number depending on the snake’s size,
according to Roberts.</p>
<p>Roberts is studying how temperature changes and ultraviolet sunlight
affect snake behavior. Another graduate student, Owen Bachhuber, is
studying the family and social relationships between rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>The researchers watch the live feed all day.</p>
<p>“We are interested in studying the natural behavior of rattlesnakes,
free from human disturbance. What do rattlesnakes actually do when we’re
not there?” Roberts said.</p>
<p>Now that the Rocky Mountain summer is cooling, some males have been
returning. By November, the camera running on solar and battery power
will be turned off until next spring, when the snakes will re-emerge
from their “mega den.”</p>

transfers ‘some aircraft’ used by former Afghan army to Uzbekistan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States has handed over to the Uzbek
government possession of aircraft that former Afghan air force personnel
flew to Uzbekistan after the Taliban takeover of Kabul in 2021.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department told VOA on Thursday
that the ownership of “some aircraft” was transferred to Uzbekistan as
part of the Department of Defense’s Excess Defense Articles program.</p>
<p>“This transfer was agreed in the context of our strong bilateral
cooperation on counterterrorism, counternarcotics and enhanced border
security,” the spokesperson told VOA in an email, without saying how
many aircraft were transferred to the Uzbek government.</p>
<p>The fate of aircraft that were flown to Uzbekistan after the fall of
Afghanistan into the hands of the Taliban has been a bone of contention
between the Taliban and Uzbekistan for three years.</p>
<p>Afghan air force personnel flew about 46 aircraft — 22 military
planes and 24 helicopters — to Uzbekistan as the government in
Afghanistan collapsed in the face of the Taliban’s advances in August
2021.  </p>
<p>The Taliban, who consider the aircraft to be Afghan property,
objected to the handover of the aircraft to Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Defense [of the Taliban] clearly declares that the
United States has no right to donate or confiscate the property of the
Afghan people,” the spokesperson of the Taliban’s Ministry of Defense
said in an audio message sent to media this week.</p>
<p>The Taliban spokesperson also called on Uzbekistan to make a
“reasonable decision” to return the aircraft to the Taliban.</p>
<p>Local media in Uzbekistan reported last week that the U.S. ambassador
said the aircraft had already been transferred.</p>
<p>Tashkent has not commented yet on the transfer. However, Uzbek
authorities previously said that the aircraft belonged to the United
States because the U.S. government paid for them and that it would not
return the military equipment to the Taliban.</p>
<p>Tashkent-Taliban relations</p>
<p>Alisher Hamidov, an expert on Central Asia, told VOA that the
transfer of aircraft to Uzbekistan may complicate the relations between
Tashkent and the Taliban.</p>
<p>“The situation with the planes may now endanger Uzbekistan’s
diplomatic relations,” he said, adding that Tashkent has been playing
mediator between Kabul and other countries over the past three
years.</p>
<p>“The main goal was to bring Afghanistan [Taliban] to the
international arena, restore relations and, of course, strengthen
Uzbekistan’s economy and foreign policy,” Hamidov added.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan has cultivated close relations with the Taliban, though it
does not officially recognize the Taliban’s government in
Afghanistan.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Taliban’s deputy prime minister, Abdul Ghani
Baradar, attended the inauguration ceremony of the Termez International
Trade Center in Uzbekistan’s border town of Termez.</p>
<p>On August 17, the prime minister of Uzbekistan, Abdulla Aripov,
visited Kabul and signed 35 trade and investment agreements valued at
$2.5 billion.</p>

id="netanyahu-vows-to-settle-the-score-with-hamas-after-bodies-of-six-hostages-are-found">Netanyahu
vows to ‘settle the score’ with Hamas after bodies of six hostages are
found</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Sunday to
intensify the fight with Hamas after the Israeli military recovered the
bodies of six hostages, all of whom were apparently shot to death by the
militants just as troops were zeroing in on their location in Gaza.</p>
<p>“Those who kill hostages do not want an agreement” for a Gaza
cease-fire, Netanyahu said in a statement, telling Hamas leaders that
“we will hunt you down, we will catch you and we will settle the
score.”</p>
<p>A military spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, told reporters
in a briefing, “According to our initial estimation, they were brutally
murdered by Hamas terrorists a short time before we reached them.” They
were found in a tunnel in the southern city of Rafah.</p>
<p>Netanyahu also accused Hamas of carrying out a shooting attack
earlier on Sunday that killed three police officers near the city of
Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has not claimed
responsibility for the attack but called it a “heroic operation by the
resistance.”</p>
<p>Netanyahu said, “We are fighting on all fronts against a cruel enemy
who wants to murder us all. The fact that Hamas continues to commit
atrocities such as those it committed on October 7 obliges us to do
everything we can to ensure that it can no longer do so.”</p>
<p>The Israeli military said the West Bank attackers fired at a vehicle
at the checkpoint near Hebron. “Security forces have begun to search for
the terrorists,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>An Israeli military spokesman, Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, told CNN’s
“State of the Union” show that Israeli forces are continuing to search
tunnels near where the bodies of the hostages were found, only a
kilometer from where a living hostage, Qaid Farhan Alkadi, a member of
the Bedouin community in southern Israel, was rescued last week.</p>
<p>Oma Neutra, the mother of another hostage, Omer Neutra-Oma, said on
CNN, “It’s time for the leaders to get this done,” to reach a cease-fire
to halt nearly 11 months of fighting in Gaza precipitated by the October
7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture
of about 250 hostages.</p>
<p>“Enough is enough,” she said.</p>
<p>The Israeli counteroffensive has killed nearly 41,000 Palestinians in
Gaza, most of them women and children, according to Gaza health
officials, while the Israeli military says the death toll includes
several thousand Hamas combatants.</p>
<p>Israel says it believes 101 Israeli and foreign hostages remain in
Gaza, but about one-third of them is believed to be dead, while the fate
of the others is not known.</p>
<p>Senior Hamas officials said that Israel, in its refusal to sign a
cease-fire agreement, was to blame for the newest deaths.</p>
<p>“Netanyahu is responsible for the killing of Israeli prisoners,”
senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters. “The Israelis should
choose between Netanyahu and the deal.”</p>
<p>Hamas has offered to release the hostages in return for an end to the
war, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and the release of dozens of
Palestinian prisoners, including high-profile militants, jailed by
Israel.</p>
<p>The Hostage Families Forum called on Netanyahu to take responsibility
and explain what was holding up an agreement.</p>
<p>“They were all murdered in the last few days, after surviving almost
11 months of abuse, torture, and starvation in Hamas captivity. The
delay in signing the deal has led to their deaths and those of many
other hostages,” it said.</p>
<p>Families of the hostages called for a nationwide Israeli general
strike to try to increase pressure on Netanyahu to reach a
cease-fire.</p>
<p>Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid also called for a “general
strike.”</p>
<p>“They were alive, but Netanyahu and his cabinet of death decided not
to save them,” he wrote on his Facebook page. “There are still hostages
alive. We can still make a deal.”</p>
<p>Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called on the government to reverse a
decision last Thursday to keep Israeli forces in the Philadelphi
Corridor along the border with Egypt, a key point of contention in
negotiations for a Gaza cease-fire.</p>
<p>“The cabinet must gather immediately and reverse the decision made on
Thursday,” Gallant said in a statement. “We must bring back the hostages
that are still being held by Hamas.” Gallant and Netanyahu got into a
shouting match over the corridor issue, but other security officials
sided with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, who has closely followed the fate of the
hostages, said the six bodies found in the Gaza tunnel included
Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin. Biden said he was “devastated and
outraged.”</p>
<p>“Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working
around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining
hostages,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Goldberg-Polin, 23, was captured at a music festival near the Gaza
border and appeared in a video released by Hamas in late April.</p>
<p>Earlier, speaking to reporters at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware
vacation retreat, Biden said he was “still optimistic” about reaching a
cease-fire deal to stop the conflict, adding, “People are continuing to
meet.”</p>

and Agence France-Presse.</p>

id="family-confirms-death-of-israeli-american-hostage-hersh-goldberg-polin">Family
confirms death of Israeli-American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM — The family of Israeli-American hostage Hersh
Goldberg-Polin announced the young man’s death early Sunday, ending a
relentless campaign by his parents to rescue him that included meetings
with world leaders and an address to the Democratic convention last
month.</p>
<p>Goldberg-Polin, 23, was seized by militants at a music festival in
southern Israel on October 7. The native of Berkeley, California, lost
part of his left arm to a grenade in the attack. In April, a
Hamas-issued video showed him, his left hand missing and clearly
speaking under duress, sparking new protests in Israel urging the
government to do more to secure his and others’ freedom.</p>
<p>Israel’s announcement is bound to bring urgent new calls for Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach a deal to bring home remaining
hostages. The Israeli leader has taken a tough line in negotiations and
repeatedly said that military pressure is needed to bring home the
hostages. According to Israeli media, he has feuded with top security
officials who have said a deal should be reached urgently.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, who had met with the parents, said he was
“devastated and outraged.”</p>
<p>“It is as tragic as it is reprehensible,” he said. “Make no mistake,
Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes. And we will keep working around
the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining
hostages.”</p>
<p>The family issued a statement early Sunday, hours after the Israeli
army said it had located bodies in Gaza.</p>
<p>“With broken hearts, the Goldberg-Polin family is devastated to
announce the death of their beloved son and brother, Hersh,” it said.
“The family thanks you all for your love and support and asks for
privacy at this time.”</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the army, details on the exact
circumstances of his death or identities of other bodies recovered.</p>
<p>Asked about the case earlier on Saturday, Biden said bodies were
still being identified and that families were being notified. But he
called for an end to the war and said cease-fire efforts were
progressing.</p>
<p>“I think we’re on (the) verge of having an agreement,” he said as he
left church in Delaware. “It’s just time to end. It’s time to finish
it.”</p>
<p>Goldberg-Polin’s parents, U.S.-born immigrants to Israel, became
perhaps the most high-profile relatives of hostages on the international
stage. They met with Biden, Pope Francis and others and addressed the
United Nations, urging the release of all hostages.</p>
<p>On August 21, his parents addressed a hushed hall at the Democratic
National Convention — after sustained applause and chants of “bring him
home.”</p>
<p>“This is a political convention. But needing our only son — and all
of the cherished hostages — home is not a political issue. It is a
humanitarian issue,” said his father, Jon Polin. His mother, Rachel, who
bowed her head during the ovation and touched her chest, said “Hersh, if
you can hear us, we love you, stay strong, survive.”</p>
<p>Both wore stickers with the number 320, representing the number of
days their son had been held. It had long become part of a morning
ritual — tear a new piece of tape, write down another day.</p>
<p>“I find it so remarkable how nauseating it is every single time,’’
Rachel Goldberg-Polin told The Associated Press in January, ahead of the
100-day mark.”And it’s good. I don’t want to get used to it. I don’t
want anybody to get used to the fact that these people are
missing.’’</p>
<p>She asked other people around the world to take up the ritual, too,
not only for her son, who moved to Israel with his family when he was 7,
but for the other hostages and their families.</p>
<p>She and her husband sought to keep their son and the others held from
being reduced to numbers, describing Hersh as a music and soccer lover
and traveler with plans to attend university since his military service
had ended. At events she often addressed her son directly in the hope he
could hear her, urging him to live another day.</p>
<p>Some 250 hostages were taken on October 7. Before the military’s
announcement of the latest discovery of bodies, Israel said it believed
108 hostages were still held in Gaza and about one-third of them were
dead. In late August, the Israeli military recovered the bodies of six
hostages in southern Gaza.</p>
<p>Eight hostages have been rescued by Israeli forces, the most recent
found on Tuesday. Most of the rest were freed during a weeklong
cease-fire in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians
imprisoned by Israel.</p>
<p>Two previous Israeli operations to free hostages killed scores of
Palestinians. Hamas says several hostages have been killed in Israeli
airstrikes and failed rescue attempts. Israeli troops mistakenly killed
three Israelis who escaped captivity in December.</p>

<h2 id="mississippi-bus-crash-kills-7-injures-dozens">Mississippi bus
crash kills 7, injures dozens</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BOVINA, Mississippi — Seven people were killed and dozens were
injured in Mississippi after a commercial bus overturned on Interstate
20 Saturday morning, according to the Mississippi Highway Patrol. </p>
<p>Six passengers were pronounced dead at the scene and another died at
a hospital, according to a news release. The bus was traveling west when
it left the highway near Bovina in Warren County and flipped over. No
other vehicle was involved. </p>
<p>The crash was caused by tire failure, the National Transportation
Safety Board said on the social media platform known as X. The bus was
operated by Autobuses Regiomontanos based in Laredo, Texas. A woman who
answered the phone at the company said it was aware of the crash, but
she didn’t answer questions or provide her name. </p>
<p>The transit company says it has 20 years of experience providing
cross-border trips between 100 destinations in Mexico and the United
States. Its website promotes “a modern fleet of buses that receive daily
maintenance,” and offers “trips with a special price for workers.” </p>
<p>The dead included a 6-year-old boy and his 16-year-old sister,
according to Warren County Coroner Doug Huskey. They were identified by
their mother. Authorities were working to identify the other victims, he
said. </p>
<p>Thirty-seven passengers were taken to hospitals in Vicksburg and
Jackson. The department is continuing its investigation and hasn’t
released the names of the deceased. No other information was immediately
provided.</p>

id="heres-22-examples-of-google-employees-trying-to-avoid-creating-evidence-for-court">Here’s
22 examples of Google employees trying to avoid creating evidence for
court</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>In its antitrust case against Google, the Federal Government filed a
list of chats it had obtained that show Google employees explicitly
asking each other to turn off a chat history feature to discuss
sensitive subjects, showing repeatedly that Google workers understood
they should try to avoid creating a paper trail of some of their
activities.  The filing came following a hearing in which judge Leonie
Brinkema ripped Google for “destroyed” evidence while considering a
filing from the Department of Justice asking the court to find “adverse
interference” against Google, which would allow the court to assume it
purposefully destroyed evidence. Previous filings, including in the Epic
Games v Google lawsuit and this current antitrust case, have also shown
Google employees purposefully turning history off. ↫ Seamus Hughes The
fact that corporations break the law, and lie, cheat, and scam their way
to the top is not something particularly shocking, nor will it surprise
anyone. I can barely even get angry about it anymore – birds gotta eat,
fish gotta swim, corpos gotta break the law, that sort of thing. It’s
just an inevitability of reality, a law of nature. You know it, I know
it, the whole world knows it. No, what really upsets me is just how
easily they get away with it, and even if they do get punished, any
fines or other forms of punishment are so utterly disproportionately
mild compared to the crimes committed. It’s incredibly rare for anyone
responsible for corporate crime to ever face any serious punishment, let
alone jail time, and even in the rare cases where they do, they usually
have some stock options or whatever left over from their employment
contract that will ensure a lavishly wealthy lifestyle. Fines levied
against corporations as a whole are usually so low they’re just a minor
cost of doing business, to the point where one has to wonder why they’re
even being levied at all. Compare this to us normal folks, and the
differences couldn’t be more stark. Whenever we’re accidentally late on
some small bill, we get fined automatically, with very little recourse.
We get a speeding ticket automatically in the mail because we drove 5
km/h over the speed limit. Our tax agencies are stupidly effective and
efficient at screwing you over for that small side hustle selling crap
on eBay. And rarely do we have any effective, efficient recourse. And
these things can quickly spiral out of control when you’re already
living paycheck to paycheck – being poor is really, really expensive.
And let’s not even get into how much worse any of this is if you’re part
of a minority, like being black in the US, or of North-African descent
in Europe. In this case, the illegal activities of Google and its
executies and employees is on such clear display, and yet, few, if any,
will suffer any consequences for them. If you ever wonder why so many
regular people flock to political extremes, it’s exactly this kind of
deep unfairness and inequality that lies at its roots. It’s dispiriting,
demoralising, and disheartening, and primes the pumps for
disenfranchisement with society, and thus the search for alternatives,
upon which extremists pray. We either stop our continual slide into
corporatism, or our societies will fall.</p>

id="border-arrests-expected-to-rise-in-august-5-month-drop-might-have-ended">Border
arrests expected to rise in August; 5-month drop might have ended</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>san diego, california — Arrests for illegal border crossings from
Mexico during August are expected to rise slightly from July, officials
said, likely ending five straight months of declines. </p>
<p>Authorities made about 54,000 arrests through Thursday, which, at the
current rate, would bring the August total to about 58,000 when the
month ends Saturday, according to two U.S. Customs and Border Protection
officials. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss
information that has not been publicly released. </p>
<p>The tally suggests that arrests could be bottoming out after being
halved from a record 250,000 in December, a decline that U.S. officials
largely attributed to Mexican authorities increasing enforcement within
their borders. Arrests were more than halved again after Democratic
President Joe Biden invoked authority to temporarily suspend asylum
processing in June. Arrests plunged to 56,408 in July, a 46-month low
that changed little in August. </p>
<p>Asked about the latest numbers, the Homeland Security Department
released a statement by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calling on Congress
to support failed legislation that would have suspended asylum
processing when crossings reached certain thresholds, reshaped how
asylum claims are decided to relieve bottlenecked immigration courts and
added Border Patrol agents, among other things. </p>
<p>Republicans including presidential nominee Donald Trump opposed the
bill, calling it insufficient. </p>
<p>“Thanks to action taken by the Biden-Harris Administration, the hard
work of our DHS personnel and our partnerships with other countries in
the region and around the world, we continue to see the lowest number of
encounters at our Southwest border since September 2020,” Mayorkas said
Saturday. </p>
<p>The steep drop from last year’s highs is welcome news for the White
House and the Democrats’ White House nominee, Vice President Kamala
Harris, despite criticism from many immigration advocates that asylum
restrictions go too far and from those favoring more enforcement who say
Biden’s new and expanded legal paths to entry are far too generous. </p>
<p>More than 765,000 people entered the United States legally through
the end of July using an online appointment app called CBP One and an
additional 520,000 from four nationalities were allowed through airports
with financial sponsors. The airport-based offer to people from Cuba,
Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela — all nationalities that are difficult to
deport — was briefly suspended in July to address concerns about fraud
by U.S. financial sponsors. </p>
<p>San Diego, California, again had the most arrests among the Border
Patrol’s nine sectors on the Mexican border in August, followed by El
Paso, Texas, and Tucson, Arizona, though the three busiest corridors
were close, the officials said. Arrests of Colombians and Ecuadoreans
fell, which officials attributed to deportation flights to those South
American countries. Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras were the top three
nationalities.</p>

calls on Trump to debate with mics ‘on the whole time’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee in
the November 5 U.S. presidential election, on Saturday called on her
Republican rival, Donald Trump, to debate her with their microphones
switched on throughout the event.</p>
<p>Harris and the former president have agreed to a debate, hosted by
ABC News, on September 10.</p>
<p>“Donald Trump is surrendering to his advisors who won’t allow him to
debate with a live microphone. If his own team doesn’t have confidence
in him, the American people definitely can’t,” Harris said in a post on
social media platform X.</p>
<p>“We are running for President of the United States. Let’s debate in a
transparent way with the microphones on the whole time.”</p>
<p>Trump has said that he preferred to have his microphone kept on and
that he did not like it muted during the last debate against
then-contender President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>So-called “hot mics” can help or hurt political candidates, catching
off-hand comments that sometimes were not meant for the public. Muted
microphones also prevent the debaters from interrupting their
opponent.</p>
<p>A representative for ABC did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>The debate would be the first time Harris and Trump face off since
Biden dropped out of the presidential race following a poor performance
at a CNN debate in June that raised doubts about his mental acuity.</p>
<p>Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz and Republican vice
presidential nominee JD Vance have agreed to an October 1 debate on CBS
News.</p>

<h2 id="high-rents-are-forcing-small-businesses-into-tough-choices">High
rents are forcing small businesses into tough choices</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — While many costs have come down for small businesses,
rents remain high and in some cases are still rising, forcing many
owners into some uncomfortable decisions.</p>
<p>“Every time the rent goes up, we have to raise prices, to keep up
with the cost,” said Adelita Valentine, owner of HairFreek Barbers in
Los Angeles. “But with the cost of living, it makes it difficult on our
customers.”</p>
<p>Other owners are choosing to be late on payments or seeking out new
locations where the rent is lower. A few are pushing back against their
landlord.</p>
<p>Although inflation is easing, it remains a top concern for small
businesses. According to Bank of America internal data, rent payments
per small business client rose 11% year-over-year in July. That’s more
than twice the increase for renting and owning a residence, a metric
known as shelter, according to the government’s monthly Consumer Price
Index. That figure rose 5.1% in July.</p>
<p>And although the situation has improved since the height of the
pandemic, a survey by business networking platform Alignable of more
than 6,000 small business owners found that 41% could not pay their July
rent on time and in full. And 52% said they’ve encountered rent spikes
in the past six months.</p>
<p>The rent for Valentine’s barbershop rose to $4,000 in January from
$3,600 in December, the fifth increase in the past eight years. She had
to raise the price for her cuts from $35 to $40.</p>
<p>Two months ago, she moved locations for a cheaper $3,200 rent, but
her space is smaller now and she sees fewer families coming in.</p>
<p>“A lot of people can’t afford to take a whole family to get
haircuts,” after the price increase, she said.</p>
<p>Peter Yu has owned iPAC Automotive, an auto repair and detailing shop
in Ontario, Canada, for six years. He said the rent on the shop
typically went up about 4% a year. But when his landlord sold the
property to a new owner, Yu’s rent jumped from about $1,800 (2,500
Canadian dollars) to about $2,700 (3,700 Canadian dollars) after three
months.</p>
<p>He contemplated moving but decided that the cost of a move would be
more than just paying the extra rent.</p>
<p>Yu tried to raise prices a month ago, but customers would come in and
say “Oh, its too expensive,” and leave, he said. So, he had to drop the
price increase in order to get those customers back.</p>
<p>“When we do try to raise our prices, consumers don’t have the money
to pay for it. They’re looking for financing options,” he said. Yu’s
services run the gamut from paint correction that costs a few hundred
dollars to troubleshooting problematic EV battery and electric drive
units for out-of-warranty Teslas that can cost up to $15,000.</p>
<p>So instead, he’s going to try to improve his marketing, close more
sales, and find a way to offer more financing.</p>
<p>Standing firm against a landlord sometimes works. Janna Rodriguez has
run her home-based The Innovative Daycare Corp. in Freeport, New York,
since 2018. When she first signed her lease, she paid $3,500, plus costs
including landscaping and maintenance. In 2020, the pandemic began, and
her landlord raised her rent to $3,800 and also made her start paying
half of the homeowner’s insurance. Last year, the landlord raised her
rent to $4,100, plus the additional expenses.</p>
<p>Rodriguez raised her prices for the first time, by $10 per child per
week, to help offset the rising rent.</p>
<p>This year she successfully pushed back when the landlord wanted to
raise the rent yet again.</p>
<p>“I said to them, if you do that, then I’m going to find another
property to move my business to, because at this point now you’re trying
to bankrupt a business, right?” </p>
<p>It’s worked – so far. But Rodriguez is worried about the future.</p>
<p>For others, negotiating a late payment is an option. Nicole Pomije
owner of Minneapolis-based The Cookie Cups, which makes cookie kits for
kids, has a 372-square-meter office space along with a warehouse where
she develops her line of baking kits. Her rent rose 10% this year to
$4,000 monthly. Then there are unanticipated bills, such as $1,500 for
snow plowing.</p>
<p>“There’s so much stuff that pops up that you just you never expect,”
she said. “And it’s always when you never expect it.”</p>
<p>Pomije hasn’t raised prices, but instead tried to mitigate the higher
rent costs by buying materials in bulk – like ordering 5,000 boxes
instead of 1,000 boxes for a 40% discount – and finding cost savings
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Still, there have been several months over the past couple of years
where she couldn’t pay rent on time. So, far the landlord has been
amenable.</p>
<p>“If we have a conversation like hey, we don’t know if we’re going to
make it for the first this month. It might be closer to the tenth,” she
said.</p>
<p>Asked if she thinks costs might ease in the future, Pomije said she
is focused on the present.</p>
<p>“It’s weird, but I’m trying not to think about the future too much
and I’m trying to just do what we have to do, and get ready for a
holiday season and just, like, get everything paid on time now,” she
said. “And then we’ll kind of reevaluate everything in January.”</p>

<h2
id="heres-what-harris-and-trump-have-said-about-easing-costs-for-families">Here’s
what Harris and Trump have said about easing costs for families</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The high cost of caring for children and the elderly has
forced women out of the workforce, devastated family finances, and left
professional caretakers in low-wage jobs — all while slowing economic
growth. </p>
<p>That families are suffering is not up for debate. As the economy
emerges as a theme in this presidential election, the Democratic and
Republican candidates have sketched out ideas for easing costs that
reveal their divergent views about family. </p>
<p>On this topic, the two tickets have one main commonality: Both of the
presidential candidates — and their running mates — have, at one point
or another, backed an expanded child tax credit. </p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, who accepted the Democratic Party’s
nomination last week, has signaled that she plans to build on the
ambitions of outgoing President Joe Biden’s administration, which sought
to pour billions in taxpayer dollars into making child care and home
care for elderly and disabled adults more affordable. She has not etched
any of those plans into a formal policy platform. But in a speech
earlier this month, she said her vision included raising the child tax
credit. </p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican, has declined to answer
questions about how he would make child care more affordable, even
though it was an issue he tackled during his own administration. His
running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio, has a long history of pushing
policies that would encourage Americans to have families, floating ideas
like giving parents votes for their children. Just this month, Vance
said he wants to raise the child tax credit to $5,000. But Vance has
opposed government spending on child care, arguing that many children
benefit from having one parent at home as caretaker. </p>
<p>The candidates’ care agendas could figure prominently into their
appeal to suburban women in swing states, a coveted demographic seen as
key to victory in November. Women provide two-thirds of unpaid care work
— valued at $1 trillion annually — and are disproportionately impacted
when families can’t find affordable care for their children or aging
parents. And the cost of care is an urgent problem: Child care prices
are rising faster than inflation. </p>
<p>Kamala Harris: Increase child tax credit </p>
<p>When Harris addressed the Democratic National Convention, she talked
first about her own experience with child care. She was raised mostly by
a single mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who worked long hours as a breast
cancer researcher. Among the people who formed her family’s support
network was “Mrs. Shelton, who ran the day care below us and became a
second mother.” </p>
<p>As vice president, Harris worked behind the scenes in Congress on
Biden’s proposals to establish national paid family leave, make
prekindergarten universal, and invest billions in child care so families
wouldn’t pay more than 7% of their income. She announced, too, the
administration’s actions to lower copays for families using federal
child care vouchers, and to raise wages for Medicaid-funded home health
aides. Before that, her track record as a senator included pressing for
greater labor rights for domestic workers, including nannies and home
health aides who may be vulnerable to exploitation. </p>
<p>This month at a community college in North Carolina, Harris outlined
her campaign’s economic agenda, which includes raising the child tax
credit to as much as $3,600 and giving families of newborns even more —
$6,000 for the child’s first year. </p>
<p>“That is a vital — vital year of critical development of a child, and
the costs can really add up, especially for young parents who need to
buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else,” she told the
audience. Her running mate selection of Tim Walz, who established paid
leave and a child tax credit as governor of Minnesota, has also buoyed
optimism among supporters. </p>
<p>Donald Trump: Few specifics, but some past support </p>
<p>For voters grappling with the high cost of child care, Trump has
offered little in the way of solutions. During the June presidential
debate, CNN moderator Jake Tapper twice asked Trump what he would do to
lower child care costs. Both times, he failed to answer, instead
pivoting to other topics. His campaign platform is similarly silent. It
does tackle the cost of long-term care for the elderly, writing that
Republicans would “support unpaid Family Caregivers through Tax Credits
and reduced red tape.” </p>
<p>The silence marks a shift from his first campaign, when he pitched
paid parental leave, though it was panned by critics because his
proposal excluded fathers. When he reached the White House, the former
president sought $1 billion for child care, plus a parental leave policy
at the urging of his daughter and policy adviser, Ivanka Trump. Congress
rejected both proposals, but Trump succeeded in doubling the child tax
credit and establishing paid leave for federal employees. </p>
<p>In his 2019 State of the Union address, Trump said he was “proud to
be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide
paid family leave, so that every new parent has the chance to bond with
their newborn child.” </p>
<p>This year, there are signs that his administration might not pursue
the same agenda, including his selection of Vance as a running mate. In
2021, before he joined the Senate, Vance co-authored an op-ed for The
Wall Street Journal opposing a proposal to invest billions in child care
to make it more affordable for families. He and his co-author said
expanding child care subsidies would lead to “unhappier, unhealthier
children” and that having fewer mothers contributing to the economy
might be a worthwhile trade-off. </p>
<p>Vance has floated policies that would make it easier for a family to
live off of a single income, making it possible for some parents to stay
home while their partners work. Along with his embrace of policies he
calls pro-family, he has tagged people who do not have or want children
as “sociopaths.” He once derided Harris and other rising Democratic
stars as “childless cat ladies,” even though Harris has two stepchildren
— they call her “Momala” — and no cats. </p>
<p>Even without details about new care policies, Trump believes that
families would ultimately get a better deal under his
administration. </p>
<p>The Trump-Vance campaign has attacked Harris’ record on the economy
and said the Biden administration’s policies have only made things
tougher for families, pointing to recent inflation. </p>
<p>“Harris … has proudly and repeatedly celebrated her role as Joe
Biden’s co-pilot on Bidenomics,” said Karoline Leavitt, a campaign
spokeswoman. “The basic necessities of food, gas and housing are less
affordable, unemployment is rising, and Kamala doesn’t seem to
care.”</p>

This month, Pino reached the northern tip of Vancouver Island, sailed
south through Johnstone Strait, and into calmer, familiar waters on the
11th of August. Both of us were eager for a taste of summer weather, we
hoped to catch what was left of it. Our legs demanded an anchorage with
options for walking, so we chose to anchor in {Hathayim Marine Park}.
The lovely people on the sailboat Nanamuk were anchored here too, they
<a href="https://100r.co/site/hathayim_marine_park.html#aug2024">mapped
many of the trails</a> in the area, even the overgrown, less-traveled
routes. We
<a href="https://100r.co/site/western_canada.html#2024">updated our
summer route map</a> through northern B.C.
</p>
<p>
From May 1st to August 11th, like with our book
<a href="https://100r.co/site/busy_doing_nothing.html">Busy Doing
Nothing</a>, Rek kept a detailed logbook of daily happenings onboard. We
hope to publish these notes to this wiki soon.
</p>
<p>
<b>Book Club:</b> This month we are reading <i>The Adventures of
Sherlock Holmes</i> by Arthur Conan Doyle, <i>The Design of Everyday
Things</i> by Don Norman, and <i>Everyday Utopia: What 2000 years of
Wild Experiments Can Teach Us About the Good Life</i> by Kristen R.
Ghodsee.

Here, I make the case that it is more about your tempermant and

you’ll knock it out of the park.</p>
