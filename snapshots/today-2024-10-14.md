## 12th-gen Amazon Kindle Paperwhite with 7 inch display leaked

date: 2024-10-14, from: Liliputing

<p>Rumor has it that Amazon could launch a 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite eReader this week. And that would probably help explain why the 11th-gen model is out of stock. But it looks like at least one person may have already gotten their hands on one a little early&#8230; and briefly tried to sell it on eBay. [&#8230;]</p>

## A Google breakup is on the table, say DOJ lawyers

date: 2024-10-13, from: OS News

Next up in my backlog of news to cover: the US Department of Justice&#8217;s proposed remedies for Google&#8217;s monopolistic abuse. Now that Judge Amit Mehta has&#160;found Google is a monopolist, lawyers for the Department of Justice have begun proposing solutions to correct the company’s illegal behavior and restore competition to the market for search engines. In a new&#160;32-page filing&#160;(included below), they said they are considering both “behavioral and structural remedies.“ That covers everything from applying a consent decree to keep an eye on the company’s behavior to forcing it to sell off parts of its business, such as Chrome, Android, or Google Play. ↫ Richard Lawler at The Verge While I think it would be a great idea to break Google up, such an action taken in a vacuum seems to be rather pointless. Say Google is forced to spin off Android into a separate company &#8211; how is that relatively small Android, Inc. going to compete with the behemoth that is Apple and its iOS to which such restrictions do not apply? How is Chrome Ltd. going to survive Microsoft&#8217;s continued attempts at forcing Edge down our collective throats? Being a dedicated browser maker is working out great for Firefox, right? This is the problem with piecemeal, retroactive measures to try and &#8220;correct&#8221; a market position that you have known for years is being abused &#8211; sure, this would knock Google down a peg, but other, even larger megacorporations like Apple or Microsoft will be the ones to benefit most, not any possible new companies or startups. This is exactly why a market-wide, equally-applied set of rules and regulations, like the European Union&#8217;s Digital Markets Act, is a far better and more sustainable approach. Unless similar remedies are applied to Google&#8217;s massive competitors, these Google-specific remedies will most likely only make things worse, not better, for the American consumer.

## Internet Archive hacked and victim of DDoS attacks

date: 2024-10-13, from: OS News

Internet Archive&#8217;s &#8220;The Wayback Machine&#8221; has suffered a data breach after a threat actor compromised the website and stole a user authentication database containing 31 million unique records. News of the breach began circulating Wednesday afternoon after visitors to archive.org began seeing a JavaScript alert created by the hacker,&#160;stating that the Internet Archive was breached. &#8220;Have you ever felt like the Internet Archive runs on sticks and is constantly on the verge of suffering a catastrophic security breach? It just happened. See 31 million of you on HIBP!,&#8221; reads a JavaScript alert shown on the compromised archive.org site. ↫ Lawrence Abrams at Bleeping Computer To make matters worse, the Internet Archive was also suffering from waves of distributed denial-of-service attacks, forcing the IA to take down the site while strengthening everything up. It seems the attackers have no real motivation, other than the fact they can, but it&#8217;s interesting, shall we say, that the Internet Archive has been under legal assault by big publishers for years now, too. I highly doubt the two are related in any way, but it&#8217;s an interesting note nonetheless. I&#8217;m still catching up on all the various tech news stories, but this one was hard to miss. A lot of people are rightfully angry and dismayed about this, since attacking the Internet Archive like this kind of feels like throwing Molotov cocktails at a local library &#8211; there&#8217;s literally not a single reason to do so, and the only people you&#8217;re going to hurt are underpaid librarians and chill people who just want to read some books. Whomever is behind this are just assholes, no ifs and buts about it.

## Goodbye Windows 7

I finally seem to be recovering from a nasty flu that is now wreaking havoc all across my tiny Arctic town &#8211; better now than when we hit -40 I guess &#8211; so let&#8217;s talk about something that&#8217;s not going to recover because it actually just fucking died: Windows 7. For nearly everyone, support for Windows 7 ended on January 14th, 2020. However, if you were a business who needed more time to migrate off of it because your CEO didn’t listen to the begging and pleading IT department until a week before the deadline, Microsoft did have an option for you. Businesses could pay to get up to 3 years of extra security updates. This pushes the EOL date for Windows 7 to January 10th, 2023. Okay but that’s still nearly 2 years earlier than October 8th, 2024? ↫ The Cool Blog I&#8217;d like to solve the puzzle! It&#8217;s POSReady, isn&#8217;t it? Of course it is! Windows Embedded POSReady&#8217;s support finally ended a few days ago, and this means that for all intents and purposes, Windows 7 is well and truly dead. In case you happen to be a paleontologist, think of Windows Embedded POSReady adding an extra two years of support to Windows 7 as the mammoths who managed to survive on Wrangel until as late as only 4000 years ago. Windows 7 was one of the good ones, for sure, and all else being equal, I&#8217;d choose it over any of the releases that cam after. It feels like Windows 7 was the last release designed primarily for users of the Windows platform, whereas later releases were designed more to nickle and dime people with services, ads, and upsells that greatly cheapened the operating system. I doubt we&#8217;ll ever see such a return to form again, so Windows 7 might as well be the last truly beloved Windows release. If you&#8217;re still using Windows 7 &#8211; please don&#8217;t, unless you&#8217;re doing it for the retrocomputing thrill. I know Windows 8, 10, and 11 are scary, and as much as it pains me to say this, you&#8217;re better off with 10 or 11 at this point, if only for security concerns.

The reason I’m having so much fun with this mofo is that I have most of the features of textcasting now, and it’s all flowing out through Masto, and I’m not typing into a freaking tiny little text box!
