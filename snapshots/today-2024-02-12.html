<p>The SuperBowl last night was an excellent sports game. I could
totally do without all the bullshit, but it was good sport. However it’s
all about gambling. I bet it’s ruining a lot of lives. A way of sucking

Arrives in Federal Court in Florida for Closed Hearing in Classified
Documents Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Fort Pierce, Florida — Former President Donald Trump arrived Monday
morning at a federal courthouse in Florida for a closed hearing in his
criminal case charging him with mishandling classified documents. </p>
<p>The hearing was scheduled to discuss the procedures for the handling
of classified evidence in the case, which is currently set for trial on
May 20. Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of hoarding
highly classified records at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructing FBI
efforts to get them back. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon expects to hear arguments in the
morning from defense lawyers and in the afternoon from prosecutors, each
outside of the other’s presence. </p>
<p>“Defense counsel shall be prepared to discuss their defense theories
of the case, in detail, and how any classified information might be
relevant or helpful to the defense,” Cannon wrote in scheduling the
hearing. </p>
<p>Trump’s motorcade arrived at the courthouse in Fort Pierce shortly
after 9 a.m. local time. </p>
<p>The hearing is one of several voluntary court appearances that Trump
has made in recent weeks — he was present, for instance, at appeals
court arguments last month in Washington — as he looks to demonstrate to
supporters that he intends to fight the four criminal prosecutions he
faces while also seeking to reclaim the White House this November.</p>

United Nations report</a>. The State of the World’s MIgratory Species
report from the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring
Centre (CMS) is the first to study the many creatures – from elephants
to butterflies to birds – that travel thousands of miles every year to
breed, eat, or find new climates. The report examined 1,189 of these
species and found some 44% are in population decline. Perhaps the most
shocking takeaway is the dire state of the world’s migratory fish
species: Ninety-seven percent are facing extinction. Migratory reptiles
are also in trouble, with 70% threatened. Overexploitation and habitat
loss due to human activity are the largest pressures contributing to
these losses. “These animals are, first and foremost, part of the
ecosystems where they’re found,” CMS executive secretary Amy Fraenkel

CNN. “And we have a lot of evidence showing that if you remove these
species, if they decline, it will have impacts on the ecosystems where
they’re found, and not in a positive way.” Protecting migrating animals
can be a challenge because it requires cross-border cooperation.

This would trigger major shifts in regional climates and devastate

warming scenarios and were able to trigger a collapse in the model AMOC,

its electric lineup will give farmers more flexibility and help them
lower costs. “They can manage yield and plant health on a more frequent
basis; enabled by the cost of that pass being so low. They are no longer
exposed to fuel costs. Producers can focus on the health of the
plants/animals, and truly optimize the material inputs such as
fertilizers, chemicals, and feeds.” It mentions reduced CO2 emissions,
too, but only briefly, suggesting John Deere thinks the key to
encouraging farmers to swap out their legacy equipment is to focus on
operational improvements rather than environmental benefits.

<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> It’s alleged that Starlink, the
internet connection system made by Elon Musk-owned SpaceX, is being used
by Russian troops. Musk has previously made assurances that Russia
wouldn’t be able to use to it. Then, construction of a new ammunition
factory gets underway in Germany, and Ireland’s government struggles to
provide housing and other necessities for migrants.

<h2 id="biden-welcomes-king-of-jordan-to-discuss-hostage-deal">Biden
Welcomes King of Jordan to Discuss Hostage Deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is hosting Jordan’s King Abdullah II
in Washington Monday and the two leaders are expected to discuss the
ongoing effort to free hostages held in Gaza, and growing concern over
an Israeli military operation in the port city of Rafah.</p>
<p>It is the first meeting between the allies since three American
troops were killed last month in a drone strike against a U.S. base in
Jordan. Biden blamed Iran-backed militias for the fatalities, the first
for the U.S. after months of strikes by such groups against American
forces across the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas
war.</p>
<p>The meeting with King Abdullah II comes as Biden and his aides are
working to broker another pause in Israel’s war against Hamas in order
to send humanitarian aid and supplies into the region and get hostages
out. The White House faces growing criticism from Arab-Americans over
the administration’s continued support for Israel in the face of growing
casualties in Gaza.</p>
<p>It appeared a deal for another pause in the fighting was getting
close. A senior U.S. administration official said Sunday that after
weeks of shuttle diplomacy and phone conversations, a framework was
essentially in place for a deal that could see the release of the
remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for a halt to
fighting.</p>
<p>The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the
negotiations, acknowledged that gaps remained but declined to specify
what they are. The official said Israeli military pressure on Hamas in
Khan Younis over the last several weeks has helped bring the militant
group closer to accepting an agreement. The potential for an agreement
took up the majority of Biden’s call Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>The official said the two leaders also had a significant back and
forth about the potential expansion of Israeli military operations into
Rafah and that Biden reiterated U.S. opposition to the idea under the
“current conditions” while more than 1.3 million people are sheltering
there.</p>
<p>It was the most forceful language yet from the president on the
possible operation. Biden, who last week called Israel’s military
response in Gaza “over the top,” also sought “urgent and specific” steps
to strengthen humanitarian aid. Israel’s Channel 13 television said the
conversation lasted 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The official said the Israelis “made clear they would not contemplate
an operation” in Rafah without safeguarding the civilian population. The
official said the U.S. is not sure there is a feasible or implementable
plan to relocate civilians out of Rafah to allow military operations to
take place.</p>
<p>Jordan and other Arab states have been highly critical of Israel’s
actions and have eschewed public support for long-term planning over
what happens next, arguing that the fighting must end before such
discussions can begin. They have been demanding a cease-fire since
mid-October as civilian casualties began to skyrocket.</p>
<p>Biden had planned to visit Jordan during his trip to Israel in
October shortly after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas, but the trip was
scrapped. On his way home from Israel, Biden announced he’d helped
broker the first deal to pause fighting temporarily and to open the
crossing in Rafah to humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>In the months since, members of his administration have made repeated
trips to the region to engage with leaders there.</p>

<h2 id="housekeeping">Housekeeping</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
First housekeeping post of 2024. Hope you all had a great beginning of
the year. As usual, a couple of things in no particular order:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a> is about to
hit 25 interviews. There’s 52 weeks in a year so we’re almost half way
through year one. I’m happy to see that people are enjoying the series.
Makes me so happy.
</li>
<li>
Running Minimalissimo is fun. I’ve already coded a few things for the
site—a
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/books-and-a-new-navigation">new
navigation</a>, a new
<a href="https://minimalissimo.com/articles/stream">stream</a> section
and also a new books page—and I have plenty of other things I want to
do.
</li>
<li>
My <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/one-a-month">one a month
experiment</a> is a tiny success. Kind people are still out there and I
think it’s important to try support a more sane web in a sustainable
way.
</li>
<li>
I’m hosting the
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/indieweb-carnival-digital-relationships">IndieWeb
Carnival this month</a>. You can find the first 15 submissions at the
link above and you have time until February 28th to send yours.
</li>
<li>
I’m redesigning my blog. It’s not a true redesign, it will feel very
familiar if you visited this site over the past 5 or 6 years. Structure
will stay pretty much the same but I felt the need to tweak a few things
here and there. I’m also going to reintroduce a web font. I was in my
20s the last time I used one on this site. Gonna be fun.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
And that’s all I have for this February housekeeping. As always my inbox
is open if you want to get in touch. Have a great day.

<p>On February 12, 1809, Nancy Hanks Lincoln gave birth to her second
child, a son: Abraham. Abraham Lincoln grew up to become the nation’s
sixteenth president, leading the country from March 1861 until his
assassination in April 1865, a little over a month into his second term.
He piloted the country through the Civil War, preserving the concept of
American democracy. It was a system that had never been fully realized
but that he still saw as “the last, best hope of earth” to prove that
people could govern themselves.</p>

Imposing Curfew at More Migrant Shelters Following Recent Violent
Incidents</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — New York is expanding a curfew to additional migrant
shelters after violent incidents attributed to migrant shelter residents
gained national attention in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Mayor Eric Adams’ administration will impose an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.
curfew at 20 migrant shelters starting Monday, after initially placing
the restrictions at four other locations, spokesperson Kayla Mamelak
said Sunday.</p>
<p>The curfew impacts about 3,600 migrants, with the largest of the
emergency centers housing nearly 1,000 migrants in Long Island City,
Queens, according to a listing provided by the mayor’s office.</p>
<p>City officials initially placed a curfew on four shelters last month
in response to neighborhood complaints.</p>
<p>Mamelak said the curfews are in line with restrictions already in
place at NYC’s traditional homeless shelters and allow for “more
efficient capacity management” of migrants in the city’s care.</p>
<p>“New York City continues to lead the nation in managing this national
humanitarian crisis, and that includes prioritizing the health and
safety of both asylum seekers in our care and New Yorkers who live in
the communities surrounding the emergency shelters we manage,” she said
in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>The additional curfews come after a spate of migrant-related violence
and crime has prompted increasingly dire rhetoric from city and police
officials.</p>
<p>A 15-year-old teen from Venezuela was arrested Friday for opening
fire in Times Square while fleeing from police after being stopped by
security for suspected shoplifting. The shooting injured a tourist from
Brazil.</p>
<p>A video showing a group of migrants brawling with police in Times
Square last month also went viral and led to several arrests.</p>
<p>The total of 24 migrant shelters now subject to the restrictions
represents a fraction of the more than 200 such facilities the city
operates to house some 66,000 newly arrived asylum seekers.</p>

id="father-in-gender-reveal-that-sparked-fatal-california-wildfire-pleads-guilty">Father
in Gender-Reveal That Sparked Fatal California Wildfire Pleads
Guilty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>San Bernardino, California — A man whose family’s gender reveal
ceremony sparked a Southern California wildfire that killed a
firefighter in 2020 has pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter,
prosecutors said Friday.</p>
<p>The El Dorado Fire erupted on Sept. 5, 2020, when Refugio Manuel
Jimenez Jr. and Angelina Jimenez and their young children staged a baby
gender reveal at El Dorado Ranch Park in Yucaipa, at the foot of the San
Bernardino Mountains.</p>
<p>A smoke-generating pyrotechnic device was set off in a field and
quickly ignited dry grass on a scorching day. The couple frantically
tried to use bottled water to douse the flames and called 911,
authorities said.</p>
<p>Strong winds stoked the fire as it ran through wilderness on national
forest land, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Los Angeles.
Charles Morton, the 39-year-old leader of the elite Big Bear Interagency
Hotshot Squad, was killed on Sept. 17, 2020, when flames overran a
remote area where firefighters were cutting fire breaks. Morton had
worked as a firefighter for 18 years, mostly with the U.S. Forest
Service. </p>
<p>On Friday, the San Bernardino County district attorney announced that
Refugio Manuel Jimenez Jr. had pleaded guilty to one count of
involuntary manslaughter and two counts of recklessly causing a fire to
an inhabited structure. He will be taken into custody on February 23 to
serve a year in jail. His sentence also includes two years of felony
probation and 200 hours of community service.</p>
<p>Angelina Jimenez pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor counts of
recklessly causing fire to the property of another. She was sentenced to
a year of summary probation and 400 hours of community service. The
couple was also ordered to pay $1,789,972 in restitution.</p>
<p>Their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment
Sunday.</p>
<p>“Resolving the case was never going to be a win,” District Attorney
Jason Anderson said in a news release, offering his condolences to
Morton’s family. “To the victims who lost so much, including their homes
with valuables and memories, we understand those are intangibles can
never be replaced.”</p>
<p>The blaze injured 13 other people and forced the evacuations of
hundreds of residents in small communities in the San Bernardino
National Forest area. It destroyed five homes and 15 other
buildings.</p>
<p>Flames blackened nearly 36 square miles (92 square kilometers) of
land in San Bernardino and Riverside counties before the blaze was
contained on Nov. 16, 2020.</p>
<p>The fire was one of thousands during a record-breaking wildfire
season in California that charred more than 4% of the state while
destroying nearly 10,500 buildings and killing 33 people.</p>
<p>Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have
made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much
warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather
more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p>

<h2 id="us-military-strikes-more-missiles-in-yemen">US Military Strikes
More Missiles in Yemen</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. military said Sunday it had struck more devices
and missiles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen that were prepared to
launch against ships in the Red Sea.</p>
<p>The strikes occurred Saturday between 4-5 p.m. (1300-1400 GMT) north
of the city of Hodeida, the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said on
social media. </p>
<p>American “forces successfully conducted self-defense strikes against
two unmanned surface vessels (USV) and three mobile anti-ship cruise
missiles (ASCM)… that were prepared to launch against ships in the Red
Sea,” the statement said.</p>
<p>The Houthi-run Al-Masirah television on Saturday night reported three
strikes on the Salif port area, while an AFP correspondent in the area
heard loud blasts.</p>
<p>The strikes are part of a series of actions taken by the United
States and its allies against the Houthis, aimed at halting the
Iran-backed rebels’ repeated attacks on vital Red Sea shipping
lanes.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Houthis confirmed that 17 of their fighters had been
killed in recent strikes, following a previous announcement Thursday by
the United States that it had struck missile launchers.</p>
<p>The Houthis, who control much of war-torn Yemen including the port of
Hodeida, began their attacks in November, saying they were hitting
Israel-linked vessels in support of Palestinians in Gaza, which has been
ravaged by the Israel-Hamas war. </p>
<p>U.S. and British forces have responded with strikes against the
Houthis, who have since declared the two countries’ interests to be
legitimate targets as well.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the Houthi rebels said they had struck U.S. and British
ships in two attacks in the Red Sea, causing minor damage but no
casualties.</p>
<p>The Red Sea attacks have raised insurance premiums for shipping
companies, forcing many to avoid the Red Sea, a vital route that
normally carries about 12 percent of global maritime trade.</p>

<h2 id="vegas-super-bowl-blockbuster-kicks-off">Vegas Super Bowl
Blockbuster Kicks Off</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Las Vegas, Nevada — The San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs
kicked off a blockbuster Super Bowl showdown here Sunday as Las Vegas
stages the American sporting showpiece for the first time.</p>
<p>The neon-lit gambling capital in the Nevada desert had reached a
fever pitch of anticipation for the NFL championship game that has
topped even the usual outsized levels of hype.</p>
<p>The romance between pop megastar Taylor Swift and the Chiefs’
charismatic Travis Kelce is just one of the storylines of a game that is
expected to smash U.S. television viewing records.</p>
<p>Swift dashed back to the United States from the latest leg of her
global tour in Tokyo on Saturday and will be among a slew of celebrities
and VIPs packed into the 65,000-seat Allegiant Stadium to see if Kelce
and the Chiefs can win a third Super Bowl crown in five seasons.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration says a fleet of around 500
private jets has swept into Las Vegas for the game, which kicks off at
3.30pm local time (2330 UTC).</p>
<p>The galaxy of VIPS is part of an invasion of more than 300,000
visitors who have descended on the city for the Super Bowl weekend,
pumping an estimated $600- $700 million into the local economy,
according to city officials.</p>
<p>The horde of tourists has flocked to nightclubs and celebrity-hosted
parties and eve-of-game concerts featuring stars such as U2, Adele,
Christina Aguilera and Green Day.</p>
<p>Those fans lucky enough to have a ticket for the game, where R&amp;B
star Usher headlines the half-time show, have paid handsomely for the
privilege.</p>
<p>Ticket bonanza</p>
<p>The cheapest seats available on resale ticketing website Stubhub on
Sunday came with a hefty $5,713 price tag, with the most expensive
listed at a staggering $196,875.</p>
<p>The American Gaming Association, meanwhile, projects that a record
67.8 million Americans – around a quarter of the country’s adult
population – will place a bet on the Super Bowl, generating an estimated
$23.1 billion.</p>
<p>This year’s Super Bowl, meanwhile, has taken on political overtones
due to Swift’s relationship with Kelce, with right-wing conspiracy
theorists seeing it as evidence of a plot to influence the outcome of
this year’s U.S. presidential election if the singer endorses Joe
Biden.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, took aim
at the singer on Sunday, claiming any endorsement of Biden by Swift
would be “disloyal” given that his administration passed copyright
legislation in 2018 widely seen as benefiting artists and
performers.</p>
<p>“Joe Biden didn’t do anything for Taylor, and never will,” Trump
wrote on Truth Social.</p>
<p>“There’s no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and
most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to
the man who made her so much money.</p>
<p>“Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis, even though he may be a
Liberal, and probably can’t stand me!”</p>
<p>Chiefs eye dynasty</p>
<p>The sporting dimension of the occasion, meanwhile, has all the
ingredients of a classic.</p>
<p>The Chiefs are playing in their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons,
hoping to cement their dynasty status with a third Vince Lombardi Trophy
after wins in 2020 and 2023.</p>
<p>The franchise would also be the first team since the New England
Patriots in 2003 and 2004 to win back-to-back Super Bowls.</p>
<p>The Chiefs conducted a final training walkthrough on Saturday which
left head coach Andy Reid satisfied that his team is primed to defend
their title.</p>
<p>“I was pleased with what I saw,” Reid said after the workout. “I
think they’re ready to go play.”</p>
<p>The 49ers camp was similarly buoyant after their final workout. “Our
guys are ready to go,” head coach Kyle Shanahan said. “They’re
relaxed.”</p>
<p>Sunday’s game is a repeat of the 2020 Super Bowl, when Chiefs
quarterback Patrick Mahomes led a stirring fourth-quarter comeback with
21 unanswered points to beat San Francisco 31-20.</p>
<p>The 49ers, meanwhile, are chasing a sixth Super Bowl and their first
since 1994-1995.</p>
<p>San Francisco emerged from the regular season with the best record in
the NFC but survived nerve-shredding playoff games against the Green Bay
Packers and Detroit Lions to book their ticket to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>San Francisco head coach Shanahan, meanwhile, is aiming to end his
long wait to finally get his hands on the Vince Lombardi Trophy in his
third Super Bowl.</p>
<p>As well as the loss to Kansas City in 2020, Shanahan was the
offensive coordinator when the Atlanta Falcons blew a 28-3 lead in the
2017 Super Bowl before losing to New England.</p>

<p>Russia attacked Ukraine with another barrage of drones. This comes as
additional U.S. funding for Kyiv’s efforts to defend itself faces
hurdles in a divided U.S. Congress. As VOA’s Arash Arabasadi reports,
the two U.S. presidential front-runners have diametrically opposed views
on Ukraine and NATO.</p>

Legal Team Went to DOJ Over What They Viewed as ‘Cherry Picked’ Digs at
His Memory</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Del. — President Joe Biden’s personal attorney said
Sunday he went to both the special counsel and the attorney general to
register concerns over what he viewed to be pejorative and unnecessary
digs at the president’s memory. </p>
<p>“This is a report that went off the rails,” Bob Bauer said on CBS’
Face the Nation Sunday. “It’s a shabby work product.” </p>
<p>The special counsel was investigating whether the president
mishandled classified documents during his previous positions as vice
president and senator, and found this week that no criminal charges were
warranted. </p>
<p>But in building his argument for why no charges were necessary,
Special Counsel Robert Hur, who was appointed by Attorney General
Merrick Garland, detailed in part that Biden’s defense of any potential
charges could possibly be that: “Mr. Biden would likely present himself
to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic,
well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” </p>
<p>And then he went on to cite examples where investigators said the
president’s memory lapsed, including over when his older son Beau had
died. In particular, the comments about Beau Biden enraged the
president, who has been very open about his grief over his son’s death,
speaking often of him. </p>
<p>“How the hell dare he raise that,” Biden questioned angrily following
the report’s release. “Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought
to myself, was it any of their damn business?” </p>
<p>Biden’s age has already been a concern for voters. Democrats are now
answering the widespread questions about the 81-year-old president’s age
and readiness by affirming that Biden is capable of being commander in
chief and trying to discredit people who portray him feeble. First lady
Jill Biden wrote a letter to donors Saturday questioning whether those
comments were politically motivated; it fetched the most money in
donations of any email since Biden launched his campaign. </p>
<p>Bauer, who is married to Biden’s top White House aide Anita Dunn,
said he raised concerns over the inclusion of these details to both Hur
and Garland, which he viewed to be a violation of the Justice Department
norms that essentially work to avoid prejudicing the public against
people who are not charged with a crime. But the appeal failed. </p>
<p>“It’s evident that he had committed to make the report public the way
that the special counsel had written it,” said Bauer. </p>
<p>The president sat down with investigators over several hours just as
the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas happened. He said he answered the
questions truthfully and to the best of his knowledge. </p>
<p>Bauer argued that what didn’t make it into the report were moments
when the president deconstructed questions by investigators and when the
special counsel notes that he’d be taking Biden through “events that are
many years ago,” and notes that he should just give his best
recollection. </p>
<p>He said the special counsel made a decision “to cherry pick in a very
misleading way” what references made it in and what didn’t. </p>
<p>Bauer, too, suggested there was political pressure on the Justice
Department, which is prosecuting former President Donald Trump for
refusing to turn over a trove of classified documents as well as his
role in the Jan. 6 violence at the U.S. Capitol and has been excoriated
by Trump and others as biased and that his prosecution represents a
“two-tiered system of justice.” </p>
<p>Hur is a Republican, and a former U.S. attorney under Trump. </p>
<p>“So you have to wonder with those pressures impinging on the
investigation from the outside knowing the attacks that Republicans have
levied on the law enforcement process, did he decide we would have to
ask that we reach the only legal conclusion possible and then toss in
the rest of it to placate a certain political constituency?” Bauer
asked. </p>
<p>The Justice Department has not commented on the criticism.</p>

President Biden may sometimes act old but remember, this is the same Joe
Biden who successfully coordinated a nationwide election steal in 2020 —
and without leaving a single clue he was the mastermind behind it all.

<h2 id="one-way-is-always-better-than-two">One way is always better than
two</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Most Hacker News threads devolve into people talking about
personalities, not about tech stuff. But yesterday’s
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39324847">thread</a> about
OPML was the rare exception, until someone who says they like me (I
guess) said something personal and ugly.
</p>
<p>
I wonder why after all this time we can’t see how pointless it is to
have opinions about people, esp online. Everything you hear is passed
through someone else’s filters, so you’re getting a huge dose of their
personality along with a sliver of insight into the person they’re
talking about.
</p>
<p>
And don’t forget to factor in that sometimes when someone has put an
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+interop">obstacle</a>
in the way of big companies, you can earn favor inside those companies
by scandalizing the person whose work they object to. There was a lot of
that happening as RSS crossed paths with some very big and rich
companies with lots of employees, and an interest in appearing to
interop without the cost of interop.
</p>
<p>
I’ve tried to add formats, protocols and software to the mix, always
trying to compromise. It’s not mentioned in the Wikipedia page on RSS
that I had a format that does what RSS does, a year before it existed,
but I gave it up so that Netscape and UserLand would build on the same
format, RSS.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t invent RSS. I did something much greater, I compromised. We had
the leading blogging software at the time, and Netscape had the feeds of
four credible news orgs. When you put them together, that turned out to
be huge power. We eventually pulled in all of social media and all of
professional publishing into one format. Ask anyone who was active at
the time. The blogging world adopted RSS in an instant, in 1999 and
2000. And in 2002, when the NYT adopted it, again, in an instant the
entire news world all of a sudden all had RSS feeds. You can see it in
the steady stream of announcements in the archive of
<a href="http://scripting.com/">this blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
BTW there was someone brilliant at Netscape who saw our compromise and
responded with more compromise. Their next version of RSS had some of
the features we had left behind in our format. We never asked them to do
that, they just figured it out. Collaboration is something that requires
two, one person can’t collaborate on their own. I know that sounds
ridiculous, but sometimes people don’t look for the other party who made
compromise possible.
</p>
<p>
I don’t think even the people who were closest to it at the time
understood the move. And I don’t think very many appreciate the power
that comes from being the one who throws in the towel on their pet
project to attain unity.
</p>
<p>
One way of doing something is always better than two. That’s just a
restatement of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle#:~:text=It%20is%20often%20reworded%20as,an%20early%20specification%20of%20TCP.">Postel’s
Postulate</a>. Be conservative in what you send.
</p>
<p>
That doesn’t just apply to you, it applies to all of us collectively.
Every time you add something that already exists we’re all going to pay
for it.
</p>
<p>
If you think that saying this makes me
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cantankerous">cantankerous</a> –
well, I say okay – but you’re wrong because it’s generous and brilliant
to push back when people add complexity. Of course people don’t like to
hear they’re doing something wrong, but when it comes to accumulating
complexity debt unnecessarily, well imho you have to listen to that.
Complexity is a force against interop.
</p>
<p>
We should be looking for opportunities to work together to create
something greater than anything any one of us can create.

<h2 id="fast-car">’Fast Car‘</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>While watching the Grammys last Sunday, I was delighted by a duet
performed by Tracy Chapman and Luke Combs. They sang “Fast Car,” a hit
for Chapman in 1988. I was not the only one so moved. As I have
discovered, it was one of the most popular performances of the night. I
am an old-school country music fan, so I was not aware of Combs’ cover
of Chapman’s hit. It certainly is a reason to smile.</p>

<h2 id="longtime-friends-have-attended-every-super-bowl">3 Longtime
Friends Have Attended Every Super Bowl</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KENNEBUNK, Maine — As long as they still have each other, they’re
still going to go to every Super Bowl. </p>
<p>That’s the sentiment shared by three friends who say they are the
final fans who can claim membership in the exclusive “never missed a
Super Bowl” club. And they’re back again for number 58 — Super Bowl 58 —
this year. </p>
<p>The three fans, all in their 80s, are Don Crisman of Maine, Gregory
Eaton of Michigan and Tom Henschel, who splits time between Florida and
Pennsylvania. The three are gathering this weekend in Las Vegas for the
big game, and they’re hoping they can all make it to the sixtieth
edition of the game two years from now. </p>
<p>The fans have sat together at the Super Bowl before, and they were
still trying to make last-minute arrangements to do that for this year’s
game this week. At the very least, they will get together for brunch on
Friday, as always. </p>
<p>Eaton, 84, who runs a ground transportation company in Detroit, has
been especially invested in this year’s football playoffs, as his
beloved Detroit Lions won playoff games for the first time in more than
three decades. The Lions fell just short of qualifying for their first
Super Bowl, but Eaton said getting together with retirees Crisman, 87,
and Henschel, 82, is the real draw of going to the big game year after
year. </p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m a Lions fan,” Eaton said. “But in two years, I just hope
I’ll be in good shape to be there again.” </p>
<p>The men have attended every game since the first AFL-NFL World
Championship Game, the forerunner to the modern Super Bowl, took place
in Los Angeles in 1967. This year’s game is at Allegiant Stadium in Las
Vegas on Sunday. </p>
<p>Crisman and Henschel first met at the 1983 Super Bowl, but they
didn’t meet Eaton until the mid-2010s. The fans have said in the past
that they might be getting ready to let the tradition go, but every year
they make the decision to do it again. </p>
<p>They’re part of an ever-dwindling group of people who have attended
every Super Bowl that has also included media members, football
executives, groundskeepers and others. Norma Hunt, wife of late football
pioneer Lamar Hunt, was the sole woman to attend every Super Bowl until
she died in June. </p>
<p>The fans all said the one thing that could keep them from attending
is if they or one of the other two was not healthy enough or mobile
enough to do it. Health concerns have cropped up for all of them in
recent years, but they all said they’re feeling well enough to go this
year and planning on the next two. </p>
<p>“I think that might be the factor that would definitely tip it,”
Crisman said. “I’m not looking to be the survivor. I just go for the
fun, and the guys. We’ll see what this year brings and address it in
December ’24.” </p>
<p>The three men have witnessed all of the most iconic moments in Super
Bowl history, but some of their most cherished memories of the game are
a little more personal than David Tyree’s “helmet catch” in Super Bowl
42 or Scott Norwood’s missed field goal in Super Bowl 25. Crisman’s home
is adorned with Super Bowl ephemera, right down to a collectible hat
commemorating the first Bud Bowl, a promotion about beer that ran during
Super Bowl 23 in 1989. </p>
<p>Eaton fondly remembers he got his tickets to the first Super Bowl
from a friend from Michigan State University, Herb Adderley, who played
for the Green Bay Packers. Henschel recalls being especially excited for
Super Bowl 3 because New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath, like himself,
was from the Pittsburgh area. </p>
<p>Crisman hadn’t yet acquired tickets for this year’s game as of
mid-January, when telecommunications giant Verizon surprised him with
complementary passes for himself and his daughter, Susan Metevier.
Getting to Las Vegas will be much easier than his trip to Super Bowl 2
in 1968, which involved a 24-hour train ride to Miami. </p>
<p>The three men reminisce fondly about the era when it was possible to
get a ticket to the big game for $8. Henschel recalls getting a face
value ticket to Super Bowl 3 for $12 on the day of the game. This year,
the cheapest tickets available are more than $7,000. </p>
<p>Henschel, a Pittsburgh Steelers fan, has a friendly rivalry with
Crisman, a New England Patriots fan, as the two teams have met
frequently in the playoffs over the years. </p>
<p>This year, the Patriots failed to contend, and the Steelers made an
early playoff exit. But old traditions die hard, Henschel said. </p>
<p>“It’s funny because Don and I, he hates the Steelers and I hate the
Patriots,” Henschel said. “Every time we see each other for the first
time, we give each other the finger.” </p>
<p>It’ll happen again this year. And they hope at least a couple more
times after that.</p>

<p>The official way to create user interfaces for the Windows operating
system changed quite a lot of times during the last years. Microsoft
created and (partially or fully) abadoned a lot of APIs which where
intended to replace the respective previous ones. They changed names and
ways how it’s supposed to be done a few times, and left a lof of
developers confused. Here is a small historical overview. ↫ Nikolaus

<p>Wayland and X.org are both part of freedesktop. Whatever maintenance
is still happening on X.org is mostly being done by people who primarily
work on Wayland. There isn’t some kind of holy war going on between The
Wayland Developers who want to kill X.org, and The X.org Developers who
believe it is great and want to keep it. They’re nearly all the same
people, and they all want X.org to die. AFAIK there isn’t anybody who is
actually clamoring to <em>do the work of maintaining X.org
upstream</em>. There are people who don’t want it to die because Wayland
doesn’t yet have the features they need or the NVIDIA proprietary driver
doesn’t work well on Wayland or whatever, but AFAIK, none of those
people is actually volunteering to maintain X.org long-term. ↫ Adam
Williamson There’s really no clearer summary of the current state of
affairs than this.</p>

Desktops</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>We are happy to announce the creation of a new family of Fedora Linux
spins: Fedora Atomic Desktops! As Silverblue has grown in popularity,
we’ve seen more of our mainline Fedora Linux spins make the jump to
offer a version that implements rpm-ostree. It’s reached the point where
it can be hard to talk about all of them at the same time. Therefore
we’ve introduced a new brand that will serve to simplify how we discuss
rpm-ostree and how we name future atomic spins. ↫ Joseph Gayoso for
Fedora Magazine You can get pretty much any major desktop environment as
an rpm-ostree (inaccurately referred to as ‘immutable’) version of
Fedora, so it makes sense to standardise the naming scheme.</p>

id="accidentally-making-windows-vanish-in-my-old-fashioned-unix-x-environment">Accidentally
making windows vanish in my old-fashioned Unix X environment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>One of the somewhat odd things about my old fashioned X Window System
environment is that when I ‘iconify’ or ‘minimize’ a window, it (mostly)
winds up as an actual icon on my root window (what in some environments
would be called the desktop), in contrast to the alternate approach
where the minimized window is represented in some sort of taskbar. I
have strong opinions about where some of these icons should go, and some
tools to automatically arrange this for various windows, including the
GNU Emacs windows I (now) use for reading email. ↫ Chris Siebenmann
Iconification should be possible in any modern desktop environment, and
it’s sad that this paradigm has pretty much entirely vanished. I would
love for iconified windows to be treated essentially the same way as
files, so you can move them around, drop them inside directories, and
even move them from one computer to another (assuming they have the
application in question installed). If I’m working on a project, and I
have a bunch of LibreOffice documents, spreadsheets, browser tabs, notes
in a text editor, some images open, and so on, I should be able to
iconify them all, keep them in the project’s directory, and de-iconify
them as if nothing had ever happened. Right now, you have to use files
and application states for that, which is cumbersome and annoying.
Sadly, advanced window management is dying. Shame.</p>

this appears to be an attempt by those who controlled the Republican

for guacamole, a favorite game-time food in America: A lack of rain and
warmer temperatures has resulted in fewer avocados being shipped from
Mexico.</p>
<p>The western state of Michoacan, which supplies almost 90% of the
creamy textured fruit for the big game, has suffered a hotter, drier
climate that has led to a lack of water in growing areas.</p>
<p>Lakes in the state are literally drying up: Desperate avocado growers
send tanker trucks down to suck up the last water, or divert streams, to
feed their thirsty orchards, sparking conflicts. The state received
about half the rain it normally gets last year, and reservoirs are at
about 40% of capacity, with no rain in sight for months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some growers are illegally cutting down pine forests that
feed the water system to plant more avocados. To top it all off, another
American obsession — tequila — is starting to cause problems too.</p>
<p>The whole situation is not good for avocados. Last year, avocado
exports from Michoacan for the Super Bowl grew by 20% to 140,000 tons.
This year, that number actually declined by 2,000 tons, despite
increased planting; meaning fewer of the creamy textured fruit in U.S.
produce departments. Alejandro Méndez, the state secretary of the
environment, estimates 30% of avocado orchards in Michoacan are now
water-stressed.</p>
<p>Something’s got to give, and with consumers demanding more
environmentally conscious produce, state officials are finally putting
together a sustainable certification program.</p>
<p>The certification program would presumably result in growers
improving their water use, enabling them to offer consumers both greener
avocados and more of them.</p>
<p>Coming soon to a grocery store near you: fruit with a sticker saying
something like “this avocado wasn’t grown on deforested land,” or “this
avocado used water responsibly.”</p>
<p>Officials are still working on a catchy slogan for the greener
avocados. But given that it’s coming from the same people who brought
you years of Super Bowl ads about avocados from Mexico, a catchy slogan
is highly likely.</p>
<p>“The idea is that there is going to be a certification sticker with a
QR code that you can scan with your telephone, and that link will take
you to a page with a satellite photo of the orchard … and the forest
associated with the orchard,” said Méndez.</p>
<p>Because they use more water than pine forests, growers will have to
contribute to a fund that ensures several acres of forest are preserved
for each acre of orchard.</p>
<p>“So with that orchard, you can be assured the dollar you paid for
this avocado is going to preserve this piece of forest,” said Méndez,
who estimates about 70% of the orchards in place before 2011 were
planted on old farmland, not forests. But the remaining 30% give the
rest a bad name, he complains.</p>
<p>The decision to act comes not a moment too soon. The Center for
Biological Diversity said Thursday that more than 28,000 people have
signed an online petition calling on grocery chains to adopt more
sustainable avocado-sourcing policies.</p>
<p>“Many people in Mexico have lost their forests and water because of
the 304 million pounds [138 kilograms] of avocados we’ll be eating on
Super Bowl Sunday,” said Stephanie Feldstein, the center’s director for
population and sustainability. “Our obsession with avocados has a
horrific hidden cost. It’s time for grocery chains to take
responsibility and make sure they’re not buying avocados grown in
deforested areas.”</p>
<p>Up to now, there hasn’t been much consumers could do. There are few
certified sustainable avocados available year-round on the market, and
if you want guacamole, there’s not much else you can use. That’s despite
all the news coverage about how avocado growers and packers have to pay
protection money to drug cartels.</p>
<p>Julio Santoyo, a front-line anti-logging activist in Villa Madero,
Michoacan, says he’s taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the new
certification program. Until then, Super Bowl this year — like every
year — was “a kick in the pants,” he said.</p>
<p>“The growth in illegal orchards continues unabated,” Santoyo said.
“We assume that more than half of the avocados consumed around the Super
Bowl are from illegal planting.</p>
<p>“Up to now, the Mexican government has not taken practical steps to
certify environmentally sustainable avocado production,” he said.</p>
<p>The crisis is clear in the once heavily forested, lake-dotted state.
Lake Cuitzeo, Mexico’s second largest, was once a vast sheet of water
reflecting blue skies near the state capital; it is now about 60% dry,
exposing kilometers of dry ground and grass.</p>
<p>And poor Michoacan faces new threats from U.S. consumers: Part of the
state next to neighboring Jalisco is certified to grow the blue Weber
agave, the only plant from which true tequila can be distilled.</p>
<p>While agave likes drier, hotter, poorer soils than avocados, growers
are still cutting down native scrub and low, thorny woods to plant the
spikey-leafed seedlings, whose barrel-like centers will later be cooked
down and fermented.</p>
<p>It’s a relatively new problem, fed by rising demand for tequila.</p>
<p>“In the last two years, the price for a kilo of agave went up a lot,
it went up to almost 35 or 40 pesos [about $2] per kilo,” Méndez
said.</p>
<p>“We have 50 million agave plants,” he said. “It’s grown a lot, and we
have started to see deforestation as well in that area.”</p>

and COMP-X: how the Tandy Pocket Computers got a sucky Japanese
assembler</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: Old Vintage Computer Research</p>
I grew up primarily with the Commodore 64, where if you wanted to do
anything really cool and useful, you had to do it in 6502 assembly
language. Today I still write 6502 assembly, plus some Power ISA and
even a little TMS9900. I like assembly languages and how in control of
the CPU you feel writing in one. But you know what would make me
<em>not</em> like an assembly language? One that was contrived and not
actually the CPU it was running on. And you know what would make me like
it even <em>less</em>? If it were kneecapped, convoluted and limited
without even proper I/O facilities.
<p>
<p>But this particular odd little assembler dialect had the bureaucratic
weight of the Japanese government behind it, because in 1969 what was
then the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI, 通商産業省)
developed a completely artificial processor architecture to help ensure
everyone taking the Information Technology Engineer Examination
(情報処理技術者試験) would do so on an even keel. No one would have been
an expert in this architecture or how to program it because we just made
it up, reasoned the Ministry, so therefore no one will have an unfair
advantage on the test.</p>

Of course, that lasted only a few years before the specifications got
out, and soon afterwards a handful of Japanese manufacturers had added
it to their computers as a feature — including their pocket computer
line. Through the magic of Tandy badge engineering, two of them made it
to Radio Shack stores in the United States in the mid-1980s, perplexing
a generation of larval nerds like me who couldn’t understand what the
heck it was doing there. While it was no secret the Tandy PC-5 and Tandy
PC-6 Assembler feature was a fake, few people knew its history or ever
did a detailed exploration. Let’s dig into the dark and gloomy corners
of this utterly bogus virtual CPU that a few real computers ran — sort
of — and write our own cross-assembler and virtual machine so that
future geeks can be just as befuddled.
<p>

In 1970 (昭和45年) the Japanese National Diet passed the
<a href="https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/document?lawid=345AC0000000090">Promotion
of Information Technology Act</a> (情報処理の促進に関する法律), which
among other changes formalized a certification examination for
“information technology engineers” (情報処理技術者). This test, in an
updated form, is still administered today and is the second-most taken
national exam in Japan after the driver’s license examination, with as
many as half a million people sitting for it annually. Those who pass
the Information Technology Engineer Examination (henceforth ITEE)
receive an Information Technology Engineer Examination Certificate
(情報処理技術者試験合格証書) from the Minister of what is now called the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (経済産業省), the successor to
MITI. Originally created by then-MITI and today maintained by METI’s
subordinate <a href="https://www.ipa.go.jp/en/index.html">Information
Technology Promotion Agency</a>, the ITEE nowadays is administered in
two halves over an entire day and comes in four skill levels. While an
ITEE certificate is not a legal requirement to do IT work in Japan, it
is considered very helpful and a gateway to other exams or educational
opportunities, and public institutions hiring such positions will often
list one or more of the levels (and/or subcategories) as a prerequisite.
A smattering of countries outside Japan even accept it as a credential.
<p>
Unlike many industry certification exams, however, the ITEE doesn’t
primarily deal in specific vendors or platforms; instead, it seeks to
test more generalized knowledge such as strategy, project management,
data structures and algorithms. There were only two tiers when the test
was first established in 1969 (prior to the Act), namely class I
(advanced) and class II (basic), today combined as subcategories in the
modern level two exam.
<p>
As part of the test, both exam classes allowed you to select questions
in the programming language you felt most competent at, which at that
point consisted of Fortran, COBOL, PL/I, ALGOL and assembly language. To
eliminate an examinee’s knowledge of a particular CPU as being an
advantage (or disadvantage), the assembler questions instead used a
simple and completely contrived virtual machine that the examinee was
expected to learn on the fly. This virtual machine was called COMP-X,
and its mnemonics and assembler syntax were collectively called CAP-X.
<p>
<p>While COMP-X and CAP-X were always optional on the class II exam and
you could skip it by choosing one of the other languages, in 1977 it
became mandatory for the class I. The pass rate was never very high
(even today it hovers around the ten percent range or so) and until 1979
there wasn’t even a reference text for COMP-X that you could study from.
You only got to see it the day of, and the only computer that it ran on
then was between your ears with a pencil as your co-processor. Since you
were doing all the number crunching on paper, there weren’t any I/O
instructions either since they wouldn’t be needed to answer the exam
questions.</p>

Probably the first actual <em>computer</em> that could run CAP-X code —
in a simulator, mind you — was one of the OKITAC-4300 line, which stood
for Oki Transistor Automatic Computer. Oki Electric’s OKITAC series was
diverse, starting in 1960 with the 4000-transistor OKITAC-5080, the
first Japanese domestic computer to use core memory, and expanding to
large systems and mainframes including the planned 1971 OKITAC-8000 that
was 32-bit, dual CPU and supported up to a full megaword of total memory
to compete directly with IBM’s System/360.
<p>
<p>However, although it was completed, the 8000 couldn’t be released due
to an existing joint venture arrangement with Sperry Rand (now part of
Unisys), with which it would compete also. During the 8000’s ultimately
doomed development Oki determined that the minicomputer market could
give them another way out. The 1968 OKITAC-4300 was the first of these
smaller machines, a 16-bit system supporting up to 32kW of core memory
and running at about 667kHz, and retailing for the comparatively
inexpensive equivalent of around US$10,000 (in 2024 about $88,000). It
became a successful architecture for Oki and 4300-class systems were
manufactured well into the early 1980s, the last of which being the 1980
4300c shown here in a 2010 Oki product retrospective.

<p>This particular machine is a 1974 OKITAC-4300b, the first with an LSI
CPU, offering multiplication and division instructions standard instead
of an option. It was also the first OKITAC-4300 system that could use
conventional RAM chips instead of core, though the core variant was
noticeably faster (1.667MHz compared to 1.429MHz). As a public service,
Oki Electric partnered with a study group in Akashi in October 1979 to
develop a COMP-X simulator on a 4300b and allow study group members to
send in answers to practice questions for execution. COMP-X and the
OKITAC LSI CPU weren’t especially similar architecturally other than
both being 16-bit and having some similar minicomputer idiosyncrasies —
which we’ll discuss — but the CAP-X instruction set was small enough to
make a full software model practical. Because there was no other way to
remotely debug sample code, the simulator added unofficial read and
write instructions to directly deposit and examine data in COMP-X
registers.</p>

With the specification now public in
<a href="https://archive.org/details/Io19802/page/n123/mode/2up?view=theater">major
Japanese computer magazines like <i>I/O</i></a>, there were certainly
other software implementations for the home and personal computers of
the time, but the architecture became a potential selling point for
other small systems — <em>really</em> small ones. Indeed, probably
CAP-X’s most famous commercial implementations were in pocket computers.
<p>
It might be instructive first to talk about pocket computers as a class.
Pocket computers and handheld computers occupied a strange niche in the
1980s and very early 1990s sandwiched between calculators and more
conventional portable computers (laptops, portable workstations and so
forth), largely using bespoke low-power CPUs and small, sometimes
single-line LCD screens. There is somewhat of a continuum between
pockets and handhelds; pockets tended towards portability at the cost of
keyboard or computing power while handhelds tended towards computing
power at the cost of size, so on the “definitely a pocket computer” side
would be things like the Casio PB-100 and Sharp PC-1250, and on the
“definitely a handheld computer” side would be things like the Kyotronic
85 family (TRS-80 Model 100, NEC PC-8201A, etc.), the Texas Instruments
CC-40 and the Canon X-07. However, there were larger pocket computers
powerful enough to rival handhelds such as the Sharp PC-1500, the Casio
PB-2000C, the Panasonic HHC-4 and the Texas Instruments TI-74, and a few
full-size handhelds that had computing capabilities more typical of
pocket computers, like the
<a href="/2021/03/those-mysterious-toshiba-t-chips-plus.html">VTech
Laser 50</a>. As with most computers of this era, the vast majority of
both computing classes provided BASIC as their primary programming
language.
<p>
While many companies made pocket-class machines, Sharp and Casio were
probably the best known and most prolific, and their devices are the
ones most commonly encountered in the West. They were also cloned and
rebadged both domestically and abroad, and both companies made pocket
computers that implemented CAP-X compatibility as a secondary feature.
Sharp’s 1985
<a href="http://www.cavefischer.at/spc/html/Info_PC-1440.html">PC-1440</a>
was a 4K device (3500 bytes free) using the 8-bit
<a href="https://github.com/utz82/SC61860-Instruction-Set">Hitachi
SC61860</a> CPU employed in some of Sharp’s other systems. The PC-1440’s
CPU could be directly programmed with BASIC <tt>PEEK</tt>, <tt>POKE</tt>
and <tt>CALL</tt>, similar to their bigger and more powerful PC-1500,
but the only
<a href="http://www.pungerer.net/pfx/MesPockets/sharp/pc-1440.htm"><em>advertised</em></a>
assembly language feature on the PC-1440 was CAP-X. In 1986 Sharp made a
cheaper variant with slightly less memory, the
<a href="http://pocket.free.fr/html/sharp/pc-1416g_e.html">PC-1416G</a>.
Both systems prominently badged their case with their CAP-X capability
but neither of them was widely seen outside of Japan.
<p>
Casio’s units became much better known, however, not least of which
because of who imported them. These early-generation Casio pocket
computers were based around the Hitachi 8-bit HD61700 and 4-bit HD61900
microcontroller families, such as the popular PB-100 and its many
relatives which used a 200kHz HD61913. The microcontrollers incorporated
the CPU, mask ROM, I/O (primarily for the keyboard) and an LCD
controller into a single monster IC, with most of the RAM usually in
separate chip(s). Casio’s CAP-X compatible line started with the 1985
<a href="http://pocket.free.fr/html/casio/fx-770p_e.html">FX-770P</a>, a
clamshell folding device with 2K of RAM, expanding to the 1985 FX-780P
with 4K, the FX-781P with 2K again (but with a 2K expansion option), the
FX-785P also with 2K (but an <em>8K</em> expansion option), the 1986
FX-790P with 8K (and the 8K option), and the FX-791P with 10K (and the
8K option also). All of these machines had exactly the same form factor
and LCD with mostly the same onboard software and keyboard, differing
only in Data Bank features in the FX-785P and up and memory size. Unlike
Sharp’s entries, however, the Casio devices carried no mention of CAP-X
or COMP-X on the case, merely that they had an “Assembler” mode.
<p>
<p>I mentioned that both Sharp and Casio pocket computers were cloned
and rebadged, and at least in the United States and for most countries
that had a Radio Shack retail presence, the most significant of these
rebadgers by far was the Tandy Corporation. While Tandy did have
internal development resources, they generally preferred to expand their
product line through aggressive badge engineering instead, selling a
smattering of relabeled import consumer electronics direct to customers
in Radio Shack stores.
<a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/tpm/138.html">Tandy’s first
pocket computer</a>, the 1980 PC-1, was a rebadge of the Sharp PC-1211,
the direct successor and upgraded RAM version of the PC-1210, the first
“true” pocket computer. Tandy selected two more Sharp units to rebadge
(and one more several years later) before
<a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/tpm/4567.html">migrating to
Casio’s cheaper line</a> in 1983 with the PC-4 (PB-100) and finally the
1985 PC-5 and 1986 PC-6 (from the FX-780P and FX-790P respectively), the
units that came to puzzle young me reading about them in the Radio Shack
catalogue. And that’s how CAP-X came to America.</p>

<p>Tandy’s interest probably most came from the FX-770P series’
laptop-like form factor (here showing the PC-5/FX-780P compared with an
M1 MacBook Air), but as 2K of RAM wasn’t much of an upgrade over the 1K
base PC-4 which Tandy was still selling, the company instead chose to
start with the midrange 4K FX-780P. The arrangement was particularly
convenient for Tandy as Casio had fitted the FX-770P series with the
same I/O port as the PB-100 and relatives, so the same tape interface
and printer Tandy was already selling for the PC-4 would work for the
PC-5 and PC-6, though they had to use a rather clumsy link cable to
connect them. The FX-780P was sold officially as the Tandy Pocket
Scientific Computer PC-5 to emphasize its scientific and statistical
features (as was the PC-6), and the PC-5 will be the unit we’ll

Unfortunately, you can’t really <em>use</em> it like a laptop (compare
with the Tandy 600) because the alphabet, symbol and <em>some</em>
function keys are on an obnoxious membrane on the top, with number,
scientific and the other function keys on more proper Chiclets on the
bottom. This really makes thumb typing difficult, by the way.
<p>
<p>It’s also not advisable to put it totally flat because the tiny hinge
covers on these things are under enormous tension, many have cracked
already, and they’re exceptionally difficult to repair. Once they do
crack, the hinge pin won’t stay in and starts putting pressure on the
ribbon cable between the two sides (I’ve had this happen to me as well).
Be sure either to put finger pressure over the hinge covers as you open
it to reinforce them, or cover them with a strip of sturdy tape
connecting the two halves. Don’t you keep

<p>The PC-5 has 4K of RAM on board of which 3,552 bytes are available to
the user (the 8K PC-6 in the base configuration has 7,520 bytes free). A
memory-remaining counter appears during program entry. The 3,552 bytes
can be used between the 10 BASIC program spaces, which serve more or
less as a primitive fixed filesystem, or the Data Bank, which is
effectively an on-board text editor where lines can also be optionally
treated as records with comma-separated fields.</p>

The FX-770P family has two HD61747 microcontrollers in the top half that
operate independently, the left-most CPU (the lower “B” number,
indicating its particular mask ROM identifier) being the primary
processor. It should be noted that this is not a
<em>multiprocessing</em> system because only one CPU is running at any
given time, regularly switching to the other. This is not an unusual
thing to find in pocket computers when there are significant I/O or ROM
requirements: for example, the O.G. Sharp PC-1210 and PC-1211 have two
CPUs as well which also switch back and forth because there wasn’t
enough ROM capacity in each individual microcontroller by itself. Each
HD61747 contains its own ROM, controls particular parts of the LCD and
services particular keys, communicating with the other CPU through
reserved memory locations in the common RAM pool.
<p>
<p>In the PC-5/FX-780P, the HD61747B10 on the left is the main CPU and
contains the ROM for BASIC. It services the lower keyboard and maintains
LCD character positions 1-6 and 13-18. The HD61747B11 on the right is
the secondary CPU and contains the ROM for the calculator, CAP-X/COMP-X
and the Data Bank and driving external I/O devices. It services the
upper keyboard and maintains LCD character positions 7-12 and 19-24. The
PC-6/FX-790P has HD61747B20/B25 CPUs which are functionally equivalent
to the B10/B11 except for different ROMs; the PC-5 lacks the Data Bank
search mode and obviously has a lower memory size and ceiling. (Compare
with the pathetic
<a href="https://www.floodgap.com/retrobits/tpm/4567.html">Tandy
PC-7</a> which has only one CPU, and thus lacks half the ROM, half the
display and many of the PC-5’s built-in features — including the I/O
port!)</p>

<p>The lower half contains RAM, interface logic, the I/O connector and
the power supply circuit. In the PC-5/FX-780P, RAM is provided by four
HD61914C SRAM chips containing 1K each. The HD61914 is also the RAM chip
used in the 4-bit PC-4/PB-100; despite the HD61747 being an 8-bit CPU
internally, it only exposes four data lines on the bus which is the same
as these accept. The lower board in the PC-5 has an expansion connector
that would seem to allow more RAM, probably with something like a 4K
OR-4, but the connector is blocked off with a black plastic adhesive pad
which also covers two of the SRAMs. I removed the pad for this
photograph. The PC-6 has a different connector here for Tandy’s 8K OR-8
equivalent and uses a single Hitachi HM6264A 8K SRAM instead of eight
HD61914s for its base memory.</p>

finally get to the COMP-X virtual machine itself. I’ve included
photographs of pages from the US domestic Tandy PC-5 manual. Amusingly
it comes straight out and <em>says</em> that the assembler is a

dialect comes from — and why would it? Hardly anybody in the United

The COMP-X virtual machine is a 16-bit von Neumann architecture using
signed twos-complement arithmetic in which program code and data share
the same memory and all memory access is by word (no bytes). Although by
convention the most significant bit of a COMP-X 16-bit word is numbered
0, there is no way to directly access the internal structure of a word
in pieces, and the VM therefore has no intrinsic endianness. With the
exception of a 1-bit condition code register (CC), which is really just
a flag containing the sign bit from adds and subtracts, all registers
are 16-bit as well. More or less visible to the programmer are the
condition code register (CC); the sequence counter (SC), better
understood as the program counter; the base register (BR), which is used
as the MSB of the effective address — more on that shortly; and three
general purpose registers numbered GR0 through GR3. There are no
floating point registers, no vector registers and no stack pointer, and
things like interrupts and NMIs are not defined in the spec. Execution
begins where you tell it to and the initial contents of the GPRs and
memory are undefined (in practice no implementation clears them).
<p>
<p>Two additional 16-bit registers are really an implementation detail
and aren’t observable by user programs: the instruction register (IR)
contains the value of the currently executing instruction, and the
operand register (OR) is internal storage for words fetched from memory
prior to operation. Since this is all crap anyhow, we’ll go ahead and
model these accurately in our reimplementation later, but they could
just as easily be elided away.</p>

The instruction set is extremely simple and strongly influenced by
minicomputer architectures of the era, with which it has many presumably
intentional similarities. There are only 14 major instruction types
supported by the VM, and originally just twelve. (I should note that the
history of CAP-X/COMP-X prior to 1979 or so is very murky, so for
convenience I’ve chosen to treat the spec as springing fully formed from
the head of the Emperor even though it may have gone through various
revisions now lost to history.) The architecture is not canonical
load/store because one of the operands usually comes from memory (i.e.,
the OR), with the exception of the I/O, shift (<tt>SFT</tt>) and load
immediate (<tt>LAI</tt>) instructions that use immediates. Addition,
subtraction and bitshifts are all signed.
<p>
Despite its simplicity, this set is enough to be Turing-complete and to
do all standard operations (multiplication, for example, is just
repeated addition, and division is repeated subtraction), though of
course doing so is not necessarily efficient. One of the biggest gaps is
a complete lack of register-to-register transfers, invariably requiring
a trip to memory. For logical operations, the VM offers only logical-AND
and exclusive-OR, which are not functionally complete by themselves and
can’t compute all possible Boolean operations. With logical-NOT and
logical-AND we <em>can</em> be functionally complete (effectively
logical-NAND, which is functionally complete all on its own), and we can
use exclusive-OR with a true value to implement logical-NOT, but we have
to have a constant and/or burn a register for that (load it with all one
bits). Likewise, comparisons can be implemented with subtraction, but
that also requires burning a register to receive the result. I’ll show
you some examples in a moment.
<p>
I mentioned that the architecture lacks a hardware stack, but this
wasn’t unusual in minicomputer architectures of the time either, such as
the famous DEC PDP-8. For subroutine calls the PDP-8 gets around this
problem by depositing the return address in the first word of the
destination routine, and returns jump back out through that value.
COMP-X is somewhat more advanced in that the <tt>JSR</tt> opcode lets
you designate any of the four GPRs as a link register; the current
program counter plus one is put into the specified register and the new
program counter and base register are loaded from the specified word in
memory. However, also like the PDP-8, this scheme doesn’t allow a
subroutine to be recursive without additional work. To return from a
subroutine, the temporary link register needs to be deposited in memory
somewhere so that <tt>JSR</tt> (which does double duty as the call
instruction and the return instruction — in returns, the address
previously stored to is provided as the branch target and the new “link
register” is never stored anywhere) can branch to it, and if this
location does not change between calls, it will be overwritten by later
calls just like the PDP-8’s will.
<p>
<p>Three of these instructions are unique to COMP-X. The <tt>HJ</tt>
(Halt and Jump) instruction ceases execution, leaving the program
counter pointing to the specified location. In some of our examples
we’ll abuse this feature to serve as a return value. The other two,
<tt>READ</tt> and <tt>WRITE</tt>, display and deposit the contents of
the specified GPR to the screen in the radix requested (only decimal and
hexadecimal were supported). On the pocket computer implementations,
these instructions necessarily pause execution to either allow data
entry or to make sure you can read the value on the single line LCD
before it gets replaced by something else. They were the only I/O
opcodes in the instruction set after their appearance in the
OKITEC-4300b simulator, meaning you can’t write a COMP-X “hello world”
program in the traditional sense (we’ll address this). To the best of my
knowledge, the I/O instructions never actually appeared on any version
of the ITEE and were only ever artifacts of the unofficial computer
implementations.</p>

Instructions, like data, are 16 bits wide. The opcode is in the most
significant nybble, then the GPR being referenced (2 bits), then the GPR
being used as an index (2 bits), and then an eight-bit operand, which is
usually an address. Like the much later PowerPC, COMP-X has a
<tt>mscdfr0</tt> “means something completely different for <tt>r0</tt>”
phenomenon in that GR0 can never be an index register: if the specified
index register is 0, then the index is <em>literally</em> 0, not the
value of GR0 (like those instructions in Power ISA where specifying zero
for the register is treated as zero, such as <tt>addi</tt>).
<p>
You might wonder how an eight-bit address can specify a 16-bit address,
and the answer is the base register. Although the base register is
notionally 16 bits too, its least significant byte is always zero. Once
the address is computed from the address field and the index register
(or 0), then its LSB is combined with the MSB of the base register to
yield the effective address. As it happens, only a jump to a subroutine
with <tt>JSR</tt> can change the base register; no other instruction can
modify it. This seems to be a concession to allow subroutines some sort
of data protection from their callers (that is, as long as they aren’t
called recursively or reentrantly), since one page can’t access another
page directly without calling into that page, but it also has some
important implications when we get to edge cases in the VM like when an
address or the program counter wraps.
<p>
However, you won’t need much of the base register’s range anyway because
the memory model in the Casio units is very constrained. Only up to 512
words’ addressing space is supported on the 4K PC-5 regardless of how
many bytes are currently available (i.e., just two pages), and even the
8K PC-6 only supports up to 2048 words (eight). Plus, you’ll only get
that on either machine if that much memory is actually free — if you
have less than 512 bytes of free memory, the assembler will refuse to
run at all! (At least memory expansion can help on the PC-6.) When we
get to reimplementing the VM later in this article, you’ll be able to
use a full 64kW.
<p>
<p>Because the 8-bit load immediate instruction is unsigned and clears
the MSB of the destination register, and there is no way to directly OR
or EOR a second immediate value after a bitshift (a la the load
upper-lower or load-shift-or pattern many RISCs use), loading a full
16-bit value or any negative value will always require a fetch from
memory. In practice it’s easier just to load all but small trivial
non-negative values from a separate constant pool.</p>

The CAP-X assembler format is similar to that of other assemblers, with
fields for the line label (three characters max and the first one must
be a capital letter), the instruction mnemonic, the referenced GPR, the
index GPR and an eight-bit immediate or address. However, unlike many
other assemblers, the colon separates fields, and whitespace other than
newlines is ignored — in our examples here we’ll line things up nice but
this is not required and in fact wastes memory. Memory pressure also
explains why comments aren’t supported either.
<p>
Not all fields need be specified: the index GPR is optional and
interpreted as zero if left out, and if the label field is left blank,
no label is generated (though you still need the leading colon). As
such, the particular program line in this photograph defines a label
<tt>L1</tt> at the current address and is a load instruction putting the
contents of memory location <tt>M</tt> (previously defined as a label)
into GR0. If there were an index register, it would follow the address
in CAP-X even though it’s not encoded that way in the instruction.
<p>
CAP-X also specifies a handful of assembler pseudo-ops for setting code
location (<tt>START</tt>), marking the end of subroutines and main code
(<tt>END</tt>), reserving memory words (<tt>RESV</tt>), and embedding
constants (<tt>CONST</tt> for literal constants, <tt>ADCON</tt> for
addresses and labels) in the emitted object code. Strangely, while
<tt>CONST</tt> takes its argument in hexadecimal, the other pseudo-ops
take arguments in decimal.
<p>
On the Casio systems, the Data Bank is how CAP-X assembler lines are
entered, using it in this case as the internal text editor (clear it in
MODE 1 with <tt>NEW#</tt>; press MODE 9 to enter the editor). The

<p>This program begins assembly (<tt>START</tt>) at location 0. It asks
the user for two signed base-10 numbers (numbers out of range or other
characters don’t cause an error; the VM will just ask you again),
depositing them in GR0 and GR1. Because it’s not possible to add GR1 and
GR0 together directly, we store GR1 to a temporary location we’ve
defined (<tt>TAD</tt>, marked by the <tt>RESV</tt> pseudo-op which
inserts the specified number of zero words, here one), and then add its
contents to GR0, display it to the user, and halt. The <tt>END</tt>
pseudo-op provides the default starting address to the VM and indicates
the end of assembly; all code must include it at the end. Once entered
in the Data Bank, we can now press the Asmbl key to enter the

And, after the second one is entered, the sum is reported, and the PC-5
returns to the monitor.
<p>
Let’s try a more substantial example. This one is a modified version of
an example from the manual, computing the greatest common divisor of two
values.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
L0 :READ :0:10
   :READ :1:10
   :ST   :0:M
   :ST   :1:N
L1 :LD   :0:M
   :SUB  :0:N
   :JNZ  :0:L2
   :LD   :0:M
   :WRITE:0:10
   :HJ   :0:L0
L2 :JC   :2:L3
   :LD   :0:N
   :SUB  :0:M
   :ST   :0:N
   :JC   :3:L1
L3 :ST   :0:M
   :JC   :3:L1
M  :RESV :1
N  :RESV :1
   :END  :L0
</pre>
</div>
<p>
After reading the desired values into locations M and N (I use separate
registers so that the prompt changes when an acceptable value is
entered), the program does the equivalent of comparing M and N by a
subtraction, putting the result in GR0. If GR0 ends up zero, then M ==
N, and no further iterations need to be made; the <tt>JNZ</tt> falls
through to the following instructions in which the contents of M are
shown (the greatest common divisor for both values is necessarily in
both locations because they’re equal) and the program ends. If the
result is 1, then they had no other divisors in common.
<p>
Otherwise, the CC flag is set from the most significant bit of the
result, i.e., its sign. If the CC flag is clear (tested by option 2 to
the jump conditional instruction), then the result of M - N was
positive, meaning M is greater than N, and it jumps to the code at
<tt>L3</tt> storing the current value of GR0 (that is, M - N) back into
M for another iteration (option 3 to the jump conditional instruction
means an unconditional jump). Otherwise, M must have been less than N,
so the code then computes N - M into GR0 instead and stores GR0 into N
for another iteration, looping until M == N as above.
<p>
How swiftly does all this run? While the program flow seems convoluted,
if the runtime was particularly efficient it should be possible to run
the simpler COMP-X opcodes faster than BASIC tokens, which can sometimes
be quite complex. Let’s write a version of this program that runs 100
times and time it, using a worst-case set up like 28672 and 17 (they
have no common divisor other than 1).

Almost 52 seconds. That’s absolutely potty. What about BASIC? Here is a
simpleminded conversion of the above to make the operations as similar
as possible. To make the fight fair, we’ll also cap it to two
iterations.

<p>You should be able to identify the same steps we’re taking (I’m also
modeling the same idea of putting math results into an intermediate
register like what COMP-X has to do) and the same sections of code.
Although a relatively vanilla BASIC, Casio Pocket Computer BASIC was
notable for having actual characters for not equals, greater than or
equal to, etc., instead of the more typical BASIC compound
operators.</p>

Labouriously keying it in, which really makes you wonder what Casio was
thinking with the split keyboard approach because for most of these
lines you have to jump back and forth between halves. On the other hand,
it did maintain the shifted quick entry tokens of earlier units like the
PB-100, so typing is faster than it looks.
<p>
Anyway, some of you will be expecting the big reveal that BASIC will run
rings around COMP-X. Heck, <em>I</em> was expecting that. Drum roll
please.

It’s not even close. At 52 seconds versus <em>346</em> seconds, COMP-X
does the same computations nearly <em>seven times faster</em>. There are
obvious ways to improve the BASIC code (on a quick first pass we can
rework a couple unnecessary jumps) but it’s unlikely even a maximally
optimized version would run anywhere near as quickly as the COMP-X
original. Let’s hear it for completely contrived bolted-on virtual
machines!
<p>
That said, while both programs are interpreted, they’re both also
running on a deliberately underpowered set of CPUs to eke out as much
battery life as possible, so we shouldn’t be surprised their respective
run times absolutely stink. If you want the answer quickly, go buy a
Cray.
<p>
You’ll have noticed from this example that the CC flag is <em>not</em> a
carry flag (it’s the sign bit), so how is overflow dealt with? Let’s
answer that question.

That’s right: <em>it throws a fatal exception.</em> The current value of
the sequence counter (program counter) is reported for debugging
purposes. (The result would naturally be <tt>FFFE</tt> or -2, not
+65534.) The same thing happens if we add another constant for 1 and add
that instead of itself, or if we underflow with subtraction instead —
anything that would change the sign unexpectedly will get an error.
Bafflingly, the manual says that “[o]verflow will be disregarded in this
case.” Which overflow would that be, exactly?
<p>
I get why they did this and it eliminates a particular class of bugs,
but it also makes wider sums much more difficult. If we want an unsigned
add with carry so we can handle larger numbers, we’ll need to dance
around those operations that could cause the VM to fault. Here’s one
solution, which I don’t claim is optimal nor covers all edges. It
ass-U-mes you are adding one unsigned value to another. Hold on to your
ankles:

We ask for the arguments in hex this time, since we’re dealing with
unsigned values (if we did it in base 10, it would expect signs). This
routine effectively does the addition in two steps byte by byte as we
cannot directly add the numbers together. We start with the LSBs of each
value by masking off their MSBs and store the sum, mask it again to
generate the LSB of the answer, then shift down the MSB of the original
result as the carry. We then move to adding the MSBs of each value (by
shifting them down), masking them to their LSBs since the shift is
signed, and also adding the carry from the LSBs at the same time.
<p>
At this point you’d think the remainder is merely a matter of then
shifting the MSBs back into position and OR-ing in the 8-bit sum of the
LSBs (we use an EOR, which is fine because the shift leaves a clean
lower half). However, remember shifts are <em>also</em> signed, which
would obliterate the high sign bit because these values are all
“positive,” so after the shift-and-EOR we look back at what the MSB
result was as a byte value. If this byte is 128 or higher, then we know
we need to restore the most significant bit, which we EOR on at
<tt>FIX</tt>. The routine ends with the low 16 bits of the sum in GR0
and the 17th bit in GR1, which we mask off all but the least significant
bit of before displaying the two result registers.
<p>
What a pain! Other thoughts solicited in the comments. Anyway, the usual
edge cases seem to work, like <tt>8000 + 8000</tt> correctly equals
<tt>1 0000</tt> (as does <tt>FFFF + 0001</tt>), <tt>FFFF + FFFF = 1
FFFE</tt>, <tt>7FFF + 1 = 0 8000</tt> and <tt>7FFF + 7FFF = 0 FFFE</tt>.
Subtraction is left as an exercise for the supremely masochistic reader.
<p>
Since we’ve started stepping into the bloodied buzzsaw of edge cases,
let’s look at some other dark corners of CAP-X/COMP-X. (I should also
note that the behaviour we will document in this article is observed on
the Casios, not on the less common Sharp models, and it is possible some
of the edge cases could behave differently.)
<p>
We know we can change locations we reserve in the assembler source, but
can we modify our own program code? It turns out we can, and although
self-modifying code is understandably discouraged in modern practice, in
a language this constrained the ability to do so can simplify some
tasks. First, let’s see what happens with an illegal instruction. There
are no COMP-X instructions with an opcode nybble of 7 or 9, but we can
make one with <tt>CONST</tt>.

Our next test is to substitute an invalid instruction with a valid one.
We know this will crash if it hits the bogus instruction, but if the
halt-jump replaces it, it should terminate normally (with SC set to 65).

And it does (we can see the result of SC by either dumping the registers
or “going again,” which I did here, which will use the current value).
Likewise, we get a crash by replacing a valid instruction with an
illegal one, basically reversing the two instructions in the same code:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
L  :LD   :0:OPC
   :ST   :0:PTR
PTR:HJ   :0:65
OPC:CONST:7000
   :END  :L
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This faults, as expected.
<P>
Let’s next look at the edges around effective addresses: we can modify
an address with an index register, so what happens when the result
wraps? That brings us back to the base register and how page
segmentation is implemented. In the typical case, we start with a
pointer and modify it with an index, and if it all stays in the same 256
word page, then everything occurs as expected. For example,
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
NP :CONST:0001
W  :CONST:0000
W2 :CONST:0000
   :START:128
L  :LD   :1:NP
   :LAI  :0:65
   :ST   :0:W:1
   :HJ   :0:L
   :END  :L
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<p>(Yes, you can have multiple <tt>START</tt>s. You can even have them
overlap: later code will overwrite previous code, which doesn’t seem
like a good idea.) Recall that GR0 can never be an index. We load GR1
with the index offset (1) and GR0 with a sentinel value (65), then store
GR0 to location W with GR1 added to it. At the end <tt>W</tt> remains 0
and <tt>W2</tt>, the word one up (<tt>W</tt> + 1), is 65. We can prove
that by dumping that memory location from the monitor (“object” in this
case refers to memory):</p>

This remains valid even if you pass it a negative index. If we changed
<tt>NP</tt> to <tt>FFFF</tt> (i.e., 65535, or -1 as a signed 16-bit
integer), then the effective address will be zero, and the program will
overwrite its own constant!
<p>
What if <tt>W</tt> and <tt>W2</tt> are in separate pages? I mentioned
that this is where the base register comes into play. Only the least
significant byte of the computed address is used; the most significant
byte comes from the base register. That means if you run
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
NP :CONST:0100
W  :CONST:0000
   :START:128
L1 :LD   :1:NP
   :LAI  :0:65

   :START:256
   :CONST:0200

</div>
<p>
you can’t use the pointer <tt>NP</tt> to access memory in the next page;
the store will occur to <tt>W</tt> and not <tt>W2</tt> even though our
index is 256. The same thing happens if you do
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
NP :CONST:0002
W  :CONST:0000
   :START:128
L1 :LD   :1:NP

   :START:256
   :CONST:0200

   :END  :L1

<p>
or even
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
NP :CONST:00FF
W  :CONST:0000
   :START:128
L1 :LD   :1:NP

   :HJ   :0:L1
   :START:256

W2 :CONST:0000
   :END  :L1
</pre>
</div>
<p>
That brings up this interesting situation where a pointer to word 513,
which should be illegal on a PC-5, actually turns into a pointer to word
1 <em>and overwrites itself</em>. This program terminates normally, but
will have corrupted its own bytecode in the process.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
L  :LD   :0:PTR
   :ST   :0:PTR
   :HJ   :0:0
PTR:CONST:0201
   :END   :L
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The wrapping works even if the resulting effective address is
<em>negative</em>.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
W  :CONST:0000
NP :CONST:FFFF
   :START:128
L  :LD   :1:NP
   :LAI  :0:65
   :ST   :0:W:1
   :HJ   :0:L
   :START:255
W2 :CONST:0000
   :END  :L
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This doesn’t fault either despite the fact that in signed math
65535/<tt>FFFF</tt> equals -1, making the effective address 0 + -1 ==
-1. The access remains clipped to the current page regardless, so at the
end of execution, <tt>W2</tt> at word 255 (that’s hex <tt>FF</tt> for
everybody keeping score at home) is 65.
<p>
There is simply no way to write to (or, for that matter, read from)
another page outside of the page currently executing. So … how about we
make the <em>program counter</em> wrap? Unfortunately, we get our first
clue this doesn’t make CAP-X happy when we try to simply generate code
straddling a page boundary.

This won’t even assemble; the message <tt>Error1</tt> generally comes up
when we’ve overflowed a particular tract of memory, such as the label
space or the current page.
<p>
This variant <em>will</em> assemble, and has a halt-jump at 256.
However, you’ll also notice that I’ve also put a halt-jump at 0 with a
different SC.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
   :HJ   :0:63
   :START:255
L1 :LAI  :0:0
   :START:256
   :HJ   :0:65
   :END  :L1
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The program starts at word 255. If we can wrap into the next page, we
should get a final SC of 65; if we can’t, the SC at 0 will be 63
(numbers picked randomly and have no significance otherwise). Wanna
guess what SC will be at the end? It indeed ends cleanly, but SC is 63,
not 65. This wrapping might seem inexplicable, but it was also seen on
other heavily page-oriented CPUs
<a href="/2023/01/here-be-four-bits-of-dragons-mattel.html">like the
Texas Instruments TMS1000</a>, which limits execution to the page in the
page buffer register.
<p>
What if we try to use an index register to springboard us into the next
page? Same thing:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
   :HJ   :0:63
   :START:253
L1 :LD   :1:NP
   :JC   :3:0:1
NP :CONST:0100
   :START:256
   :HJ   :0:65
   :END  :L1
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Here, we’re adding 256 to the address of zero passed to the
unconditional jump (<tt>JC:3</tt>). The program terminates cleanly, but
SC is still 63, not 65.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
   :HJ   :0:63
   :HJ   :0:64
   :START:253
L1 :LD   :1:NP
   :JC   :3:1:1
NP :CONST:00FF
   :START:256
   :HJ   :0:65
   :HJ   :0:66
   :END  :L1
</pre>
</div>
<p>
What if we just give it 255 so it all fits in the low byte and then add
255 to 1 in the unconditional jump? No dice, SC is 63 (not 64, 65 or 66
— consider why I might have put those in as checks).
<p>
This is very different from segmentation schemes like the 8086’s where
you can have multiple different paths to the same memory location and
segments can be continuous. In COMP-X the only way you’ll be able to
access data in other pages is to execute from those other pages, and
only one instruction can move execution into another page: <tt>JSR</tt>.
This snippet writes a value into the correct location by calling a
subroutine in the new page to do it. Notice that the address is still
three!
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:0
L  :LAI  :1:65

<p>
<p>This is our first use of <tt>ADCON</tt> to insert the address of the
<tt>NPC</tt> routine, since <tt>CONST</tt> (arbitrarily?) doesn’t accept
labels. Although the store <tt>NPC</tt> makes at word 257 has an address
of 3, the base register is now 1 (+256) and therefore the store goes to
<tt>W2</tt> (word 259), not <tt>W</tt> (word 3).</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

</div>
Thus, at the end, <tt>W2</tt> is finally 65 and <tt>W</tt> is 0, as
expected.
<p>
Armed with this information, we can construct code longer than one page
as long as we have this linking stanza straddling the page boundary (in
bold):
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
   :START:253
L  :LAI  :1:65
<b>   :JSR  :0:NP
NP :CONST:0100
   :START:256</b>
   :HJ   :0:65
   :END  :L
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The <tt>JSR</tt> brings execution over the line to the next page, using
the code pointer at <tt>NP</tt> (you’d have a different pointer and a
matching <tt>START</tt> for each page boundary) and throwing away the
return address in GR0, and execution ends cleanly with SC set to 65.
<p>
As inconvenient as this arrangement is, an interesting consequence is
that you can almost never have an out-of-bounds access to memory
<em>except</em> if the base register gets out of range of the allocated
maximum. That can only happen with a <tt>JSR</tt> instruction that was
given a bogus code pointer, such as
<p>
<div class="tx">

That’s the COMP-X equivalent of a segmentation fault, and the only way
such a condition can be triggered, assuming we’re dealing with a system
with less than 64kW available (like the PC-5 and PC-6). Otherwise, we
never have to worry about illegal loads and stores because we have no
way of putting instructions in an illegal page to execute — sucks for
programmers but simple for the VM designers. Strangely, unlike the other
two exceptions, this exception doesn’t provide the illegal value of the
sequence counter or what set it.
<p>
Let’s tie this room together with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski">rug</a> of a
game. I’m going to be crass enough to advance that this may be the first
game ever written for CAP-X/COMP-X. If you did one, post in the
comments. I labouriously typed this into a real PC-5, so I know it
works. The game itself is Rock, Paper, Scissors.

This first part is the game loop. It sets up its variables and asks for
your move, where 1 = paper, 2 = scissors and 3 = rock, and rock smashes
scissors, scissors cut paper and paper covers rock. It then gets a
random number and displays that as its move. It checks that the two
moves weren’t the same (using <tt>EOR</tt>; if so, tie with no score)
and that there wasn’t a paper-rock setup (if so, paper wins), and then
determines which is the higher value and awards them a point. Its score
is printed, followed by your score, and the game repeats.
<p>
The two pointers at the end are into this set of subroutines that
compute a pseudorandom number using an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift">Xorshift</a>
<a href="http://www.retroprogramming.com/2017/07/xorshift-pseudorandom-numbers-in-z80.html">16-bit
variation</a>. The first routine initializes state, and the second
generates a number between 0 and 32767. Notice we save our return
address before entering.

This somewhat abuses the likelihood of GR3 having stale data in it, and
as such employs it as a seed (ensuring it’s nonzero, of course). It then
does all the needed shifts to return another pseudorandom number, which
the game clips to the 1-3 range as its move.
<p>
<p>That’s pretty much the breadth of CAP-X/COMP-X as implemented on the
Tandy Pocket Computers, and with those kinds of bizarre limitations I
think it makes a stellar unintentional
<a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page">esoteric programming
language</a>. So much so, in fact, that I’ve reimplemented it as a
Perl-based assembler, disassembler and runtime I’ve christened “CRAP-X,”
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/crap-x">which you can find on
Github</a>. It includes full documentation of not only itself but also
CAP-X/COMP-X since most of those resources are in Japanese. There are a
few things I did improve upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The runtime now supports an addressing space of up to a full 64
kilowords.
<li>
If you specify a radix (base) of 0 to <tt>READ</tt> or <tt>WRITE</tt>,
then it will either read an ASCII character from standard input into the
register, or write an ASCII character in the register to standard
output. Now we can finally write
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/crap-x/blob/main/examples/hello.cap">a
proper hello world</a>! Sorry, even though we could support something
like UCS-2 this way, it’s currently limited to 7-bit ASCII for
simplicity.
<li>
I also added a radix (base) 1 for them as well which just shows/accepts
signed decimal numbers without all the other nonsense.
<li>
You can have comments, delimited by either <tt>;</tt> or <tt>#</tt>.
<li>
Labels can be more than three characters, though everything is still
case-insensitive.
<li>
You can specify hexadecimal addresses/immediates with a preceding
<tt>$</tt> to those instructions and pseudo-ops expecting a decimal
argument (<tt>CONST</tt> is always hex, but the <tt>$</tt> is accepted
and politely ignored if you include it).
<li>
<tt>CONST</tt> can take labels now, making <tt>ADCON</tt> more or less
into a synonym.
<p>
</ul>
If you provide the <tt>-pc5</tt> or <tt>-pc6</tt> arguments to the
assembler or runtime, then these changes are turned off and the memory
limits of the respective unit are enforced, so you can write and test
code on the Perl runtime before labouriously keying it into your
Casio-Tandy and have good confidence you aren’t using something it
doesn’t support.
<p>
The assembler reads a source file on standard input and emits binary
bytecode on standard output, with the load address, starting address and
length encoded in the first six words (all words are big-endian as
divinely intended), followed by the entire program, followed by a symbol
table. This compound file is what you pass to the runtime for execution.
By default the runtime just runs it from the starting address and
returns to your shell, but if you pass <tt>-debug</tt>, it brings up a
facsimile of the FX-series monitor instead for interactive debugging.
The disassembler is the most undeveloped of the three, but at least it
lets you see what’s in a binary.
<p>
I’ve included a few sample scripts in the demo folder. Here’s a sample
run, with two CRAP-X test scripts
(<a href="https://github.com/classilla/crap-x/blob/main/examples/hello.cap">hello
world</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/crap-x/blob/main/examples/rot13.cap">a

In the
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/crap-x/tree/main/examples/classic">classic
examples folder</a>, I’ve also included PC-5 compatible versions of the
Rock Paper Scissors game you just saw, the addition program from earlier
(both the little “hello world” one and the unsigned adder), the GCD
program from earlier, the Xorshift RNG as an endless loop of random
numbers, and even a Nim misère game I adapted from the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/The_First_Book_of_KIM/page/n45/mode/2up">First
Book of KIM</a>. I’ve also included all our test cases in
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/crap-x/tree/main/examples/edges">the
edges folder</a> so you can test them yourself.
<p>
In the
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/crap-x/tree/main/examples">full
CRAP-X examples folder</a>, you’ll find the hello world and ROT-13
programs, plus an enhanced Rock Paper Scissors with proper prompts and
inputs. To prove at least a vague sort of Turing completeness, or at
least as a bounded-storage machine, I’ve also included
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/crap-x/blob/main/examples/subleq.cap">a
Subleq machine example</a> that implements probably the most useful of
the one-instruction set computers and embeds a hello world program in
<a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Subleq">Subleq</a> that it will run.
Note that for long programs you’d need to implement separate pages with
their own copy of the Subleq interpreter and figure out some way to jump
around on branches, an exercise left for the truly obsessed.
<p>
Let’s finish the story. Given all the architecture’s idiosyncracies, in
my estimation there’s no good <em>technical</em> reason why Sharp
included CAP-X/COMP-X, especially on units that already had an (almost
certainly faster) native code execution feature. To be sure, such code
is running directly on the metal, so if you screw up it could lock up
the machine until reset or corrupt anything else in memory. However,
Sharp had already embraced this risk for great reward, particularly with
the hardcore PC-1500/Tandy PC-2, so CAP-X/COMP-X didn’t really add any
new technological capabilities and native machine language programs
would have had infinitely greater access to the hardware. With that in
mind, Sharp’s interest in the architecture appears to have been purely
for the purpose of adding just another feature.
<p>
But Casio had yet to offer support for native assembly on any of its
pocket computers up to this point. What CAP-X/COMP-X gave it was a
faster runtime that was fully trappable and protected, <em>plus</em>
(like Sharp) being a public standard by then that — at least in Japan,
anyway — was something their customer base would find worthwhile
knowing. A COMP-X program can’t run wild and trash your BASIC programs,
it can be halted with the BRK key if it gets stuck, and it can be
debugged and stepped through instruction by instruction. Sure, it was
cumbersome and convoluted, but Casio COMP-X programs were much swifter
than Casio BASIC even if you could get more BASIC code in, and unlike
naked machine code were absolutely safe to run. Now, if only Casio had
allowed you to <em>mix</em> CAP-X code and BASIC, and/or store multiple
CAP-X/COMP-X programs in memory at once like BASIC can, we could have
had the best of both worlds with faster code and BASIC convenience.
Plus, what modern standard do we know that offers you a contrived
virtual machine but has no “I/O,” so to speak,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly">of its own</a>?
<p>
It should also be observed that for as dire an assembly language as
CAP-X/COMP-X is, it was never intended to be anything other than a means
of skill assessment, and certainly not for programming in the large. As
such we really can’t blame MITI for Japanese tech companies, perceiving
a potential market in a language that likely buyers might want to learn
and required no licensing fees, sticking it in their products as a
value-added feature. It must have been worth it to those companies, too:
in 1986 MITI introduced a successor to CAP-X/COMP-X in that year’s ITEE,
which was named CASL/COMET (CASL being the assembly language, allegedly
for “Common Algebraic Specification Language,” and COMET being the
virtual machine), and within months Sharp and Casio had introduced
CASL-compatible pockets, suggesting the feature generated at least some
sales. The first CASL/COMET pocket computer, the 1986
<a href="http://pocket.free.fr/html/sharp/pc-1445_e.html">Sharp
PC-1445</a>, was virtually identical to the CAP-X/COMP-X PC-1440
otherwise, changing only the ROM and the names on the bezel and key (as
was the
<a href="http://pocket.free.fr/html/sharp/pc-1417g_e.html">PC-1417G</a>,
derived from the PC-1416G). Casio followed suit with the 1987
<a href="http://pocket.free.fr/html/casio/fx-840p_e.html">FX-840P</a>,
derived from the FX-850P, and putting the feature on the case for the
first time. However, Tandy imported neither unit, and while they were
sold in Japan and to some degree in Europe they are rather rare in the
United States. Although Casio did release one more FX-770P-based model,
the <a href="http://www.rskey.org/fx795p">FX-795P</a> in 1987 with 16K
of RAM, the CAP-X mode was completely removed and replaced with
additional specialized math operations (matrix math, calculus and even
complex numbers).
<!-- http://www.calcuseum.com/LISTINGS/CALCUSEUM_Listing_NC_FE16.htm -->
<p>
<p>CASL/COMET is similar conceptually to CAP-X/COMP-X and is also a
16-bit system, but it uses 32-bit instruction words to accommodate 23
operations, a full 16-bit address/immediate field, and an additional
fourth GPR, which also serves as the stack pointer. While still not true
load/store, it did have an instruction to load an effective address a la
Intel <tt>lea</tt> that could add the value of the specified index GPR
to the target GPR simultaneously with a constant, finally supporting
limited register-to-register math (and if the index register was zero,
it did double duty as a 16-bit load immediate). There was also no more
base register and no more segmentation, a more useful condition field
register was added, and special instructions to read and display entire
strings replaced the clumsy <tt>READ</tt> and <tt>WRITE</tt>. CPUs had
become less quirky, so CASL/COMET became less quirky too. That also made
it much nicer to program in, though correspondingly much less
interesting as an esolang.</p>

</div>
CASL/COMET had other implementations, including this one for the NEC
PC-9800 that I spotted on a Japanese auction site, but its most
interesting appearance in pocket computers was as part of the remarkable
Casio PB-1000 family. The
<a href="http://pocket.free.fr/html/casio/pb-1000_e.html">PB-1000</a>
had a much larger 192x32 dot-addressable LCD that could display four
lines of 32 characters and 8K of RAM (supporting up to 40K), and while
still based on the HD61700, Casio supported programming it directly in
assembly — except for the 1987 PB-1000C, in which Casio replaced the
HD61700 assembler with CASL/COMET. In 1989, Casio introduced the
PB-1000’s successor, the PB-2000C. This unit kept the same screen but
eliminated the clamshell and came with 32K of RAM (supporting up to 64K
with an RP-33), plus a ROM slot for cartridges. Notably, the unit is
programmable in <a href="http://www.rskey.org/pb2000c">real, honest to
goodness C</a> with an on-board compiler and editor. The cartridges
included BASIC, a surprisingly credible pocket Prolog implementation
(<a href="/search/label/casio">a subject of a future post</a>) … and
CASL/COMET.
<p>
The last CASL/COMET Casio I could find was the 1989 Casio VX-4, a
Japan-only reworking of the HD61700-based FX-870P with 18K RAM
(expandable to 50K with an RP-33) that supported BASIC, CASL/COMET and C
all in the same unit. This machine is also notable for a “secret”
built-in self-test accessible with the undocumented command <tt>SYSTEM
*</tt>. Near as I can determine, Sharp never issued any others of its
own.
<p>
In 2001 CASL/COMET was revised into CASL II and COMET II, adding more
register-to-register operations, expanding the register file, adding an
overflow condition bit, and changing the instruction mix as well as
reversing the bit order (the most significant bit is now 15). Being the
current dialect of the language on today’s ITEE, CASL/COMET II has
several open source implementations including
<a href="http://www.image.med.osaka-u.ac.jp/member/nakamoto/pycasl2/">PyCASL2/PyCOMET2</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/oguna/pycasl2-pycomet2-java">a Java
conversion</a>. But by then pocket computers had given way to PDAs and
graphing calculators and the architecture has yet to grace a handheld
from the factory again, so if you want it on your Android, I suppose
you’ll have to write it yourself. That’s good enough for a passing
grade, isn’t it?
<p>
One parting thought before we close: why on earth would MITI have put in
all these bizarre quirks? Probably because so many other contemporary
systems had similar quirks of their own and we’ve already pointed out a
few. COMP-X wasn’t supposed to be an ideal CPU — it was supposed to be a
<em>real</em> one, and real ones back then were hairy. CPUs were much
more primitive and a lot of their weird edges would be unashamedly
exposed to the programmer, and a competent IT professional of the era
would have needed to account for them. Real world code had to work and
be achievable in spite of those idiosyncrasies. Or, put more succinctly,
CAP-X/COMP-X sucks because it was <em>designed</em> to.

Foreign Minister Says Iran, US Have Exchanged Messages in Recent
Weeks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIRUT — Iran and the United States have exchanged messages
throughout Israel’s 4-month-old war on Hamas in Gaza, including about
Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, the Iranian foreign minister said
Saturday.</p>
<p>“During this war and in the recent weeks, there was an exchange of
messages between Iran and America,” Hossein Amirabdollahian said through
a translator at a news conference capping a daylong visit to Beirut.</p>
<p>He said the United States had asked Tehran to request Hezbollah,
which is backed by Iran, “not to get widely, fully involved in this war
against” Israel.</p>
<p>Hezbollah has exchanged near-daily fire with the Israeli military
along the Lebanese-Israeli frontier to support its Palestinian ally
Hamas, and it has vowed to “fight to the end” should Israel launch a
full-scare war on Lebanon.</p>
<p>Israel launched a war it says aims to destroy Hamas after the
Islamist group staged a deadly cross-border terror attack on southern
Israel on October 7.</p>
<p>The conflict has rippled across the region and earlier this month
Washington staged strikes against Iran-aligned groups in Irag, Syria and
Yemen in retaliation for a deadly attack on U.S. troops in Jordan.</p>
<p>Amirabdollahian on Saturday warned Israel against taking any steps
toward a broader war against Lebanon, saying that would be Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “last day.”</p>
<p>He also said Iran saw a political solution as the only way to end the
Gaza war.</p>
<p>“Iran and Lebanon confirm that war is not the solution, and that we
absolutely never sought to expand it,” Amirabdollahian told a news
conference earlier on Saturday alongside his Lebanese counterpart,
Abdallah Bou Habib.</p>
<p>He also said Tehran was in talks with Saudi Arabia on a political
solution to hostilities in Gaza.</p>
<p>Hamas this week proposed a ceasefire of 4-1/2 months, during which
remaining hostages held by Hamas would go free, Israel would withdraw
its troops from Gaza and agreement would be reached on an end to the
war.</p>
<p>Netanyahu called the Hamas terms “delusional” and vowed to fight on.
But Amirabdollahian said Hamas was presenting ideas based on a
“realistic view,” and that they should be widely backed in order to end
the war.</p>
<p>Amirabdollahian met on Saturday with Lebanon’s caretaker prime
minister, foreign minister, speaker of parliament and Hezbollah head
Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah Hezbollah’s Al-Manar television outlet said the
foreign minister and Nasrallah reviewed the latest developments in Gaza
and southern Lebanon, including “the near future of the situation in
Lebanon.”</p>
<p>Amirabdollahian is set to travel on to Syria, according to Syrian
media, and will meet top officials there.</p>
<p>Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps have suffered one of their most
bruising spells in Syria since arriving a decade ago to aid President
Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.</p>
<p>Since December, Israeli strikes have killed more than half a dozen of
their members, among them one of the Guards’ top intelligence
generals.</p>

So, recently I’ve been rereading old journal entries, which is
<em>always</em> playing with fire a bit, but this time I decided to try
this new thing where I ONLY read the fuckin’ hilarious entries (and the
sexy ones, after a certain point) and none of the traumatic ones and oh
my god, this way is so much better. There’s so much shit I completely
forgot about. Why is it always the bad memories that stick in your mind,
and never the good ones! Feeling a bit of nostalgic sorrow now, but
still, this has been good fun.
