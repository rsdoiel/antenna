id="declassified-us-intelligence-reveals-massive-russian-losses-in-ukraine">Declassified
US Intelligence Reveals Massive Russian Losses in Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Newly declassified U.S. intelligence indicates Russia
has suffered from some staggering losses as a result of its nearly
two-year-old invasion of Ukraine, including major setbacks during its
latest offensive.</p>
<p>The assessment, parts of which were shared with VOA, estimates more
than 13,000 Russian forces have been killed or wounded since Moscow
launched its October offensive along the Avdiivka-Novopavlivka axis in
eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence also believes Ukraine’s military has destroyed or
immobilized more than 220 Russian combat vehicles, the equivalent of six
battalions’ worth of vehicles.</p>
<p>“Russia’s attempt at an offensive has resulted in no strategic
gains,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson told VOA
in a statement, describing the Russian losses as “severe.” </p>
<p>“But Russia is determined to press forward,” she added. “Russia seems
to believe that a military deadlock through the winter will drain
Western support for Ukraine and ultimately give Russia the advantage
despite Russian losses and persistent shortages of trained personnel,
munitions, and equipment.”</p>
<p>The decision to declassify the latest intelligence Tuesday comes as
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is in Washington, visiting with
U.S. lawmakers and with U.S. President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>During a speech at the National Defense University in Washington on
Monday, Zelenskyy pleaded with U.S. lawmakers “not to betray” Ukraine’s
forces and provide more weapons and support, warning Moscow sees Ukraine
as “just a stepping-stone.”</p>
<p>“We know what to do,” he said. “You can count on Ukraine, and we hope
just as much to be able to count on you.”</p>
<p>The White House has been pushing U.S. lawmakers to approve more than
$61 billion in supplemental funding for Kyiv before the end of the
year.</p>
<p>But some lawmakers have balked, with some Republicans insisting any
deal to provide more money to Ukraine must also include provisions to
strengthen U.S. immigration policies and security along the U.S.
southern border with Mexico.</p>
<p>White House officials, however, point to the latest declassified
intelligence to argue that funding for Ukraine simply cannot wait.</p>
<p>“This shows how Ukraine is having success stopping Russian forces,
but Putin is continuing to order his troops forward,” a senior
administration official told VOA, speaking on the condition of anonymity
due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence and the political
negotiations.</p>
<p>“It’s critical we continue to support Ukraine and make sure they have
what they need to defend themselves,” the official added.</p>
<p>Top U.S. military and intelligence officials have previously said
Russia’s losses in Ukraine have set its military back by as much as five
to ten years.</p>
<p>Still, the Pentagon warned Monday a failure to back Ukraine will send
Russian President Vladimir Putin the wrong message.</p>
<p>“Despite his isolation, Putin still believes that he can outlast
Ukraine, and that he can outlast America,” Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin said Monday, speaking with Zelenskyy at the National Defense
University.  “If we do not stand up to the Kremlin’s aggression today,
if we do not deter other would-be aggressors, we will only invite more
aggression, more bloodshed, and more chaos.”</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP28, has been
broadly defined by two facts. The first is that the conference is headed
by the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/cop28-dubai-sultan-al-jaber-controversy" target="_self">CEO
of the United Arab Emirates’ state-owned oil company</a>. The second is
that this is the year of the first
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-draft" target="_self">global
stocktake</a>, a document that should, in theory, set the world on a
path to achieve the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement of 2015.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps unsurprisingly, that combination has not produced tremendous
results. The latest draft of the stocktake
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-fossil-fuel-phaseout" target="_self">dropped</a>
language calling for a fossil fuel phase-out. The condemnation was
swift: “We will not sign our death certificate,” said the Association of
Small Island States in
<a href="https://www.aosis.org/aosis-on-draft-cop-presidency-gst-text-this-cop-cannot-kill-1-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
statement</a>. “We think there are elements in the text that are fully
unacceptable,” Spain’s environment minister
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2023/dec/11/cop28-live-time-to-be-ambitious-says-president-as-summit-enters-final-days" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was curious: How, exactly, does a global stocktake come to be? To find
out, I called up
<a href="https://www.e3g.org/people/tom-evans/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tom
Evans</a>, a policy advisor and climate negotiations specialist at the
climate change think tank E3G, who is currently on the ground in Dubai.
Our conversation, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity,
is below.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Catch me up. How are things going on the ground?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It’s … going along. There’s a lot of discussions at the moment around
the text that came out yesterday. Many, many parties are dissatisfied
with the level of ambition in that text. It didn’t have the fossil fuel
phaseout, it wasn’t strong enough on things like finance or adaptation,
so that has triggered this big backlash. It’s all happening behind
closed doors at the moment with ministers and politicians talking about
the text, and the rest of us are kind of in a black box with regards to
what’s going on. But it’s all really on a knife’s edge.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What is happening behind those doors, as best as you can
tell?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The process is somewhat unclear. COPs don’t have any strict procedures;
the presidency can choose how to do this diplomacy to get to the outcome
it needs. At the moment, we’re in the phase of basically bilateral
consultations being led by the UAE. The presidency is bringing people
together behind the scenes. Everyone’s kind of slowly talking to each
other.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What do you mean by bilateral consultations, exactly?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The UAE sitting down with a party — let’s say India, for example — and
hearing their concerns and understanding what their red lines are, what
they’re looking to change in the text. And then with that knowledge
they’ll have another meeting, sitting down with, say, the U.S., having
the same conversation and trying to map out where people sit based on
these conversations.
</p>
<p>
They don’t have a big meeting room where everyone is at the table. They
haven’t done a plenary yet. Last night they did a heads of delegation
meeting, which brought all parties together. It was a closed meeting,
and it started at 10 p.m. and finished at about 2 a.m. last night, which
we hadn’t seen before.
</p>
<p>
Of course, at the same time, countries are talking to each other in
different configurations. So there are different groups who will come
together, such as the regional groups [who might have common goals]. And
the U.S., I’m sure, is talking to China and Saudi Arabia.
</p>
<p>
The UAE has other tools at their disposal — earlier this week they
hosted an informal ministerial circle where they talked about the issues
together — but at the moment, they’re choosing to do this very closed or
bilateral diplomacy, probably because the stakes are high and they need
to act sensitively around what this next iteration of text looks like.
Because an awful lot hinges upon it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>There must be some real power dynamics at play here. Are there
some countries that the UAE is more inclined to listen to than
others?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The UNFCCC is weird because some of the times those power dynamics are
different from what you might expect. Small island states and other
countries have an awful lot of power compared to [the regular UN
framework], where they’re not the geopolitical shapers. But in this
space, they have much more power because of their moral authority.
</p>
<p>
<strong>This word, “stocktake,” implies a kind of mathematical act. Is
there an emissions reckoning happening?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Stocktake is definitely a bad name — we’ve already done a lot of the
stock-taking. The past two years had the process of technical dialogues
among parties and experts and non-party stakeholders, and we had
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-5-quotes-you-need-to-know-from-the-ipcc-report" target="_self">reports
including the IPCC</a> which fed into that. Those conclusions were
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/annual-emissions-1950-2050-un" target="_self">published</a>
back in September, and that report kind of tells us what we already
know: Action is growing but inadequate, finance is not there at the
scale needed, it’s not going to the right people in the right places at
the right time. We think we know what we need to do, we just have to
find the ways to do it. How do we commit [to] things here in Dubai that
will bend the emissions curve and make sure that actions are implemented
on the ground?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Before this COP, I had the impression that the stocktake is
going to be some sort of big reckoning of past and future emissions. But
it sounds like what’s happening now is similar to how past COP
negotiations have gone. Is there something that makes the stocktake
stand out from the agreements that were negotiated at previous
COPs?</strong>
</p>
<p>
One big difference is that this is the central mechanism of the Paris
Agreement, where we take stock and assess how to close gaps to meeting
those goals. And that hasn’t happened in a formal way before.
</p>
<p>
The Paris Agreement was designed to have a stocktake so that we could
make sure that our successive action, as the years go by, was ratcheting
up, making sure that we’re not just coasting along but really delivering
stronger and stronger progress. So that’s an important part of this. We
are engaging with the Paris Agreement and saying, “okay, can we make
sure it fulfills its goals in that formal way?”
</p>
<p>
The other part of it is that the stocktake, because it’s had this
two-year process, has clearly identified the gaps. No one can deny that
we’re not doing enough on finance and that adaptation is massively
neglected. We’ve acknowledged that there’s been some progress on
emission reductions, but it’s just an incremental push towards what’s
needed. Those conclusions have a certain weight that we can draw from.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What happens if there is no agreement? Is that an option?
</strong>
</p>
<p>
I don’t think that is an option. No agreement would be a failure, a
clear sign of an inability of the parties to rise to the challenge of
what’s needed. There’s obviously a difficult question about what level
of agreement is not good enough, but that’s the reason why the parties
are working so hard right now to rescue this — because the deal on the
table at the moment was clearly falling below that line. That’s why we
saw the backlash.
</p>
<p>
The UAE certainly will be aware that that is what’s at stake. It’s their
presidency, they need to deliver what they set out to do. They need to
be able to show the final success. After a year of many pledges and
announcements, new money, new initiatives — all of that is important,
but it doesn’t count unless you negotiate this final outcome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>And every party has to agree to the final outcome?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It has to be <em>consensus</em>, though what exactly consensus means can
be debated. Everyone would have to <em>not</em> object. The weird state
of the UNFCCC process means that sometimes there have been things which
aren’t necessarily fully agreed 100% but still reached consensus.
</p>
<p>
Consensus isn’t perfect. It’s a political call, it’s not a mathematical
number game where you tally up votes. For example, even this year, when
the parties agreed [to] the loss and damage fund, the U.S. said in that
meeting that they didn’t agree to it. But they said they weren’t in the
room when consensus was reached, because the negotiator had left the
room temporarily, so an agreement was reached and they approved it here
in Dubai.
</p>
<p>
So there’s ways you can play with the system and survive. There have
been instances in the past I’ve heard many years ago where decisions
have been gaveled through despite objection because the presidency felt
confident that the objections were not sufficient to obstruct the
outcome.
</p>
<p>
<strong>This is the first stocktake process. Do you think part of what’s
making it so hard is that there is no previous framework?</strong>
</p>
<p>
To an extent we’re creating something new, trying to do this for the
first time. But I think also, it’s the politics. We are looking at the
hardest issue, and for the first time in years getting on the edge of
agreeing [to] something like a fossil fuel phaseout. And that brings up
deep challenges for countries who are extremely dependent on fossil
fuels. That’s true on all sides — not just producers, but also
consumers.
</p>
<p>
We’re talking about initiating a model for the world which doesn’t have
fossils in it. And that’s never been done — even in countries who have
decarbonized to a great degree, they have not been able to show how that
works at an international level.
</p>
<p>
So it is a huge ask, and there is no doubt that there can be challenges
when trying to do that. And that’s what we’re seeing. We’re seeing the
pains of trying to get something that’s useful. We’re no longer
negotiating a treaty like we were in Paris. We’re no longer agreeing on
a rulebook, which we did for five years up until COP26. We’re now really
firmly talking about implementation. What does it mean to deliver the
Paris Agreement? What does it mean to actually reduce emissions, not
just pledge targets? So obviously it’s going to be a painful
conversation, but it’s a difficult and important one.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there a misconception or something frustrating about this
process that you wish people knew more about?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I think the biggest frustration is that this isn’t about just a
technical exercise where you’re like, “oh, we need to phase out fossil
fuels, because that’s what is needed.” I mean, that’s true. But there’s
a deeper question here of “how does the Paris Agreement work?”
</p>
<p>
The Paris Agreement works on the basis of a deal that if we have
finance, if we have cooperation, if we have means to deliver action,
[then] we can do more ambitious things, we can raise and accelerate
action. That is what is at stake here. So when we’re talking about
phasing out fossil fuels, we should also be asking, where’s the
financial pathway to do that? When we’re talking about trying to make
sure that countries have more adaptation, where is the money on the
table to do that? And at the moment, we know it’s a drop in the ocean.
These are the contours of the deal that we need to really examine.
</p>
<p>
And it won’t be all sealed here. It goes on and on until COP30 and after
that. But the global stocktake is, I think, like a marriage vow renewal.
You need to kind of renew the trust and the faith that that deal, that
system’s working. And right now it’s looking like maybe a shaky
marriage.

An Epic antitrust loss for Google (12 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links An Epic antitrust loss for Google: They can’t help but
put it in writing. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in
history: 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading
An Epic antitrust loss for Google (permalink) A jury just found Google
guilty on all counts of antitrust violations stemming from its dispute
with Epic, maker of Fortnite, which brought a variety of claims related
to how Google runs its app marketplace. This is huge:
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/technology/epic-games-google-antitrust-ruling.html
The mobile app store world is a duopoly run by Google and Apple. Both
use a variety of tactics to prevent their customers from installing
third party app stores, which funnels all app makers into their own app
stores. Those app stores cream an eye-popping 30% off every purchase
made in an app. This is a shocking amount to charge for payment
processing. The payments sector is incredibly monopolized and notorious
for its price-gouging – and its standard (wildly inflated) rate is 2-5%:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/04/owning-the-libs/#swiper-no-swiping
Now, in theory, Epic doesn’t have to sell in Google Play, the official
Android app store. Unlike Apple’s iOS, Android permit both sideloading
(installing an app directly without using an app store) and configuring
your device to use a different app store. In practice, Google uses a
variety of anticompetitive tricks to prevent these app stores from
springing up and to dissuade Android users from sideloading. Proving
that Google’s actions – like paying Activision $360m as part of “Project
Hug” (no, really!) – were intended to prevent new app storesfrom
springing up was a big lift for Epic. But they managed it, in large part
thanks to Google’s own internal communications, wherein executives
admitted that this was exactly why Project Hug existed. This is part of
a pattern with Big Tech antitrust: many of the charges are theoretically
very hard to make stick, but because the companies put their evil plans
in writing (think of the fraudulent crypto exchange FTX, whose top execs
all conferred in a groupchat called “Wirefraud”), Big Tech keeps losing
in court:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/03/big-tech-cant-stop-telling-on-itself/
Now, I do like to dunk on Big Tech for this kind of thing, because it’s
objectively funny and because the companies make so many unforced
errors. But in an important sense, this kind of written record is
impossible to avoid. Any large institution can only make and enact
policy through administrative systems, and those systems leave behind a
paper-trail: memos, meeting minutes, etc. Yes, we all know that quote
from The Wire: “Is you taking notes on a fucking criminal conspiracy?”
But inevitably, any ambitious conspiracy can only exist if someone is
taking notes. What’s more, any large conspiracy involving lots of
parties will inevitably produce leaks. Think of this as the corollary to
the idea that the moon landing can’t be a hoax, because there’s no way
400,000 co-conspirators could keep the secret. Big Tech’s conspiracies
required hundreds or even thousands of collaborators to keep their
mouths shut, and eventually someone blabs:

This is part of a wave of antitrust cases being brought against the tech
giants. As Matt Stoller writes, the guilty-on-all-counts jury verdict
will leak into current and future actions. Remember, Google spent much
of this year in court fighting the DoJ, who argued that the company
bribed Apple not to make a competing search engine, paying tens of
billions every year to keep a competitor from emerging. Now that a jury
has convinced Google of doing that to prevent alternative app stores
from emerging, claims that it used these pay-for-delay tactics in other
sectros get a lot more credible:
https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/boom-google-loses-antitrust-case On
that note: what about Apple? Epic brought a very similar case against
Apple and lost. Both Apple and Epic are appealing that case to the
Supreme Court, and now that Google has been convicted in a similar case,
it might prompt the Supremes to weigh in and resolve the seeming
inconsistencies in the interpretation of federal law. This is a key
moment in the long project to wrest antitrust away from the pro-monopoly
side, who spent decades “training” judges to produce verdicts that run
counter to the plain language of America’s antitrust law:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down There’s 40
years’ worth of bad precedent to overturn. The good news is that we’ve
got the law on our side. Literally, the wording of the laws and the
records of the Congressional debate leading to their passage, all
militate towards the (incredibly obvious) conclusion that the purpose of
anti-monopoly law is to fight monopoly, not defend it:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/14/aiming-at-dollars/#not-men It’s
amazing to realize that we got into this monopoly quagmire because
judges just literally refused to enforce the law. That’s what makes one
part of the jury verdict against Google so exciting: the jury found that
Google’s insistence that Play Store sellers use its payment processor
was an act of illegal tying. Today, “tying” is an obscure legal theory,
but few doctrines would be more useful in disenshittifying the internet.
A company is guilty of illegal tying when it forces you to use unrelated
products or services as a condition of using the product you actually
want. The abandonment of tying led to a host of horribles, from printer
companies forcing you to buy ink at $10,000/gallon to Livenation forcing
venues to sell tickets through its Ticketmaster subsidiary. The next
phase of this comes when the judge decides on the penalty. Epic doesn’t
want cash damages – it wants the judge to order Google to fulfill its
promise of “an open, competitive Android ecosystem for all users and
industry participants.” They’ve asked the judge to order Google to
facilitate third-party app stores, and to separate app stores from
payment processors. As Stoller puts it, they want to “crush Google’s
control over Android”:
https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-v-google-trial-verdict-a-win-for-all-developers
Google has sworn to appeal, surprising no one. The Times’s expert says
that they will have a tough time winning, given how clear the verdict
was. Whatever this means for Google and Android, it means a lot for a
future free from monopolies. Hey look at this (permalink) An Influencer

<p class="drop-caps">
In the weeks leading up to Elon Musk’s latest round of controversies,
27% percent of Americans who reported wanting to buy an EV in the future
said that the billionaire’s behavior made them less likely to pick a
Tesla, down from 36% who said the same in February. On the other hand,
35% of prospective EV buyers said that Musk had made them <em>more</em>
likely to purchase a Tesla — a reversal of the results from the last
time <em>Heatmap</em>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/elon-musk-is-alienating-future-tesla-buyers-heatmap-poll-finds" target="_self">took
Americans’ temperature</a> on the controversial CEO, when more people
were put off by Musk’s behavior than swayed by him.

<p>
<em>Heatmap</em>’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">new
poll</a> — which was conducted by Benenson Strategy Group between Nov. 6
and Nov. 13, 2023 — notably did not account for Musk’s latest scandal:
reinstating <em>Infowars</em> founder and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/us/politics/heres-what-jones-has-said-about-sandy-hook.html" target="_blank">Newtown
massacre denialist</a> Alex Jones to the website formerly known as
Twitter. The poll was also
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/technology/elon-musk-endorses-antisemitic-post-ibm.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conducted
days before</a> Musk endorsed an anti-semitic post on X, leading to an
advertiser exodus from the platform.
</p>
<p>
Still, since the last <em>Heatmap</em> poll in February, Americans have
had plenty of time to see other negative headlines about Musk, including
around his volatile
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/10/elon-musk-twitter-x-one-year-everything-he-ruined.html" target="_blank">ownership
of X</a>, his
“<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23863157/elon-musk-ukraine-twitter-starlink-isaacson" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">outsize

President
<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/billionaire-elon-musk-mocks-ukraine-president-zelenskyy-asking-aid-with-meme/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Volodymyr
Zelensky</a>, and his public attacks on

<p>
Even so, Tesla outsold its next 19 rival EV automakers combined, and by
a wide margin, in the first six months of 2023,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-rivals-scrap-thin-slices-us-ev-sales-2023-09-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em>
reports</a>. And despite declining earnings, its shares have risen 94%
so far this year, far outpacing the S&amp;P 500. When trying to account
for this resilience in the face of Musk’s parade of recent scandals,
<em>Platformer</em>’s Casey Newton
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/podcasts/hardfork-google-gemini-cybertruck.html?showTranscript=1" target="_blank">mused</a>
last week on <em>The New York Times</em>’ <em>Hard Fork</em> podcast
that there might still be “a contingent of folks who want to believe
that the Elon Musk of 2023 is the Elon Musk of 2013, and that he said a
couple of kooky things here and there, but at his core, he’s billionaire
genius, Tony Stark, savior of humanity.” But at the same time, he went
on, this might be a “moment in the sun for Tesla” and “maybe a few years
from now, we look back and we think, oh yeah, that’s when the wheels
started to come off the wagon.”
</p>
<p>
Overall, <em>Heatmap</em> found that some 39% of Democrats and
left-leaning Independents said Musk has made them less likely to look at
a Tesla, a small drop from 44% who said the same in February. Only 17%
of Republicans and right-leaning Independents said the same. Of all
respondents surveyed, though, a plurality (46%) said Musk ultimately has
“no impact” on their decision to buy or lease a Tesla, proving there
apparently are some people lucky enough to
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/14/23600358/elon-musk-tweets-algorithm-changes-twitter" target="_blank">not
have to think about this guy</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, 35% of men but only 15% of women said that Musk has made
them more likely to buy a Tesla. Make of that what you will!

Now, de Vries’
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004"><i>Bitcoin’s
growing water footprint</i></a> reveals that supporting
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/05/the-cryptocurrency-use-case.html">gambling,
money laundering and crime</a> causes yet another massive waste of
resources.<br /> <br /> But that’s not all. de Vries has joined a
growing chorus of researchers showing that the VC’s <i>pivot to AI</i>
wastes similar massive amounts of power. Can analysis of AI’s e-waste
and water consumption be far behind?<br /> <br /> Below the fold I
discuss papers by de Vries and others on this issue.<br />
<span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> First, de Vries examines the
problem highlighted by Jacky Sawicky of the
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/10/23/texans-versus-bitcoin-jackie-sawicky-and-the-texas-coalition-against-cryptomining/">Texas
Coalition Against Cryptomining</a>, water usage by Riot Blockchain’s
massive Texas mining operation:<br />
<blockquote>
Corsicana will sell Riot the water. Jackie only discovered how much
water Riot needed via records requests. “They asked for 1.6 million
gallons a day in the height of the summer, and we are all being told to
conserve,” Jackie said.<br /> <br /> “When Riot tells people they are
going to be wasting 1.6 million gallons a day, more than the iron smelt,
more than the candy factory, they are going to be the number one user of
water,” said Jackie.
</blockquote>
In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004"><i>Bitcoin’s
growing water footprint</i></a> Alex de Vries discovers some very large
water losses:<br />
<blockquote>
Amid growing concerns over the impacts of climate change on worldwide
water security, Bitcoin’s water footprint has rapidly escalated in
recent years. The water footprint of Bitcoin in 2021 significantly
increased by 166% compared with 2020, from 591.2 to 1,573.7 GL. The
water footprint per transaction processed on the Bitcoin blockchain for
those years amounted to 5,231 and 16,279 L, respectively. As of 2023,
Bitcoin’s annual water footprint may equal 2,237 GL.
</blockquote>
That is, each Bitcoin transaction consumes a
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/a-single-bitcoin-transaction-uses-enough-water-to-fill-a-swimming-pool/ar-AA1kJBzC">small
swimming pool worth</a> of water.<br /> <br /> de Vries
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">computes two kinds
of losses</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The first involves onsite (direct) water use for cooling systems and air
humidification. Water usage depends on cooling system types and local
climate conditions. It is important to differentiate between water
withdrawal and water consumption in terms of this usage. Water
withdrawal pertains to the water taken from surface water or groundwater
sources, while water consumption refers to the portion of water that
becomes unavailable for reuse after withdrawal, primarily due to
evaporation in cooling systems. Water consumption is not extensively
studied in Bitcoin mining or generic data center research, as reliable
data on water consumption factors are challenging to obtain.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">And</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The second way in which miners use water relates to the (indirect) water
consumption associated with generating the electricity necessary to
power their devices. Thermoelectric power generation plays a major role
in water consumption, as a portion of the withdrawn water for cooling
purposes evaporates (unless dry cooling technologies utilizing air are
employed).
</blockquote>
Note some
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">caveats</a> (my
emphasis):<br />
<blockquote>
These systems can utilize both freshwater and non-freshwater sources.
This commentary, however, exclusively focuses on freshwater
<i>consumption</i>. … The total water footprint of Bitcoin examined in

It is important to note that water consumed is not the only concern,
withdrawn water can be too.

points out that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The water gets quite hot — over 100 degrees Fahrenheit — and that hot
water needs to go somewhere. Where will it go?<br /> <br /> Jackie
hasn’t been able to get a clear answer, but she has concerns. “The
property Riot purchased here in Navarro Country feeds into Richland
Creek and Richland Creek feeds into Richland-Chambers Reservoir, and
that’s the tap water for Arlington-Fort Worth.”
</blockquote>
Hot water kills fish, and any pollution from the Riot facility will end
up in the water supply.<br /> <br />

The US hosts a significant part of the total Bitcoin mining fleet. The

York Times</i> list</a> of
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">large US
miners</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
includes 34 Bitcoin mines, with the power requirement for each mine
ranging from 38 to 450 megawatts (MW) as of March 2023. Together, these
34 mines are responsible for 3.91 GW of power demand, representing
roughly a quarter of Bitcoin’s total estimated power demand in the same
month (i.e., 16.2 GW) and a majority of the share that can be attributed
to the US according to the CCAF (i.e., 37.84% as of January 2022).
</blockquote>
de Vries <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crsus.2023.100004">estimates
that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This means the total water footprint of US Bitcoin miners, after adding
their direct water consumption, could be an annual 93–120 GL, which is
10%–41% more than the estimated indirect water consumption of 84.9 GL
per year. It also means the total water footprint of US Bitcoin miners
could be equivalent to the average annual water consumption of around
300,000 US households, comparable with a city such as Washington, DC.

Thus only about <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396">10% are
“economically meaningful”</a> transactions between individuals and

liters of water per year. So each economically meaningful Bitcoin
transaction consumes almost our annual electricity usage, about 6 weeks
of our e-waste generation, and about 70% of our annual water

pivots to AI. In
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004"><i>The growing
energy footprint of artificial intelligence</i></a> he starts with the
notoriously compute-intensive training phase:<br />
<blockquote>
Hugging Face reported that its BigScience Large Open-Science Open-Access
Multilingual (BLOOM) model consumed 433 MWh of electricity during
training.4 Other LLMs, including GPT-3, Gopher and Open Pre-trained
Transformer (OPT), reportedly used 1,287, 1,066, and 324 MWh,
respectively, for training. Each of these LLMs, was trained on terabytes
of data and has 175 billion or more parameters.
</blockquote>
de Vries then turns to the less-studied
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">inference
phase</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Research firm SemiAnalysis suggested that OpenAI required 3,617 of
NVIDIA’s HGX A100 servers, with a total of 28,936 graphics processing
units (GPUs), to support ChatGPT, implying an energy demand of 564 MWh
per day. Compared to the estimated 1,287 MWh used in GPT-3’s training
phase, the inference phase’s energy demand appears considerably higher.
Furthermore, Google reported that 60% of AI-related energy consumption
from 2019 to 2021 stemmed from inference.
</blockquote>
He estimates for Google the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">energy needed per
inference in LLMs</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
SemiAnalysis estimated that implementing AI similar to ChatGPT in each
Google search would require 512,821 of NVIDIA’s A100 HGX servers,
totaling 4,102,568 GPUs. At a power demand of 6.5 kW per server, this
would translate into a daily electricity consumption of 80 GWh and an
annual consumption of 29.2 TWh. New Street Research independently
arrived at similar estimates, suggesting that Google would need
approximately 400,000 servers, which would lead to a daily consumption
of 62.4 GWh and an annual consumption of 22.8 TWh. With Google currently
processing up to 9 billion searches daily, these scenarios would average
to an energy consumption of 6.9–8.9 Wh per request. This estimate aligns
with Hugging Face’s BLOOM model, which consumed 914 kWh of electricity
for 230,768 requests,4 averaging to 3.96 Wh per request.<br /> …<br />
Alphabet’s chairman indicated in February 2023 that interacting with an
LLM could ’’likely cost 10 times more than a standard keyword search.6”
As a standard Google search reportedly uses 0.3 Wh of electricity,9 this
suggests an electricity consumption of approximately 3 Wh per LLM
interaction.
</blockquote>
And similarly for
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2023.09.004">ChatGPT</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
SemiAnalysis’ assessment of ChatGPT’s operating costs in early 2023,
which estimated that ChatGPT responds to 195 million requests per day,
requiring an estimated average electricity consumption of 564 MWh per
day, or, at most, 2.9 Wh per request.

de Vries considers a worst-case scenario in which <i>every</i> search
involved interacting with an LLM:<br />
<blockquote>
In 2021, Google’s total electricity consumption was 18.3 TWh, with AI
accounting for 10%–15% of this total. The worst-case scenario suggests
Google’s AI alone could consume as much electricity as a country such as
Ireland (29.3 TWh per year),
</blockquote>
Fortunately, the hardware supply chain can’t deliver the chips needed to
do this, and even if it could Google would not want to make the roughly
$100B investment. A more realistic scenario is based on Nvidia’s
projected sales of 100,000 AI servers in 2023:<br />
<blockquote>
these servers would have a combined power demand of 650–1,020 MW. On an
annual basis, these servers could consume up to 5.7–8.9 TWh of
electricity. Compared to the historical estimated annual electricity
consumption of data centers, which was 205 TWh, this is almost
negligible.
</blockquote>
Note that this estimate assumes 100% duty cycle but ignores the power
needed to cool the servers, two effects which tend to cancel each other.
It also ignores the embedded energy in the servers, and their eventual
contribution to the e-waste problem. de Vries concludes:<br />
<blockquote>
While the exact future of AI-related electricity consumption remains
difficult to predict, the scenarios discussed in this commentary
underscore the importance of tempering both overly optimistic and overly
pessimistic expectations. Integrating AI into applications such as
Google Search can significantly boost the electricity consumption of
these applications. However, various resource factors are likely to
restrain the growth of global AIrelated electricity consumption in the
near term. Simultaneously, it is probably too optimistic to expect that
improvements in hardware and software efficiencies will fully offset any
longterm changes in AI-related electricity consumption. These
advancements can trigger a rebound effect whereby increasing efficiency
leads to increased demand for AI, escalating rather than reducing total
resource use.

de Vries’ pivot to the cost of AI inference is joined by Alexandra Sasha
Luccioni, Yacine Jernite and Emma Strubell with
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf"><i>Power Hungry
Processing: Watts Driving the Cost of AI Deployment?</i></a> who:<br />
<blockquote>
propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of
various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific
(i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and
‘general-purpose’ models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We
measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to
perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these
models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders
of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of
tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters.
</blockquote>
As with de Vries, they justify their
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf">focus on
inference</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
According to AWS, the largest global cloud provider, inference is
estimated to make up 80 to 90% of total ML cloud computing demand [2,
28], whereas a 2021 publication by Meta attributed approximately
one-third of their internal end-to-end ML carbon footprint to model
inference, with the remainder produced by data management, storage, and
training [56]; similarly, a 2022 study from Google attributed 60% of its
ML energy use to inference, compared to 40% for training [40].
</blockquote>
Luccioni <i>et al</i>’s Figure 1 (note Y axis logarithmic) shows that
the range of carbon emissions for the various tasks they tested spans 3
orders of magnitude. Generative tasks are by far more expensive, with
image generation particularly costly.<br /> <br />

They report that although increasing model size increases emissions, the
effect is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf">less than that
of the task</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
We do observe a relationship between model size and quantity of
emissions produced during inference, with differing progressions for
each modality – however, the task structure accounts for more of the
variation than the model size does. We can observe once again that
text-to-image is by far the most carbon- and energy-intensive task, with
smaller image generation models such as <tt>segmind/tiny-sd</tt> that
have around 500M parameters producing magnitudes more carbon than
text-to-category models (100g vs. 0.6 g of CO 2 per 1,000
inferences).<br /> …<br /> For context, the most carbon-intensive image
generation model <tt>(stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)</tt> generates 1,594
grams of CO 2 for 1,000 inferences, which is roughly the equivalent to
4.1 miles driven by an average gasoline-powered passenger vehicle.
</blockquote>
They <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16863.pdf">conclude</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<i>Using multi-purpose models for discriminative tasks is more
energy-intensive compared to task-specific models for these same
tasks.</i> This is especially the case for text classification (on IMDB,
SST 2 and Rotten Tomatoes) and question answering (on SciQ, SQuAD v1 and
v2), where the gap between task-specific and zero-shot models is
particularly large, and less so for summarization (for CNN-Daily Mail,
SamSUM and XSum). As can be seen in Table 4, the difference between
multi-purpose models and task-specific models is amplified as the length
of output gets longer.<br /> …<br /> While we see the benefit of
deploying generative zero-shot models given their ability to carry out
multiple tasks, we do not see convincing evidence for the necessity of
their deployment in contexts where tasks are well-defined, for instance
web search and navigation, given these models’ energy requirements.

One of the most-hyped applications of AI is
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/robotaxi-economics.html">autonomous
vehicles</a>, and Soumya Sudhakar, Vivienne Sze and Sertac Karaman
examine their externalities in
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MM.2022.3219803"><i>Data Centers on
Wheels: Emissions From Computing Onboard Autonomous Vehicles</i></a>
which is summarized by Brandon Vigliarolo in
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/13/selfdriving_car_computers_could_equal/"><i>Self-driving
car computers may be ‘as bad’ for emissions as datacenters</i></a>.
Sudhakar <i>et al</i> use probabilistic models to estimate the power
needed for autonomous navigation:<br />
<blockquote>
Based on current trends, a widespread AV adoption scenario where
approximately 95% of all vehicles are autonomous requires computer power
to be less than 1.2 kW for emissions from computing on AVs to be less
than emissions from all data centers in 2018 in 90% of modeled
scenarios. Anticipating a future scenario with high adoption of AVs,
business-as-usual decarbonization, and workloads doubling every three
years, hardware efficiency must double every 1.1 years for emissions in
2050 to equal 2018 data center emissions. The rate of increase in
hardware efficiency needed in many scenarios to contain emissions is
faster than the current rate.
</blockquote>
Again, note that in aggregate autonomous vehicles will consume far more
power in inference than in training.<br /> <br />

History shows that the efficiency of the on-board computers in
autonomous vehicles has doubled every 2.8 years. Their models, using
plausible assumptions as to parameters such as the adoption rate of the
technology, and the growth of the navigation workload, show that unless
the hardware efficiency increases much faster emissions from autonomous
vehicles will rapidly eclipse the total from all data centers in 2018.
For example, their Figure 1 shows:<br />

Emissions from computing onboard AVs driving 1 h/day. With one billion

it’s so hard to actually get U.S. visas and green cards</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The immigration system in the U.S. has not been significantly updated in
decades. Today, we examine what pathways look like for immigrants who
want to work in the States and for the employers who want to hire them.
Also on the show: Price increases seem to be settling in higher than the
Federal Reserve wants, small business optimism ticks down in November,
and the UAW goes after non-union automakers.

President Remains Leader of Ivy League School Following Backlash on
Antisemitism Testimony</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Harvard President Claudine Gay will remain leader
of the prestigious Ivy League school following her comments last week at
a congressional hearing on antisemitism, the university’s highest
governing body announced Tuesday. </p>
<p>“Our extensive deliberations affirm our confidence that President Gay
is the right leader to help our community heal and to address the very
serious societal issues we are facing,” the Harvard Corporation said in
a statement following its meeting Monday night. </p>
<p>Only months into her leadership, Gay came under intense scrutiny
following the hearing in which she and two of her peers struggled to
answer questions about campus antisemitism. Their academic responses
provoked a backlash from Republican opponents, along with alumni and
donors who say the university leaders are failing to stand up for Jewish
students on their campuses. </p>
<p>Some lawmakers and donors to the university called for Gay to step
down, following the resignation of Liz Magill as president of the
University of Pennsylvania on Saturday. </p>
<p>The Harvard Crimson student newspaper first reported Tuesday that
Gay, who became Harvard’s first Black president in July, will remain in
office with the support of the Harvard Corporation following the
conclusion of the board’s meeting. It cited an unnamed source familiar
with the decision. </p>
<p>A petition signed by more than 600 faculty members asked the school’s
governing body to keep Gay in charge. </p>
<p>“So many people have suffered tremendous damage and pain because of
Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, and the university’s initial statement
should have been an immediate, direct, and unequivocal condemnation,”
the corporation’s statement said. “Calls for genocide are despicable and
contrary to fundamental human values. President Gay has apologized for
how she handled her congressional testimony and has committed to
redoubling the university’s fight against antisemitism.” </p>
<p>In an interview with The Crimson last week, Gay said she got caught
up in a heated exchange at the House committee hearing and failed to
properly denounce threats of violence against Jewish students. </p>
<p>“What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was
return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our
Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at
Harvard, and will never go unchallenged,” Gay said. </p>
<p>Testimony from Gay and Magill drew intense national backlash, as have
similar responses from the president of MIT, who also testified before
the Republican-led House Education and Workforce Committee. </p>
<p>The corporation also addressed allegations of plagiarism against Gay,
saying that Harvard became aware of them in late October regarding three
articles she had written. It initiated an independent review at Gay’s
request. </p>
<p>The corporation reviewed the results on Saturday, “which revealed a
few instances of inadequate citation” and found no violation of
Harvard’s standards for research misconduct, it said.</p>

<p><span

spaceships; I just want my music</span></p>
<pre><code>        &lt;div class=&quot;clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks ago, as my kids settled into the car, I asked like I always do, &quot;what songs do you want me to play?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
They have a range of favored earworms, from Baby Shark to Babaloo, and
usually the songs are tolerable, at least.
</p>
<p>
But a few albums, like Bluey’s soundtrack, transcend the children’s
genre. They’re genuinely fun to listen to, for everyone in the car.
</p>
<p>
Well, that fine day, the kids chose Ladybug Music. And let me tell you,
besides a few duds, Ladybug Music <em>slaps</em>. And the songs
incorporate diverse styles, too, it’s not just the same nursery rhymes
regurgitated in a bubbly voice.
</p>
<p>
So I found the album on my phone and noticed the songs were all greyed
out.
</p>
<p>
I tapped one, and <em>nothing</em>. Just this notice:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/song-not-available.jpg" width="700" height="auto" class="insert-image" alt="Song not available Apple Music on iPhone" />
</p>
<p>
Not available in my region? Well, that’s weird. I pay for Apple Music.
And I know the artist is in the US, and <em>I’m</em> in the US…

Negotiators at the COP28 climate summit remain divided over the text
that will appear in the final deal to emerge from the conference, and in
particular whether the text will call on countries to phase out fossil
fuels. The conference was scheduled to end this morning but is running
into overtime. Yesterday an updated draft text was swiftly and widely
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-fossil-fuel-phaseout" target="_blank">condemned</a>
in part because it eliminated the “phase out” language in an attempt to
appease Saudi Arabia, among other nations. This morning COP28 Director
General Majid Al Suwaidi said that draft was just a starting point for
talks. He added that the United Arab Emirates COP presidency
<a href="wants%20the%20text%20to%20include%20fossil%20fuels" target="_blank">wants
the text to include fossil fuels</a> but that in the end, it will be up
to the nations in attendance to come to an agreement. A new draft of the
text is expected sometime today.

<p>It’s not about innovating; it’s about surviving. With the rise of
conversational search, media outlets will have to move on from obsessing
over the Google algorithm. Even if the reach provided by Google
maintains its pace, the real success needle for media shouldn’t be
vanity reach, but cultural relevance. In the content industry, what

of Hawaii’s Historic Lahaina, Burned in Wildfire, Reopens to Residents,
Business Owners</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LAHAINA — The heart of Lahaina, the historic town on the Hawaiian
island of Maui that burned in a deadly wildfire that killed at least 100
people, reopened Monday to residents and business owners holding day
passes.</p>
<p>The renewed access marks an important emotional milestone for victims
of the Aug. 8 fire, but much work remains to be done to safely clear
properties of burned debris and rebuild.</p>
<p>The reopened areas include Banyan Tree Park, home to a 150-year-old
tree that burned in the fire but that is now sprouting new leaves,
Lahaina’s public library, an elementary school and popular
restaurants.</p>
<p>An oceanfront section of Front Street, where the fire ripped through
a traffic jam of cars trying to escape town, reopened Friday.</p>
<p>Authorities are continuing to recommend that people entering scorched
lots wear protective gear to shield them from hazards.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the state Department of Health released test results
confirming the ash and dust left by the fire is toxic and that arsenic
is the biggest concern. Arsenic is a heavy metal that adheres to
wildfire dust and ash, the department said.</p>
<p>The tests examined ash samples collected Nov. 7-8 from 100 properties
built from the 1900s to the 2000s. Samples also showed high levels of
lead, which was used to paint houses built before 1978.</p>
<p>The clean up is still in its early stages. For the past few months,
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been removing batteries,
propane tanks, pesticides and other hazards from the town’s more than
2,000 destroyed buildings.</p>
<p>Residents and business owners have been able to visit their
properties after the EPA has finished clearing their lots. In some
cases, residents — often wearing white full-body suits, masks and gloves
— have found family heirlooms and mementos after sifting through the
charred rubble of their homes.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will begin hauling away the
remaining debris and take it to a landfill after it gets permission from
property owners.</p>
<p>The EPA and the state’s health department have installed 53 air
monitors in Lahaina and Upcountry Maui, where a separate fire burned
homes in early August. The department is urging people to avoid outdoor
activity when monitor levels show elevated air pollution and to close
windows and doors.</p>

<p>As is sometimes the case in American politics, a bill that many
people are likely not paying a great deal of attention to is likely to
have enormous impact on the nation’s future. That $110.5 billion
national security supplemental package was designed to provide
additional funding for Ukraine in its war to fight off Russia’s
invasion; security assistance to Israel, primarily for missile defense
systems; humanitarian assistance to citizens in Gaza and the West Bank,
Ukraine, and elsewhere; funding to replenish U.S. weapon stockpiles;
assistance to regional partners in the Indo-Pacific; investments in
efforts to stop illegal fentanyl from coming into the U.S. and to
dismantle international drug cartels; and investment in U.S. Customs and
Border Protection to enhance border security and speed up migrant
processing.</p>

<p>I spent a lot of time and energy in my life worrying about things I
felt like I had to do for one reason or another. Either everyone else
was doing the thing, or specific people were pressuring me to do the
thing, or I never saw real examples or models of people who didn’t do
the thing, etc. At some point I started to realize that, if I really
challenged myself, I didn’t have to do some of the things I believed I
had to in order to win at life (and I would include the idea of having
to “win at life” on this list).</p>

<h2 id="cop-cant-go-on-like-this">COP Can’t Go On Like This</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcyODcxMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MTE1MzEyOX0.nwchmLDTGUPLLZNRj_T9g1CZnS2-afx-kGpj_Y6BMDY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It didn’t attract a lot of attention, but for a few months, it looked
like the United Nations climate process might break down.
</p>
<p>
There, process is substance: One of the most important acts every year
is the selection of the <em>next </em>country to run the Conference of
the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change, or COP. This distinction
<a href="https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">normally
rotates</a> among the UN’s five regional country groups; next year, a
country in the “Eastern Europe” group is due to host. All the members of
a group must unanimously agree on which country will get to host.
</p>
<p>
This is a highly contingent way to decide who gets to host a climate
conference. Really,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Regional_Groups" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
entire schema of UN regional groups</a> represents a hangover of Cold
War geopolitics that is now indefinitely unchangeable. (The “Western
Europe” group is essentially the early members of NATO; it includes such
notably non-western-European countries as Turkey, the United States, and
— hilariously — Australia.)
</p>
<p>
The “Eastern Europe” group, meanwhile, amounts to more or less the
former members of the Warsaw Pact. For obvious reasons, these countries
cannot agree on a consensus choice in 2023. Russia, the group’s largest
member, was not amenable to holding the COP in any eastern Europe NATO
member state, such as Poland, Latvia, or Finland. The eastern European
NATO members — as well as Ukraine, which is also in the UN regional
group — were similarly opposed to holding the COP in Russia.
</p>
<p>
That meant that attention focused on the group’s countries in the
Caucasus, at the edge of central Asia: Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia.
Yet difficulties presented themselves here too. Azerbaijan
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/27/world/europe/nagorno-karabakh-armenia-azerbaijan.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">successfully
seized an Armenian exclave</a> earlier this year,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/armenia-calls-un-mission-monitor-rights-nagorno-karabakh-2023-09-24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">evicting
up to 120,000 Armenians</a> as part of a campaign
<a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/ethnic-cleansing-happening-nagorno-karabakh-how-can-world-respond#:~:text=The%20ethnic%20Armenian%20population%20of,have%20fled%20west%20to%20Armenia." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">described
as ethnic cleansing</a>. Armenia blocked any Azeri bid to host the COP.
</p>
<p>
For the first time in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s
history, no country would have been able to lead COP the following year.
Geopolitics had seemingly broken the consensus mechanism that makes the
climate conference work.
</p>
<p>
This amounted to more than just a deficiency in party planning. It would
have forced Bonn, Germany — the home of the UNFCC’s permanent
headquarters — to host COP29, a kind of “break in case of emergency”
default option. And it would have allowed the United Arab Emirates, a
petrostate that has reportedly
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-67508331" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">used
the COP to make oil deals</a>, to retain the conference presidency for
at least another year.
</p>
<p>
That didn’t happen. Late last week, Armenia lifted its block of
Azerbaijan’s bid, and the two countries
<a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/azerbaijan-aremenia-good-will-steps-karabakh/32721137.html#:~:text=RL's%20Armenian%20Service-,Azerbaijan%2C%20Armenia%20Agree%20To%20Several%20Goodwill%20Steps,Including%20Mutual%20Release%20Of%20Prisoners&text=Azerbaijan%20released%2032%20Armenian%20servicemen,tangible%20steps%22%20toward%20building%20trust." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mutually
released prisoners</a> in a gesture of good will. (Their rapprochement
happened suspiciously close to President Vladimir Putin’s visit to the
U.A.E.) Next year’s COP will seemingly happen in Baku, the Azeri
capital.
</p>
<p>
But just because the COP process didn’t break doesn’t mean that it’s not
being stretched. All is not well with the COP. During this year’s
conference, a picture emerged of a COP being tested by a more rivalrous,
conflict-prone world. Geopolitics, the heightened importance of climate
change, and the sheer size of the conference have transformed the event
into something that it was never meant to be.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
This year, more than 100,000 people attended the COP. It was held at
Dubai’s opulent Expo City, the Disney World-style convention campus
<a href="https://www.bie-paris.org/site/en/all-world-expos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">initially
built for the 2020 World Expo</a>, the modern successor to World’s
Fairs. Hundreds of nonprofit groups and companies, as well as more than
190 countries, ran public pavilions that advertised their climate
accomplishments and views on decarbonization. Negotiators divided into
different blocs: China and the United States, oil-producing states and
small island nations, the West and the rest.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t always like this. When the first COP was held in Berlin in
1995, the world was in a very different era, Lee Beck, the senior
director for Europe and the Middle East at the Clean Air Task Force,
told me. It was “the peak of multilateralism, followed by relative
geopolitical stability and peace,” she said. The United States and the
broader West set the agenda for global events.
</p>
<p>
“In the last two years — others would say the writing was on the wall as
early as 2014 — geopolitical fragmentation really is visible,” she said.
“You’re really pushing the limits of multilateralism at this one. One of
the cracks is we’re unable to agree where the COP even will be.”
</p>
<p>
But geopolitics are not the only force stretching COP to the limit.
Another is the sheer size of the event itself.
</p>
<p>
There used to be “big COPs” and “small COPs”: COP21, the 2015 meeting
where the Paris Agreement was finalized, was a “big COP,” but the
following year’s conference in Marrakech, Morocco, was a fairly minor
one. Even COP21 was less than half the size of this year’s COP. And in
one possible read, this year <em>should</em> have been a smaller COP —
the biggest to-dos were
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-loss-damage-reparations-fund" target="_self">formally
launching the Loss and Damage fund</a> and writing
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-draft" target="_self">the
Global Stocktake report</a>, a kind of report card on the world’s
climate progress (or lack thereof).
</p>
<p>
But small COPs don’t seem to happen any more. Since the pandemic ended
and COP26
<a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/cop26" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took
place in Glasgow, Scotland</a>, COPs have swollen in size, creating the
age of the new “mega-COP.” More than 100,000 people attended the
conference this year, making it by far the biggest COP ever. It was more
than twice the size of last year’s confab in Sharm al-Sheikh, Egypt,
which was previously the biggest COP ever. Most of those attendees
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/11/climate/cop28-dubai.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">had
nothing to do</a> with the negotiations ostensibly at the center of the
conference — they were investors, technologists, scholars, scientists,
or experts — and instead made up a de facto global trade show on climate
solutions.
</p>
<p>
COP is now so big and climate is now so important that even the lack of
news about the conference can generate news. When President Joe Biden
declined to attend this year’s conference, <em>The New York Times
</em>push-alerted it.
</p>
<p>
But there are possibilities that could improve the situation. One of
them might be that COP simply becomes so unmanageable that it has to
scale back. Few cities have the spare capacity to house an extra 100,000
visitors for 12 days. New York City, for instance, only has
<a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/01/15/what-happens-to-all-of-nyc-s-empty-hotels-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about
123,000 hotel rooms</a> total. If COP were to keep growing, the problem
would only get harder. When 150,000
people<a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Dreamforce-hits-downtown-S-F-with-150-000-people-6504242.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
descended on San Francisco</a> for Salesforce’s annual conference in
2015, the company docked a cruise ship in the bay to provide an extra
thousand rooms.
</p>
<p>
There are solutions, Beck said. She noted this was the first year that
every continent had held its own Climate Week: a smaller event focusing
on more region-specific decarbonization challenges. This COP has also
seen the emergence of country coalitions that rally around different
issues or approaches. The set of countries that backed a pledge to
triple renewable capacity, for instance, is different from the smaller
coalition that wanted to triple nuclear capacity. These smaller, more
sector-specific coalitions may have more ability to actually decarbonize
and address climate change, she said.
</p>
<p>
For all these challenges, perhaps the biggest miracle is that the UNFCC
process works at all, Eve Tamme, a former climate negotiator for the
European Commission, told me.
</p>
<p>
“The UNFCCC process is based on consensus between almost 200 countries.
Judging based on the complexity of the issue at hand and the divergence
of views among the countries, it seems impossible that such a process
could deliver anything at all,” she said. Even when you follow the
negotiations closely, it may seem like there’s barely any movement at
all, she said.
</p>
<p>
“But then again, we got the Kyoto Protocol,” she said. “And we got the
Paris Agreement. So while it may look broken in the short term, somehow
this dysfunctional process can still deliver.”

Survivors Mark Hanukkah Amid Worries of Israel-Hamas War,
Antisemitism</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Berlin — Holocaust survivors from around the globe will mark the
start of the fifth day of Hanukkah together with a virtual ceremony as
Jews worldwide worry about the Israel-Hamas war and a spike of
antisemitism in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Survivors can join an online ceremony of a menorah lighting Monday
night to pay tribute to the 6 million European Jews killed by the Nazis
in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Several dozen survivors were also expected to gather in-person for a
menorah lighting at Jerusalem’s Western Wall — the holiest place where
Jews can pray.</p>
<p>“Holocaust survivors somehow overcame the depravity of concentration
camps, death camps and killing centers, among other horrors, to become
our living exemplars, providing a roadmap on how light can overcome
darkness,” Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the
Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, said in remarks
released to The Associated Press ahead of the ceremony.</p>
<p>The New York-based conference is organizing the event in observance
of International Holocaust Survivors Night.</p>
<p>“Their resilience, their strength and their fortitude leave a truly
indelible light in this world,” Schneider added.</p>
<p>Hanukkah, also known as Judaism’s festival of lights, marks the
rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century B.C., after a
small group of Jewish fighters known as the Maccabees liberated it from
occupying Syrian forces.</p>
<p>This year’s holiday comes as many Jews feel traumatized by Hamas’
deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and in which the
militants took some 240 as hostages. Israel responded with a bombing
campaign and a ground offensive that has so far killed more than 18,000
people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory’s Health Ministry.
The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant
deaths.</p>
<p>Several celebrities and world leaders spoke about the attack in
messages that were to be shown at the ceremony. German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz said “Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel has affected us all
deeply. Something of abyssal evil broke free that day,” according to
comments released to the AP.</p>
<p>“The perpetrators’ motive is clear: They wanted to hit Israel,” the
chancellor added. “They wanted to murder Jews. In its repugnant
brutality and abhorrence, however, the terror is also directed against
humanity itself.”</p>
<p>Scholz, addressing Holocaust survivors, said he tries “to imagine how
much the images from Israel, how much antisemitic hatred on the internet
and on the streets around the world must be hitting you, of all people
right in the heart.”</p>
<p>“This … pains me a lot,” he said.</p>
<p>The virtual event, which starts at 8 p.m. Monday in Germany, will
also include musical performances, celebrity guests and messages from
Holocaust survivors from around the globe.</p>
<p>Leon Weintraub, a Holocaust survivor from Sweden, who was in Israel
during the Hamas attack, recounted what he experienced that day.</p>
<p>“On Oct. 7, I woke up from the sirens in the center of Tel Aviv. All
at once I was again in September 1939 when the Nazis invaded Poland,” he
said. “A terrible feeling, a shiver, a feeling of dread to be again in a
war.”</p>
<p>“We celebrate Chanukah now, the festival of lights. I hope that the
light will also bring the people enlightenment,” Weintraub added. “That
people will rethink and look at us people of Jewish descent as normal,
equal. Human beings.”</p>
<p>American comedian Billy Crystal, actress Jamie Lee Curtis and actor
Jason Alexander will also speak at the event, and there will also be a
by a musical performance from Grammy and Tony Award-winning singer Barry
Manilow, as well as the cast of Harmony.</p>

<p>Today, Apple pushed out the public releases of iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2,
macOS Sonoma 14.2, watchOS 10.2, and tvOS 17.2. iOS 17.2 and iPadOS
17.2’s flagship feature is the new Journal app, which Apple teased when
it first introduced iOS 17 earlier. The app mimics several existing
popular journaling apps in the App Store from third-party developers but
leverages data from your Photos, workouts, and other Apple apps to make
journaling suggestions. Other features include the ability to tap a
“catch-up arrow” to scroll to the first missed message in a conversation
in Messages, the ability to take spatial video photos for later viewing
on Vision Pro, and several tweaks and additions to the Weather app. ↫

<h2 id="bots-again">Bots, again</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Bots, again
</h1>
<p>
I come home from a friendly meetup and notice that my tiny web-server
has a load of 80 instead of the usual 0.5. What the hell is going on? I
look at the logs of the last 24 hours and see an IP number with more
than 100 000 hits in the last 24h. What are they doing?
</p>
<p>
Whois tells me it is from the “Alibaba Cloud”. Oh yeah? What are the
Chinese trying to do on my site?
</p>
<p>
I start poking around. More and more IP numbers from all over the net
show up. Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud.
</p>
<p>
All right, so I’m blocking some of them individually as I go, but after
a while I realize that I probably have to block them at the network
level.
</p>
<p>
For the moment I’m also taking down one of the wikis that’s overloading
my server.
</p>
<p>
Just looking at the top 10 offenders for two of my domains, and running
whois on them to find the entire network they belong to, and checking
that it’s Alibaba or Tencent:
</p>
<pre><code># Alibaba Cloud 2023-12-10
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.76.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.80.0.0/13'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.74.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.235.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.246.0.0/16'&quot; [or]

RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.240.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.236.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
# Tencent Cloud
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '42.192.0.0/15'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '49.232.0.0/14'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '101.34.0.0/15'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '43.142.0.0/16'&quot; [or]
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '124.220.0.0/14'&quot;
RewriteRule ^ https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
If I want this to be for the entire server and not repeat it for each
location, I guess I’ll have to use Apache rewrite rules.
</p>
<p>
While I’m doing this, I notice a new pattern… My wiki software allows
you to fetch a feed for every page. Either it contains updates to the
page (Oddmuse), or a feed of the pages linked (Oddmu). It’s for humans.
</p>
<p>
Of course some shit engineer decided that it was a good idea to scan the
web for all the feeds that are out there (so rare! so precious!) and to
download them all, forever (uncover the darknet! server our customers!)
and now I have to block IP number ranges, add robot agents to robots.txt
files (not all of them provide one), or block user agents (not all of
them provide a useful one) and I block and block and block (for the
environment! to avoid +2.0°C and the end of human civilization!) and all
this while I know that all these shit requests exist out there, for all
the sites, everywhere – a hundred thousand requests or more per day, per
site, wasting CO₂ – and what am I going to do, kill the feeds for humans
because some shit engineer decided to feed a machine?
</p>
<p>
I’m on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)#The_Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian
Jihad</a> again.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and Virgin Media is downloading tons of PDFs I’m hosting? Are they
looking for copyright violations? On the blocklist they go.
</p>
<p>
And what’s this, Feedly is also downloading feeds like crazy, every few
minutes? Slow down, idiots. My news is not important. On the blocklist
they go. Or are you trying to train your stupid intelligence? Fuck this
AI training stuff. I already use “X-Robots-Tag: noimageai” but I guess I
should add even more HTTP headers to block even more engineers
overstepping boundaries?
</p>
<p>
Ah, and MonitoRSS going into overdrive, from the Amazon Cloud. Really, I
don’t think there are humans in the Amazon Cloud. Onto the blocklist
they go. Well, at least this IP range.
</p>
<p>
And who’s that VelenPublicWebCrawler, zealously collecting pages? Onto
the blocklists they go.

It is difficult to believe that several states continue to impose the
same inhuman and unconstitutional conditions today, rather than the
excellent practices of the Juvenile Court, Probation Department, and
private treatment programs here.

RISC-V ready for HPC prime-time: evaluating the 64-core Sophon SG2042
RISC-V CPU</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Sophon SG2042 is the world’s first commodity 64-core RISC-V CPU
for high performance workloads and an important question is whether the
SG2042 has the potential to encourage the HPC community to embrace
RISC-V. In this paper we undertaking a performance exploration of the
SG2042 against existing RISC-V hardware and high performance x86 CPUs in
use by modern supercomputers. Leveraging the RAJAPerf benchmarking
suite, we discover that on average, the SG2042 delivers, per core,
between five and ten times the performance compared to the nearest
widely available RISC-V hardware. We found that, on average, the x86
high performance CPUs under test outperform the SG2042 by between four
and eight times for multi-threaded workloads, although some individual
kernels do perform faster on the SG2042. The result of this work is a
performance study that not only contrasts this new RISC-V CPU against
existing technologies, but furthermore shares performance best practice.
↫ Nick Brown, Maurice Jamieson, Joseph Lee, Paul Wang The Sophon SG2042
is the RISC-V processor found in the Milk-V Pioneer workstation, which
was recently featured on LTT as well, for the video crowd among us.
There’s definitely still a way to go for RISC-V, but the gains over the
past few years are clear, and if this keeps progressing this way, it
won’t be long before RISC-V becomes a valid, competitive
architecture.</p>

<h2 id="dubai-is-a-crappy-place-to-have-a-climate-protest">Dubai Is a
Crappy Place to Have a Climate Protest</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc0Mjc3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNzAwODY3OH0.l4RPyq9Z-ZWKT3HVqx6bm1xPqHVYnJa6LdGmzAJfjMg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Political protests are a staple of COP summits. Thousands of climate
activists descend on the event each year to call for stronger global
commitments to building renewables and quitting fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
But at COP28, United Arab Emirates laws restricting speech and banning
most forms of public protest have constrained where and how people can
speak out. Demonstrations are only permitted in areas managed by the UN,
known as the “blue zone,” and have to be approved before they can take
place.
</p>
<p>
“We have to say how loud we’re going to be, what’s going to be written
on the banners. We’re not allowed to name countries and corporations. So
it’s really a very sanitized space,” Lise Masson, an organizer at
Friends of the Earth International,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/cop28-climate-youth-activists-restrictions-dubai-91fe6d8a712af484b56336cf9b3f8988" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
the <em>Associated Press</em></a> last week.
</p>
<p>
Pre-approved rallies went on throughout last week. But as negotiations
intensified over the weekend, the demonstrations did, too. Activists
declared Saturday a day of protest, the <em>AP</em> said. A group of
about 25 people called for the release of pro-democracy prisoners staged
what
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/activists-stage-rare-uae-politics-protest-during-cop28-climate-summit-2023-12-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em>
called</a> a “very rare” UAE protest, while 500 people urged a ceasefire
in Gaza. That’s not to say those demonstrations were unrestrained,
however. Pro-democracy protesters were not allowed to display detainees’
names, and ceasefire demonstrators were barred from naming Israel or
Hamas.
</p>
<p>
Also on Saturday, a small number of climate activists staged a brief
sit-in at OPEC’s pavilion after the oil cartel allegedly directed its
members to reject any agreement involving phasing out fossil fuels,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/climate/opec-cop28-climate-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
New York Times</em> reported</a>. And as anger simmered over Monday’s
watered-down global stocktake draft — which
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-fossil-fuel-phaseout" target="_self">does
not mention</a> a fossil fuel phase-out — climate activists continued to
chafe against the restrictions on their ability to protest during the
summit’s final hours.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the draft release, a line of silent activists held signs
pushing countries to “hold the line” on the phaseout. One protester,
however, refused to follow the pre-approved plan. Licypriya Kangujam, a
12-year-old climate activist from India, ran onto the stage after the
“hold the line” protest on Monday, shouting and brandishing a sign that
read, “End fossil fuel. Save our planet and our future.” Kangujam was
detained and eventually removed from the summit, according to

id="discipline-handed-down-for-us-intelligence-discord-leaks">Discipline
Handed Down for US Intelligence ‘Discord Leaks’</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Pentagon — The U.S. Air Force took disciplinary action against 15
airmen, charging that a lack of supervision and a failure to take action
contributed to the so-called ‘Discord intelligence leaks’ that rattled
the U.S. intelligence community.</p>
<p>A 21-year-old Air National Guardsman, Jack Teixeira, was arrested
this past April, shortly after the leaks were discovered, and is facing
multiple charges for removing documents from a secured work environment,
and then posting the information or photos for a small group on Discord,
a social media platform popular with gamers.</p>
<p>At the time, a top Pentagon official said the leaks, which revealed
information about Russia’s war in Ukraine and about U.S. allies, posed
“a very serious risk” to national security.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, the Air Force said the commander of Teixeira’s
Air National Guard unit, the 102nd Intelligence Wing, was relieved of
command.</p>
<p>Another 14 individuals where subjected to non-judicial punishment
under the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
<p>The Air Force defended the actions, saying officials in Teixeira’s
unit could have and should have taken action that could have mitigated
the improper disclosure of intelligence.</p>
<p>“Individuals in Teixeira’s unit failed to take proper action after
becoming aware of his intelligence-seeking activities,’ the Air Force
said, citing a report by its inspector general.</p>
<p>“Leadership was not vigilant in inspecting the conduct of all persons
who were placed under their command,” the Air Force said.</p>
<p>The statement also said the intelligence leaks were further enabled
by “inconsistent guidance for reporting security incidents” and
“ineffective processes for administering disciplinary actions.”</p>
<p>“However, the investigation did not find evidence that members of
Teixeira’s supervisory chain were aware of his alleged unauthorized
disclosures,” the Air Force said.</p>
<p>According to the Air Force inspector general, evidence indicated that
members of the 102nd Intelligence Wing had information on at least four
incidents involving questionable activity by Teixeira, and that a
smaller number of individuals “had a more complete picture” of
Teixeira’s activities but “failed to report the full details of these
security concerns/incidents.”</p>
<p>“Had any of these members come forward, security officials would
likely have facilitated restricting systems/facility access and alerted
the appropriate authorities, reducing the length and depth of the
unauthorized and unlawful disclosures by several months,” the report
said.</p>
<p>The inspector general’s report further found that a routine
background check flagged concerns about Teixeira, but that the military
granted him top secret clearance anyway.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report found those concerns were never shared with
Teixeira’s unit.</p>
<p>“The details learned in background checks are not routinely shared
with a member’s unit,” it said.  “Had the unit been made aware of
potential security concerns identified during the clearance adjudication
process, they may have acted more quickly.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon Monday said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been made
aware of the Air Force’s findings and actions, adding Austin is
confident officials are “taking the necessary steps.”</p>
<p>This past July, the Pentagon released the results of its own review
into the leaks, calling for a tightening of existing security measures. 
But it rejected the need for any sweeping overhaul.</p>
<p>“There was no single point of failure,” a senior defense official
said at the time, speaking to reporters about the review’s findings on
the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“What we see here is we have a growing ecosystem of classified
facilities and a body of personnel who are cleared,” the official said.
“Within that we have opportunities to clarify policy … they are not the
clearest documents always.”</p>
<p>Still, Defense Department officials have taken steps to reduce the
number of people with access to classified information.</p>
<p>According to a 2017 report by the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence, approximately 4 million people have U.S. security
clearances, with 1.3 million cleared to access top secret

Not Just You — High Interest Rates Are Hurting the Planet, Too</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
New clean energy projects have a lot going for them. For one, building
them has gotten extremely cheap. At the same time, because the wind
blowing and the sun shining are unlimited free resources, operating
costs for a clean energy power plant are also pretty low. That’s the
beauty of a clean energy economy — it reduces our exposure to the price
swings, recessions, political instability, and
<a href="https://www.dezernatzukunft.org/en/fossil-fuel-to-the-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surging
inflation</a> that come with fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that the cure for surging inflation — hiking up interest
rates — is having a big, bad impact on clean energy. Elevated interest
rates directly and disproportionately
<a href="https://medium.com/iipp-blog/can-we-avoid-green-collateral-damage-from-rising-interest-rates-1259ea94c9ea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raise
costs</a> for clean power projects, throwing a handbrake on the clean
energy transition and its deflationary impacts exactly when we need them
most.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how it happens: Nearly all the costs of clean energy projects are
upfront capital expenditures to cover things like building wind turbines
and installing solar panels. And as anyone with a mortgage or car loan
can tell you, the higher the amount you need to finance up front, the
more you care about your interest rate.
</p>
<p>
By comparison, a fossil fuel power plant will pay as they go for the
fuel they need to operate, meaning they have less to finance. And
there’s the rub — those extra financing costs get passed on to clean
energy consumers. Even if a fossil fuel power plant and a clean energy
power plant have equivalent associated costs, if one has to finance more
of that cost upfront at higher and higher interest rates, it’s going to
be less competitive.
<a href="https://medium.com/iipp-blog/can-we-avoid-green-collateral-damage-from-rising-interest-rates-1259ea94c9ea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Estimates
suggest</a> that as interest rates rise, the total cost of energy from a
gas power plant might rise 8%, but for a clean energy project the same
cost could rise as much as 47%.
</p>
<p>
That impact is being felt across the developed world — Bloomberg’s clean
energy research division, BNEF, estimates that 60% of the cost increase
for offshore wind is the direct result of rising interest rates — but
the impact in the developing world is even more insidious. In emerging
markets, the financing cost to deploy the exact same technology can be
as much as
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/14/climate-focused-reform-world-bank-could-be-done-year-al-gore#:~:text=Gore%20gave%20an%20example%3A%20%E2%80%9CIf,higher%20than%20for%20OECD%20countries." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven
times higher</a>. That’s a big part of the reasoning behind the
International Energy Agency’s estimate that we’ll have a
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/scaling-up-private-finance-for-clean-energy-in-emerging-and-developing-economies/executive-summary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2
trillion clean finance gap in emerging and developing economies</a> by
2030.
</p>
<p>
In one respect, however, we are in luck — financial regulators have a
wide variety of tools they could deploy to solve this problem by
creating lower, dual rates for clean energy.
</p>
<p>
One way to do that is to create dedicated central bank programs that
give banks access to cheap credit if they pass it on to sectors of the
economy that align with key industrial policy goals — like, say, solving
climate change. If this kind of facility existed, your local bank could
decide that because you put solar panels on your roof, bought an
electric car, or installed a heat pump, it could offer you a mortgage at
4% instead of today’s 7% rate. Or it could finance an offshore wind
developer’s first projects at below-market rates, helping to make them
competitive in a challenging economic environment.
</p>
<p>
As we all know, however, creating new programs or passing new policies
is hard. Instead, we might want to just make existing lending programs
greener. In the EU, for example,
<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp231122~e12db02da3.en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leaders
at the European Central Bank</a> are considering using existing programs
to
<a href="https://greencentralbanking.com/research/targeting-a-sustainable-recovery-with-green-tltros/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provide
banks with financing</a> at favorable rates if they use it to support
clean energy.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, here in the U.S., the Fed could reduce
<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/fed-targeted-lending-to-fight-climate-change-by-megan-greene-1-2021-04?barrier=accesspaylog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discount
window</a> interest rates and adjust
<a href="https://ballsandstrikes.org/legal-culture/supreme-court-climate-here-come-the-fed-baby/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collateral
policies</a> to incentivize clean energy lending — in other words, it
could set the terms on which banks borrow from the Fed to support green
loans and discourage dirty loans. Intervening this way would incentivize
banks to lend more to clean energy at lower rates.
</p>
<p>
The Fed could also use its emergency powers to create a new program just
to provide clean energy with cheaper capital because of the adverse
impacts of high interest rates. It recently used these powers to create
the Bank Term Funding Program explicitly to mitigate the impact of
higher rates on banks; in “unusual and exigent circumstances” and with
the Department of the Treasury’s approval, it could adopt a new program
to provide similar direct support for clean energy. A
once-in-a-civilization clean energy transition to head off a climate
crisis, underwritten by historic climate legislation whose impact is now
threatened by rising interest rates, would seem to qualify.
</p>
<p>
But wait, there’s more! The Fed, along with its fellow banking
regulators the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, could leverage the new Community
Reinvestment Act regulations to encourage certain clean energy
investments,
<a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2023/nr-ia-2023-117a.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including</a>
community solar and “microgrid and battery” projects that could help
smooth out power supply to public housing in extreme weather.
</p>
<p>
And of course, it’s not just central banks that can create lower dual
rates for clean energy. Public finance institutions can also play an
instrumental role by using their own lower cost of finance to bring down
the cost of credit. For instance, the EU is providing
<a href="https://twitter.com/WindEurope/status/1716793384273121498" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial
support for the wind industry</a> in the form of loan guarantees from
the European Investment Bank. Loan guarantees work by putting the full
credit of the government behind a particular project, thereby giving
lenders more confidence they won’t lose their money, which brings down
the cost of finance.
</p>
<p>
In the U.S.,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding" target="_self">subsidized
loans</a> and guarantees funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and
administered by the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office are
already helping to create dual rates for offshore wind — which, thanks
to new Treasury guidance, can now be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/offshore-wind-investment-tax-credit-biden" target="_self">extended
to cover associated infrastructure</a> like sub-sea cables. Still,
that’s nowhere near what the Fed could do. Add in the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding" target="_blank">new
green bank</a> capitalized with funding from the IRA that could extend
low-interest loans for everything from electric vehicles to heat pumps
and we’ve got a bevy of tools at our disposal.
</p>
<p>
For those wondering whether this kind of Fed policy could be co-opted to
support everything from defense manufacturing to fossil fuel production,
the answer is that industries always lobby for favorable policy wherever
they can get them. But dual interest rates and targeted lending programs
are common practice around the world, even in free market economies,
with no such terrible consequences. At the end of the day, policy is
just a tool, and it’s up to us to make sure it is used to achieve
society’s goals, not corporate profits.
</p>
<p>
Concern over the impact of rising interest rates on clean energy and the
economy more broadly is hitting a crescendo, and for good reason. This
week the Fed governors will meet to decide whether further rate
increases are still warranted. Most Fed-watchers think this
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-11-21/the-fed-rate-hiking-cycle-is-over-macropolicy-s-hunter-video" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cycle
of rising interest rates is finally over</a>, but there’s no such thing
as a guarantee.
</p>
<p>
More importantly, even if the Fed says “enough,” the reality is that our
currently elevated rates will almost certainly take years to come down.
Meanwhile, we have a rapidly vanishing window of time to reach peak
emissions to stay under the Paris Agreement’s limit of 1.5 degrees
Celsius of temperature rise. That means we need new targeted policy
interventions that bring down the cost of finance to keep the clean
energy transition humming. Unlike climate change, the impact of high
interest rates on clean energy is not a force of nature. It’s one we can
control.

‘Phase-Out’ Is Officially Out</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc0MjQzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MjYwNzc2NH0.rII6t916eHwF56ujOtATA2md0RM8LsBK0IISYE6g7X0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
One of the most exciting and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-fossil-fuels-phaseout" target="_self">contentious</a>
questions looming over the COP28 climate summit in Dubai this year has
been whether countries will agree to an historic phase out of fossil
fuels to stave off the worst effects of climate change. With one day
left on the official conference agenda, we may have our answer: No.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/GST_2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A
new draft of the global stocktake</a> text dropped Monday and it
contains no mention of a fossil fuel phase out or phase down. Instead,
the relevant section of the text now calls for “reducing both
consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and
equitable manner so as to achieve net zero by, before, or around 2050 in
keeping with the science.”
</p>
<p>
That the phase-out language didn’t survive a tense weekend of
negotiations isn’t a huge surprise. Any deal to emerge from the annual
United Nations climate summit must be unanimously supported by all 198
participating nations. Saudi Arabia
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/climate/saudi-arabia-cop28-fossil-fuels.html%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">staunchly
opposed</a> a phase-out, while a handful of powerful oil-producing
countries (including the U.S.) wanted to see specific caveats and
provisions.
</p>
<p>
Strong language on moving past oil and gas was always a long shot, but
some activists and governments are still disappointed. Fossil fuels are
a primary source of planet-warming pollution, which must fall by at
least 45% “to avoid global catastrophe,”
<a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> the UN. New analysis from the International Energy Agency
<a href="https://www.iea.org/news/iea-assessment-of-the-evolving-pledges-at-cop28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concluded</a>
that the voluntary emissions pledges to come out of COP28 so far are
nowhere near dramatic enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius
above pre-industrial levels.
</p>
<p>
“This draft takes a giant step backwards,”
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2023/dec/11/cop28-live-time-to-be-ambitious-says-president-as-summit-enters-final-days?page=with:block-657716738f087d36df057e62#block-657716738f087d36df057e62" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
Teresa Anderson, Global Climate Lead at ActionAid. “It’s staggeringly
empty of any new commitments.” <em>CarbonBrief’</em>s Simon Evans
<a href="https://twitter.com/DrSimEvans/status/1734216992012247456" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laments</a>
that “hardly any of the verbs in the latest draft global stocktake text
actually ask for action.” Kaisa Kosonen, head of the Greenpeace COP28
delegation,
<a href="https://twitter.com/CANIntl/status/1734217319021154428" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls
it “a dog’s dinner.”</a>
</p>
<p>
The new text isn’t entirely toothless, though. “By requiring countries
to reduce their fossil fuel production, it effectively achieves the same
ends as a phase down, without using the contentious language that some
countries would not allow,”
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2023/dec/11/cop28-live-time-to-be-ambitious-says-president-as-summit-enters-final-days#top-of-blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a>
<em>The Guardian</em>’s Fiona Harvey. Past language focusing on fossil
fuel emissions instead of production was considered a sneaky workaround
for countries that want to keep emitting while relying on carbon capture
and storage. So focusing specifically on production could be interpreted
as an attempt at stronger accountability.
</p>
<p>
“It appears to be a compromise between Saudi Arabia who didn’t want any
mention of fossils and the progressive countries who called for an
outright fossil fuel phase out,”
<a href="https://twitter.com/James_BG/status/1734216777574334635/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa. “It’s in the middle and
uses creative language to describe the direction of travel.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not sufficient,”
<a href="https://twitter.com/James_BG/status/1734204281996091880" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conceded</a>
<em>BusinessGreen</em>’s James Murray. “But the signal to investors and
businesses is pretty clear. Is it enough to secure backing from COP’s
opposing factions?”

id="jury-selection-begins-in-election-workers-defamation-damages-trial-against-rudy-giuliani">Jury
Selection Begins in Election Workers’ Defamation Damages Trial Against
Rudy Giuliani</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON —  Jury selection got underway on Monday in the federal
case that will determine how how much Rudy Giuliani might have to pay
two Georgia election workers he falsely accused of fraud while pushing
Donald Trump’s baseless claims after the 2020 election.</p>
<p>The former New York City mayor has already been found liable in the
defamation lawsuit brought by Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea
“Shaye” Moss, who endured threats and harassment after they became the
target of a conspiracy theory spread by Trump and his allies. The only
issue to be determined at the trial is the amount of damages, if any,
Giuliani must pay.</p>
<p>Giuliani did not speak to reporters as he entered Washington’s
federal courthouse — the same building where Trump is set to stand trial
in March on criminal charges accusing the former president of scheming
to overturn his loss to President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The defamation case is among many legal and financial woes mounting
for Giuliani, who was celebrated as “America’s mayor” in the aftermath
of the 9/11 terrorist attack and became one of the most ardent promoters
of Trump’s election lies.</p>
<p>Giuliani is also criminally charged alongside Trump and others in the
Georgia case accusing them of trying to illegally overturn the results
of the election in the state. Giuliani has pleaded not guilty and
maintains he had every right to raise questions about what he believed
to be election fraud.</p>
<p>He was sued in September by a former lawyer who alleged Giuliani only
paid a fraction of roughly $1.6 million in legal fees stemming from
investigations into his efforts to keep Trump in the White House. And
the judge overseeing the election workers’ lawsuit has already ordered
Giuliani and his business entities to pay tens of thousands of dollars
in attorneys’ fees.</p>
<p>Overseeing the defamation case is District Judge Beryl Howell, who is
well-versed in handling matters related to Trump, having served as chief
judge of Washington’s federal court for the entirety of Trump’s
presidency.</p>
<p>In that role, the appointee of former President Barack Obama has made
several significant rulings, including determining in 2020 that the
House of Representatives was entitled to secret grand jury testimony
from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and, more recently,
issuing a sealed opinion requiring a lawyer for Trump to testify before
the grand jury over his objections in an investigation into the
mishandling of classified documents.</p>
<p>Moss had worked for the Fulton County elections department since 2012
and supervised the absentee ballot operation during the 2020 election.
Freeman was a temporary election worker, verifying signatures on
absentee ballots and preparing them to be counted and processed.</p>
<p>Giuliani and other Trump allies seized on surveillance footage to
push a conspiracy theory that the election workers pulled fraudulent
ballots out of suitcases. The claims were quickly debunked by Georgia
election officials, who found no improper counting of ballots.</p>
<p>The women have said the false claims led to a barrage of violent
threats and harassment that at one point led Freeman to leave her home
for more than two months. In emotional testimony before the U.S. House
Committee that investigated the U.S. Capitol attack, Moss recounted
receiving an onslaught of threatening and racist messages.</p>
<p>In an August decision holding Giuliani liable in the case, Howell
said the Trump adviser gave “only lip service” to complying with his
legal obligations and had failed to turn over information requested by
the mother and daughter. The judge in October said that Giuliani had
flagrantly disregarded an order to provide documents concerning his
personal and business assets. She said that jurors deciding the amount
of damages would be told they must infer that Giuliani was intentionally
trying to hide financial documents in the hopes of “artificially
deflating his net worth.”</p>
<p>Giuliani conceded in July that he made public comments falsely
claiming Freeman and Moss committed fraud while counting ballots at
State Farm Arena in Atlanta. But Giuliani argued that the statements
were protected by the First Amendment.</p>

It is labelled as

</p>
<p>
Right now my fingers are confused and seemed to expect the Atreus layout
I had been using recently, at least as far as the thumbs go.
</p>
<p>
I get the feeling that not all keys work as intended, though. The right
Ctrl key <del>has no effect</del> is a layer switch that enables &lt;
and &gt; to control the volume, for example. The left Alt key is GUI.
The right Alt key <del>has no effect</del> had a bent pin on their
switch. The App key <del>has no effect</del> had a bent pin on their
switch. The App key is actually Alt. The ] and = keys <del>have no
effect</del> had a bent pin on their switches. The Volume Up key is
mapped to Delete. The Volume Down key is mapped to Prior. The Mute Key
is mapped to Next.
</p>
<p>
Hm.

As it turns out, the problem was the firmware. My guess is that it was

Daddy-Daughter Podcast 2023 (11 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Daddy-Daughter Podcast 2023: From age 4 to age 15. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008,
2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Daddy-Daughter
Podcast 2023 (permalink) 11 years ago, my kid’s daycare surprised us by
announcing that they were closing for Christmas break a day before
everyone else, so I ended up with our then-four-year-old daughter,
Poesy, at my office for the day. After she got bored with coloring and
playing with my office toys, I sat her down on my lap in front of my
podcast mic and we recorded the greatest, all-singing episode of my
podcast ever: https://craphound.com/news/2012/12/21/happy-hols/ Thus
began an annual tradition. Every year since – save one, when my mic was
busted – we have recorded a podcast: I interview the kid about her
favorite media, apps, books, and hobbies. Sometimes, she gives a
tutorial. Then, we sing a song. She’s 15 now (!), and I still managed to
drag her to the mic this weekend. We discussed her musical favorites,
old (Ike and Tina singing “Proud Mary”) and new (Dominic Fyke). We
discuss high school, volunteering at the zoo, and the rigors of dance
team. She teaches us how to drive. She runs down her favorite apps, and
discusses her recent name change. And then, we sing!
https://craphound.com/news/2023/12/10/daddy-daughter-podcast-2023-edition/
This is the eleventh installment in this time-series snapshots of my
kid, starting in London, then moving to LA, and every year I go back and
listen to the previous recordings. It’s not just a wonderful moment of
nostalgia for me – it’s also a powerful way to put everything into
perspective. Anyone who’s kept a journal (or a blog!) knows, the act of
regular record-keeping, combined with regular revisiting of those
records, turns the impressionistic jumble of memory into a clear picture
of your life and its trajectory. We remember so poorly, but our
treacherous minds fill in those omissions with whatever’s going on right
now, so if times are good now, we remember all times as good. If times
are bad, everything seems bad. The following year sees Poesy far more
confident and even funnier – and excited about working at the zoo
someday:
https://craphound.com/news/2013/12/23/christmastime-daddy-daughter-podcast-with-poesy/
At six, Poesy has learned a little French, and some naughty words for
Jingle Bells (and she’s got a lot more vocal control!):
https://craphound.com/news/2014/12/22/podcast-happy-xmas-guest-starring-poesy/
At seven, Poesy is living in Los Angeles and my mic is very busted, but
Poesy knows all the words to Frosty and she’s got the barrelhouse
walkout nailed:
https://craphound.com/news/2015/12/25/podcast-happy-xmas-guest-starring-poesy-2/
We didn’t manage to record the next year, so we catch up with Poesy at
nine, with her English accent all but gone – but her memory for lyrics
is better than ever (who knew there were so many choruses to “Deck the
Halls?”). This is the first time I interviewed her, for an in-depth
discussion of how to make slime (remember slime?):
https://craphound.com/news/2017/12/23/reviving-my-christmas-daddy-daughter-podcast-with-poesy/
At ten, Poesy is now watching online makeup tutorials and has lots of
advice for you, and is super into squishies:
https://craphound.com/news/2018/12/24/christmas-podcast-with-poesy-2018-edition/
At eleven, Poesy’s no longer willing to sing, but she has lots of
information about riding horses. This is the first year that she’s got
her own music preferences, with half of them being contemporary artists
like Billie Eilish and the other half being older acts like Queen. This
is also the year that she got rid of all her old toys, books and
clothes, because they were “not her style”:
https://craphound.com/podcast/2019/12/20/my-annual-daddy-daughter-xmas-podcast-interview-with-an-11-year-old/
Twelve sees us podcasting from covid lockdown. No song this year, but
she’s playing video games (Among Us), thrifting (while double-masked),
and she’s just discovered Tiktok, along with Tiktok dances, and she’s
started to find cool music that I enjoy:
https://craphound.com/news/2020/12/11/daddy-daughter-podcast-2020-edition/
At thirteen, Poe’s a high school freshman and the singing is back! She’s
big into Drag Race and Ru Paul. And high school sucks so hard that she’d
rather go back to Zoom school. She’s still riding horses, and she’s
fallen in love with a book for the first time in years: Animal Farm (but
she hates the ending):
https://craphound.com/news/2021/12/23/daddy-daughter-podcast-2021-edition/
Last year, Poesy was fourteen, and my office had just flooded out in a
freak rainstorm. Poesy has discovered her argumentative nature, and she
loves hiking in nearby Angeles National Forest. She’s getting into
hiphop – Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Cyprus Hill – and South Park (also
Fleetwood Mac!). We get a lot about Big Mouth, and a long discussion of
her short fiction writing:
https://craphound.com/podcast/2022/12/12/daddy-daughter-podcast-2022-edition/
These annual time-capsules are just tremendous. I may not have had the
discipline to do daily, time-lapse ready photo portraits, but this
corny, silly yearly tradition is more than a way for my kid and me to
spend a few minutes together just before Christmas – they’re a way to
connect to our past and think about the future to come. I can imagine
doing these over Zoom when the kid’s away at university in a couple
years, though who knows if she’ll stand for that. Here’s the podcast
episode:

Children, Parents Get Help Navigating US School System</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>After Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, many Ukrainian
refugees found themselves in the American state of Colorado, thanks to
the Uniting for Ukraine government program. For some families, educating
their children in the U.S. proved to be a challenge, but they’re getting
some extra help from a local nonprofit. Svitlana Prystynska has the
story, narrated by Anna Rice. (Camera: Volodymur Petruniv)</p>

been made and what remains unresolved. Also: What can we expect from
interest rate cutes in the New Year?

that should make you cry. So many of our friends on the web are happy to
let Facebook run the new Twitter. What is wrong with you. I don’t know
any better way to put it. Quitting Twitter is pointless, meaningless,
powerless. But not building Threads for Facebook is not meaningless. For
once can people look out for the future, keep the window open for
independence for writers and developers, and let us try out some new
ideas that might not be something Zuckerberg would love? Come on
already. This is the saddest moment, when there’s so much possibility,
and you all are ready to just throw it away. (And no, I don’t believe
for a minute they’re going to do anything that helps the Fediverse. I
know the playbook. Saying you’ll be open is what you do until you
dominate, then it’s just business. Truth is it’s always just business,
and saying you’re going to be open at this stage of network development
<i>is</i> good for business.)</p>

<p>
If you develop one of the ideas I write about here, tell me about it!
</p>
<p>
Let me try it out. Lately there have been people doing this, but for
some reason I don’t find out about the work until it’s too late.
</p>
<p>
What are people thinking? If I ask for something, there’s a reason – I
want to learn from it.
</p>
<p>
I think programmers are shy. You need to stop doing that. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
And of course I’ll share what I learn here on my blog, of course.

want to say this as loudly and clearly as I can. If we want independent
writing on the web to flourish, we need our own search engine, to help
us find each other, and build associations of writers, so we can
influence each other, and help developers create new tools for all
writers. Or simply to find something I wrote about 15 years ago, so I
can refer back to it. I really don’t have a good way yet to find stuff
I’ve written. It’s all there on the web, for crying out loud.
</p>
<p>
More important, we need to learn to work together, we do very very
little of that. It’s amazingly difficult to get a new idea heard by
other developers. This is a huge problem, it’s why we’ve always been
dominated by big companies who don’t care about what we do.
</p>
<p>
Start with a search engine for bloggers. I’ll help. And let’s do lots of
them, so no one can stand in the way of trying out new ideas.

moving on to this year’s BOTY, I thought HCR could help figure out how
we could move past merely reporting on Trump’s danger to democracy,
something that was clear going back to 2015, the news could start
reporting on The Resistance, what we’re doing to prevent the end of
democracy. And in order for that to happen, we have to do newsworthy
things for them to write about! We’re not doing that. It started out
well, with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Women%27s_March#:~:text=The%20Women's%20March%20was%20a,to%20the%20rights%20of%20women.">Woman’s
March on January 20, 2017</a>, but that was it. We can and must keep
showing up, and I’m not advocating huge marches, I want to see
neighborhood-level marching. Once a month, rain or shine, we all walk
(if possible) or drive to our voting places, where there will be music,
food, people with ideas, dancing, whatever you like. Making civic
participation a regular thing. You go because you want to be there. Not
against something but <i>for</i> all of us. All we have to do is figure
out how this works, how to beat the drum, to get the ball rolling. The
idea is that if we got close to 100 percent voter participation, our
democracy would be in the best shape it’s been in probably since
inception. I had another idea that’s worth considering. We should all
wear the same button, just a picture, no slogans, an idea of what we
stand for as Americans. It could be an American flag, or it could be a
photo of
<a href="http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html">Martin
Luther King</a>. The latter was my choice. People love the button, but
it didn’t catch on. If we all did, it’s omission would be noticed, and
we’d know there’s someone we should talk with about America and offer
them a free button, nicely, if they’ll put it on right now. Anyway, I’m
putting this out there again, and I’ll keep doing it.</p>

It’s crunch time at COP28. The United Nations climate summit is
officially scheduled to end tomorrow morning, but is likely to run over,
as much work remains even after a weekend of intense talks and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/cop28-al-jaber-tries-to-break-deadlock-with-circular-meeting?sref=a2d7LMhq&utm_source=cbnewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=2023-12-11&utm_campaign=Daily+Briefing+11+12+2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pleas</a>
for compromise. There is still no consensus on the language in the
global stocktake on the future of fossil fuels – phase out, phase down,
or otherwise. Any agreement to come out of COP must be unanimous,
meaning opposition from just one of the nearly 200 countries
participating can sink a deal. Oil giant Saudi Arabia has “flatly
opposed any language in a deal that would even mention fossil fuels,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/climate/saudi-arabia-cop28-fossil-fuels.html%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>
<em>The New York Times</em>, adding that Saudi diplomats have
intentionally slowed and obstructed the negotiation process. The United
States, India, Russia, China, and Iraq have all called for caveats or
provisions to a phase out. This morning U.N. Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres returned to the conference and called for an end to the fossil
fuel age. “Now is the time for maximum ambition and maximum
flexibility,” Guterres said.

“Perverse though it may seem, in one sense the strenuous efforts of

COP negotiators are considering a historic call for phasing out fossil
fuels in the summit’s global stocktake. The Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is working hard to convince its
members – and the world – that this would be a mistake. Last week OPEC’s
leader
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/climate/opec-cop28-climate-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged</a>
members to reject any text that “targets energy i.e. fossil fuels.” Over
the weekend the group hosted a youth event at the conference “aimed at
convincing young people to support fossil fuels,” Reuters
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/opec-pursues-charm-offensive-cop28-youths-2023-12-10/%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.

<p>
Tesla’s Cybertruck is eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit for
2023,
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/700104/tesla-cybertruck-tax-credit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> <em>Inside EVs</em>. The all-wheel-drive (AWD) variant and the
tri-motor Cyberbeast are both eligible for the incentive. But there’s a
catch: The tax credit is only available for pickups that cost less than
$80,000, which would disqualify the $99,990 Cyberbeast. And the AWD
version just barely qualifies at $79,990, but deliveries won’t start
until next year. Taken together, this means “there might be no tax
credit for Cybertrucks right now, period,” <em>Inside EVs</em> says. And
this is compounded by the fact that the EV tax credit system is changing
on January 1, and “nobody knows which — if any — EVs will qualify,”
writes
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024%20" target="_self">Heatmap’s
Emily Pontecorvo</a>. “All signs indicate that the list of qualifying
vehicles is set to shrink.”

The news follows the shock election of the right-wing candidate Javier
Milei as the nation’s next president. Milei has a history of climate
skepticism. He has called climate change a “socialist lie” and promised
to withdraw the country from the landmark climate agreement. “Yet, since
his victory three weeks ago, the self-described ‘anarcho-capitalist’ has
begun backpedalling on some of his more contentious policies,”

<em>The Telegraph</em>. Milei is a former TV star with “striking”
similarities to former President Donald Trump, from his wild hair to his
affinity for conspiracy theories,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/08/javier-milei-argentina-donald-trump/%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>

We all should name a BOTY, or give out any award we feel is deserved.
People think “well it’s just me and I don’t matter” – which is totally
true, and is why you might as well pick someone. At least <i>they’ll</i>
know you appreciate them. And it gets you to think about what you value,
which builds over time to a better understanding of everything. Last
year I <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915">chose</a>
Heather Cox Richardson, whose
<a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/">Substack site</a>
is a constant read for me. Every night an email arrives, at different
times, and if I’m up and in the mood, I’ll spend a few minutes with HCR
and it’s always illuminating. She was my choice last year because her
writing re-kindled my interest in American history, and I started
reading books on most slavery, something that was seriously missing from
my NYC education, and is so important to who we are as a country.</p>

of all sizes and shapes. I have a few of these myself. My

While affordable, accessible child care can help support a strong

<p>The Unix philosophy of using compact expert tools that do one thing
well and pipelining them together to manipulate data is a great idea and
has worked well for the past few decades. This philosophy was outlined
in the 1978 Foreword to the Bell System Technical Journal describing the
UNIX Time-Sharing System: Items i and ii are oft repeated, and for good
reason. But it is time to take this philosophy to the 21st century by
further defining a standard output format for non-interactive use. ↫

<p class="drop-caps">
The future of climate-friendly air travel might lie in a 20-foot
shipping container that was dropped off on the campus of the University
of Sheffield in England in late September.
</p>
<p>
Inside the box is a system developed by
<a href="https://www.missionzero.tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mission
Zero Technologies</a>, a London-based company, that extracts carbon
dioxide molecules directly from the ambient air. University researchers
purchased the tech for about $762,000 for a
<a href="https://terc.ac.uk/sustainable-aviation-fuels-innovation-centre/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pioneering
project</a> to turn the captured carbon into e-kerosene, a fuel that’s
chemically identical to what’s used in airplanes but is made without oil
or gas.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, Mission Zero announced that this mini “direct air capture”
plant is now officially up and running. It has the capacity to capture
50 tons of carbon dioxide per year. That’s tiny compared to the nearly
37 billion tons emitted by humans last year, but it’s sufficient for the
university’s quest to demonstrate that jet fuel made from CO2 can be
safe and sustainable.
</p>
<p>
“It is kind of a baby system, for sure,” Nicholas Chadwick, Mission
Zero’s CEO told me. “But we think it’s delivering something quite
unique.”

</p>
<p>
When it comes to safely propelling metal tubes weighing hundreds of
thousands of pounds 40,000 feet in the air, without burning fossil
fuels, there are two potential paths. We can use what are called
sustainable “drop in fuels,” cleaner versions of jet fuel that are
compatible with existing planes and engines, but still release carbon
emissions, like e-kerosene. Or, we can re-engineer planes entirely so
that they can be powered by hydrogen or batteries, neither of which
would release any carbon.
</p>
<p>
The first path is much more viable in the near term. Today, small
volumes of sustainable drop-in fuels are already in use. They are mostly
made from animal fat and used cooking oils — often literally
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/air-travel/the-smelly-greasy-truth-about-how-sustainable-aviation-fuel-is-made" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sucked
out of the fryers of fast food restaurants</a>. There’s also potential
to make sustainable drop-in fuels from biomass, like algae, wood
residues from the forest floor, agricultural waste like corn stalks, or
purpose-grown crops like sugar beets.
</p>
<p>
But these resources are limited. “There’s only so much used cooking oil
available in the world,” said Nikita Pavlenko, the program lead for
aviation fuels at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a
research nonprofit. There isn’t enough waste biomass either, he told me,
and growing crops for energy competes with food markets and can lead to
deforestation. This is why capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and using
it to produce e-kerosene is so promising. “The amount of energy and CO2
available is theoretically much, much higher.”
</p>
<p>
Theoretically is the key word there. Even though the concentration of
carbon in the air is high enough to warm the planet, it’s still
relatively dilute, and requires a lot of energy to capture. To make
e-kerosene, the CO2 has to be combined with hydrogen, which also
requires a lot of energy to produce in a clean way. Then the gas mixture
is put through a reactor that converts the gas into a liquid fuel.
</p>
<p>
“You’re kind of swimming upstream in terms of the chemistry and
thermodynamics of it,” said Anu Khan, the deputy director of science and
innovation at Carbon180. “And so it matters a lot where you get the
energy from.”
</p>
<p>
Mission Zero’s technology is unique on that front. Whereas
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climeworks-orca-data-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture" target="_self">Climeworks</a>
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heirloom-carbon-microsoft-removal" target="_self">Heirloom</a>,
two other direct air capture companies that have plants operating today,
rely on heat for their processes, the Sheffield project will run solely
on electricity — in part from a solar array on site. Chadwick told me
the system uses between three and five times less energy as a result,
depending on how it is operated.
</p>

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy

</p>
<p>
The company also has a unique business model. Climeworks and Heirloom
own and operate their own plants, and sell carbon credits to other
companies based on the amount of CO2 they remove from the atmosphere and
store permanently. Mission Zero, by contrast, is selling the technology
itself. Third parties can buy its shipping containers and use the system
to do whatever they choose, whether that’s storing the carbon
underground and selling credits, using the carbon to make fuels, or
something else.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Another benefit of Mission Zero’s tech, according to Chadwick, is that
it is made from off-the-shelf parts with established supply chains. The
company was able to deliver the project to the University of Sheffield
within seven months of landing the contract.
</p>
<p>
Using carbon captured from the atmosphere to make fuel is one element of
a larger vision that some climate advocates have for a “circular carbon
economy.” If the carbon is captured and turned into products using
renewable energy, the atmosphere will not be any worse-off.
</p>
<p>
Chadwick said the University researchers hope to develop a certification
process to guarantee the fuel’s safety. The U.K. is in the process of
introducing a
<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1147350/pathway-to-net-zero-aviation-developing-the-uk-sustainable-aviation-fuel-mandate.pdf" target="_blank">sustainable
aviation fuel mandate</a> that will require at least 10% of jet fuel to
be made from sustainable sources by 2030, and is considering an
additional mandate for some portion of that to come from carbon and
hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to get started now if the scale is going to be there in seven
years,” he told me.
