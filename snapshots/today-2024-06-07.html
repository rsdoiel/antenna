<h2 id="the-misguided-backlash-against-californias-sb-1047">The
misguided backlash against California’s SB-1047</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Gary Marcus blog</p>
<p>State Senator Scott Wiener and others in California have proposed a
bill, SB-1047m that would some modest (to my taste) restraints on AI. It
doesn’t call for a private right of action, which would allow individual
citizens to sue AI companies for a wide set of reasons; it doesn’t call
for ban on training or deploying AI, not even the kind of extremely
large language models some called for ban on. It certainly doesn’t call
for a ban on research, The most stringent rules don’t even apply to
training runs that cost less than a $100 million dollars, exempting all
or nearly all academic research, and most of what smaller and even
medium-sized startups could afford. It doesn’t call for the state to
make decisions about what can be deployed, as an FDA-like approval
process for drugs does.</p>

<h2 id="quick-out-of-the-box-bsd-support-for-the-topton-gm1">Quick
out-of-the-box BSD support for the Topton GM1</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>I bought a Topton GM1 Industrial Mini PC for my HomeLab. It is aimed
at running Slackware Linux but I wanted to have a quick look at how well
BSD OSes support it out-of-the-box. ↫ Joel Carnat That’s really all
there’s to this story. I just really, really love tiny industrial and
office computers and thin clients, and every time I see another one for
sale I really have to stop myself from buying one I have absolutely no
use for. There’s just something about how these little guys are built
that speaks to me – they’re different than regular PCs, but only
marginally so, making them fun to play around with, getting drivers for
everything, seeing if Linux and BSD have any issues with it, and so on.
They’re also often fanless, which is a major boon. The Dell thin client
I wrote about last week has been run through a gauntlet of operating
systems to see just how capable it is, and I’m surprise by just how much
you can do even with a pedestrian Pentium Silver. For now it’s running
Fedora GNOME to get an idea how the most default of default Linux
environments performs and feels – so I can include it in future articles
about it – but I think I’m going to set it up as a retrogaming console
using Batocera. Industrial, office, and thin client computers are just
fun to play around with, and they’re incredibly cheap when buying used.
If things like a Raspberry Pi are hard to get, backordered, or
overpriced due to demand outstripping supply, it’s definitely a good
idea to see if you can find some cast-off thin client or whatever for
your project instead.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
We learned this morning that the U.S. economy added 272,000 new jobs in
May. That’s a lot more than many economists predicted. On the other
hand, the unemployment rate did tick up to 4%. We’ll put those numbers
into context. Then, two federal agencies are launching two separate
antitrust probes into the giants of the artificial intelligence race.
And later: a look at candy maker Bazooka’s recent injection of
investment money from major athletes.

<h2 id="bidens-climate-optimism-is-smart-politics">Biden’s Climate
Optimism Is Smart Politics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQyNDc1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTkyMDkyNH0.EffOkOj1YCN9_jkaiZJNaiuMGgcgf_AbPv2ojCetG2U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Campaign strategists and political consultants have a lot of folk
theories that guide their work, some of which are even true. One common
one is that the more optimistic candidate wins, especially in
presidential races: Figures such as Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George
W. Bush, and Barack Obama who painted a bright vision of the future with
a smile on their faces triumphed over their more dour opponents. Some
political science research backs it up:
<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15327965pli0101_13" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>One
study</u></a> examined candidates’ rhetoric over four decades of
campaigns and found “the candidate who was more a pessimistic ruminator
lost 9 of 10 times.”
</p>
<p>
This presents a problem for those who want candidates to make climate
change advocacy a key part of their campaigns (and make promises they’ll
have to keep once they take office). If candidates want to be
optimistic, they may shy away from talking too much about a topic that
can be disturbing, with the potential of global catastrophe always
looming.
</p>
<p>
But we’re seeing the glimmers of something interesting in the current
election. Now it’s the forces of the fossil fuel status quo who sound
pessimistic, while those advocating more aggressive climate action are
the optimistic ones.
</p>
<p>
This is clearly a conscious choice on the part of the Biden campaign and
its allies. Using the Inflation Reduction Act and its climate
investments as the evidence, they’re telling a story in which the
administration is striding confidently into a better future, creating
jobs and cleaning the air at the same time. Pro-Biden political action
committees are airing ads (see
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnW8DQmZ5CM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZG6FNxfoUA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>,
or
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEoB4jQJtQk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>)
featuring sweeping drone shots of wind turbines and solar arrays, and
slow-motion scenes from high-tech factories where good strong Americans
are doing satisfying work for good pay, all while stirring music plays
in the background. It’s morning in America, and the sun is shining on
our photovoltaic panels.
</p>
<p>
The $80 million that the group Climate Power is
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/16/politics/climate-power-biden-campaign-ads/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>planning
to spend</u></a> on ads for Biden, to take one example, may not blanket
the airwaves from now to November, but it’s still a significant amount
devoted to telling a feel-good climate story, even if that story is only
a partial one. If that’s what will motivate voters more than encouraging
them to marinate in bad news about rising temperatures and CO2
emissions, that’s what we can expect candidates to do.
</p>
<p>
And the contrast with Biden’s opponent is striking. These days, Donald
Trump is less likely to call climate change a hoax invented by the
Chinese government
(<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
he used to</u></a>), and more likely to simply
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/politics/fact-check-trump-sea-levels-ocean-climate-change/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dismiss
it</u></a> as nothing to worry about. But when it comes to anything
involving clean energy, his rhetoric turns dark and foreboding. He has a
long and weird obsession with the supposed horror of wind turbines,
which he
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/10/politics/biden-trump-windmill-cancer/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>believes</u></a>
cause cancer, kill innumerable birds, and are
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/climate/trump-clean-energy-fact-check.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>driving
whales crazy</u></a>.” He
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/04/17/trump-wind-power-oil-executives/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recently
told</u></a> a group of oil executives, “I hate wind.” Clearly.
</p>
<p>
When talk turns to electric cars, Trump is just as grim, painting them
as nightmarish misery-mobiles for both those condemned to drive them and
the workers who won’t get to build them. “The cars don’t go far, they
cost too much, and they’re all made in China,”
<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-rally-in-ohio" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
says</u></a>, and
“<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/03/18/trumps-bloodbath-tirade-contained-a-warning-on-chinese-cars-here-are-the-facts-00147600" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>if
I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a bloodbath</u></a>” for the whole
auto industry. At
<a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-after-hush-money-conviction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
press conference</u></a> he held after being convicted on 34 felony
counts, he got barely a minute into his remarks before going off on EVs:
“They want to stop you from having cars with their ridiculous mandates
that make it impossible for you to get a car or afford a car; make it
very possible for China to build all of our cars.” If ever there was a
“pessimistic ruminator,” it’s Trump.
</p>
<p>
You don’t have to be planning to buy an EV this year to be more
attracted to Biden’s optimistic picture of American workers building
them than Trump’s nightmarish vision of automotive dystopia. And even if
some portion of the population cheers when they hear Trump promising to
“Drill, drill, drill,” it’s now the forces of the status quo that sound
pessimistic when it comes to energy, denying that the country is capable
of innovation and adaptation. We have to just keep doing what we’re
doing, they say, because we can’t have anything better.
</p>
<p>
If there’s a risk of being too optimistic in a campaign, it might be
that it saps the urgency from the climate issue and produces a bias
toward easy, low-cost policy solutions rather than hard choices. But the
Biden administration’s record — which though far from perfect includes
both crowd-pleasing spending programs and stricter regulation of
emissions that have produced strong opposition — suggests that what
matters most is whether a president and the people in their
administration care about the climate at all.
</p>
<p>
As Heatmap’s Jeva Lange has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>explained</u></a>,
the fact that few voters respond “climate change” when asked to name the
country’s most pressing problem doesn’t mean they don’t believe it’s
important. And if you convince a voter that cleaner energy is a
worthwhile goal to pursue, does it matter if she’s thinking more about
job opportunities and lower electric bills than about reducing
emissions?
</p>
<p>
It also wouldn’t be a bad thing if people came to see the issue as a
contrast between the future and the past, innovative thinking and
hidebound fear of change. Two decades ago, Mark Schmitt
<a href="https://markschmitt.typepad.com/decembrist/2004/09/its_what_the_is.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coined</u></a>
one of those pithy bits of insight political writers are always
searching for when he wrote that in a campaign, “It’s not what you say
about the issues, it’s what the issues say about you.” His example was
John McCain’s advocacy for campaign finance reform, which wasn’t at the
top of the voters’ priority list but communicated that McCain was a
principled reformer unafraid of taking on the powerful.
</p>
<p>
In the same way, advocacy for clean energy can help candidates build an
optimistic image even apart from the policy debate over whether and how
the country should decarbonize. If all those ads with gleaming solar
farms and humming factory floors lead people to associate the climate
issue with innovation and hope rather than deprivation and misery (as
Trump and others would have it), then more and more candidates may want
to make that part of their image, too. And the chances of positive
policy change will only increase.

id="microsoft-blocks-windows-11-workaround-that-enabled-local-accounts">Microsoft
blocks Windows 11 workaround that enabled local accounts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Before PC users can enjoy everything Windows 11 has on tap, they must
first enter an e-mail address that’s linked to a Microsoft account. If
you don’t have one, you’ll be asked to create one before you can start
setting it up. A frequently used trick to circumvent this block is a
small but ingenious step. By entering a random e-mail address and
password, which doesn’t exist and causes the link to fail, you end up
directly with the creation of a local account and can thus avoid
creating an official account with Microsoft. ↫ Laura Pippig at PCWorld
Microsoft has now “fixed” this trick, and it’s no longer possible to use
it. The other popular method of circumventing the Microsoft account
requirement, by opening the command prompt during installation and
running OOBE, still works, but one has to wonder how long it’s going to
take before Microsoft plugs that method, too. It seems the company is
hell-bent on getting every consumer onto the Microsoft Account train,
come hell or high water, so I wouldn’t be surprised seeing local
accounts eventually being positioned as a “pro” or even “enterprise”
feature that will simply no longer be available on consumer PCs. I don’t
think there’s anything inherently wrong with offering an online account
option, but the keyword here is option. You should always be able to set
up any computer to run with a regular old local account, even if only
because internet access isn’t always a given in many places around the
world. Add the obvious privacy concerns to that – an issue amplified by
Recall – and I doubt users’ desire to run a local account and jump
through hoops to do so will fade any time soon.</p>

Biden has a goal of developing commercial fusion within a decade.
Nuclear fusion, the process by which stars produce energy, is seen as a

<li>Researchers use ‘charcoal sponge’ to remove CO2 from the air
</h3>
<p>
Researchers at the University of Cambridge say they’ve discovered a new,
energy efficient way of removing carbon dioxide from the air using
low-cost materials. Their direct air capture process utilizes activated
charcoal, a cheap material often used to help filter and purify water.
Using a similar process to charging a battery, the charcoal is “charged”
in such a way that makes certain ions accumulate in its pores. Those
ions bond with CO2, removing the gas directly from the air. Once the CO2
has been collected, it has to be released from the “charcoal sponge” and
stored. This is done by heating the charcoal to about 100 degrees
Celsius. This relatively low temperature is important, because it can be
achieved using renewable electricity, whereas “in most materials
currently used for CO2 capture from air, the materials need to be heated
to temperatures as high as 900°C, often using natural gas,”

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming more easily

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
My name is JF Martin, a.k.a. Numeric Citizen in the digital space. I’m
56 years old. I live in Montreal, Canada. I’m a French Canadian. I have
a master’s degree in computer science (1993). My research field was user
experience and user interface quality assessment. I credit my passion
for Apple for this choice of research field because at that time, in
1990-1993, there was a hot debate about which was better, the PC or the
Mac, and I advocated for better user interfaces. I’ve been working in
the information technology field for thirty years. I wrote about that
<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/celebrating-reflecting-on-my-30-years-career-in-it/">here</a>.
My first job was to work for an Apple dealer. I eventually moved to a
more traditional IT type of work, doing things in IT infrastructures,
first with PC deployments in small and medium enterprises, then in data
center related technologies deployment and management.
</p>
<p>
Apple played a significant influence in my life since 1983. I have
always preferred creative people and Apple has attracted them more than
any other computer brand. I always felt at home in this user community,
even though I’m a rather analytic guy professionally. Yet, I consider
myself a compulsive creator. Creating something has always been part of
my life. When I was a young boy, I was building something with Legos.
Then, it was replaced with photography. Then, computers came to my life,
first with a Commodore and then with an Apple Macintosh in 1985. Since
then, computers, i.e. the Mac, the iPad, have always been central to any
creative project. One of them being an indie iOS developer from 2009 to
2013 when I was developing apps for the iPhone. Since then, I mostly
spend my time as a blogger and a writer. Photography is also one of my
creative hobbies, and you can find my work here on
<a href="https://pixelfed.social/numericcitizen">Pixelfed</a> and
<a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">Glass</a>.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
First, let’s clear something out of the way: using the Numeric Citizen
name. To me, Numeric Citizen was evocative of a citizen living in
cyberspace, sharing things with it, learning things from it, etc. I
thought it was a good parallel with real-world citizenship. But
eventually, I found out that in English, the more frequent word for this
would have been “Digital Citizen”, but I couldn’t get the right domain
name for it, and it was too late, so I decided to keep the Numeric
Citizen moniker.
</p>
<p>
Now, about my blog. Well, I have a few blogs and websites. Four, to be
precise. But let’s go back in time. In 1994, I had a Mac and created a
website about meteorology. It was a science-related educative project.
This lasted a couple of years. Next, in 2006, I experimented with Apple
iWeb, part of the iLife suite. Sadly, I can’t remember what my website
was about, but I do remember that I preferred the version of Apple where
RSS was still a thing in Safari and iWeb let anyone own a blog for a
MobileMe subscription. It’s too bad that Apple dropped iWeb.
</p>
<p>
I started blogging in 2009 using Google’s Blogger platform. This time,
it was about sharing my experiences and discoveries while developing
apps for the iPhone. Eventually, I stopped doing that and kept the blog
running until 2013. That was it for Blogger. Then, in 2015, I went back
to blogging, this time on
<a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, and it was a more
general-purpose blog where I was sharing my thoughts about Apple, among
other things. Since then, I’ve been writing about Apple, technology, and
photography. Last year, I completed a migration out of
<a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> to
<a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost.org</a>. I couldn’t be happier. Ghost
is much simpler to use and manage (no plugins!). But that’s not all.
Starting in 2018, I opened a blog on Micro.blog. Since then, I’ve been
blogging regularly, and I love it. My website on Ghost is more dedicated
to long-form articles, which require more research and writing work. My
blog on Micro.blog is about sharing short thoughts and comments about
the same subjects.
</p>
<p>
I often consider myself a digital nomad (or a numeric nomad?). I
frequently try different things and don’t hesitate to move from one
place to another if I see better value and functionality. Last year, I
was really on the move, but I think I will settle for a while once I
finish my migration from SmugMug to PixelFed.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a highly iterative type of guy. I rarely start writing an article
and finish it in one stretch. It’s way too demanding for me. I have a
few parallel ongoing research and writing projects and do round-robin
writing across them. I’m using Craft Docs for most of my writing needs,
an app I love dearly. I developed a rather sophisticated template for my
research needs. This template helps me organize my research and support
my writing efforts with Craft. When I’m ready to publish, I export to
Ulysses, do the final proofing using Grammarly, select the destination
and hit publish. I wish I could do all this from Craft, but it’s
currently impossible.
</p>
<p>
Inspiration comes without warning. I often go for a walk and think about
so many things. I usually come back with an idea about a new article or
a tweak to my creative workflows and start working on it as soon as
possible. My creative hobby is what makes me thrive in life. Without it,
the last three years with the COVID pandemic would have been so hard on
me.
</p>
<p>
I write a lot about my creative process and the tools that I use all the
time. Occasionally, I’ll share an update about my creative workflow when
there are enough changes to it. You can read about my last update right
<a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/content-creator-workflow-update-as-of-2023-11">here</a>.
These articles are posted on what I call: a blog about blogging. It is
currently available as a series of shared documents built-in Craft, but
I recently started re-publishing them on a
<a href="https://meta.numericcitizen.me/">new Micro.blog website</a> so
that I could let people follow my updates using RSS, which Craft doesn’t
support.
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
My creative environment is relatively simple: my home. I do like to go
to coffee shops. I
<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/on-creative-work-in-a-coffee-shop/">wrote
about these</a>. I also love to write on my terrasse outside during
summer. Bird noises and the wind are indeed delightful while writing.
The best triggers for my creativity come down to the time of the day. I
love working early in the morning and during the weekends. At night or
late in the evening, I’m less into it and find it hard to focus. One
thing is clear: many of my ideas come when I do something other than
creating, like while taking a walk or… taking my shower. 😅
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
I depend on three hosting solutions: Ghost, Micro.blog, and Craft Docs.
I don’t self-host anything. I don’t have time for that (and I’m probably
too old, too). At some point, I contemplated the idea of self-hosting a
Hugo instance, but when I started to dig a bit into Hugo’s inner
workings, I quickly changed my mind. I’m a « SaaS » type of guy, I
guess.
</p>
<p>
My main domain name is
“<a href="http://numericcitizen.me/">numericcitizen.me</a>” and I use a
subdomain for each of my publishing space or “channel”. Publishing on
Ghost goes to
“<a href="http://numericcitizen.me/">numericcitizen.me</a>”, but sharing
on Micro.blog goes to
<a href="https://blog.numericcitizen.me/">blog.numericcitizen.me</a>
while my metablog goes to
<a href="https://meta.numericcitizen.me/">meta.numericcitizen.me</a>.
Photos shared on Pixelfed photos can be seen by visiting
<a href="https://photos.numericcitizen.me/">photos.numericcitizen.me</a>.You
get the idea. I have so many small websites (too many?) and so I created
a hub page that can be reached via, you guessed it,
<a href="https://hub.numericcitizen.me/">hub.numericicitizen.me</a>. The
latter is hosted on Micro.blog.
</p>
<p>
But what about newsletters for those who prefer the email experience? I
tried Substack and was happy with it until I wasn’t. I tried Buttondown
but eventually settled on Ghost. It was one of the many reasons I
decided to leave WordPress behind. Under Substack, I used to have the
<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/numeric-citizen-introspection-24/">Introspection
newsletter</a>, which wasn’t about introspection but rather a collection
of thoughts and links divided into sections. I stopped publishing this
newsletter in September 2022. One year later, I started a new one
covering
<a href="https://numericcitizen.me/my-weekly-creative-summary-for-the-week-of-2024-08/">my
creative week</a>. And I hope to continue publishing this one for a long
time because of the pleasure I get while putting it together.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
It’s a hard question. We can always do things differently but the way I
see it is simple: my current state is essentially the culmination of all
my past experiences, good or bad. It’s an infinite learning process,
always feeding the future “me”.
</p>
<p>
I often wonder if a single “big” website would be better than having so
many small ones. I could achieve similar results by using categories and
tags with each post. But in the end, I prefer dedicated and more focused
but connected silos.
</p>
<p>
Regarding RSS feeds, I wish I had known about FeedPress earlier so that
my readers wouldn’t have to change their subscriptions each time I moved
my stuff from one place to another. It’s a great way to centralize feeds
from different places where I publish content. Someone can subscribe to
my megafeed to see everything I share online.
</p>
<p>
I wish I had done one thing: each time I made a significant design
change to one of my websites or moved from one platform to another, I
wish I had kept a screenshot of the previous design. I don’t have a
visual memory of my journey as a blogger. I find this a bit sad.
</p>
<p>
And yes, I still prefer Digital Citizen over Numeric Citizen. 🤷🏻‍♂️
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
Ghost isn’t exactly cheap (300$ per year), but their support is stellar.
Micro.blog is a bargain (120$ per year) for everything you get. Craft is
rather a cheap option, too (at 116$ per year) if you do more than
note-taking with it, which I do. All in all, if you do the math, my
online presence comes at a cost. I’ll let you do the math. I didn’t
count domain name registration and other stuff like apps and other
services making
<a href="https://world.numericcitizen.io/meta-toolset">my digital
toolset</a>. You can see the full details right
<a href="https://crafted.numericcitizen.me/current-subscriptions">here</a>,
on my “Subscriptions” page.
</p>
<p>
Now, I want to share a few words about monetization possibilities. I
have tried many times, and it’s tough. Over the years, I slowly learned
that when someone shows support with a subscription to my website or
sends me money, I consider this a gift. Visitors to my main website on
Ghost can subscribe for free or pay a small fee to show appreciation.
That’s about it. I don’t make money with my YouTube channel because I
haven’t met the requirements yet. I’m looking to make money there. I did
receive some money via PayPal once or twice. I wasn’t expecting that.
It’s cool. I said a big thank you.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
I think you should give a try with
<a href="https://maique.eu/about/">Maique</a>. He’s from Portugal. He is
passionate about photography and shares a lot of creative content on
different platforms, mostly open ones. I think he could share a lot as a
blogger who constantly tries new things. We’re cosmic brothers.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
Oh, did I mention my YouTube channel? It’s a complement to my blogs. I
know I’m spread everywhere, but it is still manageable. You can find it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/numericcitizenvideos">here</a>. I
also have a podcast because I wanted to test the medium, and I quite
like it, too, but I don’t produce new episodes often enough. And yes,
I’m an amateur photographer with a Glass
<a href="https://glass.photo/numericcitizen">profile</a>. I don’t read
books. I don’t play games, but I prefer experimenting with modern media
(words, audio, video, images).

id="biden-apologizes-to-zelenskyy-for-monthslong-congressional-holdup-to-weapons-that-let-russia-gain">Biden
apologizes to Zelenskyy for monthslong congressional holdup to weapons
that let Russia gain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PARIS — U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday for the first time
publicly apologized to Ukraine for a monthslong congressional holdup in
American military assistance that let Russia make gains on the
battlefield, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for
bipartisan U.S. support “like it was during World War II.”</p>
<p>Speaking in Paris, a day after they both attended ceremonies marking
the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, Biden apologized
to the Ukrainian people for the weeks of not knowing if more assistance
would come while conservative Republicans in Congress held up a $61
billion military aid package for Ukraine for six months.</p>
<p>Still, the Democratic president insisted that the American people
were standing by Ukraine for the long haul. “We’re still in. Completely.
Thoroughly,” he said.</p>
<p>The apology — and Zelenskyy’s plea for rock-solid support akin to the
allied coalition in WWII — served as a reminder that for all of Biden’s
talk of an unflagging U.S commitment to Ukraine, recalcitrance among
congressional Republicans and an isolationist strain in American
politics has led to Russian gains on the battlefield. And, although
unremarked upon, the specter of Donald Trump’s candidacy loomed over the
discussion, as the Republican former president and the presumptive
nominee has spoken positively of Russian President Vladimir Putin and
sparked Ukrainian concerns that he would call for it to cede territory
to end the conflict.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy pressed for all Americans to support his country’s defense
against Russia’s invasion, and he thanked lawmakers for eventually
coming together to approve the weapons package, which has allowed
Ukraine to stem Russian advances in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“It’s very important that in this unity, United States of America,
all American people stay with Ukraine like it was during World War II,”
Zelenskyy said. “How the United States helped to save human lives, to
save Europe. And we count on your continuing support in standing with us
shoulder to shoulder.”</p>
<p>The United States is by far Kyiv’s biggest supplier of wartime
support, and Ukraine is trying to fend off an intense Russian offensive
in eastern areas of the country. The push is focused on the Ukrainian
border regions of Kharkiv and Donetsk, but Ukrainian officials say it
could spread as Russia’s bigger army seeks to make its advantage
tell.</p>
<p>The offensive is seeking to exploit Kyiv’s shortages of ammunition
and troops along the roughly 1,000-kilometer front line.</p>
<p>The slow pace of delivery of pledged Western weaponry has long
frustrated Zelenskyy, as has Biden’s hesitation over supplying more
hardware for fear of provoking Russian President Vladimir Putin. That
has caused tension in their relationship.</p>
<p>The U.S. will send about $225 million in military aid to Ukraine,
Biden announced Friday. The latest package includes munitions for the
High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or HIMARS, as well as mortar
systems and an array of artillery rounds, U.S. officials said
Thursday.</p>
<p>Biden cast the additional aid in his meeting with Zelenskyy as money
to “reconstruct the electric grid” in Ukraine, a reference aides said
was to additional air defense and missile defense systems in the new
package.</p>
<p>Easing their stance amid Russia’s most recent onslaught and with
Ukraine’s army reeling, some NATO allies including the U.S. said last
week they would allow Ukraine to use weapons they deliver to Kyiv to
carry out limited attacks inside Russia.</p>
<p>That step brought a furious response from the Kremlin, which warned
that Europe’s biggest conflict since World War II could spin out of
control.</p>
<p>Biden and Zelenskyy attended the anniversary events of D-Day in
Normandy, northern France, on Thursday, along with European leaders who
have supported Kyiv’s efforts in the war. Biden pledged “we will not
walk away” from Ukraine, drawing a direct line from the fight to
liberate Europe from Nazi domination to today’s war against Russian
aggression.</p>
<p>Ukraine depicts its fight against the Kremlin’s forces as a clash
between Western democratic freedom and Russian tyranny. Russia says it
is defending itself against a menacing eastward expansion of the NATO
military alliance.</p>
<p>In a 20-minute speech Friday at the National Assembly, the lower
house of the French parliament, Zelenskyy drew a parallel with the
sacrifices made during World War II and his country’s current fight.</p>
<p>“This battle is a crossroads,” Zelenskyy said. “A moment where we can
now write history the way we need it. Or we can become victims of
history as it suits … our enemy.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy, who spoke in Ukrainian, was frequently interrupted by
lawmakers’ applause and cheers. He prompted a standing ovation when he
said in French: “Dear France, I thank you for standing by our side as we
defend life.”</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, announced late Thursday
that France will provide Ukraine with its Mirage combat aircraft.</p>
<p>Macron has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine. He said in February
that putting Western troops on the ground in Ukraine is not “ruled
out.”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy began a day of meetings in Paris with an official welcome
ceremony at the golden-domed Invalides monument, site of Napoleon’s
tomb.</p>
<p>During the day, Zelenskyy was set to visit the Nexter arms
manufacturer in Versailles, which makes the Caesar self-propelled
howitzers that are among the weapons provided by France to Kyiv’s
forces.</p>
<p>He was also to meet with Macron at the Élysée Palace.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy’s foreign trips aim to keep Ukraine’s plight in the public
eye, secure more military help for its fight against Russia’s invasion
and lock in long-term Western support through bilateral alliances.</p>
<p>France and Ukraine in February signed a 10-year bilateral security
agreement. Zelenskyy has since signed similar bilateral agreements with
many European countries</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Imagine a battery. Maybe you envision popping one into a fading
flashlight or a dead remote controller. Perhaps you consider the little
icon on the top of your phone or laptop screen, precariously dipping
into the red while you search for a charger. Or you might picture the
powerful battery pack inside your electric vehicle, helping to make gas
stations obsolete.<br/>
</p>
<p>
These minor to major electrochemical marvels are fine, but the
opportunity space for energy storage is so, so much larger — and
weirder. Water moving between two reservoirs is a classic un-classic
battery, but compressed air stored in a cavern, raising and lowering
heavy blocks, even freezing water or heating up rocks can also all be
batteries. And these methods of energy storage have the potential to be
enormously helpful where standard lithium-ion batteries fall short —
namely for long-duration energy storage and large-scale heating and
cooling applications.
</p>
<p>
Lithium-ion batteries still dominate the market, Kevin Shang, a senior
research analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, told me. But
“over the next 10 years, we do see more and more long-duration energy
storage coming into play.” Typical lithium-ion batteries can provide
only about four hours of continual power,
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/lithium-ion-batteries-beat-novel-long-duration-tech-in-california-contest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>occasionally
reaching up to eight</u> —</a> though that’s an economic constraint
rather than a technical one. Generally speaking, it’s too pricey for
lithium-ion to meet longer-duration needs in today’s market. So as
states and countries get real about their clean energy targets and
install more wind and solar generation, they need some way to ensure
their grids’ reliability when the weather’s not cooperating or demand is
peaking.
</p>
<p>
“There’s a need for something that can substitute for natural gas,”
Logan Goldie-Scot, director of market research at the sustainable
infrastructure investment firm Generate Capital told me. Almost no one
believes lithium-ion batteries will be a viable alternative. “And so
then it is an open question of whether that role will be filled by
long-duration energy storage, by green hydrogen, or by clean firm power”
like nuclear or geothermal, he said.
</p>
<p>
There are some novel battery chemistries and configurations out there,
from
<a href="https://formenergy.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Form
Energy</u></a>’s iron-air batteries to
<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/10/25/2766663/0/en/CMBlu-Energy-receives-106-7-million-strategic-growth-investment-from-infrastructure-technology-company-STRABAG-SE.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>flow
batteries</u></a> that store their electrolytes in separate tanks to
<a href="https://www.eose.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>zinc-based
batteries</u></a>. But there are also numerous more creative,
non-chemical, not-what-you-might-consider-a-battery batteries vying for
a role in the long-duration storage market.
</p>
<h3>
A battery that stores compressed air in caverns
</h3>
<p>
Founded back in 2010, Toronto-based Hydrostor has been pursuing
“advanced compressed air energy storage” for a while now. Essentially,
the system uses off-peak, surplus, or renewable grid energy to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOWjwwKSR78" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>compress
air and pump it into</u></a> a water-filled cavern, displacing that
water to the surface. Then when energy is needed, it releases the water
back into the cavern, pushing the air upward to mix with stored heat,
which turns a turbine and produces electricity.
</p>
<p>
“Everybody has talked about long-duration storage for probably the past
five years or so. The markets have not been there to pay for it at all.
And that’s starting to change,” Jon Norman, Hydrostor’s president, told
me.
</p>
<p>
Part of Hydrostor’s pitch is that its tech is a “proven pathway,” as it
involves simply integrating and repurposing preexisting systems and
technologies to produce energy. It’s also cheaper than lithium-ion
storage, with no performance degradation over a project’s lifetime.
Major investors are buying it — the company raised
<a href="https://hydrostor.ca/hydrostor-secures-us250-million-investment-from-goldman-sachs-asset-management-to-accelerate-growth/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$250
million from Goldman Sachs</u></a> in 2022, to be paid out in tranches
tied to project milestones. At the time, it was one of the largest
investments ever made in long-duration energy storage.
</p>
<p>
The company has operated a small 1.75 megawatt facility in Canada since
2019, but now with Goldman’s help it’s scaling significantly, developing
a 500 megawatt grid-scale project in California in partnership with a
community choice aggregator, as well as a 200 megawatt microgrid project
in a remote town in New South Wales, Australia.
</p>
<p>
“Our bread and butter application is serving the needs of grids and
utilities that are managing capacity and keeping the lights on all the
time,” Norman told me. The company’s projects under development are
designed to deliver eight hours of energy. “That’s what the market’s
calling for right now,” Norman said, though theoretically Hydrostor
could handle multi-day storage.
</p>
<p>
Standard lithium-ion batteries have shown that they can be economical in
the eight-hour range too, though. Back in 2020, a coalition of community
choice aggregators in California requested bids for long-duration
storage projects with at least eight hours of capacity. While Hydrostor
and numerous other startups threw their hats in the ring, the
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/lithium-ion-batteries-beat-novel-long-duration-tech-in-california-contest" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coalition
ultimately selected a standard lithium-ion battery project</u></a> for
development.
</p>
<p>
While this could be viewed as a hit to more nascent technologies,
Hydrostor said the process ultimately led to the company’s 25-year, 200
megawatt offtake contract with Central Coast Community Energy, which
will purchase power from the company’s 500 megawatt project in
California’s Central Valley, set to come online in 2030. But that long
lead time could be one of the main reasons why Hydrostor didn’t win the
coalition’s bid in the first place.
</p>
<p>
“When you consider the very pertinent needs for energy storage systems
today in California <em><em>and</em></em> yesterday, a technology that
is not due to come online for another six years – I don’t think you’re
even yet at the cost comparison conversation,” Goldie-Scot told me, in
reference to Hydrostor’s timeline. “It’s just, how soon can some of
these companies deliver a project?” Generate recently acquired esVolta,
a prominent developer of lithium-ion battery storage projects.
</p>
<p>
But ultimately, Norman says he doesn’t really view Hydrostor as in
competition with lithium-ion. “We would even add [traditional] batteries
to our system if we wanted to provide really fast response times,” he
told me. He says the use cases are just different, and that he has faith
that compressed air storage will eventually prove to be the superior
option for grid-scale, long-duration applications.
</p>
<h3>
A battery that stores kinetic energy in heavy blocks
</h3>
<p>
Another company taking inspiration from pumped storage hydropower is
Energy Vault. Founded in 2017, the Swiss company is pursuing a
“gravity-based” system that can store up to 24 hours of energy. While
the design of its system has shifted over the years, the basic concept
has remained the same: Using excess grid energy to lift heavy blocks
(initially via cranes, now via specialized elevators), and then lowering
those blocks to spin a turbine when there’s energy demand.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.energyvault.com/newsroom/energy-vault-closes-series-b-funding-with-110-million-investment-from-softbank-vision-fund" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
company raised $110 million</u></a> from Softbank Vision Fund in 2019,
but failed to find an immediate market for its tech. “When we founded
the company, we started thinking long-duration was going to be required
much more quickly, and hence the focus on gravity,” Rob Piconi, Energy
Vault’s CEO, told me.
</p>
<p>
But instead of waiting around for the long-duration market to boom, the
company went public via SPAC in early 2022 and
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/why-energy-vault-went-from-disrupting-batteries-to-selling-them" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reinvented
itself</u></a>. Now it makes much of its revenue selling the sort of
traditional lithium-ion energy storage systems that it once sought to
replace, and has made moves into the
<a href="https://www.energyvault.com/projects/calistoga" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>green
hydrogen space</u></a>, too.
</p>
<p>
“The near term difficulty for many of these long-duration storage
companies is that we’re still relatively early on in the scaling of
lithium-ion,” Goldie-Scot, told me, noting that
<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-electric-chinas-iron-based-batteries-are-even-cheaper-than-we-thought?rc=mfdrgj" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prices
for Chinese-made batteries</u></a> have plunged in the past year.
Generate usually only invests in tech that’s well-proven and ready to
scale up. So while lithium-ion alternatives will look more and more
attractive as the world moves toward full decarbonization, in the
interim, “there’s a gap between that longer term need and where the
market is today.”
</p>
<p>
Piconi agrees. “If you look at storage deployments 95% to 98% of them
are all this shorter duration type of storage right now, because that’s
where the market is,” he said, though he added that he’s seeing demand
pick up, especially in places like California that are
<a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/long-duration-energy-storage-program#:~:text=The%20Long%20Duration%20Energy%20Storage%20program%20invests%20up%20to%20%24330,energy%20storage%20systems%20across%20California." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>investing
heavily</u></a> in storage.
</p>
<p>
All that’s to say the company hasn’t given up on its foundational
concept —
<a href="https://www.energyvault.com/projects/cn-rudong" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>its
first commercial-scale gravity energy storage system</u></a> was
recently connected to the grid in China, and the company has
<a href="https://www.energyvault.com/projects/zhangye" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>broken
ground on a second facility</u></a> in the country as well. These
facilities provide four hours of energy storage duration, which
lithium-ion batteries can also easily achieve — but the selling point,
Piconi says, is that unlike lithium-ion, gravity storage systems don’t
catch fire, rely on critical minerals, or degrade over time. And once
the market demands it, Energy Vault can provide power for much longer.
</p>
<p>
Still, the upfront costs of Energy Vault’s system can be daunting for
risk-averse utilities. So in an effort to lower prices, the company
recently unveiled a series of
<a href="https://www.energyvault.com/products/g-vault" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
gravity storage prototypes</u></a> that leverage either existing slopes
or multi-purpose skyscrapers. They were designed in partnership with the
architecture and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, the
company behind
<a href="https://www.som.com/projects/burj-khalifa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
world’s tallest building</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The market may not have been ready five years ago, Piconi told me. But
“in 12 to 24 months, we’re going to start to see gravity pop up,” he
projected.
</p>
<h3>
A battery that stores thermal energy in ice
</h3>
<p>
But wait, there’s more. Perhaps one of the best use cases for
lithium-ion alternatives is in onsite, direct heating and cooling
applications. That’s what the Israeli company Nostromo Energy is focused
on, aiming to provide cleaner, cheaper air conditioning for large
buildings like offices, school campuses, hotels, and data centers.
</p>
<p>
The company uses off-peak or surplus renewable energy to freeze water,
storing it for later use in modular cells. Then, as temperatures rise
and air conditioning turns on, that
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Hsif8pmAU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>frozen
water will cool down the building</u></a> without the need for
energy-intensive chillers, which commercial buildings normally rely
upon. The system can be configured to discharge energy for
two-and-a-half all the way up to 10 hours.
</p>
<p>
“Because air conditioning is roughly half of the electricity consumption
of a building, we can provide that half from stored energy. And that’s
overall a huge relief on the grid,” Nostromo’s CEO Yoram Ashery told me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/antora-rondo-energy-thermal-batteries" target="_self"><u>While
a lot of (my) attention</u></a> has been focused on how thermal
batteries can help decarbonize heat-intensive industrial processes, and
much has been written about the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heat-pumps-national-renewable-energ-lab" target="_self"><u>benefits
of electric heat pumps</u></a> over gas-powered heating, cooling is
sometimes overlooked. That’s at least partially because air conditioning
is already electrified.
</p>
<p>
But as more of our vehicles, appliances, and systems go electric, strain
on the grid is poised to increase, especially during times of peak
energy demand in the late afternoon and evening as people return home
from the office before the sun goes down. Nostromo’s system can help
shift that load by charging either midday (when solar is abundant) or at
night (when wind is peaking), and discharging as demand for AC ramps
throughout the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
Goldie-Scot said thermal storage technologies like this “offer something
that some of the other technologies that are purely power-focused
cannot. But they are still competing against relatively cheap natural
gas.”
</p>
<p>
The upfront cost of the system, $2 to $3 million, is also nothing to
sneeze at. But Ashery says it will fully pay for itself after just five
years, as building owners stand to see significant savings on their
electricity bills by shifting their demand to off-peak hours.
</p>
<p>
While one could theoretically power a building’s AC system using large
lithium-ion-batteries, “it’s a problem to put big lithium batteries
inside buildings,” Ashery told me. That’s due to the fire risk, which
could impact insurance premiums for businesses, as well as space issues
— these batteries would need to be container-sized to run an HVAC
system. “That’s why only 1% of energy storage currently goes into
commercial/industrial buildings,” Ashery wrote in a follow up email.
</p>
<p>
Shang told me that he sees so-called “behind the meter” applications
like this as promising early markets for long-duration storage tech,
especially given that utilities are “pretty cautious to adopt these
technologies on a large scale.” But ultimately, he believes that policy
is what’s really going to jumpstart this market.
</p>
<p>
“For long-duration storage, it may look years ahead, but actually the
future is now,” he said. Because some of these new systems take longer
to design and build, Shang told me, “you have to invest now. For the
policies, you have to be ready now to support the development of these
[long-duration energy storage] technologies.”
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration is certainly trying. All energy storage tech —
thermal, compressed air, gravity, and lithium-ion — stands to benefit
from generous IRA tax credits, which will cover 30% of a project’s cost,
assuming it meets certain labor standards. Additional savings can accrue
if a project meets domestic content requirements or is sited in a
qualifying “energy community,” such as a low-income area that derives
significant revenue from fossil fuel production.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/long-duration-storage-shot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
Department of Energy’s ultimate goal</u></a> is to reduce the cost of
grid-scale long-duration energy storage by 90% this decade (with “long”
defined as 10-plus hours). And last year, the DOE announced $325 million
in funding for
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/long-duration-energy-storage-demonstrations-projects-selections-award-negotiations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>15
long-duration demonstration projects</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
So while the market might not be quite ripe yet for funky, alternative
approaches to long-duration storage, support like this is going to be
necessary to ensure that these technologies are proven, cost-effective
and available as the grid decarbonizes and the need crystallizes.
</p>
<p>
“There is not currently a system-wide way of valuing long-duration
energy storage while competing against gas, but there are customers and
utilities that have shown a willingness, especially with federal and
state support, to invest in these technologies,” Goldie-Scot said. “That
I think is giving us the first real inkling of the role that the
long-duration can play in this market.”

<h2 id="how-to-converse-online">How to converse online</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The web is, at its core, a conversation tool. At least for the most part. You can have a conversation synchronously via chats and DMs, you can have a conversation semi-synchronously via posts on social media and forums, and you can have a conversation asynchronously using emails or blog posts. The vast majority of what’s happening on the web is a conversation of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Over the past few weeks, this topic of online conversations managed to
find its way over and over again in my brain. What’s the ideal workflow
for a good online conversation? I’m currently typing these words and I’m
talking to nobody. I don’t have an imaginary audience and I usually
assume that nobody will read these words even though I know for a fact
that some of you do. And yet, more often than not these posts I write
end up being excellent conversation starters. But what’s the best way to
have that conversation? I defaulted to email for pretty much all my
interactions even though some people do ping me via Apple Messages every
now and again. Is this arrangement ideal? Is email the best tool to have
these conversations? I honestly don’t know. I do know that so far I
haven’t found a better alternative.
</p>
<p>
Is this workflow ideal? I write something, you read it on the site, in
your RSS reader, or in your inbox, you send me an email, I reply to you
and off we go? Those are a lot of steps and there’s substantial friction
involved. You need to decide to send me an email, hunt for my email
address, write something, and overcome the weirdness of sending an email
to a stranger. It’s a lot. Wouldn’t it be a lot easier to leave a quick
comment? Shouldn’t I have comments on my site? Well, no. Comments are
easily one of the worst ways to have meaningful conversations online.
I’m not saying it’s impossible to have a smart, thoughtful conversation
in a comment section, I’m just saying it’s bloody hard. Comments are
performative. You write knowing the other people will see your comment
and so it’s not just a conversation between you and me. It’s a
conversation between you, me, and the countless other people who will
stumble on this page at any point in time.
</p>
<p>
When it comes to conversations, the location matters. It matters in the
real world and it matters in the digital world. Do you know how many
people have sent me awful, nasty emails in the past 7 years, since I
started this blog? Exactly zero. I’m aware that now that I said it
someone will do it just to be the first but still, my point stands.
Since an email is private people don’t usually bother because it takes
time and effort and there’s no reward at the end. They won’t get to see
my reaction, people won’t add a +1 to a like or a whatever to their
comment. The private space of an email conversation matters, it matters
a lot.
</p>
<p>
Another thing that matters is intentions. I recently removed from this
site the integration with webmention.io to receive webmentions from
other sites. Why? Well, because as much as I like and approve the idea
behind the concept of a webmention I also think that taking the time
matters. Taking 20 seconds to send an email to say “Hey, I wrote
something and I quoted something you wrote” has a lot more value in my
world than configuring a server to automatically send a ping towards my
server. I know most people won’t bother doing that and that’s fine. I
honestly prefer to not know, I prefer to not receive all those automated
pings and live in ignorance.
</p>
<p>
I obviously don’t have an answer to the question I’m asking in this
post. I don’t know what’s the best way to have a conversation online.
What I do know is that a good conversation takes time and effort. It
takes willingness to engage and it takes honesty. But they’re rewarding.
Good conversations are incredibly rewarding. I encourage you to try. Try
emailing the people behind the sites you read. Try to get in touch. See
what happens. Most won’t reply, and that’s fine. It happens. But some
will. And you never know what can happen.

id="trump-ally-bannon-must-report-to-prison-by-july-1-to-start-contempt-sentence-judge-says">Trump
ally Bannon must report to prison by July 1 to start contempt sentence,
judge says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former President Donald
Trump, must report to prison by July 1 to serve his four-month sentence
for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the
U.S. Capitol insurrection, a federal judge ruled Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington granted prosecutors’
request to make Bannon begin serving his prison term after a three-judge
panel of a federal appeals court last month upheld his contempt of
Congress conviction. But Nichols also made clear in his ruling that
Bannon could seek a stay of his order, which could delay his surrender
date.</p>
<p>Outside the courthouse, Bannon told reporters: “I’ve got great
lawyers, and we’re going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we
have to.”</p>
<p>Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, a Republican, had
initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction.
But the panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said all
of Bannon’s challenges lack merit.</p>
<p>Bannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress:
one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee
and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his
involvement in Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential
election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Bannon’s lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically
motivated and that the former adviser didn’t ignore the subpoena but was
still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional
committee when he was charged.</p>
<p>The defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his
attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because
the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon
could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because
Trump has asserted executive privilege.</p>
<p>Defense lawyer David Schoen told the judge the defense had planned to
ask the full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, if
necessary, to review the matter. Schoen said it would be unfair to send
Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his
sentence before those rulings could be handed down.</p>
<p>“That might serve a political agenda; but it would be a grave
injustice,” Schoen wrote in court papers.</p>
<p>A second Trump aide, trade advisor Peter Navarro, was also convicted
of contempt of Congress and reported to prison in March to serve his
four-month sentence.</p>
<p>Navarro had maintained that he couldn’t cooperate with the committee
because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected
that argument, finding Navarro couldn’t prove Trump had actually invoked
it.</p>
<p>The House Jan. 6 committee’s final report asserted that Trump
criminally engaged in a “multi-part conspiracy” to overturn the lawful
results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters
from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month
investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection two
years ago.</p>

<h2
id="foreign-policy-concerns-may-affect-us-presidential-election">Foreign
policy concerns may affect US presidential election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana — “It’s the economy, stupid,” is the
oft-repeated reminder from the 1992 U.S. presidential election,
attributed to political consultant James Carville explaining voter
motivations.</p>
<p>Economic concerns remain central to voters in this November’s
anticipated rematch between President Joe Biden and former President
Donald Trump, but wars in Gaza and Ukraine may influence enough voters
in swing states to make foreign policy matter on Election Day.</p>
<p>“This is projected to be a very close election decided by an
extremely small margin,” said Robert Collins, professor of Urban Studies
and Public Policy at Dillard University in New Orleans, Louisiana. “In
close elections, the people on those margins can determine who becomes
president.”</p>
<p>Massachusetts music teacher Lauri Sklar told VOA that this election
feels different from others, in part because the war in Gaza is such “a
watershed moment” for young Democrats.</p>
<p>“Whether they choose to support a third-party candidate or they
refuse to vote entirely, I think there are a lot of young liberal voters
who are not going to vote for Biden come November, and I’m worried that
might mean Trump wins,” Sklar says.</p>
<p>Young Americans focused on Gaza</p>
<p>A survey earlier this year by Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government
found that 18-to-29-year-old Americans overwhelmingly support a
permanent cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>Brooklyn Birdie, a graduate student from Shreveport, Louisiana says
she supported Biden in 2020 but will not in 2024.</p>
<p>“There is no way ‘Genocide Joe’ will receive a vote from me this
fall,” Birdie told VOA. “He is complicit with an ongoing ethnic
cleansing.”</p>
<p>That does not mean she will vote for Trump instead.</p>
<p>“I think, as a businessman, Trump’s presidency was good for the
economy,” she explained, “but I can’t support someone with such
unwavering support and allegiance toward Israel. I’m considering voting
for a third party, but I’m not sure yet.”</p>
<p>American priorities</p>
<p>America’s role abroad matters to New York teacher Paige Benson, but
it will not decide her vote.</p>
<p>“I value foreign policy, and I think our relationship with other
countries is really important,” she told VOA. “But that being said, we
have so much work to do with our own country.”</p>
<p>“When it comes down to who I will vote for, it’s going to be who I
trust with the economy,” she added. “It seems like everyone’s struggling
right now. I know people making six-figure salaries who are struggling.
Imagine how the rest of us are doing.”</p>
<p>Florida retiree Harvey Wasserman says he will be voting on
immigration.</p>
<p>“Foreign policy is important, but I wish we would stop being the
world’s judge and jury,” he said. “To me, let’s focus on home. I want to
see secured borders and clear citizenship requirements. I think Trump is
more likely to give us that.”</p>
<p>Decided on the margins</p>
<p>Connecticut voter Rebecca Urrutia says because “the way we handle
tensions with other countries will have a big impact for me,” she is
voting for Trump.</p>
<p>“I don’t like Trump’s style of communicating at all, but he’s much
stronger on foreign policy,” she added. “He’s direct and follows through
on what he promises. The Biden administration, on the other hand, are so
wishy-washy with their positions. There’s too much at stake to be
indecisive.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Foreign policy is also a top priority for Louisiana voter Debbie
Pesses, but she is voting for Biden.</p>
<p>“If Putin gets hold of Ukraine, none of Europe is safe,” she said.
“And as much as I feel for the people of Gaza, we can’t allow Hamas to
threaten the only true democracy in the Middle East.”</p>
<p>“We need someone calm in the White House,” Pesses continued, “and
even though I worry about Biden’s age, his temperament is much better
for the job than Trump.”</p>
<p>2024 election impact</p>
<p>In an election that could be decided by a handful of swing states,
Dillard University professor Collins says a motivating foreign policy
concern such as the war in Gaza could make the difference. In Georgia,
for example, Biden carried the state four years ago by fewer than 12,000
votes.</p>
<p>“There are more than 11,000 Muslim-Americans in Atlanta, alone,”
Collins said. “That could determine the next president, and it doesn’t
even account for the non-Muslim college students who are extremely
dissatisfied with how Biden has handled the conflict in Israel.”</p>
<p>“In the end, I think Muslim-Americans will conclude that Biden is the
lesser of two evils compared to Trump’s Middle East policy,” he
continued, “but I think a sizable number of younger Democratic voters
might be so disenchanted they’ll choose not to vote. The question is
will enough of them sit out to swing an election?”</p>

in Hunter Biden trial hear more from clerk who sold him gun at center of
case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WILMINGTON, Delaware — Jurors at Hunter Biden’s criminal trial heard
more Thursday from the former gun store clerk who sold him the
.38-caliber Colt revolver at the center of the case. </p>
<p>The clerk testified Wednesday that he watched as President Joe
Biden’s son checked off “no” to the question of whether he was “an
unlawful user of or addicted to” marijuana, stimulants, narcotics or any
other controlled substance. </p>
<p>Federal prosecutors have argued Hunter Biden was in the throes of a
heavy crack addiction when he bought the gun, and they’ve accused him of
lying on the form. He’s been charged with three felonies: lying to a
federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application
by saying he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11
days. </p>
<p>The Democratic president’s son arrived at court Thursday with a copy
of his memoir, “Beautiful Things,” tucked under his arm. The book,
written after he got sober in 2021, figures heavily into prosecutors’
case: They’ve played audio excerpts for jurors in which he details his
descent into drugs and alcohol following the death of his brother, Beau,
in 2015. </p>
<p>Hunter Biden, who has pleaded not guilty, has said the Justice
Department is bending to political pressure from Republicans and that
he’s being wrongly targeted. </p>
<p>Jurors have been shown as evidence Form 4473, the firearms
transaction record in question, and on Wednesday, they saw the gun that
was purchased. </p>
<p>Gordon Cleveland, the former clerk at StarQuest Shooters &amp;
Survival Supply, told jurors he walked Hunter Biden through a few
options before he settled on the $900 gun, and he watched Biden sign the
form, which includes a warning about the consequences of submitting
false information. </p>
<p>“Everything he bought, he ultimately decided on,” he told
jurors. </p>
<p>In his cross-examination Thursday, defense attorney Abbe Lowell
pointed out that some of the questions on the form are in the present
tense, such as “are you an unlawful user of or addicted to” drugs. He
has suggested Hunter Biden did not believe he had an active drug
problem. </p>
<p>Other questions are in the past tense, such as asking the potential
gun buyer whether he or she has ever been discharged from the military
or been adjudicated as a mental defective. </p>
<p>Much of the prosecution’s case so far has been dedicated to
highlighting the seriousness of his crack addiction and showcasing to
jurors bare-chested moments with ex-girlfriends, infidelity, crack pipes
— judgment lapses they believe prove he was actively using when he
checked off no. Prosecutors argue it’s necessary evidence to show his
state of mind when he bought the gun. </p>
<p>The proceedings are unfolding after the collapse of a plea deal that
would have resolved the gun charge and a separate tax case, and spared
the Biden family the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election.
First lady Jill Biden spent several days in court before joining
President Joe Biden in France for the D-Day anniversary. Allies worry
about the toll the proceedings will take on the president, who is deeply
concerned about the health and sustained sobriety of his only living
son. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hunter Biden’s friends and family are being called to
testify. </p>
<p>Kathleen Buhle, who was married to Hunter Biden for 20 years, told
jurors Wednesday that she discovered her husband was using drugs when
she found a crack pipe in an ashtray on their porch on July 3, 2015, a
day after their anniversary. When she confronted him, “he acknowledged
smoking crack,” she said. </p>
<p>Buhle testified that even before she found the drugs, she suspected
he was using. He had been kicked out of the Navy after testing positive
for cocaine. </p>
<p>“I was definitely worried, scared,” she said. They have three
children and divorced in 2016 after his infidelity and drug abuse became
too much, according to her memoir, “If We Break,” about the dissolution
of their marriage. </p>
<p>Buhle, who was subpoenaed, was on the stand for a brief 20 minutes.
She remained composed but seemed upset as she recounted how she searched
his car about a dozen times for drugs, whenever the children were
driving it. </p>
<p>“Did you ever see Hunter using drugs?” Lowell asked Buhle. </p>
<p>“No,” she replied. </p>
<p>Then prosecutor Leo Wise asked Buhle how she knew Hunter Biden was
using drugs. </p>
<p>“He told me,” she said. </p>
<p>Prosecutors also called Zoe Kestan, who testified under immunity
about meeting Hunter Biden in December 2017 at a strip club in New York
where she worked. During a private session, he pulled out a pipe and
began smoking what she assumed was crack. </p>
<p>“He was incredibly charming and charismatic and friendly, and I felt
really safe around him,” she said. “I remember after he had smoked it,
nothing had changed. He was the same charming person.” </p>
<p>Kestan detailed for jurors when she saw him use drugs, buy drugs,
talk about drugs or possess drug paraphernalia. Prosecutors asked her
where he stored his drugs and pipes, and she testified he kept them in
pouches and other places, such as sunglasses cases. </p>
<p>On cross-examination, Kestan acknowledged that she had no contact
with him in October 2018, the period when he bought the gun. </p>
<p>Prosecutors have also used his own words as evidence through his
memoir and text messages he sent to friends and family. The memoir
covers the period he bought the gun, though it doesn’t mention the
weapon specifically. </p>
<p>Lowell has said Hunter Biden’s state of mind was different when he
wrote the book than when he purchased the gun, when he didn’t believe he
had an addiction. And he’s suggested Hunter Biden might have felt he had
a drinking problem at the time, but not a drug problem. Alcohol abuse
doesn’t preclude a gun purchase. </p>
<p>If convicted, Hunter Biden faces up to 25 years in prison, though
first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it’s
unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars. </p>
<p>He’s also facing a separate trial in September on charges of failing
to pay $1.4 million in taxes. </p>
<p>In Congress, Republicans have for months pursued an impeachment
inquiry seeking to tie President Biden to his son’s business dealings.
So far, GOP lawmakers have failed to uncover evidence directly
implicating President Biden in any wrongdoing. But on Wednesday, House
Republicans accused Hunter Biden and the president’s brother James Biden
of making false statements to Congress as part of the inquiry. </p>
<p>The trial is unfolding shortly after Donald Trump, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New
York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity
underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024
campaign.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>As some of you will know, I recently started working on OSNews as my
full-time job, and that means I sometimes need to be annoying and remind
you all that I need your help in keeping the website going. Ad income
has been going down the drain for years and years now, so your support
is crucial in keeping OSNews online. We’ve been providing you with the
latest technology news for over 25 years now, and I’d really like to
keep things going for another 25 years. So, how can you help? You can
become an OSNews Patreon, which will remove ads from OSNews, and give
you a little bit of flair on every comment you post to show off that you
support us. We offer three pricing tiers with an increasing level of
prominence for your flair, with the highest tier giving you the option
of choosing your own flair to really show off to your fellow readers and
commenters that you are just a little bit more equal than everyone else.
You can also make individual donations through Ko-Fi. Since I really
need to replace the monitor of my OSNews workstation – after eight years
of loyal use, the cheap monitor is started to show ghosting and
flickering, and I feel like it could give out at any moment – I’ve set a
goal on Ko-Fi for this very purpose. I don’t expect this goal to be met
any time soon, but it’s a nice target to aim for and look forward to. I
intend to replace the old 4K display with the cheapest 4K/144Hz panel I
can find here in Sweden, but since that will most likely be unrealistic
price-wise, the goal is rooted more in aspiration than reality. There
are other ways to support us too – you can make a donation through
Liberapay, or go to our merch store and buy T-shirts, mugs, and other
cool items. The ultimate goal that I’m working towards is to eventually
be able to offer ad-free by default, fully supported by you, our
generous readers. This is a long-term goal and not something we’ll
achieve overnight, but I want to maintain OSNews’ independence at all
costs. Virtually every other technology news site you visit is part of a
major media empire, such as The Verge or Ars Technica, with huge amounts
of staff and massive funds backing them – and all the questionable
relationships between writers and the technology companies that entails.
Add to it the rise of artificial intelligence and the negative
consequences that’s going to have, and the need for independent,
reader-funded technology websites is greater than ever. That being said,
we will not be gating content behind paywalls, so even if you cannot or
are unwilling to support us, you will still get all the same content as
everyone else. As such, supporting OSNews financially is entirely
optional, and will not degrade your experience in any way. Still,
OSNews’ continued existence is entirely dependent on me being able to
generate enough income through it, so while you do not have to support
us, it’s definitely needed.</p>

<h2 id="biden-on-d-day-west-wont-abandon-ukraine-1">Biden on D-Day: West
won’t abandon Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, FRANCE — U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday met
with the rapidly dwindling number of American veterans of the Allies’
bold invasion of Normandy, where he marked the 80th anniversary of the
decisive World War II battle.</p>
<p>Biden, speaking just steps away from the American cemetery where
9,387 U.S. troops were laid to rest from the high-pitched battle to
loosen Nazi Germany’s grasp on France, said the past is ever
present.</p>
<p>He vowed the United States and NATO would not abandon support for
Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s two-year invasion.</p>
<p>“We will not walk away” from Ukraine’s defense and “surrender to
bullies,” he said.</p>
<p>He described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a “tyrant intent on
domination” and said democracy is now more at risk than at any other
point since World War II.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, we will not bow down, we cannot surrender to the
bullies, it is simply unthinkable. If we do, freedom will be subjugated,
all Europe will be threatened,” he said in offering wide support for the
global world order that emerged in the aftermath of World War II.</p>
<p>“To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators, is simply
unthinkable,” he said. “If we were to do that, it means we’d be
forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.”</p>
<p>D-Day was the largest amphibious assault in history, and Biden called
it a “powerful illustration of how alliances, real alliances, make us
stronger.”</p>
<p>He said that was “a lesson that I pray we Americans never
forget.”</p>
<p>Biden’s appearance came in the midst of his 2024 reelection campaign
for the presidency against Republican Donald Trump, who spoke at the
75th anniversary of D-Day five years ago.</p>
<p>Trump, who has often questioned the necessity of the U.S. commitment
to NATO, the West’s main military alliance, hailed the soldiers who
stormed the beaches of Normandy in his 2019 speech but did not praise
the global alliances that emerged after the war.</p>
<p>Trump has often attacked European members of NATO who do not spend
the equivalent of 2% of their national economic output on defense, a
NATO-suggested level for defense of their own countries.</p>
<p>Biden has cited his administration’s record of building global
alliances as a key accomplishment. He recently told Time magazine that
Trump “wanted to just abandon” U.S. allies and suggested the former
president would ultimately pull the country out of NATO if he were
elected again.</p>
<p>World leaders and luminaries – including actor Tom Hanks and director
Steven Spielberg – signaled their appreciation by attending Thursday’s
events.</p>
<p>But for ordinary French people – who also packed a beachside stadium
for a moving tribute to the actions of Allied soldiers – this is a
special day.</p>
<p>“U.S. engagement changed the fate of the continent at that time,”
Leonie Allard, a visiting fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Europe center
and a former French defense official, told VOA. “And probably projected
some of the lessons that we take from that engagement regarding the
challenges we’re facing today in Europe, with the return of war in the
continent due to Russia’s aggression of Ukraine.”</p>
<p>And French President Emmanuel Macron zeroed in on the heroism of men
who were, at the time, just out of boyhood.</p>
<p>“In the summer of 1944, you were barely 20 years old, maybe less,” he
said to the veterans before presenting 11 of them with his nation’s top
decoration, the Legion of Honor. “You had a family, friends, a fiancee,
a wife, sometimes children. You had dreams, plans, a future. And you
left everything, crossed the ocean and landed on the shores of France
eight decades ago. You left everything and took all the risks for our
independence, for our freedom. We will not forget this.”</p>
<p>Biden and first lady Jill Biden also personally greeted several dozen
World War II veterans who participated in the D-Day landings, including
many in wheelchairs and some who are more than 100 years old.</p>
<p>“You saved the world,” Biden told one man. He greeted each veteran
one by one, offering a salute or a handshake, and handing them a special
coin designed for the occasion.</p>
<p>“This is the honor of my life,” said a 102-year-old as he stood
between the Bidens for a photo.</p>
<p>“The honor of mine,” Biden replied.</p>
<p>And when Biden learned that another one of the veterans would be
turning 102 in a few days’ time, he turned to the gathered clutch of
American press and explained that, per Biden family tradition, a
rendition of “Happy Birthday” was in order.</p>
<p>“And the press, you’d better damn well join,” Biden said.</p>
<p>We sang.</p>

mega rocket completes its fourth test flight from Texas without

<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Boca Chica, Texas — SpaceX’s mega Starship rocket completed its first
full test flight Thursday, returning to Earth without exploding after
blasting off from Texas. </p>
<p>The previous three test flights ended in explosions of the rocket and
the spacecraft. This time, both managed to splash down in a controlled
fashion. </p>
<p>The world’s largest and most powerful rocket — almost 121 meters tall
— was empty as it soared above the Gulf of Mexico and headed east on a
flight to the Indian Ocean. </p>
<p>Minutes after Thursday morning’s liftoff, the first-stage booster
separated from the spacecraft and splashed into the gulf precisely as
planned, after firing its engines. </p>
<p>An hour later, live views showed parts of the spacecraft breaking
away during the intense heat of reentry, but it remained intact enough
to transmit data all the way to its targeted splashdown site in the
Indian Ocean. </p>
<p>“And we have splashdown!” SpaceX launch commentator Kate Tice
announced from Mission Control at company headquarters in
California. </p>
<p>It was a critical milestone in the company’s plan to eventually
return Starship’s Super Heavy booster to its launch site for reuse. </p>
<p>SpaceX came close to avoiding explosion in March, but lost contact
with the spacecraft as it careened out of space and blew up short of its
goal. The booster also ruptured in flight, a quarter-mile above the
gulf. </p>
<p>Last year’s two test flights ended in explosions shortly after
blasting off from the southern tip of Texas near the Mexican border. The
first one cratered the pad at Boca Chica Beach and hurled debris for
thousands of feet (meters). </p>
<p>SpaceX upgraded the software and made some rocket-flyback changes to
improve the odds. The Federal Aviation Administration signed off Tuesday
on this fourth demo, saying all safety requirements had been met. </p>
<p>Starship is designed to be fully reusable. That’s why SpaceX wants to
control the booster’s entry into the gulf and the spacecraft’s descent
into the Indian Ocean — it’s intended as practice for planned future
landings. Nothing is being recovered from Thursday’s flight. </p>
<p>NASA has ordered a pair of Starships for two moon-landing missions by
astronauts, on tap for later this decade. Each moon crew will rely on
NASA’s own rocket and capsule to leave Earth, but meet up with Starship
in lunar orbit for the ride down to the surface. </p>
<p>SpaceX already is selling tourist trips around the moon. The first
private lunar customer, a Japanese tycoon, pulled out of the trip with
his entourage last week, citing the oft-delayed schedule. </p>
<p>SpaceX’s founder and CEO has grander plans: Musk envisions fleets of
Starships launching people and the infrastructure necessary to build a
city on Mars.</p>

<h2 id="theyre-putting-ai-in-your-bios">They’re putting “AI” in your
BIOS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>You know what could really use a dose of “AI”? Your BIOS. aiBIOS
leverages an LLM to integrate AI capabilities into Insyde Software’s
flagship firmware solution, InsydeH2O® UEFI BIOS. It provides the
ability to interpret the PC user’s request, analyze their specific
hardware, and parse through the LLM’s extensive knowledge base of BIOS
and computer terminology to make the appropriate changes to the BIOS
Setup. This breakthrough technology helps address a major hurdle for PC
users that require or desire changes to their BIOS Setup for their
personal computers but do not fully understand the meaning of the
settings available to them. ↫ Insyde press release Google told users to
put glue on pizzas and eat rocks, so I’m sure the combined efforts of a
BIOS maker will surely not pose any problems when automatically changing
BIOS settings based on the requests of users who do not really
understand what they’re doing. This surely is a recipe for success, and
I can’t wait to tell my BIOS to enable XMP, only for it to disable
hyperthreading, change the boot order to only allow booting from the
non-existent floppy drive, and to force the use of the integrated GPU
when I’m actually using a dedicated one. This is going to be just
fine.</p>

id="windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned">Windows
Recall demands an extraordinary level of trust that Microsoft hasn’t
earned</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>The short version is this: In its current form, Recall takes
screenshots and uses OCR to grab the information on your screen; it then
writes the contents of windows plus records of different user
interactions in a locally stored SQLite database to track your activity.
Data is stored on a per-app basis, presumably to make it easier for
Microsoft’s app-exclusion feature to work. Beaumont says “several days”
of data amounted to a database around 90KB in size. In our usage,
screenshots taken by Recall on a PC with a 2560×1440 screen come in at
500KB or 600KB apiece (Recall saves screenshots at your PC’s native
resolution, minus the taskbar area). Recall works locally thanks to
Azure AI code that runs on your device, and it works without Internet
connectivity and without a Microsoft account. Data is encrypted at rest,
sort of, at least insofar as your entire drive is generally encrypted
when your PC is either signed into a Microsoft account or has Bitlocker
turned on. But in its current form, Beaumont says Recall has “gaps you
can drive a plane through” that make it trivially easy to grab and scan
through a user’s Recall database if you either (1) have local access to
the machine and can log into any account (not just the account of the
user whose database you’re trying to see), or (2) are using a PC
infected with some kind of info-stealer virus that can quickly transfer
the SQLite database to another system. ↫ Andrew Cunningham at Ars
Technica It really does seem Recall is kind of a mess in the security
department, and it has a certain rushed quality about it. All the
screenshots are saved in an AppData folder, and data pulled from those
screenshots is stored in a local SQLite database that happens to be
entirely unencrypted. TotalRecall, a tool developed by Alexander
Hagenah, will neatly pull the data from Recall for you without any
hassle or issues. This truly is a security nightmare. Aside from all the
obvious issues this presents, such as making it even easier for law
enforcement to gain access to pretty much everything you do online,
something especially troubling for minorities or in countries with
less-than-stellar police departments, Recall also presents a whole host
of other problems. Imagine being in an abusive relationship, and the
abusive partner demanding Recall be left on at all times to exert even
more control. Imagine an unscrupulous employee abusing Recall to steal
sensitive information from a company for a competitor. Imagine living in
some backwards part of a country with controlling religious parents, and
you happen to be gay. The problems here are endless. The fact you can
turn Recall off doesn’t mean much, since in the above examples, turning
it off is not an option since there are controlling people involved who
will demand you keep it on. Browser history and other forms of history
in your computer exist as well, of course, but they’re not always as
easy to parse, they’re easier to manipulate, sanitise, and temporarily
hide. Recall just combines all of this and puts a neat little bow on it,
ready to be abused by anyone with bad intentions. Recall is
ill-conceived, badly implemented, and a solution looking for a problem,
that in an of itself creates tons of other problems. I hope Microsoft
reconsiders, but in a world where “AI” makes investors go nuts, I doubt
we’ll see a sudden sense of clarity coming out of Redmond.</p>

pause”</a> the long-awaited NYC congestion pricing program that was set
to start on June 30. The policy would have charged drivers for entering
some of the city’s busiest areas, raising $1 billion annually for the
transit authority, cutting pollution, and easing traffic congestion. It
would have been the first such program in the nation. But, no more.
Hochul said it risked “too many unintended consequences.”

Environmental groups, state budget hawks, and transit advocates are
outraged by the u-turn. Her decision “will be a generational setback for
climate policy in the United States,”

an incensed Robinson Meyer for Heatmap</a>. “New York was bushwhacking a
trail for everyone else to follow: If congestion policy was a success
there, then other American cities could experiment with it in some form.
By pausing that trial before it has even begun, Hochul has essentially
frozen our ability to experiment with congestion pricing anywhere else
in the country.”

<span></span>2. IEA: Clean energy investment set to double fossil fuels

Global investment in clean energy is on track to reach $2 trillion in
2024, double the $1 trillion expected to be invested in fossil fuels,
according to the International Energy Agency. In its new

renewables surpassed the amount invested in fossil fuels last year for
the first time. Most of the money is going toward solar power. Here’s a
look at recent annual investment in solar PV (light blue) compared to

China accounts for the largest share of clean energy investment by a
long shot, and China, the U.S., and Europe make up more than two thirds
of the world’s clean energy investment. “More must be done to ensure
that investment reaches the places where it is needed most, in
particular the developing economies where access to affordable,
sustainable and secure energy is severely lacking today,” said IEA
Executive Director Fatih Birol. Even as clean energy funds are flowing,
spending on oil and gas is set to rise this year and remains far too
high to meet the world’s climate goals, the report said. Just 4% of oil
and gas companies’ 2023 investments went toward clean energy.

speech</a> at the American Museum of Natural History. The UN
secretary-general called the fossil fuel industry “the Godfathers of
climate chaos,” and said advertising and PR agencies that take Big Oil
on as clients are “enablers to planetary destruction.” He said the end
of the fossil fuel age was an economic inevitability, but that global
emissions need to fall 9% every year until 2030 to keep the goal of
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius alive. The next 18 months
will be key to deciding our future, he said. “I call on leaders in the
fossil fuel industry to understand that if you are not in the fast lane
to clean energy transformation, you are driving your business into a
dead end – and taking us all with you,” Guterres said.

80% chance that the global annual average temperature will exceed the

<p class="drop-caps">
The urgent need to build transmission infrastructure at dramatic pace,
scale, and geographic scope is clear. To decarbonize the power sector,
we’ll have to physically rebuild the grid once-over in the coming
decades to connect and facilitate a hopeful explosion in new renewable
generation capacity across our continental country. We will have to
accomplish this as electricity demand grows, including on account of
decarbonizing sectors such as buildings, transportation, and industrial
production through electrification. Given the stakes of grid balancing,
this task is akin to building and starting to operate a new beating
heart and wider cardiovascular system, all while keeping the old one
from failing amid surgery. Coordination and proactive planning of grid
buildout will be key.
</p>
<p>
Despite the undeniable public benefits, investment in the grid has been
stagnating, if not declining. A Department of Energy
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/national-transmission-needs-study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
found that annual net investment in the grid, as measured by new miles
of line, was actually negative on average between 2016 and 2020. Some
have faulted the National Environmental Policy Act for this
underinvestment, while others have blamed anti-social NIMBYs, both of
which, but especially combined, can thwart projects at the permitting
stage.
</p>
<p>
The reality is more complicated and implicates the basic governance of
the transmission system. The grid in the United States is owned,
operated, and planned largely by a highly fragmented set of privately
owned utilities and, in some places, their
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/electric-power-markets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nonprofit
associations</u></a>, which are regulated at the federal and state
level. Transmission owners do not propose and build transmission lines
unless they are profitable for their business, which is not guaranteed
most of the time. Indeed, new lines can cost transmission owners profits
by creating a larger pool of power supply and reducing the energy sales
and pricing power of their generation affiliates.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has repeatedly attempted to
prod utilities to do more by mandating regional planning procedures.
FERC announced its latest regulatory initiative, called
<a href="https://ferc.gov/news-events/news/fact-sheet-building-future-through-electric-regional-transmission-planning-and" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Order
1920</u></a>, last month, and it requires transmission owners to
undertake long-range regional planning that considers an array of public
benefits, including lower energy prices and enhanced system reliability.
In particular, the rule alleviates disputes over investment cost
allocation. But stronger planning procedures can hardly ensure that
private utilities will actually invest in needed lines. Indeed, FERC’s
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/OrderNo.890.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>serial</u></a>
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/electric-transmission/order-no-1000-transmission-planning-and-cost-allocation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attempts</u></a>
on this front have so far been a failure.
</p>
<p>
As this FERC activity suggests, the grid is already subject to great
public regulation, but this regulatory architecture still falls well
short of the public control necessary to treat the grid as a vital
common resource whose transformation must be proactively planned and
precisely delivered at the system-level. Through public planning and
development, we can overcome this structural fragmentation and
counteract private utilities’ low propensity to investment across the
transmission system. We need a centralized system of public planning,
funding, and construction of transmission facilities. We need to
nationalize the grid.
</p>
<p>
The benefits of grid expansion are manifold and go well beyond just the
functionality of decarbonization. More connections between states and
regions can lower the price of electricity and improve reliability,
which will become an increasingly pressing issue in the face of further
climate destabilization. And yet our transmission system consists of
regional and subregional grids “that operate like jealous petty
potentates, resisting stronger links that would allow renewable energy
to flow across regional boundaries,” in the words of the <em><em>New
York Times</em></em>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/04/opinion/nepa-permitting-reform.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>editorial
board</u></a>. Projects founder over disputes between utilities over how
to distribute costs, while other necessary new additions are never
proposed in the first place. This is a structural problem that leads to
quantitative underinvestment and qualitative poor coordination of
investment across the balkanized system.
</p>
<p>
The public pays for investments in the electricity system, whether
through taxes or consumer electricity bills in monopoly serviced systems
down the line. Public investment in critical infrastructure is cheaper
for the public than private investment due to the lower costs of debt
financing or direct access to the U.S. Treasury for public agencies.
These entities are also free from the imperative to maximize shareholder
returns and pay dividends. Public investment is more flexible and can
adopt a system-wide approach, as opposed to one blinkered at the level
of the project. Instead of piecemeal line extensions, the grid can be
expanded in a methodical and holistic fashion in accordance with social
need.
</p>
<p>
Public power is firmly established in the United States. Public agencies
such as the federal
<a href="https://www.tva.com/energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Tennessee
Valley Authority</u></a> and state-owned
<a href="https://www.nypa.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New
York Power Authority</u></a> generate and transmit power. In nearly the
entire contiguous United States west of the Mississippi River, three
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=11651" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>federal
power administrations</u></a> own transmission lines and
<a href="https://usc-cdn.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title16/chapter12B&edition=prelim" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>can</u></a>
<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/16421" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>construct</u></a>
new ones. Congress should set up and fund federal authorities across the
country to build the power grid we desperately need, coordinating with
each other and through federal level planning, and working with, and
when needed against, the current assemblage of private utilities.
</p>
<p>
The Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest offers a
good model of governance. It is led by a single administrator appointed
by the Secretary of Energy. This official has the broad authority to set
rates on wholesale power and transmission and develop the regional grid.
But these important decisions can only be made after
<a href="https://usc-cdn.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title16/chapter12H&edition=prelim" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>close
consultation</u></a> with retail and wholesale customers, Native
American tribes, elected officials, and environmental groups and are
reviewed by FERC. This system ensures efficient, publicly accountable
management of the grid.
</p>
<p>
Given the tight timeline we face to deliver on critical decarbonization
pillars, one might ask, why experiment with a publicly led approach? We
might stoke private utility backlash and weaken or slow the broader
project of cleaning up the power supply. But private utilities have had
decades to deliver a modern grid and failed. Because of the pressing
need to decarbonize and fortify resilience against entrenched climate
instability, the necessity of building state capacity is a sober
reality. We cannot begin to build necessary state capacity without first
acknowledging this necessity and acting in light of it.
</p>
<p>
North America’s power grid is called the
“<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262537407/the-grid/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">world’s
largest machine</a>” because it is a complex physical infrastructure
that must be in perfect balance every second. Our homes, places of work
and leisure, and increasingly vehicles are all plugged into the grid.
Preserving modern living standards—and an inhabitable planet—requires
expanding and rationally operating this common resource. This social
undertaking is too important to be entrusted to private corporations.

of World War II, Ukraine war fuse as Allies remember D-Day without
Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>UTAH BEACH, France — As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it will
rise again Thursday over the Normandy beaches where the waves long ago
washed away the blood and boot-steps of its soldiers, but where their
exploits that helped end Adolf Hitler’s tyranny are being remembered by
the next generations, seeing war again in Europe, in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Ever-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans who have pilgrimaged
back to France, and Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine that has
dashed hopes that lives and cities wouldn’t again be laid to waste in
Europe, are making the always poignant anniversaries of the June 6,
1944, Allied landings even more so 80 years on.</p>
<p>As now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades
buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s
presence at D-Day commemorations with world leaders — including U.S.
President Joe Biden — who are supporting his country’s fight against
Russia’s invasion will inevitably fuse together World War II’s awful
past with the fraught present on Thursday.</p>
<p>The break of dawn almost eight decades exactly after Allied troops
waded ashore under hails of gunfire on five code-named beaches — Utah,
Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword — will kick off a day of remembrance by
Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine — and with
World War II ally Russia not invited by host France. It cited Russia’s
“war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks”
for the snub.</p>
<p>With the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the
hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied
dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French
civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with
concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.</p>
<p>“There are things worth fighting for,” said World War II veteran
Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited
Omaha Beach this week. “Although I wish there was another way to do it
than to try to kill each other.”</p>
<p>“We’ll learn one of these days, but I won’t be around for that,” he
said.</p>
<p>Conscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will
soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of
aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists
soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th
anniversary.</p>
<p>The fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks
tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought
dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where
D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning
anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.</p>
<p>But at the 80th, they’re the VIPs of commemorations across the
Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured
Hitler’s defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall
11 months later.</p>
<p>Those who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the
millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other
vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat
exploits of men.</p>
<p>“We weren’t doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save
our country. And we ended up helping save the world,” said 98-year-old
Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29
bombers.</p>
<p>Feted wherever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes,
veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will
live eternal: Never forget.</p>
<p>“To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,”
98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific,
said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on
D-Day.</p>
<p>He quickly added: “I don’t know that amazing is the word.”</p>

id="democratic-contraception-access-bill-fails-in-us-senate">Democratic
contraception access bill fails in US Senate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A bill to safeguard access to contraceptives failed to
advance in a U.S. Senate vote on Wednesday, after congressional
Democrats forced the vote in a bid to focus public attention on
reproductive rights ahead of the November election. </p>
<p>The Right to Contraception Act, which would protect birth control
access nationwide, got 51 votes in support and 39 against, but fell
short of the chamber’s 60-vote threshold for advancing to a full
debate. </p>
<p>The fight over reproductive rights is a flashpoint in U.S. politics,
especially since the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v.
Wade, the decision that had recognized a national right to abortion
access.  </p>
<p>Last month, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump came under
fire after comments that political rivals said suggested he would
consider banning birth control, leading him to respond publicly that he
would not support such a move. </p>
<p>Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer on Wednesday pointed to several
states, including Nevada and Virginia, where Republican governors have
vetoed efforts to protect legal access to contraception, saying that
showed a need for federal legislation. </p>
<p>“We are kidding ourselves if we think the hard right will stop at
overturning Roe,” he said. </p>
<p>Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives said they would
attempt a legislative maneuver to force a vote on the same bill, though
they faced slim chance of success in the Republican-controlled
chamber. </p>
<p>“Republicans have a choice to make: They can put aside their MAGA
ideology and join us [to] get this bill passed, or they can triple down
on their anti-freedom extremism in full view of the American people,”
House Democrat Katherine Clark said on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Republican Representative Marc Molinaro, who won his district in 2022
by just 1.6%, said on Wednesday that he would cosponsor the legislation,
the first Republican to do so. </p>
<p>Some Senate Republicans criticized the push. </p>
<p>“It’s an election year in which a Democratic incumbent president is
running behind, so a decision has been made to raise abortion to a high
profile,” said Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, referring to President
Joe Biden. “You can’t normalize a procedure where the intent is to end a
life.” </p>
<p>In a May Reuters/Ipsos survey of 3,934 U.S. residents 18 and older,
37% said Biden has a better approach to abortion, compared to 27% who
said the same about Trump. </p>
<p>Schumer said Democrats would also vote on a bill next week to protect
in vitro fertilization, which Senate Republicans previously voted
against after an Alabama court made the fertility treatment used by
millions of Americans to conceive effectively illegal in the state.</p>
