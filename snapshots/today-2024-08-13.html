<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Elon Musk made news yesterday during his conversation with former
President Donald Trump, which live-streamed on X. In it, Musk advocated
for reducing federal government spending and reducing deficits as a way
of fighting inflation, and he angled for a role in the administration if
Trump wins. Plus, what would it take to see an emergency interest rate
cut? Then, A generally strong job market has led to economic
improvements for people without higher levels of education.

<h2 id="chrome-ios-browser-on-blink">Chrome iOS browser on Blink</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Earlier this year, under pressure from the European Union, Apple was
finally forced to open up iOS and allow alternative browser engines, at
least in the EU. Up until then, Apple only allowed its own WebKit engine
to run on iOS, meaning that even what seemed like third-party browsers –
Chrome, Firefox, and so on – were all just Safari skins, running Apple’s
WebKit underneath (with additional restrictions to make them perform
worse than Safari). Even with other browser engines now being allowed on
iOS in the EU, there’s still hurdles, as Apple requires browser makers
to maintain two different browsers, one for the EU, and another one for
the rest of the world. It seems the Chromium community is already
working on bringing the Chromium Blink browser engine to iOS, but
there’s still a lot of work to be done. A blog post by the open source
consultancy company Igalia digs into the details, since they are
contributing to the effort. While they’ve got the basics covered, it’s
far from completed or ready for release. We’ve briefly looked at the
current status of the project so far, but many functionalities still
need to be supported. For example, regarding UI features,
functionalities such as printing preview, download, text selection,
request desktop site, zoom text, translate, find in page, and touch
events are not yet implemented or are not functioning correctly.
Moreover, there are numerous failing or skipped tests in unit tests,
browser tests, and web tests. Ensuring that these tests are enabled and
passing the test should also be a key focus moving forward. ↫ Gyuyoung
Weblog I don’t use iOS, nor do I intend to any time soon, but the coming
availability of browser engines that compete with WebKit is going to be
great for the web. I’ve heard from so many web developers that Safari on
iOS is a bit of a nightmare to support, since without any competition on
iOS it often stagnates and lags behind in supporting features other
browsers already implemented. With WebKit on iOS facing competition,
that might change. Now, there’s a line of thought that all this will do
is make Chrome even more dominant, but I don’t think that’s going to be
an issue. Safari is still the default for most people, and changing
defaults is not something most people will do, especially not the
average iOS user. On top of that, this is only available in the EU, so I
honestly don’t think we have to worry about this any time soon, but
obviously, we do have to remain vigilant.</p>

The other challenge is just how many commands are available via
right-click, or keyboard+mouse action.

None of that is going to work, so everything must be rerouted to some

Last night at the New England Godot user group I did an impromptu talk
on bringing Godot to the iPad.
</p>
<p>
One topic that I went on for a while was how the smaller screen display
had forced me to either redesign or eliminate plenty of configurable
options in Godot.
</p>
<p>
For starters, almost every Editor tunable option had been removed. I
didn’t see any reason to keep them.
</p>
<p>
Someone did point out “40 inch displays are barely enough space for me”.
Made me wonder of the sanity of the effort :-)

Bermuda and possibly strengthening into a hurricane by Thursday.
Forecasters don’t think Ernesto will make landfall on the U.S. mainland
but said it could bring dangerous rip currents to the East Coast. This
is the fifth named storm of the 2024 season and comes just a little over
a week after Hurricane Debby struck Florida and swamped states along the
southeast for several days.

Heatmap polling</a> conducted in April found the top concern both
Democrats and Republicans have with renewable energy projects in their
areas is the harm those facilities could inflict on wildlife. Notably,
almost half of all Democrats said consequences for wildlife from
projects would elicit “strong concern” from them. Other big concerns for
Republicans such as reliability during extreme weather and land use
factors received nowhere near the same level of Democratic agreement.
The polling result underscores a real vulnerability that energy projects
labeled “clean” can face when a would-be host community is faced with
information indicating they may produce pollution or harm to the
environment,

There is a sliver of good news though: Last year’s estimated death toll
of 47,690 was lower than the 60,000 heat-related deaths recorded in
2022, and could have been 80% higher if it weren’t for our growing
knowledge of how to protect vulnerable populations, especially the
elderly. “We see that since 2000, the minimum mortality temperature –
the optimum temperature with the lowest mortality risk – has been
gradually warming on average over the continent, from 15ºC in 2000-2004
to 17.7ºC in 2015-2019,” said Elisa Gallo, researcher at ISGlobal and
lead author of the study. “This indicates that we are less vulnerable to
heat than we were at the beginning of the century, probably as a result
of general socio-economic progress, improvements in individual behavior,
and public health measures such as the heat prevention plans implemented
after the record-breaking summer of 2003.”

<p>
An analysis from The Economist looks at people who feel “left behind” in
America — those who got the short end of globalization and
deindustrialization, people who took the biggest hits in recent decades
from not having advanced education — and shows that that group has been
seeing economic improvement under the Trump and Biden administrations.
Plus, Harris and Trump look to nix federal taxes on tips, and consumers
expect inflation to become less of a problem.

id="millions-of-campaign-dollars-aimed-at-tilting-school-voucher-battle-are-flowing-into-state-races">Millions
of campaign dollars aimed at tilting school voucher battle are flowing
into state races</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Millions of dollars are being spent this year to
steer voters toward candidates for Republican-led Legislatures who not
only support school vouchers, but will become key figures in
implementing school choice programs in states across the U.S.</p>
<p>Most recently, national pro-voucher advocates declared victory after
spending more than $4.5 million in Tennessee’s primary election to
defend and elect legislative candidates they claim will support school
choice proposals in 2025 when state lawmakers are slated to return to
the Capitol to enact policy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at least $14.8 million was spent by similar advocacy
groups in the Texas primary election earlier in May to oust and replace
voucher opponents. In Idaho, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent
on candidates who both opposed and supported school vouchers in the
rural mountain-west state.</p>
<p>The spending spree is backed by the nation’s most high-profile
voucher influencers, including the School Freedom Fund, a pro-voucher
group tied to Club for Growth; the American Federation for Children,
which was founded by former Trump administration Education Secretary
Betsy DeVos; and Americans for Prosperity, the Koch family’s well-heeled
free-market group.</p>
<p>Their focus is often on primary elections because in
Republican-dominated states, primaries are seen as the most competitive
hurdle to getting elected.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake — if you call yourself a Republican and oppose
school freedom, you should expect to lose your next primary,” said David
McIntosh, president of the School Freedom Fund, said in a statement
shortly after Tennessee’s primary election. “As we continue to hear from
different governors, we plan on repeating our results from Tennessee and
Texas across the country. The school freedom revolution is just
beginning.”</p>
<p>Thirty-two states have implemented some sort of voucher program in
the U.S., and some have been in place for decades, often with strict
income requirements or narrowly tailored for students with
disabilities.</p>
<p>Yet, over the years, there’s been a noticeable push among Republican
leaders to make available taxpayer-funded vouchers, or scholarships that
can follow a child regardless of income to any public or private school.
About a dozen states now have such programs. But proposals are being
considered in many more, with varying degrees of legislative
support.</p>
<p>Idaho, Tennessee and Texas all weighed sweeping school voucher
proposals over the past year, but faced resistance not only from
Democrats — who don’t hold as much political power — but also Republican
members wary of directing public education dollars away from their
districts.</p>
<p>Tennessee’s Republican Gov. Bill Lee was forced to abandon his plans
for universal school choice earlier this year after divisions inside the
GOP-controlled Statehouse failed to come to a consensus on key
specifics.</p>
<p>The failure prompted Lee to break with his previous stance of
remaining quiet during GOP primary elections and instead publicly pick
favorites this year in a handful of legislative races.</p>
<p>Additionally, outside groups like Club for Growth, American
Federation for Children, Americans for Prosperity Action, and others
poured $4.5 million across 16 House and Senate legislative races. Three
of the open primaries saw almost a million dollars spent in each of the
races.</p>
<p>Club for Growth spent the majority of the money, pouring $3.6 million
across five races and ultimately winning four of those seats.</p>
<p>Lee didn’t endorse any opponents of a sitting Republican incumbent,
but he did throw support behind candidates in four open legislative
seats — three of which were successful.</p>
<p>The modest gains for Lee’s cause came at a big political cost.</p>
<p>After Lee endorsed Sen. Jon Lundberg, this year’s voucher bill
sponsor, former President Donald Trump backed Lundberg’s opponent, Bobby
Harshbarger, son of U.S. Rep. Diane Harshbarger. After Harshbarger was
declared the winner, Trump swiped at Lee on social media, calling him a
RINO, or “Republican in Name Only” even though he endorsed Lee in his
2022 reelection.</p>
<p>Lee has so far brushed aside the criticism, and instead released a
statement declaring that Republican primary voters “sent a clear
message: It’s time to deliver school choice for Tennessee families.”</p>
<p>Focusing solely on primary voters may be a winning strategy to
securing key state level races, but it comes at a cost of electing
candidates who may not represent the average voter, said John Geer, a
political science professor at Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p>“A very small proportion of the Tennessee voting public is driving
these outcomes, that’s not good for democracy,” he said.</p>
<p>In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also touted major wins for
voucher advocates in the aftermath of the state’s runoff primary
election in May.</p>
<p>Months prior, back in late 2023, a group of House Republicans joined
Democrats to help defeat a school voucher bill — delivering a blow to
one of Abbott’s top legislative priorities.</p>
<p>Similar to the playbook used in Tennessee, Abbott and national
voucher groups pivoted to ousting voucher opponents in the primary
election in order to secure a legislative victory in 2025.</p>
<p>Club for Growth ultimately took credit for removing 10 GOP incumbents
who had opposed Abbott’s voucher push after targeting 14 races in
primary and runoff election. Club for Growth reported spending $8.8
million and Abbott spent at least $6 million between the primary and
runoff elections.</p>
<p>“The Texas legislature now has enough votes to pass school choice,”
Abbott posted after the runoff election.</p>
<p>And in Idaho, four anti-school voucher Republican incumbents lost
their reelection bids after the American for Children PAC spent more
than $300,000 to promote school choice candidates.</p>
<p>During the 2022 election cycle, the organization spent $9 million on
state legislative races to support school choice friendly candidates but
CEO Tommy Schultz promised to spend “at least $10 million” this
year.</p>
<p>“To date, AFC and its affiliates have deployed more than $9 million
in state legislative primary elections across the country, and we will
spend millions more in the general election to advance school choice
policies for American families,” Schultz said in a statement to AP.</p>

<h2 id="indieweb-carnival-rituals">IndieWeb Carnival: Rituals</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Ritual, &lt;em&gt;a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, actions, or revered objects.&lt;/em&gt; Nothing in my life fits that definition.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
That’s it, that was my entry for this month’s IndieWeb Carnival on the
topic of Rituals. See you next month!
</p>
<p>
I’m just kidding. Well, I’m partly kidding. I’m serious when I say that
I don’t have anything that fits that definition in my life. I’d love to,
but I don’t. I’ve always been fascinated by rituals and strict routines.
And believe me when I say that I tried to implement them in my life many
many times before but always failed. I tried it with my meditation
routine, with my reading habits, and with my sleeping schedule. Nothing
sticks and introducing a ritual so far has been close to impossible. I
don’t know why. I’m just bad at living a structured life even though I’d
love to. But I think that’s mostly because I’m not really happy with the
life I’m currently living and settling into a routine is hard when you
know, deep down, that you want to change everything.
</p>
<p>
That said, rituals are awesome. There’s something deeply enjoyable in
seeing someone performing something in a very ritualistic way. Which is
why I always enjoyed things like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony">Japanese
tea ceremony</a>. This idea of doing something the same way over and
over again is very appealing to me. And who knows, maybe one day I’ll
manage to do the same myself.

<h2 id="serving-bare-git-on-the-web">2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the

<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-11-serving-bare-git-on-the-web">
2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web
</h1>
<p>
In the old days, I used <code>cgit</code> to render my git repositories
on the web. It’s simple to set up since it’s a CGI script. This is ideal
for URLs that get very few hits. When nobody is requesting the URL, the
CGI script isn’t running and no resources are being used. When a URL is
requested, however, the CGI script loads, the interpreter loads, the
libraries load, the script executes… It’s an expensive end-point! And
you know how it is. The web is full of leeches and bad bots, crawlers
and idiots. Having an expensive end-point means it needs protection.
</p>
<p>
For I while I thought that <code>legit</code> was the answer. It was
nice and fast and all that. But recently, <code>git clone</code> no
longer worked. It calls <code>git upload-pack</code> as an intermediate
workaround for
<a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/1062">#1062</a>. This
was failing for some reason, however. I tinkered with it for a while but
didn’t get anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Then I started thinking about
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a>’s post on
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos">hosting git
repos</a>. I made some changes to my Apache config and now <code>git
clone</code> works again.
</p>
<p>
The key is that you need a <code>post-update</code> hook that calls
<code>git update-server-info</code>. Each git repository already comes
with a <code>post-update.sample</code> hook containing the necessary
code, so I needed to loop over all the bare repositories I had and
rename the example hook.
</p>
<p>
Using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>for d in *.git
    sudo -u git mv $d/hooks/post-update.sample $d/hooks/post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
Sadly, this is not good enough.
</p>
<p>
In order to generate an <code>index.html</code> file for every
repository, I need a hook that regenerates it. If you know how to
determine whether regeneration can be skipped, I’d love to hear how to
that.
</p>
<p>
This hook also updates or adds the <code>AddDescription</code> lines I
need.
</p>
<p>
I prepared a hook that I wanted to install in every repository and saved
it as <code>~/post-update</code>.
</p>
<p>
This is what it looks like, using the Fish shell:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish

git update-server-info

# create index.html
set branch (git branch --show-current)
set template (cat /home/git/.readme.html | string collect)
set title (basename (pwd))
set body (git show $branch:README.md | cmark --to html | string collect)
printf &quot;$template&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &quot;$body&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &gt; index.html

# update description
set description (cat description)
sed --in-place=~ --expression &quot;/ $title/d&quot; /home/git/.htaccess
printf &quot;AddDescription \&quot;$description\&quot; $title\n&quot; &gt;&gt; /home/git/.htaccess
</code></pre>
<p>
(I need the title twice, once for the title and once for the reminder on
how to clone.)
</p>
<p>
I turn Markdown into HTML using <code>cmark</code>. Common Mark is the
closest we have to a standard, I guess.
</p>
<p>
The template <code>/home/git/.readme.html</code> looks like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;format-detection&quot; content=&quot;telephone=no&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
html { max-width: 70ch; padding: 1ch; margin: auto; }
body { hyphens: auto; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://src.alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
%s&lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/%s&lt;/mark&gt;
      &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
So now I needed to distribute the <code>post-update</code> hook to every
repository and run it once. I wrote yet another Fish script,
<code>~/recreate-index</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for d in /home/git/*.git
    echo $d
    cd $d
    cp ~/post-update hooks/
    chown git:git hooks/post-update
    chmod 775 hooks/post-update
    sudo -u git git hook run post-update
end
</code></pre>
<p>
I’m currently hosting 95 repositories according to <code>ls -d
/home/git/*.git | wc -l</code>. Some of these don’t have a
<code>README.md</code> file. Should I ever touch them again, I’ll have
to investigate.
</p>
<p>
Now, for the Apache web server – I changed my site to the following:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin alex@alexschroeder.ch
    ServerName src.alexschroeder.ch
    Include conf-enabled/blocklist.conf
    SSLEngine on
    DocumentRoot /home/git
   &lt;Directory /home/git&gt;
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>/home/git</code> directory has an <code>.htaccess</code> file
that starts out containing the following:
</p>
<pre><code>HeaderName .top.html
IndexOptions SuppressIcon SuppressSize FancyIndexing HTMLTable IgnoreCase
IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
IndexHeadInsert &quot;&lt;meta name=\&quot;viewport\&quot; content=\&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\&quot;&gt;&quot;
IndexOptions Charset=UTF-8
</code></pre>
<p>
The <code>.top.html</code> file contains a fragment to add to the top of
the index:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
body { max-width: 80ch }
table { overflow-x: auto }
td { padding: 0.5ex 1em 0 0; white-space: nowrap }
td:nth-child(3) { white-space: wrap }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hello!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm Alex Schroeder.
  These are my source code repositories. You can find out more about me on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. There, you'll also find a page
  listing ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As for the git repositories, you should be able to clone them as they are.
  For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/oddmu.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

<strong>2024-08-12</strong>. I wondered about links from the README to
local files. Right now, linking to images and files hosted in the same
repository doesn’t work since they don’t exist in the raw repository.
The question then becomes, as far as I am concerned, whether this README
is supposed to speak to developers or end-users? If it is for
developers, then pictures, screenshots, PDF files and all of that don’t
need to be linked from the repository. If you are interested in these
things, do a <code>git clone –depth 1</code> and investigate locally.
</p>
<p>
If the repository is for the end users, however, things are harder. The
<code>post-update</code> hook should extract all the local files linked
to from the README. Something like the following, perhaps:
</p>
<pre><code>for file in (printf &quot;%s\n&quot; $body | /home/oddmu/oddmu links - | egrep -v '^(https?:|mailto:|/)')
    set dir (dirname $file)
    if test ! -d $dir
        mkdir -p $dir
    end
    echo $file; sudo -u git git show $branch:$file &gt; $file
end
</code></pre>
<p>
This uses <a href="oddmu">oddmu</a> to extract the links from a Markdown
file, creates the necessary directories and checks out the files.
</p>
<p>
But if the files are no longer linked from the README, they are not
deleted. If a directory is linked from the README (I have done this!
🤦), the checkout won’t work.
</p>
<p>
I think the better way forward is to move this information elsewhere.
The README is not the documentation.
</p>
<p>
And with that, I think I did it! Serving git repositories from static
files. A single directory per project containing the bare git data and a
single <code>index.html</code> file. No more gazillion end points for
crawlers to lose themselves.

<h2 id="elon-musk-interview-of-trump-marred-by-technical-issues">Elon
Musk interview of Trump marred by technical issues</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s
interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk finally got underway
on Musk’s social media platform X on Monday evening, following a lengthy
delay caused by technical problems that kept many users from accessing
the live stream.</p>
<p>Musk, who has endorsed Trump, began the event at 8:42 p.m., more than
40 minutes after the scheduled start time. He blamed the difficulties on
a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which a server or network is
flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim was
not confirmed.</p>
<p>More than 1.3 million people were listening about 45 minutes into the
conversation, according to a counter on X.</p>
<p>Trump sought to turn the problems into a positive, congratulating
Musk on the number of people trying to tune in.</p>
<p>The former president sounded at times as if he had a lisp, many
listeners on X pointed out. Some said it made him sound like a cartoon
character, others suggested it could be due to audio compression
issues.</p>
<p>The technical issues recalled a similar event on X in May 2023, when
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suffered a chaotic start to his bid for
the Republican presidential nomination due to glitches on the
platform.</p>
<p>At the time, Trump mocked DeSantis on his own, social media platform,
Truth Social. “My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working
(TRUTH!)” Trump posted, “Yours does not.”</p>
<p>Ahead of Monday’s event, Musk had written: “Am going to do some
system scaling tests tonight &amp; tomorrow in advance of the
conversation.” X did not respond to requests for details or evidence of
the alleged cyberattack.</p>
<p>Musk spent much of the early part of the interview lauding Trump for
his bravery during the attempt on his life on July 13, when his ear was
struck by a bullet.</p>
<p>Musk, the world’s richest person, announced his support for Trump
shortly after the shooting. He backed Democratic President Joe Biden in
2020 but has tacked rightward since.</p>
<p>Trump said he plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of
the attack, for a rally in October.</p>
<p>As the conversation unfolded, Trump delivered his usual mix of
grievances, exaggerated claims and personal attacks, with Musk offering
occasional encouragement.</p>
<p>Trump claimed without evidence that Russia would not have invaded
Ukraine if he were still president and praised Russian President
Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un — all authoritarian strongmen — as at the “top of their
game.”</p>
<p>He also expressed anger that Vice President Kamala Harris had been
swapped in for Biden on the Democratic ticket.</p>
<p>“She hasn’t done an interview since this whole scam started,” Trump
said, claiming falsely that Biden dropping off the ticket was a “coup.”
Trump had been leading Biden in many polls of battleground states likely
to be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election but is now trailing
Harris in some of the same states.</p>
<p>In an interview that was light on policy detail, Trump also appeared
to praise Musk for firing workers.</p>
<p>“You’re the greatest cutter. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk
in, you just say: ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike — I won’t
mention the name of the company — but they go on strike. And you say:
‘That’s OK, you’re all gone.’”</p>
<p>Trump back on X</p>
<p>The interview provided an opportunity for Trump to seize the
limelight at a time when his campaign is facing new headwinds.</p>
<p>Harris has erased Trump’s lead in opinion polls and energized
Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies since she
replaced Biden as the party’s candidate three weeks ago. Her momentum
could get another boost from the Democratic National Convention next
week in Chicago.</p>
<p>Trump returned to X, formerly known as Twitter, with a series of
posts on Monday for the first time in a year, reviving an account that
had served as a main method of communication in previous campaigns and
his four years in the White House, including his followers’ Jan. 6,
2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>Trump’s access to his account, <span class="citation"
data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span>, was restored a
month into Musk’s ownership of X after being suspended by the platform’s
previous owners following the Jan. 6 attack, citing concerns he would
incite violence.</p>
<p>Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social platform, which was
launched in February 2022, but his posts there reach a much smaller
audience than on X.</p>
<p>Musk backs Trump</p>
<p>Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla, has echoed Trump’s false
claims about voter fraud and Biden’s immigration policies.</p>
<p>Musk has started an external super PAC spending group to support
Trump’s campaign. The political action committee is now under
investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws on
gathering voter information.</p>
<p>Trump, a longstanding critic of electric vehicles, shifted gears
after Musk’s endorsement.</p>
<p>“I’m for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very
strongly. So I have no choice,” Trump said at an early August rally.</p>
<p>United Auto Workers President Shawn Fein, campaigning in support of
Harris, called Trump a “sellout.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles
through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of
reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress, including Trump’s running mate Senator JD
Vance, have opposed those subsidies.</p>

nominating petitions despite living in California.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s lawyers quickly vowed to appeal ahead of the Aug. 15
deadline. If the judge’s ruling is upheld, it would not only keep
Kennedy off the ballot in New York but could also lead to challenges in
other states where he used an address in New York City’s suburbs to
gather signatures.</p>
<p>The ruling came after a North Carolina judge decided earlier Monday
that Kennedy can remain on that state’s ballot following a separate
challenge on different grounds.</p>
<p>Judge Christina Ryba, in her 34-page decision, said the rented
bedroom Kennedy claimed as his home in the state wasn’t a “bona fide and
legitimate residence, but merely a ‘sham’ address that he assumed for
the purpose of maintaining his voter registration” and furthering his
political candidacy.</p>
<p>“Given the size and appearance of the spare bedroom as shown in the
photographs admitted into evidence, the Court finds Kennedy’s testimony
that he may return to that bedroom to reside with his wife, family
members, multiple pets, and all of his personal belongings to be highly
improbable, if not preposterous,” the judge wrote.</p>
<p>Ryba said evidence submitted in trial showed Kennedy had a
“long-standing pattern” of borrowing addresses from friends and
relatives so he could maintain his voter registration in New York State
while actually residing in California.</p>
<p>“Using a friend’s address for political and voting purposes, while
barely stepping foot on the premises, does not equate to residency under
the Election Law,” the judge wrote. “To hold otherwise would establish a
dangerous precedent and open the door to the fraud and political
mischief that the Election Law residency rules were designed to
prevent.”</p>
<p>Clear Choice Action, the Democrat-aligned political action committee
that backed the legal challenge, said the ruling makes it clear that
Kennedy “lied about his residency and provided a false address on his
filing papers and candidate petitions in New York, intentionally
misleading election officials and betraying voters’ trust.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed on behalf of several voters in the state, claims
Kennedy’s state nominating petition falsely listed a residence in
well-to-do Katonah while actually living in the Los Angeles area since
2014, when he married “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actor Cheryl Hines.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who led a New York-based environmental group for decades and
whose namesake father was a New York senator, argued during the trial
that he has lifelong ties to New York and intends to move back.</p>
<p>During the trial, which ran for less than four days, Kennedy said he
currently rents a room in a friend’s home in Katonah, about 65
kilometers north of midtown Manhattan, though has only slept in that
room once due to his constant campaign travel.</p>
<p>The 70-year-old candidate testified that his move to California a
decade ago was so he could be with his wife, and that he always planned
to return to New York.</p>
<p>Barbara Moss, who rents the room to Kennedy, testified that he pays
her $500 a month. But she acknowledged there is no written lease and
that Kennedy’s first payment wasn’t made until after the New York Post
published a story casting doubt on Kennedy’s claim that he lived at that
address.</p>
<p>The judge also heard from a longtime friend of Kennedy’s who said the
candidate had regularly been an overnight guest at his own Westchester
home from 2014 through 2017, but was not a tenant there as Kennedy had
claimed.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing several New York voters grilled Kennedy in
often heated exchanges as they sought to make their case, pointing to
government documents including a federal statement of candidacy with a
California address, and even a social media video in which Kennedy talks
about training ravens at his Los Angeles home.</p>
<p>“Kennedy’s testimony that none of the furniture, bedding and other
decorative items in the spare bedroom belonged to him, as well as his
testimony that his wife and family, his extensive book collection, and
his wide assortment of domestic and exotic pets all remained in
California, was further compelling evidence that Kennedy lacks the
necessary physical presence and intent to remain” at the Katonah
address, the judge wrote in her ruling.</p>
<p>Kennedy has the potential to do better than any independent
presidential candidate in decades thanks to his famous name and a loyal
base. Both Democrat and Republican strategists have expressed concerns
that he could affect their candidate’s chances.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s campaign has said he has enough signatures to qualify in a
majority of states, but his ballot drive has faced challenges and
lawsuits in several.</p>
<p>Kennedy has told reporters that getting knocked off the ballot in New
York could lead to lawsuits in other states where his campaign listed
the same address.</p>
<p>After the trial ended Thursday, Kennedy argued that people who signed
his petitions deserve a chance to vote for him.</p>
<p>“Those Americans want to see me on the ballot. They want to have a
choice,” he said.</p>

investigating after Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. FBI said on Monday it was investigating after
Donald Trump’s presidential campaign said its internal communications
were hacked and the campaign blamed the Iranian government.</p>
<p>The former president said on Saturday that Microsoft had informed his
campaign that Iran had hacked one of its websites. Trump said Iran was
“only able to get publicly available information.”</p>
<p>The FBI is also investigating an alleged hack targeting advisers to
the campaign of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris,
The Washington Post reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The FBI began the investigation in June, when Biden was still running
for president, suspecting that Iran was behind the attempts to steal
data from two U.S. presidential campaigns, the newspaper said, citing
sources.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for
comment. Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee after Biden
withdrew his bid last month.</p>
<p>The Iranian government has denied that it hacked the Trump
campaign.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign has pointed to a report on Friday by Microsoft
researchers that indicated that Iranian government-linked hackers tried
breaking into the account of a “high-ranking official” on a U.S.
presidential campaign in June.</p>
<p>The report added that the hackers took over an account belonging to a
former political adviser and then used it to target the official. It did
not provide further details on the targets’ identities.</p>

id="site-of-deadliest-church-shooting-in-us-history-is-torn-down-over-protests">Site
of deadliest church shooting in US history is torn down over
protests</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>sutherland springs, texas — Crews on Monday tore down a Texas church
where a gunman killed more than two dozen worshippers in 2017, using
heavy machinery to raze the small building even after some families
sought to preserve the scene of the deadliest church shooting in U.S.
history.</p>
<p>A judge cleared the way last month for the First Baptist Church of
Sutherland Springs to tear down the sanctuary where the attack took
place, which until now had been kept as a memorial. Church members voted
in 2021 to tear it down, but some families in the community of less than
1,000 people filed a lawsuit hoping for a new vote on the building’s
fate.</p>
<p>Authorities put the number of dead in the November 5, 2017, shooting
at 26 people, including a pregnant woman and her unborn baby. After the
shooting, the interior of the sanctuary was painted white and chairs
with the names of those who were killed were placed there. A new church
was completed for the congregation about a year and a half after the
shooting.</p>
<p>John Riley, an 86-year-old member of the church, watched with sadness
and disappointment as the long arm of a yellow excavator swung a heavy
claw into the building over and over.</p>
<p>“The devil got his way,” Riley said, “I would not be the man I am
without that church.”</p>
<p>He said he would pray for God to “punish the ones” who put the
demolition in motion.</p>
<p>“That was God’s house, not their house,” Riley said.</p>
<p>For many in the community, the sanctuary was a place of solace.</p>
<p>Terrie Smith, president of the Sutherland Springs Community
Association, visited often over the years, calling it a place where “you
feel the comfort of everybody that was lost there.” Among those killed
in the shooting were a woman who was like a daughter to Smith — Joann
Ward — and Ward’s two daughters, ages 7 and 5.</p>
<p>Smith watched Monday as the memorial sanctuary was torn down.</p>
<p>“I am sad, angry, hurt,” she said.</p>
<p>In early July, a Texas judge granted a temporary restraining order
sought by some families. But another judge later denied a request to
extend that order, setting in motion the demolition. In court filings,
attorneys for the church called the structure a “constant and very
painful reminder.”</p>
<p>Attorneys for the church argued that it was within its rights to
demolish the memorial while the attorney for the families who filed the
lawsuit said they were just hoping to get a new vote.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that some church members were
wrongfully removed from the church roster before the vote was taken. In
a court filing, the church denied the allegations in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>A woman who answered the phone at the church said Monday that she had
no comment then hung up.</p>
<p>The man who opened fire in the church, Devin Patrick Kelley, died of
a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was chased by bystanders and
crashed his car. Investigators have said the shooting appeared to stem
from a domestic dispute involving Kelley and his mother-in-law, who
sometimes attended services at the church but was not present on the day
of the shooting.</p>
<p>Communities across the U.S. have grappled with what should happen to
the sites of mass shootings. Last month, demolition began on the
three-story building where 17 people died in the 2018 mass shooting at
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. After the
2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, it was
torn down and replaced.</p>
<p>Tops Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New York, and the Emanuel African
Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where racist
mass shootings happened, both reopened. In Colorado, Columbine High
School still stands, though its library, where most of the victims were
killed, was replaced.</p>
<p>In Texas, officials closed Robb Elementary in Uvalde after the 2022
shooting there and plan to demolish the school.</p>

<h2 id="earth-hit-by-severe-solar-storm">Earth hit by ‘severe’ solar
storm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Earth was hit Monday by an intense solar storm that
could bring the Northern Lights to night skies farther south than
normal, a U.S. agency announced. </p>
<p>Conditions of a level-four geomagnetic storm — on a scale of five —
were observed Monday from 1500 GMT, according to a specialized center at
the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). </p>
<p>These conditions may persist for several hours but were not expected
to increase further in intensity, NOAA added in a statement. </p>
<p>“A severe geomagnetic storm includes the potential for aurora to be
seen faintly as far south as Alabama and northern California,” NOAA said
in a statement, referring to the two U.S. states. </p>
<p>The new solar storm is caused by coronal mass ejections, which are
explosions of particles leaving the sun. When these particles arrive on
Earth, they disrupt the planet’s magnetic field. </p>
<p>“There are a lot of auroras now. … If it lasts until nightfall here,
we might be able to see some,” Eric Lagadec, an astrophysicist at the
Cote d’Azur Observatory in France, said on X, formerly Twitter.  </p>
<p>On Sunday, NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick published on X a superb
photo of the aurora borealis — or Northern Lights — taken from the
International Space Station, where he is currently stationed. </p>
<p>But solar or geomagnetic storms can also trigger undesirable effects.
 </p>
<p>For example, they can degrade high-frequency communications, disrupt
satellites and cause overloads on the electricity grid. Operators of
sensitive infrastructure have been notified to put in place measures to
limit these effects, NOAA said. </p>
<p>In May, the planet went through the most powerful geomagnetic storms
recorded in 20 years. They caused auroras to light up the night sky in
the United States, Europe and Australia, at much lower latitudes than
usual. </p>
<p>This type of event has increased recently because the sun is
currently close to its peak activity, as per its 11-year cycle.</p>

id="pacific-northwest-tribes-battered-by-climate-change-but-fight-to-get-money-meant-to-help-them">Pacific
Northwest tribes battered by climate change but fight to get money meant
to help them</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SEATTLE — Coastal tribes in the Pacific Northwest experience some of
the most severe effects of climate change — from rising seas to severe
heat — but face an array of bureaucratic barriers to access government
funds meant to help them adapt, a report released Monday found.</p>
<p>The tribes are leaders in combating climate change in their region.
But a report by the Northwest Climate Resilience Collaborative says as
tribes seek money for specific projects to address climate change
repercussions, such as relocating a village threatened by rising waters,
they often can’t provide the matching funds that many grants require or
the necessary staff or struggle with stringent application requirements.
If they do get funding, it’s often a small amount that can only be used
for very specific projects when this work is typically much more
holistic, the report found.</p>
<p>“Trying to do projects by piecing together grants that all have
different requirements and different strings attached, without staff
capacity is a challenge,” Robert Knapp, environmental planning manager
at the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe in northwest Washington, said in the
report.</p>
<p>The collaborative, funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, spent two years holding listening sessions with 13
tribes along the Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington, the Strait of
Juan de Fuca and the Puget Sound. The communities face significant
challenges from coastal flooding and erosion, rising stream
temperatures, declining snowpack, severe heat events and increasing
wildfire risk.</p>
<p>In addition to funding challenges, those interviewed also described
not having enough staff to adequately respond to climate change as well
as sometimes not being able to partner with state and local governments
and universities in this work because of their remote locations. They
also said it can be hard to explain to people who don’t live in their
communities about the impact climate change has on the tribes.</p>
<p>But as they work to restore salmon habitats affected by warming
waters or move their homes, funding gaps and complications were key
concerns.</p>
<p>A representative from one anonymous tribe in the report said it was
not able to hire a grant writer and had to rely on its biology
department to navigate the maze of funding applications. Another talked
about depending on 15 separate funders just to build a marina.</p>
<p>“This is a time of historic state and federal investment in climate
action, and tribal priorities really need to be considered when making
decisions around how we’re going to be directing this investment,” said
Meade Krosby, senior author of the report.</p>
<p>“Hopefully this will help to inform how this work is being done, how
these funds are being directed, so that they are actually responsive to
the barriers that tribes are facing and helping to remove some of those
barriers so the tribes can get the good work done.”</p>
<p>The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not immediately respond to an email
requesting comment.</p>
<p>Most of the tribes included in the report had completed publicly
available reports on the impacts of climate change, and some had
developed detailed plans for relocation as rising waters threaten
buildings, or even entire villages.</p>
<p>The Quinault Indian Nation, in Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, has a
plan for relocating its largest village. The multimillion-dollar effort
has relied on a piecemeal of federal and state grants and the
constraints that come with them, Gary Morishima, Quinault’s natural
resources technical adviser, explained in the report.</p>
<p>Other tribes brought up concerns about competing against other tribal
nations for funding when collaboration is such a vital part of
responding to climate change. Tribal lands share borders and coastlines,
and the impacts of climate change on those lands do not stop at any
border, the report pointed out.</p>
<p>Amelia Marchand, citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville
Reservation and another author of the report, explained that it comes
down to the federal government fulfilling its trust responsibility to
tribes.</p>
<p>“The treaty is supposed to support and uplift and ensure that what
the tribes need for continued existence is maintained,” she said. “And
that’s one of the issues with not having this coordinated federal
response because different federal agencies are doing different
things.”</p>
<p>Millions of dollars have gone to coastal tribes, and the report said
much more is needed. It referenced a 2020 Bureau of Indian Affairs
report that estimated that tribes in the lower 48 states would need $1.9
billion over the next half-century for infrastructure needs related to
climate change.</p>
<p>Amid all the challenges, Pacific Northwest tribes are still leaders
in climate adaptation and have plenty to teach other communities,
Marchand said.</p>
<p>“Finding ways to make their progress happen for their nations and
their communities despite those odds is one of the most inspiring and
hopeful resilient stories,” she said.</p>

id="apple-forces-patreon-to-charge-patreons-30-tax-or-have-its-ios-application-banned-from-the-app-store">Apple
forces Patreon to charge Patreons 30% tax, or have its iOS application
banned from the App Store</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>I have no contracts, agreements, or business with Apple, I do not use
any Apple products, I do not rely on any Apple services, and none of my
work requires the use of any of Apple’s tools. Yet, I’m forced to deal
with Apple’s 30% tax. Today, Patreon, which quite a few of you use to
support OSNews, announced that Apple is forcing them to change its
billing system, or risk being banned from the App Store. This has some
serious consequences for people who use Patreon’s iOS application to
subscribe to Patreons, and for the creators you subscribe to. First:
Apple will be applying their 30% App Store fee to all new memberships
purchased in the Patreon iOS app, in addition to anything bought in your
Patreon shop. ↫ Patreon’s website First things first: the 30% mafia tax
will only be applied to new Patreons subscribers using the Patreon iOS
application to subscribe, starting early November 2024. Existing
Patreons will not be affected, iOS or no. Anyone who subscribes through
the Patreon website or Android application will not be affected either.
Since creators like myself obviously have no intention of just handing
over 30% of what our iOS-using supporters donate to us, Patreon has
added an option to automatically increase the prices of subscriptions
inside the Patreon iOS application by 30%. In other words, starting this
November, subscribing to the OSNews Patreon through the iOS application
will be 30% more expensive than subscribing from anywhere else. As such,
I’m pondering updating the description of our Patreon to strongly
suggest anyone wishing to subscribe to the OSNews Patreon to do so
either on the web, or through the Patreon Android application instead.
If you’re hell-bent on subscribing through the Patreon iOS application,
you’ll be charged an additional 30% to pay protection money to Apple.
And just to reiterate once more: if you’re already a Patreon, nothing
will change and you’ll continue to pay the regular amounts per tier.
Second: Any creator currently on first-of-the-month or per-creation
billing plans will have to switch over to subscription billing to
continue earning in the iOS app, because that’s the only billing type
Apple’s in-app purchase system supports. ↫ Patreon’s website This is
Patreon inside baseball, but as it stands right now, subscribers to the
OSNews Patreon are billed on the first of the month, regardless of when
during a month you subscribe. This is intentional, since I really like
the clarity it provides to subscribers, and the monthly paycheck it
results in for myself. Sadly, Apple is forcing Patreon to force me to
change this – I am now forced to switch to subscription billing instead,
somewhere before November 2025. This means that once I make that forced
switch, new Patreons will be billed on their subscription date every
month (if you subscribe on 25 April, you’ll be charged every 25th of the
month). Luckily, nothing will change for existing subscribers – you will
still be billed on the 1st of the month. This whole thing is absolutely
batshit insane. Not only is Patreon being forced by Apple to do this at
the risk of having their iOS application banned from the App Store,
Apple is also making it explicitly impossible for Patreon to go any
other route. As we all know, Patreon won’t be allowed to advertise that
subscribing will be cheaper on the web, but Apple is also not allowing
Patreon to remove subscribing in the Patreon iOS application altogether
– if Patreon were to do that, Apple will ban the application from the
App Store as well. And with how many people use iOS, just outright
deprecating the Patreon iOS application is most likely going to hurt a
lot of creators, especially ones outside of the tech sphere. Steven
Troughton-Smith did some math, and concluded that Apple will be making
six times as much from donations to Patreon creators than Patreon itself
will. In other words, if you use iOS, and subscribe to a creator from
within the Patreon iOS application, you will be supporting Apple – a
three trillion dollar corporation – more than the most likely small
creator you want to encourage to keep making content, art, or whatever.
That is absolutely, balls-to-the-wall, batshit insanity. Remember that
ad Apple made where it crushed a bunch of priceless instruments and art
supplies into an iPad – the ad it had to pull and apologise for because
creators, artists, writers, and so on thought it was tasteless and
dystopian? Who knew that ad was literal.</p>

<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Haiku, the platform grossing in ported browsers while its native
WebPositive browser languishes, has added another notch to its belt –
and this time, it’s a big one. Firefox has been tentatively ported to
Haiku, but it’s early days and there’s no package ready to download –
you’ll have to compile it yourself if you want to get it running. It’s
version 128, so it’s the latest version, too. Without the ability to
easily test and run it, there’s not much more to add at this point, but
it’s still a major achievement. I hope there’ll be a nice Haiku package
soon.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-deprecates-paint-3d">Microsoft deprecates Paint
3D</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Way back in the early before time, Microsoft thought it would be a
good idea to brand Windows 10 entirely around the label “creators”, and
one distinctly odd consequence of that was an application called “Paint
3D”, a replacement for the traditional Paint application that Microsoft
had been shipping one way or another since 1985, when it included a
simple bitmap editing program called “Doodle” with its mouse drivers for
DOS. Doodle would be replaced shortly after by a whitelabel version of
ZSoft Corporation’s PC Paintbrush, and once Windows 1.0 rolled around,
it was rebranded as Paint, a name that has stuck until today. Paint 3D
was supposed to replace the regular Paint, with a focus on creating and
manipulating 3D objects, serving as an extension to Microsoft’s failed
efforts to bring VR and AR to the masses. Microsoft even went so far as
to list the regular Paint as deprecated, but after a lot of outcry, has
since reneged and refocused its efforts on improving it. Paint 3D,
however, is not officially going to be deprecated, and has been added to
Microsoft’s list of deprecated Windows features. Paint 3D is deprecated
and will be removed from the Microsoft Store on November 4, 2024. To
view and edit 2D images, you can use Paint or Photos. For viewing 3D
content, you can use 3D Viewer. ↫ Microsoft’s list of deprecated Windows
features I don’t think anyone is going to shed a tear on this, but at
the same time, as with everything Microsoft changes or removes from
Windows, there’s bound to be at least a few people whose entire workflow
heavily depends on Paint 3D, and they’re going to be pissed.</p>

Top Concern About Renewable Energy Projects</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Renewable energy’s biggest political liability? It may be the whales and
tortoises, according to Heatmap polling.
</p>
<p>
Conflicts over the environmental impacts of energy transition
technologies — some rooted in fact, others founded more in fear — have
played out in myriad ways across America over the past few years, from
residents of beach towns protesting against offshore wind in the name of
whale safety to farm communities opposing solar and onshore wind over
impacts to livestock and birds. While some of these fights have been
seeded by anti-renewable interest groups, these outside actors have
fertile soil to work with. Exclusive Heatmap polling conducted in April
found the top concern both Democrats and Republicans have with renewable
energy projects in their areas is the harm those facilities could
inflict on wildlife.
</p>
<p>
Notably, almost half of all Democrats said consequences for wildlife
from projects would elicit “strong concern” from them. Other big
concerns for Republicans such as reliability during extreme weather and
land use factors received nowhere near the same level of Democratic
agreement.
</p>
<p>
It’s hard to say whether this is because people are really concerned
about animals and species protection generally or because there’s a
concerted public relations effort (funded in no small part by
<a href="https://energyandpolicy.org/fossil-fuel-funding-anti-offshore-wind-ads/" target="_blank">fossil
fuel companies</a>) to focus on the negative environmental effects of
solar farms and wind turbines. But nevertheless, this polling result —
which is being reported today for the first time — underscores a real
vulnerability that energy projects labeled “clean” can face when a
would-be host community is faced with information indicating they may
produce pollution or harm to the environment.
</p>
<p>
It also helps explain a recent statewide poll of New Jersey residents
conducted by researchers at Stockton University that found a sharp
increase in the percentage of respondents opposed to offshore wind
following a very public campaign to tie new offshore project development
to a spate of whale deaths.
</p>
<p>
“These conflicts are real, I’m not going to say they aren’t. That’s why
I say there are appropriate places to site and inappropriate places to
site,” Matt Kirby, senior director of energy and landscape conservation
for the National Parks Conservation Association, told me. “I hope that
industry understands that it needs to have social license to operate,
and it will only be able to get that if they’re a good player.”
</p>
<h3>
The Jersey campaign
</h3>
<p>
How this played out in New Jersey should be cause for concern to anyone
trying to deploy more renewable energy.
</p>
<p>
In 2019, researchers at Stockton, a public university in the state,
found broad bipartisan support for offshore wind development. Then came
at least a dozen
<a href="https://abc7ny.com/climate-change-dead-whale-beached-tri-state-area/12901186/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dead
whales</u></a> that washed onto the Atlantic coastline, an incident that
lacks a known cause to this day … but also spurred a
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/19/whales-offshore-wind-farms-00100396" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>non-stop
anti-offshore wind campaign</u></a> driven
<a href="https://www.thefisherman.com/article/rep-van-drew-launches-congressional-investigation-into-offshore-wind-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
politicians</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-rapidly-escalating-its-anti-offshore-wind-campaign" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>political
media figures</u></a>, including those with ties to
<a href="https://grist.org/politics/republicans-fossil-fuels-the-gop-donors-behind-a-growing-misinformation-campaign-to-stop-offshore-wind/" target="_blank">fossil
fuel-funded opposition groups</a>.
</p>
<p>
There’s been no evidence to date that the offshore wind build-out off
the Atlantic coast has harmed a single whale. But studies have shown
that
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-13/wind-farm-impacts-on-whale-habitat-is-still-a-mystery-scientists-say" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>activities</u></a>
related to offshore wind <em><em>could
</em></em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-29/endangered-whales-at-risk-from-offshore-wind-us-scientist-warns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>harm
a whale</u></a>, which appears to be enough to override the benefits for
some people. When Stockton pollsters
<a href="https://stockton.edu/news/2023/windmill-support-drops-hughes-poll.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>checked
again</u></a> in September 2023 to measure support for offshore wind,
they found it had plummeted. More state residents supported wind farms
than opposed them, still. But support had dropped 30%, to roughly half
of all participants backing the projects. Only a third of those living
on the coasts were for constructing new offshore wind.
</p>
<p>
Alyssa Maurice, one of the researchers involved in the recent poll, told
me there’s multiple ways to read this data, including that it may have
been driven by partisanship. The whale campaign had a lot of play
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-approves-massive-wind-farm-amid-rising-whale-death-toll" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on
Fox News</u></a> (and
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservative-groups-cleared-continue-legal-fight-protect-whales-biden-backed-offshore-wind-farm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>still
does today</u></a>). But there’s a very real chance the campaign to tie
the whale deaths and other potential environmental harms to offshore
wind worked: Nearly 44% of respondents said they believed offshore wind
would impact marine life “a great deal,” a figure that rose to 62% when
it came to people on the coast.
</p>
<p>
“There’s now this gap between shore communities and the state that
wasn’t there before,” Maurice said. “[It’s] a really stark geographic
divide.”

<p>
Climate change is a
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-moving-endangered-species-188dc7a881cef6766d63f20bfabefdfb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major
risk</u></a> to wildlife habitat and imperiled species across the world
— that much is plain as day. There’s a reason the survival of certain
<a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/the-polar-bear-more-than-a-poster-child/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mammals</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/no-more-delta-smelt-the-delta-tunnel-project-threatens-their-extinction-for-good/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fish</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.nwf.org/Garden-for-Wildlife/About/Native-Plants/keystone-plants-by-ecoregion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fauna</u></a>
often described as “keystone species” are seen as bellwethers for
planetary warming. When they go extinct from climate impacts to river
temperatures or food availability, it portends harms that may befall
other species too — including, maybe, humans.
</p>
<p>
But an unfortunate truth is that major industrial projects — even ones
aimed at decarbonizing the global economy — will always impact the local
environment. To build
<a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/03/21/solar-power-project-threatens-prime-desert-tortoise-habitat-conservationists-warn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>large-scale
solar farms</u></a> or
<a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/howardcenter/lithium/stories/lithium-liabilities.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lithium
mines</u></a> or sprawling CO2 pipelines, we may need to disrupt a
substantial number of endangered species and their habitat, not to
mention the livelihoods of countless people who make their livelihoods
off the land, air, and sea, or who enjoy outdoor recreation and hunting.
</p>
<p>
These conflicts are the reason
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18042024/inside-clean-energy-transition-terminology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>I
gave</u></a> a talk at the Society of Environmental Journalists’
conference this year explaining why I do not use the term “clean energy”
without quotation marks — not for the derisive reasons climate deniers
put scarequotes around the term, but in pursuit of accuracy and out of
respect for the populations most impacted by new projects. Before I
joined Heatmap, I spent years
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-much-mining-is-needed-to-save-the-planet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writing
about</u></a> mining for
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/lack-of-graphite-could-gum-up-american-ev-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>battery
metals</u></a>, and I heard countless complaints from individuals in
frontline communities and human rights groups about how there’s nothing
“clean” about a car made with cobalt
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/cobalt-poses-human-rights-test-for-biden-on-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mined
by a child</u></a> or lithium chemicals that sapped
<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/facing-water-stress-chiles-lithium-industry-under-scrutiny-in-atacama-desert/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
aquifer dry</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say focusing on the “clean” part of decarbonization is a
bad thing — it’s just not what brings people together, according to the
Heatmap poll. In fact, we found the most bipartisan agreement for
supporting “clean” energy projects in two areas: job creation and
reducing the nation’s dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas.
</p>
<p>
Reducing local air and water pollution? There was a 52 percentage point
difference in support between Democrats and Republicans, with only a
third of GOP respondents identifying it as a major driver of support.
Combating climate change? That gulf widens to 66 percentage points, with
only 16% GOP support.
</p>
<p>
Whether those who favor overlooking wildlife concerns in favor of
deployment like it or not, these findings undergird an argument being
made by the ecologically-focused segments of the climate advocacy world
that planning through the transition can have a political upside.
</p>
<p>
Patrick Bigger, a senior researcher at the left-aligned Climate and
Community Project, said he wasn’t surprised by Heatmap’s findings.
</p>
<p>
“Talking about conservation polls really well and talking about climate
change polls really poorly” with some communities, Bigger said. “I think
there’s this implicit sense by folks who care about climate action that
clean and green are permanently symbiotically coded as good, and it’s
very hard to break that habit until you’re confronted with the polling
that this doesn’t actually play well with the communities you’re trying
to reach.”

<h2 id="us-to-resume-sales-of-offensive-weapons-to-saudi-arabia">US to
resume sales of ‘offensive’ weapons to Saudi Arabia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States said Monday it would resume sales of
offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia, ending a yearslong suspension
triggered by the kingdom’s bloody operations in Yemen. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With Saudi Arabia once again seen as a pivotal player for the United
States as the Gaza war enters its 10th month, the State Department said
it would return to weapons sales “in regular order with appropriate
congressional notification and consultation.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Saudi Arabia has remained a close strategic partner of the United
States, and we look forward to enhancing that partnership,” State
Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>President Joe Biden took office in 2021 pledging a new approach to
Saudi Arabia that emphasizes human rights and immediately announced that
the administration would only send “defensive” weaponry to the longtime
U.S. partner. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The step came after thousands of civilians were estimated to be
killed in Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen, including children, in a
campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who have taken over much
of the country. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But geopolitical considerations have changed markedly since then. The
United Nations, with U.S. support, brokered a truce in early 2022 that
has largely held. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the truce, “there has not been a single Saudi airstrike into
Yemen and cross-border fire from Yemen into Saudi Arabia has largely
stopped,” Patel said. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Saudis since that time have met their end of the deal, and we
are prepared to meet ours,” Patel said.</p>

<h2 id="elon-musk-to-interview-trump-on-x-social-media-network">Elon
Musk to interview Trump on X social media network</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is due to interview
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on the X social media
network on Monday in an event that could inject more surprises into the
turbulent U.S. presidential election.</p>
<p>The interview, scheduled for 8 p.m. Eastern Time (0000 Tuesday GMT),
could provide the former president an opportunity to seize the limelight
at a time when his campaign is seen as sagging.</p>
<p>His Democratic rival for the Nov. 5 election, Vice President Kamala
Harris, has erased Trump’s lead in opinion polls and energized
Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies.</p>
<p>The interview on Musk’s social media platform could allow Trump to
reach a different audience than the conservative faithful who attend his
rallies and watch his interviews on Fox News. However, similar events on
the platform have been plagued by technical problems.</p>
<p>“Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight &amp; tomorrow in
advance of the conversation,” Musk wrote on the platform, formerly known
as Twitter.</p>
<p>The interview will be hosted live using Trump’s official X account,
his campaign said on Sunday. Trump’s access to his account, <span
class="citation" data-cites="realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</span>,
was restored a month into Musk’s ownership of X after being suspended by
the platform’s previous owners following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on
Congress by his supporters.</p>
<p>Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social social media platform,
which was launched in February 2022. On Monday morning, Trump returned
to X for the first time in a year, posting an ad that highlighted his
claim that the four criminal prosecutions he faces are politically
motivated.</p>
<p>His last X post before Monday was one in August 2023 appealing for
donations and showing a mug shot after he was booked at an Atlanta jail
in relation to felony charges tied to his attempts to overturn his 2020
election defeat in Georgia.</p>
<p>Musk could prove to be an unusual interviewer. The world’s richest
person backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked
rightward since and endorsed the Republican following the attempted
assassination of Trump in July.</p>
<p>Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla, also started a
fundraising organization to support Trump’s campaign. The political
action committee is now under investigation in Michigan for possible
violations of state laws on gathering voter information.</p>
<p>Trump, a longstanding critic of electric vehicles, shifted gears
after Musk’s endorsement.</p>
<p>“I’m for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very
strongly. So I have no choice,” Trump said at an early August rally.</p>
<p>United Auto Workers President Shawn Fein, campaigning in support of
Harris, called Trump a “sellout.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles
through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of
reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.</p>
<p>Republicans in Congress have opposed those subsidies. Senator JD
Vance, Trump’s vice presidential running mate, said the Biden policy
merely subsidizes rich people who purchase the cars.</p>
<p>Advertisers have fled X since Musk bought it in 2022 and subsequently
reduced content moderation that has resulted in a dramatic increase in
hate speech, civil rights groups have said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the entrepreneur has been involved in a swirl of
additional controversies. He has falsely accused Biden and the
Democratic Party of opening U.S. borders to undocumented immigrants in a
ploy to boost the number of potential Democratic voters. Non-citizens
are not allowed to vote in federal elections.</p>
<p>Musk in November 2023 endorsed an antisemitic post on X that said
members of the Jewish community were stoking hatred against white
people. He defended himself, saying the user was speaking “the actual
truth.” Musk has also attacked the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit
that works to fight antisemitism, accusing it, without evidence, of
being responsible for a drop in advertising on X.</p>

I come bearing good news for a change: Most of the United States will
see reasonable summer temperatures this week! With, of course, a few
exceptions …
</p>
<h3>
Debby brings cooler days across the country
</h3>
<p>
Hurricane Debby, which first made landfall in Florida last Tuesday, has
set new weather trends in motion. After hitting Georgia and South
Carolina, the storm continued north, reaching the Northeast last Friday.
The wind and rainfall brought cooler, less humid air into the region,
Reneé Duff, senior meteorologist at Accuweather, told me.
<strong>Temperatures in the Northeast — which were several degrees below
historical averages this weekend — will continue to be more comfortable
this week compared to the recent past.</strong> Same goes for the
northern Plains and Midwest.
</p>
<p>
In the Southeast, where the hurricane has caused the most destruction,
temperatures will be near their historical averages — around the low 90s
degrees Fahrenheit. While the cool-off will be good for those trying to
recover after the storm, Duff told me that higher humidity levels with
rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the region may still end up
slowing cleanup efforts.
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Despite Debby, the heat has found a way to stick itself to some states.
<strong>Parts of Texas and New Mexico will see temperatures much higher
than those expected for this time of the year</strong>, Tom Kines,
senior meteorologist at Accuweather, told me.<strong> </strong>During
the later part of the week, an intense heat wave will build across
Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas. On Thursday, southern
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama will be under extreme heat risk
alerts, according to
<a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/heatrisk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a>
from the National Weather Service.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
The rest of the country should “experience temperatures close to where
they should be for this time of year,” Kines told me.
</p>
<h3>
More updates on the Park Fire
</h3>
<p>
Little progress has been made on containing the Park Fire since last
week. <strong>The wildfire, which is now 38% contained, continues to
grow aggressively. </strong>Climate scientist Daniel Swain of the
University of California, Los Angeles, explained in a live briefing
Thursday that while parts of the fire that had been burning through
grass have been contained, in its northeastern flank, the fire is
currently ravaging through timber plantations which burn more violently
than natural forests. The fire has now also reached the Lassen National
Forest, burning over 100,000 acres of the protected area.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Some useful numbers:</strong> Ranking directly above the Park
Fire among the largest wildfires in California’s history (for the
moment) is the Mendocino Complex Fire of July 2018, which burned around
460,000 acres, but lasted
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2018/7/27/ranch-fire-mendocino-complex" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>161
days</u></a>. The Park Fire has already scorched almost 430,000 acres in
less than 20 days. The largest fire in California’s history was the 2020
August Complex fire, which devoured more than a million acres over 87
days.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There is one tiny bit of good news: According to
<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2024/7/24/park-fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>updates</u></a>
from Cal Fire, <strong>firefighters have been able to lift evacuation
orders and warnings in Butte County</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, other wildfires have continued to pop up in California. On
Tuesday, the Crozier Fire started in El Dorado County, and almost 2,000
acres have so far been burned. While not as powerful as the Park Fire,
Crozier is also growing fast and in a more densely populated area, Swain
said.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> The heat wave in California has broken,
with near average — and maybe even lower — temperatures in store this
week. The only issue is that the cooler weather comes from stronger
winds, which are not ideal for containing a wildfire. <strong>Despite
more forgiving temperatures, wildfire risk will remain high in
California for the foreseeable future. </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Alaska has been super weird
</h3>
<p>
In late July, an especially long and intense heat wave settled over
Alaska. On July 22, Fairbanks hit 90 degrees, breaking the previous
record of 89 set last year. <strong> On that day, it was hotter in
northern Alaska than it was in Atlanta.</strong>
</p>
<p>
The fact that such high temperatures are being seen so late into the
summer in Alaska is particularly concerning, Brian Brettschneider, a
climate scientist for the NWS,
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alaskan-heat-wave-will-send-temperatures-soaring-to-90-degrees-f/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a>
<em><em>Scientific American</em></em>. Peak temperatures usually happen
much sooner, in June; by July, after the summer solstice, Alaska gets
fewer hours of sunlight, so temperatures should start settling down.
Alaskans’ housing and habits are all adapted to keep the cold away, so
scientists are worried about the health risks of prolonged high
temperatures in the state.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> While temperatures in Alaska dipped
below average this weekend in the central and southern parts of the
state, the mercury will soon start rising again. <strong>“If there is
more record-breaking heat, the middle of the month would be the most
likely time frame,” Duff told me. </strong>The possibility of
record-breaking heat will decrease again starting at the end of August,
but temperatures will continue to be warmer than average in the northern
part of the state.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
A heat wave in South Korea is killing livestock by the thousands
</h3>
<p>
East Asian countries have been sizzling this summer, and South Korea is
no exception. Following the end of the monsoon season in late July,
Seoul has constantly seen temperatures of 89 degrees and up. Most of the
country has seen temperatures 10 degrees higher than historical
averages. <strong>The relentless heat has led to almost

heat-related illnesses and 17 fatalities</strong></u></a><strong> since
the start of the summer. </strong>In some regions, including Jeju,
people are struggling to keep livestock alive, for example using fans
and air conditioners to try to cool down the island’s rare black pigs.
Over
<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-boils-in-summer-heat-that-may-set-new-records" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>300,000</u></a>
livestock have died since mid-July.
</p>
<p>
“The heat is mostly due to a persistent area of high pressure over the
Philippine Sea with the high’s axis reaching to the Korean Peninsula
over the past week to 10 days,” Duff explained.
</p>
<p>
The country has opened
<a href="https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2024/08/south-korea-high-temperatures-forecast-across-most-of-the-country-through-at-least-aug-19-update-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>50,000
cooling shelters</u></a> in response to the heat crisis, on top of
smaller-scale counter-measures such as distributing umbrellas and salt
tablets to try to keep people cool and hydrated.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead: Despite some cloudiness and rain this past
Friday, the scorching heat will prevail this week in the
country.</strong> “A better chance for relief from the heat may come
late next week or early the week of August 19,” Duff told me.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Extreme heat in northern Canada is making some miss the winter
</h3>
<p>
Several communities in northern Canada broke heat records last week.
Temperatures
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/canada-arctic-region-heat-wave" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reached</u></a>
95 degrees, breaking the record of 91 set last year. Inuvik, which saw
its second ever recorded heat wave this summer, has been especially
vulnerable to the recent heat. The region’s famous midnight sunsets
means heat takes longer to dissipate, exacerbating the issues with low
water levels in the Mackenzie River. Due to the dry and hot conditions,
the community so used to ice and snow is now concerned about wildfires.
Regions in Canada that have been historically shielded from major fire
threats have been in the line of destruction in recent years,
<em><em>The Guardian</em></em>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/09/canada-wildfire-record-climate-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> In Inuvik, temperatures will stay below
68 degrees for most of this week. While it seems like record-breaking
heat is now behind northern Canada, it’s harder to say when drought
conditions might improve. At least in the next 10 days, heavy
precipitation is not predicted for the Northwest Territories.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Research corner:
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Over 70% of the global workforce is at risk from extreme heat-related
death and injuries, according to a United Nations
<a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/unsg_call_to_action_on_extreme_heat_for_release.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a>
— that’s almost 2.5 billion workers. While Africa leads as the region
with the highest percentage of vulnerable workers, the report also
points out that the number of those vulnerable in Europe is growing at
the fastest rate.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
In Montana, Missoula County first responders teamed up with researchers
at the University of Montana to investigate the most vulnerable group to
extreme heat. After going through 911 calls, they
<a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/08/07/rural-seniors-heat-wave-montana/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a>
that those living in rural areas — which also tends to have older
populations — were the ones that required most assistance during periods
of intense heat. They also found that every 1 degree Celsius increase in
average daily temperatures led to a 1% increase in 911 activity,
i.e. hundreds of additional distress calls.
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
A
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/electricity-bill-air-conditioning-64f1d13bbb6d3523a6cc31d0b4fb14af" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll</a>
from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed
that seven in 10 Americans have seen the impact of extreme heat on their
electricity bills in the past year. In the past five years, according to
the survey, 70% of Americans have been personally affected by extreme
heat. Those in the West and South were more likely to report having been
impacted by the hot weather than those in the Northeast.

delays are a $1.3 billion lithium refinery in South Carolina, a $1

combination of factors, including overproduction of clean tech from
China, macroeconomic pressures, policy confusion, and a drop in EV

a “paint-on solar cell,” matches the energy efficiency performance of a
traditional single-layer silicon PV and is almost 150 times thinner than
a modern silicon wafer. Could this replace silicon-based solar panels
altogether? Not anytime soon, Casey wrote, but it could turn almost
anything into a solar surface. “We can envisage perovskite coatings
being applied to broader types of surfaces to generate cheap solar
power, such as the roofs of cars and buildings and even the backs of
mobile phones,” said Dr. Junke Wang, a Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions
Postdoc Fellow at Oxford University Physics. “If more solar energy can
be generated in this way, we can foresee less need in the longer term to

observed that a group of 180-year-old oak trees exposed to elevated CO2
emissions over a seven-year period made about 10% more woody biomass
than trees that didn’t experience the emissions rise. The added wood
locks away the gas for decades. The study is only about half-way done

results demonstrate the power of mature forests to act as a natural
climate solution. “This is evidence in favor of careful management of

id="from-paris-to-los-angeles-how-the-city-is-preparing-for-the-2028-olympics">From
Paris to Los Angeles: How the city is preparing for the 2028
Olympics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — It’s Los Angeles’ turn for the torch. Mayor Karen Bass
accepted the Olympic flag at the Paris closing ceremony Sunday, before
handing it off to a key representative of LA’s local business — Tom
Cruise — who in a pre-recorded trek via motorcycle, plane and parachute
kicked off the countdown to 2028.</p>
<p>The city will become the third in the world to host the games three
times as it adds to the storied years of 1932 and 1984. Here’s a look
forward and back in time at the Olympics in LA.</p>
<p>LA’s Olympic trilogy</p>
<p>Los Angeles got the 2028 games as a consolation prize when Paris was
picked for 2024.</p>
<p>Back in 1932, LA hosted its first Olympics. The city was the only
bidder for the games at a time marred by the Great Depression and the
absence of several nations. Yet memorable sport moments came from
athletes including American athlete Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who won
golds in the new women’s events of javelin and hurdles.</p>
<p>Financial and cultural success gave 1984 a reputation as the “good”
Olympics” which made seemingly every major world city want their
own.</p>
<p>Emphasizing both the modern and the classical with a hand from
Hollywood, the games opened with decathlon champion Rafer Johnson
lighting the torch, a guy in a jetpack descending into the Memorial
Coliseum and theme music by “Star Wars” maestro John Williams.</p>
<p>With Eastern Bloc countries boycotting, the U.S. dominated. Carl
Lewis and Mary Lou Retton are among the athletes who became household
names. A young Michael Jordan led the men’s basketball team to gold.</p>
<p>The games renewed, for a while, the global reputation of a city that
had been perceived to be in decline.</p>
<p>“We want our games to be a modern games, youthful, full of the
optimism that Southern California brings to the world and the globe,”
Janet Evans, four-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming and chief
athlete officer for the LA 2028 organizing committee, told The
Associated Press in Paris.</p>
<p>Passing the torch</p>
<p>Bass, who arrives back in LA Monday, spent these games in Paris along
with organizers and city officials, learning what it takes to host the
world’s largest sporting event.</p>
<p>Joining her were LA28 Chairperson Casey Wasserman, an entertainment
executive, and LA councilmember Traci Park, chair of the city Olympic
committee.</p>
<p>“As we’ve seen here in Paris, the Olympics are an opportunity to make
transformative change,” Bass said at a press conference ahead of the
closing ceremony.</p>
<p>Venues old and new, plus a swimming stadium</p>
<p>Amid a stadium-and-arena boom, LA will polish existing structures
rather than erect new ones.</p>
<p>“It’s a no-build games,” Evans said.</p>
<p>After Paris’ innovative opening ceremony on the Seine River, LA plans
to open with a traditional, stadium-based approach at SoFi Stadium in
neighboring Inglewood that also incorporates the century-old Memorial
Coliseum in Los Angeles itself.</p>
<p>Home to two NFL teams, SoFi has hosted a Super Bowl and several
Taylor Swift concerts since opening in 2020. It will become what
organizers say is the largest Olympic swimming venue ever. Its opening
ceremony role means swimming will come after track and field for the
first time since 1972.</p>
<p>Intuit Dome, the soon-to-open Inglewood home of the NBA’s Clippers,
would be the games’ newest major venue and is the planned home for
Olympic basketball. The Lakers’ downtown Crypto.com Arena will host
gymnastics.</p>
<p>The toxicity of swimming in the Seine became a serious issue in
Paris. That could put renewed focus on the Long Beach area waterfront
when it hosts marathon swimming and triathlon races. Its cleanliness
history is mixed but its ocean waters got consistently high marks in a
2023 analysis by nonprofit Heal the Bay.</p>
<p>The Long Beach shore was home to the pre-recorded performances during
Sunday’s ceremony of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop
Dogg and Dr. Dre, though it was easy to mistake for LA’s Venice Beach,
where the journey of the flag begun by Cruise was shown ending moments
earlier.</p>
<p>Trains, buses and traffic</p>
<p>A city that’s notoriously hard to traverse may seem like an odd fit
for the Olympics, but it can work.</p>
<p>Bass said she plans to emulate the tactics of Tom Bradley, the mayor
in 1984, whose traffic mitigations had some saying it was better than at
non-Olympic times. They include asking local businesses to stagger
workforce hours to reduce the number of cars on the road and allow work
from home during the 17-day games.</p>
<p>Landing the Olympics under then-Mayor Eric Garcetti in 2017 gave the
city an unusually long lead time for planning.</p>
<p>While it’s no Paris Metro, LA has built a subway since its last
Olympics, with lines running past major venues.</p>
<p>In 2018, the city planned an ambitious slate of 28 bus and rail
projects to transform public transit. Some were scrapped but others
moved forward, including the extension of a subway line to connect
downtown Los Angeles with UCLA, the planned home of the Olympic
Village.</p>
<p>Another high-profile project is the Inglewood People Mover, an
automated, three-stop rail line past major Olympic venues. It initially
received a commitment of $1 billion in federal funding, but opposition
from Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters led to a $200 million reduction, the
Los Angeles Times reported. It’s unclear whether the line will be
completed by 2028.</p>
<p>Metro recently received $900 million in funding through an
infrastructure spending package and grants from the Biden
administration, of which $139 million will go directly toward improving
transportation by 2028 and the goal of a “car-free” Olympics.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge is not waiting to 2028, but really taking the
opportunity between now and 2028 to help Angelenos and visitors alike
reimagine the transportation network as something that will be their
first choice,” Metro CEO Stephanie Wiggins said.</p>
<p>Crime, safety and perception</p>
<p>While crime rates were considerably higher in 1984 than today, the
countdown to 2028 comes as the issue has gotten increased attention and
cast a social-media-amplified shadow.</p>
<p>The Olympics are designated as a national special security event,
which makes the U.S. Secret Service the lead agency tasked with
developing a security plan, supported by significant federal
resources.</p>
<p>LA city and county law enforcement sent officers to Paris to observe,
learn and assist as they prepare for their own 2028 games.</p>
<p>There are many more encampments on city streets than there were in
1984, and it’s unlikely LA will have solved its homeless crisis in the
next four years. As the Paris games ended, California Gov. Gavin Newsom
threatened to withhold funding from cities unable to clear
encampments.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Games in Paris, organizers relocated thousands of
unhoused people, a practice also used for the 2016 Rio de Janiero games
and criticized by activists as “social cleansing.”</p>
<p>Tourists and finances</p>
<p>LA is the “next logical destination” for the Olympics, said Adam
Burke, president and CEO of the LA Tourism and Convention Board. “LA has
emerged as really one of the world’s sports capitals.”</p>
<p>First though, the city will host a FIFA World Cup event and U.S.
Women’s Open in 2026 and another Super Bowl in 2027.</p>
<p>The city’s hotel industry has continued to see growth, adding 9,000
new hotel rooms in the past four years with more to come over the next
four.</p>
<p>LA28 organizers are banking on ticket sales, sponsorships, payments
from the International Olympic Committee and other revenue streams to
cover the games’ $6.9 billion budget. The committee has brought in just
over $1 billion toward a goal of $2.5 billion in domestic corporate
sponsorships.</p>

id="americans-refusal-to-keep-paying-higher-prices-may-be-dealing-a-final-blow-to-us-inflation-spike">Americans’
refusal to keep paying higher prices may be dealing a final blow to US
inflation spike</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The great inflation spike of the past three years is
nearly spent — and economists credit American consumers for helping slay
it.</p>
<p>Some of America’s largest companies, from Amazon to Disney to Yum
Brands, say their customers are increasingly seeking cheaper alternative
products and services, searching for bargains or just avoiding items
they deem too expensive. Consumers aren’t cutting back enough to cause
an economic downturn. Rather, economists say, they appear to be
returning to pre-pandemic norms, when most companies felt they couldn’t
raise prices very much without losing business.</p>
<p>“While inflation is down, prices are still high, and I think
consumers have gotten to the point where they’re just not accepting it,”
Tom Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said last
week at a conference of business economists. “And that’s what you want:
The solution to high prices is high prices.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A more price-sensitive consumer helps explain why inflation has
appeared to be steadily falling toward the Federal Reserve’s 2% target,
ending a period of painfully high prices that strained many people’s
budgets and darkened their outlooks on the economy. It also assumed a
central place in the presidential election, with inflation leading many
Americans to turn sour on the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of
the economy.</p>
<p>The reluctance of consumers to keep paying more has forced companies
to slow their price increases — or even to cut them. The result is a
cooling of inflation pressures.</p>
<p>Other factors have also helped tame inflation, including the healing
of supply chains, which has boosted the availability of cars, trucks,
meats and furniture, among other items, and the high interest rates
engineered by the Fed, which slowed sales of homes, cars and appliances
and other interest rate-sensitive purchases.</p>
<p>Still, a key question now is whether shoppers will pull back so much
as to put the economy at risk. Consumer spending makes up more than
two-thirds of economic activity. With evidence emerging that the job
market is cooling, a drop in spending could potentially derail the
economy. Such fears caused stock prices to plummet a week ago, though
markets have since rebounded.</p>
<p>This week, the government will provide updates on both inflation and
the health of the American consumer. On Wednesday, it will release the
consumer price index for July. It’s expected to show that prices —
excluding volatile food and energy costs — rose just 3.2% from a year
earlier. That would be down from 3.3% in June and would be the lowest
such year-over-year inflation figure since April 2021.</p>
<p>And on Thursday, the government will report last month’s retail
sales, which are expected to have climbed a decent 0.3% from June. Such
a gain would suggest that while Americans have become vigilant about
their money, they are still willing to spend.</p>
<p>Many businesses have noticed.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing lower average selling prices … right now because
customers continue to trade down on price when they can,” said Andrew
Jassy, CEO of Amazon.</p>
<p>David Gibbs, CEO of Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza
Hut, told investors that a more cost-conscious consumer has slowed its
sales, which slipped 1% in the April-June quarter at stores open for at
least a year.</p>
<p>“Ensuring we provide consumers affordable options,” Gibbs said, “has
been an area of greater focus for us since last year.”</p>
<p>Other companies are cutting prices outright. Dormify, an online
retailer that sells dorm supplies, is offering comforters starting at
$69, down from $99 a year ago.</p>
<p>According to the Fed’s “Beige Book,” an anecdotal collection of
business reports from around the country that is released eight times a
year, companies in nearly all 12 Fed districts have described similar
experiences.</p>
<p>“Almost every district mentioned retailers discounting items or
price-sensitive consumers only purchasing essentials, trading down in
quality, buying fewer items or shopping around for the best deals,” the
Beige Book said last month.</p>
<p>Most economists say consumers are still spending enough to sustain
the economy consistently. Barkin said most of the businesses in his
district — which covers Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and North and
South Carolina — report that demand remains solid, at least at the right
price.</p>
<p>“The way I’d put it is, consumers are still spending, but they’re
choosing,” Barkin said.</p>
<p>In a speech a couple of weeks ago, Jared Bernstein, who leads the
Biden administration’s Council of Economic Advisers, mentioned consumer
caution as a reason why inflation is nearing the end of a “round trip”
back to the Fed’s 2% target level.</p>
<p>Emerging from the pandemic, Bernstein noted, consumers were flush
with cash after receiving several rounds of stimulus checks and having
slashed their spending on in-person services. Their improved finances
“gave certain firms the ability to flex a pricing power that was much
less prevalent pre-pandemic.” After COVID, consumers were “less
responsive to price increases,” Bernstein said.</p>
<p>As a result, “the old adage that the cure for high prices is high
prices [was] temporarily disengaged,” Bernstein said.</p>
<p>So some companies raised prices even more than was needed to cover
their higher input costs, thereby boosting their profits. Limited
competition in some industries, Bernstein added, made it easier for
companies to charge more.</p>
<p>Barkin noted that before the pandemic, inflation remained low as
online shopping, which makes price comparisons easy, became increasingly
prevalent. Major retailers also held down costs, and increased U.S. oil
production brought down gas prices.</p>
<p>“A price increase was so rare,” Barkin said, “that if someone came to
you with a 5% or 10% price increase, you almost just threw them out,
like, ‘How could you possibly do it?’”</p>
<p>That changed in 2021.</p>
<p>“There are labor shortages, Barkin said. “Supply chain shortages. And
the price increases are coming to you from everywhere. Your gardener is
raising your prices, and you don’t have the capacity to do anything
other than accept them.”</p>
<p>The economist Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts,
Amherst, dubbed this phenomenon “sellers’ inflation” in 2023. In an
influential paper, she wrote that “publicly reported supply chain
bottlenecks” can “create legitimacy for price hikes” and “create
acceptance on the part of consumers to pay higher prices.”</p>
<p>Consumers are no longer so accepting, Barkin said.</p>
<p>“People have a little bit more time to stop and say, ‘How do I feel
about paying $9.89 for a 12-pack of Diet Coke when I used to pay $5.99?’
They don’t like it that much, and so people are making choices.”</p>
<p>Barkin said he expects this trend to continue to slow price increases
and cool inflation.</p>
<p>“I’m actually pretty optimistic that over the next few months, we’re
going to see good readings on the inflation side,” he said. “All the
elements of inflation seem to be settling down.”</p>

is pushing joy. Trump paints a darker picture. Will moods matter?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — At the top of his first speech as her running mate,
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz turned to Vice President Kamala Harris and
declared, “Thank you for bringing back the joy.” The next day, Harris
took the theme a step further, branding the Democratic ticket “joyful
warriors.”</p>
<p>Contrast that with former President Donald Trump, who opened a news
conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida a few days later by saying,
“We have a lot of bad things coming up,” and predicting the U.S. could
fall into an economic depression unseen since the dark days of 1929 or
even another world war.</p>
<p>“I think that our country is, right now, in the most dangerous
position it’s ever been in, from an economic standpoint, from a safety
standpoint,” Trump said Thursday.</p>
<p>Democrats are playing up their sunnier outlook, promoting the idea
that voters can be inspired to support someone and not just cast their
ballot against the other side. The Trump campaign argues their candidate
is reflecting the dour mood of the country and dismisses the idea that a
growing contrast in tone and upbeat attitude will decide the
presidency.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Americans reported feeling very or somewhat pessimistic
about the state of politics, according to polling by The Associated
Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research from last month. Roughly 7
in 10 said things in the country are heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the former president, said people
don’t care about “vibe checks.”</p>
<p>“That’s not making gas or food or housing less expensive,” Miller
said.</p>
<p>Walz promotes positivity</p>
<p>Still, just how hard Harris is betting on the opposite approach is
evident in her decision to pick Walz, whose personal story includes
being on the coaching staff of a high school football team that had gone
winless just a few years earlier to clinching a state championship in
1999.</p>
<p>The Minnesota governor’s relentless positivity is meant to give
supporters a jolt of new energy and keep the momentum that Harris has
built after President Joe Biden — facing mounting pressure from within
his own party and increasingly pessimistic views about his chances in
November — stepped aside and endorsed his vice president.</p>
<p>Walz spent his first week as Harris’ running mate traveling to swing
states with Harris and underscored the point during a rally in Eau
Claire, Wisconsin, celebrating what he said was “the ability to talk
about what can be good.”</p>
<p>“This idea of caring for our neighbor and kindness, and a hand up
when somebody needs it. And just the sense that people go through things
and to be able to be there when they need it, that’s who we are,” he
said. “It’s not about mocking. It’s not name-calling.”</p>
<p>Biden often ended his speeches saying he’d never been more
optimistic. But he built his now-shuttered reelection bid around
branding Trump an existential threat to democracy. The president offered
dire predictions about the former president, suggesting he’d dismantle
the nation’s founding principles should he retake the White House.</p>
<p>Harris’ campaign still relies on many of the same themes, decrying
Trump as a threat to democracy, warning that he’ll impose draconian
limits to abortion and voting and that he will follow Project 2025, a
plan championed by top conservatives to remake large swaths of the
federal government.</p>
<p>And despite Walz insisting that smiles were more powerful than
insults, he and Harris have continued their share of denunciations,
decrying Trump’s conviction in New York on 34 felony counts in a
hush-money case and his being found liable for fraudulent business
practices and sexual abuse in civil court.</p>
<p>Still, even before she named Walz her running mate, Harris was
suggesting that she could help make politics fun again.</p>
<p>“We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of
patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country,” Harris declared in
campaign speeches before picking Walz. She now tells crowds that she and
her running mate “both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them
down.”</p>
<p>Paula Montagna, who went to see Harris and Walz at a rally outside
Detroit last week, highlighted the shift in messaging since Harris took
over from Biden.</p>
<p>“Kamala is so positive, and it’s nice to hear positive instead of
negative,” Montagna said.</p>
<p>Trump team says their candidate is reflecting reality</p>
<p>Trump’s senior campaign advisers counter that the mood of the country
right now is sour over the economy, the state of the U.S.-Mexico border
and turmoil in the Middle East and beyond. They see their candidate as
reflecting that reality rather than what they believe is a temporary
exuberance igniting the Democratic base after months of discouragement
over their ticket.</p>
<p>Trump has tried to harness that with his repeated predictions of
stock market crashes and war. His campaign appearances have included a
long list of other warnings that have veered into the apocalyptic,
saying that if he’s not elected, “we’re not going to have a country
anymore,” that “the only thing standing between you and its obliteration
is me,” and that under a Harris administration, “Social Security will
buckle and collapse” and “the suburbs will be overrun with violent crime
and savage foreign gangs.”</p>
<p>During his Republican National Convention speech last month, where
his advisers said Trump would seem changed and more personal after
surviving an attempted assassination, the former president did strike a
different tone — at least to start.</p>
<p>He said early on that he had “a message of confidence, strength and
hope” and sought to “launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom
for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.”</p>
<p>But by the end, Trump had returned to predictions of doom, twice
warning, “Bad things are going to happen.”</p>
<p>Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, has drawn a sharp contrast
with Walz. Vance has been cheered on the right for being an aggressive
fighter on behalf of the former president, particularly when engaging
with reporters.</p>
<p>“Right now, I am angry about what Kamala Harris has done to this
country and done to the American southern border,” Vance said at a
campaign stop in Michigan. “And I think most people in our country, they
can be happy-go-lucky sometimes, they can enjoy things sometimes, and
they can turn on the news and recognize that what’s going on in this
country is a disgrace.”</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, not himself known for a
sunny disposition, offered much the same assessment Friday at a
conservative conference in Atlanta hosted by radio host Erick
Erickson.</p>
<p>“The country is obviously in a bad mood,” McConnell said.</p>
<p>Trump supporters waiting to see him at a rally in Bozeman, Montana,
said they felt the former president’s campaign made them feel positive —
even if his message often isn’t.</p>
<p>“Just looking at the state of the country now, I don’t think Kamala
Harris’ campaign is one of joy and hope. I think that’s Trump’s
campaign,” said Alex Lustig, a 23-year-old from Billings, Montana.</p>
<p>Fred Scarlett, a 63-year-old retiree from Condon, Montana, said that
“everyone understands that we need to be here to support Trump because
he has never let us down.”</p>
<p>“They shoot at him,” Scarlett said, “and he still keeps firing
back.”</p>

My sister just got back from two months in Europe and returned bearing
gifts, including this adorable onesie for our baby in utero that I just
had to share 😅 I couldn’t help but quip, “Ah, a country I’ve never been
to!” (in good humour – it’s super cute, I was very appreciative!) but
seriously, I guess I do have some Irish heritage, and therefore, so does
our baby, so it still works. It’s a gorgeous onesie in any case 😂
