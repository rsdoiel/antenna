As people process news of the attempted assassination of former

the workplace — like the rest of America — is a polarized place. Today,
we’re joined by Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., president and CEO of the Society

conversations over differing political viewpoints. Plus: a pulse check

<li>Survey: Americans’ support for solar and wind drops</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p>
A new survey released today from nonprofit research institution
Resources for the Future has some interesting insights into Americans’
attitudes about climate change. The overall takeaway from the
<a href="https://www.rff.org/publications/reports/american-understanding-of-climate-change/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--QqenkZKx8b-ufD7xLVaERZBo_ZU5UOhTDS2W1bTvlZHiIJlvSlsgIGQXix7YMcGveW7GA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Climate
Insights 2024</a> report is that the public’s views on the issue “have
remained remarkably steady” since the group’s first survey in 1997. Most
respondents believe, as they did 27 years ago, that the Earth’s
temperature is warming (75%) and that human activity is at least partly
to blame (83%). But a few things <em><em>have</em></em> changed over the
years:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Americans feel they know more about climate change.
</strong>Today 73% of respondents say they know “at least a moderate
amount” about the issue compared to 42% in 1997.
</li>
<li>
<strong>More people see climate as their top issue. </strong>Twenty-one
percent of Americans care deeply about climate change, pay attention to
the news about the issue, and are likely to vote based on candidates’
climate policies. That’s up from 9% in 1997.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Confidence in government action has risen recently.
</strong>Today, 51% of Americans say the federal government is
addressing climate change, up from 44% in 2020.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Attitudes about renewables have shifted since 2013, and not
necessarily in a good way. </strong>A majority of people still favor
wind and solar power but their enthusiasm is wavering: Support for solar
is down from 91% to 83%; support for wind is down from 84% to 70%.
</li>
<li>
<strong>More Americans support nuclear, aren’t sure about coal, and
dislike natural gas</strong>. Support for nuclear power has risen from
33% to 44%. On the flip side, support for natural gas has declined 10
percentage points to just 38%. Americans’ attitudes about coal haven’t
changed much but remain unfavorable – only 18% said they think coal
should be used to make electricity.

Nim</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>I decided to document my journey of writing an OS in Nim. Why Nim?
It’s one of the few languages that allow low-level systems programming
with deterministic memory management (garbage collector is optional)
with destructors and move semantics. It’s also statically typed, which
provides greater type safety. It also supports inline assembly, which is
a must for OS development. Other options include C, C++, Rust, and Zig.
They’re great languages, but I chose Nim for its simplicity, elegance,
and performance. ↫ Fusion OS documentation website I love it when a
hobby operating system project not only uses a less common programming
language, but the author also details the entire development process in
great detail. It’s not a UNIX-like, and the goals are a single 64 bit
address space, capability-based security model, and a lot more. It’s
targeting UEFI machines, and the code is, of course, open source and
available on GitHub.</p>

id="trump-rally-shooting-becomes-hot-topic-on-chinas-social-media">Trump
rally shooting becomes hot topic on China’s social media</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — The shooting at a rally for former President Donald
Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday quickly became a trending
topic on China’s social media platforms Sunday.</p>
<p>The Chinese foreign ministry released a statement on its website
Sunday, indicating that the country is closely following the incident
involving Trump.</p>
<p>“President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathies to former President
Trump,” the Chinese foreign ministry said in its statement.</p>
<p>The FBI said Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, a resident of Bethel Park,
Pennsylvania, was the suspect in the attempted assassination of
Trump.</p>
<p>As of noon, Beijing time Sunday, the Weibo entry “Trump was shot” had
garnered more than 300 million views, making it the top trending topic
on the platform. Weibo, a Chinese social media platform similar to X,
formerly Twitter, mirrors trends seen on international platforms like X,
which is banned in China.</p>
<p>Not only did the entry “Trump was shot” dominate Weibo’s trending
topics, but at one point, half of the top 20 searches were related to
the shooting. Updates such as “Trump’s right ear was shot through by a
bullet,” “One person died at the scene,” and “The shooting suspect was
killed,” along with U.S. President Joe Biden’s responses, also garnered
significant attention.</p>
<p>Fast reaction came also from Chinese businesses: By noon Sunday in
Beijing, shopping websites like Taobao and Pinduoduo listed T-shirts
featuring images of Trump raising his arms after being injured. Some
internet commenters jokingly remarked, “This is the speed of Chinese
e-commerce.”</p>
<p>Major state media outlets, including Xinhua News Agency and CCTV,
extensively covered the shooting.</p>
<p>Many Chinese experts interviewed said they believed that the
assassination attempt was genuine and speculated that it could
positively influence Trump’s campaign.</p>
<p>Chinese social media was also rife with speculation that the shooting
was “self-directed and self-staged.”</p>
<p>Notably, Jin Hao, former executive editor of Xinhua News Agency’s
“World Military,” commented on Weibo, saying that, after looking at the
clips from the scene and observing Trump’s “remarkably swift” reaction,
“he [knew he] was shot as soon as he touched his ears and immediately
crouched down.” Jin remarked, “This isn’t something that ordinary people
can react to.”</p>
<p>Some Weibo users also echoed that “it has been practiced hundreds of
times.”</p>
<p>However, this conspiracy theory faced criticism from many bloggers,
and others who argued that Trump’s ear injury was just a few centimeters
away from the brain.</p>
<p>Even Jin Canrong, a professor at the School of International
Relations at Renmin University of China, known for his strong
anti-American stance, bluntly stated in an interview with the
Shanghai-based media Observer Net that this incident was “an
assassination.”</p>
<p>Jin noted that in the photos from the scene, the injured Trump raised
his hands in a fighting gesture, surrounded by Secret Service agents and
the American flag, effectively creating a heroic image for himself.</p>
<p>Currently based in California, Albert Chiu, a political science
professor at Taiwan’s Tunghai University, said in an interview with VOA
that Trump was shot during a live broadcast, and the shooter was killed
on the scene, making it hard for any “conspiracy theory” to take hold.
He emphasized that the ongoing culture of political assassination in the
United States warrants more attention.</p>
<p>According to He Yue, a member of the National Union of Journalists in
the United Kingdom, the enthusiasm of Chinese netizens for discussing
the shooting reflects daily restrictions on free speech, where “domestic
politics is off-limits.” They can only engage openly when negative
topics related to American democracy arise, He Yue said.</p>
<p>Because “Chinese netizens really cannot discuss Chinese politics,
when it comes to other countries’ political events, like the shooting,
it feels like they’ve found an outlet to vent,” he told VOA. “The most
heated discussions revolve around whether this is a ploy and who
orchestrated it. Chinese people have lived in a world of falsehoods for
too long; everything feels fake, so they use this mindset to judge
foreigners.”</p>
<p>Taiwan’s reaction</p>
<p>On Sunday, Chen Shui-bian, former Taiwanese president who was shot
while campaigning for reelection two decades ago, pointed out in
interviews with several Taiwanese media outlets that the locations of
both shootings — his in Tainan, in southern Taiwan, and Trump’s in
Butler, Pennsylvania — can be seen as “sacred places of democracy” for
both countries. Each attack resulted in minor injuries to presidential
candidates, which he characterized as “a striking coincidence.”</p>
<p>One day before the 2004 Taiwan presidential election, the “319
shooting incident” occurred. President Chen was shot while campaigning
in a jeep in Tainan. The bullet only caused a minor abdominal injury
after penetrating his clothing.</p>
<p>The Presidential Office of Taiwan stated Sunday, “President (Lai
Ching-te) extends sincere concerns to former President Trump and prays
for his speedy recovery.” Lai strongly condemned any form of political
violence and expressed his deepest condolences to all victims.</p>
<p>Eric Chu, chairman of the China-friendly opposition Kuomintang party,
also stated in an interview that he promptly expressed condolences to
the U.S. side, hoping for former President Trump’s swift recovery, and
emphasizing the party’s condemnation of political violence.</p>

convention protests are on despite shooting at Trump rally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Activists gathering in Milwaukee for the start of the
Republican National Convention say the assassination attempt on former
President Donald Trump won’t affect their long-standing plans to
demonstrate outside the convention site this week.</p>
<p>A diverse range of organizations and activists is expected outside
the downtown Fiserv Forum. The largest expected demonstration was slated
to start Monday morning.</p>
<p>The Coalition to March on the RNC, comprised largely of local groups,
planned to protest for access to abortion rights, for immigrant rights,
and against the war in Gaza among other issues.</p>
<p>“The shooting has nothing to do with us,” said Omar Flores, a
coalition spokesman, speaking about the Saturday evening shots fired at
Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. “We’re going to continue
with the march as we planned.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Secret Service has said security plans — in the works for
more than a year — remain the same after the Saturday shooting in which
Trump has said his ear was pierced by a bullet and images show blood
streaming from a wound. A nearby audience member was fatally shot and
two others critically injured in the assault, which has prompted
widespread calls to evaluate security measures.</p>
<p>The progressive coalition protesting the RNC has touted their Monday
demonstrations as “family friendly.”</p>
<p>Organizers expect an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 attendees. Separately,
the Philadelphia-based Poor People’s Army, which organizes for economic
justice, plans an afternoon march. Smaller organizations also plan to
demonstrate inside parks closer to the convention site where Trump is
set to officially accept the party’s presidential nomination later this
week.</p>
<p>Milwaukee’s leaders reiterated their confidence in security plans
Sunday as delegates, activists and journalists started arriving in town.
An estimated 30,000 people are expected.</p>
<p>Trump arrived in Milwaukee on Sunday.</p>
<p>“We take this matter very, very seriously. We take public safety
very, very seriously,” Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said Sunday.
“And I have been so pleased to work in collaboration not just with the
United States Secret Service but also with local law enforcement and
public safety on the ground here.”</p>
<p>Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said law enforcement was “working around
the clock” to be ready.</p>
<p>Before the shooting in Pennsylvania, the activist coalition had been
at odds with the city and law enforcement for months over a march route.
Activists lost a lawsuit over restrictions on where they could
demonstrate and had raised concerns about their message being
stifled.</p>
<p>But on Friday they announced a “handshake agreement” over their route
that includes allowing a city representative to accompany their protest
to “make sure things go without a hitch.”</p>
<p>City officials and federal authorities have repeatedly said their
priority is safety and insist they’ve made free speech
accommodations.</p>
<p>The city has allowed protests at two parks near the convention. One,
Haymarket Square Park, is visible from the convention site. There is to
be a city-provided stage in the vicinity and speakers will get 20
minutes apiece. A city sign-up lists more than 100 people with a wide
range of agendas, including anti-abortion rights activists, veterans
groups and political candidates. The other park, Zeidler Union Square,
is just under a mile away.</p>
<p>Activists say they’ll infuse their messages with moments of levity,
including costumes and a television ventriloquist who is bringing a
Trump puppet.</p>
<p>Heavy police presence is also assured.</p>
<p>Many activists are using the experience in Milwaukee to prepare for
the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month. That event is
expected to draw even more people, and Chicago police have been
undergoing training on constitutional policing and preparing for the
possibility of mass arrests.</p>
<p>Milwaukee police have done some exercises related to the convention,
though not widespread training.</p>
<p>“With any very large gathering, people must always be on top of their
toes,” said Hilario Deleon, chairman of the Milwaukee County Republican
Party. “If it’s successful, the city is successful.”</p>

id="google-can-totally-explain-why-chromium-browsers-quietly-tell-only-its-websites-about-your-cpu-gpu-usage">Google
can totally explain why Chromium browsers quietly tell only its websites
about your CPU, GPU usage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s time for Google being Google, this time by using an undocumented
APIs to track resource usage when using Chrome. When visiting a
*.google.com domain, the Google site can use the API to query the
real-time CPU, GPU, and memory usage of your browser, as well as info
about the processor you’re using, so that whatever service is being
provided – such as video-conferencing with Google Meet – could, for
instance, be optimized and tweaked so that it doesn’t overly tax your
computer. The functionality is implemented as an API provided by an
extension baked into Chromium – the browser brains primarily developed
by Google and used in Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and others. ↫ Brandon
Vigliarolo at The Register The original goal of the API was to give
Google’s various video chat services – I’ve lost count – the ability to
optimise themselves based on the available system resources. Crucially,
though, this API is only available to Google’s domains, and other,
competing services cannot make use of it. This is in clear violation of
the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, and with Chrome being by far
the most popular browser in the world, and thus a clear gatekeeper, the
European Commission really should have something to say about this. For
its part, Google told The Register it claims to comply with the DMA, so
we might see a change to this API soon. Aside from optimising video chat
performance, the API, which is baked into a non-removable extension,
also tracks performance issues and crashes and reports these back to
Google. This second use, too, is at its core not a bad thing –
especially if users are given the option to opt out of such crash
analytics. Still, it seems odd to use an undocumented API for something
like this, but I’m not a developer so what do I know. Mind you, other
Chromium-based browsers also report this data back to Google, which is
wild when you think about it. Normally I would suggest people switch to
Firefox, but I’ve got some choice words for Firefox and Mozilla, too,
later today.</p>

id="pretty-pictures-bootable-floppy-disks-and-the-first-canon-cat-demo">Pretty
pictures, bootable floppy disks, and the first Canon Cat demo?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>About a month ago, Cameron Kaiser first introduced us to the Canon
Cat, a computer designed by Jeff Raskin, but abandoned within six months
by Canon, who had no idea what to do with it. In his second article on
the Cat, Kaiser dives much deeper into the software and operating system
of the Cat, even going so far as to become the first person to write
software for it. One of the most surprising aspects of the Cat is that
it’s collaborative; other users can call into your Cat using a landline
and edit the same document you’re working on remotely. Selecting text
has other functions too. When I say everything goes in the workspace, I
do mean everything. The Cat is designed to be collabourative: you can
hook up your Cat to a phone line, or at least you could when landlines
were more ubiquitous, and someone could call in and literally type into
your document remotely. If you dialed up a service, you would type into
the document and mark and send text to the remote system, and the remote
system’s response would also become part of your document. (That goes
for the RS-232 port as well, by the way. In fact, we’ll deliberately
exploit this capability for the projects in this article.) ↫ Cameron
Kaiser You can also do calculations right into the text, going so far as
allowing the user to define variables and reuse those variables
throughout the text to perform various equations and other mathematic
operations. If you go back and change the value of a variable, all other
equations using those variables are updated as well. That’s quite nifty,
especially considering the age of the Cat, and since the Cat is fixed
width, you can effectively create spreadsheets this way, too. There’s
really far too much to cover here, and I strongly suggest you head on
over and read the entire thing.</p>

<strong>Stop using ease-out, or ease-in-out, or whatever-out, in every
UI animation!</strong>
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of propaganda on the internet against ease-in, saying
that it’s “unnatural”, “unusual”, or that it’s “of the devil”. Some say
that it’s both “sluggish” and “abrupt”. Many pointing to ease-out as the
safe, smooth, satisfying messiah of animation (including its safer kin,
ease-in-out). There are even published ‘best practices’ which can be
summed up to
<a target="_blank" href="https://web.dev/articles/the-basics-of-easing">“just
use ease-out”</a>. This post is here to set things straight — in a
nonlinear fashion.
</p>
<p>
So, why not ease-out? And what to use instead?
</p>
<h2 id="reason-1-its-overused">
Reason #1. It’s overused
</h2>
<p>
Let’s get the weakest point out of the way. Ease out is boring because
it’s everywhere. Because it’s part of the browser default
<code>ease</code> function (which is a combination of a fast ease-in
with a slow ease-out).
</p>
<p>
It’s like how corners are getting rounder and rounder on the web simply
because it’s easy and built-in.

<p>
Is the public missing out on better web animations (and better corners)
because of the ubiquity of these practices? Yes.
</p>
<h2 id="reason-2-its-unrealistic">
Reason #2. It’s unrealistic
</h2>
<p>
How about a study in skeuomorphism?
</p>
<p>
Imagine a mechanical toggle switch. Something like the following video:

</iframe>
<p>
Now here’s an interactive physics simulation of the same spring-based
toggle switch:

<p>
<span><em>Drag your pointer horizontally and vertically across the

switch.</em></span>
</p>
<p>
This is a physics-based simulation with simulated forces, torques, and
constraints. Let’s slow the simulation down and show some force lines
for a better look.

<p>

</p>
<p>
Here’s what a typical motion looks like:

<p>
Notice the <span>position curve (red)</span>. <small>We’ll get to the
force curve later.</small> Does the position curve look anything
familiar? Compare that with some standard easing functions:
</p>

<span>Common easing functions. Source: MDN</span>
<p>
<strong>The toggle switch’s position curve follows the ease-in
curve!</strong> A slow start, gradually building up momentum, then
finally stopping to a satisfying ‘click’!
</p>
<p>
Contrary to “best practice”, the natural motion of a toggle switch does
not follow an ease-out nor an ease-in-out curve! I’ll go further and say
that ease-out is unnatural for any kind of UI control that represents a
tactile interaction.
</p>
<p>
Like buttons. In the real world, buttons (the ones that are nice to
press anyway) have some kind of buckling mechanism when pressed. Similar
to the toggle switch example above, there’s a buildup, a fall, and a
final ‘click’ into place.
</p>

          &lt;/video&gt;</code></pre>
<span>A button. In the real world.</span>
<p>
Best practice says that the sharp stop is unnatural and should be
avoided. But that well-defined resolution is part of what makes switches
and buttons feel good. Just imagine a button that dampens the motion the
more you press it. It’ll feel squishy and mushy. You know what else
slows down the further you go? Ease-out!
</p>
<p>
And yet, thousands of UIs still use ease out for UI controls!

<p>
Has abstract UI design gone too far?
</p>
<h3 id="counterexamples">

<p>
Of course, not all UI animations need ease in, such as macro
interactions, card movement, scrolling, expand/collapse, or any object
that ‘animate themselves’ as opposed to raw manipulation.

<p>
Unlike switches and buttons, these things don’t have a frame or housing
that can immediately stop them when they ‘bottom out’. So they have to
decelerate naturally.
</p>
<p>
In the end, it depends. But as a general rule? Ease-in for tactile
things.

provides the satisfying feedback that mechanical keys are known for (and
coincidentally, produces the ease-in motion).

<p>
This theory was introduced by a psychologist named Daniel E. Berlyne in
1970. The idea is that an increase in tension followed by a sharp
decrease produces a satisfying feeling. This framework works well for
ease-in’s case in the context of the force curve, or more directly, with
ease-in’s initial slow buildup followed by its abrupt resolution.

<p>
In storytelling or filmmaking, the
<a target="_blank" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThreeActStructure">three-act
structure</a> is a model for analysing or creating good stories. It
mirrors the tension-resolution sequence in a grander scale. And with
bigger scope comes the potential for a higher level of satisfaction —
<em>catharsis</em>. Great stories that use the three-act structure
always leave you in a state of catharsis.
</p>
<p>
Is it possible to have micro-catharses in UI animations?
</p>
<hr>
<p>
All of these patterns of satisfaction reflect ease-in’s slow buildup and
sudden resolution. While there are other kinds of satisfying phenomenon,
like <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3clqk2U3T9Y">sand
slicing</a> which has nothing to do with any of this; tension and
release is a way to induce the positive effect.
</p>
<p>
There must be a balance to the proportion of tension and release, else
the negative effects of the tension may overcome the positive effects of
release, or the tension too light that the release is too shallow. A
bubble wrap that is really hard to pop would be quite annoying, and a
grand story that ends prematurely would be disappointing. The easing
curve must be manually finetuned depending on the purpose. For buttons
and toggles, keep it shorter than a bubble wrap pop.
</p>
<p>
<span>🫰 <strong>Snap!</strong> Try snapping your fingers. Did you do
it? If so, you just made an ease-in motion.
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DHQ4mKSZXU">Don’t
believe me?</a> When people say they want <em>snappy</em> animations,
what do they really want?</span>
</p>
<h2 id="tips">
Tips
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Use a custom curve appropriate to the size of the element. Don’t use the
default ease-in because it’s likely to feel too slow for most use cases.
In CSS, there’s
<a target="_blank" href="https://cubic-bezier.com/"><code>cubic-bezier()</code></a>
for example.
</li>
<li>
Use a duration appropriate to the curve, the size of the element, and
the scale of the movement.
</li>
<li>
Partially start the animation on pointer press, not on release.
<ul>
<li>
For mouse users, there’s already an initial ‘actuation force’ required
to trigger the mouse button. In these cases, the initial velocity
shouldn’t be zero (the easing curve shouldn’t start at a horizontal
slope). For touchscreens, there’s no such actuation force.
</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>          &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
Don’t use ease-out in everything! Try ease-in! Or try a combination of
both with varying weights! Just try anything at all. Tweak your curves
as often as you tweak your paddings.

id="former-fire-chief-who-died-at-trump-rally-used-his-body-to-shield-family-from-gunfire">Former
fire chief who died at Trump rally used his body to shield family from
gunfire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Buffalo Township, Pennsylvania — The former fire chief who was killed
at a Pennsylvania rally for Donald Trump spent his final moments diving
down in front of his family, protecting them from gunfire on Saturday
during an assassination attempt against the former president.  </p>
<p>Corey Comperatore’s quick decision to use his body as a shield
against the bullets flying toward his wife and daughter rang true to the
close friends and neighbors who loved and respected the proud
50-year-old Trump supporter, noting that the Butler County resident was
a “man of conviction.”</p>
<p>“He’s a literal hero. He shoved his family out of the way, and he got
killed for them,” said Mike Morehouse, who lived next to Comperatore for
the last eight years. “He’s a hero that I was happy to have as a
neighbor.”</p>
<p>Comperatore died Saturday during what is being investigated as an
attempted assassination of Trump at a campaign rally in Butler,
Pennsylvania. At least two other people were injured: David Dutch, 57,
of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon
Township, Pennsylvania, according to the Pennsylvania State Police. Both
were listed in stable condition as of Sunday.</p>
<p>As support for Comperatore’s family began to pour in from across the
country, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden also extended
their “deepest condolences.”</p>
<p>“He was a father. He was protecting his family from the bullets that
were being fired and he lost his life, God love him,” said Biden, who
added he was praying for the full recovery of the wounded.</p>
<p>Separately, Texas U.S. Rep. Ronny Jackson said in a statement Sunday
that his nephew was injured but “thankfully his injury was not
serious.”</p>
<p>“My family was sitting in the front, near where the President was
speaking,” Jackson said. “They heard shots ringing out — my nephew then
realized he had blood on his neck and something had grazed and cut his
neck. He was treated by the providers in the medical tent.”</p>
<p>The Secret Service said it killed the suspected shooter, who attacked
from an elevated position outside the rally venue.</p>
<p>The former president was showing off a chart of border-crossing
numbers when at least five shots were fired. Trump was seen holding his
ear and got down on the ground. Agents quickly huddled in a shield
around him. When he stood, his face bloodied, he pumped his fist to
cheering supporters as he was whisked off stage by Secret Service
agents.</p>
<p>Trump later extended his condolences to Comperatore’s family.</p>
<p>Randy Reamer, president of the Buffalo Township volunteer fire
company, called Comperatore “a stand-up guy” and “a true brother of the
fire service.” He said Comperatore served as chief of the company for
about three years but was also a life member, meaning he had served for
more than 20 years.</p>
<p>“Just a great all-around guy, always willing to help someone out,”
Reamer said of Comperatore. “He definitely stood up for what he believed
in, never backed down to anyone. … He was a really good guy.”</p>
<p>A crew was power-washing the front of the Buffalo Township Volunteer
Fire Company on Sunday with plans to install memorial drapery to honor
the slain former chief.</p>
<p>Assistant Chief Ricky Heasley of Sarver, who knew Comperatore for
more than a decade, remembered him as very outgoing and full of
life.</p>
<p>“He never had a bad word,” Heasley said.</p>
<p>And in the front yard of the Comperatores’ two-story home in Butler
County, a small memorial had sprung up of a U.S. flag and small bunches
of flowers.</p>
<p>For Morehouse, Comperatore’s death was an emotional blow — but it
also has inspired political action. Morehouse says he plans on casting a
ballot for the first time in his life come November and he plans on
checking Trump’s name.</p>
<p>“As soon as I heard what happened and then learned that it was to
Corey, I went upstairs as soon as I got home and I registered to vote,”
Morehouse said. “This is the first time I’ve ever voted, and I think it
will be in his memory.”</p>
<p>A GoFundMe launched to support Comperatore’s family had surpassed
more than $480,000 in donations as of Sunday.</p>

in somber Oval Office address, calls for unity and peace after Trump
shooting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>White House — President Joe Biden on Sunday summoned the full
gravitas of the Oval Office to entreat Americans to unify and shun
political violence after a stunning attempt on the life of rival Donald
Trump a day earlier – amid fears that more political troubles are ahead
as the nation hurtles toward the November presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump is in Milwaukee ahead of the Republican National Convention,
where he is expected to clinch the Republican presidential nomination.
He made similar calls.</p>
<p>Trump stood up seconds after a shooter attempted to take his life at
a Pennsylvania rally on Saturday. But as Biden acknowledged Sunday, in a
live address to the nation from behind the massive desk that has come to
symbolize American power, this is no mere flesh wound. He urged unity
and reminded Americans that their power comes through the ballot – not
the bullet.</p>
<p>“My fellow Americans,” he began, “I want to speak to you tonight
about the need for us to lower the temperature in our politics and to
remember, while we may disagree, we’re not enemies. We’re neighbors,
we’re friends, coworkers, citizens, and most importantly, we’re fellow
Americans, we must stand together. Yesterday’s shooting at Donald
Trump’s rally in Pennsylvania calls on all of us to take a step back.
Take stock of where we are, and how we go forward from here.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, speaking from another room of the White House, he
urged Americans to not jump to conclusions as law enforcement
investigates the shooting.</p>
<p>“I urge everyone – everyone – please don’t make assumptions about his
motive or his affiliations,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Also Sunday, the White House announced that Biden would not travel
Monday to Texas, as previously planned. The campaign had said Saturday
that they were working to temporarily suspend campaign messaging and
take down ads.</p>
<p>Biden had abruptly returned to Washington early Sunday to receive
briefings on the event and its aftermath. He and Vice President Kamala
Harris spent much of the morning in the White House Situation Room with
Homeland Security and law enforcement officials, according to a White
House photo.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Biden said Trump is “doing well and recovering”
and that he had taken steps to direct the Secret Service to provide
Trump with “every resource, capability and protective measure necessary
to ensure his continued safety.”</p>
<p>Biden said that he instructed the elite law enforcement agency to
review all security measures – “all security measures,” he repeated for
emphasis – as the Republican National Convention begins.</p>
<p>Trump has also called for unity.</p>
<p>“In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand united,
and show our true character as Americans, remaining strong and
determined, and not allowing evil to win,” he posted on his social media
site, Truth Social, on Sunday.</p>
<p>And on Sunday, former first lady Melania Trump issued a plea for
Americans to “ascend above the hate, the vitriol, and the simple-minded
ideas that ignite violence.”</p>
<p>Analysts say that Trump’s defiance in the face of death – seen in
widely circulated images of him rising just seconds after dropping down,
and angrily waving his fist in the air as blood ran from his right ear
while his bodyguards attempted to shield him – will have an effect.</p>
<p>“It will have a huge impact on this election, and on our politics
more broadly,” said Casey Burgat, director of legislative affairs at the
George Washington University.</p>
<p>“History suggests we’re likely to see a rally-around-the-Trump
effect, where those that were in his camp will be even more in his camp.
And then those who just can’t stomach the political violence, for those
who face a reality check of just how dangerous our political rhetoric
has become and sees this manifestation of violence play out before our
very eyes, it’s going to have an impact on this election.”</p>
<p>Trump’s backers say the grim scene may have taught the nation
something important.</p>
<p>“It was both a really terrible day for American democracy, but in a
lot of ways it was also a great day,” said Alex Gray, chief of staff in
Trump’s White House National Security Council, saying it shows the
strength and the frailty of American institutions “I think whether you
support President Trump or you don’t support President Trump, I think
what everyone should take away from that is that American democracy is a
lot bigger and a lot more resilient than too many people give it credit
for.”</p>
<p>Some analysts say they fear more trouble as the two major parties
hold conventions this summer. Chicago hosts the Democratic National
Convention in August.</p>
<p>“I have argued elsewhere that we are very likely to see political
violence across the spectrum in this election cycle,” said Jacob Ware, a
research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “Obviously, this is
the most serious incident so far. But I don’t think there’s any, any
reason to believe that this will be the last violence that we see.”</p>

quietly updates official lightweight Windows 11 Validation OS ISOs for
24H2</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft has again quietly updated its Validation OS ISOs. In case
you are not familiar with it, Validation OS is an official lightweight
variant of Windows and it is designed for hardware vendors to test,
validate and repair hardware defects. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin I had no
idea this variant of Windows existed, but it kind of makes sense when
you think about it. OEMs or other companies making devices that run or
work with Windows may need to test, reboot, test, reboot, and so on,
endlessly, and having a lightweight and fast version of Windows that
doesn’t load any junk you don’t need – or just loads straight into your
company’s hardware testing application – is incredibly valuable.
According to Microsoft, the Windows Validation OS boots to a command
line that allows you to run Win32 applications. This has made me wonder
if I can use it for the one thing I am forced to use Windows for:
playing League of Legends (I cobbled together a spare parts machine
solely for this purpose). My guess is that either the Validation OS will
lack certain components or frameworks League of Legends requires, or is
so different from regular Windows that it will trip Riot Games’ rootkit,
or both. Still, I’m curious. I might load this up on a spare hard drive
and what’s possible.</p>

<h2 id="github-is-starting-to-feel-like-legacy-software">GitHub is
starting to feel like legacy software</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>The corporate branding, the new “AI-powered developer platform”
slogan, makes it clear that what I think of as “GitHub”—the traditional
website, what are to me the core features—simply isn’t Microsoft’s
priority at this point in time. I know many talented people at GitHub
who care, but the company’s priorities just don’t seem to value what I
value about the service. This isn’t an anti-AI statement so much as a
recognition that the tool I still need to use every day is past its
prime. Copilot isn’t navigating the website for me, replacing my need to
the website as it exists today. I’ve had tools hit this phase of decline
and turn it around, but I’m not optimistic. It’s still plenty usable
now, and probably will be for some years to come, but I’ll want to know
what other options I have now rather than when things get worse than
this. ↫ Misty De Meo Apparently, GitHub is in the middle of a long,
drawn-out process where it’s rewriting its frontend using React. De Meo
was trying to use a particular feature of GitHub – the blame view, which
also works through the command line but is apparently much harder to
parse there – and realised the browser search feature just couldn’t find
the line of code they absolutely knew for sure was there. After
scrolling for a while, the browser search feature suddenly found the
line of code. I’d heard rumblings that GitHub’s in the middle of
shipping a frontend rewrite in React, and I realized this must be it.
The problem wasn’t that the line I wanted wasn’t on the page—it’s that
the whole document wasn’t being rendered at once, so my browser’s
builtin search bar just couldn’t find it. On a hunch, I tried disabling
JavaScript entirely in the browser, and suddenly it started working
again. GitHub is able to send a fully server-side rendered version of
the page, which actually works like it should, but doesn’t do so unless
JavaScript is completely unavailable. ↫ Misty De Meo Seem like a classic
case of people being told to develop something in too little time, with
the wrong tools, while management is breathing down their necks and
pulling engineers away to work on buzzwords like “AI”.</p>

<h2 id="new-information-emerges-on-trump-shooting-suspect">New
information emerges on Trump shooting suspect</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — As federal investigators try to piece together a motive
for 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, the man identified as the
would-be assassin of former President Donald Trump, they are finding
more questions than answers.</p>
<p>FBI officials cautioned Sunday the investigation is still in the
early stages but said that the information they have so far been able to
uncover has failed to turn up any reason Crooks decided to take aim from
a rooftop overlooking the campaign rally.</p>
<p>“We do have some limited insights into recent communications that
he’s made texts and phone call detail information that thus far has not
revealed anything with regard to motive for the involvement or knowledge
of anyone else in this,” FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told
reporters.</p>
<p>Other officials say it appears Crooks was acting alone. And they said
while they have yet to crack the password and gain access to his mobile
phone, his social media activity gives little indication of any
ideology.</p>
<p>Discord, a social media platform popular with gamers, said Sunday it
had discovered an account “that appears to be linked to” Crooks, and
appeared to back the FBI’s conclusions.</p>
<p>“It was rarely utilized, has not been used in months,” a Discord
spokesperson confirmed in a statement to VOA. “We have found no evidence
that it was used to plan this incident, promote violence, or discuss his
political views.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, some of those who knew Crooks have started speaking
out.</p>
<p>Jason Kohler told reporters Sunday that he attended high school with
Crooks in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, describing him as a loner and an
outcast.</p>
<p>“He was, like a kid that was always alone. He was always bullied,”
Kohler told reporters Sunday. “He was bullied so much.”</p>
<p>Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High School in 2022, according to a
statement from the school district to a local media outlet. Local media
reports show he was given a $500 award for math and science.</p>
<p>Kohler said he never had much interaction with Crooks, who noted
would sit alone during lunch and often was targeted by other kids for
the way he often wore hunting outfits or how he continued to wear a mask
after COVID mask mandates ended.</p>
<p>“You could look at him and you would be like, ‘something’s a little
off,’” Kohler observed.</p>
<p>The description is just part of the picture that is starting to
emerge of Crooks, who was shot and killed by U.S. Secret Service agents
after climbing to the roof of a building and firing five to six shots at
Trump during a campaign rally Saturday in nearby Butler,
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Law enforcement officials said Sunday they found a rudimentary bomb
in Crooks’s car and home, and that the AR-style rifle he used in the
shooting had been purchased by his father.</p>
<p>Crooks’s father, Matthew Crooks, told CNN late Sunday he was trying
to find out “what the hell is going on” but would “wait until I talk to
law enforcement” before saying anything more.</p>
<p>Public records show Thomas Crooks had no prior convictions and was a
registered Republican, like Trump. </p>
<p>And FBI officials said prior to the attempted assassination, Crooks
had never been brough to the attention of law enforcement.</p>
<p>Officials also said they have so far not found any indications Crooks
suffered from mental health issues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon said Sunday it determined Crooks had no
connection to the U.S. military.</p>
<p>“We’ve confirmed with each of the military service branches that
there is no military service affiliation for the suspect with that name
or date of birth in any branch, active or reserve component in their
respective databases,” according to a statement from the Pentagon press
secretary, Major General Pat Ryder. </p>

<h2 id="motive-still-a-mystery-in-attempted-trump-assassination">Motive
still a mystery in attempted Trump assassination</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — More than 24 hours after a lone gunman tried to
assassinate former U.S. President Donald Trump, the shooter’s
motivations remain a mystery.</p>
<p>FBI agents have descended on Butler, a small city in a rural part of
western Pennsylvania trying to piece together why 20-year-old Thomas
Matthew Crooks climbed to the top of a roof overlooking a Trump campaign
rally and fired multiple shots, injuring the former president, while
killing one spectator and critically injuring two more.</p>
<p>Officials said late Sunday they are treating Saturday’s shooting both
as an attempted assassination and as a domestic terrorism incident,
adding that while investigators have been able to gain “limited
insights” into Crooks’ recent communications, the calls and texts have
yet to shed light on why he chose to act.</p>
<p>“Our number one goal here is to identify the motive of the subject
and determine whether he had any other associates or anyone else that
was involved at this point,” FBI Special Agent-in-Charge Kevin Rojek
told reporters during a phone briefing Sunday.</p>
<p>“It appears that he was a lone actor,” Rojek said. “We have not
identified an ideology associated with the subject, but I want to remind
everyone that we’re still very early in this investigation.”</p>
<p>Looking for insight into the shooter</p>
<p>Secret Service agents killed Crooks at the scene, but law enforcement
officials are hoping they may be able to get additional insights
soon.</p>
<p>Along with an AR-style rifle recovered alongside Crooks’ body, they
recovered a mobile phone during a search of Crooks’ vehicle. The phone
has been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for analysis.</p>
<p>Officials are optimistic they will be able to access the contents,
perhaps revealing more about Crooks’ mindset.</p>
<p>“We are working hard to determine the sequence of events related to
the subject and his movements and the hours, days and weeks prior to the
shooting,” Rojek said.</p>
<p>The phone’s contents might help shed light on what officials
described as a rudimentary explosive device, found in Crooks’ car, and
additional explosive material found at his home.</p>
<p>The FBI said Crooks’ family has been cooperating, including the
father, who legally purchased the gun used in the attempted
assassination.</p>
<p>“We do not know specifically how he accessed the weapon and whether
he took it without his father’s knowledge,” Rojek told reporters, adding
the FBI is trying to understand the shooter’s “affinity for weapons and
how much, if any, times he went to the range.”</p>
<p>Officials said they scoured Crooks’ social media account, which so
far has shown no indications of threatening language. Crooks had not
previously been brought to the FBI’s attention and there are no
indications he suffered from any mental health issues.</p>
<p>Ongoing probe</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were
briefed on the investigation earlier Sunday.</p>
<p>“There is no place in America for this kind of violence,” Biden said,
briefly addressing reporters at the White House Sunday afternoon, adding
the attempted assassination “is contrary to everything we stand for as a
nation.”</p>
<p>“I’ve instructed that this investigation be thorough and swift, and
that the investigators will have every resource they need to get this
done,” Biden added.</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray, speaking separately, called the Trump
assassination attempt “absolutely despicable.”</p>
<p>“The men and women of the FBI are working tirelessly to get to the
bottom of what happened,” Wray told reporters. “We will leave no stone
unturned.”</p>
<p>In addition to the ongoing examination of the site of the shooting,
the FBI has been encouraging anyone who has information or may have been
at the rally and took photos or video to contact them.</p>
<p>Officials said they have received more than 2,000 tips, which are all
being analyzed.</p>
<p>Threat landscape</p>
<p>The FBI warned Sunday that while the shooter acted alone, the threat
landscape has become more perilous than before.</p>
<p>“Although the rhetoric regarding threats of violence has already
increased online, we’re seeing that tick up in the aftermath of this
event,” said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate, who warned some
individuals have gone on social media, fanning tensions by pretending to
be the shooter.</p>
<p>Abbate said the FBI is watching for additional streams or chatter
which could indicate threats to the Republican National Convention in
Milwaukee this week or the Democratic National Convention in Chicago
next month.</p>
<p>“We’re also focused on the continuing efforts, which were already
substantial given that their national special security events, on the
upcoming conventions in Chicago and Milwaukee to work with Secret
Service in the lead to play our part in protecting the people and the
facilities and the events there, as well,” he said.</p>
<p>Watch related report by Arash Arabasadi:</p>
<p>Apparent security lapses</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Biden has ordered a separate investigation into
the apparent security lapses that allowed a would-be assassin to get
within shooting range of a former president.</p>
<p>According to witness accounts and videos posted online, the shooter
was seen holding a rifle and crawling up the roof of a nearby building
moments before the shots rang out. Several bystanders could be heard
yelling to get the attention of nearby police.</p>
<p>Some officials also expressed concern that the shooter fired five to
six times before being stopped.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Key lawmakers Sunday labeled the attempted assassination as a
security failure and said they are seeking answers.</p>
<p>“How is it that someone could get on a roof with a superior position,
with a weapon, and attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump?
It’s just unthinkable, unfathomable” said Representative Mike Turner,
the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>“We need to know, is this a protocol failure? Is this a resources
issue? Or is this just a failure of those who were on site that day?”
Turner told CNN, adding his committee had yet to be briefed on the
developments.</p>
<p>Turner also raised concerns about the threat landscape going forwar“I
am with Director Wray of the FBI, where he said we’re at the highest
level, threat level, that we have had since 9/11,” said Turner. “I
believe that the threat is continuing. It’s not just this one
individual’s assassin’s attempt.”</p>
<p>The House Homeland Security Committee chairman, Republican
Representative Mark Green, spoke late Sunday with U.S. Secret Service
Director Kim Cheatle, a committee source told VOA.</p>
<p>The source said Cheatle “committed to providing requested documents
to the Committee promptly,” and plans to brief the entire committee
Monday.</p>
<p>Green “continues to seek answers to the many questions the American
people deserve to know,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Green also sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security,
asking for documents related to the security plan and screening
procedures for the rally and what sort of additional protective measures
had been asked for, or given to, the Trump campaign.</p>

One hundred doesn’t seem a lot in the grand scheme of things, especially on the web. If you have one hundred followers you might as well have zero. One hundred views on a YouTube video? That’s nothing. You need at least one hundred thousand to be part of the conversation. And yet, I find one hundred signatures in a guestbook to be a lot. Can you imagine having one hundred people in front of you, all saying something to you, one after the other? It would feel overwhelming. The internet has messed up many things, including the sense of scale. But this more humane scale is why I love the personal web. You can still recognise the names of the people who interact with you, you can still remember details about them. I’m grateful for every single one of those one hundred signatures.

leaders condemn assassination attempt targeting former US President
Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — Presidents, prime ministers and international
organizations worldwide condemned the political violence and
assassination attempt targeting former U.S. President Donald Trump at a
rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities are still investigating the shooting.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said he spoke with Trump Saturday night in
what Biden described as a short and good conversation. “An assassination
attempt is contrary to everything we stand for as a nation,” Biden told
reporters Sunday.</p>
<p>The State Department declined to comment on private diplomatic
conversations between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his
counterparts. Blinken posted on X, formerly Twitter, that he was
“shocked and saddened” by the shooting at former President Trump’s rally
and grateful that he is safe.</p>
<p>Argentina</p>
<p>Argentine President Javier Milei said in a post on X that the
apparent assassination attempt showed the “desperation of the
international left” and its willingness to “destabilize democracies and
promote violence to screw itself into power.”</p>
<p>Australia</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the “inexcusable
attack” on democratic values.</p>
<p>He told reporters at the Australian Parliament House, “In Australia,
as in the United States, the essence and the purpose of our democracies
is that we can express our views, debate our disagreements and resolve
our differences peacefully.”</p>
<p>Bangladesh</p>
<p>The prime minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, condemned the

there?” she asked.</p>

<p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, in a pinned social
media post, said that the shooting during the campaign rally is
unacceptable and must be “vehemently repudiated” by all defenders of
democracy.</p>
<p>His predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, a close ally of Trump, expressed
solidarity with what he called “the world’s greatest leader of the
moment.” Bolsonaro was stabbed in the abdomen at a campaign event ahead
of the 2018 presidential election, which he won.</p>
<p>Canada</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his dismay at the
shooting, saying his thoughts were with Trump, those at the event and
all Americans.</p>
<p>“It cannot be overstated — political violence is never acceptable,”
he wrote on X.</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement that President Xi
Jinping has expressed sympathies to Trump and that China is following
the shooting incident.</p>
<p>Djibouti</p>
<p>Djibouti President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh “vehemently” denounced the
“reprehensible and alarming assassination attempt” on Trump. He wrote on
X, “Political violence is a grave threat to global stability, must be
unequivocally condemned and outlawed.”</p>

condemnation of the attack in a statement and wished for the U.S.
election campaigns to resume peacefully.</p>

“despicable” and “such acts of violence threaten democracy.” He said his
thoughts are with all those who were affected.</p>
<p>Greece</p>
<p>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed his shock at the
attack on Trump. “Political violence is unacceptable in our democratic
societies,” he wrote on X.</p>

and standards. </p>

prayers were with Trump “in these dark hours.”</p>

wrote on X that he and his wife were “shocked by the apparent attack” on
Trump and prayed for Trump’s safety and speedy recovery.</p>
<p>At the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem, Netanyahu
said he watched “in horror,” adding that the attack was also an
“assassination attempt on American democracy.”</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>Italian President Sergio Mattarella said in a statement the attack
was a cause for serious alarm and “a disconcerting symptom of the
deterioration of the civil fabric and of the dangerous refusal of
confrontation, dialogue and respect for democratic life.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni wished Trump a quick
recovery.</p>

“Nigeria stands in solidarity with the United States of America at this
time.”</p>
<p>Organization of American States</p>
<p>Luis Almagro, secretary-general of the Organization of American
States, said he condemned “in the strongest terms” the attack against
Trump. “Violence has absolutely no place in an election, in politics or
in our societies,” he wrote on X.</p>
<p>Pakistan</p>
<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif described the shooting as a
“shocking development,” condemning all forms of political violence and
wishing Trump a swift recovery and good health.</p>
<p>Imprisoned Pakistani opposition leader and former Prime Minister
Imran Khan, who was shot and injured at a rally in November 2022, wished
Trump a full recovery. “Political violence is a tool of cowards and has
no place in a democracy,” he said on X.</p>
<p>Philippines</p>
<p>Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. wrote on X, “It
is with great relief that we receive the news that former President

always remain supreme,” Marcos added.</p>
<p>Russia</p>

Trump, according to Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.</p>

administration was responsible for Saturday’s assassination attempt on

administration “during the political struggle.”</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses its condemnation and

“all forms of violence.”</p>
<p>Singapore</p>
<p>The prime minister of Singapore, Lawrence Wong, said he was relieved
to hear reports that Trump is safe and recovering well. Wong wrote on X,
“We should never resort to violence regardless of any differences of
views.”</p>
<p>South Africa</p>
<p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa wrote on X that the attempted
assassination “is a stark reminder of the dangers of political extremism
and intolerance.”</p>
<p>Ramaphosa also voiced his hope that “the citizens and leaders of
America will have the fortitude and sagacity to reject violence and seek
peaceful solutions.”</p>

<p>Slovakia</p>
<p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who survived an assassination
attempt in May, condemned the shooting. In a Facebook post, Fico drew a
direct comparison between the two incidents and suggested that the
attack on Trump was “scripted like through a copybook,” implying it was
orchestrated by Trump’s political opponents.</p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, said on X his thoughts and prayers

describing it as “a criminal and extremist act.”</p>
<p>United Kingdom</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on X that he was appalled by
the “shocking scenes,” and sent his best wishes to Trump and his
family.</p>
<p>“Political violence in any form has no place in our societies,” he
said.</p>
<p>British lawmaker Nigel Farage, who is a friend of Trump, sought to
place much of the blame on the “mainstream media,” which he claimed
opposed the former U.S. president. Speaking to the BBC, he described the
incident as “horrendous,” although he said he was not entirely surprised
by it.</p>
<p>Uzbekistan</p>
<p>President Shavkat Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan, in a post on Telegram,
strongly condemned the attack and the act of violence. He wished Trump a
speedy recovery.</p>
<p>The Vatican</p>
<p>The Vatican press office released a statement on Sunday expressing
concern about the violence, which it said, “wounds people and democracy,
causing suffering and death.” The statement added that the Holy See is
“united in the prayer of the U.S. bishops for America, for the victims,
and for peace in the country, so that the motives of the violent may
never prevail.”</p>
<p>Venezuela</p>
<p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro condemned the attack during a

id="race-is-on-to-keep-150-year-old-lighthouse-from-crumbling-into-hudson-river">Race
is on to keep 150-year-old lighthouse from crumbling into Hudson
River</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HUDSON, N.Y. — Wooden pilings beneath Hudson-Athens Lighthouse are
deteriorating, and the structure, built in the middle of the river when
steamboats still plied the water, is beginning to shift. Cracks are
apparent on the brick building and its granite foundation.</p>
<p>While there are other endangered lighthouses around the nation, the
peril to this one 100 miles 161 (kilometers) north of New York City is
so dire the National Trust for Historic Preservation placed
Hudson-Athens on its 2024 list of the country’s 11 most endangered
historic places. Advocates say that if action isn’t taken soon, yet
another historic lighthouse could be lost in the coming years.</p>
<p>“All four corners will begin to come down, and then you’ll have a
pile of rock in the middle. And ultimately it will topple into the
river,” Van Calhoun of the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse Preservation Society
said during a recent visit.</p>
<p>The society is trying to quickly raise money to place a submerged
steel curtain around the lighthouse, an ambitious preservation project
that could cost as much as $10 million. Their goal is to save a
prominent symbol of the river’s centuries-long history as a busy
waterway. While the Hudson River was once home to more than a dozen
lighthouses, only seven still stand.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there’s a similar story of lost history.</p>
<p>Across the United States, there were around 1,500 lighthouses at the
beginning of the 20th century. Only about 800 of them remain, said U.S.
Lighthouse Society executive director Jeff Gales. He said many of the
structures deteriorated after they were automated, a process that became
more common by the 1940s.</p>
<p>“Lighthouses were built to have human beings taking care of them,”
Gales said. “And when you seal them up and take the human factor out,
that’s when they really start falling into disrepair.”</p>
<p>The Hudson-Athens Lighthouse began operating in 1874 offshore from
the city of Hudson and was eventually co-named for the village of Athens
on the other side of the river. It was built to help keep boats from
running aground on nearby mud flats, which were submerged at high
tide.</p>
<p>“There were shipwrecks because they couldn’t see the sandbar. And so
that’s why this lighthouse was put in the middle of the river, unlike
most that are on the shoreline,” said preservation society president
Kristin Gamble.</p>
<p>The lighthouse is still in use, though now with an automated LED
beacon. The preservation society owns the building and maintains it as a
museum.</p>
<p>The last full-time keeper, Emil Brunner, retired in 1949 when the
lighthouse became automated. He lived there with his family for much of
his tenure. One of his daughters recalled rowing to school and, in the
winter, walking across the ice on a safe path marked by her father’s
tobacco juice stains on the frozen surface. Brunner also is portrayed on
a 1946 Saturday Evening Post cover painting rowing with a child,
Christmas presents and a tree in tow, as his wife and other children
await their arrival on the lighthouse landing.</p>
<p>Visitors who are ferried to the lighthouse today can explore the
keeper’s quarters, which are modest but feature river views from every
window. And they can climb up the tight spiral staircase to the tower to
take in a unique panorama view of the river and the Catskill Mountains
to the west.</p>
<p>Roof work on the lighthouse is underway this summer, but repairs to
the building will ultimately mean little unless workers address damage
to some of the 200 wood pilings packed in mud that hold the lighthouse
above water. The support structure has weathered 150 years of currents
and ice. But large commercial ships of the modern era — with their big
propellors — introduce new problems.</p>
<p>“They create a turbulence that’s like being inside a washing machine.
And that turbulence actually comes underneath and pulls — churns up —
the soil underneath us and sucks it away,” Calhoun said. “In fact, there
are boulders as big as your car that are 100 feet out in that river that
used to be right next to us.”</p>
<p>The underwater agitation washes away mud around the pilings, leaving
them exposed to water. And that accelerates decay of the wood. Engineers
estimate the structure could begin to tilt in three to five years, which
Gamble said would be “the beginning of the end.”</p>
<p>The proposed ring of corrugated steel would shield the structure from
that turbulence. The 100-foot (31-meter) diameter circle, which would
project above the water line, would be filled in and covered by a deck,
enlarging the area around the lighthouse.</p>
<p>The preservation group is optimistic about getting federal money to
help pay for the project. Both of New York’s U.S. senators, Democrats
Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, support the effort, as does local
Republican U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro.</p>
<p>Though the project is pricey, Gamble said, it would not only save the
lighthouse from being lost to time, but it would also protect the
19th-century beacon for generations to come.</p>
<p>“We need, basically, the 100-year fix,” she said.</p>

<p>The U.S. Republican Party is expected to formally nominate Donald
Trump for president this week, days after he survived an assassination
attempt at a political rally. Already tight security is expected to be
heightened in Milwaukee, which is hosting the Republican National
Convention. VOA’s Jorge Agobian and William Gallo spoke with convention
delegates and Milwaukee residents, who are concerned about the
possibility of more unrest.</p>

nicknamed Apex will be auctioned in New York</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The nearly complete fossilized remains of a
161-million-year-old stegosaurus discovered in Colorado in 2022 will be
auctioned by Sotheby’s in New York next week, auction house officials
said.</p>
<p>The dinosaur that Sotheby’s calls Apex stands 3.3 meters tall and
measures 8.2 meters nose to tail, according to Cassandra Hatton,
Sotheby’s global head of science and popular culture.</p>
<p>The stegosaurus, with its distinctive pointy dorsal plates, is one of
the world’s most recognizable dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Apex, which Hatton called “a coloring book dinosaur,” was discovered
in May 2022 on private land near the town of Dinosaur, Colorado. The
excavation was completed in October 2023, Sotheby’s said.</p>
<p>Though experts believe stegosauruses used their fearsome tail spikes
to fight, this specimen shows no signs of combat, Sotheby’s said. The
fossil does show evidence of arthritis, suggesting that Apex lived to an
advanced age.</p>
<p>Hatton said Apex was found “with the tail curled up underneath the
body, which is a common death pose for animals.”</p>
<p>The dinosaur will be auctioned on July 17 as part of Sotheby’s “Geek
Week” series.</p>
<p>Sotheby’s is estimating that it will sell for $4 million to $6
million, but that’s just an educated guess.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly rare animal,” Hatton said. “A stegosaurus of
this caliber has never sold at auction before, so we will find out what
it is actually worth.”</p>

Now that <a href="/2024/05/refurb-weekend-canon-cat.html">our 1987 Canon

time to get into the operating system and pull some tricks.

</div>
As you’ll recall <a href="/2024/05/refurb-weekend-canon-cat.html">from
our historical discussion of the Canon Cat</a>, the Cat was designed by
Jef Raskin as a sophisticated user-centric computer but demoted to
office machine within Canon’s typewriter division, which was tasked with
selling it. Because Canon only ever billed the Cat as a “work processor”
for documents and communications, and then abruptly tanked it after just
six months, it never had any software packages that were commercially
produced. In fact, I can’t find <em>any</em> software written for it
other than the original Tutor and Demo diskettes included with the
system and a couple of
<a href="https://randoc.wordpress.com/2020/02/23/a-few-remarks-on-the-canon-cat/">Canon-specific
utilities</a>, which I don’t have and don’t seem to be imaged anywhere.
<p>
So this entry will cover a lot of ground: first, we have to be able to
reliably read, image and write Canon disks on another system, then
decipher the format, and <em>then</em> patch those images to display
pictures and automatically run arbitrary code. At the end we’ll have
three examples we can image on any PC 3.5” floppy drive and insert into
a Cat, turn it on or hit DISK, and have the Cat automatically run: a Jef
Raskin “picture disk,” a simple but useful dummy terminal, and the
world’s first (I believe) Canon Cat, two-disk, slightly animated and
finely dithered, slideshow graphics demo!
<p>
But before we get to pumping out floppy disks, we first need to talk
about how one uses a Cat. And that means we need to talk a bit about
Forth, the Canon Cat’s native tongue. And that means we should probably
talk more about the operating system too. Oh, and we should go down to
CompUSA and buy a brand new floppy drive while we’re at it.
<p>
<p><a name='more'></a></p>
For those of you without a Cat, which sadly will be most of you, at
least a little of this entry can be done in MAME, which is at present
the sole extant Cat emulator. (A Wasm version with ROMs ready to go is
<a href="https://archive.org/details/canoncat">at the Internet
Archive</a>, though here I’ll be running it on my Raptor Talos II in
Fedora.) Unfortunately MAME emulates neither the internal disk drive nor
the serial port, so you won’t be able to run these demos on it yet, and
there’s a couple glitches we need to work around, but this will still
give you a flavour of the machine and let you poke around a bit.
<p>
Everything in this entry assumes the production v1.74 ROMs, which were
to the best of my knowledge the only version mass-produced Cats were
ever officially shipped with. Source code and binaries for v2.40 ROMs
exist but my Cat doesn’t run them. If you want to run the v2.40 ROMs
anyway, don’t be surprised if some of this doesn’t work right, and I’m
very sure the demos won’t.
<p>
<p>The major glitches to rectify are the emulator freezing when the
beeper is triggered (probably incomplete emulation of one of the custom
Canon gate array chips) and switching the keyboard layout so we can type
angle brackets (unpossible with the default US layout, also true of a
real Cat). Let’s fix those issues first.</p>

<p>The Cat’s interface is entirely keyboard-driven with no mouse,
joystick or even cursor keys. To perform special functions, the USE
FRONT key acts like a Command or Control key when combined with others.
Here, we’ll enter the setup menu by holding down USE FRONT (in the
default MAME key layout, this is probably Control) and pressing SETUP,
which is usually the left brace key. <em>Keep USE FRONT/Control

The two settings we’ll want to change are the keyboard and problem
signal. The keyboard is most likely set to United States (or as
appropriate to your own locale), but we’ll need it set to true ASCII for
hacking purposes. With USE FRONT/Control still down, repeatedly tap
either of the LEAP keys (usually mapped to Alt/Option) to cycle through
the choices until “ASCII” is shown. If you started at United States, tap
the left LEAP/Alt/Option key for Dvorak and again for ASCII, and that
should do it, but <em>do not let go of USE FRONT/Control yet.</em>
<p>
Then, to change the problem signal, <em>with USE FRONT/Control still
down</em>, tap SPACE twice to move to that, and tap LEAP until “Flash”
is shown (and only flash, none of the beep options). Your screen should
look like the grab above. Assuming it does, <em>now</em> you can let go
of USE FRONT. After a brief pause the settings will be written to the
battery-backed settings RAM and the Cat will go back to the main
document.
<p>
So that you understand what we’ll be trying to accomplish (and,
eventually, subvert), let’s have a quick look at what makes the Cat’s
interface unique.
<p>

A tour of the Cat

The Cat’s operating system is entirely in ROM, so there’s no waiting to
start — though if you have a disk in the drive, and the machine
generally expects you will so that your workspace can be autosaved, it
will load when you power it on. Either way, you can start entering text
almost immediately. What looks like two cursors will track your typing,
but what they really are is the selection (inverse video) and the
insertion point (grey block). The selection is what is deleted
immediately by pressing ERASE (backspace).
<p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen is the <i>ruler</i>. This shows your
document margins and your tab stops, though in characters, not inches —
the Cat uses fixed-width, non-proportional characters. Paragraph style,
line spacing and the keyset in use (I or II, for those keys with
multiple character pairs assigned to them) are at the bottom, along with
a memory usage gauge and the current line number within the current
document.</p>

<p>The Cat doesn’t have a filesystem, nor even a concept of one.
Instead, all documents are subsumed into one big overarching workspace,
each workspace being identified by a unique key stored to its matching
disk (so that you can’t overwrite a disk with the wrong workspace, and
you won’t lose unsaved text with a new disk — that is, unless you force
it to do those things). Disk and memory permitting, you can create as
many documents as you like with the DOCUMENT/PAGE (typically Page Down)
key. They can be individually titled so you can scan the list to see
what’s present, and carry their own independent margin and document
settings. The Cat was never shipped with a memory capacity greater than
what its floppy drive could store, so one disk always equals one
workspace.</p>

How do you navigate without cursor keys or a mouse? The LEAP keys, when
held down, search either backwards (left) or forwards (right) in the
workspace based on what you type. You can LEAP by characters, or
paragraphs (LEAP to RETURN or RETURN-RETURN), or even documents
(LEAP-DOCUMENT). SHIFT-LEAP can be used to scroll the screen line by
line.
<p>
<p>LEAPing also is how you mark text. If you LEAP first to the beginning
of a block of text and then LEAP to the end of it, then press both LEAP
keys, that text is selected. Besides applying styles like boldface or
all-caps to it, you can move it by LEAPing elsewhere, or copy it and
move the copy, or delete it. A single level of undo is available with
the UNDO key.</p>

Selecting text has other functions too. When I say everything goes in
the workspace, I do mean <em>everything</em>. The Cat is designed to be
collabourative: you can hook up your Cat to a phone line, or at least
you could when landlines were more ubiquitous, and someone could call in
and literally type into your document remotely. If you dialed up a
service, you would type into the document and mark and send text to the
remote system, and the remote system’s response would also become part
of your document. (That goes for the RS-232 port as well, by the way. In
fact, we’ll deliberately exploit this capability for the projects in
this article.)
<p>
<p>Raskin’s intention was that the document should handle dynamic text
as fluidly as static text (if Canon had let him and the firmware
permitted, this would undoubtedly have been how graphics were handled
also), and that such text should be computable on the fly. Let’s compute
my favourite easy-to-remember approximation of π. Type <tt>355/113</tt>
and highlight it with the LEAP keys: hold down LEAP LEFT and type 3
(jumps to the first three), then hold down LEAP RIGHT and type 3 again
(jumps to the last three), then press both LEAP keys.</p>

<p>We can now tap USE FRONT-CALC (the G key), a little CALC icon will
briefly appear, and suddenly the result of the computation is displayed:
3.14. (The Cat defaults to two decimal digits of displayed precision but
this is configurable.) The dotted line underneath it indicates it is a
generated value.</p>

<p>That’s handy as a desk calculator, and the syntax supports operator
precedence and parentheses as well as functions like <tt>sqrt</tt>, but
the really fun part is when we use this to store values in memory. Let’s
define a variable <tt>pi</tt> with the same calculation
<tt>355/113</tt>. We enter <tt>pi:355/113</tt> and then highlight it
with the LEAP keys (leap left to the <tt>p</tt>, leap right to the
<tt>3</tt>, then with LEAP RIGHT still held down press USE FRONT-LEAP
RIGHT to leap again to the second three, then with LEAP RIGHT still held
down tap LEAP LEFT and finally release both keys).</p>

And thus our <tt>pi<em>radius</em>radius</tt> duly changes as well. If
we changed the name of the variable or entered other nonsense or did
something like divide by zero, the Cat will calmly display question
marks to indicate any dependent result is invalid, and you can edit the
expression with CALC again to fix it.
<p>
<p>This process can be slow if there are lots of things to compute, and
the 5MHz 68K isn’t exactly a speed demon. Pressing any key while the
CALC icon is displayed will cancel the operation, true for any such task
including printing except DISK (for obvious reasons) and one more to be

Does this sound a little like a spreadsheet? I’m so glad you asked!
Because Cat text is fixed-width, setting up consistent rows and columns
is simply a matter of tab stops and character width, adjusting the
document margins if necessary. Tabs separate cells and the editor treats
them as such with the function <tt>use()</tt>.
<p>
<p>Let’s enter a simple spreadsheet where we will compute the tax on a
sale of widgets and then total the transaction. We’ll specify unit price
and number sold, and compute a fixed tax of 10% (though this could just
as easily be a variable). There are two tab stops between the Unit Price
and the Sales, so the expression becomes
<tt>use(-3)<em>use(-1)</em>0.10</tt> to compute unit price times sales
times 10%.</p>

<p>Even though the unit price and sales count are simply plain text we
entered and didn’t originate as computed values, we can still change
them and press CALC to recalculate the miniature spreadsheet. If we
wanted to address a different <em>row</em>, we add a second argument to
<tt>use()</tt> for the Y delta (such as <tt>use(-1 1)</tt> for the value
in the next row but the previous column; the arguments to the function
are separated by spaces). All of your variables and expressions are
saved to disk as part of the document.</p>

It would be a gross distortion to say every nuance of the Cat is
discoverable and/or self-explanatory. In fact, some procedural aspects
of it, while sensible once you learn them, are not at all obvious.
<p>
<p>But there is ample online help if you hold down USE FRONT/Control and
press HELP (by default the N key). This is the default screen if there
is no pending error state. If there were an error, such as a problem
reading the disk, the Cat will beep politely and pressing USE FRONT-HELP
will instead explain the error in prose. (Raskin hated modals.)</p>

<h3>
Sallying tForth into the ROM
</h3>
<p>
<p>Anyway, except for that easter egg, everything you saw was what Canon
wanted you to see — a sophisticated word processor. But what Jef Raskin
wanted you to see, and Canon didn’t, was a general-purpose computer that
just happened to use a word processor-like primary interface, complete
with a built-in programming language. That language is Forth, as
descended from <a href="/2024/05/refurb-weekend-canon-cat.html">the
original Swyft</a>, or more accurately tForth, an implementation using
tokens (the “t”) instead of direct addresses for each <i>word</i> in a
word definition. This requires a level of indirection to look up the
execution address when a word is executed, a semantic difference between
this concept and a bytecode approach, but it also means that words can
be redefined or even deleted without leaving stale pointers in unrelated
words that reference them. More importantly, code can be considerably
more compact because tokens don’t necessarily need to be the size of an
entire address (Cat tokens are byte-sized, though often taken as
word-sized groups) and the code they reference can be moved and
compacted. This was important given the 256K of memory the Cat shipped
with, which wasn’t a huge amount even in the mid-1980s and had to be
shared with the video circuitry.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, although officially undocumented, a gateway to Forth
remains in the Cat. It is triggered by a straightforward — albeit
unlikely — series of keystrokes, which works in both MAME and the real
hardware. Start out by typing <tt>Enable Forth Language</tt> (easiest in
a blank document or workspace).</p>

Lock this change in by typing the magic incantation <tt>-1 wheel!

it to battery-backed settings RAM, then returns to the editor. Now the
Forth mode is unlocked, and the hacking can begin. In future you won’t
need to do the “Enable Forth Language” dance again as long as your
settings RAM or battery doesn’t get whacked.
<p>
<p>Forth is accessed in two ways, one of which you just saw for entering
commands at a traditional REPL-like prompt. This is the mode we will
primarily be using, and is fully supported by the operating system, but
the other fashion is clearly more Raskinesque. Remember how you could
highlight expressions and have the Cat compute them?</p>

Well, <em>now</em> that works for Forth, but instead of USE FRONT-CALC,
you’ll use USE FRONT-ANSWER. This article will not seek to teach you
Forth (the
<a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/0-starting-forth/">online
version of <i>Starting Forth</i></a> is a far better instructional tool
than I could ever write), and I certainly do not profess to have
superior fluency in it myself. However, for illustrative purposes I’ll
be using relatively simple code that most people should be able to grok
at a conceptual level. Just remember that since Forth is the canonical
stack language, everything gets pushed and popped to stacks, and as such
control structures and arithmetic appear “backwards” compared to other
programming languages. (Forth’s famous use of reverse Polish notation is
thus simply a logical consequence of the language.)
<p>
<p>In any event, upon pressing USE FRONT-ANSWER …</p>

Interestingly, if you try to ask the online help for information on the
ANSWER key, you just get the ERASE key help page no matter what you do.
ANSWER isn’t even referenced in the user manual. While ANSWER does
appear on the front of the key just like any other key you can USE FRONT
with, it does nothing until you enable Forth, and many or even most of
its contemporary users likely never pondered what it was there for.

This is tForth for “I don’t know that word.” Forth has a reputation as a
language so close to the metal that one wrong move will bring the system
down. I’ve personally experienced that writing for the 68K Mac in Pocket
Forth, where unbalancing the stack can lead to a system error faster
than you can say guru meditation. Yes, Forth programmers are Real Men,
Manly Men, Speakers of the One True Manly Language, Men on the Bleeding
Edge, who point and laugh uproariously at you toddling along with your
IDE and your wussy little C compiler. (Or womenly women, or neither.
This blog is totes egalitarian.)
<p>
<p>So here’s a little warning: tForth is not nearly that hostile, but
while it may have more guardrails than the typical Forth implementation,
that’s not saying very much. Although the ROM is relatively resistant to
rookie mistakes and I’m not aware of anything that can permanently brick
the logic board, you <em>can</em> damage things (like getting the track
and address transposed when you command the disk drive to seek!), you
<em>can’t</em> interrupt a Forth operation if you inadvertently cause an
infinite loop, you <em>can</em> freely trash the system and anything in
memory, and you <em>can</em> lock up the system so severely that nothing
will fix it but a powercycle. To borrow
<a href="http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/a-constructive-look-at-templeos/">a
quote from Terry A. Davis</a>, tForth “is a motorbike. If you lean over
too far, you’ll fall off. Don’t do that.” This particular minefield
won’t blow off your arms, but it might throw you on the ground pretty
hard.</p>

Anyway, we’ll return to our previous example and do some more messing
around in MAME before we switch over to the real system. Press SHIFT-USE
FRONT-SPACE and type the Forth word <tt>page</tt> to both clear the
screen and home the cursor (<tt>cls home</tt> also works).
<p>
I should note parenthetically that on a real Cat you can soft-reset the
system by typing <tt>cold</tt> at the <tt>ok</tt> prompt. It’s very
handy for reducing wear on the power switch, but doesn’t seem to work in
MAME.
<p>
<p>A fair bit of the fundamentals on which this article is based come
from the copious technical documentation on the platform, collected and
preserved at <a href="http://www.canoncat.net/">canoncat.net</a>. Some
of it actually hails from the Swyft’s development, but the Cat is so
similar to its ancestor that most of their content is still relevant.
We’ll then build on this basis for the tricks we’ll pull.</p>

Here’s the memory map from the Cat tForth manual, which I have marked up
and corrected according to production models. The stock Cat officially
comes with 256K of main memory plus 8K of battery-backed RAM for storing
settings and the user dictionary. This was apparently 16K in earlier
iterations, and is 16K in MAME, but my system just has an 8K SRAM and
only an 8K SRAM is described in the official service manual. 512K is the
greatest amount of RAM supported by the hardware.
<p>
<p>The 256K system ROM is located at the bottom of the address space
with the lowest 1K being the 68K exception vector table, and above that
the battery-backed settings RAM from $040000 to $041fff. The main RAM
starts at $400000, which is also where the 28896-byte (~28K) 672x344
monochrome display bitmap is stored. From $600000 and up is the
memory-mapped I/O range, but we will rarely manipulate those devices
directly.</p>

<p>From the Forth prompt you can do any Forth operation, including
defining new words, though long lines don’t wrap and complex words are
better defined within the editor. Here we’re storing a simple vertical
strip of bytes to video memory as a “hello world” (<tt>20 0 do i i 54 *
400000 + c! loop</tt>). The framebuffer is linear and byte-addressed
with 84 bytes for each 672 pixel line, and is white on black (i.e., set
pixels are white, unset pixels are black). Note that all values
displayed and entered are in hexadecimal by default.</p>

<p>tForth has the concept of <i>vocabularies</i>, which are organized
into a tree and a search order, and the user can define additional ones.
The word <tt>existing</tt> tells us the present vocabularies, which are
<tt>function</tt>, <tt>arithmetic</tt>, <tt>user</tt>, <tt>hidden</tt>
and <tt>forth</tt>, all of which descend from <tt>forth</tt>, which is
the root. As shipped, however, this scheme is not greatly exploited: the
<tt>arithmetic</tt> vocab is completely empty, there are only a handful
of math and stat operations in <tt>function</tt>, and you obviously have
to add your own to <tt>user</tt>. Most of the ROM word action occurs in
<tt>hidden</tt>, which contains the words for the editor (and is hidden
from listings, but are all executable), and in <tt>forth</tt>, from
which all blessings flow. Although sixteen vocabularies may be in play
at any time, it doesn’t look like this capability was ever taken to its
fullest extent.</p>

We’ll mostly deal with the <tt>forth</tt> vocabulary, and the
<tt>new</tt> vocabulary, of course, because we’ll be adding words of our
own. However, the <tt>hidden</tt> vocabulary is absolutely present and
available and you needn’t explicitly open a vocabulary simply to use the
words in it.
<p>
<p>Also, you don’t need to try to read every word on this screen and
extract them from ROM either because I’ve already done it for you. Go
ahead and open up <a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox">the
Github Catbox project</a> and refer to
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/words">the handy
list of words</a>, including everything in the <tt>hidden</tt> vocab.
We’ll be using tools from the Catbox to do more spelunking in the ROM
very shortly.</p>

<p>A couple more things about tForth before we get to talking about the
disk format. The <tt>‘</tt> word (a literal apostrophe, say “tick”)
tells you the token for any word, including words in ROM. As usual for
Forth, all words are (at least initially) executable machine code,
though some words are entirely so. You can use the token to do a lookup
and find where that code begins, or you can use the word <tt>c’</tt>
(“c-tick”) which will do that for you. The lookup is done in the
<i>token table</i>, which exists in RAM and whose location can
potentially vary, though on a 1.74 system the first address reliably
seems to remain at $410400 (not $40ec00 as in the memory map). The token
table gets initialized and copied into RAM as part of startup, making it
possible to patch ROM words if necessary to point to new in-RAM
definitions. <i>Spoiler alert: this will be necessary.</i> Here, we’ve
dumped some of the memory at <tt>cold</tt>’s execution address to
demonstrate it’s written in 68K assembly, as you would expect for
something that cold-starts the machine.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

<p>But not every word in ROM is in assembler, just ones where
performance was important or direct code merely more expedient. The
<tt>save</tt> word, which we’ll be exploring a lot more later on, is
written in tForth. We know this because the first 68K opcode to get
executed is $4ed3 or <tt>jmp (a3)</tt>, calling the address in 68K
register A3, which during tForth execution contains the address for the
<i>nesting</i> routine. This block of native code saves the tForth
equivalent of the return address, computing it as a delta from the
calling word to the new word. It then does some other housekeeping, sets
the new tForth instruction pointer in A5 to the byte after the <tt>jmp
(a3)</tt> and falls through to the very critical <i>next</i> routine
(kept in A4), which grabs the execution address for the next word at the
A5 instruction pointer and jumps into it.</p>

<p>For housekeeping, words in a vocabulary have <i>headers</i>, which
contain an encoded offset into the starting address table and the word’s
ASCII string with a length and flags byte. Only the first 32 bytes of a
word’s ASCII string are considered significant. The header for a word
can ordinarily be obtained with <tt>n’</tt> (“n-tick”) but words in ROM
don’t appear to have one. (In fact, they do, but the routines
intentionally? don’t look at that portion of ROM.)</p>

</div>
However, new words we define certainly have headers, like this more
canonical “hello world” example (<tt>: hello .” hello world” cr ;</tt>).
Here we can see it was given a token, see its execution address
(starting with <tt>jmp (a3)</tt>), and see its header containing the
encoded offset, then the length-and-flags byte, and then the string
<tt>hello</tt>, plus some trailing garbage (the entry ends right after
the string). The encoded offset and flags are mutable and can be changed
later.
<p>
That’s a sufficient understanding of tForth under the hood for what’s
coming up.

<h3>
Reading and writing Cat disks
</h3>
<p>
In <a href="/2024/05/refurb-weekend-canon-cat.html">our previous entry
on the Canon Cat hardware</a>, we shored up the Cat’s internal floppy
drive, which is a Canon-manufactured device specific to it. However, the
disks it uses are ordinary 3.5” floppy disks, and modern low-level
imaging tools can read them in a standard PC drive.
<p>
The basic rudiments of the format have been known for awhile thanks to
Dwight Elvey — if Raskin was the father of the Cat, then Elvey would
surely be its godfather — and
<a href="http://www.canoncat.net/cat/Cat%20Forth%20Inside.txt">his
notes</a> indicate the drive is writing regular 512-byte sectors, 10 per
track and 80 tracks per disk, single-sided. (Atari ST enthusiasts will
find this format familiar. While the ST by default stores only nine
sectors per track, it can store ten, such as on titles such as
<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2016/01/a-pirates-life-for-me-part-3-case-studies-in-copy-protection/">Dungeon
Master</a>.) That’s 400K a disk, and since the Cat only shipped with
256K and had additional RAM sockets only for 384K total, the entirety of
the supported RAM will fit. Both double-density and high-density 3.5”
floppies apparently work, though I have plenty of new-in-box DD floppies
here and we’ll use those.
<p>
<p>Since I wanted nice clean disks written on a good quality drive for
my Cat, I decided to go down to CompUSA and buy a new floppy drive
too.</p>

<p>Yeah, okay, eBay. But while I was looking for a new shrink-wrapped
drive I ran across this NOS CompUSA-boxed floppy drive package with
additional floppy disks and even a cleaning kit. The funny part is I do
remember buying one of these back in the day! I just don’t know where it
went, and I wanted a new one anyhow.</p>

<p>The drive is one of the very common Teac FD-235 series. They are very
easy to find used, and, it turns out, new as well. The disk cleaner kit
went immediately to doing a few cycles on the Cat drive itself even
though the head looked pretty good when I inspected it.</p>

For our disk imaging we’ll use an off-the-hobbyist-shelf and inexpensive
<a href="https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle">Greaseweazle</a>. These
USB-based devices have open source software for Linux, Windows and macOS
and are available from multiple sellers.
<p>
<p>Sadly, here’s where we leave MAME behind, since it doesn’t support
the floppy drive or disk images yet. Remember us typing <tt>Enable Forth
Language</tt>? Let’s make a disk out of that on the real Cat. The DISK
help screen looks like this:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

</div>
In short terms, if you have a blank disk in the drive and have unsaved
text in memory, then pressing USE FRONT-DISK will cause the Cat to
format the disk and save your document. However, the tForth
documentation also explains that all Forth words in RAM get written as
well, which is critical for our hackery. Ordinarily there wouldn’t be
any, of course, but it would if there were. Correspondingly, DISK will
also load a document and any associated words from a new disk as well,
though any disk access regardless of direction is still centered on the
editor — the Cat doesn’t run applications in the traditional sense.
(Spoiler alert: hang tight.)
<p>
But that’s not all it’s saving, though. If you read the DISK help
carefully, you’ll note it says something about showing “a sample of
what’s on the disk” if you have a different disk present. Ignoring the
question right now of how it determines which disk goes with what
workspace, how can it show the document on the floppy disk if the
entirety of RAM could be on it? Wouldn’t it overwrite the document in
memory?
<p>
Let’s dump this disk and investigate. It’s possible that the Canon drive
uses some weir-dass GCR format, but it turns out to our delight that
it’s regular MFM. Since we know it’s single-sided, there’s no need to
check both sides, and we can stop scanning at track 80. Thus, we can get
a read of the disk as a straight in-order sector dump with <tt>gw read
–format=ibm-scan –tracks=c=0-79:h=0 test.img</tt>.

An immediately interesting thing about this image dump is that each
track (cylinder)’s ten sectors are numbered 0-9, not 1-10 which is more
typical.
<p>
If we dump strings, we can find our text <tt>Enable Forth Language</tt>
near the end of the image. This makes sense since the text is stored in
the upper part of RAM, above the Forth dictionary. We can see some other
strings like <tt>-1 wheel! savesetup re</tt> presumably from when we
entered that command, though it appears earlier in the file.
<p>
We know that each track is 5120 bytes ($1400, 512 bytes times 10

This repeated sector is called the <i>idblock</i> and appears in the
technical documentation for the Cat’s editor. Because this is a 68K,
everything is big-endian as G-d Himself intended, though a fair bit of
it is unused. It contains copies of the 68000 data and address registers
in the first 64 bytes, the 68000 status register, a two-bit disk format
ID ($3326 here, but an earlier $3325 format is also accepted) required
to identify the disk as written by a Cat, a number of tracks ($0011 ==
17, though we found nineteen), various editor state variables, a
128-byte disk identifier called the <i>idtable</i> (that’s how it knows
which workspace is what, though only about 24 bytes of it are actually
populated here), and then pointers for any keyboard macros that were
defined.
<p>
The documentation notes that backup idblocks appear elsewhere on the
disk as well. One of these is in the first sector of the second track.
After that we see a lot of binary data with some scattered snippets of
text (later comparison shows this is the contents of the SV-RAM), and
then starting with the first sector of the third track this peculiarly
familiar-looking pattern:

<p>If you look at our screenshot for <tt>Enable Forth Language</tt>, you
see two 50% dithered grey blocks above and below it. Those are the
document separators. Anyone who’s messed around with the video memory in
a monochrome framebuffer will recognize the pattern of <tt>aa 55</tt> as
<tt>10101010 01010101</tt> — a 50% grey. Since we know our framebuffer
is linear and contiguous, let’s pull out the 28896 bytes (84 bytes per
line times 344 lines) from this offset and stick a Portable Bit Map
header on it. Guess what:</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJRklR_bMSEktVxzj97DZ-ETdDiJSisCi88O4kbaDHS9TFbeumpl5jwPeaez0VZbzpc0SjiuF1ST3PZCkFHm16DkfdGQFzsWA9ICMN6fCzAs6EECNrytXAaPWLXmayYRU4x06gReyFpaxiGyTAqNc2vW5LRxUmQd-6FD05SPm27eemMSZcGox4nn5ln2U/s672/testdisk.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" width="320" data-original-height="504" data-original-width="672" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJRklR_bMSEktVxzj97DZ-ETdDiJSisCi88O4kbaDHS9TFbeumpl5jwPeaez0VZbzpc0SjiuF1ST3PZCkFHm16DkfdGQFzsWA9ICMN6fCzAs6EECNrytXAaPWLXmayYRU4x06gReyFpaxiGyTAqNc2vW5LRxUmQd-6FD05SPm27eemMSZcGox4nn5ln2U/s320/testdisk.png"/></a>

That’s our text as a screenshot, just inverted, because PBM is black on
white. As the Cat also dumps video memory when it saves to disk, the
preview feature is nothing more than just loading it back. A clever
idea, too: it’s quick, it’s reversible with a repaint and it doesn’t
disturb anything else in memory. In fact, we can also see when fully
loading a document disk into the Cat that the preview image is loaded
into video memory as part of that process too (which gives the illusion
of it loading faster than it truly does). Moreover, the Cat doesn’t seem
to care what image data is there as long as it can read it.
<p>
So, as a test to make sure we can write our own arbitrary data to a Cat
floppy, let’s write something that can patch in a custom image. For the
picture data, I found a photo of Jef Raskin sitting at a desk in front
of a Cat, cropped and resized it to the right proportions, then crushed
and dithered it out to a ready PBM with <tt>magick raskin.png -resize
672x344! -dither FloydSteinberg -remap pattern:gray50 -negate
raskin.pbm</tt>.
<p>
Now we need a disk format we can master a new floppy from. This sector
dump, as easy as it was to parse, will not suffice for this purpose;
there’s not enough metadata about the sectors and tracks for the
Greaseweazle software to create the right geometry. We’d also like a
format that’s well-documented and higher-level than raw flux or raw MFM
because we know the Canon drive is writing renumbered but otherwise
normal sectors, and it will make the disk image easier to alter. And, of
course, the Greaseweazle software needs to support it. After reading
through the Greaseweazle wiki’s
<a href="https://github.com/keirf/greaseweazle/wiki/Supported-Image-Types">list
of supported formats</a>, I settled on the CPC
<a href="https://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/Format:DSK_disk_image_file_format">extended
DSK format</a> since it has a fully documented specification and was
likely to capture any unforeseen necessary nuances of the Cat’s format,
but still provides the actual sector data as decoded bytes. It can be
captured with a command line like <tt>gw read –format=ibm-scan
–tracks=c=0-79:h=0 test.edsk</tt>.
<p>
To verify viability, I captured the same floppy as eDSK and then wrote
it to another blank disk (<tt>gw write test.edsk</tt>), and checked if
the Cat would read that. It did!
<p>
However, moving to a higher fidelity format sometimes introduces
complications. One complication while reading test disks written by the
Cat was that some (not all) of them didn’t actually start on physical
track zero: they started on physical track two, leaving physical tracks
zero and one unformatted, even though the track as written
<em>claimed</em> to be track zero. I wasn’t sure of the significance of
this at the time — we’ll revisit this later. Interestingly, the eDSK
format also revealed that <em>every</em> sector on track zero is tagged
as sector one, all ten of them, probably to speed up checking if the
idtable on disk matches the current workspace or not since any sector
will do.
<p>
The second complication is that we no longer get sectors in logical
order but rather in the physical order they appear on disk, which may or
may not match. The Cat doesn’t seem to write tracks with any particular
interleave, so to read and write the eDSK sectors we’ll need to consult
the Track Information Block (TIB) for each track to determine which
sector is at which offset.
<p>
<p>In the Catbox are two Perl tools,
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/catrpic"><tt>catrpic</tt></a>
that will extract a PBM-format image from a Cat eDSK image (emitting the
picture to standard output), and
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/catwpic"><tt>catwpic</tt></a>
that will take a PBM-format image of the right dimensions and insert it
into a Cat eDSK (emitting the hybrid eDSK to standard output). You’ve
seen this picture before, but here it is again, the Cat loading from
this modified disk image:</p>

Unfortunately there’s not much else on this disk to load, so the picture
doesn’t stay on screen for very long. To rectify that we’ll have to
figure out how to make the Cat automatically run code from a disk.
Spoiler alert: <i>there’s a way to make the Cat automatically run code
from a disk.</i>
<p>
<h3>
Hack No. 1: The Jef Raskin Picture Disk
</h3>
<p>
In fact, some of you may have already realized how. Let’s look at the
idblock again, in which I mentioned the first 64 bytes are an image of
the 68K data and address registers, eight each. In the 68000
architecture register A7 is the stack pointer. Because we have control
of the stack pointer, we have control of the CPU’s return address: if we
change A7 in the idblock to another location, we can store a different
return address there, and on the next <tt>RTS</tt> we’ll take over the
CPU. This isn’t a flaw in the Cat’s operating system, by the way — think
of it more like <a href="https://github.com/4g3v/steelhax">save-file
hacking</a>, except that there’s no ASLR or execute protection, so once
you’re in, you’re in.
<p>
Reprising our disk’s idblock, A7 is marked in bold:
<p>
<div class="tx">

<p>
That location $407cfc is past the end of display memory at $4070e0 but
before the variable area declared to start at $40a280, so we can
hypothesize the processor stack normally lives somewhere in this range
(the tForth memory map calls this block part of the display memory, but
it doesn’t appear onscreen).
<p>
The Cat editor documentation provides two words that control saving and
loading from a disk: <tt>save</tt> and <tt>restore</tt>. In the Catbox I
wrote up <a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/fdis">a
tForth ROM disassembler in Perl called <tt>fdis</tt></a> that works with
the 1.74 ROMs (recovered tForth source code also exists for this, but
you can be confident you’re seeing exactly what’s being run by pulling
from the ROM). If you’ve got the MAME ROMs, unzip <tt>cat.zip</tt> and
convert the 1.74 ROMs from interleaved to continuous using
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/interleave_rom">the
Catbox’s <tt>interleave_rom</tt> tool</a>, like so:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./interleave_rom r74*.ic[24] &gt; rom
% ./interleave_rom r74*.ic[35] &gt;&gt; rom
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now we can use <tt>fdis</tt> to walk the ROM and print out the tForth
opcodes for a given token (if it’s a variable or 68K code, it will say
so instead). We’ll start with the <tt>restore</tt> routine, since we’re
trying to intercept loading. It appears deceptively short:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./fdis rom restore
token = 0x016b
0002cb88 1128 cstate
0002cb8a 65   off
0002cb8b 0305 &lt;restore&gt;

0002cb8f d3   emit
0002cb90 120c lastop
0002cb92 14e8 %disk
0002cb94 7c   =
0002cb95 26   &lt;;&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
<p>Yes, words can have angle brackets in them or indeed any symbol other
than whitespace. The meat appears to be in the word
<tt>&lt;restore&gt;</tt>, but the editor technical documentation says
it’s tricky:</p>
<blockquote>
The word <tt>&lt;restore&gt;</tt> reads useful information from the
idblock (already read from the disk by the Disk command … After this, it
reads the display memory, immediately displaying it on the screen. Then
it reads the remaining off-screen contents of the disk into memory.
<p>
It then executes the second half of <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> by use of a
non-standard programming method. The entire machine state, including
return stack, program counter and instruction pointer, is recorded. When
it is restored (copied back into memory), execution resumes where it
left off when <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> began writing the image into memory.
This creates an unusual situation.
<p>
The same code (in the second half of <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> is used by
both <tt>save</tt> and <tt>&lt;restore&gt;</tt>.
</blockquote>
The text isn’t quite accurate because the PC is not, in fact, part of
the idblock, but it does tell us most of the action is actually in
<tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt>. The reason both operations exit through common
code is because the save operation compacts the dictionary and working
text in memory before writing them out, so both the restore and save
operations must unpack them before returning to the editor — in the
restore case, after loading it from disk, and in the save case, after
writing it. This particular word has a somewhat lengthy definition and
we’re going to tear it apart later, but we can see right in the
beginning of <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> that the magic is done by a 68K
assembly routine:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./fdis rom "&lt;save&gt;"
token = 0x0304
0002c8d2 0433 notepointers
0002c8d4 0151 packforth

0002c8e6 21   wlit 0x812c
0002c8e9 dd   call
[...]
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This is calling a ROM routine at $812c. This routine, in part, starts by
capturing the CPU registers:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
 00812C  move    SR, $407664.l                               40F9 0040 7664

 00813A  movem.l D0-D7, $407620.l                            48F9 00FF 0040 7620
</pre>
</div>
<p>
which is used for the memory image of the outgoing idblock starting at
$407600. When the restore runs, another 68K ROM routine is called at the
end of <tt>&lt;restore&gt;</tt> after loading everything:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./fdis rom "&lt;restore&gt;"
token = 0x0305
0002ca6c d4   cls
0002ca6d 0106 recal
0002ca6f e5   ?diskerror
0002ca70 0109 idblock

0002cb83 38   &lt;abort"&gt;
0002cb84 26   &lt;;&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The ROM routine it calls at $8368 finishes by restoring those registers
from the in-memory idblock.

<p>
Assuming no error condition is detected, this routine has the effect of
restoring the stack pointer and all registers, including the state of
the tForth VM which is entirely stored in registers, to point to the
tForth word after the call to $812c in <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt>. I note for
completeness that this call actually occurs in two places, but both are
in the first part of the word, so the second part of
<tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> is executed regardless. (The <tt>LEA</tt> and
<tt>JMP</tt> idiom at $83ac is a fast way of doing a subroutine call by
not pushing to the stack and appears frequently in the Cat ROM.)
<p>
Now that we know where it comes out, and since we know restoring the
previous stack pointer will eventually return to the editor, we can
insert a diversion: during the loading process we’ll have the user press
a key to continue, so that they can appreciate our splendidly rendered
image, and then return to the editor via the rest of
<tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt>. Let’s make this a picture disk, complete with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin">Jef Raskin’s
Wikipedia entry</a>, so that you can read his biography using the Cat he
designed. It should show his picture, wait for the user’s admiration,
and then load the article which can be then scrolled and searched with
the LEAP keys.
<p>
<p>For the text, we’re going to take advantage of the serial port to
load the document for us. I used Lynx to download and render the
Wikipedia text to 80-column plain text, cleaned it up in a text editor,
and added some instructions.</p>

<p>The next step is to transmit it. Oddly enough, the serial connection
does <em>not</em> use a null modem: use a straight-thru DB-25 male on
the Cat end to DE-9 (“DB-9”) female on your workstation’s end, with your
favourite USB to RS-232 dongle if you need it. The serial port on the
Cat is between the printer port and the phone jacks.</p>

<p>By default the serial port is used as an alternate printer port, so
in the Setup screen we’ll switch it to the “SEND Command” (used for
serial communications) and “Full Duplex” with “CR/LF” for your line
terminator at 9600bps, 8-N-1. (The serial port is not supported in MAME
yet either.)</p>

You may have noticed the absence of flow control options in the Setup
screen, and that’s because the Cat only supports software flow control
with XON/XOFF. (This will be relevant in the third hack.) Sending the
text full blast will drop characters because the CPU has to wrap and
format it as text arrives.
<p>
<p>To avoid this problem, you could obviously use a terminal program
that supports XON/XOFF, or you could simply send data with a slight
delay after each character. I provide
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/sendfile.c">just
such a program (written in C)</a> in the Catbox; compile it with
something like <tt>gcc -O2 -o sendfile sendfile.c</tt>. To send the file
with a 10ms intercharacter delay, use a command line like <tt>sendfile
/dev/ttyUSB0 9600 raskin.txt 1,10</tt> which says to use
<tt>/dev/ttyUSB0</tt> at 9600 baud, sending <tt>raskin.txt</tt> with
10ms after every one character. Here the POWER9 Linux workstation is
pushing the document to the Cat which streams as characters are received
to the screen. Make sure text you transmit this way has CR-LF line
endings (e.g., <tt>set ff=dos</tt> in <tt>vim</tt>).</p>

With the document loaded, we’ll lock it against editing by pressing
DOCUMENT LOCK and save it to disk with USE FRONT-DISK. The disk is
blank, so it saves it immediately, after which we image it to an eDSK.
<p>
Now for the executable portion. Obviously we could write this code in
68K assembly, but we have a limited amount of space before potentially
running into the <em>real</em> stack and we’d like to keep the code as
small as possible. That means writing it in tForth, so we need a means
to jump back into tForth and have the VM run anonymous code that is not
actually stored as a “real” word.
<p>
As it happens, tForth supports this as part of the <tt>goto</tt> word,
which directly executes “naked” tForth code from memory given an
execution address. It does this using a special reserved word called
<tt>temp</tt>. <tt>temp</tt>’s definition ordinarily is simply to return
an error message:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
% ./fdis rom temp
token = 0x00f8
0000dc52 55   1
0000dc53 37   &lt;"&gt; "unassigned token "
0000dc66 38   &lt;abort"&gt;
0000dc67 26   &lt;;&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The <tt>&lt;abort”&gt;</tt> word takes a condition and a string, and if
the condition is true, displays the string as an error and aborts. As
the default definition pushes a literal 1 to the stack as the first
value, running this word under normal circumstances will immediately
raise an error and halt. But remember that the token table is in RAM and
therefore mutable. The <tt>goto</tt> word exploits this fact:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
./fdis rom goto
token = 0x00fe
0000dbbe 21   wlit 0x00f8
0000dbc1 92   +table
0000dbc2 5c   !
0000dbc3 f8   temp
0000dbc4 26   &lt;;&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The word <tt>+table</tt> is 68K code that takes the given token value
(it’s $f8 here, which we know is <tt>temp</tt>) and returns the location
of its execution address in the token table, basically multiplying it by
4 and adding the base address. This gets called a lot, so it needs to be
fast. In practice the address it yields appears to be constant and
predictable, so the execution address for <tt>temp</tt> will always be
located in the token table at $4107e0 on a 1.74 ROM system. It then
stores the new address — presto, the word is redefined — and calls it.
The tForth technical docs warn that the code must end with a
<tt>next</tt> token instead of the usual <tt>&lt;;&gt;</tt> for proper
continuation, which we can accommodate. To run the new chimaeric
<tt>temp</tt>, we’ll call the Forth word <tt>execute</tt>, which is a
68K ROM routine residing at $d5ea that takes the token value and token
table address of a word and runs it.
<p>
The 68K assembly equivalent of this is straightforward, which we’ll call
our <i>trampoline</i>. We’ll change A7 in every copy of the idblock in
the eDSK to point to a new 32-bit address which points to the word after
that, where our machine code payload will reside, followed by our tForth
tokens. Since we know where the display is on disk and we know the
framebuffer ends in the middle of a sector (28896 is not an even
multiple of 512), we have 288 extra bytes in that sector to insert the
code right there and still remain reasonably clear of the <em>real</em>
stack. This address could be $4070e0, immediately after the display
ends, but since things can get pushed temporarily it’s better to move it
down a bit so garbage doesn’t spill onto the bottom of the screen (I use
$407120 which gives a 64-byte red zone). The code looks like this, which
we compute at the time we patch the eDSK:
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
00407120 address pointing to entry 0040 7124
entry:
00407124 movea.l #OLD_A7,a7        2E7C OLD_ A7__
0040712a movea.l #$4107e0,a1       227C 0041 07E0
00407130 move.l #target,(a1)       22BC 0040 7142
00407136 move.l #$000000f8,d0      203C 0000 00F8
0040713c jmp $0000d5ea             4EF9 0000 D5EA
target:
00407142 jmp (a3)                  4ED3
; tforth tokens follow
</pre>
</div>
<p>
We restore the old A7 value, store the address of our payload
(<tt>target</tt>) to <tt>temp</tt>’s entry in the token table and
leaving the entry’s address in A1, load the token for <tt>temp</tt> to
D0 and jump into <tt>execute</tt>. I chose to use full 32-bit long
encodings for the parameters to make it easier to adjust for other ROM
versions with different addresses and token values. Notice that our
payload looks just like a regular tForth word, starting with the call
into the nesting routine. The D0 and A1 registers belong to a volatile
set used for arguments to ROM routines and are not part of the tForth
register state, so we can clobber them with impunity. We changed no
other relevant register other than A7 and we immediately set it back, so
we have not changed anything else other than to divert into our own
code. When our tForth block finishes, our cuckoo word will be unnested
and we’ll fall right back into <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> to complete the
restore process as if we never left it.
<p>
Finally, the tForth itself, which immediately follows the machine code
trampoline. The <tt>&lt;demit&gt;</tt> word will draw text to the
display at the given address; if the text has the high bit set, it will
render it in reverse video. Bold or normal text is determined by what
was used the last time a character was displayed, though for this
purpose either weight works. The code we want to execute is <tt>” press
any key” over + swap do i c@ i 407106 - 17 &lt;demit&gt; loop beep key
drop next ;</tt> which will put a string on the stack with its length,
loop over it and display each character, beep once, wait for a key,
throw it away and then exit as <tt>goto</tt> requires through
<tt>next</tt>. We could look the tokens up by hand, but we also can just
define it to a throwaway word and dump from its execution address using
<tt>c’</tt>.
<p>
<p>Our patcher will insert all of this into the 288 bytes at the end of
display memory on disk. Since most of you don’t have a Cat, here’s a
video of the picture disk in action.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

We turn on the Cat, insert the Raskin picture disk and press USE
FRONT-DISK. The disk loads, displaying our picture, and pauses with
“press any key” and a beep. (The disk light remains on as a side effect
since we haven’t yet run the word that turns the disk drive off.) We
press a key, loading completes, and the document appears. Next, we use
SHIFT and the LEAP keys to scroll line by line, then LEAP to the word
“Apple” forwards and back a few times (using USE FRONT-LEAP to leap
again with the same search), LEAP to the word “Aza,” and finally LEAP to
the DOCUMENT/PAGE marker, which will eventually bring us at the bottom
of the text. Sorry about the darkness and changing light levels, but
it’s hard to video a CRT with a Pixel 7 Pro.
<p>
The picture disk image is
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/tree/main/examples/raskin">in
the Catbox</a>. The patching program we’ll unveil at the end, since
we’re going to add more to it for the next couple hacks. Speaking of!
<p>
<h3>
Hack No. 2: CatTerm
</h3>
<p>
There are a couple downsides to what we just pulled for Hack No. 1, all
due to the fact we temporarily deviate from the restore process before
it completes. One minor drawback is that the floppy disk drive is still
active during code execution as the drive motor hasn’t been turned off
yet. But the big one is our limited execution area: the Forth dictionary
and document workspace are not unpacked until the end of loading, so the
technique we just used can only run within the small space provided and
can’t call longer words we create, only ones already in ROM.
<p>
That means we have to let the loading process finish to run larger
words, but if we do that naïvely then the Cat will still wind up in the
editor and never run our code. Altering the execution address for
<tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> in the token table won’t help us because it’s
already in motion, and we can’t change the code that’s executing …
unless we copy <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt> to RAM and run <em>that</em> as the
payload to our trampoline.
<p>
Here’s the rest of <tt>&lt;save&gt;</tt>, including the second call to
$812c. Either way we’ll end up in common code at $2c900 assuming no
errors.

<p>
The goal is to add code after the <tt>?diskerror</tt> word at $2c972
(which aborts on errors) and before the end of the definition at $2c973.
At that point the Cat’s state is fully restored and expanded from disk
but the editor has not yet been entered. Our tForth payload therefore
becomes a copy of everything from $2c900 to $2c972 inclusive, followed
by pushing our word’s token value with a <tt>wlit</tt> literal word and
<tt>execute re &lt;;&gt;</tt> with the explicit terminal call to
<tt>re</tt> cleaning up any residual leftovers. Mercifully, the branches
are relative and need not be relocated, and with the stack padding and
trampoline it still fits in the 288 bytes available, so we just spew out
the same tokens otherwise.
<p>
This idea has a lot of possibilities. For example, you could write up a
word to automatically execute from the disk to patch up editor words in
the token table for additional features, or install a utility, or even
take over the system entirely. (Spoiler alert: stay tuned.) So for this
second hack, we’re going to do something useful for a change: a simple
terminal program for the Cat. But wait, you say, doesn’t the Cat already
have the capability to send and receive serial data from the editor? It
does, but it’s not very asynchronous: you have to highlight and manually
send text (using SEND) and you can’t just type to the remote system, and
individual keystrokes are particularly inconvenient. Plus, maybe you
just don’t want your entire transcript in your document, especially if
you’re running low on space.
<p>
<p>As in the first hack, we’ll load the tForth source over the serial
port. Here it is:</p>

(Now here’s a great advancement in open source: it comes with its own
source code as the document, preparsed into the dictionary and set to
autostart. You can even preview the code with USE FRONT-DISK and see
what code you’re about to run. Wanna change it? Change the code in the
editor and USE FRONT-ANSWER, and the words will be redefined and ready
to execute. Save it to disk, repatch the disk image, and make it your
own.)
<p>
The main loop in <tt>cattermloop</tt> bounces between checking if a
character is waiting at the serial port and if a keypress is pending. If
one is at the port, it reads it and prints it to the terminal at the
cursor position. If one is at the keyboard, it grabs it, stuffs it into
the LEARN buffer if appropriate, and then checks to see if it’s the UNDO
key (code $e1). If it is, it exits the loop.
<p>
<p>The word we’ll execute, however, is <tt>catterm</tt>. I decided to be
a little silly here to prove a point. The Cat can operate in various
modes, with the variable <tt>edde</tt> set to true if it’s in the editor
and <tt>crt</tt> set to true if it’s at the prompt. But these are just
memory locations, so you can either do <tt>edde on</tt> or <tt>-1 40f884
!</tt>, which references its address explicitly (yes, values are
signed). By forcing these modes, you can make text go different places.
We don’t want anything emitted to the document, so if we started
execution from the editor we turn the <tt>edde</tt> variable off and the
<tt>crt</tt> variable on, start the loop, and then set them back and
repaint the screen (otherwise we “just do it”). Properly written,
however, you can also just say <tt>edde on</tt> and <tt>crt off</tt>,
and vice versa.</p>

We highlight the entire text and do USE FRONT-ANSWER to define the
words, and then take a test drive with <tt>catterm</tt> from the
<tt>ok</tt> prompt. It works! Now we’ll grab the token value for
<tt>catterm</tt> and use that as a parameter to the patch utility. The
exact value will vary depending on what words were defined already, but
in this case, it’s $07e2.
<p>
<p>As a last convenience we enter and highlight the word
<tt>catterm</tt> in the document so that you can just run it again from
the editor by pressing USE FRONT-ANSWER. We save it to disk and create a
disk image, and patch it. Here it is booting. I couldn’t run to the
workstation and type at the same time as I was filming, but you can see
that it autostarts and cleanly returns to the editor. The CatTerm disk
image is

the Catbox</a>.</p>

I also demonstrate running it from the <tt>ok</tt> prompt by pressing
SHIFT-USE FRONT-SPACE, entering <tt>page</tt>, entering
<tt>catterm</tt>, and after pressing UNDO entering <tt>re</tt> to return
to the editor. Everything works just as it should. Port speed and
settings are configured with SETUP, just like everywhere else.
<p>
But what if you don’t <em>want</em> to return to the editor?

<h3>
Hack No. 3: The First Canon Cat Demo?
</h3>
<p>
This might be where I become branded a heretic by the School of Raskin
for escaping the primary interface. But it’s a general purpose computer,
and we should be able to use it for general purpose computer things.
Plenty of stuff took over the Mac entirely, so I don’t see why the Cat
should be any different.
<p>
For this last hack, we’ll go all the way live and make a full-fledged
slideshow demo. I’ll select and convert some pictures as a love letter
to the 1980s office and we’ll have the Cat load them in sequence
directly from disk. When you exit the demo, it will cold-start the
machine back to the editor (so we’ll dub this a “cold booter”).
<p>
Our payload can now be shorter, because the words for setting up the
editor no longer need to be run. However, we still need to unpack the
document text, such as it is (we can overwrite it later if we want),
because it must be shifted up in RAM first to ensure the Forth
dictionary ends up in the right place. In addition, we need to set a
system flag to prevent screen repaints during that process or any title
screen we put on the disk will get obliterated.
<p>
After the <tt>doff</tt> at $2c91d, which turns off the disk drive, in
our cold booter payload I insert a <tt>showmove? off</tt> to ensure
<tt>unpacktext</tt> doesn’t try to repaint the screen. We’ll then do
everything up to, but stop short of, the <tt>setupcat</tt> at $2c947.
Instead, at that point we’ll push our token and end with <tt>execute
cold ;</tt> since we won’t be returning to the editor and we won’t try
to keep any of the system variables intact.
<p>
Now for the pictures. It will be simplest to segregate the slides to a
second disk which we can occupy the whole of. We’ll have the Cat format
it, then promptly overwrite it with our own data. The <tt>rtrk</tt> and
<tt>wtrk</tt> words will load or save an entire track of data (5120
bytes) to or from a given memory address, so we will have each picture
occupy 28896 bytes divided by 5120 bytes per track to equal 5.64375
tracks, i.e., six tracks apiece rounded up. This is a little inefficient
for the last portion of the display but we’re optimizing for speed here.
<p>
<p>If we’re going to ask for a new disk, we should do so with style, so
this will be our screenshot image. C’mon, he’s the original father of
the Mac too!</p>

<p>We will blink the question mark until the disk is switched, as a
classic Mac would do, then draw the original
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_startup#Happy_Mac">Happy
Mac</a> over it and proceed with the slides. Here they are, largely
extracted from contemporary marketing material, then edited in Krita and
Floyd-Steinberg dithered with ImageMagick. Any blurriness in these grabs
is due to the upscaling I did to match the CRT aspect ratio; they are
sharp on the Cat.</p>

I then used <tt>catrpic</tt> from the first hack to extract it and added
it to the pile as the final image.
<p>
To create the slides, after having the Cat format a blank disk, we’ll
transmit the bitmap data via the serial port. This is binary safe
<em>if</em> we disable XON/XOFF first, or otherwise the Cat will
intercept and act on those characters. For example, this snippet at the
<tt>ok</tt> prompt will wait for data from the serial port and read
28896 bytes from it, spewing them to the screen directly. We assume your
serial port is still configured for “SEND Command/Full Duplex” at
9600bps, 8-N-1.
<p>
<div class="tx">
<pre>
ser.xon.tx.off page 4070e0 400000 do ser.rx i c! loop key drop
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then send the 28896-byte raw bitmap data (in our case, the scaled and
dithered PBM with the PBM header removed) with something like
<tt>sendfile /dev/ttyUSB0 9600 image.cat</tt> — no intercharacter delay
is necessary as this loop will have no problem keeping up. Note that we
use <tt>ser.xon.tx.off</tt> to disable acting on <em>received</em>
XON/XOFF characters, but actually fetch characters with <tt>ser.rx</tt>
(which will wait for a byte to be ready). Once all bytes are loaded, it
will wait for a key, and then stop.
<p>
<p>We’ll test it <s>on Captain Solo</s> by writing out a track and
trying to read it back.</p>

We turn off XON/XOFF for receive, load the image, then write out six

Happy Mac from an internal set of bitmap values instead of trying to

<p>
This is all pushed over the serial link and parsed into words on the Cat
using the same process as before.
<p>
The main code starts with <tt>slideshow</tt> where we first make sure
all updates go direct to the screen. After that, the <tt>diskwait</tt>
word is what waits for the state changes of the floppy. It has its own
routines for erasing and redrawing the blinking question mark. This word
takes the token of another word as an argument which it calls to
determine whether the desired condition is satisfied, so we call it
first with <tt>diskwaitout</tt> to wait for the first disk to be
removed, then <tt>diskwaitin</tt> to wait for the second disk to be
inserted. These words directly manipulate the floppy drive through Gate
Array #3 by briefly turning it on to check for the disk, then waiting
for a settling period after the motor starts to get the disk status
back. The question mark is encoded as a series of literal words pushed
onto the stack in reverse order so they get pulled off in the right
order for the loop.
<p>
With the next disk in, the <tt>recal</tt> word seeks for track zero and
returns 0 for success or an error code for failure. Assuming it can find
it, it draws the Happy Mac (with whole 32-bit words this time but using
the same principle), primes the keyboard, and starts with the first
picture, the Shocked Mac. The <tt>trackpic</tt> word loads the six-track
image and waits for a keypress in a given timeframe, cold-starting the
Cat if the UNDO key is pressed. The cold start process will of course
try to read the disk, but it won’t be recognized as a Cat floppy and
will be ignored, thus putting the user back into the editor.
<p>
This does give the floppy drive quite a workout. You’ll notice that the
Shocked Mac appears only the very first time it boots and never in the
loop after that, and it’s because I think my floppy drive has a marginal
track zero switch (at the age these drives are, I suspect other
otherwise-working Cat drives have a similar problem). This switch
appears to be mechanical on the Canon drive rather than the more typical
LED/sensor combination. More times than not this particular disk drive
could get back to track zero, but sometimes it wouldn’t, which explains
why some of my reads from disks the Cat wrote started on physical track
two even though the Cat’s firmware obviously believed it was writing
track zero. It doesn’t seem like an alignment problem with the switch or
the drive because when it <em>does</em> find track zero, it reads disks
written by the Teac (our “perfectly aligned” brand spanking new floppy
drive) just fine, and obviously it’s also able to write track zero more
often than not or this demo might not have been possible.
<p>
Accordingly, the problem I ran into with this hack was the drive
couldn’t reliably get back to track zero after the last picture either
(it’s over 60 tracks away by then). If this happens to you in the
editor, you can just try reading the disk again until it “gets it.” But
here <tt>rtrk</tt> will pause waiting patiently for the correct track to
come by, which probably won’t happen for the good minute or so it waits
until it times out. Trying to manually step the head back in track by
track didn’t really help. The best solution was just to start back over
on track 6 instead of track 0, and that seemed to work generally okay,
though this is probably not a demo you want to leave running repeatedly
on the Cat regardless.
<p>

This hack brings you the final iteration of
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/catcpic"><tt>catcpic</tt></a>,
which now is a three-headed application. It requires your original eDSK
and a properly formatted and inverted PBM, generates a nice randomized
idtable so that your Cat can’t confuse it with anything else (though you
can pass it one in hex with <tt>-idtable=…</tt> if you want) and emits
the resulting disk image to standard output. If you don’t pass it a
token in hex, it will install the “press any key” patch; if you do, and
you specify <tt>-cold</tt>, you’ll get a cold booter; otherwise you’ll
get a autostarter that will enable you to cleanly return to the editor.
<p>
To compensate for the situation where your Cat’s drive might also be
acting up and not truly writing to track zero either, I’ve also included
<a href="https://github.com/classilla/catbox/blob/main/optedsk">an eDSK
optimizer tool</a>. It will remove and properly relocate unformatted
tracks, or even formatted tracks before the detected idtrack if you use
<tt>-force</tt>, adjusting the eDSK DIB and TIBs and emitting the
corrected disk image to standard output. You can also just say
<tt>-test</tt> to see what it thinks about a particular image (<tt>-test
-force</tt> will make it continue even if it doesn’t think the disk is a
Cat disk).

<h3>
Things to do
</h3>
<p>
Some considerations for <a href="/search/label/canon">a future
entry</a>:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Figure out how to lash something like a Gotek floppy emulator to the Cat
because I’m not sure how much more life this disk drive’s got in it. The
idea should be along the lines of building one of the adapters that let
you use a PC floppy drive, but then plug an emulator into it instead.
<li>
Fix for v2.4x ROMs, which some Cat enthusiasts run now, but that would
require me to modify my Cat to do so, which I’m not entirely willing to
do without a good reason. I’ll take patches, though.
<li>
A proper set of games for the Cat. How about a text adventure played in
the editor?
<li>
Audio demo? The <tt>tone</tt> and related words for playing audio tones
documented in the tForth manual are not in the 1.74 ROM. There is a
<tt>beep</tt> word which twiddles with the DUART, but it’s not clear if
it only beeps or can be made to play other tones.
<li>
uCLinux? If a Palm Pilot can run it …
<li>
Write shorter blog posts? (Nah.)

It’s nice to see that at least the utopian bubble of Santa Barbara has
moved beyond the rest of the country in forgiving our forefathers for
their actions and how society and civilization operated in eras gone by.
