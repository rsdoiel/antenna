But their broadcast tower is located about 10 miles northeast, in
Pontoon Beach, IL. My Dad was the director of engineering overseeing the
tower and studios for about 20 years, and though he’s no longer there,
he and I got permission from Audacy and the St. Louis engineers
(thanks!) to tour the site, and learn a bit about how they broadcast
their AM signal—which reaches all the way into Canada and Mexico at
night!

Citation
</h3>
2023 marks a significant date for the LOCKSS Program: It is the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the friendly hikes in Joseph Grant State
Park and Big Basin where Victoria Reich and Dr. David S.R. Rosenthal
first conceived of LOCKSS, “lots of copies keeps stuff safe,” as a
guiding principle for long-term access and preservation to digital
library resources. It is also the twentieth anniversary of the
transition of the LOCKSS project from beta testing in 2002 to full
production release. In the words of the duo’s nominator, “Even if you
don’t know David Rosenthal and Vicky Reich by name, you’ve almost
certainly heard their rallying cry for digital preservation: Lots Of
Copies Keep Stuff Safe. This ethos has informed digital preservation
best practices since its introduction, and has shaped the design and
implementation of the LOCKSS open-source software.”<br /> <br /> David
Rosenthal and Vicky Reich’s brainchild—and the enduring preservation
networks that it has made possible—was at the leading edge of a global
wave of digital preservation initiatives in the early 20th century. The
effectiveness and reliability of LOCKSS software has been validated
through rigorous third-party evaluation, including ongoing certification
of the CLOCKSS archive as a trustworthy digital repository under the
TRAC standard since 2014. The LOCKSS project has provided enduring proof
of the concept that large-scale digital preservation work can be
accomplished cost-effectively and with community benefits (not vendor
profits) as the primary driver.<br /> <br /> Rosenthal and Reich’s work
on LOCKSS stands as a benchmark against which other approaches to
digital preservation and persistent access to digital resources are
measured. <br />
<h3>
Response
</h3>
The LOCKSS Program was
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/lockss-program-turns-25.html">25
years old</a> last month. Vicky and David would like to thank:<br />
<ul>
<li>
The international user community and Stanford staff who are using,
evolving and improving the software.
</li>
<li>
Our far sighted funders who got the program up and running —
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lesk">Michael Lesk</a> at
the NSF and then
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2019/08/a-tribute-to-don-waters.html">Don
Waters</a> at the Mellon Foundation.
</li>
<li>
And three brilliant Stanford Computer Science PhD students who provided
the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/945445.945451">award winning
science</a> behind the technology — Mema Roussopoulos, Petros Maniatis
and TJ Giuli.
</li>
</ul>
We learned many lessons over the two decades we worked on the program,
none of them a surprise to anyone in the preservation business. Two that
are key. For a program to survive the long term it is critical to:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Build and nurture relationships, among the staff, among the user
community, and with the funders.
</li>
<li>
Document, document, document. Write it down, whatever it is. Over a
quarter-century it is easy to forget things such as “why was it done
this way?”.
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are honored by and grateful for this award, and happy that the
program we left for our new career as full-time grandparents is
flourishing in good hands.<br /> <br /></p>

id="more-pandas-will-be-coming-to-the-us-chinas-president-signals">More
Pandas Will Be Coming to the US, China’s President Signals</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping signaled that China will send new pandas
to the United States, calling them “envoys of friendship between the
Chinese and American peoples.”</p>
<p>“We are ready to continue our cooperation with the United States on
panda conservation, and do our best to meet the wishes of the
Californians so as to deepen the friendly ties between our two peoples,”
Xi said Wednesday during a dinner speech with business leaders.</p>
<p>The gesture came at the end of a day in which Xi and President Joe
Biden held their first face to face meeting in a year and pledged to try
to reduce tensions. Xi did not share additional details on when or where
pandas might be provided but appeared to suggest the next pair of pandas
are most likely to come to California, probably San Diego.</p>
<p>The bears have long been the symbol of the U.S.-China friendship
since Beijing gifted a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington
in 1972, ahead of the normalization of bilateral relations. Later,
Beijing loaned the pandas to other U.S. zoos, with proceeds going back
to panda conservation programs.</p>
<p>The National Zoo’s three giant pandas, Mei Xiang, Tian Tian and their
cub Xiao Qi Ji, eight days ago began their long trip to China. After
their departure, only four pandas are left in the United States, in the
Atlanta Zoo.</p>
<p>“I was told that many American people, especially children, were
really reluctant to say goodbye to the pandas, and went to the zoo to
see them off,” Xi said in his speech. He added that he learned the San
Diego Zoo and people in California “very much look forward to welcoming
pandas back.”</p>
<p>Xi is in California to attend a summit of Indo-Pacific leaders and
for his meeting with Biden. He made no mention of the pandas during his
public remarks earlier in the day as he met with Biden.</p>
<p>When bilateral relations began to sour in the past few years, members
of the Chinese public started to demand the return of giant pandas.
Unproven allegations that U.S. zoos mistreated the pandas, known as
China’s “national treasure,” flooded China’s social media.</p>
<p>But relations showed signs of stabilization as Xi traveled to San
Francisco to meet with Biden. The two men met for about four hours
Wednesday at the picturesque Filoli Historic House &amp; Garden, where
they agreed to cooperate on anti-narcotics, resume high-level military
communications and expand people-to-people exchanges.</p>
<p>The National Zoo’s exchange agreement with the China Wildlife
Conservation Association had been set to expire in early December and
negotiations to renew or extend the deal did not produce results.</p>
<p>The San Diego Zoo returned its pandas in 2019, and the last bear at
the Memphis, Tennessee, zoo went home earlier this year.</p>

China Prioritizes De-escalation With US Through Xi-Biden Meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Following the meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese
leader Xi Jinping in San Francisco on Wednesday, analysts say Beijing is
hoping to de-escalate tension with the U.S. by easing its stance and
projecting a less confrontational tone.</p>
<p>“In the official readout, Xi states China has no plan to surpass or
supplant America and he also notes that China doesn’t export its
ideology, showing a markedly narrower scope of geopolitical ambition,”
Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University
(ANU), told VOA in a written response.  </p>
<p>He said the messages are in stark contrast to Xi’s previous
proclamation that “the East is rising and the West is falling.”</p>
<p>In the official readout released on Thursday, Xi highlighted the
importance for Beijing and Washington to avoid confrontation, saying
that “turning their back on each other” is not an option for the two
superpowers.</p>
<p>“Major-country competition can’t solve the problems facing China and
the United States or the world,” he said. “The world is big enough to
accommodate both countries and one country’s success is an opportunity
for the other.”</p>
<p>Apart from emphasizing the need to avoid conflict, Xi said China has
no plan to “surpass or unseat the United States” and that it doesn’t
export its ideology.</p>
<p>He laid out five principles for Beijing and Washington to manage
bilateral relations, calling on both sides to develop a “right
perception,” jointly manage disagreements, advance mutually beneficial
cooperation, shoulder responsibilities as major countries, and promote
people-to-people ties.</p>
<p>“It is important that they appreciate each other’s principles and red
lines and have more communications, more dialogues, more consultations
and calmly handle their differences as well as accidents,” Xi said.</p>
<p>Some experts say the points highlighted in the readout and other
efforts from Beijing before the meeting all suggest the Chinese
government’s desire to frame the meeting between Biden and Xi as a
success. “I think the overall response [from Beijing] was firm but
positive,” Amanda Hsiao, senior China analyst at International Crisis
Group, told VOA by phone.</p>
<p>In her view, the Chinese government wants to project the image that
it remains in control of the bilateral relationship but it’s also
opening up to the U.S. “[Beijing wants to show] that it is extending a
gesture out to the U.S. to improve relations but it’s doing so from a
position of strength,” she said.</p>
<p>While some analysts view Beijing’s messages from the readout as
largely conciliatory and positive, others say it still reflects China’s
reservation about Washington’s possible attempt to influence its
governance system.</p>
<p>“The mention of not changing each other’s systems suggests China’s
suspicion that the United States is out to alter its communist
party-dominated system,” Ian Chong, a political scientist at National
Singapore University, told VOA in a written response.</p>
<p>Xi emphasizes ‘common interests’</p>
<p>Apart from emphasizing the importance of preventing competition from
escalating into conflict, Xi also highlighted the need for China and the
U.S. to expand cooperation in a wide range of areas, including economy,
trade, agriculture, climate change, and artificial intelligence.  </p>
<p>“The common interests between China and the United States have
increased, not decreased,” he said, according to the readout.</p>
<p>Despite his emphasis on broadening the scope of bilateral
cooperation, Xi also urged the U.S. to end export controls and the
practice of investment screening, referring to a government executive
order that restricts U.S. investments into Chinese companies or
Chinese-owned companies engaged in three advanced technology areas. 
 </p>
<p>“Stifling China’s technological progress is nothing but a move to
contain China’s high-quality development and deprive the Chinese people
of their right to development,” Xi said, adding that China’s development
and growth “won’t be stopped by external forces.”</p>
<p>Sung from ANU said these messages show that Washington’s controls
risking may be generating enough pressure on China to force Beijing to
“pivot back to a more conciliatory posture.”  </p>
<p>“China’s economic woes seem to be catching up with its foreign policy
rhetoric,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>As part of the effort to encourage foreign investment in China, Xi
told a group of U.S. business leaders that China would be a “friend and
partner” of the U.S. while reiterating that Beijing “never bet on the
United States to lose.”  </p>
<p>“The world needs China and the U.S. to work together for a better
future,” he told an audience of business leaders, including Apple CEO
Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. “China is ready to be a partner and
friend of the U.S.”</p>
<p>Given the economic slowdown that China has experienced since the
start of 2023, Chong in Singapore said Xi would like to encourage
foreign investment and technological exchanges, as it “could help foster
growth” in the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Attempt to reduce tension over Taiwan</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing tension between China and the U.S. over Taiwan,
Xi still briefly addressed the topic during his meeting with Biden.
According to the readout, he urged the U.S. to “take real actions” to
honor its commitment of “not supporting Taiwan independence, stop arming
Taiwan and support China’s reunification.”  </p>
<p>“China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable,” he
said.</p>
<p>Compared to previous statements on Taiwan, Hsiao from the
International Crisis Group said Xi’s remarks on Wednesday were
relatively brief. “In the past, you would see a long elaboration of
China’s position on Taiwan, but this tone is different,” she told
VOA.</p>
<p>In her view, the latest statement from Beijing is more specific about
what China is asking of the U.S. when it comes to Taiwan. “I think what
we have seen from this readout, as well as from the U.S. side, indicate
that the two sides are seeking to de-escalate around Taiwan,
particularly because there are elections coming up, which could create
unknowns in the relationship and could potentially see tensions flare
up,” Hsiao said.</p>
<p>While the messages from China seem more positive and conciliatory,
Hsiao said the essence of U.S.-China relations hasn’t changed.  </p>
<p>“It remains a competitive relationship and even if China continues to
say that it believes it’s not a competitive relationship, it will
continue to see Washington as a key rival in reality,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>She thinks the biggest achievement of the Biden-Xi meeting is to
create some protection against some key events that will take place in
the next year, including presidential elections in Taiwan and the U.S.
 </p>
<p>“It’s important that this meeting occurred so we have that buffer
going into the year where things might get commensurate,” Hsiao
said.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Veterans often develop a unique slate of skills when serving in the
armed forces, but private-sector employers sometimes fail to recognize
those abilities. At a time when many companies are still struggling to
hire up, how can we more successfully match veterans’ talents with
civilian opportunities? Also: tackling discrimination in internet access
and recapping the Biden-Xi talks.

From the BBC World Service: Russia is the world’s largest producer of
rough diamonds, and despite all the sanctions imposed after the invasion
of Ukraine last year, diamonds are one of the few major exports still
untouched. But that’s about to change. Plus, Taiwan is at the heart of
the world’s semiconductor trade, but as tensions with China persist, is
it viable to have so much production in one place?

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Target recently announced that it was closing nine store locations because of &amp;#8220;organized retail crime.&amp;#8221; The term, which is often used interchangeably with &amp;#8220;organized retail theft,&amp;#8221; is being used more and more to describe viral videos of what&amp;#8217;s often seen as &amp;#8220;brazen&amp;#8221; theft taking place in retail stores like Walgreens, CVS and Target.

<h2 id="personal-software">Personal software</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Personal software
</h1>
<p>
A few days ago, I was wondering about people writing the software for
their personal site – a blog or a wiki or a digital garden or a
Zettelkasten – running software the authors wrote themselves or got from
a friend. As it turns out, a few people sent me their links and so I’ve
started a collection called
<a href="https://transjovian.org/view/web-sites/index">The text and the
code go hand in hand</a>.
</p>
<p>
The following is a copy of the intro to the collection.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I hear of “opinionated” software. That is, software which has
a strong vision of how to do a thing. If you like it, use it. If you
don’t, then don’t. But what happens if the software turns out to be
something the author of a site wrote for themselves? It’s more than
opinionated. It’s personal.
</p>
<p>
This website presents a number of sites and the tools they use to create
and update them.
</p>
<p>
If you’re wondering why the list is small, the explanation is that
personal tools are not tidied up and yet we live in a world of software
that is written for being shared. In the corporate context, team
members, reviewers and successors need to understand the code. In the
private world, public code is polished in order to reflect well on
programmers and their abilities.
</p>
<p>
But <em>night software</em> is not like that. It’s not written for the
day job. It’s not written to see the light of day at all. It’s not
written to be looked at and scrutinized by anybody. It’s intimate and
personal, it’s messy and buggy. To take a look is to transgress.
</p>
<p>
And yet, this software offers the unique chance of being the kernel of
convivial software: a tool that we can not only learn how to use but
that we can disassemble and reassemble. We can imagine little computer
clubs discussing our tools, showing how we added this feature or that
feature. It is possible because the tools are small.
</p>
<p>
So if you’re thinking “that stuff is all a huge tangled mess” and “the
code generating my website is not for the public…” – then rest assured.
This is exactly what I’m trying to show. I remember my first system
being a collection of GNU M4 macros and a Makefile and I’d publish it in
a heartbeat, if I still had it. That’s how I wrote my GeoCities pages.
</p>
<p>
I’d love to show the world the unpolished, “just good enough with a
number of bugs I know of” solutions. Let me know if you have one.

id="us-warrantless-surveillance-law-up-for-renewal-amid-calls-for-reform">US
Warrantless Surveillance Law Up for Renewal Amid Calls for Reform</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A controversial section of federal law that gives U.S. intelligence
agencies the ability to conduct warrantless surveillance of the
communications of non-U.S. persons abroad will expire at the end of the
year, creating pressure on Congress to renew it, even as privacy
activists demand that it be reformed.  </p>
<p>Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
allows electronic surveillance of non-U.S. persons overseas and outside
the United States for purposes of national security. It also contains a
provision allowing for surveillance of foreign intelligence targets
within the U.S., subject to the approval of a special Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance court.    </p>
<p>Because the surveillance of foreign nationals can often pick up the
communications of American citizens who are not its direct target, many
civil liberties organizations believe FISA operations violate legal
protections on individual privacy. Adding to that concern is the fact
that the information collected as part of FISA surveillance can be
queried by domestic law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, without a warrant. Critics say this practice amounts
to “backdoor searches.”  </p>
<p>Investigations in recent years have found numerous instances in which
law enforcement agencies have abused the FISA process to obtain access
to information about U.S. nationals. That includes operations that
gathered information about former President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign
team and others that targeted the leaders of the Black Lives Matter
movement.  </p>
<p>Rights groups object  </p>
<p>Jeramie D. Scott, senior counsel and director of the Electronic
Privacy Information Center’s (EPIC) Project on Surveillance Oversight,
told VOA that his group believes the law should only be renewed if major
safeguards are added.  </p>
<p>“EPIC and our coalition partners have been very clear that Section
702 should not be reauthorized without significant reforms, including a
warrant requirement for searches of U.S. persons’ information,” he wrote
in an email exchange.  </p>
<p>Kia Hamadanchy, a senior policy counsel with the American Civil
Liberties Union, said that his organization has been challenging Section
702 since the day FISA was signed into law, and that its opposition
continues.    </p>
<p>“We have serious, serious concerns with how the problem is being
operated,” he told VOA. “Over the last 15 years, we’ve seen a whole host
of abuses. … So, our current position is that Section 702 should not be
reauthorized absent fundamental reform.”    </p>
<p>Law enforcement cites need  </p>
<p>In an appearance before the House Committee on Homeland Security on
Wednesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray delivered prepared testimony in
which he outlined a broad range of security threats facing the country,
and said that allowing Section 702 to expire, or restricting its use,
would make the country less safe.  </p>
<p>“Loss of this vital provision, or its reauthorization in a narrowed
form, would raise profound risks,” Wray said. “For the FBI in
particular, either outcome could mean substantially impairing, or in
some cases entirely eliminating, our ability to find and disrupt many of
the most serious security threats.”  </p>
<p>At the same hearing, Christine Abizaid, director of the National
Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), described Section 702 as essential to
protecting the country against terrorist attacks.  </p>
<p>“One of the most important questions for NCTC to determine is whether
international terrorists could gain access to and pose a threat to the
Homeland,” Abizaid said in her prepared testimony. “Section 702 is
essential for our ability to do that, and without it, the United States
and the world will be less safe.”  </p>
<p>Different tracks in Congress  </p>
<p>There appear to be at least two competing Section 702 reauthorization
proposals making their way through Congress.  </p>
<p>Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers from both the House of
Representatives and the Senate announced the introduction of the
Government Surveillance Reform Act, which would reauthorize Section 702
with significant restrictions.  </p>
<p>Among other things, the bill would require domestic law enforcement
agencies to obtain a warrant before searching FISA data for information
about American citizens. It has been endorsed by a large number of civil
liberties organizations. </p>
<p>“Americans know that it is possible to confront our country’s
adversaries ferociously without throwing our constitutional rights in
the trash can,” said Senator Ron Wyden, one of the co-sponsors, when the
bill was introduced. “But for too long, surveillance laws have not kept
up with changing times.” </p>
<p>Narrower reform    </p>
<p>On Tuesday, the news organization Politico obtained a set of talking
points outlining the shape of a competing Section 702 reauthorization
proposal being considered by the House Permanent Select Committee on
Intelligence. The restrictions it would place on law enforcement use of
Section 702 are fewer. For example, domestic law enforcement agencies
would only need to obtain a warrant to search FISA data for “evidence of
a crime.”  </p>
<p>Rights groups criticized the intelligence committee’s version of
reform for not going far enough.  </p>
<p>“Limiting a warrant requirement to ‘evidence of a crime’ searches
does little to address the well-documented abuses of the 702 authority,”
said Scott of EPIC. “Furthermore, any serious proposal for reform needs
to go beyond 702 to close similar loopholes that allow the government to
obtain Americans’ information without a warrant. To not do so is to not
take Americans’ privacy and civil liberties seriously.”</p>

id="progress-in-childhood-cancer-has-stalled-for-blacks-and-hispanics-us-report-says">Progress
in Childhood Cancer has Stalled for Blacks and Hispanics, US Report
Says</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Advances in childhood cancer are a success story in modern medicine.
But in the past decade, those strides have stalled for Black and
Hispanic youth, opening a gap in death rates, according to a new report
published Thursday.</p>
<p>Childhood cancers are rare and treatments have improved drastically
in recent decades, saving lives.</p>
<p>Death rates were about the same for Black, Hispanic and white
children in 2001, and all went lower during the next decade. But over
the next 10 years, only the rate for white children dipped a little
lower.</p>
<p>“You can have the most sophisticated scientific advances, but if we
can’t deliver them into every community in the same way, then we have
not met our goal as a nation,” said Dr. Sharon Castellino, a pediatric
cancer specialist at Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute in
Atlanta, who had no role in the new report.</p>
<p>She said the complexity of new cancers treatments such as gene
therapy, which can cure some children with leukemia, can burden families
and be an impediment to getting care.</p>
<p>“You need at least one parent to quit their job and be there 24/7,
and then figure out the situation for the rest of their children,”
Castellino said. “It’s not that families don’t want to do that. It’s
difficult.”</p>
<p>More social workers are needed to help families file paperwork to get
job-protected leave and make sure the child’s health insurance is
current and doesn’t lapse.</p>
<p>The overall cancer death rate for children and teenagers in the U.S.
declined 24% over the two decades, from 2.75 to 2.10 per 100,000,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report.</p>
<p>The 2021 rate per 10,000 was 2.38 for Black youth, 2.36 for Hispanics
and 1.99 for whites.</p>
<p>Nearly incurable 50 years ago, childhood cancer now is survivable for
most patients, especially those with leukemia. The leading cause of
cancer deaths in kids is now brain cancer, replacing leukemia.</p>
<p>Each year in the U.S. about 15,000 children and teens are diagnosed
with cancer. More than 85% live for at least five years.</p>
<p>The improved survival stems from research collaboration among more
than 200 hospitals, said Dr. Paula Aristizabal of the University of
California, San Diego. At Rady Children’s Hospital, she is trying to
include more Hispanic children, who are underrepresented in
research.</p>
<p>“Equity means that we provide support that is tailored to each
family,” Aristizabal said.</p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute is working to gather data from every
childhood cancer patient with the goal of linking each child to
state-of-the-art care. The effort could improve equity, said Dr. Emily
Tonorezos, who leads the institute’s work on cancer survivorship.</p>
<p>The CDC’s report is “upsetting and discouraging,” she said. “It gives
us a roadmap for where we need to go next.”</p>

id="biden-cites-moves-on-fentanyl-ai-and-military-communications-after-xi-meeting">Biden
Cites Moves on Fentanyl, AI and Military Communications After Xi
Meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said he made “positive steps” during an
intense hourslong meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The two agreed to re-establish lapsed military communications, work
together to assess the threats posed by artificial intelligence, and
work to combat the scourge of fentanyl.</p>
<p>However, Biden’s off-the-cuff comment that he still sees the powerful
Chinese leader as a “dictator,” revealed that the two leaders remain, in
some ways, far apart.</p>
<p>“Well, look, he is,” Biden said, in response to a shouted question
from the clamoring throng of journalists at the secluded meeting site
outside of San Francisco, where 21 Asia-Pacific economies are holding a
summit this week.</p>
<p>“He is a dictator in a sense that he is a guy that runs a country, a
communist country, that’s based on a totally different form of
government than ours.”</p>
<p>The White House chose a sprawling, bucolic estate more than an hour’s
drive from San Francisco for this heavily symbolic visit covering a
range of key issues that included Taiwan – the self-governing island
that China claims – the possible resumption of military communications,
touchy trade disagreements, the origination of fentanyl ingredients in
China, and human rights issues.</p>
<p>The scenic grounds cover the San Andreas fault, where the Pacific and
North American tectonic plates touch.</p>
<p>Biden said he was “candid” on these tough issues that divide the two
countries – as seen in the mixed reception that residents of this
diverse city gave to the Chinese leader, with both anti-communist
protesters and pro-Xi greeters lining the streets. On Wednesday, groups
in at least two locations descended into fisticuffs, as documented in
videos posted on social media.</p>
<p>Xi, in his brief remarks before the leaders began their meeting, said
the two nations are inextricably linked.</p>
<p>“For two large countries like China, the United States turning their
back on each other is not an option,” he said. “It is unrealistic for
one side to remodel the other. And conflict and confrontation has
unbearable consequences for both sides.</p>
<p>I’m still of the view that major country competition is not to the
prevailing trend of current times and cannot solve the problems facing
China and the United States or the world at large.</p>
<p>Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed and one
country’s success is an opportunity for the other.”</p>
<p>So did the presidents of the world’s two most powerful nations manage
to paper over the cracks in their relationship?</p>
<p>Biden spoke to the press afterwards. Xi, as is his habit, did
not.</p>
<p>The two did not release a joint statement.</p>
<p>“I welcome the positive steps we’ve taken today,” Biden said. ”And
it’s important for the world to see that we’re implementing the approach
in the best traditions of American diplomacy. We’re talking to our
competitors, just talking and being blunt with one another so there’s no
misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>Biden stopped far short of praising Xi, saying, “We have
disagreements. He has a different view than I have on a lot of things.
But he’s been straight. I don’t mean that good, bad or indifferent –
just been straight.”</p>
<p>In the administration’s post-meeting readout, the White House said
Biden repeated Washington’s long-held stance on Taiwan.</p>
<p>“President Biden emphasized that our one China policy has not changed
and has been consistent across decades and administrations,” the readout
said. “He reiterated that the United States opposes any unilateral
changes to the status quo from either side, that we expect cross-strait
differences to be resolved by peaceful means, and that the world has an
interest in peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He called for
restraint in the PRC’s use of military activity in and around the Taiwan
Strait.”</p>
<p>Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies in Washington, told VOA he was struck by the leaders’ words
on Taiwan.</p>
<p>“China often claims the U.S. is seeking to alter the status quo in
the Strait,” he said. “The opposite is true. Xi’s stark comments expose,
yet again, his desire to speed up reunification timetables, either
through military force or coercion.”</p>
<p>Many watching this meeting said they weren’t expecting major results,
but are glad the two leaders are talking.</p>
<p>“This engagement, for example, between President Biden and Xi
Jinping, to me it is critical because it should give a clear message
that we are here to be able to work together and trust each other to
resolve serious problems: Climate, issues in Ukraine or Gaza,” said
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. ”There are too many contentious
issues in the world and you must try and engage.”</p>
<p>Analysts say the success of the ongoing summit of Asia-Pacific
economies – happening simultaneously in San Francisco – depends on the
world’s two largest economies getting along.</p>
<p>“I think it’s an important meeting between President Biden and
President Xi, with the primary goal of stabilizing the relationship
heading into 2024,” said Michael Froman, president of the Council on
Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>“Both for bilateral purposes but also very importantly for the
broader APEC region. The countries there, the economies there, want the
U.S. and China to have some kind of modus vivendi, some kind of stable
relationship, particularly in anticipation of Taiwan’s election in
January, the U.S. election in November.”</p>
<p>Biden, when asked what he told Xi about Taiwan’s elections, said: “I
made clear I didn’t expect any interference.”</p>
<p>The Foundation for Defense of Democracies’ Singleton told VOA that he
interpreted Xi’s words on “peaceful coexistence” differently, saying it
“harkens back to Cold War-era language by Nikita Khrushchev, who
promoted the notion of ‘peaceful coexistence’ between the U.S. and
Soviet Union. Like today, previous policies aimed at stability
counter-intuitively extended the Soviet system’s survival, treating the
Soviet Union as an immutable juggernaut, rather than one whose demise
was inevitable.”</p>
<p>Biden said the leaders will continue to talk. And on Thursday, they
will give the other 19 Asia-Pacific economies a visual reminder of where
they each stand, when the leaders pose for the so-called “family photo”
— a ritual that is a hallmark of these major summits.</p>

Congress Approves Deal, Pushing Shutdown Threat to January</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ending the threat of a government shutdown until after the holidays,
Congress gave final approval Wednesday night to a temporary government
funding package that pushes a confrontation over the federal budget into
the new year.</p>
<p>The Senate met into the night to pass the bill with an overwhelming
87-11 tally and send it to President Joe Biden for his signature one day
after it passed the House on an overwhelming bipartisan vote. It
provides a funding patch into next year, when the House and Senate will
be forced to confront — and somehow overcome — their considerable
differences over what funding levels should be.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the bill removes the threat of a government shutdown
days before funding would have expired.</p>
<p>“This Friday night there will be no government shutdown,” Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a floor speech ahead of the final
vote.</p>
<p>The spending package keeps government funding at current levels for
roughly two more months while a long-term package is negotiated.
It splits the deadlines for passing full-year appropriations bills into
two dates: Jan. 19 for some federal agencies and Feb. 2 for others,
creating two deadlines where there will be a risk of a partial
government shutdown.</p>
<p>“Everybody is really kind of ready to vote and fight another day,”
Republican Whip John Thune, the No. 2 Republican, said earlier
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The spending package would keep government funding at current levels
for roughly two more months while a long-term package is negotiated.
It splits the deadlines for passing full-year appropriations bills into
two dates: Jan. 19 for some federal agencies and Feb. 2 for others,
creating two deadlines where there will be a risk of a partial
government shutdown.</p>
<p>The spending bill does not include the White House’s nearly $106
billion request for wartime aid for Israel and Ukraine, as well as
humanitarian funding for Palestinians and other supplemental requests.
Lawmakers are likely to turn their attention more fully to that request
after the Thanksgiving holiday in hopes of negotiating a deal.</p>
<p>Schumer called the stopgap funding plan “far from perfect,” but said
he would support it because it averts a shutdown and “will do so without
any of the cruel cuts or poison pills” that hardline conservatives
wanted.</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, who crafted the plan, has vowed that he
will not support any further stopgap funding measures, known as
continuing resolutions. He portrayed the temporary funding bill as
setting the ground for a spending “fight” with the Senate next year.</p>
<p>The new speaker, who told reporters this week that he counted himself
among the “arch-conservatives” of the House, is pushing for deeper
spending cuts. He wanted to avoid lawmakers being forced to consider a
massive government funding package before the December holidays — a
tactic that incenses conservatives in particular.</p>
<p>But Johnson is also facing pushback from other hardline conservatives
who wanted to leverage the prospect of a government shutdown to extract
steep cuts and policy demands.</p>
<p>Many of those conservatives were among a group of 19 Republicans who
defied Johnson Wednesday to prevent floor consideration of an
appropriations bill to fund several government agencies.</p>
<p>GOP leaders called off the week’s work after the vote, sending
lawmakers home early for Thanksgiving. It capped a period of intense
bickering among lawmakers.</p>
<p>“This place is a pressure cooker,” Johnson said Tuesday, noting that
the House had been in Washington for 10 weeks straight.</p>
<p>The House GOP’s inability to present a united front on funding
legislation could undercut the Louisiana congressman’s ability to
negotiate spending bills with the Senate.</p>
<p>Republicans are demanding that Congress work out government funding
through 12 separate bills, as the budgetary process requires, but House
leadership has so far been forced to pull two of those bills from the
floor, seen another rejected on a procedural vote and struggled to win
support for others.</p>
<p>When it returns in two weeks, Congress is expected to focus on the
Biden administration’s requests for Ukraine and Israel funding.
Republican senators have demanded that Congress pass immigration and
border legislation alongside additional Ukraine aid, but a bipartisan
Senate group working on a possible compromise has struggled to find
consensus.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell in a floor speech pledged
that Republicans would continue to push for policy changes on the U.S.
border with Mexico, saying it is “impossible to ignore the crisis at our
southern border that’s erupted on Washington Democrats’ watch.”</p>
<p>One idea floating among Republicans is directly tying Ukraine funding
levels with decreases in the number of illegal border crossings. It
showed how even longtime supporters of Ukraine’s defense against Russia
are willing to hold up the funding to force Congress to tackle an issue
that has flummoxed generations of lawmakers: U.S. border policy.</p>
<p>Most Senate Republicans support the Ukraine funding, said Sen. Kevin
Cramer, R-N.D., but he added, “It is secondary to securing our own
border.”</p>
<p>But the U.S. is already trimming some of the wartime aid packages it
is sending Ukraine as funds run low, National Security Council
spokesperson John Kirby said from San Francisco, where he accompanied
President Joe Biden for a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders.</p>
<p>He said the pot of money available for Ukraine is “withering away,
and with it will be a deleterious effect on Ukraine’s ability to
continue to defend itself.”</p>
<p>Schumer said the Senate would try to move forward on both the funding
and border legislation in the coming weeks, but warned it would require
a compromise.</p>
<p>“Both sides will have to give,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="classmates-beat-las-vegas-teen-17-to-death-police-say">10
Classmates Beat Las Vegas Teen, 17, to Death, Police Say</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A 17-year-old high school student in Las Vegas was beaten to death in
an alleyway around the corner from campus by 10 of his classmates
between the ages of 13 and 17, a prearranged fight that authorities said
broke out over a pair of headphones and a vape pen.</p>
<p>But police homicide Lt. Jason Johansson said that detectives think
the victim wasn’t originally supposed to be involved in the brawl, which
the students agreed would take place after classes were done for the day
at Rancho High School in eastern Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lewis Jr. walked to the alleyway with his friend, whose
headphones and vape pen had been stolen, Johansson said.</p>
<p>The deadly beating on Nov. 1 was captured on cellphone video and
widely shared on social media. Johansson described the footage as “very
void of humanity.”</p>
<p>In the video, he said, the victim is seen taking off his shirt to
prepare for the fight, and then the 10 students “immediately swarm him,
pull him to the ground and begin kicking, punching and stomping on
him.” </p>
<p>Eight of the students were arrested Tuesday by Las Vegas police and
the FBI on suspicion of murder. They were not immediately identified
because they are under 18. </p>
<p>Las Vegas police said they haven’t yet been able to identify the two
remaining students, who will also face murder charges. The police
department released images of the teenagers, asking for help from the
public to identify them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, as classes ended for the day and students
were leaving campus, a small memorial with flowers and eight candles sat
against a fence in the alleyway where Lewis was killed. </p>
<p>Rancho High School principal Darlin Delgado said in a letter this
week to parents that support and resources were available for students
and staff members as the beating “has and will continue to impact our
school community.”</p>
<p>Scott Coffee, a deputy public defender with 28 years of experience in
Las Vegas, said it is unusual to have so many co-defendants of such
young ages charged with murder in a single case. Coffee said he had not
seen court documents and does not represent any of the defendants.</p>
<p>“When kids are involved in this kind of activity, they take the risk
by being involved,” Coffee said. “But the flip side is this: Does it
look like anybody intended to kill anyone?”</p>
<p>A family court judge on Wednesday ordered four of the students who
are 16 or older to be transferred to the adult court system, the
Review-Journal reported. Hearings will be held at later dates to
determine if the students under 16 will be charged as adults.</p>
<p>Police and prosecutors will have to measure the level of culpability
for each of the 10 defendants as the case moves through the court
system, Coffee noted. </p>
<p>“Was there somebody in charge of this group? Was somebody younger
just going along with the older folks?” he said, adding that although
the students face similar charges at the time of their arrests, “it
doesn’t mean the resolutions are necessarily going to be similar.”</p>
<p>After the brawl, a person in the area found the teenager badly beaten
and unconscious in the alleyway and carried him back to campus, where
school staff called 911, police said.</p>
<p>Lewis was hospitalized with severe head trauma and other injuries
until his death a week later. The coroner’s office in Las Vegas ruled
the beating a homicide.</p>
<p>The victim’s father, Jonathan Lewis Sr., didn’t respond Wednesday to
requests for an interview. But on a fundraising page he created to help
with funeral and medical expenses, he wrote that his son was attacked
while standing up for his friend.</p>
<p>“Our son is a kind, loving, gentle young man who has the heart of a
champion and the brightest loving energy that attracts people to him
with love,” the page reads.</p>

Protest in Front of DC Democrat Headquarters, Calling for Gaza
Cease-Fire</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Police in the nation’s capital responded Wednesday night to a protest
outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee calling
for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>U.S. Capitol Police said about 150 people were “illegally and
violently protesting” near the DNC headquarters building in the Capitol
Hill neighborhood of Washington. Members of Congress were evacuated from
the building as the protest erupted.</p>
<p>Video posted on social media showed protesters shoving police
officers and trying to grab hold of metal barricades as the officers
moved in to make arrests. The videos also show officers shoving
protesters. Many of the protesters were wearing black shirts that read
“Cease Fire Now.”</p>
<p>Protesters included members of If Not Now and Jewish Voice for Peace,
who have organized other demonstrations in Washington.</p>
<p>If Not Now posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that “police are
being extremely violent.”</p>
<p>“We are linking arms, threatening no one, and begging our politicians
to support an end to the killing and the suffering in Gaza. Begging,
peacefully, for a cease-fire,” the group posted.</p>
<p>The clashes Wednesday evening are the latest example of roiling
tensions over the war between Israel and Hamas.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has been under increasing pressure from the
Democratic Party’s left flank over his support for Israel’s military
operation, including interruptions from protesters at his speeches. He
has resisted calls for a cease-fire, instead saying there should be
pauses in the fighting to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian
assistance and the potential extraction of hostages.</p>
<p>Last week, a large number of House Democrats joined nearly all
Republicans in voting to censure Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the only
Palestinian American in Congress, over her criticism of the Israeli
government’s treatment of Palestinians.</p>
<p>Tlaib, who has family in the West Bank, came under heavy criticism
after she failed to immediately condemn Hamas after the attack. She
since has called out the terrorist group while also calling for a
cease-fire.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police Department said its officers also responded
to the disturbance. Officials sent an alert to congressional staffers
telling them no one would be permitted to enter or exit any House office
buildings.</p>
<p>Rep. Brad Sherman, a California Democrat, said he was evacuated from
the building by police after protesters began “pepper-spraying police
officers and attempting to break into the building.”</p>

<h2 id="xi-invites-old-friends-from-iowa-to-california-dinner">Xi
Invites ‘Old Friends’ From Iowa to California Dinner</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Among the guests at a $2,000-a-plate dinner for Xi Jinping Wednesday
night was Luca Berrone, attending as a guest of the Chinese
government.</p>
<p>The Des Moines businessman worked with the volunteer-driven Iowa
Sister States program to establish a relationship with Hebei Province in
1983. It was a connection made with corn and solidified with soybeans by
an organization that “is dedicated to connecting Iowans with to the
world community.”</p>
<p>The group’s mission, it says “is to develop and implement programs
that promote the cultural, economic and other interests of Iowa and its
friends around the world.”</p>
<p>One of those friends rose decades later to become the leader of a 1.4
billion-person-strong global superpower while retaining a fondness for
the Iowans he met almost 40 years ago despite the mutual suspicion that
marks China’s relationship with the U.S.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1985, as the coordinator of the nonprofit Iowa
Sister States, Berrone hosted Xi, then party committee secretary of
Zhengding County, Hebei Province, and his delegation. Berrone arranged
their itinerary and escorted Xi for two weeks as they explored the
farmland around Muscatine, a city of about 24,000 people in southeast
Iowa.</p>
<p>The not-yet-famous Xi bunked in a bedroom in the home of a local
family, freed up because their son was away at college. That solution to
a logistical problem, Berrone told The Des Moines Register, is key to
Xi’s bond with Iowa.</p>
<p>“The only hotel available in Muscatine was all booked up. So I
reached out to Sarah Lande, who was on the (Iowa Sister States)
committee, and I asked if it was possible to organize home stays for the
Chinese delegation, and she was able to contact a few families that were
interested,” Berrone told the Register. “And it turned out those home
stays were a turning point in building those long-term friendships.”</p>
<p>The People’s Daily, the Chinese Communist Party’s official newspaper,
noted that the delegation “visited elderly people in the local
community, attended a birthday party, had six interviews with local
media outlets and attended five welcome banquets held by the U.S.
side.”</p>
<p>Berrone told VOA Mandarin on Monday afternoon that the five gentlemen
of Hebei Province were congenial and personable.</p>
<p>“President Xi was very curious and intelligent,” he told VOA
Mandarin. “I made sure they learned as much as possible about
agricultural methods, technology and processing.”</p>
<p>In addition, there was a hog roast, a boat trip on the Mississippi
River and rides on advanced farming equipment.</p>
<p>“We had a really good time in two weeks,” Berrone told Fortune. “We
were like the road movie — five or six guys on a road trip.”</p>
<p>While the term “old friend” is often used by China to pay tribute to
foreigners seen as beneficial to the interests of the Party, such as
Henry Kissinger, it also can also carry a nostalgic feeling shared by
longtime companions who respect and enjoy each others’ company.</p>
<p>Xi returned to Iowa in 2012, the year before he started his first
five-year term as president and met with Berrone along with other old
friends. Lande recalled Xi saying, “You were the first people I met in
America, and to me, you are America,” according to Fortune.</p>
<p>In October 2013, Iowa companies and organizations signed 20
cooperative trade agreements with Hubei Province counterparts with a
combined value touted at more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>In March 2019, when Xi visited Italy, then-Italian Prime Minister
Giuseppe Conte invited Berrone to welcome Xi, an event Berrone told VOA
Mandarin was a highlight of his life.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways-from-bidens-long-awaited-meeting-with-xi">Takeaways
From Biden’s Long-Awaited Meeting With Xi</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It was a meeting a year in the making.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping sat down
together on Wednesday just outside of San Francisco, where Asian leaders
gathered for an annual summit. It was almost exactly one year since
their last encounter in Bali, Indonesia, on the sidelines of another
global gathering.</p>
<p>In addition to a formal bilateral meeting, Biden and Xi shared a
lunch with top advisers and strolled the verdant grounds of the luxury
estate where their meeting took place.</p>
<p>There’s no word on whether Chinese pandas will return to Washington’s
zoo. But Biden said the meeting included “some of the most constructive
and productive discussions we’ve had.” Here’s a look at how the day
panned out.</p>
<p>New agreements</p>
<p>Biden left the meeting with commitments on key issues.</p>
<p>Xi agreed to help curb the production of the illicit fentanyl that is
a deadly component of drugs sold in the United States. A senior
administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to
discuss a private meeting, said the shift will be a setback for Latin
American drug dealers.</p>
<p>“It’s going to save lives, and I appreciated President Xi’s
commitment on this issue,” Biden said at a press conference after his
meeting.</p>
<p>In addition, Biden and Xi reached an agreement to resume
military-to-military communications. That means Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin will speak with his Chinese counterpart once someone is named to
the job, the official said. Similar engagements will take place up and
down the military chain of command.</p>
<p>The official said Biden was “very clear” to Xi that such
communications between U.S. and China should be institutionalized and
that they are “not done as a gift or as a favor to either side.”</p>
<p>Biden said the U.S. and China would talk more about artificial
intelligence as well.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get our experts together and discuss risk and safety
issues,” he said.</p>
<p>The agreements helped fulfill the White House’s goal for the meeting
— prove to voters that Biden’s dedication to personal diplomacy is
paying off.</p>
<p>On Sunday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN that
Biden wanted “practical ways” to show that meeting with Xi can help
“defend American interests and also deliver progress on the priorities
of the American people.”</p>
<p>Zoe Liu, a fellow for China studies at the Council for Foreign
Relations, described the meeting between Biden and Xi as a positive
step, albeit an incremental one.</p>
<p>“These agreements will not change the structural challenges in the
bilateral relations, but it paves the way for more detailed
working-level discussions, which is more important,” she said.</p>
<p>Economic challenges</p>
<p>Xi arrived in San Francisco at a time of economic challenges back in
China, where an aging population and growing debt have hampered its
recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>According to Beijing’s description of the meeting, Xi pressed Biden
to lift sanctions and change policies on export controls for sensitive
equipment.</p>
<p>“Stifling China’s technological progress is nothing but a move to
contain China’s high-quality development and deprive the Chinese people
of their right to development,” the readout said. “China’s development
and growth, driven by its own inherent logic, will not be stopped by
external forces.”</p>
<p>There’s no indication that Biden will agree to take such steps. But
even the meeting itself could calm jittery nerves back in China, where
there have been signs foreign investment is tapering off.</p>
<p>Zhang Lei, a Chinese businessman whose company, Cheche Group, is
listed on NASDAQ, said high-level meetings such as the one between Biden
and Xi can help assure companies that have been hesitant to invest in
China.</p>
<p>“Confrontations don’t work,” he said. “You don’t make money with
confrontations.”</p>
<p>It’s personal</p>
<p>Biden and Xi go back years, and Biden often repeats the story of
their meetings when they were both vice presidents.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, it was Xi’s turn to reference their previous
encounters during brief public remarks, although he eschewed the
embellishments that Biden usually adds to the tale.</p>
<p>“It was 12 years ago,” Xi said. “I still remember our interactions
very vividly, and it always gives me a lot of thoughts.”</p>
<p>Biden also emphasized the length of their relationship and the value
of their interactions.</p>
<p>“We haven’t always agreed, which was not a surprise to anyone, but
our meetings have always been candid, straightforward and useful,” Biden
said. He added, “It’s paramount that you and I understand each other
clearly, leader to leader, with no misconceptions or
miscommunication.”</p>
<p>Bilateral meetings aren’t always conducive to a personal touch, and
Biden and Xi were flanked by advisers on opposite sides of a long table.
However, a senior administration official said they spoke about their
wives, and Biden wished Xi’s wife a happy birthday.</p>
<p>The official, who requested anonymity to discuss a private
conversation, said Xi was embarrassed, and he admitted that he had
forgotten his wife’s upcoming birthday because he’s been working so
hard.</p>

Argue to Disqualify Trump From Colorado Ballot Over Jan. 6 Attack</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lawyers representing a group of Colorado voters delivered closing
arguments on Wednesday in a lawsuit seeking to disqualify former
President Donald Trump from the state’s ballot next year over his role
in the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his
supporters.</p>
<p>The voters are seeking to use the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment,
which bars officials who have engaged in “insurrection or rebellion”
from holding public office, to argue that Trump is ineligible to run for
president in 2024. The provision was ratified in 1868 following the U.S.
Civil War.</p>
<p>Sean Grimsley, a lawyer representing the voters, said the riot at the
Capitol was Trump’s “final desperate attempt to hold onto power in
violation of the Constitution.”</p>
<p>During his closing argument, Grimsley argued that Trump intended for
his supporters to resort to violence and added, “Through his actions and
his actions alone, Donald Trump has disqualified himself from ever
holding office again.”</p>
<p>The case represents a test of legal efforts to use the 14th Amendment
to block Trump’s candidacy. It is the first such case to go to
trial.</p>
<p>Scott Gessler, a lawyer for Trump, faulted plaintiffs in the case for
relying on the findings of the Democratic-led House committee that
investigated the Capitol riot, which he said was biased against
Trump.</p>
<p>“The petitioners are asking this court to do something that has never
been done in the history of the United States,” Gessler said. “The
evidence doesn’t come close to allowing the court to do it this
time.”</p>
<p>The House panel’s former top investigator, who testified during the
trial, defended the probe as impartial and open-minded.</p>
<p>The voters, represented in the case by the watchdog group Citizens
for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) and a group of
Colorado-based lawyers, sued Colorado’s secretary of state, the state’s
top elections official, in a bid to block Trump’s inclusion on the
ballot.</p>
<p>Trump is the front-runner for the Republican nomination to challenge
Democratic President Biden in the 2024 U.S. election.</p>
<p>Lawyers in the case on Wednesday made their final pitch to Colorado
District Court Judge Sarah Wallace, who will decide the case, following
a weeklong trial that featured testimony from U.S. lawmakers, legal
experts and Republican political activists.</p>
<p>Thousands of people stormed the Capitol in a failed attempt to
prevent Congress from certifying Biden’s 2020 victory over Trump. The
lawyers for the voters have sought to convince the judge that Trump’s
actions in spreading false claims of voter fraud, summoning his
supporters to Washington on the day of the riot and initially refusing
pleas to quell the violence amounted to an insurrection.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers have denied that he incited his supporters to
violence and have argued that disqualifying him from the ballot would
set a dangerous precedent.</p>
<p>Colorado is regarded as a safely Democratic state by nonpartisan
election forecasters.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Trump is on the ballot, Biden would be expected
to win there. But CREW and other activists are seeking to bring a series
of legal challenges to Trump’s eligibility based on the 14th Amendment
language.</p>
<p>Courts in Michigan and Minnesota have ruled that Trump can remain on
the ballot for the Republican primaries in those states but declined to
immediately decide on his eligibility for the November 2024 general
election.</p>
<p>The cases raise several unsettled legal questions. Many experts view
the effort as a legal longshot. The U.S. Supreme Court, whose 6-3
conservative majority includes three Trump appointees, may ultimately
weigh in.</p>

Participation at APEC Forum Offers Rare Chance to Break China’s
Bonds</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taiwan will take part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
in San Francisco this week, a rare opportunity for the self-governing
island democracy of 23 million people and its high-tech economy to break
the diplomatic embargo on it imposed by authoritarian China.</p>
<p>Taiwan’s chief delegate will be a civilian rather than a government
figure or head of state, under an unwritten rule that satisfies China’s
contention that members of the organization participate as economic
entities rather than state players.</p>
<p>For the seventh time, Taiwan will be represented by Morris Chang, the
92-year-old founder of the world-leading Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company. Chang is known as the godfather of the industry
that has put Taiwan in the top ranks of high-tech manufacturing and
personal electronic devices.</p>
<p>Taiwan has participated in APEC since 1991 under the name Chinese
Taipei. It began taking part just two years after the group’s inception
and the same year that China and the semi-autonomous Chinese city of
Hong Kong joined.</p>
<p>Taiwan has relied on retired ministers — and in Chang’s case,
industry leaders — who are well connected with the government but do not
carry the burden of formal office, which could spark a protest from
China. But that doesn’t mean Taiwan’s government won’t be represented.
Minister of Finance Chuang Tsui-yun will attend a meeting presided over
by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who recently visited Beijing,
and two other ministers will attend meetings on Tuesday and
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Taiwan a major topic</p>
<p>A Japanese colony until the end of World War II, Taiwan split from
mainland China amid a civil war in 1949. China continues to claim the
island as its territory, to be annexed by force if necessary, a threat
it plays out on a near-daily basis by sending ships and warplanes around
the island.</p>
<p>These acts of political intimidation have the potential to wear down
the operational resiliency of the island’s military equipment and
personnel. Taiwan has just a fraction of the air, sea and missile power
of China’s People’s Liberation Army, not to mention its ground forces,
and relies heavily on young men doing their mandatory national service
to fill its ranks.</p>
<p>However, Taiwan in recent years has invested heavily in upgraded arms
purchases from the U.S., along with boosting its own defense industry,
most notably building submarines that could undermine the Chinese naval
threat. That has come partly in response to Chinese displays of force
such as sailing aircraft carriers through the economically crucial
Taiwan Strait and sending aircraft and drones to circle the island.</p>
<p>While the U.S. has no military treaty with Taiwan, it is obligated
under federal law to ensure the island can defend itself and to treat
all threats to the island as matters of “grave concern.” That, along
with Washington’s string of alliances from Japan to South Korea and the
Philippines, and its refusal to recognize China’s claim to virtually the
entire South China Sea, make the Taiwan Strait a potential powder keg
should Chinese leader Xi Jinping seek to make good on his determination
to unite what he views as China’s historical territory and cement his
political legacy.</p>
<p>China primarily wants an end to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, including
latest model F-16 fighter jets, and an assurance it will not give an
electoral boost to the ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party.</p>
<p>U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Wednesday
that among the points that President Joe Biden will make clear to
President Xi is that the U.S., in accordance with its law, will continue
to provide “self-defense capabilities for Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Politics at play  </p>
<p>Even with China’s lackluster economic rebound from the COVID-19
pandemic, including high youth unemployment and massive debts born by an
overextended housing sector, Xi is pushing ahead with his vision for
China to reclaim its historical place as the center of cultural,
political and economic life in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>Taiwan, with its multiparty system focused mostly on local issues and
with a broad consensus favoring political separation from China,
presents a unique challenge to those who call the shots inside the
cloistered Qing Dynasty-era leadership compound of Zhongnanhai in
Beijing. Almost entirely male and shielded from the media, they brought
Hong Kong to heel after pro-democracy protests broke out in the former
British colony in 2019.</p>
<p>China has sought to influence Taiwanese politics through military
threats, but also by using a “carrot and stick” approach toward economic
opportunities on the mainland and by enticing politicians, chiefly from
the main Nationalist Party, also known as the Kuomintang, or KMT, to
meet with high-level officials in Beijing.  </p>
<p>Taiwanese media outlets have also been persuaded to run stories
critical of the status quo of de facto independence, mainly through
their ownership structures, which involve substantial investments on the
mainland.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to the voters in Taiwan. January’s
elections for the presidency and legislature will be the best
determinant of whether the populace wishes to stay the course or seek a
greater degree of accommodation with Beijing.  </p>
<p>Current Vice President William Lai appears to be in a strong position
to win at least a plurality of the vote in his bid for the presidency,
while his opposition appears splintered and unable to form the sort of
alliances that could put the U.S.-trained medical professional under
substantial pressure, despite the vast sums being spent on advertising
by rivals such as electronics magnate Terry Gou.</p>

<h2 id="us-approves-spacex-for-2nd-launch-of-starship-super-heavy">US
Approves SpaceX for 2nd Launch of Starship Super Heavy</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday granted Elon
Musk’s SpaceX a license to launch the company’s second test flight of
its next-generation Starship and heavy-lift rocket from Texas, the
agency said. </p>
<p>SpaceX said it was targeting Friday for a launch, saying a two-hour
launch window opens at 7 a.m. Central Time (1300 GMT) and that local
residents “may hear a loud noise” during the rocket’s ascent toward
space. </p>
<p>“The FAA determined SpaceX met all safety, environmental, policy and
financial responsibility requirements,” the agency, which oversees
commercial launch sites, said in a statement. </p>
<p>SpaceX’s first attempt to send Starship to space was in April, when
the rocket exploded mid-air four minutes after a liftoff that pulverized
the company’s launchpad and flung sand and concrete chunks for
miles. </p>
<p>Though Musk, SpaceX’s CEO and founder, hailed the Starship launch
attempt as exceeding his expectations, it fell far short of its overall
test objectives to reach space, complete nearly a full revolution around
Earth, and reenter the atmosphere for a splashdown off a Hawaiian
coast. </p>
<p>First the moon, eventually Mars</p>
<p>Starship, standing taller than the Statue of Liberty at 120 meters
and designed to be fully reusable, represents SpaceX’s next-generation
workhorse rocket system capable of ferrying some 150 tons of satellites
into space. Plans also call for the rocket system to be used to carry
crews of humans to the moon, and eventually Mars. </p>
<p>The rocket is crucial for SpaceX’s increasingly dominant launch
business. NASA, under a roughly $4 billion development contract with
SpaceX, plans to use Starship around 2026 to land the first crew of
humans on the moon’s surface since 1972. </p>
<p>Hundreds of fixes before launch</p>
<p>The upcoming Starship flight will have the same test objectives as
the first attempt. SpaceX made hundreds of fixes to the rocket’s design
based on the April failure. The FAA required SpaceX to make dozens of
fixes before allowing another Starship flight. </p>
<p>SpaceX determined that an onboard fire prevented Starship — the
rocket system’s upper stage — from separating from its Super Heavy first
stage booster as planned. The rocket’s explosion was the result of an
automated destruction command, which triggered some 40 seconds late.</p>

From wood gas to plastic waste
</h2>
<p>
During the Second World War,
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/01/wood-gas-vehicles-firewood-in-the-fuel-tank/">many
motorized vehicles in continental Europe were converted to drive on
firewood</a>.
<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
That happened as a consequence of the rationing of fossil fuels. Wood
gas vehicles were a not-so-elegant alternative to their petrol cousins,
but their range was comparable to today’s electric vehicles. In Germany
alone, around 500,000 wood gas cars, buses, and trucks operated by the
end of WWII. An even more cumbersome alternative was the
<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/11/gas-bag-vehicles/">gas
bag vehicle</a>.
<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Nowadays, there’s much less firewood available than in the 1940s,
especially in industrialized regions. So, what would be the solution to
the disruption of gasoline or electricity in the Third World War? Dutch
artist <a href="https://gijsschalkx.nl">Gijs Schalkx</a> found another
fuel supply, which is abundant: plastic waste. The production of
plastics only started in the 1950s, after the Second World War. Since
then, plastic has become an increasingly popular material, growing to a
global annual production of 460 million metric tons in 2019 – twice as
much as in 2000 and eight times as much as in 1976.
<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>

<p>
Plastics are made from fossil fuels, and the process can be turned
around. Gijs Schalkx converted an abandoned Volvo 240 to run on diesel
that he makes from the plastic waste he collects. The “de-refinery”
converts plastic waste back into fuel and is installed on the luggage
carrier of the car, making the vehicle independent of the fossil fuel
infrastructure. The plastic waste is heated in a boiler to about 700
degrees Celsius, after which it evaporates. The gas is then cooled down,
and turns into a diesel-like liquid one hour later. Gijs collects it in
plastic bottles – themselves the raw material for the diesel they
contain. The fuel looks like Coca-Cola – one of the largest producers of
plastic waste.
</p>
<h2 id="how-far-can-we-drive-on-plastic-waste">
How far can we drive on plastic waste?
</h2>
<p>
Making fuel can happen while the car drives, but Gijs has kept the two
activities separate for safety reasons. At a speed of 80 km/u, his Volvo
240 drives a distance of 7 kilometres per kilogram of plastic (which
corresponds to 14 kg of plastic per 100 km driven). That includes the
fuel used to heat up the plastic waste on the roof (1 kg of plastic
gives 0.5 liter of diesel). Plastic waste is a rather voluminous
material, and it takes several garbage bags full of plastic waste to
make one liter of fuel. Schalkx plans to use a small shredder to reduce
the volume of the plastic waste he collects, but for now he relies on a
supply of discarded plastic granulate from a neighbour, consisting of
PET and HDPE.

How far could we drive if we would convert all plastic waste into fuel?
The Netherlands produced roughly 1,650 kiloton of plastic waste in 2017
(1,650,000,000 kg), enough to drive 11.55 billion km (11,550,000,000
km).
<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
That corresponds to about 1/10th of kilometers driven by all passenger
cars in the Netherlands in 2021 (114.3 billion km).
<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
On a smaller scale, the average passenger vehicle in the Netherlands
drives 12,000 km per year, requiring each driver and their passengers to
collect 1,714 kg of plastic. On the other hand, even the current amount
of plastic waste per capita in the Netherlands (97 kg) would be enough
to drive 679 km – perhaps sufficient for those who use their automobile
wisely. The amount of plastic waste grows faster than the number of cars
so that we could drive increasingly longer distances in the future.

<h2 id="how-sustainable-is-driving-on-plastic-waste">
How sustainable is driving on plastic waste?
</h2>
<p>
Being able to drive a vehicle on plastic waste has benefits in terms of
resilience. For example, it could allow medics to operate ambulances
without a regular fuel supply in a war zone. However, how does a vehicle
driven on plastic waste performs in times of peace? After all, plastic
waste is a huge problem, and Gijs Schalkx’s car gets rid of it. With
less than 10% of plastic waste recycled worldwide, would it make sense
to encourage people to convert their vehicles to run on diesel oil made
of plastic waste? Sure, it would be a more affordable alternative to
electric cars, but what about the carbon emissions?
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, the embodied carbon emissions of the Volvo 240 are
almost zero: Gijs found most components – including the car itself – in
the dump, others on the second-hand market.
<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
In contrast, manufacturing new vehicles – especially electric ones –
adds a significant carbon footprint before they drive their first
kilometer. They also need an extensive infrastructure to produce and
distribute fuel and electricity, adding more carbon emissions. In
contrast, the Volvo has its fuel infrastructure on the roof, built from
scrap.

<p>
On the other hand, the CO2-emissions from the fuel production and the
fuel combustion are not praiseworthy. First, there is the burning of
plastic on the roof of the car. Making 1 liter of diesel requires the
burning of 1 kg of plastic, which results in 2-2.7 kg carbon emissions.
<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>
Second, there is the combustion of the diesel fuel while driving, which
emits 2.7 kg of carbon dioxide per liter.
<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>
Together, that becomes 4.7 to 5.4 kg CO2 per liter. Consequently, with a
14:1 fuel economy, the Volvo emits 65.8 to 75.6 kg of greenhouse gases
per 100 km.
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the emissions of the average fossil fuel powered car in
Europe amount to 25.8 kg/100 km, including crude oil production, fuel
refining and vehicle manufacturing.
<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>
The emissions of a small electric car like the Nissan Leaf amount to
10.9 kg/100km in Europe, including the emissions of the fuel that is
burned to produce the electricity.
<sup id="fnref1:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>
The Volvo thus emits 2.5 times more CO2 than the average fossil fuel
powered car in Europe, and 7 times more than a small electric car. The
difference will be somewhat smaller, because the data for the other cars
do not include the emissions for building the oil and power
infrastructure. However, this is unlikely to tip the balance.
</p>
<p>
There are several reasons for the high carbon emissions. First, fuel
production by burning plastic on the roof is four times more carbon
intensive than producing fuel from crude oil in a refinery.
<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>
Second, the Volvo dates from 1980, when cars had lower fuel economy.
Gijs Schalkx: “Hypothetically, you could convert a newer car to drive on
plastic waste and have much lower carbon emissions. Likewise, the
de-refinery is one of the first of its kind and could be made more
efficient by real engineers. Oil refineries have been developped for
more than 100 years. However, newer cars have proprietary electronic
motor controls that prevent using alternative fuels.”
</p>
<h2 id="externalizing-pollution">
Externalizing pollution
</h2>
<p>
Carbon emissions are not the only worry. Because of the chemicals added
to plastic, burning it to make fuel creates a lot of nasty air
pollution. Nobody in their right mind will propose a switch to cars
fuelled by plastic waste. However, it is instructive to examine the
motives behind this unanimous conclusion. Much of the plastic waste that
the Volvo 240 burns burns anyways. Not in cars but incinerators. That is
the case for 44% of plastic waste in Europe.
<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>
That plastic waste burns to produce electricity, which can then charge
electric cars. How is that more sustainable than burning plastic on the
roof of your car?
</p>

<p>
The carbon emissions are the same. So is the air pollution, although
it’s easier to put a flue gas scrubber on thousands of incinerators than
on millions of cars. The main difference is that burning plastic waste
in incinerators to power electric cars allows many of us to
<em>externalize</em> the side effects of car driving. An incinerator can
be (and always is) located in a poor neighbourhood, where it causes high
incidences of cancer and other health problems in spite of air pollution
control. Meanwhile, it produces electricity that charges electric cars
which drive around low emission zones in well-to-do neighbourhoods.
</p>
<h2 id="internalizing-pollution">
Internalizing pollution
</h2>
<p>
In contrast, Schalkx’s Volvo <em>internalizes</em> all the side effects
of driving automobiles. The car is not a pleasure to drive, at least not
regularly. It is dirty. Its interior stinks of plastic, which cannot be
healthy – Gijs keeps the car windows open no matter the weather.
Furthermore, he needs to spend a lot of time collecting plastic and
making fuel, and all these disadvantages make him think twice before he
gets behind the wheel. It’s unlikely that Schalkx will drive 12,000 km
per year, and so, ultimately, he will produce less pollution than the
drivers of more sustainable-looking cars that face none of these
problems.
</p>
<p>
Somehow, the Dutch authorities, who are not known for their
permissivity, officially approved the car after inspection. Schalkx
drives tax-free and – thanks to his car being an oldtimer – can enter
low-emission zones, where he parks alongside the latest electric SUV.
Justice is not yet out of this world.

id="bangladesh-politician-faces-discipline-over-threat-against-us-envoy">Bangladesh
Politician Faces Discipline Over Threat Against US Envoy</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called for steps to be
taken against an official in her party who threatened to physically
assault Peter Haas, the U.S. ambassador to Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The official justified his words by claiming that Haas was working in
the interest of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP,
ahead of elections scheduled for early January.</p>
<p>While it was not disclosed exactly what action has been ordered,
Bangladesh’s junior foreign affairs minister, Shahriar Alam, confirmed
in front of local reporters in Dhaka on Friday that the prime minister
has directed action against the official.</p>
<p>In a video clip that went viral on social media last week, Mujibul
Haque Chowdhury, chairman of a unit of Hasina’s Awami League in a
Chittagong subdivision, was seen hurling threats and insults at the
American ambassador at a political meeting on November 6.</p>
<p>“Peter Haas said he wants to see a free and fair election here. I
say, ‘Peter Haas, you are as knowledgeable as a newborn, while we are
the actual grown-ups,’” Chowdhury said in the video. “You have no idea
what we are capable of. You will know just how dangerous we are once we
bash you up.”</p>
<p>Chowdhury added: “To the BNP members, you are a god, a savior. But we
are not scared of you. You cannot harm us in any way.”</p>
<p>As the video spread on social media, Hasina directed her party
colleagues to discipline Choudhury at an AL Central Committee meeting
Thursday.</p>
<p>Obaidul Quader, the general secretary of her party, acknowledged
afterward that Chowdhury’s comments about the ambassador were
abusive.</p>
<p>“Peter Haas, as an ambassador, is a respectable person. Mujibul Haque
Chowdhury’s comment, as it surfaced in the media, is rude and indecent.
We will take disciplinary action against him for his misconduct,” Quader
said in a press briefing.</p>
<p>US seeking free and fair election</p>
<p>The 2014 general elections in Bangladesh were boycotted by the BNP.
The next general elections, in 2018, were marred by allegations of
massive vote stuffing by the AL.</p>
<p>Since 2022, the United States and other countries have been urging
the Hasina government to hold the next general election, set for January
7, in a free and fair manner.</p>
<p>In September, the U.S. government announced that it had started
“taking steps to impose visa restrictions” on Bangladeshi individuals
who are found complicit in “undermining the democratic electoral
process” in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>During a visit to the U.S. in September, Hasina said at a New York
press conference that every time her party has come to power, it was
through a fair democratic process. “We indeed want the next general
elections to be free and fair,” she said.</p>
<p>However, the BNP, the largest opposition party in Bangladesh, insists
that the general election will not be free and fair if it is held under
the Hasina government, and has said it will not participate unless a
nonpartisan caretaker government is installed for the election
period.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Haas has met several Bangladeshi government
officials, ruling party leaders and the election commissioners. He
reportedly conveyed a message from the U.S. government that it seriously
wants the next general election in Bangladesh to be free and fair.</p>
<p>Over the past weeks, several leaders of the AL and its various wings
and allies have expressed irritation, directly and indirectly alleging
that Haas is working in support of the BNP.</p>
<p>“How will Peter Hass help you [the BNP]? Will he impose visa
restrictions, sanctions? We have already had talks with his superiors in
the U.S. Everything has been settled, and we are going to hold the
elections following our plan,” Quader, the party general secretary, said
last month.</p>
<p>“We will not allow you to carry out violent activities and disrupt
elections by using Peter Haas,” Quader said.</p>
<p>Calls for ambassador to be replaced</p>
<p>Last week, Hasanul Haq Inu, a former minister and political ally of
the AL, called for the removal of Haas from Bangladesh.</p>
<p>U.S. President “Joe Biden’s representative Peter Haas, who is the
‘newly appointed adviser of BNP,’ is acting in support of the BNP by
supporting the killing of a policeman,” Inu said in a speech. He was
referring to the death of a policeman during an outbreak of violence at
a BNP rally in Dhaka on October 28.</p>
<p>“Peter Haas is the supporter of the BNP, the killer of the policeman.
He does not deserve to continue as the ambassador of the friendly nation
of America,” Inu said.</p>
<p>“I call on the Bangladesh government to declare Peter Haas persona
non grata, for indulging in undiplomatic activities, interfering in
Bangladesh’s internal politics and supporting the dastardly killing of a
policeman. The government should tell its U.S. counterpart to replace
him with a new ambassador immediately.”</p>
<p>Haas has denied any U.S. interest in who wins the election. “I want
to make one thing very clear,” he said in September. “That the U.S. does
not support any political party. What we do want is a free and fair
election in accordance with international standards so that people of
Bangladesh can freely choose their own government.”</p>
<p>Attack on ambassador “deeply disturbing”</p>
<p>Ali Riaz, professor of political science at Illinois State
University, said that while any individual has the right to criticize
the policies of any government, a “personal attack on the envoy of that
country is deeply disturbing.”</p>
<p>“The ruling party leaders and activists are angry with the U.S.
because they see the current U.S. policy towards Bangladesh as an
obstacle to holding an election according to their plan. Their anger is
both spontaneous and orchestrated,” Riaz told VOA.</p>
<p>“Those who are beneficiaries of the present system are spontaneously
angry in fear of losing these benefits,” he said. “Others are motivated
by [suspicions] that the U.S. has a regime change agenda. They think
that the U.S. is out to get its leaders and trying to depose the Hasina
government.”</p>
<p>Mohammad Ashrafuzzaman of the Capital Punishment Justice Project, who
has been documenting human rights abuses in Bangladesh for over a
decade, said that Haas has “become a target of the regime” for being the
most prominent foreign diplomat “supporting people’s aspirations for
democratization and human rights” in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>He noted that former U.S. Ambassador Marcia Bernicat escaped an
attack in Dhaka a few months ahead of the 2018 general elections. Police
subsequently identified many of the assailants as leaders and activists
of the AL and its student wing, Chhatra League.</p>
<p>On Friday, the U.S. State Department told VOA it has raised
Chowdhury’s remarks at the highest levels of the Bangladesh government
in Dhaka as well as with the Bangladesh Embassy in Washington.</p>
<p>“The safety and security of our diplomatic personnel and facilities
are of the utmost importance. While we don’t comment on specific
information regarding our security posture, the Diplomatic Security
Service has a robust security program at each post tailored to each
mission’s specific needs,” a State Department spokesperson wrote in an
exchange of emails.</p>
<p>“Given the charged political atmosphere in Bangladesh, we expect that
the government of Bangladesh will take all appropriate measures to
maintain the safety and security of all U.S. missions and personnel in
the country, per its obligations under the Vienna Convention on
Diplomatic relations.”</p>

Big Train managers earn bonuses for greenlighting unsafe cars (15 Nov
2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Big Train managers earn bonuses for greenlighting
unsafe cars: The blood-curdling near-misses we don’t hear about. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2013,
2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances,
current writing projects, current reading Big Train managers earn
bonuses for greenlighting unsafe cars (permalink) Almost no one knows
this, but last June, a 90-car train got away from its crew in Hernando,
MO, rolling three miles through two public crossings, a ghost train that
included 47 potentially explosive propane cars. The “bomb train” neither
crashed nor derailed, which meant that Grenada Railroad/Gulf &amp;
Atantic didn’t have to report it. This is just one of many terrifying
near-misses that are increasingly common in America’s
hyper-concentrated, private equity-dominated rail sector, where unsafe
practices dominate and whistleblowers face brutal retaliation for coming
forward to regulators. These unsafe practices – and the corporate
policies that deliberately gave rise to them – are documented in
terrifying, eye-watering detail in a deeply reported Propublica story by
Topher Sanders, Jessica Lussenhop,Dan Schwartz, Danelle Morton and
Gabriel Sandoval:
https://www.propublica.org/article/railroad-safety-union-pacific-csx-bnsf-trains-freight
It’s a tale of depraved indifference to public safety, backstopped by
worker intimidation. The reporting is centered on railyard maintenance
inspectors, who are charged with writing up “bad orders” to prevent
unsafe railcars from shipping out. As private equity firms consolidated
rail into an ever-dwindling number of companies, these workers face
supervisors who are increasingly hostile to these bad orders. It got so
alarming that some staffers started carrying hidden digital recorders,
so they could capture audio of their bosses illegally ordering them to
greenlight railcars that were too unsafe for use. The article features
direct – and alarming – quotes, like supervisor Andrew Letcher, boss of
the maintenance crews at Union Pacific’s Kansas City yard saying, “If I
was an inspector on a train I would probably let some of that nitpicky
shit go.” Letcher – and fellow managers for other Tier 1 railroads
quoted in the piece – aren’t innately hostile to public safety. They are
quite frank about why they want inspectors to “let that nitpicky shit
go.” As Letcher explains, “The first thing that I’m getting questioned
about right now, every day, is why we’re over 200 bad orders and what
we’re doing to get them down.” In other words, corporate rail owners
have ordered their supervisors to reduce the amount of maintenance
outages on the rail lines, but have not given them additional
preventative maintenance budgets or crew. These supervisors warn their
employees that high numbers of bad orders could cost them their jobs,
even lead to the shutdown of the car shops where inspectors are prone to
pulling dangerous cars out of service. It’s a ruthless form of
winnowing. Gresham’s Law holds that “bad money drives out good” – in an
economy where counterfeit money circulates, people preferentially spend
their fake money to get it out of their hands, until all the money in
circulation is funny money. This is the rail safety equivalent: simply
fire everyone who reports unsafe conditions and all your railcars will
be deemed safe, with the worst railcars shipped out first. A market for
lemons – except these aren’t balky used sedans, they’re unsafe railcars
full of toxic chemicals or explosive propane. When cataclysmic rail
disasters occur – like this year’s East Palestine derailment – the rail
industry reassures us that this is an isolated incident, pointing to the
system’s excellent overall safety record. But that record is a mirage,
because the near-misses don’t have to be reported. Those near-misses are
coming more frequently, as the culture of profit over safety incurs a
mounting maintenance debt, filling America’s rails with potential “bomb
cars.” Rail mergers and other forms of deregulated, anything-goes
capitalism are justified by conservative economists who insist that
“incentives matter,” and that the profit motive provides the incentive
to improve efficiency, leading to lower costs and better service. But
the incentive to externalize risk, kick the can down the road, and
capture regulators rarely concerns the “incentives matter” crowd. Here’s
an incentive that matters. Rail managers’ bonuses – as much as a fifth
of their take home pay – are only paid if the trains they oversee run on
time. Inspectors have recorded their managers admitting that they have
quotas – a maximum number of bad orders their facility may produce,
irrespective of how much unsafe rolling stock passes through the
facility. Inspectors have caught their managers removing repair order
tags from cars they’ve flagged as unsafe. Inspectors will log orders in
a database, only to have the record mysteriously deleted, or marked as
serviced when no service has occurred. Some inspectors have seen the
same cars in their yard with the same problems, and repeatedly flagged
them without any maintenance being performed before they’re shipped out
again. Former managers from Union Pacific, CSX and Norfolk Southern told
Propublica that they operated in an environment where safety reports
were discouraged, and that workers who filed these reports were viewed
as “complainers.” Workers furnished Propublica with recordings of rail
managers berating them for reporting persistent unsafe conditions to the
Federal Railroad Administration. Other workers from BNSF said that they
believed that their bosses were told when they called the company’s
“confidential” work-safety tipline, setting them up for retaliation by
bosses who’d falsified safety reports. Whistleblowers who seek justice
at OSHA are stymied by long delays, and while switching their cases to
court can win them cash settlements, these do not get recorded on the
company’s safety record, which allows the company to go on claiming to
be a paragon of safety and prudence. The culture of retaliation is
pervasive, which explains how the 47-cars worth of propane on the “bomb
train” that rolled unattended over three miles of track never made the
news. There is a voluntary Close Call Reporting System (operated by
NASA!) where rail companies can report these disasters. Not one of
America’s Class 1 rail companies participate in it. After the East
Palestine disaster, Transport Secretary Pete Buttigieg pushed the rail
companies to join, but a year later, none have. It’s part of an overall
pattern with Secretary Buttigieg, who has prodigious, far-reaching
powers under USC40 Section 41712(a), which allow him to punish companies
for “unfair and deceptive” practices or “unfair methods of competition”:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge
Buttigieg can’t simply hand down orders under 41712(a) – to wield this
power, he must follow administrative procedures, conducting market
studies, seeking comment, and proposing a rule. Other members of the
Biden administration with similar powers, like FTC chair Lina Khan,
arrived in office with a ranked-priority list of bad corporate conduct
and immediately set about teeing up rules to give relief to the American
public. By contrast, Buttigieg’s agency has done precious little to
establish the evidentiary record to punish the worst American companies
under its remit. His most-touted achievement was to fine five airlines
for saving money by cancelling their flights and stranding their
passengers. But of the five airlines affected by Buttigieg’s order, four
were not US companies. The sole affected US carrier was Spirit airlines,
with 2% of the market. The Big Four US airlines – who have a much worse
record than the ones that were fined – were not affected at all:
https://prospect.org/infrastructure/transportation/ftc-noncompete-airline-flight-cancellation-buttigieg/
Rather than directly regulating the US transportation sector, Buttigieg
prefers exacting nonbinding promises from them (like the Tier 1 rail
companies’ broken promise to sign up to the Close Call Reporting
System). Under his leadership, the Federal Railroad Agency has proposed
weakening rail safety standards, rescinding an order to improve the
braking systems on undermaintained, mile-long trains carrying
potentially deadly freight:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/11/dinah-wont-you-blow/#ecp The US
transportation system is accumulating a terrifying safety debt, behind a
veil of corporate secrecy. It badly demands direct regulation and close
oversight. If you are interested in rail safety, I strongly recommend

disasters, with slides” – you will laugh your head off and then never

<h2
id="nickel-miners-environmentalists-learn-to-live-together-in-michigan">Nickel
Miners, Environmentalists Learn to Live Together in Michigan</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>It began as a familiar old story.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, multinational mining giant Rio Tinto came to the
wilds of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula to dig a nickel mine.</p>
<p>Environmentalists feared pollution. The company promised jobs.</p>
<p>The usual battle lines were drawn. The usual legal fights ensued.</p>
<p>But this time, something different happened.</p>
<p>The mining company invited a respected local environmental group to
be an independent watchdog, conducting pollution testing that goes above
and beyond what regulators require.</p>
<p>More than a decade has passed, and no major pollution problems have
arisen. Community opposition has softened.</p>
<p>“I was fiercely opposed to the mine, and I changed,” said Maura
Davenport, board chair of the Superior Watershed Partnership, the
environmental group doing the testing.</p>
<p>The agreement between the mining company and the environmentalists is
working at a time when demand for nickel and other metals used in green
technologies is on the rise, but the mining activity that supplies those
metals faces fierce local resistance around the world.</p>
<p>Historic mines, polluting history</p>
<p>The shift to cleaner energy needs copper to wire electrical grids,
rare earth elements for wind turbine magnets, lithium for electric
vehicle batteries, nickel to make those batteries run longer, and more.
Meeting the goals of the 2015 U.N. Paris climate agreement would mean a
fourfold increase in demand for metals overall by 2040 and a 19-fold
increase in nickel, according to the International Energy Agency.</p>
<p>That means more mines. But mines rarely open anywhere in the world
without controversy. Two nearby copper-nickel mine proposals hit major
roadblocks this year over environmental concerns.</p>
<p>For the third year running, mining companies listed environmental,
social and governance issues as the leading risk facing their businesses
in a survey by consulting firm EY.</p>
<p>Mining is not new to the Upper Peninsula, the northern tip of the
state of Michigan that is mostly surrounded by the Great Lakes. The
region was the nation’s leading copper and iron producer until the late
1800s. An open-pit iron mine still operates about 20 kilometers (12
miles) southwest of the college town of Marquette.</p>
<p>Most of the historic copper mines closed in the 1930s. But the waste
they left behind is still polluting today.</p>
<p>Residue left over from pulverizing copper ore, known as stamp sands,
continues to drift into Lake Superior, leaching toxic levels of copper
into the water.</p>
<p>“The whole history of mining is so bad, and we feared … for our
precious land,” Davenport said.</p>
<p>The ore Rio Tinto sought is in a form known as nickel sulfide. When
those rocks are exposed to air and water, they produce sulfuric acid.
Acid mine drainage pollutes thousands of kilometers of water bodies
across the United States. At its worst, it can render a stream nearly
lifeless.</p>
<p>When Rio Tinto proposed building the Eagle Mine about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) northwest of Marquette, “it divided our community,” Davenport
said.</p>
<p>“The Marquette community was against the mine,” she said, but the
“iron ore miners, they were all about it.”</p>
<p>Mining dilemma</p>
<p>It’s the same story the world over, according to Simon Nish, who
worked for Rio Tinto at the time.</p>
<p>“Communities are faced with this dilemma,” Nish said. “We want jobs,
we want economic benefit. We don’t want long-term environmental
consequences. We don’t really trust the regulator. We don’t trust the
company. We don’t trust the activists. … In the absence of trusted
information, we’re probably going to say no.”</p>
<p>Nish came from Australia, where a legal reckoning had taken place in
the 1990s over the land rights of the country’s indigenous peoples.
Early in his career, he worked as a mediator for the National Native
Title Tribunal, which brokered agreements between Aboriginal peoples and
resource companies who wanted to use their land.</p>
<p>It was a formative experience.</p>
<p>“On the resource company side, you can crash through and get a
short-term deal, but that’s actually not benefiting anybody,” he said.
“If you want to get a long-term outcome, you’ve actually really got to
understand the interests of both sides.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely skeptical”</p>
<p>When Nish arrived in Michigan in 2011, Rio Tinto’s Eagle Mine was
under construction but faced multiple lawsuits from community
opponents.</p>
<p>In order to quell the controversy, Nish knew that Rio Tinto needed a
partner that the community could trust. So he approached the Superior
Watershed Partnership with an unusual offer. The group was already
running programs testing local waterways for pollution. Would they be
willing to discuss running a program to monitor the mine?</p>
<p>“We were surprised. We were skeptical. Absolutely skeptical,”
Davenport said. But they agreed to discuss it.</p>
<p>SWP insisted on full, unfettered access to monitor “anything, any
time, anywhere,” Nish said.</p>
<p>SWP’s position toward Rio Tinto was “very, very clear,” he recalled:
“‘We’ve spent a long time building our reputation, our credibility here.
We aren’t going to burn it for you guys.’”</p>
<p>Over the course of several months — “remarkably fast,” as these
things go, Nish said — the environmental group and the mining company
managed to work out an agreement.</p>
<p>SWP would monitor the rivers, streams and groundwater for pollution
from the mine and the ore-processing mill 30 kilometers (19 miles)
south. It would test food and medicinal plants important for the local
Native American tribe. And it would post the results of these and other
tests online for the public to see.</p>
<p>And Rio Tinto would pay for the work. A respected local community
foundation would handle the funds. Rio Tinto’s funding would be at arm’s
length from SWP.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to be on their payroll,” said Richard Anderson, who
chaired the SWP board at the time. “That could not be part of the
structure.”</p>
<p>Not over yet</p>
<p>The agreement launching the Community Environmental Monitoring
Program was signed in 2012. More than a decade later, no major pollution
problems have turned up.</p>
<p>But other local environmentalists are cautious.</p>
<p>“I do think [Eagle Mine is] really trying to do a good job
environmentally,” said Rochelle Dale, head of the Yellow Dog Watershed
Preserve, another local environmental group that has opposed the
mine.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, a lot of the sulfide mines in the past haven’t
really had a problem until after closure.</p>
<p>“It’s something that our grandchildren are going to inherit,” she
said.</p>
<p>As demand for metals heats up, opposition to new mines is not cooling
off. Experts say mining companies are wising up to the need for
community buy-in. Eagle Mine’s Community Environmental Monitoring
Program points to one option, but also its limitations.</p>
<p>So far, so good. But the story’s not over yet.</p>

Congress Pushes Myanmar Aid Debate Into Early 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The debate over U.S. humanitarian aid to Myanmar will remain
unresolved until at least early next year, as U.S. lawmakers once again
this week delayed passage of a final budget for 2024.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers are expected to pass a short-term continuing
resolution that will fund the government at current levels through early
next year that includes the BURMA Act, passed as part of the 2023
National Defense Authorization or NDAA.</p>
<p>But the 2024 version of the budget will require the Senate and the
House to reconcile differing visions of how to proceed with aid to
Myanmar, also known as Burma.</p>
<p>The version of the 2024 budget produced by the Democratic-majority
U.S. Senate would appropriate more money to funding humanitarian
assistance and democracy promotion programs in Myanmar.</p>
<p>But activists have expressed concern about the delay and the version
of the budget passed by the Republican-majority House of Representatives
that would defund some programs.</p>
<p>“We are urging that Congress appropriate sufficient money to
implement the BURMA Act while continuing essential assistance in the
face of ongoing political and humanitarian crisis in Burma,” the
Campaign for a New Myanmar said in a statement.</p>
<p>In its annual 2024 fiscal year markup of the State, Foreign
Operations and Related Programs budget, released in July of this year,
U.S. House lawmakers recommended $50 million to implement the current
BURMA Act while also recommending a reduction of $1.4 billion for the
U.S. Agency for International Development or USAID’s development
assistance.</p>
<p>In July 2023, Myanmar’s National Unity Government, a shadow
administration run from hiding and exile vying to oust the junta, and a
trio of allied ethnic minority rebel armies, told VOA they had asked the
U.S. Congress for $525 million in aid, including $200 million in
nonlethal humanitarian aid. That number would be four times the $136
million previously appropriated by Congress.</p>
<p>Current Myanmar funding</p>
<p>The Burma Unification through Rigorous Military Accountability or
BURMA Act was a response to the February 1, 2021, coup in which
Myanmar’s democratically elected government was deposed by the
military.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell – a leading voice in the U.S.
Congress supporting democracy in Myanmar – marked the second anniversary
of the coup on the Senate floor by praising the BURMA Act.</p>
<p>“It made sanctions on senior junta officials mandatory,” McConnell
said in February 2023, “Finally, the NDAA also notably authorized
funding for programs to strengthen federalism in and among ethnic states
in Burma, and for technical support and non-lethal assistance to Burma’s
ethnic armed organizations and People’s Defense Forces to strengthen
communication, command and control, and coordination of international
relief and other operations between these entities.”</p>
<p>According to the Stimson Center, a non-partisan think tank, “it
remains unclear if any new programs were created since December 2022. At
this point, the U.S. continues to promote humanitarian aid as its
unchanged policy towards Myanmar.”</p>
<p>The United States has provided “nearly $2.1 billion since the
military’s genocide and crimes against humanity towards the Rohingya
that led 740,000 Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh in 2017,”
Michael Schiffer, assistant administrator of the Bureau for Asia at the
U.S. Agency for International Development, told House lawmakers in
September 2023.</p>
<p>Late last month, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that starting
in December, it will prohibit Americans from providing financial
services to or for Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise. The Treasury
Department also sanctioned three new entities and five individuals
connected to Myanmar’s military regime.</p>
<p>Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee and the author of the BURMA Act, praised the move in a
statement.</p>
<p>“These sanctions will disrupt the junta’s access to the U.S.
financial system and curtail its ability to commit further human rights
violations. The United States and our partners must utilize all
diplomatic and economic tools at our disposal to compel the junta to
cease its atrocities, release unjustly detained individuals, facilitate
unimpeded humanitarian access, and chart a pathway back toward
democracy,” Meeks said.</p>

Wildly Complex Energy Transition, Explained in 8 Charts</h2>

<p class="drop-caps" style>
Ahead of President Biden’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in
San Francisco on Wednesday, the U.S. and China released a
<a href="https://www.state.gov/sunnylands-statement-on-enhancing-cooperation-to-address-the-climate-crisis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">joint
statement</a> that represents a breakthrough in the two countries’
climate change negotiations. Most notably, the Asian superpower has
finally agreed to set concrete targets to reduce emissions across its
economy.
</p>
<p>
The statement asserts that the U.S. and China will work together and
with other parties at the upcoming United Nations climate summit in Abu
Dhabi, known as COP28, to “rise up to one of the greatest challenges of
our time for present and future generations of humankind.”
</p>
<p>
Underlying the summit is a stark reality: The world will not be able to
limit global warming to internationally agreed-upon levels if China, the
world’s largest producer of greenhouse gases, does not increase its
ambition. The country is now responsible for about a third of annual
global carbon emissions. China’s combustion of coal alone accounts for
25% of <em>all</em> energy-related emissions in the world.
</p>
<p style>
Yet China is also the world’s top generator of renewable energy and the
foremost manufacturer of much of the technology undergirding the
transition. Come with me on a tour of the complex, contradictory state
of China’s energy transition in eight eye-popping charts.

</iframe>
</div>
</center>
<p>
China’s climate pledges to date have been vague. The country has said
its carbon emissions will peak before 2030, for instance, but has not
set a firm target for when or at what level — and the target does not
apply to other planet-warming gases like methane. But according to an
analysis by Climate Action Tracker, under current policies, China’s
annual emissions will peak around 2025 and then plateau for the rest of
the decade. That’s primarily due to a projection that the country will
continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels as its total energy demand
grows. But as we’ll see, this is also one of the key uncertainties
around China’s transition.

</iframe>
</div>
</center>
<p>
The biggest source of emissions in China is the power sector. More than
60% of its electricity generation came from coal-fired power plants last
year. At COP26 in Glasgow, China said it would “phase down coal
consumption” beginning in 2026, but unlike the U.S., which hasn’t built
a large coal plant in 10 years, China is growing its coal fleet. Last
year, the country greenlit the construction of two new coal plants
<em>per week </em>on average,
<a href="https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/china-permits-two-new-coal-power-plants-per-week-in-2022/" target="_blank">according
to Global Energy Monitor</a>, and the trend

</iframe>
</div>
</center>
<p>
China’s coal permitting spree is the result of rising anxieties among
leadership over energy security in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, war
in Ukraine, and now the Israel-Hamas war,
<a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/kevin-tu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Kevin
Tu</a>, a non-resident fellow at Columbia’s Center on Global Energy
Policy, told me. He said China “undoubtedly” overemphasized security in
its energy decision-making and that these plants were at risk of
becoming stranded assets.
</p>
<p>
But as Cornell University professor and Heatmap contributor Jeremy
Wallace
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/what-chinas-economic-resurgence-means-for-the-planet" target="_self">wrote
earlier this year</a>, China’s coal plants haven’t even been running at
full capacity, and are “shifting to a role of backing-up renewables.”
The International Energy Agency
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">predicted
last month</a> that China will “gradually use its coal-fired power more
to provide flexibility and less to deliver bulk energy.”
</p>
<p>
China may also begin trying to capture the carbon emitted from its coal
plants, with the help of the U.S. One of the points of agreement reached
this week was an aim to “advance at least 5 large-scale cooperative
[carbon capture, utilization, and storage] projects each by 2030.”

</iframe>
</div>
</center>
<p>
Even though China is building coal plants like there’s no tomorrow, the
proportion of its overall energy consumption coming from fossil fuels is
actually dropping quite rapidly — at a much faster rate than in the U.S.
The country has reduced fossil fuels to about 82% of its energy mix, and
plans to get no more than 75% of its energy from fossil fuels by 2030.
</p>
<p>
The analysis by Climate Action Tracker shows China “significantly
overachieving” that goal, primarily because the country is building wind
and solar farms at a truly wild pace.

<p>
China will build more solar generation this year than the U.S. has
built, period. The country’s 2023 additions of low-carbon resources —
solar, wind, nuclear, and hydroelectric — are enough to
<a href="https://twitter.com/_HannahRitchie/status/1724054866501177821" target="_blank">meet
the annual electricity needs of the entire United Kingdom</a>.
</p>
<p>
Critics of China’s climate commitments look at the country’s
unbelievably fast progress on renewables and argue it could easily raise
its ambition. The country will most certainly exceed the 1,200 gigawatts
of wind and solar it has outlined in its current policy plans.
</p>
<p style>
China is even doing what has become impossible in much of the Western
world and growing its nuclear fleet. “This will be the largest expansion
of nuclear capacity in history, by far,” Jacopo Buongiorno, a professor
of nuclear science and engineering at MIT,
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/30/how-china-became-king-of-new-nuclear-power-how-us-could-catch-up.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told

China has already won the race when it comes to manufacturing clean
technologies. Even though the U.S. is pouring billions of dollars into
building up its own manufacturing capacity, it’s hard to imagine we’ll
ever put a real dent in China’s market dominance for lithium-ion battery
and solar module production.

It’s much more likely that the U.S. and other developed countries will
continue to rely heavily on China for their own energy transitions.
Earlier this year, Group of Seven leaders admitted as much when they
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/20/world/decoupling-china-de-risking.html" target="_blank">described
their approach</a> to relations with China as “derisking, not
decoupling.”
</p>
<p style>
China’s manufacturing prowess could also benefit a far wider swath of
the globe. “China has an opportunity to leverage such capabilities to
facilitate deploying clean energy globally,” said Gang He, an assistant
professor of energy and climate policy at Baruch College, in an email.
“Especially in the world’s least developed and most vulnerable
countries.”

<p>
That’s not happening yet. In September 2021, China committed to ending
its overseas financing of coal-fired power plants and to support
renewable energy development abroad. But while its coal finance came to
an abrupt halt, its investment in wind and solar has not gone up
accordingly,
<a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/greening-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to the World Resources Institute</a>.
</p>
<p>
But in the new joint statement with the U.S., China agreed to “pursue
efforts to triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2030” in
addition to accelerating the “substitution” of renewables for fossil
fuels in their own countries.
</p>
<p>
How to make sense of all of this?
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week,
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-chinas-emissions-set-to-fall-in-2024-after-record-growth-in-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>CarbonBrief</em></a>
had quite an optimistic take on the data. It found that China’s rate of
low-carbon energy expansion is on track to outpace the annual increase
in electricity demand — telling a different story than Climate Action
Tracker projected about that first key uncertainty I mentioned. This
could push emissions “into an extended period of structural decline,”
the authors wrote. But it all depends on whether wind and solar
interests can overcome China’s powerful coal lobby.
</p>
<p>
“What China really needs is to conduct some serious institutional reform
to make its power system more friendly toward renewables,” Tu told me.
“The problem in China is that the coal interest group makes such reform
very difficult.”

<p>date: 2023-11-15, updated: 2023-11-15, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
This is
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/11/hackers-can-steal-ssh-cryptographic-keys-in-new-cutting-edge-attack/">interesting</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For the first time, researchers have demonstrated that a large portion
of cryptographic keys used to protect data in computer-to-server SSH
traffic are vulnerable to complete compromise when naturally occurring
computational errors occur while the connection is being established.
</p>
<p>
[…]
</p>
<p>
The vulnerability occurs when there are errors during the signature
generation that takes place when a client and server are establishing a
connection. It affects only keys using the RSA cryptographic algorithm,
which the researchers found in roughly a third of the SSH signatures
they examined. That translates to roughly 1 billion signatures out of
the 3.2 billion signatures examined. Of the roughly 1 billion RSA
signatures, about one in a million exposed the private key of the host…

movements require solidarity</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: The Occidental News (Occidental College
Student Newspaper)</p>
<p>
Since the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the Tibetan people have been
fighting for independence from China. My grandfather left Tibet in 1959,
and his children eventually made their way to the US. Although I’m a
member of the Tibetan diaspora, I grew up far from any Tibetan
communities. So in 2019, when my friend suggested I join […]

<p>
There aren’t many artists who can make their fans cause
an earthquake, break Ticketmaster, receive an eight minute standing
ovation or become mayor for a day in Santa Clara. But Taylor Swift has
done it all. I never had a whole Spotify playlist dedicated to Swift’s

My favorite Disney movie as a kid was “Cinderella.” If I said that to
you face to face, you might be a little surprised. The person I’ve grown
into does not look like the kind of person who enjoyed a swooning
romance, a rags-to-riches tale, a story where the girl gets swept off

In an article titled “37 professors sign pro-Palestine email, face
pushback from colleagues,” The Occidental quoted Comparative Studies in
Literature and Culture (CSLC) professor Jacob Mackey as saying that it
is “factually inaccurate and extremely dangerous” to call Israel a
“settler colonial” society. We are unsure what this claim is based on or

Occidental athletes follow a rigorous schedule to perform their best.
Often, they push their bodies with training that challenges the
strongest of them. The antidote is rest and recovery. For some, it’s a

<p class style>
<em>The oil industry is not telling a credible story about its own
future. Far from doubling down on the future of oil — as they’d have us
believe — and as climate action advocates fear – the most powerful oil
producers are planning for obsolescence, but they’re hoping to do it on
their own, lucrative, terms.</em><em></em>
</p>
<p style>
<em>The end of more than a century of growth in oil use is almost here,
but it’s not straightforward.</em>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
One of the world’s leading forecasters of energy trends is now emphatic
that the amount of oil, gas, and coal used around the world each day
will begin to taper off within a few years. According to the
International Energy Agency, global oil consumption, currently just over
100 million barrels per day, will peak later this decade at around 102
milllion barrels per day even without any new climate policy measures.
We are at “the beginning of the end of the era of fossil fuels,” IEA
chief Fatih Birol
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f6155d7b-2ef7-4f62-a08a-b640b7e87fca" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>
in September.
</p>
<p>
None of this is adequate to stay within safe climate limits, but it’s
hard to overstate what it means for the oil industry, which has enjoyed
almost uninterrupted growth for its 150-odd-year existence.
</p>
<p>
Oil producers vigorously pushed back on the IEA’s outlook. OPEC+, the
oil producers’ cartel,
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/091423-opec-launches-latest-broadside-against-the-iea-over-peak-oil-prediction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">accused
</a>the agency of being “ideologically driven.” Chief executives of
Exxon and state-controlled Saudi Aramco
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/aramco-ceo-says-notion-peak-oil-demand-driven-by-policies-not-markets-2023-09-18/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">insisted
</a>that demand will continue to grow for decades to come.
</p>
<p>
But while the biggest and most successful oil producers rail against the
IEA’s forecast, hinting that the agency is some kind of woke climate
activist, their own actions tell a different story. Oil producers know
that their industry is on the cusp of an inexorable decline, and they
are preparing for it.
</p>
<p style>
That might seem counter-intuitive given the spate of merger and
acquisition news this fall. Last month Exxon made an
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$65 billion bid</a> for
Pioneer Natural Resources, which owns a swathe of Permian shale, and a
couple of weeks later Chevron offered $53 billion for Hess Corporation,
which includes a chunk of deepwater oil fields off Guyana. “Fossil fuels
aren’t going anywhere,” <u>declared <em>The New York Times
</em></u>after the Exxon-Pioneer announcement. Like many other stories,
the <em>Times’ </em>article pointed out that Exxon is choosing to invest
in more oil, but not renewable energy. Earlier this year Shell cut its
target for renewable energy growth. It looks like another vote in favor
of oil’s strong future.
</p>
<p>
But neither the oil industry’s protestations, nor the big U.S.
acquisitions, nor the lack of enthusiasm for green investments by oil
majors, tells us that oil’s rise will continue for decades. In fact some
of these developments point in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p>
Let’s start with the acquisitions. They’re certainly big; Exxon is
preparing to buy Pioneer for shares equivalent to a sixth of Exxon’s own
market capitalization; and Chevron’s Hess acquisition is of similarly
huge proportions. Big corporate takeovers, however, do not indicate a
growing industry. In boom years anyone can raise capital; when things
get tough it’s time for “consolidation” because only companies with
scale can survive.<em></em>
</p>
<p style>
To understand how these deals are conservative bets on the future of
oil, look at what in the commodities world is called the “production
cost curve” — a way of analyzing the financial logic of anything that’s
mined or pumped out of the ground.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image" style>
<img alt="Production cost curve." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="478407050950932210e39265be938b8f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="c55a4" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDQ4MDc3OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyODM4MzUxNn0.GJQMhNS3HJJwz5HnGUZB0bdwbaBsAox3AXfuRR2f7Eo/image.png?width=980"/>

</p>
<p style>
The curve shows total oil production capacity, ranked horizontally from
the cheapest to the most expensive to extract. (The colored dots
represent different International Energy Agency scenarios, with the
first more climate-aligned and the last being simply “business as
usual,” but they’re not particularly important for our purposes.)
</p>
<p style>
The oil industry consists of a panoply of producers, each owning assets
with different geological features, chemical compositions, and financial
flexibility that put them on different parts of the curve.
</p>
<p style>
Now, the greater the world’s total oil consumption, the more likely it
is that prices will be high enough that those at the highest end of the
production cost curve — everyone on the steep incline on the curve’s
right — can still make money.
</p>
<p style>
But while prices for oil are currently high, the acquisitions are not
counting on them remaining so.
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wood Mackenzie</a>
<a href="https://www.woodmac.com/news/opinion/what-does-the-chevron-hess-deal-mean-for-oil-and-gas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>
that Chevron’s Guyana fields would have “highly competitive breakeven
costs.” Another energy consultancy, Rystad, pointed out that
Exxon-Pioneer would
<a href="https://www.rigzone.com/news/analysts_look_at_what_exxonpioneer_deal_would_mean-09-oct-2023-174276-article/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have
the lowest breakeven</a> costs of any Permian producer; whereas
previously they’d only rank second and fourth, respectively. In other
words, Chevron and Exxon are rationally trying to position themselves on
the left-hand side of the curve — the safe demand zone — where they hope
to outlast competitors whose breakeven costs per barrel are too high to
survive a world weaning itself off oil.
</p>
<p>
So the beginning of the end of oil doesn’t mean game over for Exxon,
Chevron, or Saudi Aramco – <em>if</em> they play their cards right. Some
oil will be sold for the next couple of decades at least. The trajectory
down, however, is unprecedented, and it’s not clear that even the
canniest producers won’t get caught out by the speed of transition to
electric vehicles, for example.
</p>
<p>
But what about backing away from green energy? If fossil fuels’ heyday
is over, surely everyone should pile into the next big thing?
</p>
<p>
Not necessarily. Consider where their money comes from. Big oil
companies like Exxon and Chevron have plenty of cash, but they have to
keep shareholders happy. Those investors are in those companies for
various reasons; but one reason some of them actively choose it is for
its specific characteristics: long capital-intensive investment cycles
and high profits when things go well.
</p>
<p>
Green energy investments are different. The rates of return can be
lower, but risks are also lower, particularly over a longer time
horizon.
</p>
<p style>
In fact it’s a conventional tenet of investing that if companies see
their entire industry shrinking, they should <em>not</em> necessarily
pivot into a new sector that is replacing it. The principles of
“shareholder value,” for example,
<a href="https://hbr.org/2006/09/ten-ways-to-create-shareholder-value" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">holds</a>
that companies should return cash to shareholders if there are no
credible investment opportunities, so <em>they</em> can divert that
money into new sectors.
</p>
<p style>
That’s exactly what <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">those
massive share buyback programs are doing.</a> The world’s biggest oil
companies ramped up purchases of their own shares — which returns cash
to investors — to the value of more than $135 billion last year,
<a href="https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/press-releases/global-share-buybacks-surge-to-a-record-1-31-trillion-almost-equalling-dividends/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> investment manager Janus Henderson; <em>Bloomberg</em>
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-12-05/president-joe-biden-is-right-to-question-big-oil-s-stock-buybacks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a>
it was a more than 10-fold increase on the previous year and many U.S.
and European majors are extending or expanding their buybacks this year.
</p>
<center>
<div class="rm-embed embed-media">
<iframe aria-label="Stacked Columns" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="500" id="datawrapper-chart-PeOjs" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PeOjs/2/" style="border: none;" title="A Breakdown of the Oil Industry’s Cash Spending: " width="680">
</iframe>
</div>
</center>
<p style>
The buybacks, as much as they might be a repellent illustration of
windfall profits arising from wars, are being conducted <em>instead of
investing in more upstream investment</em>. Of course, this logic
doesn’t align with the much-repeated idea that “oil companies will have
to be involved in the transition,” but neither do the actions of oil
companies.
</p>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
Finally, it pays to question the messenger. It would not be in oil
companies’ interests to say out loud that demand is peaking soon, even
if they and their investors all know it.
</p>
<p style>
Imagine if Exxon or OPEC+’s secretariat said “yes, oil demand is
probably close to peaking; it might plateau for awhile but the era of
growth is over.” Money would flow out of the sector. Smaller, more
expensive producers would stop investing in finding and producing more
oil, which would lead to more volatile price spikes, driving the world
to switch to clean energy even faster (JP Morgan says the recent high
prices has already provoked
“<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-04/saudis-to-stick-with-1-million-barrel-oil-supply-cut-to-year-end" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demand
destruction</a>” — in part explaining why prices haven’t spiked as much
as recent world events might suggest.) Governments and other companies
might even step up efforts to cut their dependency on oil. It would
become a self-fulfilling prophecy with challenging implications for
countries and companies whose existence is based on pumping oil and gas.
</p>
<p style>
OPEC is typically optimistic about oil demand in its own publications.
It
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/1091.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">predicted</a>
back in 2006 that oil demand in 2025 would be 113 million barrels per
day — a number that’s 10 million above what has ever been reached. (It’s
now forecasting that oil demand will reach a similar level — 116
million/day — only 20 years later, in 2045.) But OPEC, and particularly
its most powerful member Saudi Arabia, has long been quietly anxious
about demand destruction. With the IEA saying recent prices suggest that
is already happening now, thanks to the rise of electric vehicles, OPEC
has further reason to keep their fretting private.
</p>
<p style>
Oil producers are — again, rationally — planning to extract the last bit
of profits from a declining sector, while hoping that energy users
everywhere remain dependent upon a volatile, expensive, and polluting –
but very profitable – energy source. If newer sovereign producers try to
get into the game late (such as Barbados, Senegal, and Mozambique) they
might well get caught out by the shrinking oil market. That would leave
the cheaper and better-capitalized producers — Gulf countries, or the
U.S. majors — to continue selling at a comfortable profit, albeit
slightly lower than they’d receive in the pre-peak era.
</p>
<p style>
The oil majors are settling in for a long, comfortable decline.

Alpine is lightweight because almost nothing is pre-configured for you
and you must DIY… <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">but</em> saying
that its origins are as a router distro repurposed to be
general-purpose. It uses a different libc, which is a huge change. Every
single app has to be recompiled to work with musl libc instead of glibc.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Open_WRT is lightweight because it’s dedicated to running on routers.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
CBL Mariner is lightweight because it’s only for certain niche server
VMs.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
antiX is lightweight because it’s a general-purpose graphical desktop
but ruthlessly purged of heavyweight components, all replaced with the
smallest lightest-weight alternatives.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Raspberry Pi Desktop is lightweight because it’s an x86 version of a
brutally pared-down Debian originally meant for a single-core Arm
computer with 512MB of RAM.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Bodhi Linux is lightweight because it’s Ubuntu but with all the desktop
stuff removed, replaced with a forked old version of a very lightweight
window manager and almost nothing else. Any functionality you want you
must install.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Lots of different answers, lots of different use cases, lots of
different strategies.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
This is not a "yes/no" question. It’s complex and nuanced.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Debian is not lightweight. Its strapline is "the universal operating
system". It’s a Swiss Army knife that can do anything and that’s part of
its definition.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
You can make a lightweight install of it if you know what you’re doing
but ticking the box for a lightweight desktop and installing is not
doing that.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Comparison: you see a lightweight sports motorcycle. It’s green. You buy
a Harley and paint it green and say "look mine is a lightweight sports
bike now!"
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Devuan is just Debian with systemd removed and openrc or sysvinit in its
place. This is not a big sweeping change. It’s equivalent to looking at
the sports bike, seeing it has Bridgestone tyres instead of Dunlop, and
swapping the tyres on the Harley to Bridgestone tyres.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
It is a trivial change compared to a libc change. It’s routine
maintenance to change your tyres. You need to do it regularly anyway. It
doesn’t need the bike to be rebuilt.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
It’s not <em class="_7s4syPYtk5hfUIjySXcRE">easy</em>. It takes hours
and skills and tools and so on but it’s not sweeping.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Devuan has rebuilt a tonne of packages to remove dependencies on systemd
and that’s not trivial but it’s still Debian. By and large you can
download any Debian package and install it and it’ll just work because
most things never interact with the init daemon and it won’t make a big
difference.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
A Swiss Army knife with a different axle that pivots a bit more smoothly
and with less force is still a Swiss Army knife and only a knife expert
will be able to even tell the difference.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
It doesn’t make it into a super-slim lightweight knife, like – I know
nothing about knives – something
<a href="https://wildstags.co.uk/products/blaser-lightweight-knife" class="_3t5uN8xUmg0TOwRCOGQEcU" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank">like
this</a>.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
You could disassemble a Victorinox and rebuild it into something like
that but it’s really hard and an amateur will end up with a broken pile
of bits.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
So the fact that people build lightweight distros out of Debian doesn’t
mean Debian is lightweight or that you can do it yourself. Think about
it: if it was easy, lightweight remixes wouldn’t exist! There’d be no
point.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
How do you tell if it’s lightweight or not?
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Look at how big the ISO file you download is.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
4-5GB is big.

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
2-3GB is typical.

&lt;2GB is small.

~1GB is tiny.

<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Run <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">df -h</code> and look at how
much disk space it takes. Much the same applies.
</p>
<p class="_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM">
Run <code class="_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM">free -h</code> on a

200MB is light in 2023.

Under 0.5GB is good.

</p>
<p>
For example, I like to say that when I die my gravestone should say
<i>He’s Done Digging</i> or something like that, to stand in contrast to
my long-lived motto –
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/07/03/150022.html">Still diggin!</a>
I did some writing this morning about
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+Future-Safe+Archives">Future-Safe
Archives</a>, and thought to get that as a picture. The piece isn’t
ready to publish yet, but no reason not to share the illustration. So
here it is..

Uncle Davy, no longer diggin.
</div>
</p>
<p>
PS: No need for an actual gravestone. Online is fine. Hopefully we’ll
figure out how to make such things persist before it’s needed. <span

id="til-that-some-people-cant-remember-the-difference-between-the-386-486">TIL
that some people can’t remember the difference between the 386 &amp;
486</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: Liam on Linux</p>
I suppose it was a long time
ago.<br /><br />So…<br /><br /><span class="commtext c00">
<p>
The 80386DX was the first x86 CPU to be 32-bit and have an on-chip MMU.
And nothing else: no cache, no FPU.
</p>
<p>
The FPU was a discrete part, the 80387DX.
</p>
<p>
Because OS/2 1.x didn’t support the 80386, and so couldn’t run DOS apps
well, and so flopped, the 16-bit 80286 kept selling well. It ran DOS
fast and it could run Windows 2/286 and Windows 3 in Standard Mode which
was good enough. It could only address 16MB of RAM but that was
fantastically expensive <i>and</i> it was more than enough for DOS and
Windows 3.
</p>
<p>
So, because DOS still ruled, Intel made a cost-reduced version of the
80386DX, the 80386SX. This had a 16-bit data bus, so it could use
cheaper 16-bit motherboards and 16-bit wide RAM, still limited to a max
of 16MB. Still enough.
</p>
<p>
That needed a maths copro for hardware floating point, too: a different
part, the 80387SX.
</p>
<p>
Then Windows 3 came along, which was also good enough, and started a
move in PC apps to GUIs. Windows 3.1 (1992) was better still.
</p>
<p>
So Intel had a 2nd go at the 32-bit chip market with the 80486, marketed
as the "486". This integrated a better 386DX-compatible CPU core with a
few extra instructions, complete with MMU, <i>plus</i> a 387-style FPU,
plus a small amount of L1 cache, all onto one die.
</p>
<p>
But it was expensive, and didn’t sell well.
</p>
<p>
Also, all the 3rd party x86 makers leapt on the bandwagon and integrated
the extra instructions into 16-bit bus 386SX compatible chips and
branded them as 486s: the Cyrix and IBM "486slc" for instance. This ate
into sales of the real 486.
</p>
<p>
So Intel came up with an ethically very dodgy borderline scam: it
shipped 486s with the FPU disabled, calling them the "486DX" to reuse
the branding that distinguished the 32-bit-bus models of 386 from the
16-bit-bus.
</p>
<p>
People don’t understand stuff like bus widths or part numbers, as your
post demonstrates, and I mean no offense. They don’t.
</p>
<p>
So now there was a new model of 486, the 486SX with a disabled FPU, and
the 486DX with it still turned on.
</p>
<p>
The "SX" model needed a new motherboard with a 2nd CPU socket that
accepted a "floating point co-processor", called the "487", which was
nothing of the kind. The "SX" was a lie and so was the "487 copro". The
487 was a 2nd complete 486 chip that disabled the original and took
over.
</p>
<p>
But it reused the older branding, which is what you’ve remembered.
</p>
<p>
Later, briefly, Intel made a cheaper cost-reduced 486SX with a smaller
die with no FPU present, but not many of them. The clock-doubled 486DX2
took over quite quickly and killed the 486DX <i>and</i> 486SX market.
</p>
<p>
Some commentators speculated that the 486DX vs 486SX marketing thing
allowed Intel to sell defective 486s in which the FPU didn’t work but if
it did that was a tiny tiny number: a rounding error.

Urge Biden to Bring Up Issue of Detained Americans With Xi</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers are urging President Joe Biden to prioritize the
release of U.S. citizens deemed wrongfully detained by China when he
meets Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The U.S. State Department says Texas businessman Mark Swidan, Chinese
American businessman Kai Li from Long Island, New York, and California
pastor David Lin are wrongfully detained by China.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, has repeatedly spoken out for Mark Swidan.
McCaul urged Biden to put the release of Americans wrongfully detained
by China high on the agenda for his meeting with Xi.</p>
<p>McCaul said in a statement sent to VOA Mandarin, “The Biden
administration must stop making any concessions based on false promises
and hold the [Chinese Communist Party] accountable for its gross human
rights violations.”</p>
<p>In a letter to the White House on Nov. 8, Republican Representative
Mike Gallagher, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese
Communist Party, along with 12 Republican members of the committee,
asked that Biden raise 10 issues with Xi, one of which is to release all
American citizens the U.S. government has determined to be wrongfully
detained in China.</p>
<p>Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, also wrote to Biden, according to Reuters. </p>
<p>“With the holiday season approaching, and the opportunity to start
the New Year on a more positive note in bilateral U.S.-China
relationships, I implore you to secure commitments from President Xi to
release these Americans immediately,” Cardin wrote.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, a State Department spokesperson has noted that
it continually raises wrongfully detained U.S. nationals during
engagements with senior Chinese officials.</p>
<p>China says such cases are handled according to law.</p>
<p>Swidan, a Texas businessman, was arrested on drug-related charges in
Guangdong Province in 2012 on his first trip to China.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Jiangmen Intermediate People’s Court in southern
Guangdong convicted him of manufacturing and trafficking drugs.</p>
<p>In 2019, it handed down a death sentence with a two-year suspension.
Under Chinese law, this means the sentence can be commuted to life
imprisonment after two years, depending on the convict’s behavior.</p>
<p>This year, his appeal was denied, and the original sentence was
upheld. </p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in China said in a statement, “We are disappointed
by this decision and will continue to press for his immediate release
and return to the United States.”</p>
<p>The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention of the United Nations Human
Rights Council also characterized Swidan’s detention as illegal and
called on Chinese authorities to immediately release him and provide
compensation.</p>
<p>“It is 11 years this month since Mark was detained,” Swidan’s mother,
Katherine Flint Swidan, 73, told VOA Mandarin. She said Biden must bring
up those wrongfully detained in China when he meets Xi because “they are
pawns.”</p>
<p>She told VOA Mandarin that the Chinese government has denied
visitation requests from the U.S. consulate since September, and Beijing
was transferring her son to Dongguan Prison, near the border with Hong
Kong. </p>
<p>She last heard her son’s voice during a call in 2018 and since then
has communicated by letter.</p>
<p>In one, Swidan described dislocated knees, fluid accumulation in his
legs and constant bleeding in his mouth.</p>
<p>She said Nicholas Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China, told her in
August after visiting Swidan that he was in poor health and had suicidal
tendencies.</p>
<p>Katherine Swidan lives in a small apartment in Luling, Texas, about
76 kilometers south of Austin. She needs a walker and relies on Social
Security benefits to make ends meet.</p>
<p>She worries she may never see her son again and that he may never
leave China safely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Katherine Swidan said she spoke to Burns over the weekend, according
to Reuters. She described the conversation as “disappointing” because
the ambassador would not say whether Biden would raise her son’s name
with Xi.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in China has not provided updated information to
VOA’s inquiries.</p>
<p>Kai Li’s son, Harrison Li, sent a letter to Biden last week, saying,
“I’m following up now on my letters to you dated April 8, 2022, and June
15, 2022, to urge you to earn my father’s release in advance of your
anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco
later this month.”</p>
<p>Harrison Li told VOA Mandarin, “The detainee issue is the type of
small but important thorn in the bilateral relationship that can and
should actually be resolved through dialogue. Our government has an
obligation to take advantage of the current apparent warming in
U.S.-China relations to move progress forward on these longstanding
detainee cases.”</p>
<p>Chinese authorities arrested Kai Li at the Shanghai airport in 2016.
Two years later, he was convicted of espionage charges, which he denies,
and sentenced to 10 years in Shanghai’s Qingpu Prison, where many
foreigners are incarcerated.</p>
<p>A former fellow prisoner, released from the institution housing Kai
Li, told VOA Mandarin in September that Kai Li was sometimes called on
by prison staff to help them communicate with foreign prisoners who
spoke English.</p>
<p>The former prisoner asked not to be identified because he is afraid
of retaliation by Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>He said Kai Li translated when prisoners were taken to the hospital
and also managed the prison library. He added that Kai Li also often
spoke of his son Harrison and was proud of Harrison for constantly
speaking up about his case.</p>
<p>David Lin, a pastor from Orange County, California, was arrested in
2006, then convicted and sentenced to life on what the U.S. government
says were bogus charges of contract fraud. A year ago, before the
Biden-Xi meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia,
Chinese authorities reduced Lin’s sentence to 24 years, meaning he will
be 75 when freed in 2030.   </p>
<p>According to ChinaAid, Lin was detained in 2006 for helping a house
church to build a church building, something that is illegal in
China.</p>
<p>“Subsequently, authorities restricted him from leaving the country.
He was arrested in 2009 on suspicion of ‘contract fraud.’”</p>
<p>Lin was sentenced to life in prison on the charge later that
year.</p>
<p>Peter Humphrey, a British journalist turned consultant, was detained
with his wife in 2013. They were found guilty of illegally obtaining
information on Chinese citizens. Humphrey was sentenced to two and a
half years in prison.</p>
<p>His wife was sentenced to two years. Both were released early in June
2015 for health reasons.</p>
<p>He now helps foreigners imprisoned by the Chinese government and
campaigns for their release.</p>
<p>He believes there are more than three Americans wrongfully
incarcerated by China.</p>
<p>Humphrey told VOA Mandarin, “The ordeals of the many Americans held
in Xi’s jails should be high on the agenda for Biden’s meeting with Xi
if Biden cares at all about wrongfully incarcerated American citizens.
That means all American prisoners and not just a tiny select
handful.”</p>
<p>“Not a single one of them has had a fair and transparent trial in
front of an impartial judge because the Chinese legal and judicial
system does not provide any such thing,” he said.</p>
<p>He suggested Biden hand over a list of all American citizens
incarcerated in China, demand a mass prison transfer swap agreement to
bring them home to an American facility, and then review their cases,
none of which “would survive the scrutiny of an American court.”</p>

March in Washington to Demand Work Permits for Migrants</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hundreds of people gathered Tuesday in Washington to urge the Biden
administration to extend labor protections to undocumented immigrants in
the United States.</p>
<p>The Here to Work Day of Action march, organized by a coalition of
dozens of migrant advocacy groups, called on U.S. President Joe Biden to
allow immigrants living in the U.S. for years to apply for work
permits. </p>
<p>Lydia Walther-Rodríguez, one of the march organizers, told VOA that
more than 3,000 people attended the event. They visited members of
Congress to ask them for support and to press Biden to give work permits
to the estimated 11 million people who are here undocumented. </p>
<p>Walther-Rodríguez, who is a member of CASA, an immigration advocacy
group, said allowing people to work and giving them temporary protection
would also prevent family separation. </p>
<p>“We are talking about security, but a security that gives the migrant
movement the peace of mind to continue on a path to citizenship,” she
said. </p>
<p>Since February 2023, the Here to Work Coalition has brought together
more than 300 businesses, Republican and Democratic governors, and
members of Congress to urge the Biden administration to expand work
permits for immigrants who have been paying taxes in the U.S. for
years. </p>
<p>According to immigrant advocates, the president can take this action
by expanding humanitarian parole, Temporary Protected Status, and
Deferred Enforced Departure. All three policies allow individuals who
meet specific requirements to stay in the country and work temporarily.
 </p>
<p>U.S. Congressman Jesus “Chuy” García, a Democrat from Illinois,
addressed the protesters and supported their appeals, saying Biden must
deliver for immigrants and that “We must all be heard.”</p>
<p>In a written statement after the march, Garcia added: “Whether you
arrived days ago or decades ago, immigrants deserve dignity. Many of my
constituents have worked and paid taxes for years, but still live
without the protection and stability that comes from a work
permit.” </p>
<p>US labor shortage</p>
<p>In an October report, Stephanie Ferguson, director of Global
Employment Policy and Special Initiatives at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, wrote that the country is facing “unprecedented challenges”
trying to find enough workers to fill open jobs. </p>
<p>“Right now, the latest data shows that we have 9.6 million job
openings in the U.S., but only 6.4 million unemployed workers. We have a
lot of jobs, but not enough workers to fill them. If every unemployed
person in the country found a job, we would still have around 3 million
open jobs,” Ferguson wrote.</p>
<p>According to data from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, there are 68
workers for every 100 open jobs.</p>
<p>Decades in the U.S.</p>
<p>Catalina Bueno, a Mexican immigrant who has lived in the United
States for more than 30 years, traveled from Chicago to Washington. She
hopes a work permit and Temporary Protected Status could help her
immigration status.  </p>
<p>“We’ve made our lives here, and I think it is fair that they take us
into account, which is fair to us because we have a life here … My whole
life is here and returning to Mexico is difficult for me … We must all
be heard, and the president, more than anything, must be fair to
everyone,” she said.</p>
<p>Temporary protection </p>
<p>The Biden administration recently announced an extension and
redesignation of the program that gives temporary protection from
deportation for nationals of Sudan and Ukraine. Nationals of El
Salvador, Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua also have had their protection
extended. </p>
<p>Advocates also called for new TPS designations. Immigrant rights
groups have ongoing campaigns for Mauritania and Democratic Republic of
Congo.</p>
<p>TPS allows migrants whose home countries are considered unsafe to
live and work in the United States for a period of time if they meet
certain requirements established by the U.S. government.  </p>
<p>Other forms of relief include deferred action, deferred enforced
departure, or parole. Each has distinguished requirements while offering
temporary relief from deportation and work authorization.</p>
<p>Some Republican lawmakers have pushed for legislation that would make
U.S. immigration law more restrictive. </p>
<p>Senate Republicans released a proposal on Nov. 6 that could prohibit
or limit Biden officials’ use of temporary protection for migrants
coming to the U.S.-Mexico border and those already in the United
States.</p>
<p>The one-page plan narrows the scope of the parole statute to clarify
that it is to be used rarely and limits granting parole to one year,
with up to one one-year extension or less. </p>
<p>Renata Castro, an immigration lawyer based in Florida, told VOA that
Congress needs to act and that immigration is about economic growth.</p>
<p>“We need an innovative economy and the only way we will be able to do
that is if we have meaningful immigration reform that deals with the
needs and the problems of the United States of today, not of 30 or 40
years ago,” Castro said. </p>
<p>The immigration attorney said other countries are taking note of the
immigration challenges in the United States, and they are working hard
to attract the best and the brightest.</p>
<p>“I, as a practicing immigration attorney, think that United States
employers, particularly small businesses in the service industries,
construction and hospitality, are really struggling because they cannot
find individuals who are ready, willing and available to work. …
Meaningful immigration reform could solve all of that,” she added.</p>
<p>Humanitarian parole or temporary status or protection, such as TPS or
DED, is not a pathway to permanent residency.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>With this release, .NET reshapes the way we build intelligent,
cloud-native applications and high-traffic services that scale on
demand. Whether you’re deploying to Linux or Windows, using containers
or a cloud app model of your choice, .NET 8 makes building these apps
easier. It includes a set of proven libraries that are used today by the
many high-scale services at Microsoft to help you with fundamental
challenges around observability, resiliency, scalability, manageability,
and more. Integrate large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT
directly into your .NET app. Use a single powerful component model to
handle all your web UI needs with Blazor. Deploy your mobile
applications to the latest version of iOS and Android with .NET MAUI.
Discover new language enhancements that make your code more concise and
expressive with C# 12. It’s still wild to me to that Microsoft provides
detailed installation instructions for .NET for a variety of Linux
distributions, down to stuff like Alpine.</p>

id="google-play-tightens-up-rules-for-android-app-developers-to-require-testing-increased-app-review">Google
Play tightens up rules for Android app developers to require testing,
increased app review</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Google today is announcing strengthened protections for Android
developers publishing apps to its Google Play store. The changes are a
part of Google’s broader efforts at keeping low-quality and unsafe apps
out of its app store and off consumers’ devices, which also recently
included the launch of a new real-time app scanning feature to combat
malicious apps. Today, the company says it will now require new Android
developers with personal accounts to test their app with a minimum of 20
people for at least 2 weeks prior to publication. It additionally plans
to increase its investment in the app review processes, warning of
potential slowdowns in approvals for a small number of apps as these
changes roll out. At first glance, this sounds like a good idea – more
testing leads to better applications, is the reasoning – but it’s going
to be a massive burden for many small indie developers to even find 20
testers. In my experience, it’s usually the small indie teams or
individual developers that make the best applications on Android, while
the large, well-known brands release steady streams of garbage. In other
words, this is going to disproportionately affect the wrong people.</p>

id="tens-of-thousands-rally-in-washington-to-show-support-for-israel">Tens
of Thousands Rally in Washington to Show Support for Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered Tuesday on the National
Mall in Washington in a show of solidarity as Jews across the United
States and the world face a resurgence of antisemitism that activists at
the protest compared with the hatred that culminated in the
Holocaust.</p>
<p>The rally, called Americans March for Israel, was organized by
various Jewish organizations and featured speeches by politicians,
intellectuals, musicians and relatives of hostages abducted by
Hamas.</p>
<p>Signs reading, “Free the hostages” and “Never again is now” bobbed up
and down in the audience as speakers, including Israeli President Isaac
Herzog and U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, took their
turns.</p>
<p>“We will continue fighting for the release of all hostages until they
return to safety,” Schumer said, affirming U.S. support for Israel.</p>
<p>Herzog delivered his address from Israel.</p>
<p>“Jews came out of Auschwitz and vowed, ‘Never again,’” he said in
remarks shown on large TV screens. “As the blue and white flag was
hoisted over our ancient homeland, we vowed, ‘Never again.’”</p>
<p>Herzog went on to describe Hamas’ terror attack last month, which
left 1,200 Israelis dead, and asked the crowd to “cry out together,
‘Never again!’”</p>
<p>Representative Mike Johnson, the newly appointed speaker of the U.S.
House, also spoke to the crowd.</p>
<p>“There are few issues in Washington that could so easily bring
together leaders of both parties and both chambers,” he said. “But the
survival of the state of Israel and her people unites us together — and
it unites all Americans.”</p>
<p>The march comes just over a week after pro-Palestinian demonstrators
held a similarly large gathering on the National Mall, and two days
after 180,000 people took to the streets in France to rally against
antisemitism.</p>
<p>Sam Markstein, 30, of Washington participated in Tuesday’s march. He
serves as the political director of the Republican Jewish Coalition,
which co-sponsored last week’s Republican presidential debate in
Miami.</p>
<p>“The message is, the Republican Party and Jews from across the
country stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Israel, and we’re going to keep
doing that until Hamas is defeated and obliterated,” Markstein told
VOA.</p>
<p>Avi Light, 21, of Rockland Community College in Suffern, New York,
said he hopes for a future beyond the bloodshed.</p>
<p>“I just want peace,” Light said, walking hastily alongside the Mall
with his Jewish classmates. “I just want people to stop dying. I really
want the whole war to just end.”</p>
<p>“I have friends in the [Israel Defense Forces] that I went to school
with,” Light continued. “I just want to be able to go to sleep at night
and know they’re safe.”</p>
<p>A few dozen anti-Zionist, ultra-Orthodox Jews led by Rabbi Dovid
Feldman, 52, of Monsey, New York, stood behind banners outside the
protest — including one with a red slash over the Israeli flag — drawing
scorn from several Jewish passersby.</p>
<p>Feldman and others chanted, “Judaism, yes! Zionism, no!” One
pro-Israel demonstrator came within inches of the counterprotesters,
screaming profanities.</p>
<p>Dorit Voda, a British Israeli living in Rockville, Maryland, also
confronted Feldman. Voda said she found Feldman’s statements to be
deeply offensive, saying that Israel was established “legally and
rightfully” in the aftermath of the Holocaust in large part to protect
survivors.</p>
<p>After several heated exchanges, U.S. Park Police spread out in a line
to shield Feldman’s group.</p>
<p>Feldman told VOA that the March for Israel “does not represent the
Jewish people” and blamed Hamas’ brutal October 7 assault entirely on
Israel, a claim that most prominent Jewish groups denounce as
antisemitic.</p>
<p>Feldman expressed outrage at the massive loss of life in the Gaza
Strip, where more than 11,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli
military operations since fighting broke out last month, according to
the Hamas-run Gaza health authority.</p>
<p>Feldman repeatedly clarified that he does not condone violence
against civilians.</p>
<p>Parked in his van outside VOA headquarters, which is just meters from
where the protest took place, Rabbi Yehuda Pevzner, 30, of Brooklyn, New
York, struck a less provocative tone.</p>
<p>Pevzner was part of a group of Hasidic Jews who drove what they call
a “synagogue on wheels” to Washington to help Jews carry out mitzvot, or
good deeds, such as doing tefillin, an ancient Jewish prayer ritual.</p>
<p>Pevzner said that Jews have an obligation “to help people in danger,”
both in Israel and beyond. He also said, citing the Torah, that Israel
is the Jewish homeland, and that Jews must look after one another,
particularly in light of recent incidents of antisemitism across the
globe.</p>
