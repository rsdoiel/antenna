vs. Oppression of Big Tech</h2>
<p>date: 2024-11-06, from: Purism News and Events</p>
<p>
The modern smartphone landscape is dominated by a handful of technology
giants, whose influence extends far beyond their own ecosystems. Unlike
in the heyday of the PC revolution where multiple companies fought tooth
and nail for market share by differentiating on feature functionality as
well as price – offering a plethora of alternatives – today’s smartphone
landscape is dominated by two main players: Apple’s IOS and Google’s
Android.
