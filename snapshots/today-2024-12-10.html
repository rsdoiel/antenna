Molecular Electronic Computer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: Advent of Computing</p>
<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">
In 1961 Texas Instruments unveiled the Molecular Electronic Computer,
aka: Mol-E-Com. It was a machine that fit in the palm of your hand, but
had all the power of a much larger computer. This was in an age of hefty
machines, which made the achievement all the more marvelous. How was
this even possible? It was all thanks to the wonders of molecular
electronics, and a boat load of funding from the US Air Force.

<h2 id="lightstorm-minimalistic-ruby-compiler">Lightstorm: minimalistic
Ruby compiler</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-09, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
Some time ago I was talking about an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfMX-dFMSr0">ahead-of-time Ruby
compiler</a>.We started the project with certain goals and hypotheses in
mind, and while the original compiler is at nearly 90% completion, there
are still those other 90% that needs to be done.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, we decided to strip it down to a bare minimum and
implement just enough features to validate the hypotheses.
</p>
<p>
Just like the original compiler we use MLIR to bridge the gap between
Ruby VM’s bytecode and the codegen, but instead of targeting LLVM IR
directly, we go through EmitC dialect and targeting C language, as it
significantly simplifies OS/CPU support. We go into a bit more details
later.
</p>
<p>
The source code of our minimalistic Ruby compiler is here:
<a href="https://github.com/dragonruby/lightstorm">https://github.com/dragonruby/lightstorm</a>.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the article covers why we decided to build it, how we
approached the problem, and what we discovered along the way.
</p>
<h2 id="motivation-and-the-use-case">
Motivation and the use case
</h2>
<p>
Our use case is pretty straightforward: we are building
<a href="https://dragonruby.org">a cross-platform game engine that’s
indie-focused, productive, and easy to use</a>. The game engine itself
is written in a mix of C and Ruby, but the main user-interface is the
Ruby itself.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the game development is done and the game is ready for
“deployment,” the code is more or less static and so we asked ourselves
if we can pre-compile it into machine code to make it run faster.
</p>
<p>
But given all the dynamism of Ruby, why would a compilation make it
faster?
</p>
<p>
So here comes our hypothesis. But first let’s look at some high-level
implementation details to see where the hypothesis comes from.
</p>
<h2 id="compilers-vs-interpreters">
Compilers vs Interpreters
</h2>
<p>
While a language itself cannot be strictly qualified as compiled or
interpreted, the typical implementations certainly are.
</p>
<p>
In case of a “compiled” language the compiler would take the whole
program, analyze it and produce the machine code targeting a specific
hardware (real or virtual), while an interpreter would take the program
and execute it right away, one “instruction” at a time.
</p>
<p>
<em>The definition above is a bit handwavy: zoom our far enough and
everything is a compiler, zoom in close enough and everything is an
interpreter. But you’ve got the gist.</em>
</p>
<p>
Most Ruby implementations are interpreter-based, and in our case we are
using <a href="https://mruby.org">mruby</a>.
</p>
<p>
The mruby interpreter is a lightweight register-based virtual machine
(VM).
</p>
<p>
Let’s look at a concrete example. The following piece of code:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span> <span style="color:#f92672">+</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span></span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
is converted into the following VM bytecode, consisting of various
operations (ops for short):
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-asm" data-lang="asm"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">LOADI</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">R1</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">LOADI</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">R2</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">ADD</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">R1</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">R2</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#a6e22e">HALT</span></span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
The VM’s interpreter loop looks as follows (pseudocode):
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="display:flex;"><span>dispatch_next:</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> Op op <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> bytecode.<span style="color:#a6e22e">next_op</span>();</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">switch</span> (op.opcode) {</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span> LOADI: {</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">store</span>(op.dest, <span style="color:#a6e22e">mrb_int</span>(op.literal));</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">goto</span> dispatch_next;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> }</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span> ADD: {</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> mrb_value lhs <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">load</span>(op.lhs);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> mrb_value rhs <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">load</span>(op.rhs);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">store</span>(op.dest, <span style="color:#a6e22e">mrb_add</span>(lhs, rhs));</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">goto</span> dispatch_next;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> }</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// More ops...</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">case</span> HALT: <span style="color:#66d9ef">goto</span> halt_vm;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> }</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>halt_vm:</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// ...</span></span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
For each bytecode operation the VM will jump/branch into the right
opcode handler, and then will branch back to the beginning of the
dispatch loop.In the meantime, each opcode handler would use a virtual
stack (confusingly located on the heap) to store intermediate results.
</p>
<p>
If we unroll the above bytecode manually, then the code can look like
this:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">goto</span> loadi_1;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>loadi_1:</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// LOADI R1 42</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span> mrb_value t1 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">mrb_int</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span>);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">store</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>, t1);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">goto</span> loadi_2;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>loadi_2:</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// LOADI R2 42</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span> mrb_value t2 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">mrb_int</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">store</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>, t2);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">goto</span> add;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>add:</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// ADD R1 R2</span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#75715e"></span> mrb_value lhs <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">load</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> mrb_value rhs <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">load</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> mrb_value t3 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">mrb_add</span>(lhs, rhs);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">store</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>, t3);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">goto</span> halt;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>halt:</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// shutdown VM</span></span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
Many items in this example can be eliminated: specifically, we can avoid
load/stores from/to the heap, and we can safely eliminate
<code>goto</code>s/branches:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="display:flex;"><span> mrb_value t1 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">mrb_int</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">42</span>);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> mrb_value t2 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">mrb_int</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">15</span>);;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> mrb_value t3 <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">mrb_add</span>(t1, t2);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> vstack.<span style="color:#a6e22e">store</span>(<span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>, t3);</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">goto</span> halt;</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span></span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>halt:</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span> <span style="color:#75715e">// shutdown VM</span></span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
So here goes our hypothesis:
</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="hypothesis">
Hypothesis
</h3>
<p>
By precompiling/unrolling the VM dispatch loop we can eliminate many
load/stores and branches along with branch mispredictions, this should
improve the performance of the end program.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We can also try to apply some optimizations based on the high-level
bytecode analysis, but due to the Ruby’s dynamism the static
optimization surface is limited.
</p>
<h2 id="approach">
Approach
</h2>
<p>
As mentioned in the beginning, building a full-fledged AOT compiler is a
laborious task which requires time and has certain constraints.
</p>
<p>
For the minimalistic version we decided to change/relax some of the
constraints as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the compiled code must be compatible with the existing ecosystem/runtime
</li>
<li>
the existing runtime must not require any changes
</li>
<li>
the supported language features should be easily “representable” in C
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Unlike the original compiler, we are not targeting machine code
directly, but C instead.This eliminates a lot of complexity, but it also
means that we only support a subset of the language (e.g., blocks and
exceptions are missing at the moment).
</p>
<p>
This is obviously not ideal, but it serves important purpose -
<strong>our goal at this point is to validate the hypothesis</strong>.
</p>
<p>
A classical compilation pipeline looks as follows:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/ruby-compiler/compilation-pipeline.png" alt="Classical compilation pipeline">
</p>
<p>
To build a compiler one needs to implement the conversions from the raw
source file all the way down to machine code and the language runtime
library.Since we are targeting the existing implementation, we have the
benefit of reusing the frontend (parsing + AST) and the runtime library.
</p>
<p>
Still, we need to implement the conversion from AST to the machine
code.And this is where the power of MLIR kicks in: we built a custom
dialect
(<a href="https://github.com/DragonRuby/lightstorm/blob/3ed0077af589ba51b98954bba8869daf58e22b9e/include/lightstorm/dialect/rite.td">Rite</a>)
which represents mruby VM’s bytecode, and then use a number of builtin
dialects (<code>cf</code>, <code>func</code>, <code>arith</code>,
<code>emitc</code>) to convert our IR into C code.
</p>
<p>
At this point, we can just use clang to compile/link the code together
with the existing runtime and that’s it.
</p>
<p>
The final compilation pipeline looks as follows:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/ruby-compiler/lightstorm-compilation-pipeline.png" alt="Lightstorm compilation pipeline">
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
With the benefit of MLIR we are able to build a funtional compiler in
just a couple of thousands lines of code!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now let’s look at how it performs.
</p>
<h2 id="some-numbers">
Some numbers
</h2>
<p>
Benchmarking is hard, so take these numbers with a grain of salt.
</p>
<p>
We run various (micro)-benchmarks showing results in the range of 1% to
1200% speedups, but we are sticking to the
<a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/aobench">aobench</a> as
it is very close to the game-dev workloads we are targeting.
</p>
<p>
mruby also uses
<a href="https://github.com/mruby/mruby/blob/e05dbf7bbc6d2fbecfd7d4a46418fbe4421bc160/benchmark/bm_ao_render.rb">aobench</a>
as part of its benchmark suite, though we slightly modified it to
replace <code>Number.each</code> blocks with explicit <code>while</code>
loops.
</p>
<p>
Next we used excellent
<a href="https://github.com/lunacookies/simple-kpc">simple-kpc</a>
library to capture CPU counters on Apple M1 CPU, namely we collect total
cycles, total instructions count, branches, branch mispredictions, and
load/stores (<code>FIXED_CYCLES</code>, <code>FIXED_INSTRUCTIONS</code>,
<code>INST_BRANCH</code>, <code>BRANCH_MISPRED_NONSPEC</code>, and
<code>INST_LDST</code> respectively).
</p>
<p>
Naturally, we also collect the total execution time.
</p>
<p>
All the benchmarks compare vanilla bytecode interpretation against the
“unrolled” compiled version.
</p>
<p>
We are using mruby 3.0. While it’s not the most recent version at the
time of writing, it was the most recent version at the time we’ve build
the compiler.
</p>
<p>
The following chart shows the results of our measurements.The three
versions we compare are the baseline on the left, compiled version
without optimizations in the middle, and the compiled version plus
<a href="https://github.com/DragonRuby/lightstorm/blob/09042d2026f9251ff32ec079d99bf8ca2e5a6337/lib/optimizations/optimizations.cpp#L14">simple
escape analysis</a> and common subexpression elimination (CSE) on the
right side.
</p>
<p>
<em>The raw data and the formulas are
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KQdZjll0cOjWhfPO3KM-FN-OciUW53IecGOtTY6aYJM/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</em>
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://blog.llvm.org/img/ruby-compiler/benchmark.png" alt="Benchmarks">
</p>
<p>
With all the current optimizations in place both the number of cycles
and the total execution time went down by roughly ~30%.
</p>
<p>
We are able to eliminate ~17% of branches and ~28% of load/stores, while
the branch misses were cut in half with ~55% decrease.
</p>
<p>
The numbers look promising, although the amount of load/stores and
branches will certainly go up as we implement all the language features
due to the way blocks and exceptions are handled.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, we didn’t touch the runtime implementation which
together with LTO will enable some more improvements due to more
inlining.
</p>
<h2 id="where-to-next">
Where to next?
</h2>
<p>
As mentioned in the beginning, some parts of the engine itself are
written in C with and some of them are purely due to performance
reasons. We are looking into replacing those critical pieces with
compiled Ruby. While we may still pay performance penalty, we hope that
ease of maintenance will be worthwile.
