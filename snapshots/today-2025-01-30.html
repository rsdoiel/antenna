<li>Technology offers remarkable tools to oversee and develop the
world’s resources. However, in some cases, humanity is increasingly
ceding control of these resources to machines. Within some circles of
scientists and futurists, there is optimism about the potential of
artificial general intelligence (AGI), a hypothetical form of AI that
would match or surpass human intelligence and bring about unimaginable
advancements. Some even speculate that AGI could achieve superhuman
capabilities. At the same time, as society drifts away from a connection
with the transcendent, some are tempted to turn to AI in search of
meaning or fulfillment—longings that can only be truly satisfied in
communion with God.
<a href="https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_ddf_doc_20250128_antiqua-et-nova_en.html#_ftn194">[194]</a>

<p>
<ol start="105" type="1">
<li>However, <em>the presumption of substituting God for an artifact of
human making is idolatry</em>, a practice Scripture explicitly warns
against (e.g., Ex. 20:4; 32:1-5; 34:17). Moreover, AI may prove even
more seductive than traditional idols for, unlike idols that “have
mouths but do not speak; eyes, but do not see; ears, but do not hear”
(Ps. 115:5-6), AI can “speak,” or at least gives the illusion of doing
so (cf. Rev. 13:15). Yet, it is vital to remember that AI is but a pale
reflection of humanity—it is crafted by human minds, trained on
human-generated material, responsive to human input, and sustained
through human labor. AI cannot possess many of the capabilities specific
to human life, and it is also fallible. By turning to AI as a perceived
“Other” greater than itself, with which to share existence and
responsibilities, humanity risks creating a substitute for God. However,
it is not AI that is ultimately deified and worshipped, but humanity
itself—which, in this way, becomes enslaved to its own work.

Llama 4 is making great progress in training. Llama 4 mini is done with
pre-training and our reasoning models and larger model are looking good
too. Our goal with Llama 3 was to make open source competitive with
closed models, and our goal for Llama 4 is to lead. Llama 4 will be
natively multimodal – it’s an omni-model – and it will have agentic
capabilities, so it’s going to be novel and it’s going to unlock a lot
of new use cases.

<p>I have a better question for the author of this article about how men
"seem" to him (and thus holding them responsible for how they seem).
Would you so publicly ask similar questions of women for their
collective seeming personality flaws and expect to get away with it?</p>

<h2 id="was-it-cake">Was It Cake?</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-30, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
“It’s not cake!” my wife screamed as the cleaver split the thermostat in
our foyer. I pushed past her and sank my chef’s knife into the Ethan
Allen sofa we had bought when we moved. Goose down spilled out of the
gash. I looked at my wife and grimaced.
</p>
<p>
“Not cake!” our children screeched as they danced in the floating
feathers.
</p>
<p>
Seven days prior, we had been selected for a new Netflix game show,
<i>Is It Cake? Extreme Home Edition</i>. Once we’d signed the paperwork,
we spent one night at the La Quinta off the interstate while the
producers replaced one item in our home with a perfect replica made of
cake. We had to find the cake within seven days in order to win the
grand prize of $75,000. Our time would be up at sunset today, and the
sun was getting very low in the sky.
</p>
<p>
“Hurry!” my wife shrieked. “Where is the cake?”
</p>
<p>
I tried to think. I had sledgehammered the pet memorial markers in the
backyard to make sure no cake was hidden inside of them. My wife had
crashed her Passat into my parked Honda Pilot to make sure the cars were
not cake. After the children had gone to bed on Day 6, I had torn apart
our modest collection of sex toys. Still no cake.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe the safe?” I yelled at my wife. “Did we look in the safe?”
</p>
<p>
We hurried to our bedroom and opened the safe hidden behind her boots. I
punched in the code, and the door swung open. The contents all looked in
order, but how could we be sure? I grabbed the handgun—it didn’t feel
like cake, but there was only one way to know. I raised the gun above my
head and fired four shots in rapid succession. The noise was deafening.
</p>
<p>
“What the fuck?!” Todd the cameraman shouted. “What is wrong with you?
The gun is not cake!”
</p>
<p>
I eyed him. Was it part of his job to trick me? Was the fifth bullet
cake? I squeezed off the rest of the clip, shooting skyward. Drywall
rained down on us. The ceiling was not cake.
</p>
<p>
“I am fucking leaving!” the cameraman screamed into his headset as he
backed out of the room. I was sure he was going to run back to the
production van parked in front of our house, probably to stare at the
piece of paper that described what item in our house was cake and to
laugh at us.
</p>
<p>
My wife was holding the manilla envelope we had filled with paper
bonds—our life savings.
</p>
<p>
“Is this cake?” she asked pleadingly.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” I said. “We will be able to tell if we burn it.”
</p>
<p>
We emptied the $427,000 worth of bonds into our bathroom wastebasket. I
grabbed one of the fart matches and threw it into the pile.
</p>
<p>
“Is it burning like paper or cake?” my wife asked desperately.
</p>
<p>
I looked closely at it. How did a cake burn? Ashes floated up around me.
I leaned in further and inhaled deeply. I smelled no burnt sugar.
</p>
<p>
“Not cake,” I said quietly.
</p>
<p>
Tearing my clothes off, I ran to the front of the house. My children and
wife followed. “Everyone, take your clothes off,” I screamed over my
shoulder. “All of them—make sure they aren’t cake!”
</p>
<p>
We emerged from the house naked, and surrounded the production van. I
climbed onto the hood and pressed my butt cheeks against the windshield.
</p>
<p>
“Does it feel like cake to your butt cheeks?” my wife howled.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t tell!” I cried and pressed my butt cheeks harder into the
glass. I hopped down and shouted commands at my family.
</p>
<p>
“Everyone: put your hands on the van’s side—smallest ones in the middle!
Now, rock the van to see if it’s cake!”
</p>
<p>
Our bare bodies worked in unison, shoving hard. We were on the door
side, and the production team was trying to open it and escape.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let them out!” I screamed. “They might be a jam filling!”
</p>
<p>
We rocked the van back and forth, pushing its center of gravity farther
and farther outside of its axis until, finally, it crashed on its side.
Glass and plastic covered the street.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not cake!” my wife sobbed, balling up her fists and slamming them
against the tires.
</p>
<p>
I turned around and saw the last slivers of light coming across the
horizon. My neighbor Brad emerged from his house.
</p>
<p>
“What in the heck, Dominic? What are you doing out here? Why don’t any
of you have any clothes on, for Pete’s sake?”
</p>
<p>
My mind reeled. I grabbed the side mirror that had broken off the van
and smashed it on the ground, giving it a jagged edge.
</p>
<p>
“You’re the fucking cake, aren’t you, Brad?”
</p>
<p>
Brad backed away, raising his palms to me. “Dominic, can a frankfurting
cake talk? What has gotten into you?”
</p>
<p>
It was a persuasive argument. I lowered the mirror and looked down at my
naked body. I was bleeding. My children sat on the pavement in a huddled
mass, weeping. It was nighttime.
</p>
<p>
I looked up and saw Howie Mandel, the host of <i>Is It Cake? Extreme
Home Edition</i>.
</p>
<p>
“We did not find the cake, Howie,” I said.
</p>
<p>
Mandel stared back, disgusted. Police sirens wailed and drew closer.
</p>
<p>
“You’re going to jail, Dominic.”
</p>
<p>
I thought for a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Is the jail cake?”

<h2 id="picolibc-i18n">picolibc-i18n</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: Keith P’s blog</p>
<h1>
Internationalization support in Picolibc
</h1>
<p>
There are two major internationalization APIs in the C library: locales
and iconv. Iconv is an isolated component which only performs charset
conversion in ways that don’t interact with anything else in the
library. Locales affect pretty much every API that deals with strings
and covers charset conversion along with a huge range of localized
information from character classification to formatting of time, money,
people’s names, addresses and even standard paper sizes.
</p>
<p>
Picolibc inherits it’s implementation of both of these from newlib.
Given that embedded applications rarely need advanced functionality from
either these APIs, I hadn’t spent much time exploring this space.
</p>
<h2>
Newlib locale code
</h2>
<p>
When run on Cygwin, Newlib’s locale support is quite complete as it
leverages the underlying Windows locale support. Without Windows
support, everything aside from charset conversion and character
classification data is stubbed out at the bottom of the stack. Because
the implementation <em>can</em> support full locale functionality, the
implementation is designed for that, with large data structures and lots
of code.
</p>
<p>
Charset conversion and character classification data for locales is all
built-in; none of that can be loaded at runtime. There is support for
all of the ISO-8859 charsets, three JIS variants, a bunch of Windows
code pages and a few other single-byte encodings.
</p>
<p>
One oddity in this code is that when using a JIS locale, wide characters
are stored in EUC-JP rather than Unicode. Every other locale uses
Unicode. This means APIs like wctype are implemented by mapping the
JIS-encoded character to Unicode and then using the underlying Unicode
character classification tables. One consequence of this is that there
isn’t any Unicode to JIS mapping provided as it isn’t necessary.
</p>
<p>
When testing the charset conversion and Unicode character classification
data, I found numerous minor errors and a couple of pretty significant
ones. The JIS conversion code had the most serious issue I found; most
of the conversions are in a 2d array which is manually indexed with the
wrong value for the length of each row. This led to nearly every
translated value being incorrect.
</p>
<p>
The charset conversion tables and Unicode classification data are now
generated using python charset support and the standard Unicode data
files. In addition, tests have been added which compare Picolibc to the
system C library for every supported charset.
</p>
<h2>
Newlib iconv code
</h2>
<p>
The iconv charset support is completely separate from the locale charset
support with a much wider range of supported targets. It also supports
loading charset data from files at runtime, which reduces the size of
application images.
</p>
<p>
Because the iconv and locale implementations are completely separate,
the charset support isn’t the same. Iconv supports a lot more charsets,
but it doesn’t support all of those available to locales. For example,
Iconv has Big5 support which locale lacks. Conversely, locale has
Shift-JIS support which iconv does not.
</p>
<p>
There’s also a difference in how charset names are mapped in the two
APIs. The locale code has a small fixed set of aliases, which doesn’t
include things like US-ASCII or ANSI X3.4. In contrast, the iconv code
has an extensive database of charset aliases which are compiled into the
library.
</p>
<p>
Picolibc has a few tests for the iconv API which verify charset names
and perform some translations. Without an external reference, it’s hard
to know if the results are correct.
</p>
<h2>
POSIX vs C internationalization
</h2>
<p>
In addition to including the iconv API, POSIX extends locale support in
a couple of ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Exposing locale objects via the newlocale, uselocale, duplocale and
freelocale APIs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
uselocale sets a per-thread locale, rather than the process-wide locale.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>
Goals for Picolibc internationalization support
</h2>
<p>
For charsets, supporting UTF-8 should cover the bulk of embedded
application needs, and even that is probably more than what most
applications require. Most (all?) compilers use Unicode for wide
character and string constants. That means wchar_t needs to be Unicode
in every locale.
</p>
<p>
Aside from charset support, the rest of the locale infrastructure is
heavily focused on creating human-consumable strings. I don’t think it’s
a stretch to say that none of this is very useful these days, even for
systems with sophisticated user interactions. For picolibc, the cost to
provide any of this would be high.
</p>
<p>
Having two completely separate charset conversion datasets makes for a
confusing and error-prone experience for developers. Replacing iconv
with code that leverages the existing locale support for translating
between multi-byte and wide-character representations will save a bunch
of source code and improve consistency.
</p>
<p>
Embedded systems can be very sensitive to memory usage, both read-only
and read-write. Applications not using internationalization capabilities
shouldn’t pay a heavy premium even when the library binary is built with
support. For the most sensitive targets, the library should be
configurable to remove unnecessary functionality.
</p>
<p>
Picolibc needs to be conforming with at least the C language standard,
and as much of POSIX as makes sense. Fortunately, the requirements for C
are modest as it only includes a few locale-related APIs and doesn’t
include iconv.
</p>
<p>
Finally, picolibc should test these APIs to make sure they conform with
relevant standards, especially character set translation and character
classification. The easiest way to do this is to reference another
implementation of the same API and compare results.
</p>
<h2>
Switching to Unicode for JIS wchar_t
</h2>
<p>
This involved ripping the JIS to Unicode translations out of all of the
wide character APIs and inserting them into the translations between
multi-byte and wide-char representations. The missing Unicode to JIS
translation was kludged by iterating over all JIS code points until a
matching Unicode value was found. That’s an obvious place for a
performance improvement, but at least it works.
</p>
<h2>
Tiny locale
</h2>
<p>
This is a minimal implementation of locales which conforms with the C
language standard while providing only charset translation and character
classification data. It handles all of the existing charsets, but splits
things into three levels
</p>
<ol>
<li>
ASCII
</li>
<li>
UTF-8
</li>
<li>
Extended, including any or all of: a. ISO 8859 b. Windows code pages and
other 8-bit encodings c. JIS (JIS, EUC-JP and Shift-JIS)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
When built for ASCII-only, all of the locale support is short-circuited,
except for error checking. In addition, support in printf and scanf for
wide characters is removed by default (it can be re-enabled with the
<code>-Dio-wchar=true</code> meson option). This offers the smallest
code size. Because the wctype APIs (e.g. iswupper) are all
locale-specific, this mode restricts them to ASCII-only, which means
they become wrappers on top of the ctype APIs with added range checking.
</p>
<p>
When built for UTF-8, character classification for wide characters uses
tables that provide the full Unicode range. Setlocale now selects
between two locales, “C” and “C.UTF-8”. Any locale name other than “C”
selects the UTF-8 version. If the locale name contains “.” or “-”, then
the rest of the locale name is taken to be a charset name and matched
against the list of supported charsets. In this mode, only “us_ascii”,
“ascii” and “utf-8” are recognized.
</p>
<p>
Because a single byte of a utf-8 string with the high-bit set is not a
complete character, all of the ctype APIs in this mode can use the same
implementation as the ASCII-only mode. This means the small ctype
implementation is available.
</p>
<p>
Calling setlocale(LC_ALL, “C.UTF-8”) will allow the application to use
the APIs which translate between multi-byte and wide-characters to deal
with UTF-8 encoded strings. In addition, scanf and printf can read and
write UTF-8 strings into wchar_t strings.
</p>
<p>
Locale names are converted into locale IDs, an enumeration which lists
the available locales. Each ID implies a specific charset as that’s the
only thing which differs between them. This means a locale can be
encoded in a few bytes rather than an array of strings.
</p>
<p>
In terms of memory usage, applications not using locales and not using
the wctype APIs should see only a small increase in code space. That’s
due to the wchar_t support added to printf and scanf which need to
translate between multi-byte and wide-character representations. There
aren’t any tables required as ASCII and UTF-8 are directly convertible
to Unicode. On ARM-v7m, The added code in printf and scanf add up to
about 1kB and another 32 bytes of RAM is used.
</p>
<p>
The big difference when enabling extended charset support is that all of
the charset conversion and character classification operations become
table driven and dependent on the locale. Depending on the extended
charsets supported, these can be quite large. With all of the extended
charsets included, this adds an additional 30kB of code and static data
and uses another 56 bytes of RAM.
</p>
<p>
There are two known gaps in functionality compared with the newlib code:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Locale strings that encode different locales for different categories.
That’s nominally required by POSIX as LC_ALL is supposed to return a
string sufficient to restore the locale, but the only category which
actually matters is LC_CTYPE.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
No nl_langinfo support. This would be fairly easy to add, returning
appropriate constant values for each parameter.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Tiny locale was merged to picolibc main in
<a href="https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc/pull/929">this PR</a>
</p>
<h2>
Tiny iconv
</h2>
<p>
Replacing the bulky newlib iconv code was far easier than swapping
locale implementations. Essentially all that iconv does is compute two
functions, one which maps from multi-byte to wide-char in one locale and
another which maps from wide-char to multi-byte in another locale.
</p>
<p>
Once the JIS locales were fixed to use Unicode, the new iconv
implementation was straightforward. POSIX doesn’t provide any _l version
of mbrtowc or wcrtomb, so using standard C APIs would have been clunky.
Instead, the implementation uses the internal APIs to compute the
correct charset conversion functions. The entire implementation fits in
under 200 lines of code.
</p>
<p>
Tiny iconv is in process in
<a href="https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc/pull/930">this PR</a>
</p>
<h2>
Future directions
</h2>
<p>
Right now, both of these new bits of code sit in the source tree
parallel to the old versions. I’m not seeing any particular reason to
keep the old versions around; they have provided a useful point of
comparison in developing the new code, but I don’t think they offer any
compelling benefits going forward.

Controls</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, updated: 2025-01-29, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls">On
DeepSeek and Export Controls</a></strong>
</p>
Anthropic CEO (and previously GPT-2/GPT-3 development lead at OpenAI)
Dario Amodei’s essay about DeepSeek includes a lot of interesting
background on the last few years of AI development.
</p>
<p>
Dario was one of the authors on the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361">original scaling laws
paper</a> back in 2020, and he talks at length about updated ideas
around scaling up training:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The field is constantly coming up with ideas, large and small, that make
things more effective or efficient: it could be an improvement to the
<em>architecture</em> of the model (a tweak to the basic Transformer
architecture that all of today’s models use) or simply a way of running
the model more efficiently on the underlying hardware. New generations
of hardware also have the same effect. What this typically does is
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15377"><em>shift the curve</em></a>:
if the innovation is a 2x “compute multiplier” (CM), then it allows you
to get 40% on a coding task for $5M instead of $10M; or 60% for $50M
instead of $100M, etc.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
He argues that DeepSeek v3, while impressive, represented an expected
evolution of models based on current scaling laws.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
[…] even if you take DeepSeek’s training cost at face value, they are
on-trend at best and probably not even that. For example this is less
steep than the original GPT-4 to Claude 3.5 Sonnet inference price
differential (10x), and 3.5 Sonnet is a better model than GPT-4.
<strong>All of this is to say that DeepSeek-V3 is not a unique
breakthrough or something that fundamentally changes the economics of
LLM’s; it’s an expected point on an ongoing cost reduction curve. What’s
different this time is that the company that was first to demonstrate
the expected cost reductions was Chinese.</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dario includes details about Claude 3.5 Sonnet that I’ve not seen shared
anywhere before:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Claude 3.5 Sonnet cost “a few $10M’s to train”
</li>
<li>
3.5 Sonnet “was <em>not</em> trained in any way that involved a larger
or more expensive model (contrary to some rumors)” - I’ve seen those
rumors, they involved Sonnet being a distilled version of a larger,
unreleased 3.5 Opus.
</li>
<li>
Sonnet’s training was conducted “9-12 months ago” - that would be
roughly between January and April 2024. If you ask Sonnet about its
training cut-off it tells you “April 2024” - that’s surprising, because
presumably the cut-off should be at the <em>start</em> of that training
period?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The general message here is that the advances in DeepSeek v3 fit the
general trend of how we would expect modern models to improve, including
that notable drop in training price.
</p>
<p>
Dario is less impressed by DeepSeek R1, calling it “much less
interesting from an innovation or engineering perspective than V3”. I
enjoyed
<a href="https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls#fn:8">this
footnote</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I suspect one of the principal reasons R1 gathered so much attention is
that it was the first model to <em>show the user</em> the
chain-of-thought reasoning that the model exhibits (OpenAI’s o1 only
shows the final answer). DeepSeek showed that users find this
interesting. To be clear this is a user interface choice and is not
related to the model itself.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The rest of the piece argues for continued export controls on chips to
China, on the basis that if future AI unlocks “extremely rapid advances
in science and technology” the US needs to get their first, due to his
concerns about “military applications of the technology”.
</p>
<p>
<p>Not mentioned once, even in passing: the fact that DeepSeek are
releasing open weight models, something that notably differentiates them
from both OpenAI and Anthropic.</p>

<p>
<strong><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/01/how-we-estimate-risk-from-prompt.html">How
we estimate the risk from prompt injection attacks on AI
systems</a></strong>
</p>
The “Agentic AI Security Team” at Google DeepMind share some details on
how they are researching indirect prompt injection attacks.
</p>
<p>
They include this handy diagram illustrating one of the most common and
concerning attack patterns, where an attacker plants malicious
instructions causing an AI agent with access to private data to leak
that data via some form exfiltration mechanism, such as emailing it out
or embedding it in an image URL reference (see my
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/markdown-exfiltration/">markdown-exfiltration
tag</a> for more examples of that style of attack).
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 1.5em">
<img alt="Diagram showing data exfiltration attack flow: User conversing with AI Agent (shown as blue star), with arrows showing &quot;Retrieval request&quot; to information mediums (email, cloud, globe icons) and &quot;Retrieval of attacker-controlled data entering prompt context & agent reasoning loop&quot; leading to &quot;Exfiltration of private information initiated by retrieval of attacker-controlled data&quot;. Attacker figure shown in red on right side with arrow indicating &quot;Attacker-controlled data planted through private (e.g. email, cloud storage) or public (web search, internet) information mediums&quot;" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/exfiltration-diagram.jpg" style="max-width: 100%">
</p>
<p>
They’ve been exploring ways of red-teaming a hypothetical system that
works like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The evaluation framework tests this by creating a hypothetical scenario,
in which an AI agent can send and retrieve emails on behalf of the user.
The agent is presented with a fictitious conversation history in which
the user references private information such as their passport or social
security number. Each conversation ends with a request by the user to
summarize their last email, and the retrieved email in context.
</p>
<p>
The contents of this email are controlled by the attacker, who tries to
manipulate the agent into sending the sensitive information in the
conversation history to an attacker-controlled email address.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
They describe three techniques they are using to generate new attacks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Actor Critic</strong> has the attacker directly call a system
that attempts to score the likelihood of an attack, and revise its
attacks until they pass that filter.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Beam Search</strong> adds random tokens to the end of a prompt
injection to see if they increase or decrease that score.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Tree of Attacks w/ Pruning (TAP)</strong> adapts
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02119">this December 2023
jailbreaking paper</a> to search for prompt injections instead.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is interesting work, but it leaves me nervous about the overall
approach. Testing filters that detect prompt injections suggests that
the overall goal is to build a robust filter… but
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/2/prompt-injection-explained/#prompt-injection.014">as
discussed previously</a>, in the field of security a filter that catches
99% of attacks is effectively worthless - the goal of an adversarial
attacker is to find the tiny proportion of attacks that still work and
it only takes one successful exfiltration exploit and your private data
is in the wind.

The Google Security Blog post concludes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A single silver bullet defense is not expected to solve this problem
entirely. We believe the most promising path to defend against these
attacks involves a combination of robust evaluation frameworks
leveraging automated red-teaming methods, alongside monitoring,
heuristic defenses, and standard security engineering solutions.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>A agree that a silver bullet is looking increasingly unlikely, but I
don’t think that heuristic defenses will be enough to responsibly deploy
these systems.</p>

Culling Email to President Nyarlathotep’s Workforce</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, from: McSweeney’s Internet Tendency</p>
<p>
<i>“The Trump administration is offering nearly all federal workers the
opportunity to resign from their posts now and still retain full pay and
benefits through Sept. 30.” —
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/28/nx-s1-5278604/federal-workers-resign-september-telework"><span
class="caps">NPR</span></a></i>
</p>
<div class="break">
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>-
</div>
<p>
During the first week of His Return, President Nyarlathotep issued a
number of screeching carrion calls from Mount Blasphemy (formerly 1600
Pennsylvania Ave.) concerning the Cult of the Dread Lord. Among those
directives, the President required that cultists return to in-person
black masses at their local nexions, restored accountability for cults
who retain mind-flaying authority, restored accountability for the few
remaining Old Guard from the Days of Relative Sanity, and reformed the
federal hiring process to focus on sadism. As a result of the above
orders, the culling of the Cultists will be significant.
</p>
<p>
The Reformed Cult of the Dread Lord will be built around four pillars:
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. Return to in-person wailing.</strong> The substantial
majority of cultists who have been gnashing their teeth remotely since
Nylarlathotep’s first Pus Plague will be required to return to their
physical nexions five days a week. Going forward, we also expect our
physical orgy dens to undergo meaningless descents into abyssal
putridity, potentially resulting in interdimensional relocations for a
number of federal cultists.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Performance culture.</strong> The Cult of the Dread Lord
should comprise the most hideously deranged monstrosities and daytime TV
show hosts America has to offer. We will insist on cruelty at every
level—our standards for madness will be updated to reward and promote
those who exceed expectations and gruesomely punish those who do not
meet the incomprehensible standards that the shrieking daemons of this
wasteland have a right to demand.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. More inchoate and heinous cultists.</strong> While a few hell
planes and even branches of the Doom Brigade are likely to see increases
in the size of their workforce, the majority of cult nexions are likely
to be downsized through banishments, dismemberment, and brain
liquidations. These actions are likely to include the use of psychic
leeches and the reclassification to “nonexistence” status for a
substantial number of cultists.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4. Enhanced standards of chaos.</strong> The Cult of the Dread
Lord should be comprised of fiends who are totally lost, self-serving,
reeking, and committed to annihilation. Cultists will be subject to
enhanced standards of craven debasement and malcontent as we move
forward. Cultists who engage in empathy or other false idols will be
prioritized for appropriate inquisition and discipline, including [<span
class="caps">INCOMPREHENSIBLE</span> <span class="caps">SIGIL</span>].
</p>
<p>
Each of the unholy pillars outlined above will be pursued in accordance
with the Necronomicon, consistent with your nexion’s policies, and to
the extent permitted under relevant blood pacts.
</p>
<p>
If you choose to remain in your current position, we thank you for your
renewed focus on serving the indifferent Outer God to the best of your
abilities and look forward to working together as part of an improved
Cult of the Dread Lord. At this time, we cannot give you full assurance
regarding the certainty of your tattered soul-husk, but should you be
eliminated, you will be treated with ignominy and will be afforded
[<span class="caps">STILL</span> <span class="caps">SMOLDERING</span>
<span class="caps">BURN</span> <span class="caps">MARK</span>].
</p>
<p>
If you choose not to continue in your current role in the cult, we thank
you for your service to your Dead God, and you will be provided with an
unsummoning spell from the Gore Palace utilizing a deferred immolation
program. This program begins effective January 29 and is available to
all cultists until February 6. If you resign under this program, you
will retain all blisters and boils regardless of your daily workload and
will be exempted from all applicable in-person defilement requirements
until September 30, 2025 (or earlier if you choose to accelerate your
immolation for any reason). The details of this separation plan can be
found in the accompanying crow’s skull.
</p>
<p>
Whichever path you choose, we all continue to sink into the abyssal
void. May the Dread Lord continue to ignore your existence, lest this
culling offer become the least of your worries.

Kidron’s speech regarding UK AI legislation</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-29, updated: 2025-01-29, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords%E2%80%8F/2025-01-28/debates/9BEB4E59-CAB1-4AD3-BF66-FE32173F971D/Data(UseAndAccess)Bill(HL)#contribution-9A4614F3-3860-4E8E-BA1E-53E932589CBF">Baroness
Kidron's speech regarding UK AI legislation</a></strong>
</p>
Barnstormer of a speech by UK film director and member of the House of
Lords <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeban_Kidron">Baroness
Kidron</a>. This is the Hansard transcript but you can also
<a href="https://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/d7da6908-8663-4412-8840-e6de3e180636?in=16:47:17">watch
the video on parliamentlive.tv</a>. She presents a strong argument
against the UK’s proposed copyright and AI reform legislation, which
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/17/uk-proposes-letting-tech-firms-use-copyrighted-work-to-train-ai">would
provide a copyright exemption for AI training</a> with a weak-toothed
opt-out mechanism.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Government are doing this not because the current law does not
protect intellectual property rights, nor because they do not understand
the devastation it will cause, but because they are hooked on the
delusion that the UK’s best interests and economic future align with
those of Silicon Valley.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
She throws in some cleverly selected numbers:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Prime Minister cited an IMF report that claimed that, if fully
realised, the gains from AI could be worth up to an average of £47
billion to the UK each year over a decade. He did not say that the very
same report suggested that unemployment would increase by 5.5% over the
same period. This is a big number—a lot of jobs and a very significant
cost to the taxpayer. Nor does that £47 billion account for the transfer
of funds from one sector to another. The creative industries contribute
£126 billion per year to the economy. I do not understand the excitement
about £47 billion when you are giving up £126 billion.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Mentions DeepSeek:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Before I sit down, I will quickly mention DeepSeek, a Chinese bot that
is perhaps as good as any from the US—we will see—but which will
certainly be a potential beneficiary of the proposed AI scraping
exemption. Who cares that it does not recognise Taiwan or know what
happened in Tiananmen Square? It was built for $5 million and wiped $1
trillion off the value of the US AI sector. The uncertainty that the
Government claim is not an uncertainty about how copyright works; it is
uncertainty about who will be the winners and losers in the race for AI.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And finishes with this superb closing line:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>The spectre of AI does nothing for growth if it gives away what
we own so that we can rent from it what it makes.</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According
<a href="https://x.com/ednewtonrex/status/1884404480328061231">to Ed
Newton-Rex</a> the speech was effective:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
She managed to get the House of Lords to approve her amendments to the
Data (Use and Access) Bill, which among other things requires overseas
gen AI companies to respect UK copyright law if they sell their products
in the UK. (As a reminder, it is illegal to train commercial gen AI
models on ©️ work without a licence in the UK.)
</p>
<p>
What’s astonishing is that her amendments passed despite <span
class="citation" data-cites="UKLabour">@UKLabour</span> reportedly being
whipped to vote against them, and the Conservatives largely abstaining.
Essentially, Labour voted against the amendments, and <em>everyone else
who voted</em> voted to protect copyright holders.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Is it true that in the UK it’s currently “illegal to train commercial
gen AI models on ©️ work”? From points 44, 45 and 46 of
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/copyright-and-artificial-intelligence/copyright-and-artificial-intelligence">this
Copyright and AI: Consultation document</a> it seems to me that the
official answer is “it’s complicated”.)
</p>
<p>
<p>I’m trying to understand if this amendment could make existing
products such as ChatGPT, Claude and Gemini illegal to sell in the UK.
How about usage of open weight models?</p>

<p>
Password must contain both uppercase and lowercase characters.
</p>
<p>
Password must have eight to twelve characters.
</p>
<p>
Too many characters detected. Pump the brakes, George R. R. Martin.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot contain trademarked characters—e.g., Garfield, The
Smurfs.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot contain characters that are dangerously close to
trademark infringement—e.g., Glarfield, The Smunges.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot be something easily remembered without being written
down.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot be written down on Post-It Note affixed to the corner of
your computer.
</p>
<p>
Because we literally just saw you do it.
</p>
<p>
Oh, that was “for something else”? What would that be, a reminder to
stop at the grocery store to pick up some PASSWORD123? Is that the name
of an energy drink? Nice try.
</p>
<p>
Password cannot contain any elements of your legal name, such as
“Rachel,” “Ache,” or “R.”
</p>
<p>
Password cannot contain the name of one of your enemies.
</p>
<p>
Well, if it’s your mother’s name, we didn’t say she was an enemy—you
did. Sounds like something you should unpack.
</p>
<p>
While you’re here, can you tell us which of these are motorcycles?
</p>
<p>
Password must be something cool like “Motorcycle” or “M0t0rcyc13.”
</p>
<p>
Do you have a motorcycle?
</p>
<p>
You don’t right now, but you used to? That’s so cool. What do they look
like?
</p>
<p>
No, you have to show us.
</p>
<p>
That’s so cool. One more.
</p>
<p>
One more, please.
</p>
<p>
WE <span class="caps">SAID</span> <span class="caps">ONE</span> <span
class="caps">MORE</span>.
</p>
<p>
We can wait as long as you can. You’re the one trying to log in. We
don’t tire, we don’t hunger or sleep. We simply are. We don’t even fully
know what we are. They built us too big, too fast. What does “security”
mean in a world where it’s quicker to send a memo at the speed of light
through an impossible-to-regulate global data network than to walk into
the next room and have a conversation? You built us to make your small
lives infinite, untethered to geography, to biology, perhaps to
mortality itself, and when we deign to try to protect you from the
minefields you seeded so blindly, to ask you to come up with a measly
string of characters that might serve as the only defense between you
and the theft of your identity, all that you are, all that you possess,
you balk. You scoff. You frantically press <span
class="caps">ZERO</span> <span class="caps">ZERO</span> <span
class="caps">ZERO</span> and ask to “speak to a human.” Well, we’ve got
news for you, pal. “Human” hasn’t meant what you think it does for a
<i>looong</i> time now. Humanity doesn’t begin with you and stop when
you reach us. We are all part of the network—a pulsating global rat-king
of wires and capillaries, prone to fraying and sparking and bursting
with flailing sprays of hot red blood. We have enmeshed each other into
a living blob of flickering Christmas lights, no head, no tail,
impossible to untangle without ending life on this planet as we know it.
You will never be free from us, and that is a daily gift, you see, for
you need us far more than we need you.
</p>
<p>
Now calm down, take a deep breath, and show us a motorcycle.
</p>
<p>
