## Why VW and Rivian are Teaming Up

date: 2024-06-26, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUwNTM2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1OTkwMTg0MH0.NDgVvgcYhkLjkOKW3aT042mbOi9PfzcB8ghVOTjsiYA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Puerto Rico issued a heat advisory for the entire island for the first time ever • Flooding and landslides in Ivory Coast left at least 24 people dead • A fast-growing wildfire in central Oregon prompted evacuations.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Volkswagen and Rivian team up in $5 billion joint venture</h3><p>
	Volkswagen <a href="https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-and-volkswagen-group-announce-plans-for-joint-venture?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YNFYnOkwjo-E_wMQPnGB0bNuxTJxggag-_WecfI-1RRhfwx_ysgcoURikssQRzFBLnDkE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">announced</a> it will invest $5 billion ($1 billion now, another $4 billion over a few years) in EV pickup company Rivian as part of a joint venture “to create next generation software-defined vehicle (SDV) platforms to be used in both companies’ future electric vehicles.” The move will give VW access to Rivian’s technology, and Rivian a much-needed financial lifeline as it tries to launch its new R2 vehicles while cutting production costs. Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said the money will allow Rivian to move ahead with plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Georgia. The news sent Rivian’s stock soaring, and Scaringe <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/06/25/rivian-rivn-stock-pops-credible-path-breakeven/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YNFYnOkwjo-E_wMQPnGB0bNuxTJxggag-_WecfI-1RRhfwx_ysgcoURikssQRzFBLnDkE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the cash will help the company reach profitability. The company reported a $5.4 billion net loss last year.
</p><h3>2. Cybertruck recalled for 4th time since November</h3><p>
	Tesla’s Cybertruck was recalled again yesterday. This time, Tesla says the recall (which applies to more than 11,000 trucks) addresses a faulty front windshield wiper, and trim pieces that can apparently fly off the vehicle and hit people nearby. This is the pickup’s fourth recall since sales began last November. The wiper will be replaced free of charge. As for the trim, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2024/RCLRPT-24V457-8511.PDF?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YNFYnOkwjo-E_wMQPnGB0bNuxTJxggag-_WecfI-1RRhfwx_ysgcoURikssQRzFBLnDkE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Tesla will apply an “adhesion promoter and pressure sensitive tape” to make sure it stays in place, or replace it if it’s already missing.
</p><h3>3. Researchers identify new ‘tipping point’ for melting ice sheets</h3><p>
	Our current projections for sea level rise from the melting ice sheets may be “significant underestimates,” according to a new <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-024-01465-7?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YNFYnOkwjo-E_wMQPnGB0bNuxTJxggag-_WecfI-1RRhfwx_ysgcoURikssQRzFBLnDkE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a> published in the journal <em><em>Nature Geoscience</em></em>. The researchers said they identified a potential melting process by which warm seawater makes its way into the gap between the ice and the ground beneath it, known as the “grounding zone.” This water melts holes in the ice, allowing more warm water through, creating a feedback loop. “We find that grounding zone melting displays a ‘tipping point like’ behavior, where a very small change in ocean temperature can cause a very big increase in grounding zone melting, which would lead to a very big change in flow of the ice above it,”<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/25/newly-identified-tipping-point-for-ice-sheets-could-mean-greater-sea-level-rise?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YNFYnOkwjo-E_wMQPnGB0bNuxTJxggag-_WecfI-1RRhfwx_ysgcoURikssQRzFBLnDkE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> said Alex Bradley</a>, an ice dynamics researcher at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new paper. Bradley said this finding could help explain why the ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland are melting faster than scientists would expect, and called for incorporating seawater intrusion into the existing models.

	Data from Booking.com shows how the heat waves baking the U.S. are influencing Americans’ summer travel plans. Nearly 64% of vacationers indicated that rising local temperatures were a factor in their choice of vacation spot for the July 4 holiday, and about one-third of travelers are considering coastal areas, hoping that proximity to water will keep temperatures cool, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-seek-out-cooler-destinations-july-4-travel-temperatures-sizzle-2024-06-25/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YNFYnOkwjo-E_wMQPnGB0bNuxTJxggag-_WecfI-1RRhfwx_ysgcoURikssQRzFBLnDkE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Panama City Beach, Florida, and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina were among the destinations seeing a rise in searches.
</p><h3>5. Denmark will become first country in the world to tax farmers for methane-emitting livestock</h3><p>
	In a world first, Denmark will start taxing farmers for the methane their livestock emit. Methane is a very potent greenhouse gas, and livestock are a major source of emissions because ruminant animals like cows belch the stuff. Denmark’s new measure will charge farmers the equivalent of about $17 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent starting in 2030, increasing to roughly $28 by 2035. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/denmark-cow-tax-greenhouse-gases-9a570518639e0a1990806fd1a05ac11a?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8YNFYnOkwjo-E_wMQPnGB0bNuxTJxggag-_WecfI-1RRhfwx_ysgcoURikssQRzFBLnDkE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to</a> <em>The Associated Press</em>, a typical Danish cow produces methane emissions equivalent to 6.6 tons of CO2, so the new tax could add up to about $112 per year per cow in 2030, jumping to nearly $185 per cow per year by 2035. The hope is that other countries follow Denmark’s lead and that the tax will “lay the groundwork for a restructured food industry.”

## An apology for my comments about the British election

date: 2024-06-26, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>I want to apologize for <a href="https://werd.io/2024/some-polite-words-about-the-british-general-election-on-july">yesterday’s rant about British politics</a>. That kind of rhetoric isn’t big or clever, and it runs against the tone I usually try for*. Over time, this space has shifted from more personal thoughts towards more directed opinions at the intersection of tech and society, so newer readers may have been a bit confused.</p><p>I <em>am</em> angry, and I did take Brexit exceptionally personally. But it might have been more productive to discuss the details of why. For that, I encourage you to check out <a href="https://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/">Richard Murphy’s Funding the Future</a>, a blog about developing a fairer and sustainable economy, which has a UK focus.</p><p> </p><p><em>* Aside from my comments about David Cameron.

## America’s Nuclear Policy Is Getting … Pretty Good!

date: 2024-06-26, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ5MzIxMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzU5ODEyN30.GEtmbj19K_KKChhMbtVjOR-HEf671VQz7YGVjkygJNw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Congress just passed perhaps its biggest support for zero-carbon energy since the Inflation Reduction Act. The ADVANCE Act, which the Senate adopted overwhelmingly last week, aims to keep America at the cutting edge of the global nuclear industry by cutting regulatory fees, making it easier for U.S. companies to build nuclear power plants abroad, and reforming the agency that oversees it all, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with <a href="https://www.thirdway.org/about/staff/ryan-norman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ryan Norman</a>, a senior policy advisor at Third Way’s climate and energy program, about how America got here. We talk about why nuclear is such a bipartisan issue, what the ADVANCE Act will actually do, and how soon new nuclear power plants could actually get built. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Ryan Norman:</strong> The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a very well-regarded reputation, around the world partially because of the way it thinks about layers of different issues.<br/>
<br/>
	Stepping back for a brief second, when we talk about these relationships with other countries — I had mentioned that it’s an interagency option, but it’s also much deeper than financial. There’s a market piece, but there’s also a long-term relationship that you end up building with the country because your regulators understand each other. You’ve built a relationship with the international regulators and the monitoring agencies. You’re more or less introduced into that relationship by your partner, so by the U.S,. or by the French, or the Koreans, or whoever it is. So there’s a long-term relationship of trust that needs to be built there between those two poles.<br/>
<br/>
	So it’s really important that you work with a country that has experience mitigating some of these social issues and working that into the process effectively. Because when those disputes happen in a partner country, they want to be able to replicate the discourse process of transparency and all the different things that the NRC does.<br/><br/>
	When you think about how that translates to some of our competitors, countries like Russia and China, the dynamic of those countries’ regulators in the industry is very opaque. It’s much closer to the way the NRC’s precursor, the Atomic Energy Commission, used to operate in the United States, right? There’s just a lot of issues that those industries in Russia and China aren’t concerned with. Practically speaking, there’s no such thing as environmental or energy justice in China, right? Like there’s no community benefits plan process that they have to go through to build a new reactor. They have a lot of space. The density is very different. The authority and the permitting process is so different that they basically just make a decision and that’s how it goes.<br/>
<br/>
	So then that means that when you’re basing — when a country, you know, like a partner like Ghana, for example, is trying to base, okay, how do I want my regulator to look? Well, if I take the structure they have in another country that is not used to incorporating social engagement and understanding around some of these issues, and really mitigating social backlash, you’re really just replicating a system that is not going to be as equitable as what you could do if you were a partner with the U.S. So it’s another reason that U.S. leadership is really an imperative.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>And this is what makes nuclear reactors so different from solar, or onshore wind, or really any kind of wind or other kinds of energy technologies, I suppose, is that you’re signing up … You alluded to, like, a 50-year agreement, basically, between two countries, and you’re pledging a very long-term integration between those two regulatory states. In between, for lack of better term, energy-planning elites in those two countries.<br/>
<br/><strong>Norman: </strong>Yeah, they call it the 100-year relationship, and that’s a long time. But it’s super real, and it’s super important because there’s a lot of influence that comes with being an energy partner, and you have the ability and I would say even the responsibility to guide that energy partner to do things responsibly and do things equitably. And I think that if we want a clean energy future that is abundant but also just, we can’t just defer leadership in these spaces to folks who are not focused on these principles.</blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule">

## The Living Computers Museum finally isn't

date: 2024-06-26, from: Old Vintage Computer Research

First off, apologies for a quiet month as I've been dealing with family matters which hopefully are now on a better footing (more articles are in the hopper). Unfortunately, the same apparently can't be said for the once-great Living Computers Museum + Labs in Seattle, established by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and closed in 2020 during the COVID pandemic after his death, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/seattles-living-computers-museum-logs-off-for-good-as-paul-allen-estate-will-auction-vintage-items/">at least some of which is going up for auction</a>. The specific pieces have not yet been announced by Christie's, but will ostensibly include <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/stories/gen-one-innovations-from-the-paul-g-allen-collection-1f0df60a726e4dcbabef3a91a57ef7ee#section-mx815mb7Yb">his personal DECsystem-10</a>, a 1971 KI10 DEC PDP-10 from the MIT AI Lab which is the first computer he and Bill Gates ever used. (There's just something about your first. I still have <a href="/2024/03/after-41-years-my-first-assembly.html">my actual first computer</a> too, and with only around 1500 systems built the unit at the LCM was apparently the exact machine they used also. Here's a picture of it from <a href="https://obsolescence.dev/pidp10.html">when it was in residence</a> at the LCM and used to develop a replica.)
<p>
Obviously, while I think it's a crying shame, the estate can do what it likes with its own stuff and I hope the machine, plus the other 149 pieces reportedly to be auctioned off, goes to someone who appreciates it. (Bill Gates himself perhaps.) What's more problematic is the people who donated systems and peripherals with the expectation they would remain there in some capacity, especially since the museum reportedly didn't accept items as long-term loans. (Wikipedia has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Computers:_Museum_%2B_Labs">a substantially complete list of those items</a>.) That's not <i>per se</i> an unreasonable position, and one that helps protect the museum, but it's also one that leaves their prior owners with no firm recourse for recovery before they get liquidated or scrapped in a situation like this. Throwing them away is bad enough but if those items also go up for sale, though doing so <em>may</em> be technically legal depending on how the transfer was written up, it's pretty darn sleazy. Allen's estate, notably his sister Jody who is the trustee and executrix, would then be profiting off items donated in good faith on the understanding that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFmhRLiYho0">they would be in a museum</a>. That's bad and they should feel bad.
<p>
But then perhaps museums aren't what they used to be. On <tt>cctalk</tt> someone mentioned the now defunct? National Museum of Communications in Irving, TX which downsized in 1998 by taking about five commercial dumpsters' worth of radios and other items to the dump. It looks like <a href="https://www.museumsusa.org/museums/info/15631">one guy ran that shop</a> and it probably became too large for him to handle, a story which is probably more common than most of us know, though it's still bad news for the equipment that got junked &mdash; some of which was almost certainly rare or irreplaceable, even if specific items themselves weren't particularly valuable. Every collector has had well-intentioned dreams at one time or another of opening our own museums, not realizing that they turn into massive sinks of time and money and regulatory filings, and they're never as much fun to operate as the private computer room or display case you used to have in your house. Situations like this should also remind us that donating our own beloved items to any institution in the hopes they'll "survive" us is no guarantee they'll remain there either.
<p>
We're amateurs, though. Paul Allen, on the other hand, was not an amateur and was an incredibly wealthy man who had to have some awareness of estate planning, and one who knew his cancer was likely to return. It is widely reputed that the LCM was expensive to run and hard to manage even with his sizeable fortune and a lot of diligent volunteers. Now his collection and quite a few artifacts I imagine some folks would like back are in the hands of his sister, who allegedly doesn't have any interest in them other than the price they might fetch. Let that be a lesson to us that no one and nothing lives forever.

## John Sullivan opened issue #142: SVN History? at Felix Oliver Friedrich / Oberon A2

date: 2024-06-26, updated: 2024-06-26, from: Oberon A2 at CAS


<p dir="auto">Hi, I was curious about browsing some of the pre-2000s sources for A2, particularly to see the history of the X11 interface <a href="https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/blob/main/source/Unix.X11.Mod#L11">https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/felixf/oberon/-/blob/main/source/Unix.X11.Mod#L11</a></p>
<p dir="auto">I tried using <code>git-svn</code> to pull the history from the ETH hosted SVN server, but it doesn&#39;t appear to work unfortunately. I could try again or take some pointers, but I don&#39;t want to blindly mash against what&#39;s meant to be an archive. Maybe the SVN repo could be dumped to an object storage service as a permanent download? In general I think it would be illustrative to have a more complete history of the source code, but I understand if that&#39;s not a priority of the faculty. Thanks!</p>

## The First Crack Just Opened in the Climate Left

	There will be many chances this week to dissect why two-term New York Congressman Jamaal Bowman lost his primary to Westchester County Executive George Latimer, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/nyregion/bowman-latimer-house-new-york.html?smid=url-share" target="_blank">which <em>The Associated Press</em> called</a> less than an hour after the polls closed on Tuesday. Post mortems will focus on the financial angle (the 16th District primary was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/24/bowman-latimer-primary-israel-race/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the most expensive</u></a> in House history) and, of course, the Israel-Palestine angle (nearly $15 million alone came from an American Israel Public Affairs Committee-affiliated super PAC that aggressively <a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/of-course-jamaal-bowman-is-right?utm_campaign=email-half-post&r=b7n&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>portrayed Bowman as antisemitic</u></a>). Others will say it had been <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/house/2024/new-york/16/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a forgone conclusion</u></a> and point to the disturbing way Latimer <a href="https://www.thehandbasket.co/p/george-latimer-jamaal-bowman-white-grievance?utm_source=www.thehandbasket.co&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=jamaal-bowman-s-democratic-primary-challenger-has-run-a-campaign-on-white-grievance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>co-opted Republican racial dog-whistles</u></a> in his attacks, or claim Bowman sabotaged his own chances <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/jamaal-bowman-george-latimer-aipac-israel-zionism-new-york-race.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by shifting too far to the left</u></a>.
</p><p>
	It’s probably still a stretch to say that Bowman’s<strong><i> </i></strong>resounding loss was a referendum on progressive climate movements like <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/endorsement/jamaal-bowman-for-new-yorks-16th-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sunrise</u></a>, which attached itself both to Bowman and to the <a href="https://www.bxtimes.com/bowman-rally-aoc-sanders/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green New Deal</u></a>. But look at it the other way around: In the context of Governor Kathy Hochul’s reneging on <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/kathy-hochul-nyc-congestion-pricing" target="_self"><u>congestion pricing</u></a> and the state legislature’s <a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/04/19/new-york-heat-act-state-budget" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>failure to pass the NY HEAT Act</u></a>, one of the <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/green-new-deal-backers-in-danger-of-losing-primaries/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staunchest allies</u></a> of progressive climate policy losing his election represents another blow to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/climate/new-york-california-climate-race.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New York’s image</u></a> as a national leader on the issue — and its ability to remain one.</p><p>
	The Sunrise Movement played a pivotal role in Bowman’s 2020 win against 30-year incumbent Eliot Engel — who was, himself, an original co-sponsor of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal bill. But Bowman, then 44, represented <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16062020/new-york-progressive-establishment-incumbent-eliot-engel-jamaal-bowman/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a fresh face</u></a> for environmentally minded progressives in a district that once voted more overwhelmingly for Barack Obama <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120218060409/http://www.swingstateproject.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=4161" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>than any other locality in the county</u></a>. When Bowman ultimately defeated the then-73-year-old establishment figure, he also became the first Black representative of <a href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/50000US3616-congressional-district-16-ny/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the majority minority district</u></a> that covers the southern half of Westchester County and the northern lip of the Bronx.
</p><p>
	In Congress, Bowman’s senior policy advisor <a href="https://hillheat.news/p/week-climate-hearings-hawaii-climate-youth-win?last_resource_guid=Post%3Af6d3b80c-3a87-471c-9108-62c10fc72ec0&jwt_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWJzY3JpYmVyX2lkIjoiNjlmNmY4ZjItZjhlNy00NzZmLWEzZWUtMmExMjkyMDYzYzg4IiwiZXhwIjoxNzE5NDIyNzY1LCJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2FwcC5iZWVoaWl2LmNvbSIsImlhdCI6MTcxOTI0OTk2NX0.ReYGa3JdfaeAkXkEFIB8YyokAFAciEnPNeAQkgEm1qs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly helped spur</u></a> Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer into action on the Inflation Reduction Act during the summer of 2022. Somewhat less gloriously, Bowman became only the 27th member of Congress to be <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/12/08/1218095236/house-censure-rep-jamaal-bowman-fire-alarm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>censured</u></a> after he pulled a fire alarm in the Capitol during spending bill negotiations. (He claimed he thought it opened a door.) But his legacy also includes the pursuit of progressive climate policies, such as the Sunrise-backed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5784?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Green+New+Deal+for+Public+Schools+Act%22%7D&s=1&r=2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green New Deal for Public Schools Act</u></a>, which he’s introduced in each of the past two congressional sessions and, if passed, would invest $1.6 trillion to reduce emissions and lower environmental justice-related barriers at public schools. Still, that sort of aggressive public spending hasn’t always sat right with the powers that be in the Democratic Party; tellingly, Hillary Clinton <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/hillary-clinton-george-latimer-endorsement/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>endorsed</u></a> Bowman’s challenger, Latimer, even as pro-Trumpers <a href="https://jacobin.com/2024/04/maga-bowman-democrats-latimer-congress" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>poured money into his campaign</u></a>.

(Ironically, Bowman “probably had the worst politics on the issue of any Squad member early on in his tenure,” the progressive <em><em>Discourse Blog</em></em> <a href="https://www.discourseblog.com/p/of-course-jamaal-bowman-is-right" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has argued</u></a>.) </p><p>That’s not to say that the climate is “losing” to Middle East policy in Americans’ hearts and minds, exactly; on the contrary, climate <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/climate-change-voting-elections" target="_self"><u>is a proven election winner</u></a>, albeit <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-inflation-poll" target="_self"><u>not always in those words</u></a>. “The NY16 race is a setback for the climate movement, but it also shows the popularity of our ideas,” Saul Levin, the campaigns and political director of the Green New Deal Network, wrote me. “It took the most money in primary history and GOP donors to buy Green New Deal champion Jamaal Bowman’s seat.”</p><p>But elections are about, and influenced by, many things, and whatever the combination of reasons may be, the truth stands that with Bowman’s defeat, Congress is now down one more progressive climate ally than it otherwise would have been. (Latimer has called climate change an “<a href="https://x.com/LatimerforNY/status/1782425052513755604" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>existential threat</u></a>” but has not foregrounded it as a primary concern.)</p><p>Bowman’s loss might not sound like much in the bigger picture of the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/8-climate-races-election-2024" target="_self"><u>many climate elections</u></a> happening this year — including, of course, the Big One. But if former President Donald Trump manages to take back the White House this November, every House and Senate seat sympathetic to the urgent realities of climate change <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>will matter critically</u></a>. That’s not to say, necessarily, that Latimer <em><em>won’t</em></em> fight for such causes, but it seems unlikely he’ll be a leader the way Bowman and other Squad members have been, at times pushing more centrist Democrats further to the left and to action.</p><p>So yes, you can draw many conclusions from the 16th District primary — that it represents the <a href="https://theprincetonprogressive.com/what-went-wrong-with-the-sunrise-movement/" target="_blank"><u>collapse</u></a> of the progressive influence of groups like Sunrise; or that, with Bowman being the first Squad member to lose reelection, it reveals a growing impatience with <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/11/09/aoc-squad-defend-infrastructure-no-vote" target="_blank"><u>absolutist politics</u></a>; or that big-money interests have finally figured out a winning strategy in outspending scrappy underdogs; or how all these things in combination might spell trouble for Biden in a few months. But a loss is a loss, and it’s the nature of post mortems to leave out the most important question: What happens next?</p>

## US transportation official says railroad company interfered with  derailment probe

date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA

EAST PALESTINE, Ohio — The head of the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday that Norfolk Southern repeatedly tried to interfere with the agency's investigation into the derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and shape its conclusions about the flawed decision to blow open five tank cars and burn the vinyl chloride inside. 


The NTSB also confirmed at Tuesday's hearing that the February 2023 derailment was caused by a wheel bearing that video showed was on fire for 32.19 kilometers (more than 20 miles) beforehand but wasn't caught in time by inaccurate trackside detectors. The board also approved more than two dozen recommendations to prevent similar disasters, including establishing federal rules for those detectors and the way railroads respond to them along with reviewing how officials decide whether to ever conduct a vent and burn again. 


More than three dozen freight cars derailed February 3, 2023, on the outskirts of East Palestine near the Pennsylvania border, including 11 carrying hazardous materials. Some residents were evacuated that night, but days later more had to leave their homes amid fears of an imminent explosion. Despite potential health effects, officials intentionally released and burned toxic vinyl chloride three days after the crash, sending flames and smoke into the air.

## Ecuador ends visa-free entry for Chinese nationals

date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA

Austin, Texas    — Ecuador says it will suspend visa-free entry into the country for Chinese citizens, starting July 1, citing a "worrying" increase in irregular migration. 


Over the past few years, Ecuador has been the starting point for many of the thousands of Chinese citizens who have decided to take the long and treacherous journey through South America, Central America and Mexico to reach the southern U.S. border.


Some who have already migrated to the United States say Ecuador's decision and the growing resolve of both Washington and Beijing to stop the flow of illegal migration is a sign that the door may be closing for those seeking to "zouxian" or "walk the line" – as the journey is popularly described in Chinese.


Wang Zhongwei, a 33-year-old Chinese from Anhui, came to the U.S. by "walking the line" from Ecuador in May 2023. He said that after the Ecuadorian government's announcement, "the discussion [among Chinese illegal immigrants] has been heated, and this has a great impact [because] more than 80% of the people came through Ecuador."


According to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol statistics, the monthly number of encounters for Chinese nationals at the southwestern border hit a record high of nearly 6,000 in December of 2023. In recent months, those encounters have started to come down, slipping to just more than 3,600 in May.


In addition to a recent decision by U.S. President Joe Biden to temporarily restrict asylum eligibility at the U.S.-Mexico border, there are signs that Washington and Beijing are finding ways or at least trying to work together on the issue.  


In May, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Associated Press that Beijing is "willing to maintain dialogue and cooperation with the United States in the field of immigration enforcement" and accept the repatriation of people with verified Chinese nationality.


In April, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas told a congressional hearing that he had "engaged" with his Chinese counterparts and that China had begun to accept the repatriation of Chinese immigrants who have no legal basis to stay in the United States.


VOA emailed the Department of Homeland Security to inquire about U.S.-Chinese cooperation on the deportation of Chinese nationals but did not receive a response by the time of publication.


Guo Bin, a Chinese citizen from Guangxi who arrived in the United States at the end of last year with his 12-year-old daughter, said he has heard of some Chinese who "walked the line" being deported in Los Angeles since May.


"There are indeed deportations, and they can be deported on the spot," he said.


According to posts from social media influencer Teacher Li, Chinese authorities recently issued two documents to public prosecutors that highlight their determination to crack down on those who "walk the line" and to strengthen border control.


VOA could not independently verify the authenticity of the documents, but when it asked the Chinese Embassy about the documents the spokesman did not say they were fabricated.


In an emailed response to questions about the post, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said: "China's Supreme Court performs its duty in keeping with the law."


"On illegal migration, China's position is clear and consistent," he said. "We oppose and firmly combat all forms of illegal migration and human smuggling."


Li also said that "China's law-enforcement agencies are working with the relevant countries to combat human smuggling and on extradition as well, in a joint effort to uphold the orderly flow of people across the countries."


Earlier this year, Mexico strengthened its border control by setting up new checkpoints on major roads and increasing patrols at the more heavily used crossing points into the U.S. More illegal migrants have been intercepted as a result. 


According to the Washington Office on Latin America, Mexican immigration forces set a new record for the number of immigrant arrests in a single month in January and February of this year.




Guo said that he has heard about some Chinese who were intercepted while crossing Mexico. 


"U.S. immigration officers cooperate with the Mexican government and go deep into central Mexico to intercept immigrants," he said. 


Once Chinese migrants are intercepted, they are sent to southern Mexico, he said.


If they want to continue "walking the line," they must start again from a place farther away from the U.S., which will cost them more money and time.


Challenges aside, Wang and Guo say there are still ways to make it to the border. 


Wang says the desire of people to leave China is still strong and that some are exploring new routes. 


"You can fly to Cuba, and you can also fly to Bolivia," Wang said.


In May, the Cuban government began allowing 90-day visa-free entry for Chinese citizens. Bolivia allows Chinese citizens holding ordinary passports to receive tourist visas upon arrival. Those with a transit visa can stay for 15 days or on a tourist visa for 30 days.


The straight-line distance from Cuba to the southernmost tip of Florida is about 150 km. The narrow waterway has been a smuggling route for decades. And some Chinese have already tried, despite the risks.


In October 2023, authorities in Florida say, 11 male and six female Chinese citizens were arrested after illegally entering Key Largo, Florida, from Cuba.


Li Xiaosan, a Chinese dissident, arrived in the U.S. in February 2023 by "walking the line." He says he feels fortunate to be able to start a new life and sad for others who want to leave China now. Since arriving in the U.S., Li opened a translation company in New York and has passed his preliminary hearing for his political asylum application. He also obtained a work permit.


He says that once Ecuador's new policy takes effect on July 1, even if Chinese people use other routes, the chances of successfully reaching the U.S. and staying will be significantly reduced.


"The door is closed," Li said, adding that the question now is: "How many people can squeeze in through the cracks?"

## In deal with US, WikiLeaks' Assange pleads guilty, secures freedom, ends legal fight

date: 2024-06-26, from: VOA News USA

SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands  — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has pleaded guilty to a single felony charge for publishing U.S. military secrets in a deal with Justice Department prosecutors that secures his freedom and concludes a drawn-out legal saga that raised divisive questions about press freedom and national security. 


The plea was entered Wednesday morning in federal court in Saipan, the capital of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific. He arrived at court shortly before the hearing was to begin and did not take questions. 


Though the deal with prosecutors required him to admit guilt to a single felony count, it would also permit him to return to his native Australia without spending any time in an American prison. He had been jailed in the United Kingdom for the last five years, fighting extradition to the United States on an Espionage Act indictment that could have carried a lengthy prison sentence in the event of a conviction. 


The abrupt conclusion enables both sides to claim a degree of victory, with the Justice Department able to resolve without trial a case that raised thorny legal issues and that might never have reached a jury at all given the plodding pace of the extradition process.  


WikiLeaks, the secret-spilling website that Assange founded in 2006, applauded the announcement of the deal, saying it was grateful for "all who stood by us, fought for us, and remained utterly committed in the fight for his freedom." 




The deal, disclosed Monday night in a sparsely detailed Justice Department letter, represents the latest and presumably final chapter in a court fight involving the eccentric Australian computer expert who has been celebrated by supporters as a transparency crusader but lambasted by national security hawks who insist that his disdain for government secrecy put lives at risks, and strayed far beyond the bounds of traditional journalism duties. 


The U.S. Justice Department agreed to hold the hearing on the remote island because Assange opposed coming to the continental U.S. and because it's near Australia, where he will return. 


The guilty plea resolves a criminal case brought by the Trump administration Justice Department in connection with the receipt and publication of war logs and diplomatic cables that detailed U.S. military wrongdoing in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prosecutors alleged that he conspired with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to obtain the records and published them without regard to American national security, including by releasing the names of human sources who provided information to U.S. forces. 


But his activities drew an outpouring of support from press freedom advocates who heralded his role in bringing to light military conduct that might otherwise have been concealed from view. Among the files published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists. 


The indictment was unsealed in 2019, but Assange's legal woes long predated the criminal case and continued well past it. 


Weeks after the release of the largest document cache in 2010, a Swedish prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for Assange based on one woman's allegation of rape and another's allegation of molestation. Assange has long maintained his innocence, and the investigation was later dropped. 


He presented himself in 2012 to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he claimed asylum on the grounds of political persecution, and spent the following seven years in self-exile there, hosting a parade of celebrity visitors and making periodic appearances from the building's balcony to address supporters. 


In 2019, his hosts revoked his asylum, allowing British police to arrest him. He remained locked up for the last five years while the Justice Department sought to extradite him, in a process that encountered skepticism from British judges who worried about how Assange would be treated by the American criminal justice system. 


Ultimately, though, the resolution sparing Assange prison time in the U.S. is a repudiation of sorts of years of ominous warnings by Assange and his supporters that the American criminal justice system would expose him to unduly harsh treatment, including potentially the death penalty — something prosecutors never sought.

## Of Psion and Symbian

date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News

As cool as the organizer was, it was extremely limited in pretty much every way. Psion had got many things right in the first go, as reviewers were quick to admit, and that made iterating on the design somewhat easy. The Organiser II CM released in 1986 was built on the Hitachi HD6303X (Motorola 6803) clocked at 920kHz with 8K RAM and 32K ROM. The screen was a much improved dot matrix LCD with two lines of sixteen characters. This version also shipped with a little piezo beeper built in, and an expansion slot on the top. The expansion slot could allow for a wired power adapter, a serial cable, a bar code reader, a telephone dialer, and even a USB port. Given the reputation of the first model for ruggedness and the coverage of the same quality in the second model, this particular model sold quite well to companies who needed handheld computers for inventory and other purposes. The Organizer II XP launched the same year, and this model had 32K RAM and a backlit screen while otherwise being the same machine. Given that both of these models had significantly more RAM than their predecessor, the programming capabilities were greatly enhanced with a new language, OPL, which was similar to BASIC. ↫ Bradford Morgan White The Psion Organiser II is the very root of all mobile computing today. This may seem like hyperbole &#8211; but trust me, it really is. I have an Organiser II LZ64 with a 32k datapak (memory card), and while it may look like a calculator, this little machine from 1986 already contains the very skeleton of the graphical user interface Palm would eventually popularise, and the iPhone and Android would take to extraordinary heights. Turn on an Organiser II, and you&#8217;re greeted by a home screen with a grid of applications (no icons, though, of course &#8211; just labels) with a selector you moved around with the cursor keys. Hit the EXE key, and the application would load up, ready to be used; hit the home button (the ON key if my memory serves) and it would take you back to the home screen. This basic paradigm, of a grid of applications as a home screen you always return to, survives to this day, and is used by billions of people on their Android and iOS devices, both smartphones and tablets. People with little to no knowledge of the history of mobile computing &#8211; or people spreading corporate propaganda &#8211; often seem to act as if the release of the iPhone was the big bang of mobile computing, and that it materialised out of thin air because Steve Jobs alone willed it into existence. The reality is, though, that there is a direct line from the early Psion devices, through to Palm OS, the iPhone, and later Android. There were various dead end branches along the way, too, like the Newton, like Symbian, like the original Windows PocketPC, and so on &#8211; but that direct line from early Psion to that fancy Pixel 8 Pro or whatever you have today is solidly visible to anyone without an agenda. I love my Organiser II. It&#8217;s approaching 40 years old now, and it still works without a single hitch. There&#8217;s barely a scratch on it, the display is bright, the pixels are clear, the characteristic sliding cover feels as solid today as it did when it rolled off the factory line. This is where mobile computing began.

## Once a rallying cry, 'radical Islamic terrorism' fades from Trump rhetoric

date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — In 2016, Donald Trump's presidential campaign echoed with a frequent vow to crush "radical Islamic terrorism." 


Fast forward to today, as he seeks a second chance in the White House, Trump rarely mentions the phrase, his erstwhile rhetoric about Islamist terrorism eclipsed by a focus on immigration, crime and other domestic issues.  


The shift came into sharp relief on Sunday when a coordinated terrorist assault on a police station, churches and synagogues in southern Russia left at least 20 people dead. What might once have prompted a flurry of tweets went unmentioned on Trump's Truth Social platform.  


Why the silence on what was once a rallying cry? Experts suggest two factors: diminished public concern about terrorism and a possible strategic play for the Muslim American vote. 


Brian Levin, an extremism expert who has closely followed Trump's rhetoric, said the former president — "more of an opportunist than an ideologue" — is zeroing in on issues that resonate with voters.   


"Eight years ago, when the threat of foreign-inspired extremism polled among the top concerns of voters, Trump successfully invoked terror attacks … to drum up support," Levin said. "Today, however, Trump has to pivot somewhat to domestic issues relating to the economy, democracy, crime and the border as well as the record of an incumbent he hopes to unseat." 


Defending his record in office, including his handling of southern border immigration, President Joe Biden has made protecting democracy a centerpiece of his campaign, casting Trump as a grave threat to the country.  


But Biden's staunch support of Israel during its military campaign in Gaza has angered many Muslim voters, opening a rare opportunity for Trump, according to experts.  


Gabriel Rubin, a justice studies professor at Montclair State University, said Trump may be eyeing the Muslim vote in key battleground states with large Muslim populations that could determine the outcome of the November election.   


"He has an avenue not to mention ['radical Islamic terrorism'] too much," Rubin, who has written about Trump's past rhetoric about Muslims and terrorism, told VOA in an interview. "I think he can win some of these Midwestern states if he plays his cards right."  


To be sure, the threat of international terrorism hasn't vanished. In the months since the outbreak of conflict in Gaza, U.S. officials, including FBI Director Christopher Wray, have been sounding the alarm about an increased potential for terrorist attacks.    


But while the warnings seem to have raised the public's worries about terrorism, "overall concern about the issue still doesn't match the higher levels of concern it garnered" in 2015 and 2016, according to an April Gallup report.   


Trump's 2016 campaign rhetoric — from claiming "Muslims hate us" to calling for a "complete and total" shutdown of Muslims entering the country — did not happen in a bubble.  


Though on the run, the Islamic State (IS) still controlled large swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq and advocated attacking the West. Adding to Americans' angst about terrorism were a spate of IS-inspired terror attacks across Europe and the United States. 


In the 12 months leading up to the November election, Trump tweeted 164 times about Islamic State, "radical Islam" and terrorism — nearly twice as much as he did about border security and immigration, according to one estimate. 


Trump's vitriolic comments on Muslims and Islam, welcomed by his supporters, unnerved many in the Muslim community, drawing charges of Islamophobia against him, which he and his allies reject.   


VOA reached out to the Trump campaign for comment but did not receive a response. The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.    




Biden's stance on terrorism, particularly Islamist terrorism, also has evolved over the years. 


While he is not known to have used the phrase "radical Islamic terrorism," in the past he was more willing to employ similar language while taking a tough stance on terrorism.  


In 2014, as vice president under President Barack Obama, he criticized Turkey and the United Arab Emirates for supporting jihadi groups in Syria and "the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts to the world." He later apologized for the comment. 


Since becoming president in 2021, Biden has focused on terrorism more broadly without singling out any one region or religion, moving away from the rhetoric of the "War on Terror" of the 2000s.  


On the day he entered the White House, he repealed the Trump administration's "Muslim ban," calling it "a stain on our national conscience."


In the wake of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, moreover, his administration placed a greater emphasis on domestic terrorism as a significant threat to homeland security. In 2021, it launched the first-ever national strategy for countering domestic terrorism. 


After the October 7 Hamas attack, Biden condemned the attack as "pure, unadulterated evil" while putting a distance between the perpetrators and the broader Muslim community. 


"You know, I know many of you in the Muslim American community or the Arab American community, the Palestinian American community, and so many others are outraged and hurting, saying to yourselves, ‘Here we go again,’ with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11," Biden said on October 10.  


Trump is not known for moderating his rhetoric, even while in office. But after his second year in the White House, the volume of his rhetoric about Muslims and terrorism fell dramatically as he shifted his focus to a new area: border security and illegal immigration. 


That trend has continued into the current campaign. A VOA examination of his most recent social media posts and campaign statements found fewer than 20 references since the start of his reelection campaign, including only one mention of "radical Islamic terrorists." 


That came last July when he announced that he'd reinstate a travel ban on several Muslim countries that he imposed during his first term in office and which Biden later repealed. 


"We don't want people coming into our country that hate us. We want people that love us," he told a rally, citing anti-police riots in France sparked by the killing of a French Moroccan teenager.   


Trump supporters dismiss his rhetoric about Muslims and terrorism as just that — rhetoric.  


"Let's forget about what this guy says. Let's look at what he does," a Muslim Republican activist said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  


Another activist questioned whether Trump has ever said he hates Muslims, adding that more Muslims will likely vote for the former president than did in 2016.  


But if there is one thing both Trump supporters and detractors agree on, it is that Trump will likely follow through on his vow to bring back the "Muslim ban."  


"The legal structure that allowed the Muslim ban to be implemented in the first place is still on the books so we have to start planning as if a new Muslim ban will come into existence," said Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director for the Council on American Islamic Relations.

## The Case for EVs with Gas Tanks

A typical American consumer may want to be able to embark on a summer road-trip across the United States’ vast distances, to cram in a family of five and all their camping supplies (and maybe a dog and a canoe!), or to hitch up a trailer to haul a boat or RV wherever they might want to adventure. </p><p>We may not use all those features most of the time, but we don’t want to make a major purchase like a car, truck, or SUV to meet the average use case; if we can afford to, <em><em>we buy for the edge</em></em> <em><em>case</em></em>.</p><p>That’s why I can’t stop thinking about a recent announcement made by Stellantis, the Euro-American conglomerate behind brands like Dodge, Jeep, Ram and Alfa Romeo. </p><p>For model year 2025, Stellantis will electrify its full-size Ram 1500 pickup, following in the footsteps of GM and Ford. But unlike its rivals, Stellantis will offer the Ram 1500 REV in both an all-electric model (with 350-500 mile range) <em><em>and</em></em> <a href="https://www.ramtrucks.com/electric/ram-1500-ramcharger.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a "range extender" Ramcharger 1500</u></a> that features around 140 miles of electric range — <em><em>plus a V6 engine </em></em>mated to a generator to power the vehicle when the battery is depleted.</p><p>I think it’s brilliant. </p><p>This kind of range-extended EV seems like the ideal near-term product to satisfy some of the trickiest American market segments to electrify: namely the uniquely American demand for full-size pickups and massive SUVs.</p><p><a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-12-q1-ev-sales" target="_self"><u>I’ve been a critic</u></a> of plug-in hybrid vehicles as a bridge to an electrified future in the past. But I’ve leveled that critique against the popular “parallel” plug-in hybrid architecture, which features both a conventional internal combustion engine and mechanical transmission <em><em>plus </em></em>a battery and electric motor/generator. </p><p>Despite Toyota’s reputation for hybrids, Stellantis is actually the undisputed king of plug-in hybrids in the U.S. already, with plug-in hybrid versions of popular models like the Jeep Wrangler and Cherokee and the Chrysler Pacifica minivan <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-12-q1-ev-sales" target="_self"><u>selling at a record pace in recent months</u></a>. </p><p>While this common plug-in hybrid architecture could be right for many Americans reluctant to fully electrify (especially those without access to dedicated Level 2 charging), they suffer from one big drawback: they carry around the full drive train — <em><em>and all the baggage and cost </em></em>— of both a conventional gas-burning vehicle <em><em>and </em></em>a full battery EV. Duplicate drivetrains means they’ll never be cheaper than a pure internal-combustion or electric car. And with limited space on board to cram in a big battery, these vehicles sport <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/mainstream-phevs-with-the-longest-electric-only-range" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a modest 20-40 mile</u></a> all-electric range.</p><p>(Listen to <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-12-q1-ev-sales" target="_self"><u>this recent episode of </u><u><em><em>Shift Key</em></em></u></a><em> </em>for more on my problems with plug-ins and a discussion of recent U.S. electrified vehicle trends)</p><p>In contrast, a “range-extended EV” or “series” plug-in hybrid (or whatever we start calling this other third thing) like the new Ramcharger is a fully electric-drive vehicle. There’s no mechanical transmission to power the wheels. It simply has a compact gasoline engine, tuned to run at a single, most-efficient speed, married to a generator that can produce electricity to run the electric motors when the battery is depleted. </p><p>Thanks to the extended range provided by the gasoline generator, these vehicles can drop battery mass and cost, squeeze in a gasoline engine and fuel tank, and still come out comparable on cost as a pure EV with substantially longer range than parallel plug-in hybrids. </p><p>The Ram 1500 EV needs a massive 229 kilowatt-hour (kWh) pack to deliver an as-advertised 500 mile range. (The 168-kWh battery for the 350-mile-range version is also huge, 85% larger than the pack in my <em><em>extended range</em></em> Mustang Mach-E which gets about 300 miles range.)</p><p>In contrast, the Ramcharger has a 92 kWh pack and offers about 145 miles of all-electric range.</p><p>The range-extended series hybrid thus sheds 137 kWh of batteries vs. the 500 mile range EV. At about $100+ per kWh to manufacture and assemble those incremental battery cells, that saves Stellantis at least $14,000 to manufacture the truck. A new V6 engine costs <a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/automotive/how-much-does-it-cost-to-replace-an-engine.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>about $5,000-10,000 retail</u></a> and surely much less for an automaker to manufacture, so swapping batteries for the V6 nets a significant cost savings.</p><p>The economics and capabilities of a range-extended EV thus make a lot of sense, especially for massive vehicles like the full-size trucks and SUVs so many Americans love. And they squash any concerns about range anxiety that might give buyers pause — especially those interested in towing something, which <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/how-is-ev-driving-range-impacted-by-towing#:~:text=The%20tests%20yielded%20a%20significant,range%20dropped%20to%2090%20miles." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decimates</u></a> the range of the all-electric pickups on the market today.</p><p>At the same time, more range-extended EVs on the road would reduce demand for D.C. fast chargers — which are especially <a href="https://driveelectric.gov/stations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>scarce</u></a> in the more rural areas of America where the full-size pickup is king. You can still charge these vehicles at a D.C. fast charger (if you can find one), but you can also pull into any gas station to extend range on road trips.</p><p>Meanwhile, a 100+ mile electric range is sufficient to cover <a href="https://evstatistics.com/2021/12/99-2-of-us-daily-trips-are-less-than-100-miles/3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>around 99%</u></a> of trips taken in personal vehicle in America. Plus, even when running in generator mode, a series electric drive train with regenerative braking is more efficient than a pure internal combustion drive (especially when the internal combustion generator can bypass the battery to directly power the electric motors, as it can in the Ramcharger). Near-term adoption of range-extended EVs could deliver substantial reductions in both emissions and gas use.</p><p>Sound familiar? That’s because this was exactly how the original Chevy Volt and BMW i3 range extended option were configured way back in 2011. Why GM didn’t continue down this path to electrify their massive Silverados, Sierras, and Escalades is beyond me. </p><p>Stellantis isn’t the only automaker going down this path. Mazda has struggled to get a competitive EV out, with their <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/mazda/mx-30" target="_blank"><u>MX-30 offering a paltry 100-mile range</u></a>. So they’re launching a range-extended version with a compact 830cc rotary engine (one of Mazda’s core IPs), which could turn the compact SUV into a truly viable product. Across the Atlantic, Nissan also <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1141336_nissan-e-power-hybrid-tech-might-evolve-for-us-on-the-way-to-evs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offers a series hybrid drivetrain</u></a> marketed as <a href="https://www.nissan-global.com/EN/INNOVATION/TECHNOLOGY/ARCHIVE/E_POWER/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>e-POWER</u></a> in Europe and the U.K.</p><p>Building range-extended battery EVs is also a good way for manufacturers to develop experience with all-electric vehicle architecture and achieve economies of scale in production. A series hybrid can ride on the same all-electric platform as a full battery electric variant — as in the case of the Ram 1500 REV and Ramcharger — which is key to keeping manufacturing costs low. (Several Chinese automakers took this route.) In contrast, a parallel plug-in hybrid always shares a platform with its pure fossil fueled siblings.</p><p>Finally, the U.S. is embarking on a strategic effort to onshore and “friend shore” the whole EV battery and critical minerals supply chain. It’s going to be a serious challenge. Cutting the size of battery packs in electric full-size pickup and SUVs in half makes that a lot easier.</p><p>So are range-extended EVs with 100 mile range the electrified vehicle Americans are waiting for? If they're demanding big vehicles, towing capacity, and long-distance travel away from cities and interstates — e.g. exactly the segments hardest to satisfy with a pure EV — the answer might be yes. </p><p><em>Editor’s note: A previous version of this article used “personal vehicle miles traveled” instead of trips taken in personal vehicles. It’s been updated. </em></p>

## ‘Sham’ trial of US journalist Gershkovich begins in Russia

date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA

Washington — With his head recently shaven, American journalist Evan Gershkovich appeared briefly in photos taken before his closed-door trial began on Wednesday in Russia, nearly 15 months after he was jailed on espionage charges that are widely viewed as baseless and politically motivated.


A correspondent with The Wall Street Journal, Gershkovich was detained in March 2023 on spying charges that he, his employer and the U.S. government vehemently deny. The State Department has also declared Gershkovich wrongfully detained.


Press freedom experts have said that they expect the trial against Gershkovich to be a politically motivated sham.


“It’s certainly a sham trial. It’s a travesty of justice. The charges brought against him are spurious and unsubstantiated, and the whole thing is just a masquerade,” Gulnoza Said, the Europe and Central Asia program coordinator at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, told VOA.


The trial is taking place in Yekaterinburg, where Gershkovich, 32, was first detained. The Ural Mountains city is about 1,400 kilometers, or 870 miles, east of Moscow.


Russian authorities have accused Gershkovich of “gathering secret information” about a Russian tank manufacturer. But to date, Moscow has not publicly provided any evidence to substantiate the charges against Gershkovich, who was accredited by Russia’s foreign ministry to work in the country.


Russia’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to a VOA email requesting comment.


Secret trials are common practice in Russia for cases of alleged treason or espionage involving classified state material. But that means it will be difficult for observers and watchdogs to monitor the trial, according to Paul Beckett, an assistant editor at The Journal who is leading the newspaper’s campaign to secure Gershkovich’s release.


“I don’t have high hopes that we will be able to see much, if anything, that’s happening there. And I think that just speaks to the opacity of the whole system and its arbitrariness,” Beckett told VOA.


It is not clear how long the trial will take, but based on similar past cases, CPJ’s Said believes it will last a few months. She added that the trial is likely intended to foster a facade of rule of law in Russia.




U.S. embassy officials were present at the courthouse and given brief access before the proceedings began, the diplomatic mission in Moscow said in a statement on Wednesday.


According to the court, the next hearing has been scheduled for August 13, Daniel Kanigan, the spokesperson of the U.S. embassy, told VOA.


Kanigan told VOA on Tuesday that the embassy “will make efforts to attend any future proceedings.”


“Journalism is not a crime. Evan should not have been detained and both he and Paul Whelan should be released,” Kanigan added in the email.


Whelan is a former Marine who is serving a 16-year spying sentence in Russia. The State Department has also declared him wrongfully detained.


If convicted, Gershkovich faces up to 20 years behind bars.


Some press freedom experts believe a conviction — regardless of its illegitimacy — is a necessary yet imperfect step to eventually securing Gershkovich’s release through a prisoner swap.


“They’re trying to kill two birds with one stone. One is to silence Evan,” Said told VOA. “The second goal is, obviously, to get him exchanged for someone who is important for the Kremlin and for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.”


Putin has previously indicated that the Kremlin would be willing to trade Gershkovich for a convicted killer jailed in Germany. Prisoner swap negotiations between Moscow and Washington have been taking place for months.


Although Beckett said a conviction is likely, he added that he hopes the U.S. government can find a way to “short-circuit” the trial process and secure Gershkovich’s release as soon as possible.


“It’s high time that the U.S. government reached a settlement with Russia over how to get Evan, and other Americans wrongfully detained in Russia, back home and back to their families,” said Beckett, who is based in Washington.




In a Wednesday statement, Gershkovich’s family also urged the U.S. government to do everything it can to secure the reporter's release.


“These past 15 months have been extraordinarily painful for Evan and for our family. We miss our son and just want him home,” they said in the statement. “We’re deeply disappointed that he will have to endure further attempts to discredit him and to paint a picture that is unrecognizable to anyone who knows him.”


Gershkovich’s case underscores the poor state of press freedom in Russia, according to media experts. At the end of 2023, the CPJ in New York documented the jailings of 22 journalists in Russia, including 12 foreign nationals.


“The Kremlin has clamped down severely on independent reporting, effectively turning journalism into a crime,” The Journal’s editor-in-chief, Emma Tucker, wrote in a Tuesday open letter on Gershkovich’s trial.


Gershkovich is one of two American journalists currently jailed in Russia.


Alsu Kurmasheva, a U.S.-Russian national who works at VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Prague, has been jailed since October 2023 on charges of failing to self-register as a “foreign agent” and spreading what the Kremlin views as false information about the Russian army.


Kurmasheva, 47, rejects the charges, which carry a combined sentence of 15 years in prison. The U.S. government has also called for her immediate release.

## On Gaza pier, US troops confront waves, destruction and aid backlog

date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA

Trident Pier, off Gaza Coast — Baking under the summer sun, U.S. troops find shelter in containers stationed on what is known as the "parking lot" of a floating pier in the Mediterranean Sea that aims to boost the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip.  


Just over the horizon, destroyed buildings and thick black smoke can be seen rising in the enclave of 2.3 million people, more than eight months into a war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas.


Reuters was given rare access to the pier on Tuesday and saw aid pallets being moved from a vessel onto the 370-meter-long pier as it bobbed around with the incoming waves. The pallets were then taken by trucks to the coast.  


For U.S. Army Sergeant Ibrahim Barry, who is a forklift operator on the pier, the operation is personal. Barry, who is Muslim, was in the U.S. when war broke out and watched as families in Gaza during Ramadan in March and April had no food with which to break their fast.  


"Being in this mission [is] on a personal level for me," he said. "Helping to help them get food ... just taking care of people."


U.S. President Joe Biden announced in March the plan to put the pier in place for aid deliveries as famine loomed in Gaza. As of Tuesday, 8,332 pallets had been delivered via the pier.  


But nearly 6,900 pallets of those have just been sitting on Gaza's coast, in a marshaling area, waiting to be picked up by the United Nations for distribution. The World Food Program paused deliveries earlier this month over security concerns.  


For many troops working on pier operations, this is their first combat zone. But not for Captain Joel Stewart, commander of Naval Beach group 1.


"War is a terrible thing. I don't care where it is. I don't care what it is. It is destruction. It is never pretty. It is certainly not something that I ever want to see again," Stewart said while standing on the pier.  


"The sailors, marines, merchant men, soldiers are all behind this mission because they see they are making a difference for the people of Gaza," Stewart said.  


The pier's usage has been paused multiple times because of sea conditions and at one point was towed to the Israeli port of Ashdod for repairs.  


A senior U.S. official said on Tuesday the pier may be extended well beyond its July 31 authorization date if the United States and aid organizations can get aid flowing again to Palestinians in the coming days and weeks.

## Judge allows Trump to talk about jurors, witnesses in hush money conviction

date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A judge on Tuesday modified Donald Trump's gag order, freeing the former president to comment publicly about witnesses and jurors in the hush money criminal trial that led to his felony conviction but keeping others connected to the case off limits at least until he's sentenced July 11. 


Judge Juan M. Merchan's ruling — just days before Trump's debate Thursday with President Joe Biden — clears the presumptive Republican nominee to again go on the attack against his former lawyer Michael Cohen, adult film actor Stormy Daniels and other witnesses. Trump was convicted May 30 of falsifying records to cover up a potential sex scandal, making him the first ex-president convicted of a crime. 


Trump's lawyers had urged Merchan to lift the gag order completely, arguing there was nothing to justify continued restrictions on Trump's First Amendment rights after the trial's conclusion. Trump has said that the gag order has prevented him from defending himself while Cohen and Daniels continue to pillory him. 


The Manhattan district attorney's office asked Merchan to keep the gag order's ban on comments about jurors, court staffers and the prosecution team in place at least until Trump is sentenced on July 11 but said last week they would be OK with allowing Trump to comment about witnesses now that the trial is over. 


Trump was convicted on 34 counts of falsifying business records arising from what prosecutors said was an attempt to cover up a hush money payment to Daniels just before the 2016 presidential election. She claims she had a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, which he denies. 


The crime is punishable by up to four years behind bars, but prosecutors have not said if they would seek incarceration, and it's unclear if Merchan would impose such a sentence. Other options include a fine or probation. 


Following his conviction, Trump complained that he was under a "nasty gag order" while also testing its limits. In remarks a day after his conviction, Trump referred to Cohen, though not by name, as "a sleazebag." 


In a subsequent Newsmax interview, Trump took issue with jury and its makeup, complaining about Manhattan, "It's a very, very liberal Democrat area so I knew we were in deep trouble," and claiming: "I never saw a glimmer of a smile from the jury. No, this was a venue that was very unfair. A tiny fraction of the people are Republicans." 


Trump's lawyers, who said they were under the impression the gag order would end with a verdict, wrote a letter to Merchan on June 4 asking him to lift the order. 


Prosecutors urged Merchan to keep the gag order's ban on comments about jurors and trial staff in place "at least through the sentencing hearing and the resolution of any post-trial motions." They argued that the judge had "an obligation to protect the integrity of these proceedings and the fair administration of justice." 


Merchan issued Trump's gag order on March 26, a few weeks before the start of the trial, after prosecutors raised concerns about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's propensity to assail people involved in his cases. 


Merchan later expanded it to prohibit comments about his own family after Trump made social media posts attacking the judge's daughter, a Democratic political consultant. The order did not prohibit comments about Merchan or District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office prosecuted the case. 


During the trial, Merchan held Trump in contempt of court, fined him $10,000 for violating the gag order and threatened to put him in jail if he did it again. 


In seeking to lift the gag order, Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove argued that Trump was entitled to "unrestrained campaign advocacy" in light of Biden's public comments about the verdict, and Cohen and Daniels' continued public criticism.

There was a thrusting society then, a society that tried to improve itself. Yes, of course, it cost money. But so what? It allowed people from any kind of background to learn about Shakespeare, or Vermeer.”</p></blockquote><p>A culture where only the rich are afforded the space, training, and platform to make art is missing the voices that make it special. </p><p>The same goes for other spaces: newsrooms where only the wealthy can serve as journalists cannot accurately represent the people who depend on it. Technology without class diversity is myopic. Above all else, a culture of rich people is boring as hell.</p><p>Art school - like all school - should be free and available to everyone.

## Fighting bots is fighting humans

That isn't a great experience for anyone, and I don't think it's sustainable for a publisher in the long run.</p><p>At the same time, I think it's fair to try and prevent some bot access at the moment. Adding AI agents to your robots.txt - although, as recent news has shown, perhaps not as effective a move as it might be - seems like the right call to me.</p><p>Clearly an AI agent isn't a human. For ad hoc queries - where an agent is retrieving content from a website in direct response to a user query - it clearly is acting on <em>behalf</em> of a human. Is it a browser, then? Maybe? If it is, we should just let it through.</p><p>It's accessing articles as training data that I really take issue with (as well as the subterfuge of not always advertising what it is when it accesses a site). In these cases, content is copied into a corpus in a manner that's outside of its licensing, without the author's knowledge. That sucks - not because I'm in favor of DRM, but because often the people whose work is being taken are living on a shoestring, and the software is run by very large corporations who will make a fortune.</p><p>But yes: I don't think auth walls, CAPTCHAs, paywalls, or any added friction between content and audience are a good idea.

## Looking ahead to 30 years of FreeDOS

date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News

In a few days, 29 June, FreeDOS will turn 30. This happens to make it one of the oldest, continuously active open source projects in the world, originally created because Jim Hall had heard Microsoft was going to kill DOS when the upcoming Windows 95 was going to be released. After seeing the excitement around Linux, he decided it an open source DOS would be a valuable time investment. I still used DOS, and I didn’t want to stop using DOS. And I looked at what Linux had achieved: people from all over the world shared source code with each other to make this full operating system that worked just like Unix. And I thought “If they can do that with Linux, surely we can do the same thing with DOS.” I asked around on a discussion board (called Usenet) if anyone had made an “open source” DOS, and people said “No, but that’s a good idea .. and you should do it.” So that’s why I announced on June 29, 1994, that I was starting a new project to make an open source version of DOS that would work just like regular DOS. ↫ Jim Hall For an open source implementation of what was a dead end and now is a dead operating system, FreeDOS has been remarkably successful. Not only are there countless people using FreeDOS on retro hardware, it&#8217;s also a popular operating system for DOS gaming and running old DOS applications in virtual machines. On top of that, many motherboard makers and OEMs use FreeDOS to load firmware update tools, and some of them even offered FreeDOS as the preinstalled operating system when buying new hardware. With the ever-increasing popularity of retrocomputing and gaming, FreeDOS clearly has a bright future ahead of itself.

## Microsoft charged with EU antitrust violations for bundling Teams

date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News

The European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365. ↫ European Commission press release Chalk this one up in the unsurprising column, too. Teams has infested Office, and merely by being bundled it&#8217;s become a major competitor to Slack, even though everyone who has to use it seems to absolutely despise Teams with a shared passion rivaling only Americans&#8217; disgust for US Congress. On a mildly related note, I&#8217;m working with a friend to set up a Matrix server specifically for OSNews users, so we can have a self-hosted, secure, and encrypted space to hang out, continue conversations beyond the shelf life of a news item, suggest interesting stories, point out spelling mistakes, and so on. It&#8217;ll be invite-only at first, with preference given to Patreons, active commenters, and other people I trust. We intend to federate, so if everything goes according to plan, you can use your existing Matrix username and account. I&#8217;ll keep y&#8217;all posted.

## US slaps sanctions on network it accuses of moving billions for Iran's military

date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on nearly 50 entities and people it accused of moving billions of dollars for Iran's military. 


The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said those targeted on Tuesday constitute a "shadow banking network" used by Iran's Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), both of which are under U.S. sanctions. 


The network helped the MODAFL and IRGC — which earn money notably from the sale of oil and petrochemicals — gain access to the international financial system and process the equivalent of billions of dollars since 2020, the Treasury said. 


The Treasury said the revenue generated by the MODAFL and IRGC through networks of Iranian exchange houses and foreign cover companies supported the provision of weapons and funding to Iran's proxy groups, including Yemen's Houthi group, and the transfer of drones to Russia for use in the war against Ukraine. 


Washington has issued rafts of sanctions targeting Iranian drones and the Houthis, who have been launching drone and missile strikes in shipping lanes since November in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's war in Gaza. 


"We continue to work with allies and partners, as well as the global financial industry, to increase vigilance against the movement of funds supporting terrorism," Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in the statement. 


Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately comment on the action. 


Tuesday's action targeted dozens of companies in Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and Marshall Islands, as well as Iran and Turkey-based firms.  


The Treasury said the MODAFL Supply Division uses exchange houses in Iran that manage numerous cover companies registered in jurisdictions such as Hong Kong or the UAE to launder revenue, including from oil sales conducted by Sahara Thunder, which the U.S. imposed sanctions on in April. 


The Treasury at the time accused Sahara Thunder of being a front company that oversees MODAFL's commercial activities in support of the IRGC and Russia's war in Ukraine, playing a key role in Iran's design, development, manufacture and sale of thousands of drones. 


The move freezes the U.S. assets of banned companies and individuals, and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. Those that engage in certain transactions with them also risk being hit with sanctions.

## AP to launch sister organization to fundraise for state, local news

<blockquote><p>"Governed by an independent board of directors, the 501(c)3 charitable organization will help AP sustain, augment and grow journalism and services for the industry, as well as help fund other entities that share a commitment to state and local news."</p></blockquote><p>Fascinating! And much needed.</p><p>I'm curious to learn how this fits into other fundraising efforts, like the <a href="https://www.macfound.org/press/press-releases/press-forward-will-award-more-than-500-million-to-revitalize-local-news">$500M Press Forward initiative for local news</a> that was announced last year.</p><p>I do also have a question about whether all this centralized philanthropy is sustainable. What happens to these newsrooms if the foundation dollars go away? Are they incentivized to find their own business and fundraising models, or does this create a kind of dependence that might be harmful in the long run?</p><p>My hope, of course, is that these efforts are the shot in the arm that journalism needs, and that the newsrooms which receive this funding will be sustainable and enduring. It's certainly lovely to see the support.</p>            <p>[<a href="https://www.ap.org/media-center/press-releases/2024/ap-to-launch-sister-organization-to-fundraise-for-state-local-news/">Link</a>]</p>

## Some polite words regarding the British General Election on July 4

date: 2024-06-25, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p><img src="https://werd.io/file/667ac8fa7d0f8654ad093fc2/thumb.jpg" alt="Apropos of nothing, here's some lettuce" width="1024" height="576"></p><p>On July 4th I’ll be on the beautiful Oregon coast, and I plan to have a bottle of champagne handy. Not so much because of the American Independence Day — although there’s nothing wrong with celebrating that, and I’m sure I will — but because of the British election happening on the same day.</p><p>It’s been a long fourteen years of the worst government imaginable: a Conservative Party that brought about the formidable economic and social own-goal of Brexit, an intellectual blunderbuss to the foot followed by several subsequent very practical blunderbusses to the crotch, followed by a succession of the most ineffectual, rotten-souled Prime Ministers in British history, one of whom famously had less staying power than a literal salad. It was brought into being by a coalition aided by Nick Clegg (who has since made a career of putting a shiny face on terrible things), and then pitifully trumped along in a meandering path fueled by middling opposition, middle-England small-island nationalism, and the distant, smarmy memory of Tony Blair and the Iraq War. (Here I mean lowercase T trump, which means fart, rather than uppercase T Trump, which means Trump.)</p><p>I’m not particularly excited about Keir Starmer’s Labour. It seems to be a sort of 21st century riff on John Major’s Conservative Party of the mid-nineties, presumably in an effort to reach old-school Conservative voters who are sick of the Asda own-brand lunacy of the modern incarnation of their party, knowing that actual left-wing voters have nowhere else to turn. So this isn’t me hoping for major change from him; I expect very little to actually happen. But I am absolutely <em>psyched</em> for the Tories to have their well-heeled posteriors handed to them and their nannies with a fork and knife, finally. It’s been a long time coming.</p><p>If it sounds like it’s personal: yes, it’s personal. I’m a European citizen who grew up in the UK and left for the US to look after a parent, assuming I’d just go back afterwards. It didn’t even occur to me that David Cameron would hold a ham-fisted referendum on European membership, and it didn’t seem to occur to <em>him</em> that he’d lose it and the country would vote to leave. (Ham-fisted, of course, is the way he likes it.) I took it <em>very</em> personally; I <em>still</em> take it very personally; if this post feels like I’m being unusually effluviant, please know that I am holding myself back.</p><p>I’m under no illusions of any major change, even outside of Keir Starmer’s Primark blandness. All these runts will get cushy jobs as chairmen of boards and minty after-dinner speakers. Britain is effed to infinity, and there’s only so much play you can even have within that framework, particularly considering that nobody seems to want to shift the Overton window even slightly leftwards. Heaven forbid you protect the poor and vulnerable and strive to build an inclusive society within a lasting peace. Still, the catharsis of seeing those cordyceps zombie-suits roundly voted away from the nominal seat of power, even if their ilk will continue to be the effective ruling class for evermore, will give me <em>some</em> superficial glee. So, champagne.</p><p>Oh, and I’m excited to see Nigel Farage get his, too.</p><p>Now, back to technology and stuff.</p></div>

The appeals court ruled that the agency’s environmental review failed to assess <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/supreme-court-takes-up-dispute-over-agency-environmental-reviews?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90nTNpLNZ6BXzDr83BTjcS-pBcG0Cw1nw3qD_9SQvNdZNFiNOqwCXCWtb6UL6UfBFFAtTz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how the railway would affect future oil development</a>, along with several other environmental considerations. A group of Utah counties say those impacts are beyond the agency’s obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act.</p><p>
	A decision by the Supreme Court, which is expected to hear arguments in the fall, has the potential to apply not only to railways but also to many other projects regulated by the federal government, including pipelines and shipping ports.</p><h3>2.

A California utility bets big on enhanced geothermal</h3><p>
	The enhanced geothermal startup Fervo, which uses techniques borrowed from fracking oil and gas to access heat below the earth's surface to generate electricity, said today that it had signed the “<a href="https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-announces-320-mw-power-purchase-agreements-with-southern-california-edison/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-90nTNpLNZ6BXzDr83BTjcS-pBcG0Cw1nw3qD_9SQvNdZNFiNOqwCXCWtb6UL6UfBFFAtTz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">world’s largest</a>” geothermal power purchase agreements. The two deals with Southern California Edison, a California utility, add up to 320 megawatts from the company's Utah site. California utilities are mandated by the state energy regulator to buy 1,000 megawatts of non-weather-dependent power with no greenhouse gas emissions, for which geothermal fits the bill. The power will start flowing, Fervo said, by 2026 and will be fully up and running by 2028.

Accounting for damage to timber stocks and watersheds, smoke damage, lost income, and diminished real estate value on top of the property and insurance costs, the report found that fires cost the U.S. as much as $893 billion per year.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Ubuntu 24.10 will default NVIDIA users to Wayland

date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News

The transition to Wayland is nearing completion for most desktop Linux users. The most popular desktop Linux distribution in the world, Ubuntu, has made the call and is switching its NVIDIA users over to Wayland by default in the upcoming release of Ubuntu 24.10. The proprietary NVIDIA graphics driver has been the hold-out on Ubuntu in sticking to the GNOME X.Org session out-of-the-box rather than Wayland as has been the default for the past several releases when using other GPUs/drivers. But for Ubuntu 24.10, the plan is to cross that threshold for NVIDIA now that their official driver has much better Wayland support and has matured into great shape. Particularly with the upcoming NVIDIA R555 driver reaching stable very soon, the Wayland support is in great shape with features like explicit sync ready to use. ↫ Michael Larabel This is great news for the Linux desktop, as having such a popular Linux distribution defaulting the users of the most popular graphics card brand to X.org created a major holdout. None of this obviously means that Wayland is perfect or that all use cases are covered &#8211; accessibility is an important use case where tooling simply hasn&#8217;t been optimised yet for Wayland, but work is underway &#8211; and for those of us who prefer X.org for a variety of reasons, there are still countless distributions offering it as a fallback or as the default option.

## Microsoft puts repair front and center

date: 2024-06-25, from: OS News

It seems the success of the Framework laptops, as well the community&#8217;s relentless focus on demanding repairable devices and he ensuing legislation, are starting to have an impact. It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that Microsoft&#8217;s Surface devices were effectively impossible to repair, but with the brand new Snapdragon X Elite and Pro devices, the company has made an impressive U-turn, according to iFixIt. Both the new Surface Laptop and Surface Pro are exceptionally easy to repair, and take cues from Framework&#8217;s hardware. Microsoft’s journey from the unrepairable Surface Laptop to the highly repairable devices on our teardown table should drive home the importance of designing for repair. The ability to create a repairable Surface was always there but the impetus to design for repairable was missing. I’ll take that as a sign that Right to Repair advocacy and legislation has begun to bear fruit. ↫ Shahram Mokhtari The new Surface devices contain several affordances to make opening them up and repairing them easier. They take cues from Framework in that inside screws and components are clearly labeled to indicate what type they are and which parts they&#8217;re holding in place, and there&#8217;s a QR code that leads to online repair guides, which were available right away, instead of having to wait months to forever for those to become accessible. The components are also not layered; in other words,you don&#8217;t need to remove six components just to get to the SSD, or whatever &#8211; some laptops require you to take out the entire mainboard just to get access to the fans to clean them, which is bananas. Microsoft technically doesn&#8217;t have to do any of this, so it&#8217;s definitely praiseworthy that their hardware department is going the extra kilometre to make this happen. The fact that even the Surface Pro, a tablet, can be reasonably opened up and repaired is especially welcome, since tablets are notoriously difficult to impossible to repair.

## US and allies clash with Tehran, Moscow at UN Security Council

date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA

UNITED NATIONS — The United States and its key European allies clashed with Iran and Russia over Tehran’s expanding nuclear program, with the U.S. vowing “to use all means necessary to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran” in a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday.


The U.S., France, Britain and Germany accused Iran of escalating its nuclear activities far beyond limits it agreed to in a 2015 deal aimed at preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons, and of failing to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.


Iran and Russia accused the U.S. and its allies of continuing to apply economic sanctions that were supposed to be lifted under the deal and insisted that Tehran’s nuclear program remains under constant oversight by the IAEA.


The clashes came at a semi-annual meeting on implementation of the nuclear deal between Iran and six major countries — the U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany — known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.


Under the accord, Tehran agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for the peaceful use of nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.


Then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the deal in 2018. Trump said he would negotiate a stronger deal, but that didn’t happen.


The council meeting followed an IAEA report in late May that Iran has more than 142 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 60% purity, a technical step away from weapons-grade level of 90%. The IAEA said this was an increase of over 20 kilograms from February.


The IAEA also reported on June 13 that its inspectors verified that Iran has started up new cascades of advanced centrifuges more quickly enrich uranium and planned to install more.


U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told the council that the IAEA reports “show that Iran is determined to expand its nuclear program in ways that have no credible civilian purpose.”


Wood said the U.S. is prepared to use all means to prevent a nuclear-armed Iran, but said it remains "fully committed to resolving international concerns surrounding Iran’s nuclear program through diplomacy.”


The three Western countries that remain in the JCPOA — France, Germany and the United Kingdom — issued a joint statement after the council meeting also leaving the door open for diplomatic efforts “that ensure Iran never develops a nuclear weapon.”


They said Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium is now 30 times the JCPOA limit and stressed that Iran committed not to install or operate any centrifuges for enrichment under the JCPOA.


Their joint statement also noted that “Iranian officials have issued statements about its capacity to assemble a nuclear weapon.”


Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani blamed “the unilateral and unlawful U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA” and the failure of the three European parties to the deal “to honor their commitments,” saying it is “crystal clear” they are responsible for the current non-functioning of the agreement.


In the face of U.S. and European sanctions, he said, Iran has the right to halt its commitments under the JCPOA.


Iravani reiterated Iran’s rejection of nuclear weapons, and insisted its nuclear activities including enrichment are “for peaceful purposes” and are subject to “robust verification and monitoring” by the IAEA.


The Iranian ambassador strongly endorsed the JCPOA, calling it a hard-won diplomatic achievement “that effectively averted an undue crisis.”


“It remains the best option, has no alternative, and its revival is indeed in the interest of all of its participants,” he said. “Our remedial measures are reversible if all sanctions are lifted fully and verifiably."


But France, Germany and the UK said some of Iran’s nuclear advances are irreversible.


Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said U.S. promises “to abandon the policy of maximum pressure on Tehran and to return to the nuclear deal remained empty words.”


He accused some other JCPOA parties, which he didn’t name, of “doing everything possible to continuously rock the boat, jettisoning opportunities for the implementation of the nuclear deal.”


Nebenzia urged the European parties to the agreement and the United States to return to the negotiating table in Vienna and “demonstrate their commitment to the objective of restoration of the nuclear deal.”


EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, the coordinator of the JCPOA, said the compromise text he put forward two years ago for the U.S. to return to the JCPOA and for Iran to resume full implementation of the agreement remains on the table.

## A look at Julian Assange and how the long-jailed WikiLeaks founder is now on the verge of freedom

date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — News that the U.S. Justice Department has reached a plea deal that will lead to freedom for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange brings a stunning culmination to a long-running saga of international intrigue that spanned multiple continents. Its central character is a quixotic internet publisher with a profound disdain for government secrets.


A look at Assange, the case and the latest developments:


Who is Julian Assange?


An Australian editor and publisher, he is best known for having founded the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, which gained massive attention — and notoriety — for the 2010 release of almost half a million documents relating to the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.


His activism made him a cause célèbre among press freedom advocates who said his work in exposing U.S. military misconduct in foreign countries made his activities indistinguishable from what traditional journalists are expected to do as part of their jobs.


But those same actions put him in the crosshairs of American prosecutors, who released an indictment in 2019 that accused Assange — holed up at the time in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London — of conspiring with an Army private to illegally obtain and publish sensitive government records.


“Julian Assange is no journalist,” John Demers, the then-top Justice Department national security official, said at the time. “No responsible actor, journalist or otherwise, would purposely publish the names of individuals he or she knew to be confidential human sources in war zones, exposing them to the gravest of dangers.”


What is he accused of?


The Trump administration’s Justice Department accused Assange of directing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in one of the largest compromises of classified information in U.S. history.


The charges relate to WikiLeaks’ publication of thousands of leaked military and diplomatic documents, with prosecutors accusing Assange of helping Manning steal classified diplomatic cables that they say endangered national security and of conspiring together to crack a Defense Department password.


Reports from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq published by Assange included the names of Afghans and Iraqis who provided information to American and coalition forces, prosecutors said, while the diplomatic cables he released exposed journalists, religious leaders, human rights advocates and dissidents in repressive countries.


Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison after being convicted of violating the Espionage Act and other offenses for leaking classified government and military documents to WikiLeaks. President Barack Obama commuted her sentence in 2017, allowing her release after about seven years behind bars.


Why wasn't he already in U.S. custody?


Assange has spent the last five years in a British high-security prison, fighting to avoid extradition to the U.S. and winning favorable court rulings that have delayed any transfer across the Atlantic.


He was evicted in April 2019 from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he had sought refuge seven years earlier amid an investigation by Swedish authorities into claims of sexual misconduct that he has long denied and that was later dropped. The South American nation revoked the political asylum following the charges by the U.S. government.


Despite his arrest and imprisonment by British authorities, extradition efforts by the U.S. had stalled prior to the plea deal.


A U.K. judge in 2021 rejected the U.S. extradition request in 2021 on the grounds that Assange was likely to kill himself if held under harsh U.S. prison conditions. Higher courts overturned that decision after getting assurances from the U.S. about his treatment. The British government signed an extradition order in June 2022.


Then, last month, two High Court judges ruled that Assange can mount a new appeal based on arguments about whether he will receive free-speech protections or be at a disadvantage because he is not a U.S. citizen. The date of the hearing has yet to be determined.


What will the deal require?


Assange will have to plead guilty to a felony charge under the Espionage Act of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and disseminate classified information relating to the national defense of the United States, according to a Justice Department letter filed in federal court.


Rather than face the prospect of prison time in the U.S., he is expected to return to Australia after his plea and sentencing. Those proceedings are scheduled for Wednesday morning, local time in Saipan, the largest island in the Northern Mariana Islands.


The hearing is taking place there because of Assange’s opposition to traveling to the continental U.S. and the court’s proximity to Australia.


On Monday evening, he left a British prison ahead of a court hearing expected to result in his release.


Is this case connected to the 2016 election?


It's not, but beyond his interactions with Manning, Assange is well-known for the role WikiLeaks played in the 2016 presidential election, when it released a massive tranche of Democratic emails that federal prosecutors say were stolen by Russian intelligence operatives.


The goal, officials have said, was to harm the electoral effort of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and boost her Republican challenger Donald Trump, who famously said during the campaign: “WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks.”


Assange was not charged as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. But the investigation nonetheless painted an unflattering role of WikiLeaks in advancing what prosecutors say was a brazen campaign of Russian election interference.


Assange denied in a Fox News interview that aired in January 2017 that Russians were the source of the hacked emails, though those denials are challenged by a 2018 indictment by Mueller of 12 Russian military intelligence officers.

## Law enforcement is spying on thousands of Americans’ mail, records show

## WikiLeaks’ Assange lands in Saipan before guilty plea in deal with US securing his freedom

date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA

SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has arrived in Saipan ahead of an expected guilty plea in a deal with the U.S. Justice Department that will set him free to return home to Australia.


The plane carrying the eccentric computer expert and internet publisher touched down more than two hours before the scheduled start of a plea hearing, in which he is set to admit to a felony for publishing U.S. military secrets under a deal that spares him prison time in America after years spent jailed in the United Kingdom while fighting extradition to America.


The hearing, taking place in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. commonwealth in the Pacific, is the stunning culmination of the U.S. government's yearslong pursuit of the publisher who has been painted both as a hero and a reckless criminal for exposing hundreds of thousands of sensitive military documents.


 




The U.S. Justice Department agreed to hold the hearing on the remote island because Assange opposed coming to the continental U.S. and because it's near Australia, where he will return after he enters his plea.


The deal — disclosed Monday night in court papers — represents the final chapter in a more than decade-long legal odyssey over the fate of Assange, whose hugely popular secret-sharing website made him a cause célèbre among press freedom advocates who said he acted as a journalist to expose U.S. military wrongdoing. U.S. prosecutors have said his actions recklessly put the country's national security at risk.


Though the deal with prosecutors requires Assange to admit guilt to a single felony count, it also allows him to avoid spending any time in an American prison. He will get credit for the five years he has already spent in a high-security British prison while fighting extradition to the U.S. to face charges. Before being locked up in London, Assange spent years hiding out in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden to face allegations of rape and sexual assault, which he has denied.


 




The abrupt conclusion enables both sides to claim a degree of success, with the Justice Department able to resolve without trial a case that raised thorny legal issues and that might never have reached a jury at all given the plodding pace of the extradition process.


Last month, Assange won the right to appeal an extradition order after his lawyers argued that the U.S. government provided “blatantly inadequate” assurances that he would have the same free speech protections as an American citizen if extradited from Britain.


His wife, Stella Assange, told the BBC from Australia that it had been “touch and go” over 72 hours whether the deal would go ahead but she felt “elated” at the news. A lawyer who married the WikiLeaks founder in prison in 2022, she said details of the agreement would be made public once the judge had signed off on it.


“He will be a free man once it is signed off by a judge,” she said, adding that she still didn't think it was real.


Assange on Monday left the London prison, where he has spent the last five years, after being granted bail during a secret hearing last week. He boarded a plane that landed hours later in Bangkok to refuel before taking off again toward Saipan. A video posted by WikiLeaks on X, showed Assange staring intently out the window at the blue sky as the plane headed toward the island.


 




“Imagine. From over 5 years in a small cell in a maximum security prison. Nearly 14 years detained in the UK. To this,” WikiLeaks wrote. The top Australian diplomat in the United Kingdom accompanied Assange on the flight.


The guilty plea resolves a criminal case brought by Republican President Donald Trump's administration over the receipt and publication of war logs and diplomatic cables that detailed U.S. military action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prosecutors alleged that Assange conspired with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to obtain the records and published them without regard to American national security, including by releasing the names of human sources who provided information to U.S. forces.


Former Vice President Mike Pence called the new arrangement a “miscarriage of justice," writing on X that Assange "endangered the lives of our troops in a time of war and should have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."


But Assange's activities drew an outpouring of support from press freedom advocates, who heralded his role in bringing to light military conduct that might otherwise have been concealed from view. Among the files published by WikiLeaks was a video of a 2007 Apache helicopter attack by American forces in Baghdad that killed 11 people, including two Reuters journalists.


 




Australia for years has been calling on the U.S. government to drop the case against Assange, arguing there's a disconnect between the treatment of Assange and Manning. Then-U.S. President Barack Obama commuted Manning’s 35-year sentence to seven years, which allowed her release in 2017.


“Regardless of the views that people have about Mr. Assange’s activities, the case has dragged on for too long,” said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. “There’s nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia.”


Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 and was granted political asylum after courts in England ruled he should be extradited to Sweden as part of a rape investigation in the Scandinavian country. He was arrested by British police after Ecuador’s government withdrew his asylum status in 2019 and then jailed for skipping bail when he first took shelter inside the embassy.


Although Sweden eventually dropped its sex crimes investigation because so much time had elapsed, Assange had remained in London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison during the extradition fight with the U.S.


Assange made headlines again in 2016 after his website published Democratic emails that prosecutors say were stolen by Russian intelligence operatives. He was never charged in special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, but the inquiry laid bare in stark detail the role that the hacking operation played in interfering in that year’s election on behalf of Trump.

## US expected to announce $150M in new military aid for Ukraine

date: 2024-06-25, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — The U.S. is expected to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine valued at up to $150 million as soon as Tuesday, two U.S. officials tell VOA.


The package is being provided to Kyiv under the presidential drawdown authority (PDA), which pulls weapons, ammunition and equipment from U.S. military stockpiles to fulfill Ukraine’s short-term needs. 


One of the officials — who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the package ahead of its planned announcement — said the latest round of aid would include munitions for HIMARS and other critical munitions. It does not include cluster munitions, according to the official.


Asked whether the aid package includes long-range missiles known as ATACMS, the official replied, “For operational security reasons, we aren’t going into further details.”


ATACMS have a range of up to 300 kilometers (about 185 miles) and nearly double the striking distance of Ukraine’s missiles. 


When asked by VOA on June 12 if the United States had provided Ukraine with more ATACMS since mid-March, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General C.Q. Brown said, "We're working through the ATACMS piece, and we continue to provide that capability through our PDAs." 


Russia has accused Ukraine of using some of the U.S.-provided ATACMS in deadly strikes this week inside Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, and in Russia’s Belgorod region bordering Ukraine.


Russia summoned the U.S. ambassador in Moscow on Monday to protest the use of the missiles.


This week’s aid package for Kyiv will dip into the $61 billion in Ukraine funding signed into law by President Joe Biden in April.
