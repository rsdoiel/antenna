<h2 id="menuetos-gets-basic-x-server">MenuetOS gets basic X server</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>There’s been a few new releases since the last time we talked about
MenuetOS, back in March of this year when version 1.50.00 was released,
so I figured it was time to take a look at what the project’s been up
to. And just in case you don’t remember – MenuetOS is 64 bit operating
system written in assembly that fits on a single 1.44 MB floppy disk.
There’s also a 32 bit version that’s no longer being developed – I
think. Weirdly enough, the 1.50.00 released is no longer listed, but
recent changes include Mplayer being part of the disk image, further
updates to the included X-Window Server, the usual bugfixes, and a few
more things. The X server is quite cool – with it, you can run, say,
Firefox on your Linux installation, but have the MenuetOS X server
render the UI. In addition, thanks to MenuetOS now including a basic
POSIX layer, it’s possible to create basic applications that run
unmodified on both MenuetOS and a Linux distribution like Ubuntu.
Neat.</p>

id="floods-from-thunderstorms-lead-to-dramatic-rescues-and-2-deaths-in-connecticut">Floods
from thunderstorms lead to dramatic rescues and 2 deaths in
Connecticut</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>oxford, connecticut — Torrential rains turned streets into raging
rivers in parts of Connecticut and New York’s Long Island, trapping
people in cars and a restaurant, covering vehicles in mud, and sweeping
two women to their deaths, authorities said.</p>
<p>Dramatic rescues unfolded as a foot (30 centimeters) of rain fell on
some parts of western Connecticut late Sunday and early Monday, coming
down so fast that it caught drivers unaware. Connecticut Governor Ned
Lamont said more than 100 people were evacuated by search and rescue
teams Sunday evening.</p>
<p>The bodies of two women who had been in separate cars were recovered
Monday in Oxford, a town of 13,000 about 35 miles southwest of Hartford,
officials said. Both were Oxford residents.</p>
<p>Firefighters were trying to get the first woman to safety when the
flooded Little River swept her away, Oxford Fire Chief Scott Pelletier
said at a news conference with other Connecticut officials. The second
woman got out of her car and tried to cling to a sign, but “the racing
water was too much” and swept her away, too, he said.</p>
<p>“This is a tragic and devastating day for Oxford,” the town’s first
selectman, George Temple, said.</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal added, “Who would have thought the
Little River would turn into a gushing torrent of destruction, which is
what happened.”</p>
<p>In nearby Southbury, Lucas Barber used wilderness first responder
techniques he learned as a backpacker and rock climber to wade through
chest-high water to save Patrick Jennings, who has a prosthetic leg, and
Jennings’ dog from a car outside the Southbury Plaza mall.</p>
<p>Barber, 30, said he drove to higher ground and grabbed rope he keeps
in his car for emergencies. Jennings’ car, he said, looked like it was
“turning in the tide and seemed to be sinking.”</p>
<p>Barber said he first tried to throw his rope to Jennings but changed
his approach when he was told Jennings had a prosthetic leg. Barber
waded and swam to the car, which was filling with water, he said.</p>
<p>He saw Jennings’ golden retriever, Stanley, in the back, scared, and
Jennings worried about leaving him behind.</p>
<p>“‘Your dog is coming with us, but also I need to get you out right
now,’” Barber said he told Jennings.</p>
<p>Jennings took off his prosthetic leg, and Barber wrapped his rope
around the man’s waist and chest. Barber tried tying the rope around the
dog’s collar, but it came undone. Once he got Jennings to safety and
others could tend to him, he went back for Stanley. Halfway back, Barber
said, the dog got excited to see Jennings and swam the rest of the way
to his owner.</p>
<p>Barber said he went back a third time to fetch Jennings’ prosthetic
leg, which was bobbing next to his car.</p>
<p>In Oxford, rushing waters surrounded the Brookside Inn, trapping 18
people. Firefighters had to stretch a ladder across the floodwaters to
reach them as cars and other large debris carried by the torrent smashed
into the building, said Jeremy Rodorigo, a firefighter from neighboring
Beacon Falls.</p>
<p>The storm system that hit Connecticut and then moved on to Long
Island was separate from Hurricane Ernesto, which on Monday was over the
open Atlantic Ocean but still expected to cause powerful swells,
dangerous surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>
<p>William Syrett, a professor of meteorology and atmospheric science at
Penn State University, referred to the Connecticut-New York system as
“training thunderstorms.”</p>
<p>“It’s like each thunderstorm is a car on a train track, and so they
just keep going over the same place,” he said. He cited “perfect
conditions” for the storms, thanks to the amount of moisture in the air
and a slow weather system.</p>
<p>The unusual part was the amount of rain that fell over several hours,
Syrett said, not the thunderstorms themselves.</p>
<p>Ed Romaine, the executive of Long Island’s Suffolk County, said that
hundreds of homes were affected by flooding and that mudslides covered
the roofs of cars in some areas.</p>
<p>The storms canceled more than 450 flights at Newark Liberty,
LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy airports, officials said.</p>

id="parents-rage-against-new-fee-to-keep-their-smart-bassinets-smart">Parents
rage against new fee to keep their smart bassinets smart</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: OS News</p>
<p>But last month, that hand-me-down network was dealt a blow when
Happiest Baby, the company that makes Snoo, began charging for access to
some of the bassinet’s premium features — features that used to be
available to Snoo users indefinitely, at no extra cost. Now, access to
the app needed to lock in the bassinet’s rocking level, to track the
baby’s sleep and to use the so-called weaning mode, among other
features, will cost parents $20 a month. The change has angered
secondhand users and original buyers alike. On Reddit, the new
subscription model has prompted review bombs, group brainstorms for
collective action and detailed instructions for outraged parents seeking
recourse. Some have taken to filing complaints with the Federal Trade
Commission, Better Business Bureau and state-run consumer protection
offices. ↫ Sandra E. Garcia and Rachel Sherman at The New York Times My
wife had our first baby a little over three years ago, and our second
one a little over a year ago, and let me tell you – the amount of
“smart” and “connected” stuff they sell targeted at babies and young
parents is insane. The only “smart” thing we got was a camera that pipes
sound to my phone and detects movement, and sends a notification to our
phone so we can take a peek and see if everything’s alright. Our oldest
has outgrown it, and our youngest doesn’t really need it, so it’s just
being useless at the moment, fitted to the wall. It definitely improved
our nights, though, since it made sure we would never have to get up for
no reason. Other than that, we are very analog. I had heard of “smart”
bassinets, but we didn’t think we needed one. That’s just our decision,
though, and you can rightfully argue that using a camera and open
microphone is not that different. All of these new “smart” tools are
just that, tools, and can be useful and make your life just a little bit
easier, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. Being a parent
of a newborn is hard enough as it is without outsiders judging you and
pressuring you into doing things you don’t think are right, especially
since you know your own newborn – and yourself – better than some random
outsiders do. The Snoo is one of the more popular smart bassinets,
apparently, and at an entry price of 1700 dollars it’s bonkers
expensive. The thing is, though, as a new parent you know a lot of the
stuff you buy has a relatively limited shelf life – they grow so fast –
so you kind of take into account that you’ll be selling some of the more
expensive stuff down the line to recoup some of the costs. We have an
insanely expensive stroller from a Norwegian brand, because it needed to
be able to handle the Arctic climate and its endless snow, including
specialised wheels and tires for trudging through the snow. The resale
value of these is quite decent, so we know we’ll get a decent part of
the initial cost back, especially since we take extremely good care of
it. And this is where the company that makes the Snoo, Happiest Baby,
decided to screw over its customers. The company clearly realised the
theoretical loss of revenue from the used market, and came up with this
subscription model to lock in some of that theoretical revenue. However,
since Happiest Baby always promised all of its features would work
perpetually, this came as a huge shock to both buyers of used Snoo
bassinets, as well as to parents intending to sell their Snoo, who now
see their resale value plummet. The reasoning behind the sudden
subscription model given by the company is absolutely wild. Harvey Karp,
the founder and chief executive of Happiest Baby, defended the move as a
business necessity. “We don’t have any dollar from the government, we
don’t have a dollar from a university,” said Dr. Karp, a former
pediatrician who created the Snoo after becoming frustrated with the
lack of progress in reducing rates of sudden infant death syndrome, or
SIDS. “We have to sell products and bring in revenue to be able to get
to this goal.” That goal, according to Dr. Karp, is “that everyone will
have access to this, and it will be paid for not by your friend, but it
will be paid for by your corporation, the government or your insurance
company,” the way breast pumps are often covered. He also pointed to
Happiest Baby’s efforts to make the Snoo available “in the inner city
and in rural areas.” For many parents, however, paying into that ideal
is of little comfort to their bottom line. ↫ Sandra E. Garcia and Rachel
Sherman at The New York Times He’s basically stating that because he
doesn’t get free money from the government, universities, customers’
employers, or insurance companies, he can’t make any profit off the Snoo
products. He’s arguing that a $1700 bassinet with some sensors and chips
is not a profitable product, which sounds absolutely like a flat-out lie
to me. If he really can’t make a profit with such a price for such a
product, there’s clearly something else wrong with the way the company
is spending its money. Anyone who has ever watched Last Week Tonight
with Jon Oliver knows just how many healthcare-related markets and
businesses in the United States rely almost exclusively on government
money through programs like Medicare and Medicaid, leading to an insane
amount of scams and wasted money because there aren’t even remotely
enough inspectors and related personnel to ensure such money is
effectively spent, made worse by the fact such tasks are delegated to
the states. This whole Snoo thing almost make me think Karp intended to
profit off these often nebulous government money streams, but somehow
failed to do so. I feel for the parents, though. They bought a product
that didn’t include a hint of a subscription or paywalled features, and
now they have</p>

<h2 id="something-new-intrigue">2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1 id="2024-08-19-something-new-intrigue">
2024-08-19 Something new: intrigue
</h1>
<p>
A while ago,
<a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="enfors">@enfors</span></a> said he wanted
his sandbox generator supplement to have something special. I wasn’t
exactly sure what he was thinking of, but I started thinking about the
things that I feel are under-explored.
</p>
<p>
A while ago, for example, I wondered: What would be the simplest game
that emphasises how many friends you make, that rewards the size of the
community you build? Back in 2016 I wrote a game called
<a href="2016-08-19_Romantic_Fantasy">Best Friends</a> that I never
used. It was <a href="2019-10-10_Non-adventure_games%3F">still an
adventure game</a>. Basically, replace your “level” with the number of
friends you have. Something like that.
</p>
<p>
But that still doesn’t get into really new territory. Something I would
like to see is a system for how to run an intrigue as a party –
including everybody at the table, for all the classes and skill
profiles. I feel that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> attempted to do
this but the result wasn’t great, at least at my table.
</p>
<p>
Quoting my past self:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I’m also not too happy with A Song of Ice and Fire. We’ve only played
three times, so I’m willing to give it more time. When I ran one of the
sessions I basically split the party to the max since since all
characters are so diverse. There is no D&amp;D like party and that also
requires me to rethink my adventure design. –
<a href="2010-04-08_Spring">2010-04-08 Spring</a>
</p>
<p>
I can always switch into a movie director stance, go around the table,
point at players, “now you!” and after a bit when the exchange happened
and a die was maybe cast, “as we wait for that, we cut to…” and soon
enough “in the mean time…” – and I do this aggressively, in small time
slots. This results in a somewhat military style of pointing at people
to let them know that now is their turn, while simultaneously waving at
others to hold their thoughts, or maybe cutting talkative players off
when they’re running too long. It’s weird, but when there’s a lot of
players, or when there’s no party play to return to, it works well
enough. We’ve made these kinds of mistakes in games where there are
characters that are well suited for fighting and others that are not,
with their players trying to solve problems by fighting, and players do
not. This happened to me when I ran a one-shot of <em>A Song of Ice and
Fire</em>. It worked for a session, but it was exhausting and I don’t
want to claim that it’s a good solution. It was simply a short term
solution that worked, for me. Next time, however, make sure players
create characters that will adventure together. –
<a href="2021-02-27_Cohesion">2021-02-27 Cohesion</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Perhaps the split into combat and intrigue that the game introduced
wasn’t good game design because it made sense from the perspective of
emulating the books but it didn’t make sense from the perspective of
some people wanting to play a game together. Or maybe it just didn’t fit
my expectations of what it means to play together. Or maybe we just
missed the implied recommendation to focus on either combat or intrigue
and everybody having two characters, one for each domain. Or maybe just
run either a combat campaign or an intrigue campaign.
</p>
<p>
So what I’m looking for is for a way to get intrigue results, using
procedures like we do for combat or exploration, for dungeons or the
wilderness. The goal is to bring about a change in leadership of a town,
a gang, a castle, an army unit, or to succeed in an act of sabotage, to
incite a rebellion – things that are either hand-waved or the party is
hired for the dirty work while the non-player characters are the
politicians and rabble-rousers. I know this can work. It’s OK for the
party to do the dirty work, to assassinate a tyrant and the non-player
characters then taking the throne and similar things, but I want to go
further. I want to involve all the players at the table. I want the
players to think about the logistics of war, the organising and
preparations of revolutions, the intricacies of marriage politics.
</p>
<p>
What if B/X D&amp;D went levels 1–3 is for dungeons, 4–6 is for the
wilderness and 7–9 is <em>for politics</em>. Doesn’t that sound
fantastic? What sort of rules would you find in that third book? You
would not get to name level by being a colonizer and clearing the land
but by taking over an existing position of power – through intrigue.
Oust the abbot, kick out the bishop, marry into the baron’s family, take
over the guild. With the help of your friends. Without resorting to
combat, but with dice rolling.
</p>
<p>
Not something like Burning Wheel’s Duel of Wits but something like
social combat for Fate games, like the <a href="social-combat">social
combat system in Diaspora</a>, for example.
</p>
<p>
I still feel this space is not well served.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23RPG">#RPG</a>

<strong>2024-08-19</strong>.
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@bradjmurray" title="@bradjmurray@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="bradjmurray">@bradjmurray</span></a>’s most
recent take on those rules:

combat in diaspora</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-20</strong>. I find that urban adventures suffer from
the same problem. If it’s just two or three buildings and those act like
dungeons, my games work. If it’s just social encounters that can be
resolved with reaction rolls, my games work. But everything else in an
urban environment seems to be politics, to me. And I have no good
procedures to resolve those. So if anybody reading this is thinking
about writing a blog post on the topic, I’d love to read it.

<p class="drop-caps">
If Vice President Kamala Harris is elected president in November — as is
looking
<a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/where-harris-has-improved-the-most?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>increasingly
likely</u></a> — her term will last until the beginning of 2029. At that
point, we’ll have a much better idea whether the planet is on track to
hit the 1.5 degrees Celsius
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/warming-carbon-climate-change-too-late-943b4b34bff5110631c2e02f5cdf7d68" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
threshold</u></a> that some expect it to cross that year; we’ll
<em><em>also</em></em> know whether the United States is likely to meet
the first goal of the Inflation Reduction Act: to reduce national
greenhouse gas emissions to half of 2005 levels
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/climate/#:~:text=As%20part%20of%20that%20vision,pollution%2Dfree%20electricity%20by%202035" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
2030</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
There is
<a href="https://x.com/TreyPollardVA/status/1823703292934791328" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
lot riding on the outcome of the 2024 election</u></a>, then. But even
more to the point, there is a lot riding on how, and how aggressively,
Harris extends President Biden’s climate policies. Last week, I spoke to
nine different climate policy experts about what’s on their wishlists
for a potential Harris-Walz administration and encountered resounding
excitement about the opportunities ahead. I also encountered nine
different opinions on how, exactly, Harris should capitalize on those
opportunities, should she wind up in the White House come January.
</p>
<p>
That said, the ideas I heard largely coalesced into three main avenues
of approach: The first would see Harris use her position to shore up the
country’s existing climate policies, doubling down on spending and
addressing loopholes in the IRA. A second path would involve
aggressively expanding on Biden’s legacy, mainly through major new
investments. The final and most ambitious path would involve Harris
approaching climate change and the energy transition with an original
and bold vision for the years ahead (though your priorities may vary).
</p>
<p>
The policy proposals that fall under these loosely organized paths
aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive, and, as you’ll see, some of the
advocate’s proposals fall into multiple categories. But it’s also true
that by making <em><em>everything </em></em>a priority, nothing is. With
that in mind, here are three approaches climate insiders say Harris
could take if she wins the White House in November.
</p>
<h3>
Harris should finish the job Biden started
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Continue building on what has already been accomplished
</li>
<li>
Ensure permitting reform gets across the line
</li>
<li>
Address existing regulatory uncertainties
</li>
<li>
Make sure policies like the Justice 40 Initiative are working the way
they’re supposed to
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Before jumping headlong into expanding the country’s climate policies,
the Harris administration could start by shoring up
<em><em>existing</em></em> legislation — mainly, the loopholes and
oversights in the Inflation Reduction Act. “The IRA was the biggest
climate investment in history and fundamentally changed the emissions
trajectory of the U.S — but the work is not done,” Adrian Deveny,
founder of the decarbonization strategy group
<a href="https://climatevision.us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Climate
Vision</u></a> who previously worked on the IRA as Senate Majority
Leader Chuck Schumer’s director of energy and environmental policy, told
me.
</p>
<p>
As things stand, the policies in the IRA alone
<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Modeling-the-Inflation-Reduction-Act-with-the-US-Energy-Policy-Simulator_August.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>won’t
be enough</u></a> to meet President Biden’s goal of halving the nation’s
greenhouse gas emissions by 2030; to do that, the U.S. would “need to
pass another IRA-sized bill,” Deveny said. Until that happens, filling
the IRA’s emissions gaps will take a lot of work “in every sector of the
economy,” he added.
</p>
<p>
Lena Moffitt, the executive director of
<a href="https://www.evergreenaction.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Evergreen
Action</u></a> — which has already released
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/evergreen-action-harris-plan" target="_self"><u>a
comprehensive 2025 climate roadmap</u></a> for a Harris administration —
told me that the task of “doubling down on Biden’s climate legacy as a
job creator” will run through rebuilding and expanding the grid and
revitalizing industry and rural economies, two projects that started in
the IRA but remain incomplete. “We’d love to see a day one executive
order from the White House outlining a plan to create American jobs and
seize the mantle of leadership by building clean energy and clean tech
in the United States,” she told me.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/manchin-barrasso-permitting-bill" target="_self"><u>Permitting
reform</u></a> is part of that — and could be another piece of
yet-unfinished business Harris will need to wrap up. “If that doesn’t
get done this year, that is what we have to look to as soon as possible
during a future Harris administration,” Harry Godfrey, who leads
Advanced Energy United’s Federal Investment and Manufacturing Working
Group, told me.
</p>
<p>
That’s not the only regulatory matter still up in the air. Austin
Whitman, the CEO of
<a href="https://www.changeclimate.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The
Climate Change Project</u></a>, a non-profit that offers climate
certification labeling and helps businesses reduce their emissions, told
me that the Federal Trade Commission, for example, still hasn’t updated
its green guides — “a loose collection of recommendations to companies
on how to behave to not violate the FTC Act” — since 2012. “We just need
a clear timeline and a sense of direction of where that whole process is
going,” Whitman told me. Additionally, he said that the government has a
substantial and outstanding role to play in standardizing and
streamlining
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/california-climate-corporate-data-accountability-act-financial-risk" target="_self"><u>emissions
reporting practices</u></a> for businesses — which, while perhaps not
“very sexy,” are necessary to “relieve the administrative burden so
companies can focus on decarbonization.”
</p>
<p>
The last piece: Make sure everything that’s already in place is actually
working. “We’re seeing that states and local governments need additional
capacity to manage [the IRA] money well,” Jillian Blanchard, the
director of
<a href="https://www.lawyersforgoodgovernment.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lawyers
For Good Government</u></a>’s climate change program, told me. Harris
could help by enacting “more tangible policies like granting federal
funding to hire community engagement specialists or liaisons or paying
for the time of community leaders to provide local governments with key
information on where the communities are that need to be benefited, and
what they need.” She also floated the idea of a
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/inflation-reduction-act/community-change-grants-selections" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Community
Change Grant</u></a> extension to help get federal funding to localities
more directly.
</p>
<h3>
Harris should go bigger — on everything
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Make investments in high-impact sectors
</li>
<li>
Fund more Climate Pollution Reduction Grants
</li>
<li>
Funnel additional resources into the states
</li>
<li>
Reinstate the U.S. as a global leader on climate
</li>
</ul>
<p>
“One of the criticisms of the Inflation Reduction Act is that it didn’t
do ‘X’ — whatever ‘X’ is,” Costa Samaras, the director of the
<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Wilton
E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation</u></a> at Carnegie Mellon and
a former senior White House energy official, told me. “And in reality,
it probably <em><em>did</em></em>. It just didn’t do it big enough.”
</p>
<p>
As opposed to those who thought Harris should take a quieter, dare I say
conservative approach to advancing the U.S. climate agenda, Samaras told
me he wanted to see Harris pump up the volume. The current climate
moment requires “attacking the places where we need to immediately make
big emissions cuts and big resilience investments. This is the
industrial sector, the cultural sector, heavy transportation, as well as
making sure that our cities and communities are built for people.”
</p>
<p>
There are plenty of existing programs that could take some supersizing.
Godfrey of Advanced Energy United brought up the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/inflation-reduction-act-solar-panels-heat-pumps?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4" target="_self"><u>home
energy rebate programs</u></a>, arguing that as things stand, those
resources are only serving “a fraction of the eligible population.”
Blanchard of Lawyers For Good Government also pointed out that the
Environmental Protection Agency had
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/climate/epa-climate-change-money.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>almost
300</u></a> Climate Pollution Reduction Grant applications totaling
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-to-unveil-climate-grant-recipients-next-month/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than $30 billion in requests</u></a> — but only $4.3 billion to hand
out. “There are local governments, state governments, tribal nations,
and territories hungry for this money to implement clean energy
projects,” she said. “There are plans that are ready to go if there are
additional federal award dollars in the future.”
</p>
<p>
Another place Harris could expand on Biden’s legacy would be by
reinstating the U.S. as a climate leader on the world stage. “We need to
say, ‘climate is back on the table,’” Whitman of The Climate Change
Project told me. “It’s a main course, and we’re going to talk about it”
— something that would give us “a more credible seat at the negotiating
table at the COPs.”
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most importantly, though, Harris needs to use her term to start
looking toward the future. As Deveny of Climate Vision told me, “We
designed the IRA to think about meeting our 2030 target. And now we have
to think about 2035.” Looking ahead isn’t “just about extending
policies,” in other words, but about anticipating new technologies and
opportunities that could arise in the next decade — and Harris, if
elected, should step up to the challenge.
</p>
<h3>
Harris needs a bold, original vision
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Start an “industrial renaissance”
</li>
<li>
Make polluters pay
</li>
<li>
Invest trillions into transforming every part of the economy
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some believe Harris shouldn’t limit herself to the framework of the IRA
as it exists now — that she needs to dream bigger and better than
anything seen under the Biden administration. “The question is: Are we
going to just ride the coattails of the IRA as if this problem is mostly
solved? Or are we going to put forward a whole new, bold vision of how
we can take things on?” Saul Levin, the political director of the Green
New Deal Network, wondered to me.
</p>
<p>
According to Deveny of Climate Vision, that means continuing to build on
“our industrial renaissance.”
</p>
<p>
“We have really awakened a sleeping giant of clean industrial
manufacturing in this country to make solar panels, wind turbines, and
batteries,” he explained. “We can also lead the world in clean
industrial manufacturing for steel, cement, and other heavy industry
projects.” Samaras of Carnegie Mellon, too, shared this vision. “By the
end of a potential Harris Administration first term, the path to zero
emissions should be visible everywhere,” he told me. Also on his
wishlist were “abundant energy-efficient and affordable housing,
accessible clean mobility infrastructure everywhere, schools and post
offices as community clean energy and resilience hubs, and climate-smart
agriculture and nature-based solutions across the country,” plus greater
investment in adaptation.
</p>
<p>
“The fact is that both the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation
Reduction Act are the largest investments in resilience we’ve ever
done,” he said. But “we have to think about it the same way we have to
think about mitigation,” he went on. “It’s the largest thing we’ve ever
done — comma, <em><em>so far</em></em>.”
</p>
<p>
One of the biggest openings for Harris to distinguish herself from
Biden, though, would be by taking a tougher tone with big polluters.
Biden had shown
<a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-08-30/la-smog-ozone-health-standard-biden-epa-delay" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>less
of an appetite</u></a> for going after businesses, several times
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/16/climate/biden-climate-second-term.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>kicking
the can down the road</u></a> on a decision to what would have been his
second term. Harris, by contrast, is well positioned with her background
as a prosecutor and already went as far as to call for a “climate
pollution fee” and the creation of an independent Office of Climate and
Environmental Justice and Accountability
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/kamala-harris-stands-green-new-deal-climate-initiatives/story?id=112152079" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>during
her 2019-2020 campaign</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“We love seeing her already reference from the stump that there is a lot
that she can do with Congress or through the executive branch to hold
polluters accountable for the toll that they have taken on families and
our climate,” Moffitt of Evergreen Action told me. “That could look like
a host of things, from repealing subsidies to using the Department of
Justice to hold polluters accountable.” Maria Langholz, the senior
director of
<a href="https://team-arc.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Arc
Initiatives</u></a>, a strategy group that works with climate-related
organizations, told me in an email that her team would also like to see
the Harris administration revoke the presidential permit for Enbridge’s
Line 5 pipeline as high, in addition to developing a public interest
determination “that fully addresses the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lng-front-line-communities-louisiana" target="_self"><u>social</u></a>,
environmental, and economic impacts of LNG.”
</p>
<p>
But Levin, more than anyone else, wanted to see Harris pursue a
“moonshot campaign from day one,” he said. “Hoping that tweaking the IRA
is an appropriate solution to climate change is totally out of step with
mainstream scientific consensus. It’s absolutely ridiculous. At the end
of the day, we need to fundamentally transform our economy so that all
people can survive climate change.” To have a prayer of meeting the
IRA’s climate goals — let alone putting a meaningful dent in America’s
contribution to global emissions — the U.S. must “invest trillions of
dollars in transforming our transportation system, our building sector,
our food and agriculture sector, and every part of the economy so that
we can create a livable, sustainable world forever that works for
everyone.”

<h2 id="elon-bought-the-airport">Elon bought the airport</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Elon Musk bought the biggest airport on the social web. A major world
hub like Atlanta, London or Dubai.
</p>
<p>
Bluesky is a regional airport in a cool place, maybe Austin.
</p>
<p>
Mastodon is a small network of airports, like the ones served by Ryanair
in Europe.
</p>
<p>
Threads is potentially one of the big airports like the one Musk bought,
but it’s not as much of a hub yet. Orlando? Frankfurt?
</p>
<p>
There are lots of scheduled flights in and out of X because it’s where
most of the traffic already goes. It’s quite possibly not running that
smoothly, like perhaps JFK in NYC, always a mess, under construction,
huge traffic, broken systems.
</p>
<p>
But it does actually work pretty reliably most of the time.
</p>
<p>
When I was first getting started in tech, when we got the initial angel
funding for
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Videotext">LVT</a>, I
asked the lead investor, Bill Jordan, if Apple was going to go out of
business. At the time, 1983, a lot of people said it would. He asked
what their sales were. $1 billion, I said. He said they’re not going
away. Companies that large don’t disappear. After 40 years of experience
in tech since then, Bill was right. Companies that lead markets very
rarely disappear. It does happen. But not often. More likely is Musk
will right the ship, and it will grow to dominate the market. Threads
will possibly be Pepsi. Mastodon will be Home Depot. Bluesky will be
Laurel Canyon. Or who knows?
</p>
<p>
But there’s a high probability that Musk’s company will exist in some
form, and make us feel sick, every day, about what could have been. 😀

DC, councilmember arrested on bribery charge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A Washington, D.C., councilmember known for promoting
antisemitic conspiracy theories has been arrested on charges that he
accepted over $150,000 in bribes in exchange for using his elected
position to help companies with city contracts, according to court
records unsealed on Monday.</p>
<p>Trayon White Sr., a Democrat who ran an unsuccessful mayoral campaign
in 2022, was arrested on a federal bribery charge by the FBI on Sunday.
He is expected to make his initial court appearance on Monday.</p>
<p>An FBI agent’s affidavit says White agreed in June to accept roughly
$156,000 in kickbacks and cash payments in exchange for pressuring
government agency employees to extend two companies’ contracts for
violence intervention services. The contacts were worth over $5
million.</p>
<p>White, 40, also accepted a $20,000 bribe payment to help resolve a
contract dispute for one of the companies by pressuring high-level
district officials, the affidavit alleges.</p>
<p>An FBI informant who agreed to plead guilty to fraud and bribery
charges reported giving White gifts including travel to the Dominican
Republic and Las Vegas along with paying him bribes, the FBI said.</p>
<p>White, who has served on the D.C. council since 2017, represents a
predominantly Black ward where the poverty rate is nearly twice as high
as the overall district. He is running for re-election in November
against a Republican challenger.</p>
<p>White’s chief of staff and communication director didn’t immediately
respond to emails seeking comment.</p>

<h2 id="dont-mess-with-texas-heat">Don’t Mess With Texas Heat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The heat is chilling out this week, meaning today’s update is a short
one. If you’re in the Northeast, start dreaming of pumpkins and hot
cocoa. If you live farther south … keep running that AC a little longer.
</p>
<h3>
Fall is in sight — for some
</h3>
<p>
Those in the Northeast can start airing out their sweaters this week.
According to Paul Pastelok, AccuWeather senior meteorologist, a
long-lasting jet stream should bring temperatures 5 to 10 degrees
Fahrenheit below historical averages through the end of August. The
region can also expect some precipitation and stronger storms, which
will likely bring down temperatures even more.
</p>
<p>
The Pacific Northwest will also get fall-like weather this week,
Pastelok told me, which will move into the Great Lakes and the Ohio
Valley on Thursday. <strong>For much of the South and the Gulf Coast,
however, forecasts are not looking as optimistic. </strong>Pastelok told
me it’s possible that both Albuquerque, New Mexico and Lubbock, Texas
will break heat records this week, getting well into the 90s and 100s,
respectively.
</p>
<p>
After a brief respite, the heat will also return to the western Dakotas,
Nebraska, Wyoming, and southeast Montana. Some parts of the Pacific
Northwest that started the week feeling fall-ish might end it back in
summer, as temperatures creep back up on the eastern side of the region.
By Friday, Texas will have it worst.
</p>
<h3>
Park Fire slows down
</h3>
<p>
<strong>The Park Fire seems to have finally halted </strong>— it hasn’t
grown past 429,000 acres burned since last week. Containment is now at
53%. and no new counties have been affected.<strong> “I think there’s a
reasonable chance that the fire has largely reached its final
footprint,” </strong>said Climate scientist of the University of
California, Los Angeles Daniel Swain during a live briefing on Friday.
</p>
<p>
After experiencing its hottest July ever, California will finally get a
break from the heat this week as the low pressure along the northwest
coast will send cool air down into California, Pastelok told me. “The
combination of smoke and westerly winds will cool northern California,
as well as the coastal areas down to southern California,” he said.
</p>
<p>
But that doesn’t mean fire conditions are going away, Swain explained.
As long as things stay windy and dry, the risk will remain, and a new
heat wave arriving around the end of August could up the danger even
higher.
</p>
<h3>
Greece’s worst wildfire of the year almost reached Athens
</h3>
<p>
Gigantic wildfires in Greece stopped just shy of Athens. The fire spread
incredibly quickly last week due to powerful winds, with flames as high
as 80 feet — the mayor of Kifisia, Vasilis Xypolitas, told
<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/13/europe/greece-athens-wildfires-evacuation-residents-intl/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>CNN</u></a>
that at one point, the fire was moving faster than cars. Thousands of
residents had to be evacuated.
</p>
<p>
While the flames have since died down, they burned through almost
260,000 acres, causing extensive damage to cities and villages. Houses,
schools, and hospitals have been completely destroyed and many residents
might have to wait weeks before electricity is restored. One death has
been confirmed.
</p>
<p>
The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but Greece has been
suffering through a particularly hot and dry summer — prime conditions
for relentless fires. This year, the country saw its hottest June and
July on record.
</p>
<h3>
Another heat wave in the Balkans
</h3>
<p>
Southeastern Europe has recently seen temperatures above 100 degrees
during a heat wave that is expected to persist this week. This is the
latest heat wave to hit Romania, which has already suffered through
drought and extreme weather this summer. While some rain is predicted
for the country this week, temperatures will continue to run above
average
</p>
<p>
Bosnia has also been particularly hard hit, and farmers there have
noticed a significant impact to production this year. Around Bijeljina,
where most of the country’s grain production takes place,
<strong>farmers estimate that half their crops have been damaged due to
the heat</strong>. The whole country has seen little to no precipitation
this summer, with temperatures constantly above 95 degrees.

<p class="drop-caps">
For my entire life, I’ve heard politicians talk about bringing
manufacturing jobs back to America. Now it is <em><em>finally</em></em>
happening. “We’re not going back!” has become Kamala Harris’s
<a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rallying
cry</u></a>, and it’s apt here too, because those jobs and industries of
the future are what’s at stake in this election.
</p>
<p>
The Biden-Harris administration and the 117th Congress enacted a trio of
laws — the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, otherwise known as the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law — that made major public investments to
cultivate and strengthen several key industries of the future:
semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, solar and wind
manufacturing, hydrogen-based energy, and clean steel.
</p>
<p>
Those new laws (and other Biden-Harris Administration actions on trade
and tariffs) have directed and amplified a megatrend in “reshoring” and
driven a huge surge in private sector investments in U.S. manufacturing,
creating tens of thousands of good jobs in communities across America.
Investment in manufacturing construction has
<a href="https://x.com/JesseJenkins/status/1823811245868507216" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than doubled</u></a> since passage of the IRA and CHIPS, and the U.S.
has seen nearly
<a href="https://www.jackconness.com/ira-chips-investments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>127,000
new jobs created</u></a>, according to Energy Innovation policy analyst
Jack Conness.
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Just last week, on the occasion of the IRA’s two-year anniversary,
Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo wrote about a new report finding that 6,285
utility-scale clean energy projects in the U.S. may be eligible for IRA
tax credits, meaning
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ira-anniversary-labor" target="_self"><u>3.9
million jobs</u></a>, all of which will be subject to minimum pay
standards if they want the federal rewards.
</p>
<p>
These investments are supporting a diverse set of communities across
America. Of the nearly $71 billion of clean energy manufacturing
investments announced in 2023,
<a href="https://cleaneconomytracker.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than $59 billion</u></a> — around 83% — were in House districts
represented by Republicans per the
<a href="https://cleaneconomytracker.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Clean
Economy Tracker</u></a>, a partnership between Atlas Public Policy and
Utah State University. That’s tens of billions of dollars flowing into
rural areas, including a significant chunk going to “energy
communities,” areas that have historically produced, processed, or
transported fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
We all know that manufacturing plants can be an anchor employer for a
community and play an even more important role than the direct jobs
numbers reveal. The opening of dozens of new advanced manufacturing
plants means dozens of communities across America have a brighter
economic future — <strong> </strong>or at least, they do for now.

<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>Project
2025</u></a>, the Heritage Foundation’s vision for “the next
conservative administration,” contains a set of plans and policies that
would put all those communities and hundreds of thousands of good paying
jobs in jeopardy. Energy Innovation
<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/The-Second-Half-of-The-Decisive-Decade-Potential-U.S.-Pathways-on-Climate-Jobs-and-Health.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>modeled</u></a>
the policy scenario outlined in Project 2025 against one in which the
U.S. meets its stated goal of reducing emissions 50% to 52% below 2005
levels by 2030 and found that the former would lead to
<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Change-in-jobs-Project-2025-v-Continued-Climate-Leadership.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>3.9
million fewer jobs</u></a> in 2030 compared to the latter, including 1.7
million jobs straight-up lost. The overall economic effect would be
catastrophic: a
<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Change-in-GDP-Project-2025-v-Continued-Climate-Leadership.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$320
billion annual drop</u></a> in GDP in 2030, compared to a $450 billion
per year gain if the U.S. meets its clean energy and climate goals.
</p>
<p>
Trump has publicly disavowed Project 2025, but the evidence for his
private alignment with its authors and principles continues to mount —
most recently the release of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR8e1IJgZSM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>secret
Project 2025 training videos</u></a>, featuring more than two-dozen
former Trump administration figures.
</p>
<p>
Project 2025 calls for gutting the IRA and the infrastructure law, which
would, in the words of a
<a href="https://www.thirdway.org/memo/american-manufacturing-is-making-a-comeback-a-second-trump-term-would-send-it-packing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>memo
released</u></a> last week by the center-left think tank Third Way, “end
crucial federal investments in US manufacturing, scrap tax incentives
that help U.S. manufacturers compete with China, and make it harder for
U.S. manufacturers to obtain loans.” It would also have ominous
implications for America’s geopolitical position in the medium- to
long-term. “Funding basic research and then cutting all subsequent
support, as Trump plans to do, opens the door for other countries to
swoop in and claim market share,” the authors write. This has happened
before: The U.S. developed much of the solar and battery technology
China is now using to dominate those global markets.
</p>
<p>
That’s to say nothing of the overall environment of chaos and policy
uncertainty that comes with a Trump presidency, which wreaks havoc on
business investment. Business leaders would be wise to remember
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/09/05/trump-obama-economy/#:~:text=15.%20Business%20investment" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>what
it was like</u></a> under Trump 1.0. Trump might promise corporate tax
cuts, but with a strong economy, cooling inflation, and a vibrant
manufacturing renaissance finally underway, the worst thing we could do
is pull the rug out from under the entire U.S. economic policy framework
— continuity and certainty are good for business.
</p>
<p>
As Greg Sargent
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/184855/trump-weird-nuclear-moment-elon-musk-kamala-opening" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pointed
out</u></a> in <em><em>The New Republic,</em></em> “All this gives
Harris an opening.” The green transition can be exciting, a source of
the kind of joy Harris and her vice presidential nominee, Tim Walz, have
been
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5060012/kamala-harris-tim-walz-campaign-democrats" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stumping
about</u></a>. “Without getting entangled in cultural cross-signaling
around fossil fuels, she can argue that the very last thing we should do
is reverse the clean energy boom. It’s creating lots of jobs building
cool, innovative stuff right in the American heartland.”
</p>
<p>
I, for one, will be looking to see if this contrast starts to show up in
political ads and speeches at this week’s Democratic National Convention
— something like: “Harris will continue investing in U.S. manufacturing
and the industries of the future. Trump will blow that all up. The
choice is on the ballot. And we’re not going back.”
</p>
<p>
What future do you choose?

You’ve seen this over and over and it gets worse all the time. I still

storage over time is not here yet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I’m working on a project which may or may not ship, but it presents an
interesting design challenge either way.
</p>
<p>
The idea is I want to write lots of little bits, less than 5000
characters each, they have titles, use styling, links, include images,
etc.
</p>
<p>
Or it could also be as small as a single emoji.
</p>
<p>
This is what we’ve settled on in 2024 as the basic unit of writing. From
a tweet to a long blog post.
</p>
<p>
I want to make an editor and storage system that fits this model
perfectly based on all we know about this stuff, and the latest server
and network technologies.
</p>
<p>
It should have the best simplest API we know how to make in 2024.
</p>
<p>
In every way it’ll be the nicest, fastest and most flexible way to
create structures of writing over time.
</p>
<p>
In that last sentence is the gotcha – <i>over time. </i>It’s the
frontier, the leading edge. Because in 2024 there’s no way for me, as an
individual developer to create a structure that lasts over time.
</p>
<p>
I can create a structure that has a high probability of lasting a month.
A pretty good chance of lasting a few years, but beyond that, it gets
less likely probably at a pretty good clip and eventually goes over a
cliff.
</p>
<p>
The way I have answered that in the past was with GitHub.
</p>
<p>
In 2017, I started an
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/tree/master/blog">archive</a>
of my <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> writing on
GitHub. It’s still just a fraction of my writing, I’m not doing anything
like that for all my other sites and services. But at least I’ve managed
to set up a system that only requires me to do something once a month,
which is something I like to do because it gives me some assurance the
other mechanisms are still working. Archive systems have bugs too.
</p>
<p>
So I guess for the project I’m doing I will again use GitHub to mirror
the content in the database until and unless GitHub proves unusable for
this purpose, or something much better comes along.
</p>
<p>
Note that GitHub has made no promise about the continued availability of
their service, all we have to go on is that they have been reliable for
enough time to present the <i>illusion</i> of persistence. <span

pandemic-era vow to prioritize employment may soon be tested</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Four years after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell
made fighting unemployment a bigger priority during the COVID-19
pandemic, he faces a pivotal test of that commitment amid rising
joblessness, mounting evidence inflation is under control, and a
benchmark interest rate that is still the highest in a quarter of a
century.   </p>
<p>High interest rates may be on the way out, with the U.S. central bank
expected to deliver a first cut at its Sept. 17-18 meeting and Powell
potentially providing more information about the approach to the policy
easing in a speech on Friday at the Kansas City Fed’s annual conference
in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.   </p>
<p>But with the Fed’s policy rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range for more than
a year, the impact of relatively high borrowing costs on the economy may
still be building and could take time to unwind even if the central bank
starts cutting — a dynamic that could put hopes for a “soft landing” of
controlled inflation alongside continued low unemployment at
risk.   </p>
<p>“Powell says the labor market is normalizing,” with wage growth
easing, job openings still healthy, and unemployment around what
policymakers see as consistent with inflation at the central bank’s 2%
target, former Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said. “That would be
great if that is all there is. The history is not good.”   </p>
<p>Indeed, increases in the unemployment rate like those seen in recent
months are typically followed by more.   </p>
<p>“That does not seem the situation now. But you may only be one or two
poor employment reports away” from needing aggressive rate cuts to
counter rising joblessness, Evans said. “The longer you wait, the actual
adjustment becomes harder to make.” </p>
<p>Inflation versus employment  </p>
<p>Evans was a key voice in reframing the Fed’s policy approach,
unveiled by Powell at Jackson Hole in August 2020 as the pandemic was
raging, policymakers were gathering via video feed, and the unemployment
rate was 8.4%, down from 14.8% that April.   </p>
<p>In that context the Fed’s shift seemed logical, changing a
long-standing bias towards heading off inflation at the expense of what
policymakers came to view as an unnecessary cost to the job
market.   </p>
<p>Standard monetary policymaking saw inflation and unemployment
inextricably and inversely linked: Unemployment below a certain point
stoked wages and prices; weak inflation signaled a moribund job market.
Officials began to rethink that connection after the 2007-2009
recession, concluding they needn’t treat low unemployment as an
inflation risk in itself.   </p>
<p>As a matter of equity for those at the job market’s margins, and to
achieve the best outcomes overall, the new strategy said Fed policy
would “be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from
its maximum level.”   </p>
<p>“This change may appear subtle,” Powell said in his 2020 speech to
the conference. “But it reflects our view that a robust job market can
be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.”   </p>
<p>A pandemic-driven inflation surge and dramatic employment recovery
made that change seem irrelevant: The Fed had to raise rates to tame
inflation, and until recently the pace of price increases had slowed
without much apparent damage to the job market. The unemployment rate
through April had been below 4% for more than two years, an unparalleled
streak not seen since the 1960s. The unemployment rate since 1948 has
averaged 5.7%.   </p>
<p>But the events of the last two years, and a coming Fed strategy
review, have also triggered a wave of research into exactly what
happened: why inflation fell, what role policy played in that, and how
things might be done differently if inflation risks rise again.   </p>
<p>While the agenda for this year’s conference remains under wraps, the
broad theme focuses on how monetary policy influences the economy. That
bears on how officials may evaluate future choices and tradeoffs and the
wisdom of tactics like preempting inflation before it starts.   </p>
<p>Some of that work is already emerging from Fed researchers, including
top economist Michael Kiley. He has authored a paper questioning whether
policy “asymmetry” — treating employment shortfalls differently than a
tight labor market, for example — really helps. Another recent paper
suggested policymakers who believe public inflation expectations are
formed in the short-run and are volatile should react sooner and raise
rates higher in response.   </p>
<p>The role public expectations play in driving inflation — and the
policy response - was on full display in 2022. When it appeared
expectations risked moving higher, the Fed pushed its tightening cycle
into overdrive with 75-basis-point hikes at four consecutive meetings.
Powell then used a truncated Jackson Hole speech to emphasize his
commitment to fight inflation —a stark shift from his jobs-first
commentary two years earlier.   </p>
<p>It was a key moment that put the U.S. central bank’s seriousness on
display, underpinned its credibility with the public and markets, and
rebuilt some of the standing that preemptive policies had lost.   </p>
<p>‘Too tight’ </p>
<p>Powell now faces a test in the other direction. Inflation is
progressing back to 2%, but the unemployment rate has risen to 4.3%, up
eight-tenths of a percentage point from July 2023.   </p>
<p>There’s debate over what that really says about the labor market
versus rising labor supply, a positive thing if new job seekers find
employment.   </p>
<p>But it did breach a rule-of-thumb recession indicator, and while that
has been downplayed given other indicators of a growing economy, it also
is slightly above the 4.2% that Fed officials regard as representing
full employment.   </p>
<p>It’s also higher than at any point in Powell’s pre-pandemic months as
Fed chief: It was 4.1% and falling when he took over in February
2018.   </p>
<p>The “shortfall” in employment that he promised to respond to four
years ago, in other words, may already be taking shape.   </p>
<p>While Powell will be reluctant to ever declare victory over inflation
for fear of touching off exuberant overreaction, Ed Al-Hussainy, senior
global rates strategist at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, said it
was past time for the Fed to get in front of the risk to unemployment -
preemption of a different sort.   </p>
<p>Al-Hussainy said the Fed had proved its ability to keep public
expectations about inflation in check, an important asset, but that
“also has put in motion some downside risk to employment.”   </p>
<p>“The policy stance today is offside — it is too tight — and that
warrants acting on.”</p>

<h1 id="2024-08-18-indie-search-for-oddmu">
2024-08-18 Indie search for Oddmu
</h1>
<p>
This is a follow-up for
<a href="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexes">2024-08-16 JSON feed for
indexing</a> where I linked to
<a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch, byJP</a>.
I want to see what’s required for this to work.
</p>
<p>
First, I need to install Pagefind. Lucky me, I already have a Rust build
environment installed.
</p>
<pre><code>cargo install pagefind
</code></pre>
<p>
Next, I need a static HTML copy of my site:
</p>
<pre><code>env ODDMU_LANGUAGES=de,en  oddmu static -jobs 3 /tmp/alex
</code></pre>
<p>
Create the index:
</p>
<pre><code>pagefind --site /tmp/alex
</code></pre>
<p>
Upload:
</p>
<pre><code>mv /tmp/alex/pagefind .
make upload
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s now available at
<code>https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind</code>.
</p>
<p>
Adding the info to the page header:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;search&quot; type=&quot;application/pagefind&quot; href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind&quot; title=&quot;Alex Schroeder’s Diary&quot;&gt;
&lt;link href=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/wiki/pagefind/pagefind-ui.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) =&gt; {
  new PagefindUI({ element: &quot;#pagefind&quot;, showSubResults: true });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
And a div to the page body:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;pagefind&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
And I had to add <code>‘unsafe-eval’</code> to the
<code>script-src</code> Content-Security-Policy header.
</p>
<p>
Too bad the search result links all end in <code>.html</code> … that
requires an extra rewrite rule, to get rid of. On the other hand, it
also allowed me to get rid of <code>baseUrl: "/view/"</code>.
</p>
<p>
Since there are still rough edges, this search is only available via
<a href="pagefind.html">Pagefind</a>. I’m also not promising any updates
to the index.
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Search">#Search</a>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a>
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-19</strong>. While I was experimenting with this all, I
asked
<a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io"><span
class="citation" data-cites="byjp">@byjp</span></a> some questions.
</p>
<p>
<em>Sites provide local indexes in the Pagefind format, as a static
file?</em>
</p>
<p>
Correct — except it’s many files, organised so as to allow minimal
transfer for a single search query — but all can be retrieved to have a
full local index
</p>
<p>
<em>Clients register one or more of these files and allow searching
them?</em>
</p>
<p>
Correct — they can be retrieved/cached to query locally, or queried
efficiently remotely.
</p>
<p>
<em>Users can install a large number of them, locally? Like I have 23
local dictionaries installed for my dictd and I can query them,
locally.</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes. Many can be kept locally or remotely. The sites you “register”/add
become your search index.
</p>
<p>
<em>Is it possible for a website to offer just a Pagefind installation
with a number of URLs to Pagefind indexes without hosting pages and
indexes? Clients visiting this Pagefind installation would download all
the indexes pointed to in the list and search them locally?</em>
</p>
<p>
Yes (with minor hackery). Each Pagefind instance <em>is</em> the index,
a small bootstrapping JS/WASM blob, and ~5 lines of init JS. Those 5
lines can include locations of multiple indexes for the (exclusively
client-side) JS to query when searching; by default the only one
configured is the “local” index that created with the Pagefind JS/WASM
blob, but you could strip away an empty index and have what you describe
— in fact, that’s what my
<a href="https://www.byjp.me/posts/indiesearch/">IndieSearch</a> demo
does!
</p>
<p>
<em>If instead of visiting a site with a Pagefind installation one
installs a Pagefind browser extensions, is it possible to point it to a
URL that hosts a list of indexes?</em>
</p>
<p>
I haven’t built that (yet), but yeah — I’d want to build an mf2/IndieWeb
compatible “new user experience” that’d guide folks to finding a
good-for-them set of defaults. My demo automatically (provisionally)
adds any site you visit that supports IndieSearch, so you’d get better
coverage fast. I’d also consider default-importing from blogrolls and
the like. (Management &amp; performance gets tricky with 1000s of
indexes. Probs an “if we get there” problem. 😅)
</p>
<p>
<em>Is it possible to “merge” Pagefind indexes and pass those aggregates
on? I’m afraid that having local copies of the indexes means that
clients will have to at least query thousands of sites for updates to
their page indexes.</em>
</p>
<p>
Not yet, but I asked exactly this question of the Pagefind devs and they
offered that it’s currently too hard, but that there is a potential
route they’d consider, see
<a href="https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/discussions/564#discussioncomment-8702059">#564</a>.
</p>
<p>
<em>Thank you so much for answering the questions!</em>
</p>
<p>
I’m still thinking about the situation where I’m part of a community and
we want to all share search, like using
<a href="https://lieu.cblgh.org/">Lieu</a> for a webring – except I’d
like a solution where I don’t have to do the crawling.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, the communities I’m part of are planets such as
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/rpg/">RPG Planet</a> or
<a href="https://planet.emacslife.com/">Planet Emacslife</a>, each with
hundreds of blogs. I suppose most of them don’t offer a Pagefind index,
being hosted on Blogspot and Wordpress, but what I’m considering is
ingesting their feed and indexing it. This could be a service I could
perform for people. Luckily, it’s often possible to get all the blog
pages via the feed. This is how I’ve made
<a href="2010-05-31_Blognapping">local backups of other people’s
blogs</a>. I guess that each site would be a separate index, however?
</p>
<p>
I’d like to find a way that doesn’t require me to always download all
the pages. I’d like to find a way to update the index as it’s being
used.
</p>
<p>
I’d need a way to figure out how to configure it such that the results
link back to the original pages, of course.
</p>
<p>
Another thing I’m considering is that my own site is rendered live, from
Markdown files… it’s not a static site. So ideally I’d be able to ingest
Markdown files directly. Or I can go the route of exporting it all into
a big feed and ingesting that, once I’ve solved the problem above, I
guess. But the problem above might also be easier to solve by extracting
HTML pages from the feed. It’s what I’ve done in the past. Create
something that works, first, then improve it later?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, ideas are swirling around.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-08-19</strong>. I notice more things that aren’t quite
working the way I like them to work.
</p>
<p>
The sort order of the results is less than ideal, for example. I like to
emphasize more recent blog posts. Pagefind, however, returns them in
some sort of scoring order so that I’ve seen quite a few results with
pages around 20 years old.
</p>
<p>
Image previews seem to rarely work. I suspect the problem is pages in
subfolders linking to images in that same subfolder. Such relative links
don’t need a path – but they do if Pagefind is not in the same
directory.
</p>
<p>
Here’s another thing to consider: The index takes up more space than the
full HTML of the entire site, compressed!
</p>
<pre><code>alex@sibirocobombus ~&gt; du -sh alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz 
 43M    alexschroeder.ch/wiki/pagefind
9.7M    alexschroeder.ch/wiki/feed.json.gz
</code></pre>
<p>
So the Pagefind index takes about 4× more space than the full HTML, for
this site. This matches my experience with better indexing for my own
site where I experimented with full text indexes and trigram indexes.
Back then:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
the 15 MiB of markdown files seem to have generated an index of 70 MiB –
<a href="2023-09-11-oddmu">2023-09-11 Oddµ memory consumption</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Of course, in terms of copyright incentives, handing off the entire site
like that is tricky. Doing it with a feed feels OK. Doing it for a
search engine seems like handing the keys to Google. This provides an
incentive to use a pre-computed index.
</p>
<p>
It also reminds me that the idea I had of building a search engine out
of feed slurping without consent is probably a bad idea – like all ideas
based on non-consensual acts.
</p>
<p>
Whether self-indexing is a good thing in terms of avoiding an
English-first focus I don’t know. I suspect that most people will be
using free software and therefore there’s no reason to suspect that a
search engine doesn’t have the means to process the languages. Then
again, that’s a lock-in where in order to support a new language, you
have to support the software your favourite search-engine supports. So
people indexing our own pages might have long term benefits.
</p>
<p>
I’m still wondering about the comparison of Pagefind and Lunr, to be
honest. How many such static search solutions are there? Is there a
benefit of one implementation over another?
</p>
<p>
I guess now I should look into Pagefind some more? Indexing non-HTML
pages, handling image previews for pages not in the root directory and
relative image source URLs, the sort order of results, the use of the
.html extension in results… there are still rough edges as far as I am
concerned – and per discussion above the onus is on me to fix my
indexing. 😭

<h1 id="2024-08-16-json-feed-for-indexing">
2024-08-16 JSON feed for indexing
</h1>
<p>
Recently,
<a class="account" href="https://toot.cat/@dredmorbius" title="@dredmorbius@toot.cat"><span
class="citation" data-cites="dredmorbius">@dredmorbius</span></a> wrote
about Google and search and posed the question:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
What if websites indexed their own content, and published a permuted
index in a standard format, in a cache-and-forward model similar to how
DNS works?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A while ago I wondered about
<a href="2023-03-07_A_vision_for_search">self-published indexes</a>. We
have software to generate feeds. Why not software to generate indexes?
Back then I proposed a JSON format. Today I finally took a look at
<a href="https://www.jsonfeed.org/version/1.1/">JSON Feed</a>. I think
it has everything we need.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at the example for this site:
<a href="/.well-known/search-feed.json.gz">.well-known/search-feed.json.gz</a>.
This file has about 9.7MiB. The source material is 6740 Markdown pages,
a total of about 21.5MiB, or 8.4MiB compressed.
</p>
<p>
Using the <code>next_url</code> attribute, it would be possible to split
this file up into chunks of 100 pages each, or a chunk per year, if the
platform promises that older pages never change. This wouldn’t work for
my wiki, but perhaps it would for certain platforms.
</p>
<p>
Somebody will have write up a best-practice on how to use HTTP headers
to avoid downloading the whole file when nothing has changed. Sadly,
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13">section
13 of RFC 2616</a> is pretty convoluted. Basically something about the
use of If-Modified-Since and ETags headers.
</p>
<p>
We also need to agree on how to use some of the JSON Feed attributes.
</p>
<p>
<code>content_text</code>: If used, all markup should be ignored by the
server (no guessing whether the text is Markdown or not). It would be
fine if this contained just the text nodes of the HTML, separated by
spaces. This can be useful to see whether words occur in the text, how
frequent they are, etc.
</p>
<p>
<code>content_html</code>: This is the preferred way to include pages in
the index. It is up to the search engine provider to extract useful
information from the HTML, including summaries, extracts, scoring, etc.
It is up to index providers to provide the kind of HTML they think
serves search engines best. This includes using the semantic HTML tags
and dropping style, scripts, footers and other elements that might be
used by search engines to reduce the relevance of the item.
</p>
<p>
I also find <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5005">RFC
5005</a> to be very instructive in how to think about feeds for
archiving.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://neuromatch.social/@jonny" title="@jonny@neuromatch.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> commented, saying
that it was important to think about how search indexes were going to be
used:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
so given that no single machine would or should store a whole index of
the internet or even all your local internet, you can go a few ways with
that, take the global quorum sensing path and you get a bigass global
dht-like thing like ipfs. if instead you think there should be some
structure, then you need proximity. is that social proximity where we
swap indexes between people we know? or webring like proximity dependent
on pages linking to each other and mutually indexing their neighborhood?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It’s an interesting question but I think I want incremental improvements
to the current situation. So if a person has a website right now, on
server, what’s the simplest thing they can do so that they aren’t
drowned in crawlers and can still be found via search? That would be
publishing an index, analogous to publishing a feed. Having more search
engines (even if using legacy centralized architecture) would be better
than what we have now. Not depending on crawlers would be better what we
have now.
</p>
<p>
In terms of decentralisation, I think I like community search engines
like lieu. The idea is great: a community lists a bunch of sites. Lieu
generates a web ring and crawls them to build an index of all the member
sites. Instead of crawling, it could fetch the indexes. This would be
much better than what it does right now, because right now, lieu uses
colly for crawling and colly ignores robots.txt. This means that
<a href="2024-06-22-lieu">lieu instantly bans itself when it visits my
site</a> because it’s not rate limited. It’s just an implementation
detail, but sadly I am biased. I’ve been on a Butlerian Jihad since 2009
when I discover that <a href="2009-10-15_Network_Traffic">over 30% of
all requests I serve from my sites are for machines, not humans</a>.
</p>
<p>
It makes me want to raise my keyboard and scream “CO₂ for the CO₂ god!!”

<p>
But back to the problem of indexing. Right now, search engine operators
and their parasites, the search engine optimisation enterprises, crawl
every single page including page histories, page diffs, and more, on my
wikis. If every wanna-be search engine downloaded my index once a day, I
would be saving resources. Whether that’s a step in the right direction,
I don’t know.

<p>
Indeed, there must be another way. I just don’t see it, right now. It’s
always hard to imagine a new world while you’re still living in the old
one. I’m sure the solution will seem obvious to the next generation,
looking back.

suggested that this was the same as the sitemaps.org concept, but I
think the sitemap lists the URLs available and you still have to crawl
the site. At least now you never miss a page.
</p>
<p>
Would having such an index generate too much traffic? I think it would
worm if all other crawling would stop. That’s the necessary trade-off,
of course. No stupid crawlers lost in my wiki admin links (history
pages, diffs) wasting resources – that is my goal. Also, since I ask for
a crawl delay, crawling has to reconnect all the time, negotiate TLS all
the time, start up CGI scripts all the time… having basically a static
snapshot for download would obviate that (in a world where crawlers are
smart enough to understand that the don’t need to crawl).

<a class="account" href="https://hachyderm.io/@byjp" title="@byjp@hachyderm.io"><span

problem is even better: the server provides indexes that are used
client-side and a browser extension allows querying multiple such
indexes, locally.

Lunr.js is a small, full-text search library for use in the browser. It
indexes JSON documents and provides a simple search interface for
retrieving documents that best match text queries.

After indexing, Pagefind adds a static search bundle to your built

no configuration. – <a href="https://pagefind.app/">Pagefind</a>

id="years-on-harlem-week-shows-how-a-new-york-city-neighborhood-went-from-crisis-to-renaissance">50
years on, Harlem Week shows how a New York City neighborhood went from
crisis to renaissance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — In 1974, Harlem’s deserted streets and tumbledown
tenements told the story of a neighborhood left behind. Decades of
disinvestment had culminated in a mass exodus known as urban flight and
residents watched as their wealthier, more educated counterparts left
the New York City neighborhood in droves.</p>
<p>But the tide turned when Percy Sutton, then the Manhattan borough
president and New York City’s highest-ranking Black elected official,
launched a campaign to bring back vitality to the historically African
American neighborhood that had been known as a global Black mecca of
arts, culture and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>It became known as Harlem Week and would go on to draw back those who
had departed. On Sunday, organizers celebrated Harlem Week’s 50th
anniversary after 18 days of free programming that showcased all the
iconic neighborhood has to offer.</p>
<p>Harlem Week stands as “the constant line through the last 50 years of
America’s most historic Black neighborhood,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton,
whose National Action Network is headquartered in the neighborhood. “The
dream of Percy Sutton and his peers in government, arts, the church and
other elements of Harlem lives on, stronger than ever.”</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Harlem demanded more than an ordinary festival, if it
wanted a resurrection. Those who remained in Harlem during urban flight
— mostly low-income, Black families — would turn on their televisions to
constant despair: crime reports, bleak statistics and reporters who
called their home a “sinking ship.”</p>
<p>Sutton knew Harlem was due for a revitalizing, uplifting moment.</p>
<p>That summer, Sutton rallied religious, political, civic and artistic
leaders that included Tito Puente, Max Roach, Maya Angelou, James
Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, Ruby Dee and Lloyd Williams.
Together, they devised an event that would pivot the spotlight from
Harlem’s troubles to its vibrant legacy: Harlem Day.</p>
<p>Radio disc jockeys Hal Jackson and Frankie Crocker produced a concert
at the plaza of the Harlem State Office Building, while actor Ossie
Davis cut a ribbon at 138th street and 7th Avenue, announcing the start
of the “Second Harlem Renaissance.”</p>
<p>The ribbon-cutting ceremony renamed 7th Avenue to Adam Clayton Powell
Jr. Boulevard, named for the first African American elected to Congress
from New York, marking the first time a New York City street took the
name of a person of color.</p>
<p>“About two or three weeks later, Percy Sutton called us all and said
it was such a successful day,” said Lloyd Williams, one of Harlem Day’s
co-founders and the current president of the Greater Harlem Chamber of
Commerce. “It meant so much to the other cities that were being deserted
in Detroit and Baltimore, Washington and Chicago, that they asked if we
would do it again on an annual basis.”</p>
<p>They did, and Harlem Day evolved into Harlem Weekend and eventually
Harlem Week, which, before the pandemic, expanded to a full month of
programming.</p>
<p>“Only in Harlem could a week be more than seven days,” said Williams,
whose family has lived in Harlem since 1919.</p>
<p>This year’s celebration featured entertainment, including a
headlining set by hip-hop artist Fabolous, a tribute to Harry Belafonte
and Broadway performances. Other concerts showcased jazz, reggae,
R&amp;B and gospel traditions nurtured in Harlem, alongside hundreds of
food and merchandise vendors.</p>
<p>Organizers also included empowerment initiatives, such as financial
literacy workshops and health screenings, at Harlem Health Village and
the Children’s Festival. Every child who attended received a
back-to-school backpack.</p>
<p>Harlem Week always has been a living tribute to Harlem’s history of
greats, such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Augusta Savage and
Aaron Douglas. It recognizes the Harlem Renaissance and Black Arts
Movement and honors landmarks like the Apollo Theater and Schomburg
Center for Research in Black Culture.</p>
<p>Many historians consider the late 1960s and the 1970s to be Harlem’s
darkest years.</p>
<p>The area had been battered by unrest, including a 1964 riot that
killed an unarmed Black teenager, Malcolm X’s assassination in 1965 and
the turmoil after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in
1968. Household incomes fell dramatically and infant mortality rates
were high.</p>
<p>“The neighborhood was blighted,” recalled Malik Yoba, an actor born
in the Bronx in 1967 who grew up in Harlem and spent days playing in the
dirt of vacant lots. Yoba attended school in the Upper East Side with
peers who had country homes upstate in the Hamptons.</p>
<p>“I didn’t understand why where we lived looked so dramatically
different than where they lived,” he said. “I knew something was
wrong.”</p>
<p>But Harlemites are creatives and entrepreneurs, visionaries and
leaders. Where others saw decline, they saw opportunity, and the
determination to match Harlem with its potential ran high.</p>
<p>Yoba, now 56, built a career as an actor showcasing Harlem to
audiences across the nation. His experiences with housing inequality
also fueled his passion for real estate.</p>
<p>Yoba combats the effects of redlining through his company Yoba
Development, which provides young people of color access to the industry
and has active projects in Baltimore and New York City.</p>
<p>“When you grow up in disenfranchised and divested communities, you
can’t see the forest through the trees,” Yoba said. “You can grow up
believing that walking by burnt-down buildings is your birthright, as
opposed to understanding that building is a business.”</p>
<p>Hazel Dukes, 92, a prominent New York civil rights activist and
Harlem resident of 30 years, has spent her life fighting discrimination
in housing and education. She lived in the same Harlem building as
Sutton and organized alongside him, later becoming a national president
of the NAACP in 1989.</p>
<p>“I know what it feels to be denied,” said Dukes, who was born and
raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and endured Jim Crow segregation. She
moved to New York City with her parents in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Today, property in Harlem is coveted, driven by gentrification and
its enduring cultural appeal.</p>
<p>“There was a waiting list, because everybody wanted to live in
Harlem,” Dukes said. “People want to come to Harlem before they
transition from this world.”</p>

id="thousands-of-activists-expected-at-democratic-convention-to-call-for-gaza-cease-fire">Thousands
of activists expected at Democratic convention to call for Gaza
cease-fire</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-19, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — Thousands of activists are expected to converge on Chicago
this week for the Democratic National Convention, hoping to call
attention to abortion rights, economic injustice and the war in
Gaza.</p>
<p>While Vice President Kamala Harris has energized crowds of supporters
as she prepares to accept the Democratic nomination, progressive
activists maintain their mission remains the same.</p>
<p>Activists say they learned lessons from last month’s Republican
National Convention in Milwaukee and are predicting bigger crowds and
more robust demonstrations in Chicago, a city with deep social activism
roots.</p>
<p>Who is protesting?</p>
<p>Demonstrations are expected every day of the convention and, while
their agendas vary, many activists agree an immediate cease-fire in the
Israel-Hamas war is the priority.</p>
<p>Things are set to kick off Sunday on the convention’s eve with an
abortion rights march along Michigan Avenue.</p>
<p>Organizer Linda Loew said even though Democrats have pushed to
safeguard reproductive rights at home, the issue is international. They
will march in solidarity with people everywhere who struggle for the
right to control what happens to their bodies, as well as to protest the
money the U.S. spends to back wars that could be used for health care,
she said.</p>
<p>“We believe that the billions of dollars that continue to flow to the
state of Israel and the flow of weapons are having an inordinate and
horrific impact, but in particular on women, children and the unborn,”
she said. “All of these things are tied together.”</p>
<p>The largest group, the Coalition to March on the DNC, has planned
demonstrations on the first and last days of the convention.</p>
<p>Organizers say they expect at least 20,000 activists, including
students who protested the war on college campuses.</p>
<p>“The people with power are going to be there,” said Liz Rathburn, a
University of Illinois Chicago student organizer. “People inside the
United Center are the people who are going to be deciding our foreign
policy in one way or another.”</p>
<p>Where are they protesting?</p>
<p>Activists sued the city earlier this year, saying restrictions over
where they can demonstrate violate their constitutional rights.</p>
<p>Chicago leaders rejected their requests for permits to protest near
United Center on the city’s West Side, where the convention is taking
place, offering instead a lakefront park more than 5 kilometers
away.</p>
<p>Later, the city agreed to allow demonstrations at a park and a march
route closer to the United Center. A federal judge recently signed off
on the group’s roughly 1.6-kilometer route.</p>
<p>Coalition to March on the DNC spokesman Hatem Abudayyeh said the
group is pleased it won the right to protest closer to the convention,
but he believes its preferred 3-kilometer march would be safer for
larger crowds. The group is chartering buses for activists from about
half a dozen states.</p>
<p>“We’re going forward, full speed ahead,” he said.</p>
<p>The city has designated a park about a block from United Center for a
speakers’ stage. Those who sign up get 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia-based Poor People’s Army, which advocates for
economic justice, plans to set up at Humboldt Park on the city’s
Northwest Side and will feature events with third-party candidates Jill
Stein and Cornel West, plus a march Monday to the United Center.</p>
<p>Some group members have spent the last few weeks marching the more
than 130 kilometers from Milwaukee, where they protested during the
Republican convention.</p>
<p>“Poor and homeless people are being brutalized, with tents and
encampments destroyed and bulldozed away, from San Francisco to
Philadelphia to Gaza and the West Bank,” spokesperson Cheri Honkala said
in a statement as the group reached Illinois. “These preventable human
rights violations are being committed by Democratic and Republican
leaders alike.”</p>
<p>How does a new nominee change things?</p>
<p>Many activists believe nothing much will change because Harris is
part of the Biden administration.</p>
<p>“The demands haven’t changed. I haven’t seen any policy changes,”
said Erica Bentley, an activist with Mamas Activating Movements for
Abolition and Solidarity. “If you’re going to be here, you’re going to
have to listen to what’s important to us.”</p>
<p>Pro-Palestinian protesters in Chicago have been highly visible,
shutting down roads to the airport and staging sit-ins at congressional
offices. Some are planning their own one-day convention Sunday with
third-party candidates.</p>
<p>“Regardless of who the nominee is, we’re marching against the
Democrats and their vicious policies that have allowed Israel to kill
over 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza,” said Fayaani Aboma Mijana, an
organizer with the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political
Repression.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the convention will draw far-right extremists who
ardently support former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Secret Service Deputy Special Agent in Charge Derek Mayer said last
week there are no known specific security threats against the
convention.</p>
<p>Is Chicago ready?</p>
<p>The convention will draw an estimated 50,000 people to the nation’s
third-largest city, including delegates, activists and journalists.</p>
<p>The city says it has made necessary preparations with police and the
Secret Service. Security will be tight, with street closures around the
convention center.</p>
<p>To combat traffic concerns, city leaders are touting a new $80
million train station steps from the United Center. They also have tried
to beautify the city with freshly planted flowers and new signs. City
leaders also cleared a nearby homeless encampment.</p>
<p>Police have undergone training on constitutional policing, county
courts say they are opening more space in anticipation of mass arrests
and hospitals near the security zone are beefing up emergency
preparedness.</p>
<p>Authorities and leaders in the state have said people who vandalize
the city or are violent will be arrested.</p>
<p>“We’re going to make sure that people have their First Amendment
rights protected, that they can do that in a safe way,” Mayor Brandon
Johnson told The Associated Press in a recent interview.</p>
<p>But some have lingering safety concerns, worried that protests could
become unpredictable or devolve into chaos.</p>
<p>Activist Hy Thurman protested and was arrested at the infamous 1968
convention. The 74-year-old now lives in Alabama but plans to come to
Chicago to protest the war in Gaza.</p>
<p>“It’s extremely personal for me,” he said. “I see parallels.”</p>
<p>Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has said that he expects peaceful
protests.</p>
<p>“We intend to protect the protesters’ First Amendment rights, and
also the residents of the city of Chicago and the visitors to Chicago at

<p>date: 2024-08-18, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
I was surprised that Donald Trump was so famous because I didn’t watch
reality TV. I come from NY and he was a pretty small thing in NY, even
though I guess the rest of the world thinks he’s big in NY.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I come from Queens, actually, so I know the Trump character pretty well
too. Self-important narcissists who inside feel worthless, lashing out
at everything they come in contact with. Not the ordinary Scotch/German
in Queens, but not that rare either.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The same thing is probably happening now with Elon Musk, because
attention of people like me has wandered away from Twitter, but the
audience is huge, and probably every bit as movable as it was for Trump
in 2016, and Musk owns it? Seems so.
</p>
<p>
People who think this is over are fooled, imho.

Korea, Japan, US renew pledge to cooperate on regional challenges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — The leaders of South Korea, Japan and the United
States issued a joint statement Sunday marking the anniversary of their
summit at Camp David and reaffirmed a pledge to jointly tackle regional
challenges, South Korea’s presidential office said.</p>
<p>The principles on trilateral cooperation established at the summit
last year continue to serve as a roadmap for the three countries’
cooperation, the statement issued by South Korean President Yoon Suk
Yeol’s office said.</p>
<p>“We stand by our commitment to consult on regional challenges,
provocations and threats affecting our collective interests and
security,” it said.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and
Yoon met on Aug. 18 last year and agreed to deepen military and economic
cooperation and take a united stand against China’s growing power and
security threats from North Korea.</p>
<p>South Korean media have said the leaders plan to meet again this
year, citing unnamed sources, but it was not yet clear when, especially
since Kishida has announced he would be stepping down.</p>
<p>A senior South Korean presidential official said there will be two or
three occasions where the three leaders will have the chance to meet and
discussions over those plans are still in the early stages.</p>
<p>The spirit of cooperation among the three countries will live on even
after Biden and Kishida leave office, the official told reporters on the
condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“The three main actors who established the Camp David framework of
cooperation won’t be in their roles forever,” he said.</p>

id="wall-street-week-ahead-soft-landing-hopes-are-back-to-lift-us-stocks-after-recession-scare">Wall
Street week ahead — ‘Soft landing’ hopes are back to lift US stocks
after recession scare</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Hopes for an economic soft landing are once again powering
U.S. stocks higher, as encouraging data relieve recession worries
following a brutal sell-off earlier this month.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 .SPX has rebounded more than 6% since Aug. 5, when a
steep drop pushed the benchmark U.S. index to its biggest three-day
slide in over two years. A rapid return to calm was also evident in the
Cboe Volatility Index .VIX, or Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” which has
retreated from last week’s four-year highs at a record pace.</p>
<p>Driving the turnaround are last week’s reports on retail sales,
inflation and producer prices, which helped allay worries over an
economic slowdown sparked by weaker-than-expected employment data at the
start of the month. The favorable data has bolstered the case for
investors looking to hop back aboard many of the trades that have worked
this year, from buying Big Tech stocks to a more recent bet on small and
mid-cap names that accelerated in July.</p>
<p>“There was a real growth scare that had emerged,” said Mona Mahajan,
senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. “Since then, what we’ve
seen is the economic data has actually come out in a much more positive
light.”</p>
<p>Some of 2024’s biggest winners have staged strong rebounds since
Aug. 5. Chipmaker Nvidia NVDA.O has bounced more than 20%, while the
Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index .SOX has gained more than 14%.
Small-cap shares, which had been strong performers in July, have also
recovered from recent lows, with the Russell 2000 .RUT up nearly 5%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders are unwinding bets that the Federal Reserve will
need to deliver jumbo-sized rate cuts in September to stave off a
recession.</p>
<p>As of late Thursday, futures tied to the Fed funds rate showed
traders pricing a 25% chance that the central bank will lower rates by
50 basis points in September, down from around 85% on Aug. 5, CME
FedWatch data showed. The probability of a 25 basis point cut stood at
75%, in line with expectations that the Fed will kick off an easing
cycle in September.</p>
<p>“You can’t necessarily rule out the hard landing scenario outright,
but there’s a lot of reason to believe that at this point that economic
momentum is being sufficiently sustained,” said Jim Baird, chief
investment officer with Plante Moran Financial Advisors.</p>
<p>The Fed’s plans could become clearer when Chair Jerome Powell speaks
at the central bank’s annual economic policy symposium in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming.</p>
<p>“We think a key highlight of Powell’s speech will be the
acknowledgement that progress on inflation has been sufficient to allow
the start of rate cuts,” economists at BNP Paribas said in a note on
Thursday.</p>
<p>For the year, the S&amp;P 500 is up more than 16% and is within about
2% from its July all-time closing high.</p>
<p>Mahajan, of Edward Jones, expects the soft-landing scenario, combined
with lower interest rates, to help pave the way for more stocks to
participate in the market’s rally, instead of the small number of
megacaps that have led indexes higher for much of this year.</p>
<p>Analysts at Capital Economics believe that a U.S. economic soft
landing will support the artificial intelligence fervor that helped
drive markets higher.</p>
<p>“Our end-2024 forecast for the S&amp;P 500 remains at 6,000, driven
by a view that the AI narrative which dominated in the first half of the
year will reassert itself,” they wrote. That target would be some 8%
from the S&amp;P 500’s closing level on Thursday.</p>
<p>The recent economic data, while reassuring, is far from an all-clear
for markets heading into September, which has historically been one of
the year’s more volatile periods. Investors will be closely watching
Nvidia’s earnings at the end of the month, and another employment report
on Sept. 6.</p>
<p>“There’s been a sigh of relief in the market, clearly,” said Quincy
Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial. “The question now is,
will the next payroll report underpin what the market expects at this
point in terms of the soft landing.”</p>

possible <a href="https://this.how/rulesForJournalism/">rule for
journalism</a>. Employ non-journalist op-ed writers. Appointed to a
two-year residence, columns published alongside other op-eds. They
expose flaws in stories that have appeared in the publication, either
news or editorial. They have expertise in areas the publication covers.
They have never been employed as a journalist. They are not part of your
organization, never meet with other writers, have no personal
relationships to preserve. They write from the perspective of a reader.
By giving them equal weight as news or op-ed pieces, it’s more likely
the professional journalists and opinion writers will pay attention.
Maybe they’ll even respond. This is the beginning of accountability. The
“public editors” the news orgs employed briefly were jokes. They never
addressed the serious issues, likely because they lacked the perspective
of a reader, or they had relationships to preserve, or just saw it from
the perspective of an insider. There is an obvious and real problem with
news, and it can never be solved until the people whose work is the
problem see it. Is there a more important area of power that gets so
little outside scrutiny? They say democracy dies in darkness, so does
journalism.</p>

<h2 id="mini-farm-animals-become-trendy-in-us">Mini farm animals become
trendy in US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — They’re adorable. They require less food and space. And
without much coaxing, they might help cut the grass. </p>
<p>Americans are showing more interest in owning miniature cows, goats,
donkeys and other diminutive farm animals, a trend driven by hobby
farmers looking for easy-to-manage livestock and homesteaders who like
the idea of having a petite pig or a scaled-down sheep as a pet. </p>
<p>Animal breeders say sales of pint-sized farm animals have grown since
the COVID-19 pandemic, when more people started raising backyard
chickens for fun and fresh eggs. Like chickens, mini farm animals appeal
to beginners who want the taste of a rugged, agrarian lifestyle. </p>
<p>“A lot of people don’t have access to several acres, but if they have
a one-acre plot, they can keep a miniature cow or a few miniature
goats,” said Brian Gazda, who has a small farm in East Idaho and with
two friends runs a YouTube channel called “Hobby Farm Guys.” </p>
<p>Platforms like YouTube and especially TikTok have played an important
part in raising the profile of mini farm animals, said Martin Fysh, a
vice president and divisional merchandising manager for rural lifestyle
retailer Tractor Supply Co. On any given day, TikTok users put cuteness
on parade with videos of tiny blue-eyed goats and 2-foot-tall horses
that have received millions of views. </p>
<p>But Fysh thinks the trend also reflects a natural progression among
customers who started out with a backyard hen coop. In response, Tractor
Supply has increased its selection of treats for both mini and regular
sized pigs, and goats. </p>
<p>“They’re seen as part of the extended family,” Fysh said. </p>
<p>While some people buy small farm animals as a stepping stone to
owning larger ones, others don’t have a desire to expand. Some owners of
mini farm animals turn their hobbies into side hustles by giving visitor
tours, breeding animals, and blogging about their pastoral
experiences. </p>
<p>But before playing Old Macdonald, newcomers need to weigh the pros
and cons, Gazda and other hobby farmers said. </p>
<p>Among the challenges: the volatile nature of prices for each of the
types of miniature farm animals. And while they’re cute, they also can
be aggressive. </p>
<p>Mini goats </p>
<p>Brittany Snow, a high school English teacher in Florida, owns several
small-sized Nigerian Dwarf goats. She realized her dream of living on a
farm three years ago when her family moved from the Jacksonville suburb
of Middleburg to nearby Melrose. </p>
<p>She said her family wanted to be more self-sustaining after the
pandemic and now sources its own dairy products, such as milk and eggs.
She sticks mostly with miniature animals because they’re easier to take
care of and cost less to acquire and feed. </p>
<p>Snow, 32, started with four Nigerian Dwarf goats: Buttercup,
Snowflake, Cash and Peanut. The herd has since expanded to include
Pancake and Oreo, the kids of Peanut and Buttercup. </p>
<p>Snow purchased the Nigerian Dwarf goats intending to milk them to
make cheese and products like soap and lotion. But that hasn’t worked
yet because goats only lactate after giving birth, and Buttercup only
recently had her kids. </p>
<p>“The past few years have been a learning curve,” Snow said. </p>
<p>Mini goats are one of the most popular entry-level mini animals. In
the past year, animal breeders have registered roughly 8,330 mini goats
with the Miniature Dairy Goat Association. That’s a 73% jump from the 12
months before July 2021, when registrations — mostly for newborn females
sought after by breeders — totaled just under 4,800, said Angelia Alden,
a business operations manager for the North Carolina-based
organization. </p>
<p>Many folks who favor mini goats, however, tend to sell them after a
few years because it can be challenging — and expensive — to take care
of them, Alden said. Rising animal feed costs can be a headache, as is
finding adequate medical care due to a shortage of farm
veterinarians. </p>
<p>Mini cows and donkeys </p>
<p>A farm animal can be both mini and mighty. Some of the four-legged
stars on social media are furry cows that can weigh 500-600 pounds. The
smallest, which stand under 3 feet in height, are known as
micro-miniatures. The slightly bigger miniatures can be as tall as 42
inches, according to Allie Sine, a TikTok creator with more than 737,000
followers on the platform. Videos showcasing some of her mini cows have
gotten millions of views. </p>
<p>Sine, 28, launched her own business breeding and selling mini cows in
2020 after reselling a sick mini cow that cost $350 for $5,000. Last
year, she sold about 190 calves through her Missouri-based business,
Mini Moos LLC. The calves were roughly split between mini and micromini
cows that can cost from $2,000 to $30,000. </p>
<p>“Everything just skyrocketed,” Sine said. </p>
<p>Others report a similar boom. </p>
<p>Kim Furches, who owns a farm with her husband, Ken, in West
Jefferson, North Carolina, said the couple bred mini donkeys for about
20 years and currently own dozens of Mediterranean miniature donkeys,
which stand 3 feet high or less. </p>
<p>Before the pandemic, they would typically sell about eight donkeys
per year and count themselves lucky if they received a couple thousand
dollars for one. They now sell about 20 per year. The last mini donkey
sold for $7,500, Furches said. There are some she’s only willing to sell
for $9,000 or more. </p>
<p>New types of ‘exotic’ pets </p>
<p>Though some of their customers plan to breed and sell mini animals,
too, many say many are just looking for “exotic” pets, Gazda said. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, Jamie Campion, 41, and her husband, Jeff, bought
two Southdown Babydoll sheep from a local breeder near their home in
Thompson’s Station, Tennessee, for $800 each. The couple moved from
Chicago in March 2022 after the pandemic made them rethink their
lifestyle. They now live in a modern-style farmhouse built on an acre of
land. </p>
<p>While Biscuit and Buttermilk have become excellent lawn trimmers,
Jamie Campion said she considers the animals — which weigh about 70
pounds and stand 20 inches high — similar to a dog or a cat. </p>
<p>“They eat the grass, so we don’t even have to buy food (for the
sheep) on a weekly basis,” said Campion who discovered the breed on
Instagram. </p>
<p>But it can be challenging. </p>
<p>One time, Jeff Campion tried to inject one of sheep with oral
medication to treat parasites, and it tore his bicep. </p>
<p>But more often, the sheep give her joy. Jamie Campion recalls taking
them out on a snowy day for a walk in the neighborhood, without a
leash. </p>
<p>“They just followed right behind,” she said. “There’s a whole sheep
and shepherd relationship.” </p>
<p>Miniature animals offer therapy </p>
<p>Others see therapeutic benefits. </p>
<p>Lisa Moad, who owns Seven Oaks Farm in Hamilton, Ohio, and has 13
miniature horses and three regular-size horses, operates a therapy farm
for older people and others. She also used to take the miniature horses
to local nursing homes and hospitals. But since the pandemic, she has
spent most of her timing conducting online training for those looking to
embrace the same mission. </p>
<p>That includes teaching horses how to maneuver around wheelchairs and
into elevators of hospitals. She said her miniature versions still weigh
175 to 200 pounds, though much less than her regular horses, which range
from 1,200 to 1,500 pounds. </p>
<p>“They’re docile, but they can get frightened easily,” she said. “You
just can’t walk into a hospital with a horse.”</p>

<h2 id="us-schools-make-slow-progress-on-record-absenteeism">US schools
make slow progress on record absenteeism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEDFORD, Mass. — Flerentin “Flex” Jean-Baptiste missed so much school
he had to repeat his freshman year at Medford High outside Boston. At
school, “you do the same thing every day,” said Jean-Baptiste, who was
absent 30 days his first year. “That gets very frustrating.”</p>
<p>Then his principal did something nearly unheard of: She let students
play organized sports during lunch — if they attended all their classes.
In other words, she offered high schoolers recess.</p>
<p>“It gave me something to look forward to,” said Jean-Baptiste, 16.
The following year, he cut his absences in half. Schoolwide, the share
of chronically absent students declined from 35% in March 2023 to 23% in
March 2024 — one of the steepest declines among Massachusetts high
schools.</p>
<p>Years after COVID-19 upended American schooling, nearly every state
is still struggling with attendance, according to data collected by The
Associated Press and Stanford University educational economist Thomas
Dee.</p>
<p>Roughly one in four students in the 2022-23 school year remained
chronically absent, meaning they missed at least 10% of the school year.
That represents about 12 million children in the 42 states and
Washington, D.C., where data is available.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, only 15% of students missed that much
school.</p>
<p>Society may have largely moved on from COVID, but schools say they’re
still battling the effects of pandemic school closures. After as much as
a year at home, school for many kids has felt overwhelming, boring or
socially stressful. More than ever, kids and parents are deciding it’s
OK to stay home, which makes catching up even harder.</p>
<p>In all but one state, Arkansas, absence rates remain higher than
pre-pandemic. Still, the problem appears to have passed its peak; almost
every state saw absenteeism improve at least slightly from 2021-22 to
2022-23.</p>
<p>Schools are working to identify students with slipping attendance,
then providing help. They’re working to close communication gaps with
parents, who often aren’t aware their child is missing so much school or
why it’s problematic.</p>
<p>So far, the solutions that appear to be helping are simple — like
postcards to parents that compare a child’s attendance with peers. But
to make more progress, experts say, schools must get creative to address
their students’ needs.</p>
<p>Caring adults — and incentives</p>
<p>In Oakland, California, chronic absenteeism skyrocketed from 29%
pre-pandemic to 53% in 2022-23 across district and charter schools.
Officials asked students what would convince them to come to class.</p>
<p>Money, they replied, and a mentor.</p>
<p>A grant-funded program launched in spring 2023 paid 45 students $50
weekly for perfect attendance. Students also checked in daily with an
assigned adult and completed weekly mental health assessments.</p>
<p>Paying students isn’t a permanent or sustainable fix, said Zaia Vera,
the district’s head of social-emotional learning.</p>
<p>But many absent students lacked stable housing or were helping to
support their families. “The money is the hook that got them in the
door,” Vera said.</p>
<p>More than 60% improved their attendance after taking part, Vera said.
The program is expected to continue, along with district-wide efforts
aimed at creating a sense of belonging. Oakland’s African American Male
Achievement project, for example, pairs Black students with Black
teachers who offer support.</p>
<p>Kids who identify with their educators are more likely to attend
school, said Michael Gottfried, a University of Pennsylvania professor.
According to one study led by Gottfried, California students felt “it’s
important for me to see someone who’s like me early on, first thing in
the day,” he said.</p>
<p>A caring teacher made a difference for Golden Tachiquin, 18, who
graduated from Oakland’s Skyline High School this spring. When she
started 10th grade after a remote freshman year, she felt lost and
anxious. She later realized these feelings caused the nausea and
dizziness that kept her home sick. She was absent at least 25 days that
year.</p>
<p>But she bonded with an Afro-Latina teacher who understood her
culturally and made Tachiquin, a straight-A student, feel her poor
attendance didn’t define her.</p>
<p>“I didn’t dread going to her class,” Tachiquin said.</p>
<p>Another teacher had the opposite effect. “She would say, ‘Wow, guess
who decided to come today?’” Tachiquin recalled. “I started skipping her
class even more.”</p>
<p>In Massachusetts, Medford High School requires administrators to
greet and talk with students each morning, especially those with a
history of missing school.</p>
<p>But the lunchtime gym sessions have been the biggest driver of
improved attendance, Principal Marta Cabral said. High schoolers need
freedom and an opportunity to move their bodies, she said. “They’re here
for seven hours a day. They should have a little fun.”</p>
<p>Stubborn circumstances</p>
<p>Chronically absent students are at higher risk of illiteracy and
eventually dropping out. They also miss the meals, counseling and
socialization provided at school.</p>
<p>Many of the reasons kids missed school early in the pandemic are
still firmly in place: financial hardship, transportation problems, mild
illness and mental health struggles.</p>
<p>In Alaska, 45% of students missed significant school last year. In
Amy Lloyd’s high school classes in Juneau, some families now treat
attendance as optional. Last term, several of her English students
missed school for vacations.</p>
<p>“I don’t really know how to reset the expectation that was crushed
when we sat in front of the computer for that year,” Lloyd said.</p>
<p>Emotional and behavioral problems also have kept kids home from
school. Research shared exclusively with AP found absenteeism and poor
mental health are “interconnected,” said University of Southern
California professor Morgan Polikoff.</p>
<p>For example, in the USC study, almost a quarter of chronically absent
kids had high levels of emotional or behavioral problems, according to a
parent questionnaire, compared with just 7% of kids with good
attendance. Emotional symptoms among teen girls were especially linked
with missing school.</p>
<p>How sick is too sick?</p>
<p>When chronic absence surged to around 50% in Fresno, California,
officials realized they had to remedy pandemic-era mindsets about
keeping kids home sick.</p>
<p>“Unless your student has a fever or threw up in the last 24 hours,
you are coming to school. That’s what we want,” said Abigail Arii,
director of student support services.</p>
<p>Often, said Noreida Perez, who oversees attendance, parents aren’t
aware physical symptoms can point to mental health struggles — such as
when a child doesn’t feel up to leaving their bedroom.</p>
<p>More than a dozen states now let students take mental health days as
excused absences. But staying home can become a vicious cycle, said Hedy
Chang, of Attendance Works, which works with schools on absenteeism.</p>
<p>“If you continue to stay home from school, you feel more disengaged,”
she said. “You get farther behind.”</p>
<p>Changing the culture around sick days is only part of the
problem.</p>
<p>At Fresno’s Fort Miller Middle School, where half the students were
chronically absent, two reasons kept coming up: dirty laundry and no
transportation. The school bought a washer and dryer for families’ use,
along with a Chevy Suburban to pick up students who missed the bus.
Overall, Fresno’s chronic absenteeism improved to 35% in 2022-23.</p>
<p>Melinda Gonzalez, 14, missed the school bus about once a week and
would call for rides in the Suburban.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a car; my parents couldn’t drive me to school,”
Gonzalez said. “Getting that ride made a big difference.”</p>
