capital breaks heat record, officials impose water rationing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: San Jose Mercury News</p>
<p>One study found that heat waves have killed more than 24,000 people
in the country since 1992. The increase in heat events in coming years
could threaten India’s development, and risk reversing its progress on
poverty alleviation, health and economic growth, the study said.</p>

<h2
id="us-optimistic-a-deal-to-lessen-threats-of-future-pandemics-is-in-sight">US
optimistic a deal to lessen threats of future pandemics is in sight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Geneva — Despite the failure of negotiators to reach a pandemic
accord ahead of this week’s World Health Assembly, a senior U.S.
official remains optimistic that an agreement to lessen the threats of
global killer disease outbreaks is in sight.</p>
<p>“We think the elements of a good deal are already on the table and
that is why we feel optimistic because those are pretty good deals. It
is just a matter now of fine-tuning it to make sure everybody says we
are ready to sign on the dotted line,” Xavier Becerra, U.S. secretary of
health and human services, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva
Wednesday.</p>
<p>While disappointing, Becerra indicated that it was not surprising
that an accord was not reached after two-and-a-half years of
negotiations.</p>
<p>“Negotiations go on forever,” he said. “I think we have to put this
in perspective. You do not build a nation overnight. You do not build an
Empire State Building overnight. It takes a long time. Name me a major
international achievement that came overnight.</p>
<p>“I think there is clear consensus that we cannot let the status quo
be upon us if another pandemic comes,” he said.</p>
<p>His view reflects that of World Health Organization Director-General
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who, in his opening remarks at the World
Health Assembly on Monday, assured delegates that the negotiations were
on track and were not a failure.</p>
<p>“Of course, we all wish that we had been able to reach a consensus on
the agreement in time for this health assembly and cross the finish
line,” he said. “But I remain confident that you still will—because
where there is a will, there is a way.”</p>
<p>WHO says 7,010,681 people have died from the COVID-19 outbreak as of
April 13 and that a total of 704,753,890 cases have been confirmed in
229 countries and territories.</p>
<p>Becerra noted that threats against global health have an outsized
influence on broader global political and economic interests.</p>
<p>“There is no stability without health. There is no security without
health. Our nations cannot be strong unless they are healthy.</p>
<p>“Getting out of COVID is our main health priority,” Becerra said,
noting that U.S. President Joe Biden was committed to achieving a
pandemic treaty.</p>
<p>“When the president came in, we were experiencing two or three 9/11s
every day in America in terms of loss of life. That is where we started.
Today, we are walking around without masks. We are treating COVID the
way we treat the flu,” he said, indicating that now is not the time to
become complacent.</p>
<p>“I think we realize that another pandemic could be upon us. I mean,
we are dealing with avian flu in the U.S. right now. We do not know how
long it is going to be before we get another type of COVID kind of
tragedy. We do not want to wait,” he said.</p>
<p>Sticking points to a pandemic treaty include disagreements over
sharing information about pathogens that cause pandemics, a formula for
global sharing of vaccines and medicine during international health
emergencies, and financing to set up surveillance systems.</p>
<p>The WHO says that member states have agreed to continue to work
during the World Health Assembly “to develop the world’s first pandemic
accord” to prevent a repeat of the “global health, economic and social
impacts” of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We really have an incredible opportunity this week,” Loyce Pace,
assistant secretary for global affairs at HHS, said.</p>
<p>“We have spent so long trying to come together and finding compromise
and consensus. I think we talk about what is left to do, but I do not
know if we talk enough about what has been done toward reaching an
agreement.”</p>
<p>“So, whatever happens this week, we need some deliverable, if only to
keep this momentum on towards any other work that should continue. We
shouldn’t be leaving Geneva and go home without an accord, not after all
that has been done,” Pace said.</p>
<p>Secretary Becerra agrees, saying that he does not think there are
substantive disagreements about the essential elements of a pandemic
treaty.</p>
<p>“It is more how they are packaged, how they are defined. People
generally agree with what we have to do in order to be ready to take on
any pandemic that may come across our path,” Becerra said.</p>
<p>“I am the son of immigrants. Optimism is in my DNA and so, I believe
we are going to get this done because it would be tragic, especially
given how far we have come and not get it done.</p>
<p>“We have to be ready,” he said. “Who knows what is coming around the
corner. Something is going to broadside us. We just have to be
ready.”</p>

The ACEMAGIC M2A Starship is a gaming PC that looks more like a wireless
router than a typical PC. But with support for up to an Intel Core
i9-12900H processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 30 Series mobile graphics, it
has the guts of a pretty decent gaming laptop from a year or two ago.

<h2 id="bearblog-is-fun">Bearblog is fun</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;If you’re into blogging and the blogging world, chances are you might have heard about &lt;a href=&quot;https://bearblog.dev&quot;&gt;bearblog.dev&lt;/a&gt;. And if you’re a reader of this blog you might have also &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-herman-martinus&quot;&gt;read the interview with Herman&lt;/a&gt;, Bearblog’s creator.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I never used Bearblog, mainly because I’m happy with my setup and I have
no reason to look for another blog solution.
</p>
<p>
That said, a few weeks back I started toying with the idea of porting
the design of this site over to Bear, just for fun. And to my surprise,
creating a bear version of my site was surprisingly simple.
</p>
<p>
Which is why
<a download href="https://manuelmoreale.com/media/pages/thoughts/bearblog-is-fun/8994e049c2-1717000249/bearblog_manu_theme.zip">I’m
happy to release a V0.1 of this experiment</a>. The demo site I’m using
it’s currently up at
<a href="https://css.bearblog.dev">css.bearblog.dev</a>. This is a very
quick and dirty version. There’s some leftover code in there but it
should mostly work.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Quick note: I might use that test site in the future to code other
themes so depending on when you’re reading this post, the live preview
might not actually show the correct theme.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
To install it just head over to the “Themes” section in your dashboard,
delete everything inside the “Edit theme CSS” section and paste in the
code of my theme. Hit “Publish” and you’re done.
</p>
<p>
I’m sure there will be bugs because there are always bugs. If you need
help with anything <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">send me an
email</a>. The theme is free, if you want to contribute the best way to
do it is to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">become a member of

When you buy a stock, your brokerage has to go out and buy it for you.

are now rethinking how to live alongside the increasingly unpredictable
rains. As climate refugees, they join the survivors of other climate
disasters in recent years and the millions more who are expected to
follow in their footsteps over the coming decades. “Brazil is not going
to be a one-off,” Andrew Harper, a senior official at the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees, told <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em>.
“What we are seeing is the start of something that will become more

against EPA Clean Water Act discharge regulations. Lawyers representing
San Francisco argued in their petition that the federal regulations —

rather than setting numerical pollution limits — are too vague. “These
prohibitions effectively tell permit holders nothing more than not to
cause ‘too much’ pollution,” the

to keep permits in line with regional and state discharge standards.

about their stance on “criminal charges being filed against oil and gas
companies to hold them accountable for deaths caused by their

they were opposed. A growing number of states, counties, and cities are

<h2 id="turbo9-a-pipelined-6809-microprocessor-ip">Turbo9: a pipelined
6809 microprocessor IP</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Turbo9 is a pipelined microprocessor IP written in Verilog that
executes a superset of the Motorola 6809 instruction set. It is a new
modern microarchitecture with 16-bit internal datapaths that balances
high performance vs small area / low power. The Turbo9R with a 16-bit
memory interface achieves 0.69 DMIPS/MHz which is 3.8 times faster than
Motorola’s original 8-bit MC6809 implementation. It is an active
graduate research project at the Department of Electrical &amp; Computer
Engineering at the University of Florida. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page The
Turbo9 is aimed at SoC sub-blocks and small mixed-signal ASIC, so it’s
definitely not intended to be some sort of general purpose CPU. The
reason for opting for the 6809 instead of, say, RISC-V or ARM, is that
the 6809 enables a far smaller footprint due to being 16bit, which is
all the target market really needs from the Turbo9. The current version
of the Turbo9 is thoroughly verified and is capable of running C code.
However, we still consider this version v0.9 because we are missing a
few items. All the 6809 instructions and addressing modes have been
implemented and tested except SYNC and CWAI. The signed versions of the
Turbo9’s 16-bit divide and multiply need to be completed. Interrupts are
partially implemented including SWI and Reset. ↫ Turbo9 GitHub page This
is the kind of riveting content you’ll only really find on OSNews.</p>

<p>With five months until the November election and no diplomatic

in 2020 ran on a campaign to end “forever wars,” is shifting voters’
attention away from American entanglements abroad by focusing on
domestic priorities. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has the
story.</p>

agree that killing is wrong?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-29, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
I don’t think it’s possible to morally support the ongoing bombardment
of Gaza, but that’s too weak a statement. What’s happening there seems
to be — based on what I’ve read through the news, what I’ve seen in
video, the stories that have been sent back to us — an atrocity. The
latest story, from Rafah, is of an airstrike on a civilian evacuation
zone where displaced families
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israeli-tanks-enter-central-rafah-palestinians-tent-camp-blaze-rcna154235">were
sheltering in tents</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Images showed the area engulfed in flames as screaming Palestinians fled
for safety, with some video shared on social media showing disturbing
images, including severely burned corpses and a man holding what
appeared to be the headless body of a small child.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There’s nothing flippant to say about this. This isn’t sports, where you
root for a team. It’s not a theoretical debate: certainly not for the
families who have no way to escape, kettled as they are into a small
strip of land under constant military bombardment.
</p>
<p>
The bombardment on Gaza is disproportionate and indefensible.
<a href="https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/more-13000-children-reported-dead-gaza-famine-nears">Thirteen
thousand children alone</a> have been killed. A quarter of surviving
children have acute malnutrition. There’s nowhere for them to go, and
nowhere for them to get the care they need. In the face of these
conditions, there must be a ceasefire. <em>Obviously</em> there must be
a ceasefire.
</p>
<p>
Making statements like this is fraught. It sometimes seems like we’re
being asked to fall into weird ideological lines that have little to do
with the humanity of the people involved. Following the events of
October 7, I unfollowed multiple progressive Instagram accounts that not
only described the attack and kidnappings as the necessary work of
de-colonization, but applauded the action. It’s clear to me that
Palestine has been annexed, its land
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement">illegally
settled</a>, and its people made to suffer at the hands of
increasingly-conservative Israeli policy. Protest and resistance are
inevitable and justifiable. Regardless, I can’t support the killing and
kidnapping of civilians, let alone accept <em>cheerleading</em> for it.
Not ever.
</p>
<p>
By the same token, I see some people online call for an end to the state
of Israel. What would that entail, exactly? Assuming it was a desirable
goal, how might one go about achieving that? Dismantling it would
involve unthinkable bloodshed.
</p>
<p>
Some people talk about how Hamas is the local government, and how the
people there voted for them, so they deserve what’s happening to them.
That it’s okay to bomb hospitals
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/01/middleeast/gaza-hospitals-destruction-investigation-intl-cmd/">because
Hamas is hiding out in them</a> — regardless of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_shield">international law
related to protecting the lives of human shields</a>.
</p>
<p>
The history, today’s political issues, and the road to a solution are
far more complicated than can be conveyed by memes and soundbites. I
have no solutions to the problems in this region or how to get to a
lasting peace.
</p>
<p>
But some things are not complicated at all.
</p>
<p>
Don’t kill. Don’t subjugate. Don’t dehumanize. Don’t reduce lives, in
all their complexity and beauty, to points and sides.
</p>
<p>
The core of this issue right now is — or should be — concern for human
life. Everyone, regardless of nationality or political affiliation,
should be appalled when children burn to death or are decapitated
(whether they’re in an evacuation zone or not). The ruining of cities
should never yield applause.
</p>
<p>
The protests on university campuses are the latest in a long line of
campus anti-war protests, and I’m strongly in favor of them. Except,
because of course this is true, there are people there who conflate the
protest over policy with protests of anyone who is Israeli, or even
anyone who is a Jew. I’ve personally heard stories of at least one
person being spat on, not because of any rhetoric they were espousing,
but simply because of who they were.
</p>
<p>
This all has the potential to escalate. I worry that it will. This is
all already so horrific.
</p>
<p>
These are human beings. The Palestinian people are human beings. The
Israeli people are human beings. Arabs are human beings. Jews are human
beings. They are not their leaders; they are not their circumstances.
They all - like all people - deserve to live, and live well. The death
of any human being is never something to celebrate or to praise as a
strategy. It’s all just endless tragedy.
</p>
<p>
Stop the killing. Find another way.

Carbon Removal Companies Got the Energy Department’s Stamp of
Approval</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjMzNjE3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDQ5NjQ1M30.dIu_LPJWQtlhZ2lCcGm38VxxrhoZBU2dhSdnEw_kTfU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Department of Energy is advancing its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-removal-us-government" target="_self"><u>first-of-a-kind
program </u></a>to stimulate demand for carbon removal by becoming a
major buyer. On Tuesday, the agency awarded $50,000 to each of 24
semifinalist companies competing to suck carbon dioxide out of the
atmosphere on behalf of the U.S. government. It will eventually spend
$30 million to buy carbon removal credits from up to 10 winners.
</p>
<p>
The nascent carbon removal industry is desperate for customers. At a
conference held in New York City last week called Carbon Unbound,
startup CEOs brainstormed how to convince more companies to buy carbon
removal as part of their sustainability strategies. On the sidelines,
attendees lamented to me that there were hardly even any potential
buyers at the conference — <em><em>what a missed opportunity.</em></em>
</p>
<p>
Conference panelists asserted that the industry needed to rebuild trust.
Purchasing carbon credits has become a risky strategy for companies. In
one investigation after another, journalists and researchers have shown
that many of the projects behind these credits fail to produce the
climate benefits they advertise. There’s a
<a href="https://climatecasechart.com/case/berrin-v-delta-air-lines-inc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>class
action lawsuit</u></a> against Delta Air Lines for marketing itself as
“carbon neutral” after purchasing such questionable carbon offsets.
</p>
<p>
Carbon removal credits are technically different from the offsets that
companies bought in the past, which were based on projects that reduce
emissions to the atmosphere rather than remove carbon that’s already
heating the planet. But there’s still a risk of sham projects. And
because the field is relatively new, there’s not yet a set of widely
agreed-upon standards to measure and verify how much carbon is being
removed.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Energy hopes that by selecting 24 companies that have
been vetted by government scientists, it’s sending a signal to the
private sector that there are at least some projects that are
legitimate. “We can’t wait to invest in CDR until those standards have
been codified,” Noah Deich, the agency’s deputy assistant secretary of
carbon management, told me. “We need to invest now so that we actually
get the data that we can use to inform the standards, and then over time
codify those standards and strengthen and improve them.”
</p>
<p>
The semifinalists represent a wide range of carbon removal methods. Nine
of the companies are building machines that capture carbon dioxide
directly from the air. Seven take advantage of the natural ability of
plants and algae to suck up carbon, and have developed systems to
sequester that carbon for far longer than would otherwise occur. Five
employ rocks that naturally absorb carbon and have figured out how to
speed up the process. The last three capture carbon from the ocean,
enabling the world’s biggest carbon sink to draw down more from the
atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
To proceed to the final round, all of these companies will have to draw
up contracts that say how quickly they will be able to remove the
promised tons of carbon, and who they will work with to measure and
verify the process.
</p>
<p>
The Biden administration is spending billions on research, development,
and deployment of carbon removal. Some of the semifinalists, like
Climeworks, Heirloom Carbon, and 1PointFive, were already selected for
grants from the DOE to build the U.S.’s first “direct air capture hubs”
— projects capable of removing one million tons of carbon from the air
per year. But those hubs will fail if the companies don’t ultimately
find buyers for their carbon removal. “Every single CDR project that
we’re seeing today requires some sort of voluntary credit sale to be
profitable,” said Deich.
</p>
<p>
The Department of Energy’s $30 million budget to buy carbon removal is
relatively small. The semifinalists said they could deliver a wide range
of credits with their share of the funds, from 3,000 over a three-year
period, to more than 30,000. In any case, DOE is unlikely to afford much
more than 100,000 tons of carbon taken out of the atmosphere, equivalent
to about 0.002% of the CO2 the United States emitted in 2022. When
distributed among 10 companies, it’s certainly not enough to finance a
project. But Deich told me he sees this contest as a public-private
partnership. The agency is challenging the semifinalists to leverage the
DOE’s recognition to try and sell as many credits as they can. It’s one
of the criteria they’ll be judged on for the final phase of the contest.
</p>
<p>
Several semifinalists I spoke with were optimistic the DOE’s backing
would help. “One of the things that the private sector is wrestling with
is the technical underwriting of various carbon dioxide removal
technologies,” Barclay Rogers, the CEO of the carbon removal company
Graphyte, told me. Graphyte’s process almost sounds too simple to work.
The company takes discarded plant matter from forests and fields, dries
it out so that it doesn’t decompose, compresses it into bricks, and then
buries them. Graphyte has already built a small processing facility in
Arkansas and secured a burial site that could store an estimated 1.5
million tons of CO2. Rogers was excited to have DOE’s backing as “a
broad signal to the market of the viability of Graphyte’s carbon casting
process.”
</p>
<p>
Others were grateful that the government was branching out to new
technologies. To date, most of the DOE’s carbon removal programs have
supported direct air capture. Companies working on other approaches have
been shut out of funding opportunities, and some worry that this has
contributed to a perception among buyers that direct air capture is the
only valid method. “We think this is a huge step forward, since it’s
really the first time not only that the U.S. government is going to
become a purchaser of carbon removal, but also funding a full range of
carbon removal solutions,” Nora Cohen Brown, head of market development
and policy at Charm Industrial, told me. (Charm also buries plant waste
underground, but in the form of oil.) “We really think that biomass CDR
has immense potential,” she said. “It’s a big deal to have DOE’s
blessing for that pathway.”
</p>
<p>
Edward Sanders, the chief operating officer of a startup called Equatic,
told me that being a semifinalist meant the company would be able to
build a plant in the U.S. much sooner than it initially planned. Equatic
has developed technology to remove carbon from seawater, enabling the
ocean to take up more carbon. It’s currently building its first
large-scale plant in Singapore. “This tells prospective future buyers
that there is a role to play in the near term in the U.S. for a
marine-based pathway.”
</p>
<p>
Many of the companies on the list, including the three I just mentioned,
have already been relatively successful in selling credits. Graphyte
sold 10,000 to American Airlines. Equatic has a 62,000 deal with Boeing.
Charm will remove more than 100,000 tons for Frontier Climate, a group
of buyers that includes Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, and Meta. But even
though a handful of tech companies and airlines are buying carbon
removal, these sweeping gestures are not enough to sustain the industry,
let alone grow it to the scale that scientists say will be necessary to
halt climate change.
</p>
<p>
DOE’s purchase may help increase confidence in some of these companies
and approaches, but it may not do much to solve another problem: There’s
little incentive for anyone to pay for carbon removal today, and it’s
much more expensive than other options companies have to reduce their
emissions. Credits can cost between several hundred to more than a
thousand dollars each.
</p>
<p>
Deich said the agency was trying to set an example for other buyers.
Instead of creating a net-zero target and searching for the cheapest
credits to accomplish its goal, it’s prioritizing quality and only
buying what it can afford. “We need to pay what it costs,” he said, “and
then developers can develop projects and figure out how to do it cheaper
so that over time, it starts to come down the cost curve significantly,
and we can buy larger and larger quantities.”
</p>
<p id="semifinalists">
But this is only the near term plan to help the industry mature.
Ultimately, Deich doesn’t think that the voluntary trade of credits will
be enough to support the levels of carbon removal that will make a
difference in climate change. He sees this purchase prize program as a
way to start building the government’s capacity to play a larger role.
“There’s going to need to be some sort of mandate or public procurement
that happens for the field to really scale beyond 2030,” he said.

parliament overrides veto of controversial foreign agent law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tbilisi, Georgia — Georgia’s parliament on Tuesday overrode the
president’s veto of a controversial foreign agent law, despite protests
at home and criticism in Western capitals, including a U.S. threat to
impose sanctions.</p>
<p>The new measure is officially called the “Law on Transparency of
Foreign Influence.” However, opponents have dubbed it the “Russian law,”
a reference to Russia’s foreign agent law, which requires anyone who
receives support from outside Russia, or is seen as acting under
“foreign influence,” to register as a foreign agent. </p>
<p>“I was watching the live broadcast of the vote with my mother. Till
the last moment, we still had a hope. We hoped that their consciences
wouldn’t allow it. But it happened, and I am really saddened. However,
what gives me hope are the demonstrators,” said Nana Jikia, a student.
“We want European future; we do not want to be a Russian province.”</p>
<p>The Georgian law requires civil society organizations, media and
other entities receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to
register as agents of foreign interests. The law primarily targets U.S.
and European Union democracy assistance programs.</p>
<p>President Salome Zourabichvili vetoed the legislation on May 18, but
it was widely expected that the ruling Georgian Dream party’s
parliamentary majority would override the veto.</p>
<p>“There’s only one way forward for Georgia. For its sovereignty and
freedom and liberty, and that is to remove this government
democratically through next elections, to continue this protest, to have
an overwhelming moral majority and, like 30 years ago in 1990 when
communists were defeated even before elections, they have to accept that
they have to give up power,” Giga Bokeria, head of the opposition
European Georgia party, told VOA.</p>
<p>Georgian Dream reintroduced the law in April, a year after it
abandoned in March 2023 after it sparked mass protests.</p>
<p>Protesters view the law as a move by the government to tilt the
country toward Moscow, even though polls show more than 80% of Georgians
support Georgia’s path toward EU membership and 73% endorse the
country’s bid to join NATO.</p>
<p>General elections in October will determine whether the Georgian
Dream party remains in power for a fourth term. Georgian nongovernmental
organizations say the foreign agent law may hinder international
organizations’ ability to observe the October vote. While the government
claims the law promotes transparency, local NGOs and Georgia’s Western
partners view it as targeting Western funding for Georgian civil
society.</p>
<p>“Having no chances of victory in the upcoming general elections in
October if they are conducted freely and fairly, [Bidzina] Ivanishvili”
— Georgian Dream’s shadow leader — “is tightening his grip on power
through harsh authoritarian measures and is openly driving the country
into Russian influence,” former Georgian ambassador to the United States
David Sikharulidze told VOA outside the parliament building in
Tbilisi.</p>
<p>“It’s very much in line with Putin’s tactics,” he said.</p>
<p>“This law is a Russian law in essence and spirit, which contradicts
our constitution and all European standards,” Zourabichvili said in her
veto statement.</p>
<p>Zourabichvili, whose election as president in 2018 was supported by
Georgian Dream, has increasingly found herself at odds with the
party.</p>
<p>Apprehension over the domestic and foreign policy trajectory of
Georgia’s government has grown since Russia launched its full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Official Tbilisi refused to side
with Ukraine publicly or to join sanctions against Moscow, while
attacking Ukrainian officials publicly and echoing anti-Western
rhetoric.</p>
<p>In addition, U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about Georgia’s role
in helping Russia evade Western sanctions.</p>
<p>For more than a month and a half, tens of thousands of Georgians have
taken to the streets to protest the foreign agent law, the largest
protests the country has seen since it gained independence from the
Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>“Georgian people have erupted in protest. They deserve more than just
statements from the Western partners,” Sikharulidze said.</p>
<p>Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced sanctions
against those “responsible for undermining democracy in Georgia.”</p>
<p>“The Department of State is implementing a new visa restriction
policy for Georgia that will apply to individuals who are responsible
for or complicit in undermining democracy in Georgia, as well as their
family members,” Blinken said in a statement. “This includes individuals
responsible for suppressing civil society and freedom of peaceful
assembly in Georgia through a campaign of violence or intimidation.”</p>
<p>Georgian Dream officials dismissed the visa restrictions as
interference in Georgia’s internal affairs.</p>
<p>“The blackmail with visa restrictions are nothing but a crude attempt
to limit the independence and sovereignty of Georgia,” the Georgian
Dream party said in a statement, labeling the move “anti-Georgian.”</p>
<p>For their part, European Union officials have warned that adopting
the foreign agent law would jeopardize Georgia’s bid for EU
membership.</p>
<p>“The law of foreign influence is not in line with EU values. If the
law is enacted, it will impact Georgia’s EU path,” said EU foreign
policy chief Josep Borrell.</p>
<p>Georgian officials have dismissed the critical voices in Washington
and Brussels as part of what they call the “Global War Party,” which one
Georgian Dream MP described to a British podcaster as a “’force akin to
the Freemasons.”</p>

<h2 id="jef-raskins-canon-cat">Jef Raskin’s Canon Cat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Few things in technology excites me more than an amazing computer I
have never heard of before – especially one with pedigree. Many people
take a casual glance at this machine and say, “Isn’t that an overgrown
word processor?” And one could certainly think so, in part because of
its keyboard-centric operation, but mostly from the utterly
uncomprehending way Canon advertised it in 1987. Canon dubbed the Cat a
“work processor” because of its built-in telecommunications, modem and
word processor even though Jef Raskin, its designer, had intended it as
a “people’s computer” that could be inexpensive, accessible and fully
functional — all things he had hoped to accomplish at Apple after first
launching the Macintosh project, prior to departing in 1982. Canon,
however, never fully grasped the concept either. Apart from the
tone-deaf marketing, Canon sold the device through their typewriter
division and required the display to only show what a daisywheel printer
could generate, limiting its potential as a general purpose workstation.
↫ Cameron Kaiser Wait, wait, wait. You mean to tell me there’s a unique,
well-designed computer that seemed ahead of its time, sold by a printer
and copier company, that failed in the market due to botched marketing
and grotesque misunderstanding among management of what the device is
supposed to be? What are the odds this happens twice? The Canon Cat was
designed and built by Jeff Raskin’s – of Macintosh fame – company
Information Appliance, Inc., and licensed to Canon. It’s an all-in-one
68000-based computer with a bitmap display, an operating system stored
in ROM, and a comprehensive Forth environment easily accessible despite
the device autostarting to a word processor (because Canon). Much like
some of the predecessor machines Raskin had worked on before licensing
the Cat to Canon, the Cat has an intriguing input method that I’d never
seen before. Instead of a mouse or even cursor keys, it has two keys
labeled “Leap” that are used for manipulating the text cursor. In fact,
there aren’t even conventional cursor keys. The Cat has the same “leap”
keys as the Swyft and SwyftCard, in a bright but tasteful pink, and they
work the same way to jump to portions of the document or into other
documents. You can also use them to scroll with the SHIFT key, or move
by single letters, sentences or paragraphs. The LEAP keys are also how
you highlight text blocks to manipulate by LEAPing to the beginning,
LEAPing to the end, and then pressing them together. ↫ Cameron Kaiser
The Forth programming environment is also very interesting. It was
hidden in that Canon didn’t really want you to use it, but Raskin’s
company made no secret of it, and it was easily accessible. It uses a
special dialect of Forth, which can be used at either a traditional OK
prompt, or just by typing Forth code into the word processor,
highlighting it, and executing it with a keyboard shortcut, after which
any output will be displayed in the word processor as well. The Canon
Cat was a market failure, and hence it shouldn’t be a surprise it’s
exceedingly rare. The article further details the internals, some fixes
that were required and performed, and much, much more. A follow-up
article will delve deeper into the software, too.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Aside from that, the company also announced Windows 11 IoT Enterprise
LTSC 2024 this week. The company has also published the minimum system
requirements as well as supported processor families. They have been
categorized as Preferred and Optional. Interestingly, SSD has been added
as a minimum system requirement, which has been a rumour about the
client OS since mid-2022. ↫ Sayan Sen at NeoWin The LTSC release, which
is not really supposed to be used by average consumers, is still
remarkably popular. It contains a fixed feature set and gets far fewer
updates than regular Windows releases, it omits otherwise stock
applications like Edge, and gives its users far more control over which
updates are and are not installed. LTSC also enjoys 10 years of support
from Microsoft. Interestingly enough, the minimum specifications for the
IoT version of LTSC do not require a TPM 2.0, unlike the regular version
of Windows, which infamously does require one. I would assume that the
“preferred” minimum requirements, which does require TPM 2.0, line up
very well with the minimum requirements for the regular LTSC version of
Windows 11. Both will become available later this year, alongside the
regular release of Windows 11 24H2.</p>

<h2 id="tom-steyer-is-baffled-by-warren-buffetts-oil-bets">Tom Steyer Is
Baffled By Warren Buffett’s Oil Bets</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjMzNDUwNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzAwMjY0OH0.4P2clRlAiERUniJCJOnkLA0aLX85AzOMLoRzBcZVnEk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
If you’re looking for a relatively optimistic read on the fight against
climate change, Tom Steyer’s new book is out today. Called
<em><em>Cheaper, Better Faster: How We’ll Win the Climate War</em></em>,
it dives into the billionaire’s perspective on the state of the climate
crisis and the clean energy solutions helping the world decarbonize.
Steyer’s perspective is informed by the many hats he wears — investor,
philanthropist, long shot 2020 presidential candidate, Yale man, and
co-founder of the investment firm Galvanize Climate Solutions.
</p>
<p>
I chatted with Steyer a few weeks ago about his book, his guiding
investment principles, and how and why people become environmentalists.
Here are three things I found noteworthy<strong>:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong></strong><strong>1. Steyer thinks Warren Buffett is making a bad
bet.</strong>
</p>
<p>
While Steyer admits that “no one’s ever gotten rich betting against
Warren Buffett,” he believes the billionaire investor has got it wrong
when it comes to oil and gas investments. Buffett’s firm, Berkshire
Hathaway, has a 28% stake in Occidental Petroleum and a nearly 7% stake
in Chevron.
</p>
<p>
“Of the 8 billion people alive today, it’s possible that no one is
better than Warren at predicting the future of commercial activity,”
Steyer writes in his book. “But in the case of fossil fuels, he doesn’t
seem to recognize how quickly our ability to develop and deploy clean
energy is growing — and how cheap that energy is becoming.”
</p>
<p>
“He has generally been a very high minded, good guy,” Steyer told me.
“[But] I look at these investments, and I don’t understand how those
reserves can get developed without pushing us to a place from a climate
standpoint that is unsupportable … Every scenario like that puts us in a
climate bind.”
</p>
<p>
Steyer ultimately likens investing in fossil fuels to betting on whale
oil, a fuel that powered lamps in the 18th and 19th centuries. “We
should not be rooting to keep the whale blubber business going and
spending a lot of American tax dollars to support whale blubber. Because
it turns out, that’s not the future. It’s really important for America
that we be at the forefront of economic change.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Galvanize Climate Solutions is more than a VC firm.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Steyer co-founded the climate investment firm Galvanize in 2021 with
fellow investor Katie Hall. Last September,
<a href="https://galvanizeclimate.com/news/galvanize-climate-solutions-closes-first-venture-and-growth-equity-fund/" target="_blank"><u>the
firm announced that it had raised over $1 billion</u></a> for its first
fund, which targets investments in early to growth stage climate
companies “that can drive meaningful decarbonization over the next
decade,” according to Saloni Multani, co-head of the fund.
</p>
<p>
What helps set the firm apart is its variety of funding strategies. It
not only makes venture capital investments in early stage companies, but
growth equity investments to help companies reach scale, public equity
investments (that is, purchasing stock) in publicly traded corporations,
and
<a href="https://galvanizeclimate.com/investment-strategies/real-estate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>even
real estate investments</u></a>. Last month Galvanize
<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240426030631/en/Galvanize-Real-Estate-Acquires-First-Asset-in-Pioneering-Profitable-Decarbonization-Strategy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>purchased
its first building</u></a>, an industrial facility in the
Baltimore-Washington corridor that the firm aims to decarbonize via
rooftop solar, mechanical upgrades, and other energy efficiency
measures. The firm also plans to invest in and decarbonize apartment
buildings, student housing, and storage facilities.
</p>
<p>
“We want to buy buildings and make them net zero and prove you can make
more money doing it. We want to be in the early stage companies that are
leading the tech revolutions. We want to actually be a partner in the
public domain, owning stock and partnering with the corporate leaders,
the CEO, the C suite,” Steyer told me. “So it’s an actual activist
strategy, but as partners to the organizations that are trying to lead
the revolution, not as opponents.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. The path to sustainability runs through economic self
interest.</strong>
</p>
<p>
When I asked Steyer to what degree he’s been able to mobilize his
friends and fellow billionaires to get onboard with the climate cause,
he didn’t exactly say it’s been a rousing success. Instead, he
emphasized that people end up making sustainable choices for a variety
of reasons – and that it often starts with economic practicalities
rather than climate consciousness.
</p>
<p>
“A lot of people think that you are an environmentalist, and then you
put solar on your roof. But actually, I think you put solar on your
roof, and then you become an environmentalist,” Steyer said. “I think
getting in the game actually changes people’s attitudes.”
</p>
<p>
This ladders up to statewide politics around renewables as well, he
said. “So if you think about a state where the elected officials have
been very outspoken against renewables and climate response, it would be
Texas. But if you look at Texas, they’ve tripled the amount of solar
they have over the last three years. It’s expected to go up 35% more
this year. They’re by far the biggest wind generator in the country.
They’re not being nice. It’s a good deal.”

denies request to restrict Trump statements about law enforcement in
classified records case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The judge overseeing Donald Trump’s classified documents
case in Florida on Tuesday denied prosecutors’ request to bar the former
president from making public statements that could endanger law
enforcement agents participating in the prosecution. </p>
<p>Prosecutors had told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that the
restriction was necessary to protect law enforcement from potential
threats and harassment after the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee baselessly claimed that the Biden administration wanted to kill
him during a search of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida,
nearly two years ago. </p>
<p>Cannon chided prosecutors in her order denying their request, saying
they didn’t give defense lawyers adequate time to discuss the matter
before it was filed Friday evening. The judge warned prosecutors that
failing to comply with court requirements in the future may lead to
sanctions. She denied the request without prejudice, meaning prosecutors
could file it again. </p>
<p>A spokesperson for special counsel Jack Smith’s team declined to
comment Tuesday. </p>
<p>The decision came as Trump’s lawyers were delivering their closing
arguments at trial in another criminal case against Trump in New York
stemming from a hush money payment to a porn actor during the 2016
presidential campaign. </p>
<p>It’s the latest example of bitterness between Cannon, who was
nominated to the bench by Trump, and prosecutors who have accused the
former president of illegally hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate
classified documents that he took with him after he left the White House
in 2021 and then obstructing the FBI’s efforts to get them back. Trump
has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Cannon has repeatedly chided prosecutors both in hearings and in
court papers over a number of matters, including telling Smith’s team
during one hearing that they were “wasting the court’s time.”
Prosecutors have also signaled their frustration with Cannon’s rulings,
saying in one recent court filing that a request from the judge was
based on a “fundamentally flawed legal premise.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors’ request followed a distorted claim by Trump earlier this
week that the FBI agents who searched his Mar-a-Lago estate in August
2022 were “authorized to shoot me” and were “locked &amp; loaded ready
to take me out &amp; put my family in danger.” </p>
<p>The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was referring to the
disclosure in a court document that the FBI, during the search in Palm
Beach, Florida, followed a standard use-of-force policy that prohibits
the use of deadly force except when the officer conducting the search
has a reasonable belief that the “subject of such force poses an
imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to
another person.” </p>
<p>Prosecutors said in court papers late Friday that Trump’s false
suggestion that federal agents “were complicit in a plot to assassinate
him” expose law enforcement officers “to the risk of threats, violence,
and harassment.” They had urged the judge to bar Trump from making any
comments that “pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to
law enforcement agents” participating in the case. </p>
<p>Defense attorneys in a court filing late Monday called prosecutors’
proposed restriction on Trump’s speech “unconstitutional” and noted that
the identities of law enforcement officers in the case are subject to a
protective order preventing their public release. Defense attorneys said
they asked Smith’s team on Friday if the two sides could meet on Monday
before prosecutors submit their request to give the defense time to
discuss it with Trump. </p>
<p>But prosecutor David Harbach said the situation needed to be
addressed urgently, saying in an email to the defense that Trump created
a situation that “necessitated a prompt request for relief that could
not wait the weekend to file.” They told the judge in their filing late
Friday while Trump’s lawyers didn’t believe there is any “imminent
danger,” Trump had continued that day to make false statements “smearing
and endangering the agents who executed the search.” </p>
<p>A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign, Steven Cheung, said in a
statement Tuesday that “the entire documents case was a political sham
from the very beginning and it should be thrown out entirely.” </p>
<p>It’s among four criminal cases Trump is confronting as he seeks to
reclaim the White House, but outside of the ongoing New York hush money
prosecution, it’s unclear that any of the other three will reach trial
before the November election. </p>
<p>Trump has already had restrictions placed on his speech in two of the
other cases over incendiary comments officials say threaten the
integrity of the prosecutions. </p>
<p>In the New York case, Trump has been fined and threatened with jail
time for repeatedly violating a gag order that bars him from making
public statements about witnesses, jurors and some others connected to
the matter. </p>
<p>He’s also subject to a gag order in his federal criminal election
interference case in Washington. That order limits what he can say about
witnesses, lawyers in the case and court staff, though an appeals court
freed him to speak about special counsel Smith, who brought the
case.</p>

“While young Taiwanese users discuss everything from relationships to
celebrity gossip on Threads, the app has gradually become a gathering
space for progressives, who favor independence from China to defend the
island’s democracy.”
</p>
<p>
Threads has an official stance of not promoting political use. This is
an example, though, of how any social platform will be political whether
you want it to be or not - and therefore how the challenges and
responsibilities surrounding that speech will present themselves
regardless of whether you want them to.
</p>
<p>
I think there’s no alternative: every mass social platform must assume
that it will host political content from vulnerable groups (as well as
powerful ones) and staff up appropriately.

<h2 id="consumption-to-creation-ratio">Consumption-to-creation
ratio</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;You&#39;re currently reading this post either in your RSS feed, in your inbox, or in your browser. You are consuming content. Consuming content is what the majority of the people do most of the time online.  But what&#39;s the ideal ratio between consuming and creating content? I&#39;d argue that a 100/0 split in favour of consumption is not ideal the same way a 0/100 also isn&#39;t. You need to consume at least some content in order to help your ideas evolve.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
I posted 429 times on this site since January 1st, 2017. That’s 429
posts in 2704 days or one every roughly 6 days. How many posts have I
read in that same time span? Let’s be conservative and assume I read 5
blog posts a day. That’s more than 13500 blog posts and would put my
consumption to creation ratio at around 97/3 which doesn’t sound that
much different than 100/0 but the actual, practical difference is huge.
The difference is a blog with 429 posts in 7 and a half years.
</p>
<p>
Could that ratio be better? In theory yeah but how much better? Let’s
imagine I was posting once a day, every day. That would put my ratio at
around 85/15. In order to go below that I’d either need to consume less
content or I’d have to post more than once a day which, on a personal
blog, it’s completely unreasonable unless you treat your blog as a
Twitter/Instagram replacement and that’s not my case.
</p>
<p>
That 97/3 split, as I said, comes out of the very conservative
assumption that I consume 5 posts a day. It doesn’t take into
consideration everything else I might consume: books, audio content,
movies. If I were to factor in all that consumption I’d bet that my
ratio is probably more close to 99/1 which sounds wrong but it really
isn’t when you stop to think about it.
</p>
<p>
I believe people should consume less content and produce more. Finding
an output for creativity is important. But it’s unreasonable to expect
people to stop consuming content and replace that consumption with
creation because the ratio will always be inevitably skewed towards
consumption. And that’s ok. If you’re not a creative person, if you find
hating yourself because you consume too much content and not create
enough, embrace the fact that even a very tiny improvement, from 100/1
to 99.9/0.1 can mean a lot. It’s the difference between letting your
blog die and posting something a couple of times a year. Which is a
substantial difference if you ask me!
</p>
<p>
Also, while I’m here talking about ratios, it’s important to acknowledge
the fact that not everyone can be creative in the same way. I often
write that everyone should ditch social media and start blogging but the
reality is that most people on social media are lurkers and for a lurker
there’s no point in having a blog. But, what you can do, is to engage
with the people who do blog. Send them an email, let them know that you
silently consume what they create, support what they do via tiny
donations. It goes a long way.

id="us-announces-measures-to-help-over-11000-cuban-small-businesses">US
announces measures to help over 11,000 Cuban small businesses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States announced regulatory changes on
Tuesday to increase support for the Cuban people and independent private
sector entrepreneurs. The changes will enable more U.S. financial
support for small private businesses in Cuba, enhance internet-based
services on the island and broaden access to financial services.</p>
<p>The new U.S. measures come as the communist-run island faces a social
and economic crisis, including severe shortages of food, fuel,
electricity and medicine.</p>
<p>A senior administration official stated that the new authorization
allows Cuba’s independent private sector entrepreneurs to open and
remotely access U.S. bank accounts, including through U.S. online
payment platforms.</p>
<p>As of 2021, Cuban entrepreneurs can establish small and medium
private enterprises under Cuban law. By the latest count, there are over
11,000 registered private businesses in Cuba.</p>
<p>“It’s important to note that the new definition for independent
private sector entrepreneurship excludes prohibited officials of the
Cuban government, such as National Assembly members, Cuban military
officers, certain ministry staff, regime propagandists and prohibited
members of the Cuban Communist Party,” the senior official told
reporters during a briefing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>New U.S. regulatory measures will benefit the Cuban people while
continuing to minimize resources to the Cuban government, said another
senior official in President Joe Biden’s administration.</p>
<p>“We believe that the growth of an independent entrepreneurial private
sector in Cuba is fully aligned with our values and is the best hope for
generating economic development and employment in Cuba,” said the senior
official.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department said that Tuesday’s regulatory changes will
allow Cuban nationals to open, maintain and remotely use U.S. bank
accounts, including through online payment platforms, to conduct
authorized or exempt transactions, whether the independent private
sector entrepreneur is physically located in the United States, Cuba or
another country.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the U.S. removed Cuba from its list of countries
“not cooperating fully” in the fight against terrorism. However, Cuba
remains on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list.</p>
<p>The cooperation against terrorism list, which the State Department is
required by law to provide to Congress, is not the same as the State
Sponsors of Terrorism list.</p>
<p>U.S. officials declined to comment on whether the State Department
has begun a formal review of Cuba’s presence on the State Sponsors of
Terrorism list. U.S. sanctions against the Cuban government, its
military intelligence and security services remain in place.</p>

Floods Are Contributing to Pregnancy Loss in India</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjMxMTI3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNzk3MzQ5NH0.S1k4L4SM3tYuGPd0j0psnvk4RW5Ecd3OmjtCvMJF4lg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Ashwini Khandekar was in her first few months of pregnancy when the
flood came. This was July 2021, the peak of the annual monsoon season,
when a downpour destroyed more than 300 houses in Ganeshwadi, a village
400 kilometers south of Mumbai in India’s Maharashtra state. Authorities
instructed Khandekar and her husband to evacuate, she told me, “but I
couldn’t leave my house because all the evacuation centers were full. I
had nowhere to go.” Though in the end her home was spared, for the next
15 days, Khandekar lived in constant fear, praying until the waters
finally abated.
</p>
<p>
Four months later, Khandekar went to the doctor for a prenatal checkup.
Her child, she learned, showed signs of anencephaly, a condition in
which the fetal brain and skull fail to develop normally. Usually,
babies born with anencephaly die within a few hours, and most
pregnancies end in miscarriage. To cross-check the doctor’s claims,
Khandekar visited eight more hospitals. Everyone confirmed the same. “I
was heartbroken,” she said.
</p>
<p>
When a community health-care worker, Kavita Magdum, examined Khandekar’s
medical records, she found that Khandekar had suffered from a severe
deficiency of iron and folic acid, a known
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/anencephaly.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>risk
factor for anencephaly</u></a>. This, in turn, pointed back to the
storm. “She was traumatized by the flood and wasn’t getting a
nutrient-rich diet for several weeks,” Magdum told me. The roads in and
out of the village were closed for 20 days, cutting off food supplies.
During this time, she ate only cooked rice and wheat flatbread.
Sometimes she didn’t eat at all.
</p>
<p>
By the end of December, a month after she learned of her child’s
condition, Khandekar had lost the pregnancy. She was 20 years old at the
time.
</p>
<p>
Though tragic, stories like Khandekar’s are not rare. A research paper
published in <em><em>Nature</em></em> this year found that from 2010 to
2020, maternal exposure to floods led to an average of
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44508-0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>107,888
lost pregnancies</u></a> per year in low- and middle-income countries,
with South Asia reporting the most cases. Lack of access to
nutrient-rich foods was one of the causes the researchers identified,
along with physical and mental stress, disease, and lack of housing and
safe childbirth services.
</p>
<p>
This year’s monsoon season will begin in June and stretch through
September. The Indian Government has
<a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/india/story/rainfall-prediction-india-likely-to-receive-above-average-monsoon-in-2024-says-govt-429659-2024-05-15#:~:text=Rainfall%20prediction%3A%20India%20is%20expected,are%20currently%20reeling%20under%20heatwave." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>forecast</u></a>
above-average rainfall this year, at 106% of the long-term average. In
the first two decades of this century, floods impacted
<a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/files/74124_humancostofdisasters20002019reportu.pdf?startDownload=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>1.5
billion</u></a> people in Asia, accounting for 93% of the globally
affected population. Last year, over
<a href="https://library.wmo.int/records/item/68890-state-of-the-climate-in-asia-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>80%
</u></a>of hydrometeorological disasters in Asia were floods and storms.
</p>
<p>
About
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30727-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>89%</u></a>
of the world’s flood-exposed population resides in low- and
middle-income countries that lack adequate health-care facilities. India
alone has more than
<a href="https://platform.who.int/data/maternal-newborn-child-adolescent-ageing/indicator-explorer-new/MCA/women-of-reproductive-age-(15-49-years)-population-(thousands)" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>378
million</u></a> women of childbearing age, and has experienced an
average of <u>17 yearly flood events</u> in the past two decades. Floods
affected more than
<a href="https://cwc.gov.in/sites/default/files/flood-damage-data-merged.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>218
million</u></a> people in India from 2015 to 2020, and destroyed crops
on nearly
<a href="https://cwc.gov.in/sites/default/files/flood-damage-data-merged.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>35
million hectares</u></a> of farmland, leading to rampant food
insecurity. During this time, stillbirths in India increased
<a href="https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-023-05470-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>28.6%</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
For women and their children, the risk begins even before a pregnancy
occurs. Simran Jamadar was also 20 years old and living in Maharashtra’s
tiny Kanwad village when the floods arrived in 2021. “The water was at
least four feet in our house at 5 p.m.,” said Jamadar, forcing her to
evacuate. Walking through muddy water with her family to the evacuation
center 10 kilometers away, she had to tread carefully lest she disturb
an unseen snake. After she reached her destination, she spent 12 days
crammed in with 6,000 people from 15 villages. Overstressed and
underslept, Jamadar found it difficult to eat. On top of everything
else, the experience brought up painful memories from just over a year
before, when another flood had wiped out her home, along with all its
furniture, crucial papers, and six months of food supplies.
</p>
<p>
Five months later, still grappling with the trauma of the flood, Jamadar
became pregnant. At about the seven-month mark, she experienced a sudden
and unbearable stomachache and vomited. Sonography reports showed that
she had developed an incompetent cervix — a weakened womb unable to hold
a baby. Six hours later, Jamadar gave birth. The child was born and
“passed away within a day,” Anita Kamble, a community health-care worker
from Jamadar’s village, told me.
</p>
<p>
Kamble spoke to more than 30 community health-care workers from the
flood-affected villages and found a similar pattern of stillbirths
associated with stress — even when that stress began before the women
became pregnant. This squares with other findings from the
<em><em>Nature</em></em> study, which showed a significant association
between pregnancy loss and exposure to floods even six months before
conception. A controlled
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4714539/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
of 340 women from Sweden who’d been pregnant in the same year found that
54% of those who experienced stress during pregnancy such as depression
or anxiety gave birth prematurely.
</p>
<p>
With flooding, disruptions and their attending stressors can last for
months, and sometimes even years. “The trauma was visible on her face,”
Kamble said of Jamadar.
</p>
<p>
“The most important buffer for stressed pregnant women is social
support,” Gloria Giarratano, a professor of nursing at Louisiana State
University Health Sciences Center, told me. That includes resources to
help cope with psychiatric stressors. Giarratano was the lead author of
a study of women in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina, which
<u><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07399332.2018.1535600" target="_blank">found</a></u>
that women without a network of trusted people to rely on were the most
likely to become depressed while pregnant. The more support they have,
Giarratano told me, the more that risk decreases.
</p>
<p>
India, however, for its population of 1.3 billion people, has just
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6482705/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>9,000
psychiatrists and 1,000 psychologists</u></a>. In the face of this
challenge, community health-care workers like Magdum and Kamble have
devised ad hoc solutions.
</p>
<p>
What India lacks in licensed medical practitioners, it somewhat makes up
for in community-based health programs. India has over a
<a href="https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1606212" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>million</u></a>
all-women community health-care workers, known as Accredited Social
Health Activists, or ASHAs, who make public health care accessible.
Appointed for every 1,000 people from the same village, they are
responsible for at least 70 health-care tasks, including providing ante-
and postnatal care and ensuring that infants and children are vaccinated
on time. In the past seven years, they have gone beyond their duty to
help pregnant women recover from the trauma caused by floods and other
climate disasters.
</p>
<p>
After Jamadar lost her baby, for instance, Kamble began visiting her
every three to four days, asking about her problems and listening
patiently to the answers, sometimes for several hours. Often, Jamadar
spoke of her fear of floods. Kamble started talking to more women and
found that they all needed someone to share their frustration and fears
with. “In several villages, even today, women aren’t allowed to talk
about their stress,” Kamble told me.
</p>
<p>
She started organizing informal discussions in the community where women
including Jamadar could be free to share their trauma — and where Kamble
could monitor their stress levels and nutrition. “I knew I wasn’t alone
in this, and listening to others gave me confidence that we could
recover together,” Jamadar told me.
</p>
<p>
In April 2024, Jamadar gave birth to a child, Aiza, without
complications. “From the start, we did everything right and made sure
Jamadar wasn’t stressed,” Kamble told me proudly.
</p>
<p>
In addition to listening, Kamble also started making a list of where
pregnant women could be evacuated safely in case of another flood. She
would then check if these places had essential facilities like access to
good-quality drinking water and sanitation. ASHAs also started
pre-arranging private vehicle transport for pregnant women in case of
emergency.
</p>
<p>
Through lengthy and careful community engagement, the ASHAs have started
to compile lists of women they expect to become pregnant well before
they actually are. “Three months before someone decides to conceive, we
start providing them with iron and folic acid tablets,” Magdum told me.
This has helped her reduce the anemia rate in her village by 50%.
“Earlier, people didn’t take it seriously, but now everyone inquires
beforehand about the tablets,” she said.
</p>
<p>
None of this has been easy, especially because many ASHAs themselves are
victims of recurring floods and have faced tremendous personal losses.
The state doesn’t consider them full-time workers, and pays them only an
honorarium based on the number of tasks completed. In India’s wealthiest
state, Maharashtra, the average income is just 4,000 to 7,000 Indian
Rupees, or $48 to $83, per month, and often the payments are delayed. As
a result, many ASHAs are forced to double up as farmworkers to make ends
meet.
</p>
<p>
Despite the challenges, ASHAs keep coming up with solutions. “If we stop
working in<strong> </strong>such stressful times, how will the
health-care system survive?” asked Kamble, who handles around 20
pregnancy cases every year and has counseled over 100 pregnant women
since 2017. Since ASHAs are unionized, they often meet to discuss best
practices and share their experiences. Today, thousands of ASHAs across
India are helping women recover emotionally from the trauma caused by
climate change.
</p>
<p>
“ASHA means hope in several Indian languages,” Kamble said, “and I am
proud to bring a smile and hope to several women.”

<h2 id="evolution-of-the-elf-object-file-format">Evolution of the ELF
object file format</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The ELF object file format is adopted by many UNIX-like operating
systems. While I’ve previously delved into the control structures of ELF
and its predecessors, tracing the historical evolution of ELF and its
relationship with the System V ABI can be interesting in itself. ↫
MaskRay The article wasn’t lying. I had no reason to know this – and I’m
pretty sure most of you didn’t either – but it turns out the standards
that define ELF got caught up in the legal murkiness and nastiness of
UNIX. After the dissolution of the committee governing ELF in 1995,
stewardship went from one familiar name to the next, first Novell, then
The Santa Cruz Operation, then Caldera which renamed itself to The SCO
Group, and eventually ending up at UnXis (now Xinuos) in 2011. In 2015,
the last maintainer of ELF left Xinuos, and since then, it’s been
effectively unmaintained. Which is kind of wild, considering ELF is a
crucial building block of virtually all UNIX and UNIX-like operating
systems today. The article mentions there’s a neutral Google Group that
discusses, among other things, ELF, but that, too, has seen dwindling
activity. Still, that group has reached consensus on some changes;
changes that are now not reflected in any of the official texts. It’s a
bit of a mess. If you ever wanted to know the status of ELF as a
standard, this article’s for you.</p>

replacing particularly old and polluting diesel buses in urban areas
could amount to more than $200,000 per bus. But electric buses will
still cost schools an estimated $156,000 more over their lifetimes
compared to new diesel buses, according to the study. “In a dense urban

the savings incurred from electrifying these buses outweigh the costs of
replacement,” said Kari Nadeau, a professor of climate and population

<h2 id="refurb-weekend-canon-cat">Refurb weekend: Canon Cat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-28, from: Old Vintage Computer Research</p>
<p>It’s the Memorial Day holiday weekend and it’s time for a little
deferred maintenance, especially on those machines I intend to work on
more in the near future. So we’ll start with one that’s widely
considered to be a remarkable cul-de-sac in computing history: the Canon
Cat.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">

</div>
Many people take a casual glance at this machine and say, “Isn’t that an
overgrown word processor?” And one could certainly think so, in part
because of its keyboard-centric operation, but mostly from the utterly
uncomprehending way Canon advertised it in 1987. Canon dubbed the Cat a
“<em>work</em> processor” because of its built-in telecommunications,
modem and word processor even though Jef Raskin, its designer, had
intended it as a “people’s computer” that could be inexpensive,
accessible and fully functional — all things he had hoped to accomplish
at Apple after first launching the Macintosh project, prior to departing
in 1982.
<p>
<p>Canon, however, never fully grasped the concept either. Apart from
the tone-deaf marketing, Canon sold the device through their typewriter
division and required the display to only show what a daisywheel printer
could generate, limiting its potential as a general purpose workstation.
There was also an infamous story where Canon engineers added a hard
power switch not present in the original prototype, believing its
absence to be an oversight — over Raskin’s objections, who intended the
machine as an always-on, instantly useable
system.<!-- The Humane Interface p.50--> The Cat nevertheless launched
at an MSRP of $1495 ($4125 in 2024 dollars) in July that year to many
plaudits and design awards, but alleged corporate shenanigans and
uncertainty within Canon doomed it internally, causing them to dropkick
the product after just six months and 20,000 sales. In the wake of the
1987 Black Monday stock market crash Raskin’s investors subsequently
pulled the plug and the company closed in 1991.<!-- SOS 1175311--></p>

But what was actually under the hood was a unique all-in-one 68000
machine with a bitmapped display and a full Forth environment hidden in
its ROM-based, fast-start operating system. There’s no hard disk, just a
single 3.5” floppy drive to save your documents and the current Forth
dictionary. Although the default mode is the built-in word processor,
its tForth (“token-threaded Forth”) dialect was easily unlockable and
Information Appliance, Inc., Raskin’s company that produced the Cat and
licensed it to Canon, published substantial documentation on how to
enable and program in it.
<p>
We’ll have more to say about that <a href="/search/label/canon">in a
future entry</a> when we get into the guts of the OS. Today, we have two
tasks: replace its settings battery and shore up the nearly unobtainium
custom Canon floppy drive, its most common point of failure. It’s time
for a Refurb Weekend.
<p>
<a name='more'></a> Before we begin the job, let’s have a little tour.
The Cat’s notability is such that there are
<a href="http://www.canoncat.net/cat/Cat%20Work%20Processor.pdf">many
analyses of it</a> (PDF), including Raskin’s own musings in <i>The
Humane Machine</i>, and I probably couldn’t do justice to it in this
particular article. But a brief historical digression is always in order
around these parts.
<p>
<p>After Raskin left Apple in 1982, he took his ideas and founded
Information Appliance, Inc. in Palo Alto later that
year.<!-- SOS 1175311--> “By choosing to focus on computers rather than
the tasks we wanted done, we inherited much of the baggage that had
accumulated around earlier generations of computers,” Raskin wrote in
1986. “It is more a matter of style and operating systems that need
elaborate user interfaces to support huge application programs.” He
envisioned an environment that provided word processing, information
retrieval (i.e., search), programming and telecommunications in a single
integrated package — it would do the basic tasks you need and be
expandable to the later ones you’d want. This concept was first
formalized as the original Swyft project.

started</a> as a 6502-based platform which quickly evolved into
<a href="https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/prototype-to-the-canon-cat-the-swyft.12225/#post-174905">a
system not unlike the released Cat</a> except for using a 68008 CPU
(i.e., a 68000 with an 8-bit data bus and a 1MB addressing range).
However, IAI’s investors were concerned that its development was taking
too long and prevailed upon Raskin’s team to commercially surface the
technology earlier.</p>

Thus was developed the SwyftCard, a port of the Swyft’s software on a
16K EPROM and some glue logic for bankswitching that went in slot 3 of
the Apple IIe. Its sole function was to instantly start the environment
when the machine was powered on (no need for booting off floppy). 40K of
the IIe’s 64K was available as the user’s workspace, which was loaded at
the start of a session and written out at the end of it. The SwyftCard
did not interfere with booting most regular Apple II software and could
bank itself out without needing to physically remove the card.
<p>
Like the Swyft, the SwyftCard came up in a word processor mode as its
default interface in which you could immediately type and print text.
The workspace stored everything centrally: data from any source, even
serial telecommunications such as a modem call, went right into the
document too (you could even dial up a Swyft system if it had an
auto-answer modem and send it text remotely). The workspace was one big
document, subdivided into smaller ones which could be printed, edited or
erased individually — which is to say, there was no file system at all.
To switch workspaces, you just switched floppies, and the software kept
track of whether the current document workspace matched the disk in the
drive. The Swyft’s most notable innovation was the concept of “leaping,”
where you held a “leap” key down and typed in the phrase you were
looking for, and special attention was paid to making this unique means
of workspace navigation as fast as possible. For the SwyftCard, this was
implemented with the two Apple keys.
<p>
Porting from the Swyft was relatively straightforward since much of the
high-level operating system was written in Forth, a language
well-established on the 6502 as well, though the 6502’s smaller 64K
addressing space mandated using the banking logic on the card for memory
management. However, a notable difference from Swyft was that SwyftCard
users programmed it in good old Applesoft BASIC. You could type a BASIC
program directly into the editor, highlight it, and then have it execute
— and the output went into your document. This was an easy way to do
calculations, for example, but most any appropriate BASIC operation
would work such as string variables for templates and frequently used
text. IAI offered the entire package in 1985 for $89.95 (in 2024 about
$260) with the SwyftCard, a tutorial disk and a ProDOS interchange
utility, and won strong reviews from Apple II magazines at the time.
David Thornburg wrote in <i>A+</i> that “[i]t not only outperforms any
Apple II word-processing system, but it also lets the Apple //e
outperform the Macintosh.”
<p>
<p>While the Cat was reportedly developed on time and on budget, IAI’s
investors remained unhappy with its gestational pace, and refused to
invest sufficient capital to allow IAI to sell it under its own name.
This forced IAI management to find a willing licensee for the product,
and they found it in Japanese electronics manufacturer Canon, who was
looking for another way to crack the microcomputer market after years of
repeated failures. Raskin’s original target price point was $795, but
this was again vetoed and the higher price instituted for better
margins. Internally the machine is called the Canon V777.</p>

<p>Here’s the default editor. The Cat inherits the same interface as the
Swyft (and, by descent, the SwyftCard). What’s most noticeable is what’s
not visible: other than a small section at the bottom showing document
settings, margins and a free memory gauge, there are no windows or menus
of any kind. There’s a cursor, but no pointer.</p>

<p>In fact, there aren’t even conventional cursor keys. The Cat has the
same “leap” keys as the Swyft and SwyftCard, in a bright but tasteful
pink, and they work the same way to jump to portions of the document or
into other documents. You can also use them to scroll with the SHIFT
key, or move by single letters, sentences or paragraphs. The LEAP keys
are also how you highlight text blocks to manipulate by LEAPing to the
beginning, LEAPing to the end, and then pressing them together.</p>

<p>Much, but not all, of the rest of the interface is exposed on blue
labels on the front of the keys. These are accessed by USE FRONT, which
is basically the Cat’s Command key, and even the LEAP keys have special
functions with USE FRONT. For some operations you’ll keep USE FRONT and
other keys down and add others into chords. Raskin was emphatic that the
Swyft and Cat should not have modes — when you release the keys, the
operation is over, whatever that ends up meaning.</p>

<p>For everything else, there’s built-in online help with the EXPLAIN
key combination (USE FRONT+N). Besides on-demand assistance, the EXPLAIN
facility also serves as the “error centre.” If the Cat hits an error,
you don’t get a modal dialogue; instead, it just politely beeps. You can
then ask it to explain itself and it will give its objections in
prose.</p>

As the Swyft and Cat were independent systems (unlike the SwyftCard),
they’re Forth through and through, and via a hidden setting you can
program in it (or in 68000 assembly). Like most Forth environments of
the day, Forth didn’t run under an operating system; Forth <em>was</em>
the operating system. The particular dialect on the Cat is tForth, for
“token-threaded” Forth, which instead of storing direct execution
addresses for each instruction in a Forth word executes using smaller
tokens which are looked up instead. This exchanges the cost of an
indirect lookup in a table for substantially greater code density.
<p>
<p>Canon did not mention its programming capability in their user
documentation, but IAI discussed it at length in their own documents, as
the “secret” programmer’s setting was never intended to be truly secret.
When Forth is enabled, you can either type in Forth words at a
traditional <tt>ok</tt> prompt, or you can type Forth code into your
document, highlight it and execute it (USE FRONT+ANSWER). When running
code this way, any output appears in your document.</p>

The Cat also featured a reasonable amount of I/O. There’s a DB-25 RS-232
port, RJ-11 jacks for modem and phone handset (optional), a
Centronics-style printer port and a small recessed push button switch
which starts diagnostics if depressed (with a pin or some such) at power
on.

serial, printer and phone ports, there is a small switch SW1 not
accessible from the rear panel with “T”erminal and “H”ost settings for
the serial port; it should normally be set to “H”ost.
<p>
The Cat uses a full 68000 instead of the 68008 of the Swyft (at IC1),
which also makes it faster. The 256K system ROM is provided as four 64K
EPROMs with coloured labels interleaved to yield the standard 68K
big-endian 32-bit long. The 128K ROM at IC6 south of (under) the
coloured EPROMs is the spellcheck dictionary, referred to as the SV-ROM.
This is the USA/Japan chip; other locales may be at any position of IC6,
IC7 or IC8.
<p>
In the northeast (top right) corner is the RAM, each one a Fujitsu
MB81464 32K (256Kbit) 150ns DRAM chip, used both as the system memory
and partially as the frame buffer. This unit has the default 256K of RAM
(eight), with sockets to add another 128K to equal 384K. An upgrade to
do some other time. It should be possible to populate the other
unsocketed row as well but I’d prefer not to solder on a rare system if
I can avoid it.
<p>
The show is primarily run by three custom Canon gate arrays at IC30
(NH4-5001, GA#1), IC13 (NH4-5002, GA#2) and IC31 (NH4-5003, GA#3). GA#1
controls the main system oscillator X1, a “20MHz” (actually 19.968MHz)
crystal used directly for RAS, CAS and the video data shift clock, which
it divides by four for the CPU’s “5MHz” (actually 4.992MHz) clock, and
also generates the horizontal and vertical video sync for the CRT. It
handles fetching video data from shared RAM which is fed into GA#2. GA#2
actually emits the pixels to the monitor, as well as handling the
watchdog timer (if the CPU doesn’t regularly reset this timer, GA#2 will
pass it an NMI, and then reset it if necessary), sending the regular
keystrobe interrupt (via the 68681 DUART at IC34), and controlling the
modem off-hook status. GA#3 handles the printer, keyboard and floppy
drive.
<p>
The Motorola MC68681P DUART is a two-port UART. One port handles serial
communications from the internal modem and the other port handles either
the external RS-232 or the printer port, as configured. It also manages
the beeper at “BZ” and is a source of two IRQs, the keystrobe interrupt
from GA#2 (keyscan is done every 6.5ms), and when a telephone ring is
detected by the modem. It takes a 3.6864MHz clock provided by GA#1;
earlier board revisions had a discrete crystal for this located where
the large trace is northeast of the DUART.
<p>
The modem hardware is logically in the southwest (bottom left) corner,
closest to the phone jacks. The major chips here are the AMI S35213 at
IC37, a Bell 212A 300/1200bps modem-on-a-chip, an AMI S2579 DTMF touch
tone generator at IC40 and the AMI S35212A Bell 212/V.22 modem filter at
IC38. The S35213 is clocked by the 2.4576MHz crystal at X3 and the S2579
is clocked by the 3.579545MHz crystal at X4. The modem feeds into the
DUART.
<p>
<p>The “ROM” at IC11 is actually an 8K 150ns static RAM, an NEC D4364C
with specific support for battery backup. The service manual calls this
the SV-RAM. This is what the CR2032 battery powers at the southeast
(lower right) corner. It’s dead, of course, so with a little gentle
levering we pop it out with the nylon spudger and replace it.</p>

<p>To get into the top case, we’ll now need to free the CPU board from
the other two connectors, so once we’ve replaced the battery and put
back on the Faraday cage, we’ll disconnect the mainboard completely.
These connectors, fortunately, are keyed.</p>

<p>The floppy drive bracket is secured to the side of the CRT cage with
four mounting screws. If you have a slim enough 90-degree screwdriver,
you <em>might</em> be able to just get the floppy drive unscrewed

<p>The bracket is secured in three locations like a triangle. This is
the triangle’s “apex.” In this view, it is the bottommost screw sitting

just as hard to tighten. You may have to work on it for awhile to get it
and the tab it’s bolting to the CRT cage free.</p>

There it is, the notorious Canon MD-3301. Just leave the cable
connected. This is a custom drive by Canon known only to have been used
in the Cat. It has a 20-pin interface instead of the regular 34-pin PC
floppy interface, though with some logic and cabling it is possible to
use a regular PC 3.5” floppy drive in it.
<p>
<p>This unit fortunately still works, so what we’re going to do next is
a little preventive maintenance (other than the usual inspection,
cleaning, etc.).</p>

<p>The problem that occurs with this drive has to do with the head’s
guide rail. (This section is with thanks to Dwight Elvey, the unofficial
“godfather” of the Canon Cat.) In this view the head is the white square
with the black line through the middle, and the rail it rides on is the
metal post to the east (right) of it. This is a 2x enlargement, so the
head is actually a fairly small part.</p>

The guide rail extends towards the back of the unit where the cable is.
If you draw an imaginary line between the silkscreened backwards “20”
and “21” digits on the PCB, you can see the other end of that same rod.
This photo is 1x, so you’re looking for a relatively thin cylinder.
<p>
Along that rod are two white nylon pieces secured by screws. These nylon
tabs, in particular the rearmost, serve to clamp down the rod so it
can’t pop up. These tabs here are luckily in excellent condition, but
that isn’t the case for many Cat drives where the nylon has degenerated
with age. When both tabs either crack or loosen, the rod is no longer
held in. Ejecting a disk, even gently, could now cause the head to tilt
into the open metal window of the floppy disk and get stuck. Should that
happen and you innocently attempt to remove the floppy, you might
accidentally end up pulling the head off. Doing so is catastrophic and
would be extremely difficult to repair.
<p>
There are several strategies for dealing with this problem. While the
middle tab is subject to the same age-related breakdown as the rearmost
tab, the drive can survive the middle tab failing as long as the
rearmost one is still intact. Unfortunately, the rearmost tab is
correspondingly the one under the most mechanical stress. Here, both
tabs are in very good shape, so we’re going to concentrate on the rear
tab, though what you do to the rear tab could also be done to the middle
one.
<p>
<p>If the nylon tabs are still holding, then you could reinforce them
with something like a very small layer of JBWeld (other kinds of epoxy
may not be strong enough), though this is fiddly and you’d better not
get the goop anywhere else in the drive. It should also be possible to
fashion a similar plastic piece of similar thickness. I don’t know if a
3D printed one would have enough strength, so you might consider
starting with a solid piece of good quality high-strength polymer and
shaving and drilling it to fit.</p>

<p>Or you can do what Canon probably should have done in the first place
and back it up with metal. I went to Home Despot and bought a roll of
28-gauge galvanized steel pipe hanger tape which at 0.015” thick
(0.38mm) is still thin enough to fit on top of the piece. (It also gave
me an excuse to use those metal snips I bought that were just sitting

<p>The nice thing about this particular type of pipe hanger strap (Oatey
#33526) is that it has a pre-drilled hole of just about the right size.
We’ll get out the snips and trim it down.</p>

<p>Secured in position. The screw is not very long, so you can’t use a
very thick piece of metal here, but there was still enough room to get
it attached firmly over the original nylon. I inserted a disk and
checked that it fed in and the head stayed clear when it ejected.</p>

<p>IAI developed one additional Swyft-family unit, the prototype Swyft
Model III. This was supposed to be a portable unit with an external
floppy drive, a 640x200 supertwist LCD, 512K of RAM and a 2400bps
internal modem. Since it had no hard disk or internal floppy drive,
battery life was reputed to be six hours with 8 AA NiCads (longer with
alkalines), though the processor wasn’t specified. It was never released
before IAI closed its doors. While Raskin retained the patents and even
tried resurrecting the concept in software with

again. Raskin
