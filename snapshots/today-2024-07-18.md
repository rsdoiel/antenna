## News CEOs and the Question of News Experience

date: 2024-07-18, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">
<p>[<a href="https://dicktofel.substack.com/p/news-ceos-and-the-question-of-news?publication_id=261598&amp;post_id=146601668&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5xqp&amp;triedRedirect=true">Richard J. Tofel</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"I think some of those choosing these new business leaders themselves forgot about the special nature of the news business. It won’t be enough, for instance, at least in most cases, for someone who aspires to run a news organization to recognize the importance of the role of the press in democratic governance—although that ought to be essential."</p><p>"[...] More subtly, a CEO without news experience may not grasp how large of an asset is newsroom morale, or how much sapping it may cost an enterprise. Such issues can become particularly tricky in a unionized environment— especially one in which there are no profits over which to haggle, either because the organization is a nonprofit, or because it is no longer profitable."</p></blockquote><p>Dick Tofel was the founding general manager of <a href="https://propublica.org">ProPublica</a>, and generally knows a thing or two about the news business.</p><p>There's a line to walk here: there's certainly risk, as Tofel describes, of picking a news CEO who is not familiar with the news business. At the same time, as I've previously lamented, <a href="https://werd.io/2024/innovation-in-news-is-an-oxymoron">the industry needs an injection of new, outside ideas</a>. It's certainly true that the CEO must deeply understand how news works, but they also can't be to afraid to change some of those dynamics - as long as they're cognizant of the position and responsibility that journalism holds in a democracy.</p><p>Any CEO needs to be very aware of organizational culture and morale. Many news CEOs are hyper-focused on their journalism (which is good!) at the expense of thinking too deeply about culture (which is bad). Hopefully any good incoming CEO would be an expert at building culture, although most of us know that this often isn't the case.</p><p>It's complicated, in other words. But journalism is at least as important as it's ever been, and getting news leadership right is crucial.</p>

## Caught in the middle of the U.S. and China

date: 2024-07-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>First, semiconductor manufacturer TSMC has seen a surge in sales, yet its stock took a hit yesterday. That followed news the U.S. might further curb exports to China and comments by former President Donald Trump that TSMC&#8217;s home base of Taiwan would need to start paying for its own defense. Then, as the U.S.-China economic relationship becomes more contentious, where does that leave Europe? We dig in. And later: why women’s health is so far behind the curve.</p>

## Unified kernel image

date: 2024-07-18, from: OS News

UKIs can run on UEFI systems and simplify the distribution of small kernel images. For example, they simplify network booting with iPXE. UKIs make rootfs and kernels composable, making it possible to derive a rootfs for multiple kernel versions with one file for each pair. A Unified Kernel Image (UKI) is a combination of a UEFI boot stub program, a Linux kernel image, an initramfs, and further resources in a single UEFI PE file (device tree, cpu µcode, splash screen, secure boot sig/key, &#8230;). This file can either be directly invoked by the UEFI firmware or through a boot loader. ↫ Hugues If you&#8217;re still a bit unfamiliar with unified kernel images, this post contains a ton of detailed practical information. Unified kernel images might become a staple for forward-looking Linux distributions, and I know for a fact that my distribution of choice, Fedora, has been working on it for a while now. The goal is to eventually simplify the boot process as a whole, and make better, more optimal use of the advanced capabilities UEFI gives us over the old, limited, 1980s BIOS model. Like I said a few posts ago, I really don&#8217;t want to be using traditional bootloaders anymore. UEFI is explicitly designed to just boot operating systems on its own, and modern PCs just don&#8217;t need bootloaders anymore. They&#8217;re points of failure users shouldn&#8217;t be dealing with anymore in 2024, and I&#8217;m glad to see the Linux world is seriously moving towards negating the need for their existence.

## The Silicon Valley Would-Be Vice President

date: 2024-07-18, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p><img src="https://werd.io/file/6699193f00f7491edb086c12/thumb.jpg" alt="A screenshot from MSNBC, showing " mass reportation now signs waving at the republican national convention width="1024" height="576"></p><p>JD Vance is an obvious, bald-faced opportunist. It makes sense that Trump would pick him as his Vice Presidential candidate; they probably understand each other quite well.</p><p>It can’t have hurt that a bevy of tech billionaires told Trump to pick him, and it’s not unreasonable to assume they gated funding on that choice. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199700/elon-musk-joe-lonsdale-america-pac-donald-trump">Elon Musk has pledged to give $45 million a month to a PAC newly formed to back Trump</a>; Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, former Yammer founder David Sacks, and VC Chamath Palihapitiya have also raised money for the group. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/07/16/trump-lands-more-big-tech-backers-billionaire-venture-capitalist-andreessen-joins-wave-supporting-former-president/">Eponymous Andreessen-Horowitz founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz pledged donations</a> and Keith Rabois has also reportedly pledged a comparatively paltry $1 million. (The Winkelvoss twins are also donors, but I wouldn’t exactly call them Silicon Valley insiders.)</p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/16/andreessen-horowitz-co-founders-explain-why-theyre-supporting-trump/">Andreessen explained why</a>, saying that the future of America is at stake:</p><blockquote><p>Biden’s proposal to tax unrealized capital gains is what Andreessen called “the final straw” that forced him to switch from supporting the current president to voting for Trump. If the unrealized capital gains tax goes into effect, startups may have to pay taxes on valuation increases. (Private companies’ appreciation is not liquid. However, the U.S. government collects tax in dollars.)</p></blockquote><p>One could argue, of course, that the future of America <em>is</em> at stake. <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/project-2025-women-education-lgbtq-workforce/">As The 19th reported about Project 2025</a>, the Heritage Foundation’s suggested plan for a next Trump administration whose authors include over 140 people who were a part of the last one:</p><blockquote><p>Much of Project 2025 relates to gender, sexuality and race, aiming to end most all of the federal government’s efforts to achieve equity and even collect data that could be used to track outcomes across the public and private sectors.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/12/project-2025-summary-trump/">other sweeping changes it proposes include</a> firing civil servants and replacing them with Trump loyalists, removing the Department of Education, gutting our already-insufficient climate change protections, reinstating the military draft, conducting sweeping immigration raids and mass deportations, and condemning more people to death sentences while making them swift enough to avoid retrial.</p><p>All this despite being on shaky legal ground:</p><blockquote><p>Some of these ideas are impractical or possibly illegal. Analysts are divided about whether Trump can politicize the civil workforce to fire them at will, for example. And the plan calls for using the military to carry out mass deportations on a historic scale, which could be constitutionally iffy.</p></blockquote><p>Trump has lately distanced himself from the plan in public, but privately <a href="https://x.com/VaughnHillyard/status/1811402883604050216">said something quite different at a Heritage Foundation dinner</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“This is a great group and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do, and what your movement will do, when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.”</p></blockquote><p>For his part, Kevin Roberts, the President of the Heritage Foundation, <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/project-2025/heritage-foundation-president-celebrates-supreme-court-immunity-decision-we-are">said out loud on Steve Bannon’s podcast</a>:</p><blockquote><p>We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.</p></blockquote><p>JD Vance is walking this line too. My employer, ProPublica, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/jd-vance-alex-jones-leonard-leo-teneo-maddow-video">recently reported that he, among other things</a>, believes that the Devil is real, and that he had some unpleasant things to say about trans people:</p><blockquote><p>He said that Americans were “terrified to tell the truth” and “point out the obvious,” including that “there are real biological, cultural, religious, spiritual distinctions between men and women.” He added, “I think that’s what the whole transgender thing is about, is like fundamentally denying basic reality.”</p></blockquote><p>So, yes, all things considered, it feels a bit like America is in the balance.</p><p>What’s particularly bald about involvement from the Silicon Valley crowd is that they are, according to them, overlooking all of this and concentrating solely on their business interests. If policies like a tax on unrealized capital gains or tighter anti-trust actions are enacted, those investors may have to re-think some of their investment strategies.</p><p>For what it’s worth, <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2024/04/president-bidens-budget-calls-for-raising-43-trillion-in-revenues-over-ten-years-heres-how">those taxes are only applicable for individuals with a net worth of over $100M</a>, with payments at an automatic minimum tax rate treated as prepayments against future realized gains. The effect could actually be to encourage startups to go public and realize their value sooner, which wouldn’t be a terrible thing for the ecosystem (but might limit the heights private valuations can reach). Given that people with that level of worth don’t usually make taxable <em>income</em>, this new levied tax on investment gains makes sense as a way to encourage the very wealthy to pay the same sorts of tax rates as the rest of us — but, clearly, Musk, Thiel, et al feel differently. (Invasive thought: where’s Sacks and Palihapitiya’s podcast co-host Jason Calacanis on this? Is he a sympathizer or just an enabler?)</p><p>Do tighter regulations and a new minimum tax for the wealthy risk the future of America, though? Maybe they have a different definition of America than I do. If, to them, it’s a place where you can make a bunch of money without oversight or accountability, then I can see how they might be upset. If, on the other hand, America is a place where immigrants are welcome and everyone can succeed, and where everyone has the freedom to be themselves, all built on a bedrock of infrastructure and support, then one might choose to take a different view. The tax proposal at hand is hardly socialism; it’s more like a correction. Even if you accept their premise, single-issue voting when the other issues include mass deportations and gutting public education is myopically self-serving, leave alone the barren inhumanity of leaving vulnerable communities out to dry.</p><p>Responses by prominent Republican supporters to the inclusion of a Sikh prayer in Punjabi in the Republican National Convention — one line reading, “in your grace and through your benevolence, we experience peace and happiness” — <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/rnc-delegates-sound-off-on-whether-america-should-be-a-christian-nation/">lay bare what the unhinged Christian nationalist contingent believes in</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Andrew Torba, CEO of the far-right social media platform Gab, ranted to his 400,000 followers on X, “Last night you saw why Christian Nationalism must be exclusively and explicitly Christian. No tolerance for pagan false gods and the synagogue of Satan.” Republican Oklahoma state Sen. Dusty Deevers seemed to agree. “Christians in the Republican party nodding silently along to a prayer to a demon god is shameful,” he posted.</p></blockquote><p>From my perspective, there are no upsides to a Trump win. Even if you accept the idea that Project 2025 has nothing to do with him (which, as I’ve discussed, is laughable), his own self-published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_47">Agenda 47</a> for his next administration is similarly horrible, and includes provisions like sending the National Guard into cities, destroying climate crisis mitigations, mass deportations, and removing federal funding for any educational institution that dares to teach the history of race in America. It also includes a version of Project 2025’s call to fire civil servants who are seen as disloyal. JD Vance <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/jd-vance-working-women-moms.html">wants to end no-fault divorce</a>(ironically, given his running mate), trapping people in abusive relationships. The effects on the judicial system from his first administration will be felt for generations; a second administration will be similarly seismic. He will gut support for vulnerable communities. I have friends who will directly suffer as a result of his Presidency; he will create an America that I do not want to bring my son up in.</p><p>Silicon Valley is supposed to invent the future. That’s what’s so inspiring about it: for generations, it’s created new ways of sharing and working that have allowed people to communicate and work together wherever they are. These new moves make it clearer than ever that a portion of it has never believed in that manifesto; that it is there solely to establish itself as a new set of power-brokers, trying to remake the world in their own image. The rest of us need to oppose them with our full voices and everything we can muster.</p></div>

## The GOP want to preserve Social Security with no cuts. Can it?

date: 2024-07-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>At the start of this week’s Republican National Convention, Republicans adopted a new platform that promises to preserve Social Security and Medicare with no cuts, while also pledging to cut taxes for working Americans. Can those two objectives be squared? We&#8217;ll also hear more about the economics of J.D. Vance and learn how Gaza&#8217;s farmers are faring amid war. Plus, from today&#8217;s &#8220;Marketplace Tech,&#8221; how can we limit the fallout from misinformation after political violence?</p>

## US says China's halt of arms-control talks undermines strategic stability

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

State Department — The United States called China's decision to suspend nascent arms-control talks with Washington "unfortunate," noting that China has opted not to engage in efforts to manage strategic risks and prevent costly arms races.


“We think this approach undermines strategic stability. It increases the risk of arms race dynamics. We have made efforts to bolster the defense of our allies and partners in the Indo Pacific, and we will continue to make those efforts in the face of Chinese threats to their security,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters during a briefing on Wednesday.


The Chinese foreign ministry announced on Wednesday that Beijing has decided to hold off on discussions with the U.S. regarding a new round of consultations on arms control and non-proliferation. 


This decision is a protest against Washington's arms sales to Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its territory.


“China has chosen to follow Russia's lead in asserting that engagement on arms control can't proceed when there are other challenges in the bilateral relationship,” Miller added.


On November 6, 2023, officials from the U.S. and China convened for a new strategic risk reduction discussion at the State Department. 


Leading the U.S. delegation was Mallory Stewart, assistant secretary for the State Department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability (ADS). The Chinese delegation was headed by Sun Xiaobo, director general for arms control at China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with other civilian officials also in attendance.


The U.S. has proposed three measures to China aimed at reducing strategic risks related to missile launches or potential missile launches. These include establishing a strategic crisis hotline between their respective Strategic Commands, implementing space deconfliction measures, and adopting missile launch notifications, a practice observed by China with Russia.


China's decision to halt the new round of strategic risk reduction talks was described as not a significant loss to the U.S., as Chinese officials did not propose any initiatives during the November discussions, according to a source familiar with the matter.


The source also noted that similar talks between the U.S. and China under previous administrations had yielded no tangible results.


“China stands ready to maintain communication with the U.S. on international arms control issues in line with the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation,” said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Wednesday. 


“But the U.S. must respect China’s core interests and create necessary conditions for dialogue and exchange,” he said.


Some former U.S. intelligence officials doubt the effectiveness of ongoing government-to-government engagements and exchanges. They argue that Beijing's recent suspension of risk reduction talks in response to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan serves as a convenient pretext for China to persist with its internal nuclear arms buildup and external proliferation.


James Fanell, a retired U.S. Navy captain and former director of intelligence and information operations for the U.S. Pacific Fleet, commented that “talks can and will be held when the Chinese Communist Party changes its nefarious actions and destabilizing behavior."


In a report mandated by Congress last October, the Pentagon revealed that China was developing its nuclear arsenal more quickly than the U.S. had previously estimated.


As of May 2023, China had more than 500 operational nuclear warheads, with projections indicating they could exceed 1,000 by 2030.


According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the United States currently has about 3,700 nuclear warheads, fewer than Russia's estimated 4,500.


The U.S. switched its diplomatic recognition from the government in Taipei to the government in Beijing in 1979.


Since then, the U.S. policy has maintained that differences between the two sides should be settled peacefully and in accordance with the will of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. The United States acknowledges but has never endorsed Beijing’s sovereignty claim over Taiwan.


Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.

Steelmaking alone accounts for about 10% of global carbon dioxide emissions, so greener production is essential. The GEM report found that 93% of new planned steel capacity will use low-emission electric arc furnaces instead of the much dirtier blast furnace. It projects that the global steelmaking fleet could be very close to meeting the International Energy Agency’s net zero emissions targets by 2030. “The transition to greener steel is afoot,” the report said, but it acknowledged that the blast furnace isn’t going away just yet and remains a climate risk.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## A musical intermission

<p>I’m going to be out of commission for a while,  as the date for planned surgery has rolled around. Hopefully, I’ll be back in reasonable working order next month.

## Should you give up social media?

date: 2024-07-18, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>In a <a href="https://kevquirk.com/blog/could-you-give-up-social-media">recent post</a>, Kev used the magic words to summon me and make me write something on this site: he talked about social media, mentioned me, and posed a question. Rather than focusing on the could/should/would why don’t we focus on the actual product and figure out what is that we’re getting out of social media? And I’m saying “we” even though I’m not really on any traditional social media platform. But more on that later.</p>
<p>The quality and usefulness of a social platform are a by-product of three factors: my inputs, other people’s inputs, and the platform creator’s intentions. The first two are quite obvious since social media is the product of what people decide to put into it. The third is what really shapes a platform. Not all platforms are created equal and as a result of that the mixture of inputs and outputs can differ widely from one digital place to another. Fame and money are terrible incentives when it comes to digital spaces because people are willing to do pretty much everything to get a following if that can help them earn money. So every time a platform gets big enough you just know things are doomed to turn to shit. That’s an inescapable reality of social platforms. So if you’re looking for a decent social media space you probably want to stay on one that’s designed to either stay small in size or one that’s designed to stay small in scope.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to think that a Mastodon server is a good example of the first type but you’d be wrong. The decentralised social media experiments—Mastodon, Threads, Bluesky—are not designed to stay small. Quite the contrary. They can stay small but you have to fight against the main concept behind those platforms. In the past, I argued that <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/small-communities-are-the-best-communities">small communities are the best type of communities</a> and so one potential solution to this social media conundrum is to find—or create!—a closed-door, small community that wants to stay small on purpose in order to keep it sane.</p>
<p>Another potential solution is to not join a kitchen-sink social platform where (almost) everything goes and instead join one that is specifically designed to cater for a specific audience. <a href="https://literal.club">Literal</a> is a good example. It’s a social platform but the focus is books so everything that’s happening there is related to books and book reading. You won’t find people sharing memes or random links or anything like that but if you care about books you’ll find plenty of those.</p>
<p>Another good example is <a href="https://read.cv/">read.cv</a> and its sibling, <a href="https://posts.cv/">posts.cv</a>. The first one gives out very early Dribbble vibes but with a different overall aesthetic and the second, since it’s tied to the first one, is a Twitter clone where everyone’s a designer posting stuff about design or photography. I have a profile on both so technically I am on social media but my activity on there is non-existent. I update the <a href="https://read.cv/manuelmoreale">read.cv profile</a> periodically since it’s my online CV and I never posted anything on post.cv even though every three or four weeks I scroll through it for 5 minutes to see what people are creating. And it’s an incredibly positive experience. No flame wars, no memes, and nobody is trying to crypto scam anyone. Just a chill place that’s mainly focused on design (and cats).</p>
<p>The main issue with social media is that we want them to be everything. We want them to be a place for casual interactions, for discovery, for news, for serious discourse. And that’s a mistake. Because the moment you put a stupid amount of people in one room and you let them do whatever they want the only reasonable outcome you can expect is chaos. Sure, you might get some positive results out of it but you’ll also likely get someone shitting in a corner and someone trying to fuck the power outlet. Because that’s the world we live in. Now sprinkle some nonsense AI on top of it all and Bob’s your uncle.</p>
<p>So, to circle back to the original question you asked Kev, I don’t think it’s a matter of wanting to give up social media entirely. You should be asking if you’re willing to give up this specific flavour of social media, you should be asking what parts of this type of social media you’re treasuring and then figure out if there are saner ways to get those same things elsewhere.</p>                <hr>

## JD Vance will introduce himself to the nation at the RNC as Trump's running mate

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

MILWAUKEE — Introducing himself to the nation after being tapped as Donald Trump's running mate, JD Vance is planning to use his Wednesday night address to the Republican National Convention to share the story of his hardscrabble upbringing and make the case that his party best understands the challenges facing struggling Americans.


The 39-year-old Ohio senator is a relative political unknown. In his first primetime speech since becoming the nominee for vice president, Vance is expected to talk about growing up poor in Kentucky and Ohio, his mother addicted to drugs and his father absent, and how he later went on to the highest levels of U.S. politics.


Vance, who rapidly morphed in recent years from a bitter critic of the former president to an aggressive defender, is positioned to become the future leader of the party and the torch-bearer of Trump's "Make America Great Again" political movement, which has reshaped the Republican Party and broken longtime political norms. The first millennial to join the top of a major party ticket, he enters the race as questions about the age of the men at the top — 78-year-old Trump and 81-year-old Biden — have been high on the list of voters' concerns.


Speaking earlier Wednesday, at his first fundraiser as Trump's running mate, Vance said he will use the speech to highlight the contrast between Trump and Biden.


"The guy who actually connects with working people in this country is not Fake Scranton Joe, it's Real President Donald Trump," he said.


Vance was introduced at the fundraiser by Indiana Rep. Jim Banks, who said Trump's decision to choose Vance wasn't about picking a running mate or the next vice president.


"Donald Trump's decision this week in picking JD Vance was about the future," he said. "Donald Trump picked a man in JD Vance that is the future of the country, the future of the Republican Party, the future of the America First movement."


Along with his relative youth, Vance is new to some of the hallmarks of Republican presidential politics: This year's gathering is the first RNC that Vance has attended, according to a Trump campaign official who was not authorized to speak publicly.


Trump, who entered the arena to a version of the song "It's a Man's World" by James Brown and Luciano Pavarotti, will be watching from his family box.


Convention organizers had stressed a theme of unity, even before Trump survived an attempted assassination at a rally in Pennsylvania Saturday. Trump's refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and the subsequent attack on the U.S. Capitol, officials said, would be absent from the stage.


But that changed with former White House official Peter Navarro, who was greeted with enthusiastic cheers and a standing ovation hours after he was released from a Miami prison where he served four months for defying a subpoena from the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of the former president's supporter.


"If they can come for me, if they can come for Donald Trump, be careful. They will come for you," he said in a fiery speech. He compared his legal troubles to those faced by Trump, who earlier this year was convicted on 34 felony charges in his criminal hush money trial. Trump is also facing two indictments for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.


"They did not break me," Navarro said, "and they will never break Donald Trump."


Also spotted on the floor of the convention: Paul Manafort, Trump's 2016 campaign chair, who was convicted as part of the investigation into Russia's meddling in that election.


Vance is an Ivy League graduate and former businessman, but gained prominence following the publication of his bestselling 2016 memoir "Hillbilly Elegy," which tells the story of his blue-collar roots. The book became a must-read for those seeking to understand the cultural forces that propelled Trump to the White House that year.


Still, most Americans — and Republicans — don't know much about Vance. According to a new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, which was conducted before Trump selected the freshman senator as his choice, 6 in 10 Americans don't know enough about him to have formed an opinion.


About 2 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of him, and 22% view him negatively. Among Republicans, 61% don't know enough to have an opinion of Vance. About one-quarter have a positive view of him, and roughly 1 in 10 have a negative one.


Vance will be introduced Wednesday night by his wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who is a close friend of Vance, will also speak.


Beyond Vance's prime-time speech, the Republican Party focused Wednesday on a theme of American global strength. Speakers were to include family members of service members killed during the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and someone taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack in Israel, according to a person familiar with the program.


Republicans contend that the country has become a "global laughingstock" under Biden's watch. The party that was once home to defense hawks and neoconservatives has fully embraced Trump's "America First" foreign policy that redefined relationships with allies and adversaries.


Democrats have sharply criticized Trump — and Vance — for their positions, including their questioning of U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia's invasion.


In a video released Wednesday by Biden's reelection campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris dismissed Vance as someone Trump "knew would be a rubber stamp for his extreme agenda."


"Make no mistake: JD Vance will be loyal only to Trump, not to our country," Harris says in a video.

## US arrests Syrian who oversaw prison where alleged abuse took place

date: 2024-07-18, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES  — A former Syrian military official who oversaw a prison where human rights officials say torture and abuse routinely took place has been arrested, authorities said Wednesday.


U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents took Samir Ousman al-Sheikh into custody last week at Los Angeles International Airport, said agency spokesperson Greg Hoegner.


The 72-year-old has been charged with immigration fraud, specifically that he denied on his U.S. visa and citizenship applications that he had ever persecuted anyone in Syria, according to a criminal complaint filed on July 9 and reviewed by The Associated Press. Investigators are considering additional charges against al-Sheikh, the complaint shows.


He was in charge of Syria's infamous Adra Prison from 2005 to 2008 under President Bashar Assad. Human rights groups and United Nations officials have accused the Syrian government of widespread abuses in its detention facilities, including torture and arbitrary detention of thousands of people, in many cases without informing their families about their fate. Many remain missing and are presumed to have died or been executed.


"This is the highest-level Assad regime official arrested anywhere in the world. ... This is a really big deal," said Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a U.S.-based opposition organization.


Moustafa said Wednesday that one of his staff members, a former Syrian detainee, was first tipped off in 2022 by a refugee that there was "potentially a war criminal" in the United States. His organization alerted several federal agencies and began working with them to build a case against al-Sheikh.


Al-Sheikh's attorney, Peter Hardin, called it a "simple misunderstanding of immigration forms" that has been politicized and said al-Sheikh "finds himself being made a pawn caught up in a larger international struggle."


"He vigorously denies these abhorrent accusations," Hardin said.


Investigators interviewed five former inmates at the Syrian prison, who described being hanged by their arms from the ceiling, severely beaten with electrical cables, and witnessing other prisoners being branded by hot rods, according to court documents. One inmate described how guards broke his back.


According to the complaint, al-Sheikh, a resident of Los Angeles since 2020, stated in his citizenship application that he had "never persecuted (either directly or indirectly) any person because of race, religion, national origin, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion" and "never been involved in killing or trying to kill someone." This was false, as al-Sheikh persecuted political dissidents and ordered the execution of prisoners while he was head of Adra, the complaint states.


He began his career working police command posts before transferring to Syria's domestic intelligence agency, which focused on countering political dissent, the complaint says. He later became head of Adra Prison and brigadier general in 2005. He also served for one year as the governor of Deir Ez-Zour, a region northeast of the Syrian capital of Damascus, where there were violent crackdowns against protesters.


He had purchased a one-way plane ticket to depart LAX on July 10, en route to Beirut, Lebanon, which shares a border with Syria, according to the complaint. After his arrest, al-Sheikh made his first appearance in Los Angeles federal court last Friday. He has family in the United States, including a daughter living in the Los Angeles area, according to the Syrian Emergency Task Force.


Syria's civil war, which has left nearly half a million people dead and displaced half the country's prewar population of 23 million, began as peaceful protests against Assad's government in March 2011.


Other players in the war, now in its 14th year, have also been accused of abuse of detainees, including insurgent groups and the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which guard suspected and convicted Islamic State members imprisoned in northeastern Syria.


In May, a French court sentenced three high-ranking Syrian officials in absentia to life in prison for complicity in war crimes in a landmark case against Assad's regime and the first such case in Europe.


The court proceedings came as Assad had begun to shed his longtime status as a pariah because of the violence unleashed on his opponents. Human rights groups involved in the case hoped it would refocus attention on alleged atrocities.

## Former diplomats, Google CEO discuss possible impact of Trump, Biden victories

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

washington — American businessman and former diplomat Stephen Biegun says that while China is carefully and quietly watching the U.S. presidential election to avoid the appearance of taking sides, most of the Chinese counterparts that he speaks with say they want former President Donald Trump to be re-elected.  


“There is a certain fascination about him in China and a sense that unpredictability can also deliver outcomes that the Chinese want,” Biegun said in remarks at an Aspen Security Forum discussion Tuesday. “President Trump was not afraid to engage with the Chinese and he did so.”  


Biegun served as the U.S. deputy secretary of state and special representative for North Korea during the Trump administration. He is currently senior vice president of global public policy at Boeing Company.  


He was asked about what a second Trump presidency versus a second term for Joe Biden would look like on China policy. 


Both President Joe Biden and Trump have been tough on China. Trump has proposed that if elected, he would impose a general tariff of 10% on all foreign goods and increasing tariffs on goods from China to 60%.  


Biegun said that a bigger concern of a second Trump presidency in his view would be managing relations beyond China’s borders.  


Across-the-board tariffs are going to make it very difficult for “us to turn around and enlist those countries in a set of sensible policies on a coordinated basis that addresses our national concerns,” he said. 


Asked about the current U.S.-China relationship, Anja Manuel, former diplomat and executive director of the Aspen Strategy Group and the Aspen Security Forum,  said that regardless of who is elected, “no one is under any illusions that you’re going to have a positive upward swing” in U.S.-China relations. 


Manuel, who has worked for Democratic and Republican administrations, said Biden's summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Woodside, California, late last year set a baseline for U.S.-China relations. 


“If there is a second Biden administration, I think you’ll have a lot of continuity,” Manuel said. “They’ve talked about managed competition and they’re handling it the way they are handling it. I think you’re going to see steady as she goes.” 


If Trump is re-elected, she said, U.S.-China relations will be a wild ride, noting that right now there seem to be widely different views from former members of the Trump administration and the former president. 


She said that on the one hand, people who once worked for Trump, such as his deputy national security adviser, Matt Pottinger, and former House Select Committee on China Chairman Mike Gallagher, have written that the United States must defeat China, not just manage competition with it. They made the argument in an article titled "No Substitute for Victory" in Foreign Affairs magazine. 


"And then you have Trump saying things like 60% tariffs. That's probably not good for his base,” she said. 


Referring to an interview with the former president released Tuesday by Bloomberg Businessweek, she added that Trump’s comments on Taiwan also raise questions. 


“You have Trump, on the other hand, saying, well, Taiwan, they stole business and the semiconductor business from America, why should we protect them?” Manuel said. 


“If I were the Chinese, that would leave me to believe that he wouldn't be as strong on the protection of Taiwan or, because he's so unpredictable, that he might do something even more rash, so I don't know if that's a positive or negative. But boy, it's going to be a wild ride." 


In his response, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt focused on Trump's campaign promise to impose a 60% tariff on products from China and a general tariff on all products from all other countries. 


"This would ultimately result in higher costs for those of you who shop at Walmart and those of you who shop at everywhere else," Schmidt said.

## Russia, China taking space into dangerous territory, US says

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Russia and China are edging ever closer to unleashing space-based weapons, a decision that could have far-reaching implications for America’s ability to defend itself, U.S. military and intelligence agencies warn.


Adding to the concern, they say, is what appears to be a growing willingness by both countries to set aside long-running suspicions and animosity in order to gain an edge over the United States.


“I would highlight ... the increasing amount in intent to use counterspace capabilities,” said Lieutenant General Jeff Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.


“Both Russia and China view the use of space early on, even ahead of conflict, as important capabilities to deter or to compel behaviors,” Kruse told the annual Aspen Security Forum on Wednesday. “We just need to be ready.”


Concerns about the safety of space surged earlier this year when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner called for the declassification of “all information” related to what was described as a new Russian anti-satellite capability involving nuclear weapons.




More recently, Turner has warned that the U.S. is “sleepwalking” into a disaster, saying that Russia is on the verge of being able to detonate a nuclear weapon in space, which would impose high costs on the U.S. military and economy.




The White House has responded repeatedly that U.S. officials have been aware of the Russian plans, and that Moscow has not yet deployed a space-based nuclear capability.


It is a stance that Kruse reaffirmed Wednesday, with added caution.


“We have been tracking for almost a decade Russia's intent to design the ability to put a nuclear weapon in space,” he said. “They have progressed down to a point where we think they're getting close.”


The Russians “don't intend to slow down, and until there's repercussions, will not slow down,” he said.




Russian and Chinese officials have yet to respond to VOA’s requests for reaction to the latest U.S. accusations, but both countries have repeatedly denied U.S. criticisms of their space policies.


In May, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov dismissed U.S. concerns about Moscow trying to put nuclear weapons in space as “fake news.”


But the Chinese Embassy in Washington, while admitting there are some “difficulties” when it comes to China-U.S. relations in space, rejected any suggestion Beijing is acting belligerently in space.


“China always advocates the peaceful use of outer space, opposes weaponizing space or an arms race in space and works actively toward the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind in space,” spokesperson Liu Pengyu told VOA in an email.


“The U.S. has been weaving a narrative about the so-called threat posed by China in outer space in an attempt to justify its own military buildup to seek space hegemony,” Liu said. “It is just another illustration of how the U.S. clings on to the Cold War mentality and deflects responsibility.”


Despite Beijing’s public posture, the Defense Intelligence Agency’s Kruse suggested Wednesday that China’s rapid expansion into the space domain is just as worrisome.


“They're in multiple orbits that they did not used to be before,” he told the audience in Aspen, Colorado, warning that Beijing has already invested heavily in directed energy weapons, electronic warfare capabilities and anti-satellite technology.


“China is the one country that more so even than the United States has a space doctrine, a space strategy, and they train and exercise the use of space and counterspace capabilities in a way that we just don't see elsewhere,” he said.


The general in charge of U.S. Space Command described the Chinese threat in even starker terms.


“China is building a kill web, if you will, in space,” said General Stephen Whiting, speaking alongside Kruse at the Aspen conference. 


“In the last six years, they've tripled the number of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites they have on orbit — hundreds and hundreds of satellites, again, purpose built and designed to find, fix, track target and, yes, potentially engage U.S. and allied forces across the Indo-Pacific,” he said.


Whiting also raised concerns about the lack of clear military communication with China about space.


“We want to have a way to talk to them about space safety as they put more satellites on orbit,” he said, “so that we can operate effectively and don't have any miscommunication or unintended actions that cause a misunderstanding.”

## US to dismantle temporary pier built to deliver aid into Gaza

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — The U.S. military is dismantling the temporary pier it built to deliver aid to Palestinians in Gaza via the sea but will continue to help transfer aid for Gaza from Cyprus to the Israeli port of Ashdod, U.S. officials said Wednesday.


“The maritime surge mission involving the pier is complete, so there's no more need to use the pier,” Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, deputy commander for U.S. Central Command, told reporters on Wednesday. 


At least 5 million pounds of aid remains in Cyprus, according to Cooper, which the U.S. military will help transfer to Ashdod, about 40 kilometers south of Tel Aviv. The U.S. plans to use the same vessels that have transported aid from Cypress to the temporary pier to transport aid from Cypress to Ashdod.


Through coordination with the U.S. World Food Program, that aid will be loaded onto trucks to enter Gaza through a northern entry point, he added.


The temporary pier, known as Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore (JLOTS), delivered 8.7 million kilograms (19.4 million pounds) of aid to Gaza in the 20 or so days it was operational, which Cooper said was a “historically unprecedented operation to deliver aid into an active combat zone without any U.S. boots on the ground.” 


“It's the highest volume of humanitarian assistance that the U.S. military has ever delivered into the Middle East,” Cooper said.


U.S. and partner airdrops have delivered 1.08 million kilograms (2.4 million pounds) of aid into Gaza since the war began, while trucks have delivered 15 million kilograms (33.5 million pounds) of aid through land routes.


The Pentagon had planned to re-anchor the temporary pier to the Gaza shore one last time after detaching it late last month because of rough seas, but weather conditions kept the pier in Ashdod, according to officials.


Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden said he was “disappointed” the temporary pier he ordered be established off the coast of Gaza had not met his expectations.


“I was hopeful that would be more successful,” he said.


Cooper said the aid mission for Gaza would end up costing less than the $230 million initially estimated for the mission. He did not provide a specific number. He added that the Gaza aid mission was more cost-efficient than previous U.S. military aid missions of comparable size. For example, the U.S. aid delivery mission to Haiti following an earthquake in 2010 cost about $460 million to deliver 10 million kilometers (23 million pounds) of aid.


U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, the highest-ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday the pier project had caused “national embarrassment.”


“The only miracle is that this doomed-from-the-start operation did not cost any American lives,” he said. “We cannot buy back the $230 million needlessly spent, and significant questions remain about the Biden administration’s poor planning for this mission.”


Wicker said transporting the pier took “roughly double” the amount of time it was actually in use. 


The pier was moved to the Israeli port on June 28 to protect it from weather damage. At the time, officials said there was a chance it would not be reattached.


The pier allowed for aid to enter Gaza via a sea route from Cyprus, a delivery method that officials deemed a “temporary” fix as land routes to get aid into Gaza stalled with long backups of vehicles at Israeli inspection points.


The arrangement was part of an effort to boost what humanitarian organizations say is a vastly insufficient amount of aid for Palestinian civilians.


“We know that there is an urgent need for humanitarian assistance,” Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday at the Pentagon in response to a question from VOA.


Fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, had prevented the aid from leaving the Gaza beach and making it to civilians in need during some of the pier’s deployment.


The late-June pier detachment was not the first time the temporary pier was taken offline because of rough seas. 


Following its completion in mid-May, the pier operated for just a few days before it was damaged by stormy weather in late May. That damage stopped operations until June 8.

## US prosecutors appeal dismissal of Trump classified documents case

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday formally appealed a federal judge's decision to throw out the criminal case brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith accusing Donald Trump of illegally holding on to classified documents following the end of his presidency.


Smith's office filed a notice indicating it would ask the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to revive the case and reverse Florida-based U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon's ruling on Monday that Smith had been unlawfully appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland.


Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Trump in 2020, ruled that Smith's 2022 appointment violated the U.S. Constitution because Congress did not authorize Garland to name a special counsel with the degree of power and independence wielded by Smith.


The decision was the latest in a series of legal victories for Trump. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that Trump has broad immunity from prosecution for official actions taken as president, a decision that has tied up another criminal case brought by Smith involving Trump's attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss.


Trump is the Republican candidate challenging Democratic President Joe Biden in the November 5 U.S. election in a rematch from four years ago.


A Trump campaign spokesperson reiterated Trump's previous call to dismiss all four criminal cases against him in light of Cannon's decision.


Cannon broke with decades of rulings by other federal courts that have upheld the authority of the attorney general to empower a special counsel to handle politically sensitive investigations.  


The practice has been used for decades by administrations of both political parties. Special counsels have also investigated Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.  


Cannon's ruling dismissed the charges against Trump and co-defendants Walt Nauta, a personal aide to Trump, and Carlos De Oliveira, a property manager at the former president's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida where the documents were found during an FBI search.


Trump was accused of illegally retaining sensitive national security documents, including records related to the U.S. nuclear program and potential military vulnerabilities, at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office in January 2021. Trump and the two co-defendants also were accused of obstructing an investigation into Trump's handling of the material.


Trump and his co-defendants had pleaded not guilty.  


In addition to the two indictments obtained by Smith, Trump faced criminal charges in a pair of other cases.  


He became the first former U.S. president to be convicted of a crime when a jury in New York state court found him guilty in May of felony charges related to hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels to avert a sex scandal before the 2016 election. He faces sentencing in September. Trump also faces state charges in Georgia related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat.


The two remaining criminal cases are not expected to be completed before the election.


Smith, a public corruption and international war crimes prosecutor, was appointed to give investigations involving Trump a degree of independence from the Justice Department under the Biden administration. Trump's lawyers have not challenged Smith's appointment in Smith's election-related case.


Six of the 12 active judges on the 11th Circuit were appointed by Trump. The 11th Circuit dealt Trump a defeat earlier over the classified documents. In 2022, before the charges were filed, a three-judge 11th Circuit panel reversed a ruling by Cannon to appoint a third-party "special master" to vet evidence FBI agents seized during a search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago property in Florida.

## Biden tests positive for COVID, cancels Nevada campaign event

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden told reporters late Wednesday that he was “doing well,” hours after testing positive for COVID-19. The White House made the announcement earlier this evening, shortly after he abruptly canceled a Las Vegas speech where he planned to appeal to Latino voters.


The 81-year-old president tested positive after his first event in Las Vegas on Wednesday and is experiencing “mild symptoms,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in the statement. She added that he is vaccinated and boosted against the virus and will return to his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, where he will self-isolate.


“The White House will provide regular updates on the President’s status as he continues to carry out the full duties of the office while in isolation,” she said.


The news was first announced by the president of UnidosUS, the nation’s largest Latino nonprofit advocacy organization.


“Regrettably I was just on the phone with President Biden,” UnidosUS President Janet Murguía told the crowd gathered in a Las Vegas ballroom to hear the president. “And he shared his deep disappointment at not being able to join us this afternoon. The president has been at many events as we all know, and he just tested positive for COVID. So, of course, we understand that he needs to take the precautions that have been recommended, and he did not obviously want to put anybody at risk.”


A message from Biden’s doctor followed Jean-Pierre’s statement, adding that Biden’s respiratory rate, temperature and blood oxygen levels are all normal, and that he has received a dose of treatment. The doctor, whose name was not given in the statement, said Biden had shown symptoms including a runny nose, a cough and general malaise.


“His symptoms remain mild, his respiratory rate is normal at 16, his temperature is normal at 97.8 and his pulse oximetry is normal at 97%,” the note said. “The president has received his first dose of Paxlovid. He will be self-isolating at his home in Rehoboth.”


The diagnosis came the same day as the latest call from a member of Biden’s Democratic Party for the president to drop his reelection bid.


Congressman Adam Schiff warned in a statement that a win by Biden’s opponent, former President Donald Trump, “will undermine the very foundation of our democracy,” and that Schiff has “serious concerns” about whether Biden can win in November.


“While the choice to withdraw from the campaign is President Biden’s alone, I believe it is time for him to pass the torch,” Schiff said. “And in doing so, secure his legacy of leadership by allowing us to defeat Donald Trump in the upcoming election.”

date: 2024-07-17, from: Om Malik blog

&#8220;In 2023, intense competition among over 100 LLMs has emerged in China, resulting in a significant waste of resources, particularly computing power. I&#8217;ve noticed that many people still primarily focus on foundational models. But I want to ask: How about real-world applications? Who has benefitted from them?&#8221; Robin Li Yanhong,&#160;the founder and CEO of Baidu &#8230;

## Florida’s Climate Tech Hub Has a Florida Problem

There are the <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hydrogen-hubs-biden-pennsylvania-california-texas" target="_self"><u>hydrogen hubs</u></a>, the <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-dioxide-removal-industry-biden" target="_self"><u>direct air capture hubs</u></a>, and now there are the <a href="https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/regional-technology-and-innovation-hubs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tech hubs.</u></a> Established as a part of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, the $10 billion program has so far seeded 12 such hubs across the country. Four of these are focused on clean energy and sustainability, and one is located in the great state of Florida, which <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/florida-desantis-climate-change-law" target="_self"><u>recently passed legislation</u></a> essentially deleting the words “climate change” from state law. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.eda.gov/funding/programs/regional-technology-and-innovation-hubs/2023/South-Florida-ClimateReady-Tech-Hub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>South Florida ClimateReady Tech Hub</u></a> did not, in the end, eliminate climate from its name. But while Governor Ron DeSantis might not approve, the federal government didn’t seem to mind, as the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration awarded the hub $19.5 million to “advance its global leadership in sustainable and resilient infrastructure.” </p><p>“Regardless of how you feel about the word climate or the words climate change, what I have found in this process is what deeply resonates with folks is that their relationship with water is changing,” Francesca Covey, chief of economic innovation and development for Miami-Dade County, told me. </p><p>Sea levels around Florida have <a href="https://sealevelrise.org/states/florida/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>risen about 8 inches since 1950</u></a>, and the rate of rise is only accelerating, putting the state’s extensive, low-lying coastlines at high risk for flooding and, eventually, total submersion. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/3/2019/11/08_SROCC_Ch04_FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates</u></a> that by 2100, average sea levels will have risen between 1.4 and 2.8 feet, with more drastic scenarios possible if little is done to curb emissions. </p><p>Covey, who grew up in Miami, said everyone agrees there are simply more puddles and flooded roads to navigate than when she was a kid. “So there is an understanding that regardless of how you think it happened, or why you think it happened, that our everyday life is harder because the environment around us is changing.” </p><p>This narrative, she believes, can help form a basis of bipartisan support for Florida’s hub, which she told me has three technical focus areas: limiting coastal hazards due to sea level rise and extreme weather events, implementing energy efficient technologies, and building resilient structures using low-carbon concrete and cement. South Florida, Covey said, is the perfect place to undertake these projects, as the state has been investing in climate adaptation and mitigation since 1992, when Hurricane Andrew touched down in Miami-Dade County, causing $25 billion in damages. Since then, she says the state’s universities have been churning out climate tech intellectual property. </p><p>“We’re seeing the IP grow 10% year-over-year over the last few years,” Covey said. Nine colleges and universities are tech hub partners, with the bulk of the funding going to <a href="https://news.fiu.edu/2024/department-of-commerce-funds-south-florida-climateready-tech-hub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Florida International University</u></a>, which will receive $10.3 million to help scale up low-carbon concrete tech, establish an infrastructure innovation center, and improve upon industry building codes and standards. <a href="https://news.mdc.edu/pressrelease/mdcs-miami-tech-works-to-lead-workforce-development-component-of-the-south-florida-climateready-tech-hub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Miami Tech Works</u></a>, which aims to build a pipeline of tech talent in South Florida, is set to receive $6 million for workforce development programs while the Miami-Dade County government will get $3.2 million for governance and oversight. Two private companies working on advanced concrete products, Titan America and Carbon Limit, are also getting a portion of the FIU funding — $740,000 for Carbon Limit and an undisclosed amount for Titan.</p><p>Tim Sperry, CEO of Carbon Limit, is used to getting questions about why he based his early-stage startup out of Florida, his home state. “Great that you guys are a climate tech company, but why would you be in South Florida?” Sperry said people wonder. “Florida at all was a bad look for climate tech companies until this hub actually came together,” he told me. Since the hub was <a href="https://www.eda.gov/news/press-release/2024/07/02/South-Florida-ClimateReady-Tech-Hub#:~:text=In%20October%202023%2C%20South%20Florida,in%20critical%20technologies%20and%20industries." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>initially announced</u></a> last October, Sperry says he’s seen more money for climate tech flowing into the state. </p><p>Carbon Limit has a patented powder additive for concrete mixes, which enhances concrete’s natural ability to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and sequester it permanently, thereby reducing the carbon intensity of built infrastructure such as buildings and roads. So far the company has worked with the Minnesota Department of Transportation to pave a section of interstate highway, and <a href="https://startup.google.com/alumni/stories/carbon-limit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>with Google</u></a> to pave a portion of its campus. Carbon Limit raised a $1 million pre-seed round two years ago, and its business model revolves around licensing the formula for its additive to concrete producers.</p><p>Sperry sees Florida as “ground zero” for climate-related natural disasters, and thus a natural home for this type of technology. When he worked in Miami, he saw people kayaking down the streets during king tides, and found crabs in his office after floods. “They actually raised the road four feet and put pumps and did all this stuff down there. So I think, why shouldn’t it be South Florida?” he asked, “Short of the government stuff …” </p><p>Ah yes, the government stuff. While DeSantis hasn’t weighed in publicly on the ClimateReady Tech Hub, Covey said the state’s DeSantis-appointed Chief Resilience Officer, Wesley Brooks, is supportive. Brooks helped craft the “state support” section of the hub’s application, which calls the Office of Resilience “an advocate for the Hub and an ally in providing technical guidance to local governments.”</p><p>Climate tech startups can’t eat guidance, however. If the hub is going to accomplish its lofty technical and workforce development goals, it’s going to need a lot more than $19.5 million, and a lack of state-level support could make securing additional funds that much more difficult.</p><p>“We requested $70 million,” Covey told me, the maximum amount of federal funding that tech hubs could apply for. Most of the <a href="https://www.eda.gov/news/press-release/2024/07/02/biden-harris-administration-announces-next-funding-round-504-million" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>other hubs</u></a> received between $40 million and $50 million, putting the South Florida hub at the small end of the bunch. Covey said the county didn’t receive feedback as to why. “The way that we’re looking at $19.5 [million] is that this is our first investment tranche. We will be going back to the federal government. We will be going back to private funders. We will be going back to philanthropic funders in order to achieve our metrics,” she told me. </p><p>Ultimately, Miami-Dade County wants to leverage the ClimateReady Tech Hub to create 23,000 green jobs with an average base salary of $83,000 over a 10-year period. Thus far, Miami-Dade has raised an additional $500,000 — not nothing, but far from its ultimate goal of raising another $50 million. The increasing probability of a Trump win in November could put future federal funding for the hub at the whims of a notoriously mercurial and climate-adverse cabinet. </p><p>But if the tech hub does achieve its goals, Covey estimates the payoff will be huge, adding $41 billion to the region’s GDP. Given all the growth South Florida has seen over the last four years, with entrepreneurs and venture capitalists <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/why-miami-is-the-next-hot-tech-hub/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>flooding into the region</u></a> during the pandemic, Covey thinks the hub’s got a real shot of securing the money it needs. She even told me she views South Florida as “the most competitive place when it comes to climate technology.”</p><p>When I noted that the San Francisco Bay Area might beg to differ, Covey emphasized how much it matters that Miami-Dade County is experiencing the impacts of climate change in real time. “The Bay Area doesn’t have those sort of real life testing conditions that we have here. We have $3.5 trillion exposed to climate change right now,” she told me, citing a figure from a <a href="https://www.nwf.org/~/media/PDFs/Global-Warming/Reports/Changing-Tides_FINAL_LOW-RES-081516.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National Wildlife Federation report</u></a> showing that out of all the cities in the world, Miami stands to lose the most from coastal flooding. In other words, in South Florida climate tech isn’t a matter of theoretical tinkering and ideating. As Covey says, “Our economy depends on it.”</p>

## Navy exonerates 256 Black sailors unjustly punished after deadly 1944 explosion

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Navy has exonerated 256 Black sailors who were found to be unjustly punished in 1944 following a horrific port explosion that killed hundreds of service members and exposed racist double standards among the then-segregated ranks. 


On July 17, 1944, munitions being loaded onto a cargo ship detonated, causing secondary blasts that ignited 5,000 tons (4,535 metric tonnes) of explosives at Port Chicago naval weapons station near San Francisco. 


The explosion killed 320 sailors and civilians, nearly 75% of whom were Black, and injured another 400 personnel. Surviving Black sailors had to pick up the human remains and clear the blast site while white officers were granted leave to recuperate. 


The pier was a critical ammunition supply site for forces in the Pacific during World War II, and the job of loading those ships was left primarily to Black enlisted sailors overseen by white officers. 


Before the explosion, the Black sailors working the dock had expressed concerns about the loading operations. Shortly after the blast, they were ordered to return to loading ships even though no changes had been made to improve their safety. 


The sailors refused, saying they needed training on how to more safely handle the bombs before they returned. 




What followed affected the rest of their lives, including punishments that kept them from receiving honorable discharges even as the vast majority returned to work at the pier under immense pressure and served throughout the war. Fifty sailors who held fast to their demands for safety and training were tried as a group on charges of conspiracy to commit mutiny and were convicted and sent to prison. 


The whole episode was unjust, and none of the sailors received the legal due process they were owed, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in an interview with The Associated Press. 


It was "a horrific situation for those Black sailors that remained," Del Toro said. The Navy's office of general counsel reviewed the military judicial proceedings used to punish the sailors and found "there were so many inconsistencies and so many legal violations that came to the forefront," he said. 


Thurgood Marshall, who was then a defense attorney for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, defended the 50 sailors who were convicted of mutiny. Marshall went on to become the first Black justice on the Supreme Court. 




On Wednesday, the 80th anniversary of the Port Chicago disaster, Del Toro signed paperwork officially clearing the sailors, who are now deceased. Del Toro handed the first pen to Thurgood Marshall Jr., the late justice's son. 


The exonerations "are deeply moving," Marshall Jr. said. "They, of course, are all gone, and that's a painful aspect of it. But so many fought for so long for that kind of fairness and recognition." 


The events have stung surviving family members for decades, but an earlier effort in the 1990s to pardon the sailors fell short. Two additional sailors were previously cleared — one was found mentally incompetent to stand trial, and one was cleared on insufficient evidence. Wednesday's action goes beyond a pardon and vacates the military judicial proceedings carried out in 1944 against all of the men. 


"This decision clears their names and restores their honor and acknowledges the courage that they displayed in the face of immense danger," Del Toro said. 


The racism that the Black sailors faced reflected the military's views at the time — ranks were segregated, and the Navy had only reluctantly opened some positions it considered less desirable to Black service members. 


The official court of inquiry looking into why the explosion occurred cleared all the white officers and praised them for the "great effort" they had to exert to run the dock. It left open the suggestion that the Black sailors were to blame for the accident. 


Del Toro's action converts the discharges to honorable unless there were other circumstances surrounding them. After the Navy upgrades the discharges, surviving family members can work with the Department of Veterans Affairs on past benefits that may be owed, the Navy said.

## Ethicswishing

                <div class="e-content">
<p>[<a href="https://berjon.com/ethicswishing/">Robin Berjon</a>]</p><p>This is somewhere between a call to action and a wake-up call:</p><blockquote><p>"If you wish to be moral, you have to also pay attention to whether what you're doing actually works. And the best way to do that is to set up a forcing function for it: that's what checks and balances do."</p><p>"[...] Imagination isn't just a trite word to make your heart glow in pulp-class young-adult dystopia — imagination is the ability to depict justice, to see what we ought to aspire to. It is not a gift but rather a skill to hone."</p></blockquote><p>There is an inherent question here about how you can create binding systems that enforce ethical standards - but also, how you can determine which ethical standards actually lead to the outcomes you want to establish.</p><p>I think there's a lot here that can be addressed through more distributed equity. As Robin says, "anywhere a powerful entity operates it is at risk of unethical behavior and therefore must be held in check by a control mechanism". One system of control - insufficient in itself but I think still necessary - is to ensure that power is spread among more people who are more connected to the effects of that power.</p><p>Distributing equity literally means handing over the means of production not just to workers but to those impacted by the work, reconnecting the decisions to their consequences. I don't know that you <em>can</em> have ethical tech that is motivated by centralized power. As Robin implies: so far, it hasn't worked.</p>

## The Republican Party embraces crypto

Plus, dinners in Spain tend to start pretty darn late — after 9 p.m. on average. One reason is that the working day runs deep into the evening. But could things be changing?</p>

	The train delays have affected an especially large population. The Northeast Corridor is the most trafficked commuter rail system in the country, with over 750,000 daily commuters. In late June, Amtrak notified customers that trains in the corridor could face delays of up to an hour in the coming weeks as heat interfered with tracks and overhead power lines. Since it issued that warning, tens of thousands of people have experienced heat-related delays.

	Amtrak estimates that severe weather, including extreme heat, storms, and floods, will incur $220 million in lost revenue in the coming decade. That will only compound problems for the beleaguered rail company, which is facing a backlog of $45 billion in Northeast Corridor repairs, 
	<em><em>Fortune</em></em> <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/10/amtrak-upgrades-aging-rail-network-bridges-tunnels-infrastructure-bill-federal-funding/" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>. Some of the corridor’s bridges and tunnels were built more than a century ago, and the price tag for repairs has been accumulating for years.

	Making the necessary infrastructure improvements won’t just mean replacing old equipment with new. It will also require that new equipment be able to withstand high temperatures that were far less common just a decade ago. Solids, and especially metals, expand in the heat, which can warp rail lines if they’re not protected against high temperatures. Overhead power lines, meanwhile, tend to sag on hot days, Mikhail Chester, the director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, told me. Most light rail lines have counterweights to balance that sag, but those often aren’t heavy enough to counteract the extreme effects of high heat.

	Asphalt, too, tends to expand and soften in the heat, causing headaches for motorists and road crews. In

	While cities in the Southeast and Southwest have also reckoned with heat-related challenges, it’s notable that many of the most pronounced infrastructure meltdowns recently have occurred in ordinarily cooler parts of the country. The reasons are twofold, Chester told me. First, cities in the hottest part of the country tend to be newer, meaning they built more of their base infrastructure in more recent (and warmer) decades. Second, these cities are simply more used to the heat. In Phoenix, it’s not unusual for a summer day to top 110 degrees Fahrenheit — on Friday, when I spoke to Chester, it reached 116 degrees. That kind of heat poses an undeniable risk to outdoor workers, young athletes, and under-resourced populations, Chester said, but it also means that civil engineers build infrastructure with heat in mind.
</p><p>
	In Phoenix, “the infrastructure is much more designed to the environments — these high temperatures — than a place like Rhode Island is,” Chester said. Whereas Phoenix has always been hot, the climate in the Northeast is “significantly different at this point, climate change being one of those major changes.”
</p><center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet">I appreciated the ironic signs warning me of deadly floods as I ran this morning in the brutal Phoenix desert heat <a href="https://t.co/dKiZtCmL8s">pic.twitter.com/dKiZtCmL8s</a><br/>— Chet Haase (@chethaase) <a href="https://twitter.com/chethaase/status/1812542711137964206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></center><p>
	That’s not to say Southwestern infrastructure is anything close to heatproof. Researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory found that pavement temperatures on Phoenix streets frequently exceed 120 degrees on hot days, with many reaching between 140 and 160 degrees. Skin-to-pavement contact at those temperatures can cause severe burns; one Arizona burn center saw a 60% uptick in severe contact burns between 2022 and 2023, 
	<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2024/07/10/heat-sidewalks-roads-burns-nasa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Axios</em></em></u><u> reported</u></a>.
</p><p>
	National media coverage of climate-resilient infrastructure tends to focus on large federal legislation such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, but the standards set by professional societies like the American Society of Civil Engineers are at least as — if not more — influential, and far less sensitive to the ebbs and flows of national politics. Though not legally binding, these standards are often used as a model for local licensing authorities.
</p><p>
	“A lot of states and regions and cities in the United States will look to those guidelines to adapt,” Chester said.

## Innovation in news is an oxymoron

date: 2024-07-17, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>If you’re waiting for permission to build something, or if you want to see how well something has worked for your peers or competitors before you implement it yourself, you will never, ever innovate.</p><p>That’s the trap that news media seems to be in: nobody wants to be the first to build something new. Perhaps it’s that times are so dire that experimentation feels like too much of a risk; perhaps it’s just an extension of top-down editorial culture. But there’s nothing out-there in media technology right now. I’m aware of some stuff coming down the pipe that I’m really excited about, but the most innovative thing that’s actually been <em>shipped</em> is getting people to subscribe by addicting them to puzzle games. Forgive me for thinking that’s not particularly exciting.</p><p>How can the news industry break out of its shell? How can it act like technology is something that it can shape, rather than something that just happens to it? How can it put value not just in product management but actual nuts-and-bolts technical innovation?</p><p>This feels existentially important.</p><p>Thinking about it. Working on it. I know I’m not alone.</p></div>

## Todoist is really good

date: 2024-07-17, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>I’m, uh, <em>very bad</em> at task management. I wouldn’t want to pathologize, but I’ve never been a particularly <em>organized</em> person. I’ve always aspired to be more organized, but I’ve never found a tool or a methodology that really works for me. They were either too rigid and opinionated or brought too much overhead: I had to remember to use them, and that was enough of a blocker to not.</p><p>Over the last two months, everything has — weirdly — changed.</p><p>Someone mentioned <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> over on Threads, and although I had a vague memory of trying it years ago and it not working for me, I decided to install it again. Maybe it was just the right time for me now, or maybe the design has evolved, but it clicked pretty much immediately.</p><p>There are two things that make it great:</p><ol><li>It’s everywhere I work</li>
<li>It gets the hell out of my way</li>
</ol><p>Whenever I need to remember to do something, I press a key combo — I’ve configured shift-command-T — and a modal lets me quickly tap it in using relatively natural language. That’s a similar workflow to what I’ve been doing with <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> for years and years, so adding this new combo isn’t a giant feat of muscle memory.</p><p><img src="https://werd.io/file/6697c7322274fc298e0379b2/thumb.png" alt="Todoist modal" width="1024" height="340"></p><p>Then, whenever I want to check what’s on my plate, I can bring up the app (desktop via ctrl-command-T, or phone), or click the toolbar icon in my browser to bring up the browser extension version. Because I spend most of my life in my browser, that’s particularly handy. It’s just <em>always there</em>.</p><p><img src="https://werd.io/file/6697c74220dfe2a1880b1a32/thumb.png" alt="Todoist desktop app" width="1024" height="792"></p><p>I’ve found myself adding new tasks via modal while I’ve been in meetings, so I don’t forget to follow up. Or I’ll be in a Google Doc and add a task the same way. (There’s a way to automatically sync Google Tasks with Todoist, but I don’t use that — I’d rather have direct control over my task inbox.)</p><p>It’s made me more productive, more organized, and as a result, much less anxious. And I feel really good about it.</p><p>This post isn’t an ad, by the way. It’s just so rare that I really love a piece of software, so I thought I’d let you know.</p></div>

COP29 president says new climate finance goal will be summit’s top priority</h3><p>The agenda for this year’s COP29 U.N. climate summit is coming into view. This morning the COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev (who is Azerbaijan’s environment minister as well as a former state oil company exec), published a letter outlining the “plan and expectations” for the event, which will be held in Baku, Azerbaijan’s capital. While the top priority is to agree “a fair and ambitious” New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance, “this is not just our priority,” Babayev wrote, adding: “We all must go the extra mile together to deliver this historic milestone.” The letter urges nations to put forward new National Determined Contributions that are in keeping with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree Celsius warming limit, submit climate adaptation plans, and finalize Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/what-you-need-know-about-article-6-paris-agreement?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-89D7cBPS3i-xYXA0XQ6VbOkbKyEjWOd1gOBs_1yfTs5vXe1y-YYjBk5zZaHQx12qQ9Stg4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sets out</a> “how countries can reduce their emissions using international carbon markets.” </p><p>There are several references to Azerbaijan “leading by example” but the underlying message is one of shared responsibility between nations to tackle the climate crisis.

GB Energy will not supply electricity directly to households. Instead, it will receive £8 billion (about $10.4 billion – which will come partly from increased taxes on oil and gas companies) to own and operate clean energy assets alongside the private sector, “financing and helping to build low-carbon infrastructure,” <em><em>The Guardian </em></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/06/could-labour-gb-energy-plan-future-proof-power-generation-uk?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-89D7cBPS3i-xYXA0XQ6VbOkbKyEjWOd1gOBs_1yfTs5vXe1y-YYjBk5zZaHQx12qQ9Stg4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>.

## Lunch break

date: 2024-07-17, from: Rachel Kwon blog

I never had a regular &ldquo;lunch break&rdquo; until recently. Early in my career it was not by choice — in surgery training there&rsquo;s really no such thing as a break, only a stolen minute or two here and there to pee or wolf down whatever food you can scrounge or nap in a chair if it&rsquo;s the middle of the night and you&rsquo;re on call. We did get a $5 meal coupon for the hospital cafeteria which could get you a cup of terrible coffee and a bagel drier than a bag of silica gel in the Sahara desert.

## The benefits — and costs — of hosting a political convention

date: 2024-07-17, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>According to Milwaukee&#8217;s visitors bureau, hosting the Republican National Convention this week comes with $200 million in additional economic activity. But that figure doesn&#8217;t include business lost when locals try to avoid the crowds. Plus, stock prices wake up with a hangover. And later, it&#8217;s day 2 of Amazon Prime Day. Today, we check in on Amazon&#8217;s pledge to spend $1.2 billion to provide free job training to about 300,000 employees.</p>

## How to Decarbonize the World’s Biggest Ships

date: 2024-07-17, from: Heatmap News

<em>Jesse is on vacation until August, so this is a special, Rob-only summer episode of Shift Key.</em>
</p><p class="drop-caps">
Shipping is the backbone of the modern economy. At least 80% of all goods worldwide are shipped as ocean cargo, and the global economy rises and falls on the free movement of gigantic ships across the sea. But container ships and bulk carriers burn what’s known as bunker fuel, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels. The international shipping industry generates 3% of global carbon emissions, a proportion that’s projected to rise through the century.
</p><p>
Most proposals to decarbonize ocean freight have focused on using ammonia or other zero-carbon liquid fuels. But Fleetzero, a Bill Gates-backed startup, is trying to use the only technology that it says can get cheap enough to compete with oil: batteries. The Alabama-based company is building batteries big enough to hybridize — and, eventually, power outright — the world’s largest ships.
</p><p>
This week, Rob chats with Steven Henderson, the cofounder and CEO of Fleetzero and a graduate of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. They talk about Steven’s history in the oil and gas industry, why batteries will beat liquid fuels, and how to put out a fire in the middle of the ocean.
</p><p>
This episode of Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Steven Henderson:</strong> What’s good about batteries, you can step into that, where you can use existing infrastructure and build on it. You don’t need a new fundamental technology to do this. The numbers to do this are not outside the realm of possibility.And if you think about it in terms of global … it’s about one-fifth of what you would need for electric cars and trucks.<br/>
<br/>
So it’s not — yeah, these are big numbers. But if you think about an electric future, this is one of many parts, you know, so this is not going to be the hardest part on the grid. In fact, it’s a bunch easier because you don’t have to go send it across the country, and there are generating capabilities in and around ports, and you can use existing stuff.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I would imagine even switching a ship from bunker fuel to electricity generated by natural gas, which is often just right there would be …<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Henderson: </strong>Yeah, it’s a huge savings from carbon. And honestly, if you went to coal, it’s still cleaner. Ships, because of just the way they operate, there’s CO2 emissions, but it’s a huge SOx and NOx, it’s a sulfur and nitrous oxides emission. And at least with a stationary coal powered plant, at least in the West, there’s regulations on what you can send out the stack. When you’re in the middle of the ocean, these things, you know, sometimes they’re choking up some pretty nasty stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So it’s an advantage, even if you go from coal. Obviously, we hope that all electricity coming into this is going to be clean over time. But if you suddenly have, 
	<em><em>oh, I need 100 megawatts of power, and I need to, you know, swap out this power plant</em></em> — well, what if I need 300 megawatts of power? Now I’m going to build a new power plant, and the economics on that are going to stand on their own, and I can build it clean from the beginning, so I don’t have to scrap the existing infrastructure to make the grid clean. <br/>
<br/>
	So that’s why it’s super important to electrify the consumers, and that increased demand on the grid is how you clean up the grid.

## Increased security around Trump is apparent, agents wall him off from RNC crowds

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

Milwaukee —  On the floor of the Republican National Convention Tuesday evening, vice presidential candidate JD Vance greeted and shook hands with excited delegates as he walked toward his seat.


It was a marked contrast from former President Donald Trump, who entered the hall a few minutes later and was separated from supporters by a column of Secret Service agents. His ear still bandaged after an attempted assassination, Trump closely hugged the wall. Instead of handshakes or hellos for those gathered, he offered fist pumps to the cameras.


The contrast underscores the new reality facing Trump after a gunman opened fire at his rally in Pennsylvania Saturday, raising serious questions about the agency that is tasked with protecting the president, former presidents and major-party candidates. Trump's campaign must also adjust to a new reality after he came millimeters from death or serious injury — and as law enforcement warns of the potential for more political violence.


Trump campaign officials declined to comment on the stepped-up security and how it might impact his interactions going forward.


“We do not comment on President Trump’s security detail. All questions should be directed to the United States Secret Service,” said Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung.


Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose agency oversees the Secret Service, said Monday that he could not discuss “specifics of the protection or the enhancements made, as they involve sensitive tactics and procedures. I can say, however, that personnel and other protective resources, technology, and capabilities have been added.”


The Secret Service had already stepped up Trump's protection in the days before the attack following an unrelated threat from Iran, two U.S. officials said Tuesday. But that extra security didn't stop the gunman, who fired from an adjacent roof, from killing one audience member and injuring two others along with Trump.


The FBI and Homeland Security officials remain “concerned about the potential for follow-on or retaliatory acts of violence following this attack,” according to a joint intelligence bulletin by Homeland Security and the FBI and obtained by The Associated Press. The bulletin warned that lone actors and small groups will “continue to see rallies and campaign events as attractive targets.”


Underscoring the security risks, a man armed with an AK-47 pistol, wearing a ski mask and carrying a tactical backpack was taken into custody Monday near the Fiserv Forum, where the convention is being held.


The attack has led to stepped-up security not only for Trump. President Joe Biden’s security has also been bolstered, with more agents surrounding him as he boarded Air Force One to Las Vegas on Monday night. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also received Secret Service protection in the shooting’s wake.


Trump's campaign has also responded in other ways, including placing armed security at all hours outside their offices in Florida and Washington, D.C.


Trump has already scheduled his next rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Saturday. That's where he will appear with Vance for their first event as a presidential ticket.


But the new posture complicates, at least for now, the interactions Trump regularly has with supporters as he signs autographs, shakes hands and poses for selfies at events and on airplane tarmacs.

## Washington-Seoul alliance is a ‘nuclear alliance,’ US official says

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A high-ranking U.S. official stressed Tuesday that the U.S.-South Korea alliance is a “nuclear alliance,” reinforcing the South Korean government’s description of the two allies, after the United States and South Korea signed new deterrence guidelines last week.


Vipin Narang, U.S. acting assistant secretary of defense for Space Policy, told VOA’s Korean Service in an exclusive interview that “when we formally extend nuclear deterrence to our allies, it is a nuclear alliance, and South Korea is an example of that.”


Narang explained that it would be similar to what the United States has with the European allies through NATO.


“NATO publicly says, for example, that so long as nuclear weapons exist, NATO will be a nuclear alliance. And the relationship with ROK, similarly, is a formal extension of U.S. nuclear,” he said, referring to South Korea with the abbreviated form of its official name, the Republic of Korea. “We commit to defend South Korea with all capabilities.”


South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said earlier on Tuesday in a Cabinet meeting that South Korea’s alliance with the United States has been upgraded to a “nuclear-based alliance,” adding that the U.S nuclear assets will now be “specially assigned to missions on the Korean Peninsula” under the newly agreed guidelines between the two allies.


On Thursday, Yoon met U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington, reaffirming their commitments to the Washington Declaration unveiled in 2023, which outlines the two countries’ commitment to engage in deeper dialogue and information sharing to strengthen nuclear deterrence efforts on the Korean Peninsula.


According to the joint statement released after the two leaders’ latest meeting, Biden reiterated that the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence to South Korea is backed by “the full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear.”


In line with such a move, Narang, who co-chairs the Nuclear Consultative Group, a bilateral body set up by the United States and South Korea under the Washington Declaration, met his South Korean counterpart, Cho Chang Lae, in Washington last week and signed “the United States and Republic of Korea Guidelines for Nuclear Deterrence and Nuclear Operations on the Korean Peninsula.”


The guidelines, according to the Department of Defense, provide principles and procedures to assist policymakers and military officials of both countries “in maintaining an effective nuclear deterrence policy and posture.”


Narang emphasized that the guidelines would help the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) evolve in accordance with the threats faced by the U.S.-South Korea alliance.


“The guidelines document is the not the end, it’s the beginning, and sort of sets up the NCG as an enduring body,” he said. “The NCG is a living body, and the work streams evolve with the threat environment and the capabilities, just as North Korea's capabilities continue to expand and diversify.”


However, he made it clear that only the U.S. president will be able to authorize the use and employment of U.S. nuclear weapons, while underscoring Washington and Seoul will be approaching the extended deterrence “as equal partners.”


“We have extended deterrence relationships. We need conventional support from our allies,” he stressed.


His remarks come amid growing skepticism in South Korea over the U.S. extended deterrence, especially after Russia and North Korea signed a defense pact, which indicated Moscow’s willingness to engage in full-fledged military cooperation with Pyongyang.


An increasing number of South Korean people are calling for South Korea’s own nuclear weapons, arguing that the U.S.-ROK alliance’s existing deterrence strategy would not be enough to protect South Korea from the possible attacks from North Korea, if it joins hands with Russia.




The acting assistant secretary of defense gave a strong warning against South Korea having its own nuclear weapons.


“It would be in violation of the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty),” Narang said, adding that South Korea would probably face international sanctions.


He also suggested that Seoul would be “an international pariah” and would become vulnerable to North Korea’s nuclear attacks during the time it is pursuing nuclear weapons.


Experts in Washington remained cautious about what the new guidelines could mean for the extended deterrence for South Korea.


“It shows that the United States is taking seriously South Korea as a partner in all aspects of defense,” said Scott Snyder, president of Korea Economic Institute of America.


Snyder told VOA’s Korean Service on Tuesday that the decision to employ a nuclear weapon should be made in a closely integrated manner between Seoul and Washington.


“If it’s not integrated, the alliance will fail,” he said.


He added that the decision will heavily depend on the U.S. inclination.


Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, told VOA’s Korean Service on Tuesday that it is difficult to see the U.S.-South Korea alliance as a “nuclear alliance.”


“If South Korea has been given a role in planning the nuclear options, yes, but the U.S. has been implying that that hasn’t occurred,” Bennett said.


“If they are a nuclear alliance, then it ought to describe in what way it’s a nuclear alliance – is South Korea being included in planning how nuclear weapons will be used? That’s what President Yoon asked for. It’s not clear to me.”

## Republicans lean into Trump's border message during a convention night focused on immigration

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

MILWAUKEE — Immigration took center stage as the Republican National Convention resumed Tuesday, with speakers spotlighting a key element of former President Donald Trump's political brand that helped endear him to the GOP base when he began his first campaign in 2015.


Among speakers slated for Tuesday night were families who've been impacted by violent crime — part of a GOP strategy to link crime to border policies. They include the family of Rachel Morin, a Maryland woman whom prosecutors say was killed and raped by a fugitive from El Salvador and whose story has been frequently highlighted by Trump on the campaign trail.


Immigration has long been one of Trump's banner issues, as he has criticized the unprecedented number of migrants entering the country illegally through the U.S. border with Mexico. The numbers of unauthorized crossings have fallen abruptly after President Joe Biden issued a rule suspending many asylum claims at the border.


At rallies and other campaign events, Trump has pointed to examples of migrants who committed heinous crimes and has blamed migration for the trafficking of drugs like fentanyl, even though federal data suggests many people smuggling fentanyl across the border are U.S. citizens. He has vowed to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.




Trump's anti-immigrant rhetoric has also strayed into talking points not backed by evidence, including unfounded claims that migrants are entering the country to vote in the 2024 election.


Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority leader, made that statement in his remarks, declaring, "Biden and Harris want illegals to vote now that they've opened up the border."


Senate candidates who were addressing the convention Tuesday not only blamed Biden for the number of migrants crossing the border, but just as often faulted Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Republicans have increasingly focused on amid speculation that she could replace Biden as the Democratic nominee after the president's poor debate performance.


The GOP candidates, mindful of their own races, sought to blame their Democratic opponents as well. Pennsylvania candidate David McCormick, for example, tied in his challenger, Sen. Bob Casey, with the term "Biden-Harris-Casey wide open borders."


Kari Lake, the party's Senate candidate in Arizona, stuck to a message that appealed largely to the GOP base and her reputation as a former television news anchor turned conservative firebrand. She blasted the "fake news" for spending "the last eight years lying about President Donald Trump and his amazing patriotic supporters." She also blamed Biden and Democrats for the situation on the U.S.-Mexico border, saying they're "full of bad ideas."


In the latest signal the party is solidifying to take on Biden in November, several of Trump's fiercest GOP primary rivals will also speak Tuesday. They include former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.


Trump's survival of an attempted assassination Saturday at a rally in Pennsylvania was on the minds of many inside the hall. One of the delegates in the crowd could be seen with a folded white piece of paper over his ear — an apparent tribute to the bandage Trump wore when he entered the hall Monday to a roaring crowd.


Scalise, who was injured in a politically motivated shooting in 2017 while he was practicing for a charity baseball game, spoke of his own experience when he touched on Trump's attack.


"While I was fighting for my life, Donald Trump was one of the first to come to console my family at the hospital. That's the kind of leader he is. Courageous under fire, compassionate towards others," Scalise said.


In the wake of Saturday's attempt on Trump's life, there was a heightened focus on security at the convention, which drew thousands of people to downtown Milwaukee, including a number of high-profile elected officials.


A man armed with an AK-47 pistol and wearing a ski mask was taken into custody Monday, the convention's first day, near the Fiserv Forum where the convention is being held, a federal law enforcement official said Tuesday.


The 21-year-old was arrested after being encountered by U.S. Capitol Police and Homeland Security Investigations agents who said he was acting suspicious, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.


Police found the weapon in his backpack, the official said.


On Tuesday, five Ohio police officers who were in Wisconsin for the convention shot a man who was in a knife fight near the convention, killing him, Milwaukee's police chief said.


The man who police shot had a knife in each hand and refused police commands, Milwaukee Chief Jeffrey Norman said at a news conference. Two knives were recovered from the scene, the chief said.


Trump and Vance were expected to appear in the hall each of the last three nights of the convention. Vance will speak Wednesday and Trump will speak Thursday.


Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas said he hoped the assassination attempt on Trump would reset the tone nationally, beginning with Trump's scheduled remarks Thursday.


"After a brush with death, I do believe — going through that — that his message will be better, and I think will appeal to our better emotions," Tabas said in an interview after the Pennsylvania GOP's delegation breakfast in suburban Milwaukee.


Trump, who has long decried rivals with harsh language and talked about prosecuting opponents if he wins a second term, seemed poised to deliver a more toned-down speech. His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said in an Axios interview outside the RNC that he spent three or four hours going through his father's convention speech with him, "trying to de-escalate some of that rhetoric."


"I think it lasts," the younger Trump said of the change in his father's rhetoric. "There are events that change you for a couple minutes, and there are events that change you permanently."

## Iran's Islamist rulers silent on attempted assassination of Trump

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Iran's Islamist rulers have made no public comment on the attempted assassination of former U.S. President Donald Trump in the three days since the shooting attack on the man whom they have long seen as their nemesis and targeted with threats of vengeance since he left office. 


The only references in Iranian state media to Saturday's attack on Trump have been articles citing details of the shooting at his election rally in Pennsylvania, showing images of the aftermath and amplifying conspiracy theories about whether it was real or staged.


Iran has threatened revenge against Trump and his key aides for carrying out the January 2020 assassination of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in a Baghdad drone strike. It was part of what Trump called a campaign of "maximum pressure" against Tehran for its nuclear and other perceived malign activities.


Since then, one of the most explicit threats against Trump has come from Amir Ali Hajizadeh, aerospace chief of Iran's top military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He told state TV in February 2023 that "we are looking to kill Trump" to avenge Soleimani. 


There is no indication of Iranian involvement in the Trump rally shooting, with U.S. authorities naming only one suspect, the 20-year-old American male shooter whom U.S. Secret Service personnel shot and killed at the scene.


CNN reported on Tuesday that the Secret Service had increased security around Trump "in recent weeks" in response to an alleged Iranian assassination plot that U.S. authorities purportedly learned about from intelligence attributed to an unidentified "human source." 


The Washington Post and New York Times published their own reports on the alleged Iranian threat, sourcing it to unnamed U.S. officials. 


Iran's U.N. Mission in New York told VOA the accusations are "unsubstantiated and malicious."


"Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani. Iran has chosen the legal path to bring him to justice," the mission said in a statement.


U.S. Secret Service communications chief Anthony Guglielmi responded to the CNN report by telling VOA that his security agency and others are "constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action to adjust resources, as needed."


"We cannot comment on any specific threat stream other than to say that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds accordingly," Guglielmi wrote. 


One of the Iranian state media reports highlighting conspiracy theories about Saturday's incident was published by the IRGC-run Tasnim news agency on Sunday.


It published a collage of photos of the bloodied former president with a superimposed three-word headline in Persian: "Blood and pig."




Other state media articles published photos of Trump defiantly raising and pumping his fist to his supporters after Secret Service agents helped him to get back on his feet. 


Shahram Kholdi, an Iranian Canadian teacher of Middle East history at Canada's University of Waterloo, discussed Iran's state media coverage of the shooting in the Tuesday edition of VOA's Flashpoint Global Crises program.




The following interview transcript is edited for brevity and clarity. 


VOA: Why would Iran allow its state media to publish photos of the wounded former president showing what many Americans see as his triumphant stance in the face of danger?


Shahram Kholdi, University of Waterloo, Canada: The Iranian regime's hardcore supporters in the Basiji paramilitary force and the IRGC — the people who are willing to kill and die to keep this regime in power — they don't see what you see as a positive. They see the weakness, they see division in the American masses, they see fractures in the U.S. democratic system. And the regime actually uses those pictures of Trump to reinforce this propaganda trope that the U.S. is a facade of a democracy, that there is something more sinister happening behind the scenes.


We should not be surprised to see the Iranian regime's propaganda machine focus on such sinister scenarios in the next few weeks. Even though their propaganda machine is heavily equipped and well-manned, it has been only a few days since the shooting, and it takes time for them to churn out these kinds of stories.


VOA: Given Trump's record of being tough on Iran, does the Iranian leadership have any fear that highlighting his survival of an assassination attempt will boost his election prospects and return him to power?


Kholdi: Iranian officials are fearful of that. There has been an atypical restraint by officials who are generally quick to react and make all sorts of preposterous statements on such occasions. They did not do so this time. They are on their toes right now.


The regime's Chinese and Russian allies may have assured Tehran that if Trump is reelected, they will protect its interests in any negotiations with him.


President Joe Biden's failure to stop U.S.-sanctioned Iranian oil being from exported to China, and to stop Iran from assisting Russia's war effort in Ukraine, also has emboldened the regime.


But on the other hand, given the prospect of the Islamic republic once again facing the massive pressure campaign that Trump previously imposed on it, with a massive reduction in Iranian oil production and exports and interceptions of tankers, I think the regime is erring on the side of caution in its response to the assassination attempt. But the Chinese and Russians may have advised them to do so. I wouldn't attribute that to any impeccable wisdom on their part.

## Biden stands ground on gun policy, asks Americans to cool down

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

white house — With the recent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, the conversation around guns and gun policy is heating up — even as President Joe Biden is asking the country to cool down.


This is the first assassination attempt on a former or current U.S. president since 1981, when Ronald Reagan was shot


“First of all, that is preposterous,” said U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas when asked about rumors that the assassination attempt was an inside job involving the current administration.


“It is also dangerous to propagate rumors that are so unequivocally false and provocative,” he said at a Monday news briefing. “As the president so powerfully said to the entire nation, we have to tamp down the rhetoric in this country.”


U.S. gun policy may see particular focus in campaigns and debates in the final approach to the 2024 presidential election.


Biden, even before the recent shooting, has been a strong advocate for stricter gun policy.


Biden served as vice president under President Barack Obama, who tried to tighten gun policy following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary school that killed 26 people, mostly 6- and 7-year-olds, but was unable to pass major gun legislation.


After the Sandy Hook shooting, Obama asked Biden to lead a more concrete initiative on gun reform, and Biden met with a range of citizens to seek their thoughts on gun policy.


Trump has advocated a less stringent gun policy. His campaign calls for deregulation of firearms, and he has said he will undo some executive actions introduced by Biden.


White House reaffirms position


At the news briefing with Mayorkas on Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre affirmed Biden’s position on gun policy.


“The president has been, obviously, a strong advocate on gun control. He has been throughout his career as a senator, as vice president, as now as president,” Jean-Pierre said in answer to a question from VOA.


She noted that Congress in 2022 approved the first major gun safety legislation in 30 years. "The president led on that effort and was able to get that done. … The president has signed more than two dozen executive actions [on gun control],” she said.


'Lower the temperature'


This week, Biden has also condemned the recent violence, asking the country to minimize its divisiveness.


“We have to lower the temperature … there is no place in America for violence. It is important that we are really clear about that,” said Jean-Pierre when asked if Biden plans to tone down his political rhetoric.


The message from the White House comes after Biden called Trump a “threat to democracy” on several occasions. Trump has repeatedly said “you will not have a country” if Biden is re-elected.


J.D. Vance, Donald Trump’s recently chosen candidate for vice president, blamed Biden’s political rhetoric for the assassination attempt.


“Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination,” he posted on X shortly after the incident.


In a Monday interview with NBC News, Biden said he regretted saying “it was time to put Trump in the bull’s-eye.” But he defended saying that the former president is a “threat.”


“Look, how do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a president says things like he says?” Biden said in the interview


Some analysts doubt that Biden’s call for a calmer climate will bring about big changes to the political landscape.


“I think the immediate effect [after the shooting] is going to be that it will escalate violent rhetoric and that people are going to be more vehement and vocal in vilifying their political rivals,” Valentine said.


“Unfortunately, I think that’s where we’re at, and that’s what we’re beginning to see already.”


Anita Powell contributed to this report from the White House.

## Vice presidential nominee Vance calls China 'biggest threat to our country'

date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — In his short time in the U.S. Senate, J.D. Vance, the newly tapped Republican vice presidential nominee, has been a hawk on China.


He has introduced legislation to restrict Chinese access to U.S. financial markets and to protect U.S. higher education from Chinese influence.


In an interview with Fox News shortly after being named as former President Donald Trump’s running mate on Monday, Vance called China “the biggest threat” to the United States.


When asked about Russia’s war in Ukraine, Vance said Trump would negotiate with Moscow and Kyiv to “bring this thing to a rapid close so America can focus on the real issue, which is China.”


“That’s the biggest threat to our country and we are completely distracted from it,” said Vance, a staunch supporter of Trump’s Make America Great Again agenda.


The 39-year-old author and venture capitalist rose to fame with his 2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.” He advocates for a hands-off approach to foreign policy and is dubious about military intervention.


Tariffs and more tariffs


Both Trump and Vance have supported strong tariffs on China. In an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation” news program in May, Vance said the U.S. needs to apply across-the-board tariffs on imports.


“If you apply tariffs, really what it is you're saying [is] that we're going to penalize you for using slave labor in China and importing that stuff in the United States. What you end up doing is, you end up making more stuff in America, in Pennsylvania, in Ohio and in Michigan,” he said.


Trump has repeatedly accused China of stealing manufacturing jobs from the U.S., especially those jobs in the Midwestern part of the country.


“Vance has supported more economic restrictions and tariffs on Chinese imports and investments,” Dean Chen, a professor of political science at the Ramapo College of New Jersey, told VOA. “Hence, I expect his position on China to be in line with Trump nationalists in their potential new administration.”


Trump has promised that, if elected, he would impose 10% across-the-board levies on imported goods and a tariff of 60% or higher on Chinese goods to protect American industries.


Joel Goldstein, professor emeritus of law at Saint Louis University and an expert on the vice presidency, said Vance was selected because he is “a very loyal supporter who has embraced Trump's policies and style and who seems disposed to defend Trump's words and conduct.”


“The choice seems designed to appeal to Trump's MAGA base, not to unify the Republican Party or the nation,” he told VOA.


Taiwan


Experts say Vance might be more of an isolationist than Trump, as Vance was vehemently opposed to funding the war in Ukraine.


“He previously served as a U.S. Marine in Iraq and felt that the lessons from that war should prevent future entanglements,” Chen said.


Chen added that whether that attitude translates to lessened support for a Taiwan military contingency remains to be seen.


“We all know that Trump has been clear that he won't announce whether he would send troops to help Taiwan should Beijing invade the island democracy, saying that a lucid explanation would undercut his negotiating position,” he said. “I expect Vance to toe the same line as President Trump.”


Attracting Rust Belt voters


Vance was born on August 2, 1984, in Middletown, Ohio. He served in the Marine Corps before attending The Ohio State University and Yale Law School.


His 2016 bestselling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” detailed his family’s struggles with poverty, addiction and instability. The book focuses on the hardship faced by white working-class people in the Rust Belt — the manufacturing region in the U.S. that includes parts of the Northeast and Midwest and has experienced economic decline and population loss.


“Senator Vance’s life story and diverse accomplishments are impressive,” Karen Hult, a political science professor at Virginia Tech, told VOA.


“He not only is from a ‘red’ Republican state, but one that is near the battleground state of Pennsylvania and may be seen as appealing to many more rural and smaller town residents in much of the Middle West,” Hult said.


In the 2020 presidential election, Trump lost Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, three important swing states along the Rust Belt.


Hult said that in most presidential elections, the choice of running mates makes little difference in voting results.


“That, of course, may differ in 2024, given the age of the two major party candidates and in light of Saturday's assassination attempt,” she added.
