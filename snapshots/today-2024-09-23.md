## How to Decarbonize Your Life

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY1Mzg1NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjA4OTMwOH0.4yxx3a-4gCcnkDJBuDQgKeCmJfFrrgkisP72a7Un4-c/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=147%2C0%2C253%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Welcome to <strong>Decarbonize Your Life, </strong>Heatmap’s special report that aims to help you make decisions in your own life that are better for the climate, better for you, and better for the world we all live in.<br/>
</p><p>
	This is our attempt, in other words, to assist you in living something like a normal life while also making progress in the fight against climate change. That means making <em><em>smarter and more informed decisions </em></em>about how climate change affects your life — and about how your life affects climate change. The point is not what you shouldn’t do (although there is some of that). It’s about what you <em><em>should</em></em> do to exert the most leverage on the global economic system and, hopefully, nudge things toward decarbonization just a little bit faster.
</p><h3>A better way to think about individual action</h3><p>
	Isn’t that a little silly? At this point, everyone knows that individual action won’t solve climate change. Didn’t BP <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/23/big-oil-coined-carbon-footprints-to-blame-us-for-their-greed-keep-them-on-the-hook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>invent</u></a> the term “carbon footprint” in 2004 so as to distract from fossil fuel companies’ guilt and greed?
</p><p>
	As the journalist Rachel Cohen <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/368201/volunteer-charity-donations-systemic-change-activism-nonprofits-loneliness-philanthropy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has observed</u></a>, around the 2010s it became unpopular to believe that individual action could help address <em><em>any </em></em>major social problem. And sure, it’s true that only collective action — achieved through something like the political system — will let us eventually manage climate change at the global level.
</p><p>
	But at Heatmap, we believe that that isn’t quite the whole story. Just because politics and collective action are the only things that can <em><em>solve </em></em>climate change doesn’t mean they are the only things that can <em><em>do something</em></em> about climate change. What’s more, the problem of carbon emissions — and the stickiness of fossil fuels — emerges from a tight knot of chemical efficiency, political power, and logistical lock-in. If individual consumers can pry at that knot, can make it a little easier to imagine a post-fossil energy system, then they can realize a zero-carbon world a little sooner.
</p><h3>High-leverage actions, not just low emissions</h3><p>
	That way of thinking about climate change, however, requires us to think somewhat differently about how to take individual action in the first place. Often, when you read about how to fight climate change as a person or family, the advice assumes that you want to reduce your <em><em>responsibility </em></em>for climate change. You’re advised to turn down the thermostat in the winter (or turn it up in the summer), shut off the lights when you leave the room, and compost.

<div class="highlight-author">Robinson Meyer</div></div></div></div></div><p>
	This advice assumes that the reader’s goal is to personally exculpate themselves or their family from global warming — and to assuage their own guilt for participating in a polluting system.
</p><p>
	At its most sophisticated, this advice can be valuable insofar as it can help you cut your marginal carbon emissions. The most precise versions of these recommendations often speak in terms of emissions abatement: They might advise, say, that switching to a plant-based diet <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230421-what-are-the-best-ways-to-reduce-carbon-footprint" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>could save</u></a> 0.8 tons of carbon emissions a year.
</p><p>
	You’ll see some of that kind of recommendation in this project: It’s a valid way to think about individual actions, and it works especially well in some domains, such as food. But it’s not, in our view, the best way of thinking about individual action to fight climate change.
</p><p>
	That’s because it is essentially impossible to exculpate yourself from climate change. I don’t mean that in a fatalistic way. It’s just a fact. Simply by living in the year 2024, your life is enmeshed in a sprawling economic network that devours fossil fuels as its great lifestyle subsidy. Look out the nearest window — do you see cars, asphalt, power lines, sidewalks, buildings? Do you see steel-framed structures or a plane cutting its way across the sky? None of those things could exist without fossil fuels. And unless you’re looking into wild and unkempt wilderness (if so, lucky you!), then even the <em><em>plants </em></em>and <em><em>grass </em></em>out your window, the food in your pantry, grew up on fertilizer that was <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/whats-wrong-fossil-fuel-based-fertilizer#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>manufactured with fossil fuels</u></a>. If you live in a rich or middle-income country, buy goods and clothes, eat food, use electricity, or even <em><em>leave your house </em></em>by any means other than walking, then you are responsible, to some degree, for climate change.
</p><p>
	Trying to zero out your personal carbon footprint, in other words, is a fool’s errand. What you <em><em>can </em></em>do, however, is maximize the degree to which you’re building a new, post-fossil-fuel world.
</p><p>
	To be clear, I don’t mean that in a woo-woo way. I’m not saying you should imagine a kumbaya world where we all hold hands and take public transit to the nearest all-volunteer renewable-powered co-op. I’m saying that there are real, already existing products and technologies that must become a bigger part of today’s built environment if we are to have any hope of solving climate change. What you can do — and what we recommend in this guide — is help take those technologies from the fringes into the center of everyday life. If you want to decarbonize the whole planet, you should think about decarbonizing your life.
</p><p>
	What we have tried to do here is not focus on how to reduce your <em><em>marginal </em></em>emissions — the number of tons that you, personally, are responsible for pumping into the environment. Instead, we’re trying to help you understand how to focus on high-<em><em>leverage </em></em>actions — the kinds of choices that can drive change throughout the energy system. That’s why in this guide you’ll find advice on how to switch to an EV, buy zero-carbon electricity, make your home more energy-efficient, and electrify your appliances. We also recommend these in the order that we think they’ll be most effective — to learn more about how we reached that ranking, read about our methodology here.
</p><p>
	The kind of shifts we advise in this guide, to be clear, won’t solve climate change on their own. But they will help you alter the systems in which you’re enmeshed, and they’ll make you a smarter climate citizen.
</p><h3>What about flying?</h3><p>
	Flying is maybe the trickiest climate question. Although it makes up a relatively small share of both global and U.S. emissions — about 2% each — it is among the most climate-polluting activities many Americans will do on a minute-to-minute basis. (Although if you live in a dense and walkable city like New York, San Francisco, or Washington, D.C., but travel frequently, then flying may make up a large share of your emissions.) It is probably also the most difficult “everyday” activity to decarbonize.
</p><p>
	There is no practical substitute for long-distance or transcontinental flying. Today, <a href="https://www.seat61.com/queen-mary-2-transatlantic.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only one ocean liner</u></a> regularly makes the journey from New York to London, and it departs from each city only once a month. And unless you hitch a ride on a container ship, there is literally no slow boat to China. If you want to travel abroad, then you must fly. Even within the United States, there is <em><em>essentially </em></em>no substitute for long-distance flights. Europeans and East Asians can rely on superior long-distance rail systems, but America’s extensive road network, <a href="https://www.hsrail.org/blog/why-transit-projects-cost-more-in-the-u-s-than-almost-anywhere-else-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20U.S.%20is%20the,than%20building%20rail%20at%20grade." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>unusually high infrastructure costs</u></a>, sclerotic rail agency, and chronic lack of transit investment mean that Americans are stuck with flying or driving.
</p><p>
	Commercial aviation is a miracle of the modern world: It facilitates a level of global connectedness and international communication that earlier generations could only dream of. Affordable and long-distance passenger flight is, in many ways, the crowning achievement of our highly technical society, and it allows for the amount of global immigration and mass tourism that defines the modern world. (If you have a private jet, of course, stop using it. Because so few people take each flight, private jets are uniquely destructive for the climate, emitting <a href="https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/private-jets-can-the-super-rich-supercharge-zero-emission-aviation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>every seven hours </u></a>what the average American emits <em><em>all year</em></em>.)
</p><p>
	Fossil fuels’ weight and energy density is ideal for flying. There is, right now, no drop-in replacement for jet fuel that is being produced at scale. So while we have some advice about how to mitigate your climate pollution from flying, it won’t make up a large part of this guide. Reduce the number of flights you take if you can, sure, and take more direct flights if possible. But the truth is that for now, there are smarter and more high-leverage decisions that you can make.
</p><p>
	Only decarbonization can get us closer to tackling climate change once and for all. Our belief at Heatmap is that if you care about climate change, then decarbonization — and not mere emissions reductions — should be your guiding star. If you want to follow that star, then read on.

## The Methodology Behind Decarbonize Your Life

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY1Njg4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTE1NDIxNH0.f2g56mu1YiaTzWPZLcEXce7t5gKc_GZpxaHKaoLi8IY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=262%2C0%2C138%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	There is no dearth of advice on the internet about how to lower your personal carbon emissions, but if we had found any of it completely satisfying, we wouldn’t have embarked on this project in the first place.
	<br/>
</p><p>
	Our goal with Decarbonize Your Life is to draw your attention to two things — the relative emissions benefits of different actions, as well as the relative structural benefits. (You’ll find everything you need to know about the project <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life" target="_blank">here</a>.) For the first, we needed some help. So we shared our vision with WattTime, a nonprofit that builds data-driven tools to help people, companies, and policymakers figure out how to reduce emissions, and lucky for us, they were excited to support the project.
</p><p>
	"So many people out there feel helpless when it comes to addressing the climate crisis, but we believe that anyone, anywhere should have the tools and information they need to make a difference,” Henry Richardson, a senior analyst at WattTime, told me as we were wrapping up this project. “So we love the idea of helping average consumers understand which actions actually available to them can meaningfully contribute to reducing climate pollution. We want to help people prioritize those higher-impact activities that can mitigate climate change faster."
</p><p>
	WattTime’s claim to fame is building an API that calculates the emissions impact of using the grid at a given time and place. Users can then shift their energy consumption to times when the grid is cleaner or to build renewables in places where they will reduce emissions the most.
</p><p>
	In an ideal world, we would have taken a similar time- and place-based approach in calculating the emissions savings of each energy-related action on our list. Switching to an EV if you live somewhere with very clean power will reduce emissions more than if you live somewhere with lots of coal plants, and likewise, getting rooftop solar if you live somewhere with coal-fired electricity is more effective than in areas with a cleaner grid. But when we started to game it out, we realized that level of 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exactitude</u></a> would be, if not exactly impossible, certainly insanity-inducing.

<div class="highlight-author">Robinson Meyer</div></div></div></div></div><p>
	Instead, WattTime helped us calculate the effect of each action if it was undertaken by an “average American household” — that is, one that consumes an 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=97&t=3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>average amount of electricity per year</u></a>, drives an <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>average number of miles</u></a> in an <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/average-fuel-efficiency-us-light-duty-vehicles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>average car</u></a> per year, uses an <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/c&e/pdf/ce3.1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>average amount of energy for space heating</u></a>, et cetera. WattTime also pulled data from publicly available sources like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Energy Information Administration, to estimate the baseline emissions and savings of a given action. We ultimately made two calculations for each action to account for two different ways of estimating the emissions from using the electric grid:
</p><ul>
<li>One that shows the emissions impact of using the electric grid today, based on WattTime’s data.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>One that shows the emissions impact of using the grid over the next several decades as it grows cleaner, based on <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cambium</u></a>, a dataset developed by the National Renewable Energy Lab.</li>
</ul><p>
	While the first method gives us a picture of how much good each action can do in an immediate sense, the second gives us a picture of how much good it can do over time. For example, using the first method, buying clean power came out on top, with rooftop solar offering the potential to cut CO2 by about 5.7 metric tons per year, while switching to an electric vehicle would cut about 3 metric tons per year. But using the second method, car-related actions won out, showing EVs cutting CO2 by 4.6 metric tons per year, and rooftop solar cutting 1.4 metric tons per year. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.
</p><p>
	To calculate the emissions savings from dietary changes and food waste management, we turned to two more partners: HowGood, a data platform for food system lifecycle analysis, and ReFED, which collects similar data for food waste. As with energy, we used federal data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to estimate the 
	<a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>average American diet</u></a> and ReFED’s estimates for the <a href="https://insights-engine.refed.org/impact-calculator?inputs=%7B%22sector%22%3Anull%2C%22type%22%3A%22standard-mix%22%2C%22unit%22%3A%22tons%22%2C%22alternative%22%3Afalse%2C%22destinations%22%3A%5B%5D%7D&year=100" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>average American food waste mix</u></a> (though note that those are for an individual, not for a household). From there, WattTime helped us determine that, for instance, just by replacing the beef in your diet with chicken, you could save nearly 2.5 metric tons of emissions each year — almost as much as you could save by going vegan.
</p><p>
	Because we used averages and sought to simplify our list with actions like “electrify your space heating system,” rather than estimating the impact of every permutation like “switch from a propane furnace in Colorado with X efficiency to a cold climate heat pump with Y efficiency,” our estimates of emissions reductions are rough approximations and not reflective of real-world scenarios.
</p><p>
	You’ll see that while these calculations certainly informed our ranking, they were not the sole metric we used to arrange this list. A quantitative analysis alone could not answer our question about the most “high-leverage” actions, so we used our reporting and expertise as climate journalists to fill in that last, crucial gap. Car-related actions and rooftop solar were neck-and-neck by the numbers, but we are confident that getting an EV (if you need to have a car) is more 
	<em><em>unambiguously</em></em> necessary for the energy transition than getting rooftop solar. Similarly, while eating less meat can hugely reduce the carbon tied to <em><em>an individual’s diet</em></em>, the ripple effect it has on agricultural carbon emissions is less direct and harder to parse than the effect you can have by electrifying all your appliances and shutting down your natural gas account.

## Why Switching to an EV Matters So Much for the Climate

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY1Mzg3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDI4MTg0OH0.gMxRiHit0D67RX8NiuxAG67LEpvzqRShxqC8Nro4MR0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=200%2C0%2C200%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Electric vehicles? <em><em>Really?</em></em>
</p><p>
	Is it <em><em>really</em></em> true that Heatmap looked at every way that you can decarbonize your life, meditated upon the politics, did the math, and concluded … that you should buy an EV? Are EVs really <em><em>that</em></em> important to fighting climate change?
</p><p>
	You’ll find more thorough answers to all those questions throughout Decarbonize Your Life, but the short answer is: Yes. If you really need a car, then switching from a gas car to an electric vehicle (or at least a plug-in hybrid) is the most important step you can take to combat climate change. And it’s not only good for your personal carbon footprint, it’s good for the entire energy system.
</p><p>
	Here is why we make that recommendation — and why you should trust us:
</p><h3>Electric vehicles produce significantly less climate pollution than internal combustion vehicles</h3><p>
	The best reason to use an electric vehicle is the most straightforward one: Driving an EV produces fewer greenhouse gases than driving a gasoline- or diesel-burning car. The Department of Energy <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimates</u></a> that the average EV operating in the U.S. produces 2,727 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution each year, while the average gasoline-burning car emits 12,594 pounds of carbon dioxide. Even a conventional hybrid vehicle — like a Toyota Prius — emits 6,800 pounds of CO2, or roughly 2.5 times as much as an EV.
</p><p>
	These gains hold almost regardless of how you analyze the question. Even in states where coal makes up a large share of the power grid — such as West Virginia, Wyoming, or Missouri — EVs produce half as much CO2 as gasoline vehicles, according to the DOE. That’s because EVs are <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/01/electric-vehicles-use-half-the-energy-of-gas-powered-vehicles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>much more energy efficiency</u></a> than internal combustion vehicles. So even though coal is a dirtier energy source than gasoline or diesel, EVs need to far less of it (in the form of electricity) to drive an additional mile.

<div class="highlight-author">Jeva Lange</div></div></div></div></div><p>
	EVs retain this carbon advantage even when you take into account their full “lifecycle” emissions — the cost of mining minerals, refining them, building a battery, and shipping a vehicle to its final destination. Across the full lifetime of a vehicle, EVs will release 57% to 68% less climate pollution than internal-combustion cars in the United States, according to <a href="https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Global-Vehicle-LCA-White-Paper-A4-revised-v2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a landmark analysis</u></a> from the International Council on Clean Transportation. (As the publication <em><em>Carbon Brief </em></em><a href="https://www.carbonabrief.org/factcheck-21-misleading-myths-about-electric-vehicles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has shown</u></a>, many analyses of EVs versus gas cars fail to take into account the full lifecycle emissions of the fossil-fuel system: the carbon pollution produced by extracting, refining, and transporting a gallon of gasoline.)
</p><h3>The carbon advantage of an EV improves the more you drive, and they are likely to improve over time</h3><p>
	Even if you only care about emissions math, two more important reasons justify switching to an EV.
</p><p>
	First, when you switch to an EV, you cut down enormously on the <em><em>marginal</em></em> environmental cost of driving an additional mile. Most of an EV’s environmental harm is “front-loaded” in its lifetime; that is, it is associated with the cost of producing and selling that vehicle. (Most electronics, including smartphones and laptops, have a similarly front-loaded carbon cost.)
</p><p>
	But the carbon emissions of driving an additional mile are relatively low. In other words, converting an additional kilowatt of electricity into a mile on the road is relatively benign for the climate.
</p><p>
	That’s not the case for an internal combustion vehicle. In a conventional gasoline- or diesel-powered car, every additional mile you drive requires you to burn more fossil fuels.
</p><p>
	Don’t overthink it: There is no way to <em><em>operate</em></em> a gasoline or diesel car without burning more fossil fuels. Conventional ICE cars are machines that turn fossil fuels into (1) miles on the road and (2) greenhouse gas pollution. This means that — importantly — using an internal combustion vehicle, or even a conventional hybrid vehicle, will never be climate-friendly.
</p><p>
	That’s why the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg3/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGIII_FullReport.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has concluded</u></a> that switching to an electrified transportation system — in other words, switching from gas cars to EVs — is “likely crucial” for cutting climate pollution and meeting the Paris Agreement goals. As the International Council on Clean Transportation <a href="https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Global-Vehicle-LCA-White-Paper-A4-revised-v2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>concluded</u></a> recently, “There is no realistic pathway for deep decarbonization of combustion engine vehicles.”
</p><p>
	This calculus is likely to improve over time. Over the past decade, the U.S. power grid’s climate pollution has plunged while emissions from the transportation sector have slightly risen; we anticipate that, over the next decade, the U.S. power grid’s greenhouse gas emissions are likely to decline at least moderately. Energy experts also expect more renewables to get built, and that natural gas will continue to drive coal off of the grid. These changes mean that the per-mile cost of driving an EV will likely fall. (If you’re in the market for an EV, Heatmap is <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/how-to-buy-an-ev" target="_blank">here to guide you</a>.)</p><h3>Switching to an EV helps ramp up an important supply chain</h3><p>
	When you switch to an EV, you do something else, too — something that may sound self-evident but is actually quite important: You increase demand for EVs and for the EV ecosystem.
</p><p>
	To be painfully direct about why this is important, this means that you stop spending so much money into the gasoline-powered driving system — the network of car dealers, gas stations, and oil companies that subsist on fossil fuels — and begin paying for products and services from the car dealerships, charging stations, and automakers who have invested in the new, low-carbon future.
</p><p>
	This is more important than it may seem at first. In the United States, automakers have struggled to ramp up their EV production in part because consumers haven’t been buying their EVs. EVs are a manufactured good, and the world is betting on their continued technological improvement. The more EVs get made at a company or industry level, the cheaper they should get.When you buy an EV, you prime the pump for further improvements in that manufacturing chain.
</p><h3>Your actions are unusually important because if anything is going to drive the EV transition in the United States, it’s most likely to be consumer demand.</h3><p>
	Under the Biden administration, the Environmental Protection Agency has adopted rules that could make EVs more than half of all new cars sold by 2032. But those rules are somewhat flexible — automakers could also meet them by selling a lot of conventional and plug-in hybrids — and they are under legal threat. If Donald Trump wins this year’s presidential election, then he will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-19/trump-vows-action-to-end-electric-vehicle-mandate-on-day-one" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>almost certainly roll them back</u></a>, much as he<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/02/an-inside-account-of-trumps-fuel-economy-debacle/606346/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> <u>reversed</u></a> the Obama administration’s less ambitious car rules. And even if Kamala Harris wins, then the zealously conservative Supreme Court could easily throw out the rules.
</p><p>
	Under most future scenarios, in other words, American consumers will have considerable power over how rapidly the country switches to electric vehicles. Even in a world where the federal government keeps subsidizing EV manufacturing and offers a $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers, the country’s transition to EVs will still depend on ordinary American families deciding to make a change and buy the cars.
</p><p>
	So if you want to decarbonize your life, switching to an EV — provided that you drive enough for it to make sense — is one of the most important steps that you can take.
</p><p>
	When you switch to an electric vehicle, you are doing several things. First, you are cutting off a source of demand for the oil industry. Second, you are creating a new source of demand for the EV industry. Third, you are generating new demand for the companies and infrastructure — such as charging stations — that will be needed for the entire transition.
</p><p>
	Buying an EV is a climate decision that makes sense if you want to cut your carbon footprint <em><em>and</em></em> if you want to change the American energy system. That’s why it’s Heatmap’s No. 1 recommendation for how to decarbonize your life.

## How to Shop for an EV

	Whatever your motivation for buying an electric vehicle, here’s the thing: The first day you own one, you’re going to love it.
	<br/>
</p><p>
	Forget the fears that come with a new technology, the negativity that stems from the politicization of EVs ownership, or the dead-and-buried stereotype that EVs are slow and boring rides for greenies only. Electric cars are zippy and fun because, unlike gas cars, they can produce a ton of torque from a resting stop. After a lifetime of listening to a car rattle and roar, I can say from experience that you’ll find driving in electric silence to be a revelation. An EV owner wakes up every morning with the equivalent of a full tank of gas because their home is their gas station.

<li>Enjoy the ride.</li>
</ul><h2>THE BASICS</h2><ul>
<li>When people say <em><em>electric vehicle</em></em><strong> </strong>these days, they mostly mean <strong>battery electric vehicle</strong>, the kind that runs on 100% electric power, like a Tesla. EVs have a giant lithium-ion battery, which is typically slung along the bottom of the car to give it a low center of gravity. An EV doesn’t need a lot of the parts required for internal combustion — look inside and you’ll find nary a spark plug, radiator, muffler, or timing belt.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>A <strong>plug-in hybrid electric vehicle</strong> appears to be an ordinary gasoline car under the hood. In the rear, however, and you’ll find a rechargeable battery that can also power the car. Because the plug-in hybrid has to fit its battery alongside all the typical combustion components, the battery is smaller than one in a fully battery-powered EV, allowing for just 30 to 40 miles of electric range, compared to 200 or 300-some miles for a true EV. That’s still enough for most people to complete their commute to work and back again without burning a drop of gasoline.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“That’s who the PHEV is for,” Moody told me. “You can do your errands around town with 30 to 40 miles, and when the battery runs out, you just keep driving.”</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>The <strong>hybrid electric vehicle</strong>, or just “hybrid,” has been commonplace on the road ever since the Toyota Prius went mainstream in the mid-aughts. A hybrid has both a gas engine and an electric motor, but you don’t plug it in — the gas engine recharges the battery as you drive. There are multiple ways to engineer a hybrid vehicle, called series hybrid and parallel hybrid, but all an everyday car shopper needs to know is that a hybrid decides when it’s most energy-efficient to run on electricity versus gas. By doing so, it delivers mileage an ordinary combustion car can’t match — 40, 50, or even more miles per gallon. </li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">What about fuel cells?</h4>
<p>
<strong></strong>Fuel-cell electric vehicles are powered by hydrogen that is stored in a tank under the car; the fuel cells use this hydrogen to generate electricity to propel the vehicle. There are a few hydrogen cars for sale, such as the Hyundai Nexo and Toyota Mirai. <strong>These are niche autos</strong>, though, because only a few places — California and the Northeast — have enough hydrogen refueling stations to support them.
		</p>
</div>
</div><ul>
<li>Buying an EV or PHEV also means you’re buying a battery. Battery life is described in <strong>kilowatt-hours</strong>, which is a measurement of how much energy the battery will hold — that is, for how many hours it could deliver power at the rate of 1,000 watts per hour. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>EV chargers are sometimes <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/rural/ev/toolkit/ev-basics/charging-speeds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>described</u></a> by how many kilowatts they put out, and therefore how fast they’ll fill your battery, typically expressed as <strong>Level 1, 2, or 3</strong>. (More on all things battery- and charging-related later.) The 120-volt outlet in your wall puts out just 1 kilowatt. The upgraded charger you’ll want to install in the garage puts out up to 19 kilowatts, while the fast chargers you’ll use on a trip down the interstate are rated up to 350 kilowatts. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Perhaps <em><em>the</em></em> defining stat about an EV (after its price) is its <strong>range</strong>, or the automaker’s estimate of how far the car can go on a single battery charge. Range is steadily growing as technology matures. Ten years ago, many EVs maxed out at 125-150 miles of range. Today’s typical EV makes in the mid-2000s, while some automakers allow you to get more than 300 miles by paying for a bigger battery pack.</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">A note on range</h4>
<p>
			Just because the car commercial says it will go 250 miles, don’t assume you’ll complete a 250-mile drive without stopping to charge. Why?
		</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll rarely charge to 100% — carmakers encourage you to quit at 80% or 90% to protect the battery’s health. </li>
<li>Charging speeds slow down significantly as you approach full. Going from 10% to 50% happens in a flash, but it feels like an eternity to get from 80% to 100%, even at the fast-charger. </li>
<li>You won’t want to let the battery get too low out of sheer range anxiety, which means the car is going to stay between 10% and 90% nearly all the time.</li>
<li> If you drive aggressively, or fly down the freeway at 80 miles per hour, or blast the AC to keep the cabin at 66 degrees Fahrenheit on a 99-degree summer day, then you won’t get nearly as many miles as the projection promises. </li>
<li>Just like your smartphone’s battery, your EV’s will fade little by little as the years go by, so that maximum range will wane.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Heatmap Recommends:</strong> If you’re buying an EV for the long haul, <strong>buy as much range as you can afford</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: line-through;">.</span>
</p>
</div>
</div><h2>
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
</h2><h4>
1. Will range anxiety ruin my life?
</h4><p>
	Ask nearly any EV expert and you’ll hear the same thing: “People don’t drive nearly as far as they think they do,” Moody said. Most of us put the vast majority of miles on our cars within a few dozen miles of our homes, running kids around town or driving to work. You’ll use up a small amount of your battery by the time you get home, plug in, and wake up the next day fully charged. Road trips may seem daunting to the uninitiated, but the interstates are now lined with fast-chargers and the number of them is growing quickly.
</p><h4>
2. Don’t EVs have environmental drawbacks, too?
</h4><p>
	Building an EV generates more carbon emissions than building a gas car, a difference that’s due to mining and creating materials for the battery. But that’s just manufacturing a vehicle; once it’s built, it has a decade or two of driving ahead of it. A combustion car constantly spews carbon as it burns fossil fuels, which dwarfs the amount it takes to make an EV. Don’t forget: An electric car gets greener as the grid gets greener. The more clean energy is added to the world’s electrical supply, the better EVs get in comparison to gas cars. You’d need to live in a state with an especially dirty energy grid, such as Wyoming or West Virginia, for an EV not to be a much better option than driving around on gasoline. Furthermore, McDonald said, you can forget the propaganda that suggests EV batteries wind up stacked in a landfill somewhere when the cars meet their end. A growing number of companies are ready to recycle EV batteries and retrieve the precious metals therein, while it’s likely that lots of batteries will find a second life in applications such as grid storage.
</p><h4>
3. Aren’t EVs expensive?
</h4><p>
	It’s true that price has long been one of the biggest barriers to EV adoption. Even though tax incentives — together with savings on fuel and maintenance — make many electrics cost-competitive with their gas counterparts in the long term, their high sticker price keeps many people away. But more electric models are beginning to creep down toward the cost of entry-level gasoline cars.
</p><h2>
BEFORE YOU GET STARTED
</h2><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<p>
<em>Purchase an EV from one of the new generation of electric-only car companies like Tesla, Lucid, or Rivian, and you might not have to visit the dealer at all — customize your vehicle online, and they’ll deliver it to you when it’s ready. That said, legacy automakers have finally started putting out compelling EVs, and for those you’ll have to make a trip to an old-fashioned lot.</em>
</p>
</div>
</div><p>
	As with buying an old-fashioned gas-guzzler, going to the dealership to get an EV means dealing with pushy salespeople, confusing specs, and haggling over the price. The process can be doubly frustrating for the EV shopper given the relative unavailability of some electric models and reports of some car salespeople who know frustratingly little about the very EVs they hock.
</p><p>
	If you live in a market where EVs have taken hold, like the San Francisco Bay Area, expect knowledgeable salespeople who can walk you through the EV buying process. If you live someplace where few electrics are sold, then the experience may be hit-or-miss. Do your own research, and prepare to be your own advocate.
</p><h4>1. Research tax incentives.</h4><p>
	For a long time, things were simple: If you bought an electric vehicle, then you could take a $7,500 credit on your taxes for that year. But things have gotten murkier in the past year or two — in a bid to protect domestic manufacturing, Congress passed new rules stating that a certain amount of the car and its components had to be made in the U.S. to qualify, leaving a confusing, shifting picture of which EVs qualify and which don’t. (To wit: Many Teslas 
	<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g43675128/cars-eligible-for-ev-tax-credit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>qualify</u></a>, Hyundais and Kias don’t, while Rivians receive only half the credit because they’re so expensive.) The upside of the changed rules is that buyers are now allowed to get tax credits on leasing an EV, or to receive the credit as an up-front discount on their new EV. Many states have generous incentives, too. Washington, for example, will give up to $9,000 in rebates for buying an EV. “There are enormous discounts on basically every EV on the market, even before we count the $7,500 with the federal tax credit,” Yoon told me.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<p>
<em>The elephant in the EV room is <strong>the 2024 election</strong>. President Joe Biden made support for EVs part of his core climate program, while Donald Trump has antagonized EVs to the point where many wonder whether, if elected, he would try to eliminate the subsidy. McDonald’s advice to the prospective buyer? 
			<strong>Don’t feel like you have to rush out and buy an electric vehicle before Inauguration Day</strong> — even if a new government wanted to repeal the tax credits, it would probably take a long, legislative slog.</em>
</p>
</div>
</div><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="assess">2. Assess your actual driving needs.</h4><p>
	Before you take the plunge, take a moment and really think about how you drive — because lots of people overestimate what they need. Maybe even keep notes and check your mileage every day for a week or two to find out how much you really use the car versus how much you think you do. If you find that you could get around town on a few dozen miles of charge but road trip every other weekend, then you might consider a plug-in hybrid. If you’ve already got a gas car or hybrid to handle longer trips and are shopping for a second vehicle, there’s no reason not to go for an EV, assuming you can afford one. If you just need basic transportation to take you a few miles to work, hate the idea of ever buying gas again, and want to spend as little as possible … maybe you should get an e-bike.
</p><h4>3. Decide whether to buy or lease.</h4><p>
	A refresher: When you buy a car, you typically put a downpayment on the vehicle, and then borrow enough money from the bank to pay off the rest of its price (plus interest and sales tax) in monthly payments over the course of four, five, or even more years. Leasing is like renting an apartment. You put down a deposit and then pay monthly over the course of the lease, typically three years. But like your rent, those payments don't go toward owning the car. At the end of the lease, you give it back. With EVs especially, there are some serious advantages and drawbacks to each approach you should keep in mind.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline"><strong>The Pros and Cons of Buying vs. Leasing</strong></h4>
<br/>
<ul>
<li><strong></strong><strong>Pros of Buying: </strong>You’ll actually own the car and aren’t just renting it; no mileage cap — drive it as far as you want; buy a used EV for cheap and still qualify for tax credits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cons of Buying</strong><strong>:</strong> You’ll want to keep the car for many years, which means being stuck with an aging battery and older tech.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros of Leasing: </strong>Keep up with changing technology, since you can easily swap vehicles every few years (“It's sort of like the early years of iPhones where you upgraded every two years,” said McDonald, a serial EV leaser); many more models are available for tax credits even if you lease; no worries about depreciation or aging.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cons of Leasing: </strong>No equity. Once the lease is up, you turn in the car and have to start a new lease; the monthly mileage limits are strict, and the penalties for exceeding them are high.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Heatmap Recommends: </strong>Because the EV market is moving so fast, with new vehicles and longer ranges arriving quickly, leasing may be the better deal.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="charging">4. Figure out where you’re going to charge.</h4><p>
	If you live in a century-old house that would need to have significant rewiring done to accommodate an EV charger, then installing a Level 2 charger might be too expensive, so you might want to stick to a plug-in hybrid. (Again, more on charging below.) Does your office have a charger? If you live in an apartment, does the parking lot have chargers?
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“How you refuel your EV is similar to how you charge your smartphone — you do it either throughout the day or at night before you go to bed. You plug in, you wake up, and it's full,” McDonald said.</strong></em></em>

</div><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="recommends">HEATMAP RECOMMENDS</h2><h4>
If you want to devote the least amount of time and energy to this decision as possible, get a Tesla Model Y.
</h4><p>
	“The first thing I tell people? You should probably get a Tesla,” Moody told me. Still, Elon Musk’s electric car company isn’t the darling it once was. Tesla has squandered a huge lead in the EV market by focusing on vanity projects like the Cybertruck and lost a chunk of public goodwill through Musk’s misadventures in politics and social media. But the company still has an ace up its sleeve with the Supercharger network, which is better and more reliable than the competition. This will change in the coming years, as the other automakers have adopted Tesla’s plug and their future cars will be able to use Superchargers. But for now, it’s a major advantage that makes owning a Tesla a lot less stressful than trying to get by with a competitor’s EV, especially if you make road trips. For this reason, Tesla’s Model Y — the best-selling car in the world in 2023, and the best-selling EV in America — remains a compelling choice for anyone who wants an EV to be their only car and have it go nearly anywhere.
</p><h4>
If you want to be able to haul around an entire youth soccer team, get a Kia EV9.
</h4><p>
	Don’t want Musk to get your money? Fret not. EV offerings from legacy car companies and new automakers are leaps and bounds better than they were five years ago when Tesla took over the industry. Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia, in particular, have outpaced other carmakers in offering fun and practical EVs. The new Kia EV9 is the best choice for buyers who want a true EV with three rows so they can accommodate six or seven passengers, and it’s a sleek-looking vehicle for its size. Its $57,000 starting price is not cheap, but it’s probably the best deal you can get for a true three-row electric vehicle right now.
</p><h4>
If you want an EV that screams, “I know how to have a good time,” get a Hyundai Ioniq 5.
</h4><p>
	The Ioniq 5 is a quirky mashup of a crossover and a hatchback. It’s got enough space to be practical as a family vehicle, but its dimensions aren’t quite like anything else on the market. In the EV-laden part of Los Angeles where I live, it’s the most common non-Tesla electric I come across.
</p><h4>
If you’re a prepper, get a Ford F-150 Lightning.
</h4><p>
	Introduced in 2021, the F-150 Lightning’s game-changing feature is two-way, or “bidirectional,” charging — you can plug into your house and use the energy stored in the truck’s battery to back up your home’s power supply in case of a blackout. Chevy is following suit by putting this tech into the Silverado EV. But even if you’re just driving and not powering your home, the Lightning is impressive — its standard battery produces 452 horsepower, but that number can climb to 580 on more expensive versions, and both offer a ton of torque.
</p><h4>
If you want the Range Rover look without the Range Rover emissions (and are okay with the Range Rover price), get a Rivian R1S.
</h4><p>
	Today’s Rivians are luxury lifestyle vehicles, but they offer a lot for all that cash. The R1 vehicles are spacious and well-appointed on the interior while offering lots of power and range for the off-road lifestyle the brand projects — the high-end version of the SUV gets 410 miles of range with 665 horsepower. Other excellent luxury EVs at the top end of the market include the 
	Lucid Air and Mercedes EQS, but the Air has the space limitations of a sedan (though it is a large one) and the Benz is likely to cost more than $100,000. Rivians are pricey, but they’re not 
	<em><em>that</em></em> pricey.
</p><h4>
If you need a car that can do it all for not much money, get a Hyundai Kona EV.
</h4><p>
	The people’s affordable EV champion, the Chevy Bolt, got the ax last year, but GM has promised to bring it back for people who want a smallish EV that doesn’t cost a fortune. In the meantime, the “SE” version of the Hyundai Kona EV, a small SUV, starts around $36,000 and gets 261 miles of range. (There’s an even cheaper version with 200 miles of range, but trust me: Don’t buy any new EV with less than 250 miles of range — e.g. the Nissan Leaf, Fiat 500, Mini Cooper, or Subaru Solterra — unless you really, 
	<em><em>really</em></em> like it.) Chevy finally electrified its huge-selling SUV and rolled out the Equinox EV; while it starts at $41,000 now, GM promises a $35,000 version soon to come.
</p><h4>
If you’re still working through your range anxiety, get a Prius Prime. 
</h4><p>
	There are a wide variety of PHEVs that are worth a look, but an especially compelling option is the Toyota Prius Prime. The entire Prius family of hybrids and plug-in hybrids just got a facelift for 2023 that is miles ahead of the frumpy, aging look the car previously had. And where the previous Prius Prime was limited to a puny 25 miles of electric range, today’s will do 44 — enough for lots of people to do their daily city driving without burning any gas.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Know your warranty</h4>
<p>
			An EV’s coverage is likely to be a little different than that standard car warranty you’re used to. A standard Tesla Model Y, for instance, comes with four-year, 50,000-mile basic coverage for most of the little things that could go wrong with your vehicle, but an eight-year, 100,000-mile warranty on the battery and drive unit that guarantees the battery won’t fade to less than 70% of its initial capacity during that time.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h2>
WHAT’S NEXT?
</h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="installed">1. Become a charging virtuoso.</h4><p>
	Some vocabulary to get you started:
</p><ul>
<li>A <strong>Level 1</strong> charger is your everyday household power outlet that provides 120 volts. Plug your car into the wall this way and you’ll get little more than a trickle, perhaps 3 or 4 miles of driving range per hour. This isn’t enough to charge your EV overnight (it might be enough for a PHEV, however), but it just might save your butt in a pinch — say if you’re camping in the boonies, use more electricity than you expected while you’re out there, and need just a few more miles to safely make it to the next high-speed charger. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Level 2</strong> is what most EV drivers use for the charger in their own garage. With the power stepped up to 240 volts, a Level 2 charger can add in the neighborhood of 25 to 30 miles of driving range per hour. That’s enough to take a typical electric vehicle from mostly empty to mostly full overnight — or during the course of a workday, if you’re lucky and your employer has plugs in the parking lot. If you’ve seen a charging station in front of your local Whole Foods or noticed a few EV charging spots in a parking garage, they’re likely Level 2 plugs. You’ll find them at some hotels, too, which is helpful since you can start the next day of your trip on full if you can snag a spot.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>If it’s fast enough to fill up your whole battery in an hour or less, it’s a <strong>Level 3</strong> charger, also known as a <strong>DC fast charger</strong>. Tesla’s Supercharger stations belong in this category, as do the fast-charging stations by companies like EVgo and Electrify America that service non-Teslas. EV owners who charge at home will visit Level 3 chargers only when they stray far from home on a road trip. Older Level 3 chargers from the 2010s topped out at 50 or 72 kilowatts, providing around 300 miles of range per hour. New stations, though, can deliver 250 or even 350 kilowatts, enough to take most EVs from 10% to 80% charge in just about 20 minutes. </li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">A note on etiquette</h4>
<p>
			If you’re staying at an AirBnb or guest house that doesn’t offer charging explicitly, you can still plug into any outdoor outlet for a top-up — just ask your host first, since they’re the ones who’ll be paying the bill.
		</p>
</div>
</div><p>
	Since charging at home is the make-or-break feature that will make your electrified life more convenient than your gas-burning days, your first order of business is getting a Level 2 charger installed. You’re going to need an electrician for this one, since it requires stepping up the voltage (and might require installing a new breaker panel or running new wiring, depending upon your home). Be sure to get multiple quotes so you can compare work estimates and prices.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“When you buy from an EV dealer or Tesla or whomever, they might refer you to an electrician or an installer. There are companies that have services and websites where they do all the work for you. You plug in your address and information, and they'll recommend and refer you to an installer,” McDonald said.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	How much this’ll cost you varies by where you live and how much work it’ll take to set up your home, but the national average is $1,200 to $1,500, McDonald says. The exception could be older houses that were not set up for anything close to the electrical load it takes to charge a car, so if you own a hundred-year-old home in New England with lots of original wiring, you might be in for a shock. Don’t forget, however, that lots of incentives are available for setting up EV infrastructure at your home. You might be eligible for a tax credit equal to 30 percent of the cost up to $1,000.
</p><p>
	As far as charging away from home? Most EVs automatically show nearby charging stations on their touchscreen navigation systems and will route you to the necessary stops along a long drive. Teslas will even show you how many stalls are available at a given Supercharger and how many other cars are en route. As an EV driver, you’ll get to know the fast-chargers in your neighborhood and along your familiar highways, but you’ll also get to know sites like Plugshare that will display every charger of every speed and every plug throughout that country — invaluable for planning a journey.
</p><p>
	As you get comfortable with your own driving habits, you’ll figure out whether you need to expand your choices by purchasing adapters or dongles that let your car charge at different kinds of plugs. For example, today’s non-Tesla EVs eventually will be able to charge at Tesla superchargers, but because they are still being built with the competing CCS standard, you’d need an adapter to allow today’s Ford Mustang Mach-E to use a Tesla plug. I have an adapter in my Tesla Model 3 to use the “J1772” plugs you find on the Level 2 charger at the grocery store, and I bought one for the NEMA 14-50 plugs common at an RV campsite — just in case I really get into trouble out there.
</p><h4>2. Embrace the zen of regenerative braking.</h4><p>
	When a car brakes to slow down, energy is lost. But in an EV, some of it can be recaptured via regenerative braking, a system that captures the energy from waste heat and puts it back into the battery. This allows for an experience unavailable to the gasoline motorist called 
	<strong>one-pedal driving</strong>: Take your foot off the accelerator and the car immediately slows itself down via the regenerative braking system. When I drive my Tesla Model 3, I only hit the brake pedal when I need to slow down in a big hurry; otherwise, I let off the accelerator and let the car coast to a stop. This system can add several miles of range back onto the battery if you’re coasting out of the mountains on a steep downgrade.
</p><p>
	A word of warning: Many people don’t like regenerative braking, at least at first, because it feels jerky to have the car instantly slow itself down when you let off the accelerator. But trust me, you’ll get better and better at letting off the pedal slowly so you don’t make your passengers nauseous. It’s also possible in many vehicles to turn down the regen so it’s less aggressive.
</p><h4>3. Revel in the many lifestyle benefits.</h4><p>
	For starters, think of all the car vocabulary you 
	<em><em>won’t</em></em> need anymore. An EV’s power output can be measured in torque and horsepower, but say goodbye to combustion-specific vernacular like spark plugs, cylinders, pistons, or liters as a measure of engine size (unless you get a plug-in hybrid). No more mufflers, no exhaust or timing belts. An EV has no use for miles per gallon, though carmakers and the EPA try to measure an electric car’s efficiency in miles per gallon equivalent as a way to compare them with gas cars.
</p><p>
	As the months and years go by, you’ll appreciate a number of differences in the EV owner’s lifestyle. Drivers needn’t bother with remembering the pesky oil change every 3,000 miles, nor with worrying about the lifespans of thousands of moving parts that come with internal combustion. (On the other hand, today’s EVs 
	<a href="https://www.autotrader.com/oversteer/tires-for-high-performance-evs-what-you-should-know" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>burn through tires</u></a> faster than gas cars do because of their weight and their performance.)
</p><p>
	There’s a lot more to learn, of course. Just remember: The first time you bypass the gas station — with its stinky fumes and pesky commercials screaming at you — to refuel your car in the comfort of your home, you’ll wonder why you waited so long.

## Why You Should Buy Clean Power — However You Can Get It

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY1MTA4MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0OTczMjk4Nn0.KxqFtyz8dsKfDUZ_XG_FHj4SncDkUTjz7VJ7pt5tpak/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=200%2C0%2C200%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Time is not our friend when it comes to climate change. The value of lowering greenhouse gas emissions today is greater than doing it in five years because every molecule of carbon we emit between now and then will accumulate in the atmosphere. You, as an individual, can’t make your utility build or buy more solar power more quickly. But you can start generating carbon-free kilowatts at home in a matter of weeks. (For more on that, check out our <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/reasons-to-get-rooftop-solar" target="_blank">guide to getting rooftop solar</a>.)</p><p>
	There is a heated debate among clean energy experts about the value of rooftop solar in the climate fight. Heatmap contributor and Princeton professor Jesse Jenkins <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-five-rooftop-solar" target="_self"><u>argues</u></a> that because big utility-scale solar installations are so much cheaper to build, rooftop solar rarely does little more than crowd out these projects, making our future clean energy system more expensive.
</p><p>
	But as <a href="https://cleankws.com/about-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Eric O’Shaughnessy</u></a>, a renewable energy market research analyst, told me, we don’t have a central planner who can wave a wand and manifest the most cost effective system. And in the real world, economics isn't the only factor determining what we build. Although the U.S. is now building more renewable energy than it has in the past, and the cost is <a href="https://www.lazard.com/media/5amjxc3g/lazards-lcoeplus-april-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>now on par with — if not lower than — new fossil fuel generation</u></a>, the clean energy industry is battling serious headwinds. A stubborn trifecta of inflation, supply chain constraints, and high interest rates has slowed utility-scale development compared to what it might have looked like. Community opposition to clean energy projects <a href="https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/opposition-renewable-energy-facilities-united-states-june-2024-edition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has increased</u></a> and will likely worsen as the least-controversial sites for development get used up. And we simply do not have enough power lines to accommodate new clean generation — solar and wind projects are <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/queues" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>waiting years to get approval</u></a> to connect to the transmission system.
</p><p>
	All of this is becoming a problem for our climate goals. A recent Rhodium Group <a href="https://www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org/reports/clean-electricity-and-transport-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a> found that the pace of clean energy deployment has lagged projections of what programs under the Inflation Reduction Act could be achieving — projections that already fall short of how much we <em><em>should</em></em> be building to meet our emissions targets. Though some of the challenges may ease — for example, the Federal Reserve just cut interest rates, which had become a <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-energy" target="_self"><u>significant obstacle</u></a> for clean energy deployment — others are likely to take longer to resolve.

	Homeowners, by contrast, can avoid land-use conflicts and act comparatively swiftly. “This is a space that's not being used,” O’Shaughnessy said. “Most people don't ever go to their roof. There’s no site acquisition. You don’t have to worry about an endangered turtle.”
</p><p>
	The immediate emissions benefits of installing solar really depend on where you live and how dirty your local grid is, among other factors. But the reason we still put rooftop solar in the number two slot is that it’s such a high leverage climate action in other ways. For example, having a solar array can help you afford future investments in other climate solutions like heat pumps and EVs, because it mitigates against electric bill increases. It can also reduce overall electricity demand in your neighborhood, which may help your utility avoid costly grid upgrades and keep rates lower in your area.
</p><p>
	If you pair your solar array with a battery, you may be able to join a utility program that synchronizes thousands of these systems in your region to decrease strain on the grid, avoid blackouts, and preempt the need to deploy fossil fueled “peaker” plants in periods of especially high demand. Various estimates from the <a href="https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/20230911-Pathways-to-Commercial-Liftoff-Virtual-Power-Plants_update.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department of Energy</u></a> and <a href="https://www.brattle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Real-Reliability-The-Value-of-Virtual-Power_5.3.2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>private research firms</u></a> have found that such “virtual power plants” have the potential to save billions of dollars over the next decade. These programs will typically pay you to participate, too.
</p><p>
	Researchers have also found that rooftop solar is “contagious” — one new installation in a neighborhood can cascade into several. “If you install solar, you are going to go through a process that most people have not,” O’Shaughnessy told me. “In doing that, you are going up this learning curve, and all of that is something that you can share with your friends, neighbors, family after the fact.”
</p><p>
	If you’re a renter, or if you aren’t able to get rooftop solar today for some other reason, subscribing to a community solar project is another way to help speed up solar deployment in your region and reap some of the benefits that homeowners have access to. Community solar arrays are usually small installations on warehouse roofs, parking lots, or beside highways. Subscribers sign up for a portion of the electricity produced, and receive credits on their electric bills the same way they would with a rooftop system. These projects aren’t available everywhere, though. Solar United Neighbors, who we consulted for our rooftop solar guide, has <a href="https://solarunitedneighbors.org/community-solar/how-community-solar-works/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more background reading</u></a> and a <a href="https://solarunitedneighbors.org/community-solar/directory/#projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>directory of projects you can subscribe to</u></a>.
</p><p>
	(A brief note on a third option: choosing a “green” retail electricity provider. This is a much more indirect way to support the energy transition, and experts are split on whether it’s worth doing at all. In theory, it sends a demand signal for renewables and helps new projects get built, but there’s no way to really know how far your money is going. Because the benefits are not guaranteed, we are not including this option in this package.)
</p><p>
	Getting rooftop solar can be a big, confusing project, and our guide on the subject will walk you through everything you need to know to feel prepared to tackle it.

## How to Put Solar Panels on Your Roof: A Step-by-Step Guide

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0MjE0My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NzM2MjU2MH0.yuVjHsLhEyaD_ccKFtDU7SGzFNSmWy22IwkKplCivPY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=373%2C0%2C27%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Rooftop solar is not like other types of consumer technology. Even though the end result is having a bunch of electrical equipment installed on the roof of your home, the process of getting solar is more like doing a bathroom renovation than buying a flat screen TV. To get the results you’re looking for, the most important decisions you’ll make are not the brand or model of the panels, but rather who you hire for the job, the size of your system, and how you finance it.
	<br/>
</p><p>
	There’s a bunch more choices you’ll have to navigate along the way, and it’s easy to get overwhelmed. One expert I spoke with told me that sometimes the customers who are the most excited about getting solar end up bailing, the victims of decision fatigue.
</p><p>
	We created this guide to save you from that fate. So take a deep breath, take my hand, and let’s walk down the metaphorical hardware store aisle and get you the rooftop solar solution you’re dreaming of.
</p><h2>THE EXPERT PANEL</h2><p>
<em><strong><em>Roger Horowitz</em></strong></em> is the director of Go Solar programs at Solar United Neighbors, a national nonprofit that serves as an unbiased resource for homeowners interested in solar. Horowitz manages and provides technical support to the company’s Solar Help Desk team.
</p><p>
<em><strong><em>Tony Vernetti </em></strong></em>is a senior trainer at Enphase Energy, a company that produces inverters, batteries, and EV chargers, where he trains solar sales and installation teams. Before joining Enphase in 2020, Vernetti spent 12 years working for rooftop solar companies in California.
</p><p>
<em><strong><em>Nate Bowie</em></strong></em><strong> </strong>is the vice president of residential sales at ReVision Energy, an employee-owned solar company operating throughout northern New England. Bowie has been selling solar for ReVision for 15 years.
</p><h2>OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS</h2><ul>
<li>Finding your <a href="#consumption">energy usage data</a> and consider your <a href="#lease">financing options</a>.</li>
<li>Reach out to solar companies for <a href="#quote">quotes</a>.</li>
<li>Review and compare quotes and refine your <a href="#size">system specifications</a>.</li>
<li>Secure financing and <a href="#contract">sign your contract</a>.</li>
<li>Wait for your installer to <a href="#contract">secure permitting and interconnection approvals</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#contract">Schedule installation</a>.</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">A note on timing</h4>
<p>
			While the actual installation of the system should only take 
			<strong>one to two days</strong>, the entire process from initial outreach to grid connection takes <strong>two to four months</strong> on average, according to Solar United Neighbors.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h2>
THE BASICS
</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Photovoltaic panels </strong>convert sunlight into electricity. They come in different sizes and levels of efficiency.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Solar panel size is expressed in <strong>watts</strong>, which is a measure of how much power each panel can generate in direct sunlight. The system size is expressed in <strong>kilowatts</strong>. (1 kw = 1,000 watts.)</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<p>
<strong>Example: </strong>The <a href="https://www.energysage.com/solar/best-solar-panels-complete-ranking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">highest rated solar panels</a> for 2024 according to EnergySage.com are SunPower's M-Series <strong>440 watt</strong> model. If you install 20 of these, the system will be capable of generating <strong>8,800 watts</strong>, or <strong>8.8 kilowatts</strong> in direct sun.
		</p>
</div>
</div><ul>
<li>When you receive a quote, you will also see an estimate for how much power the system is expected to produce over the course of a year. This will be expressed in <strong>kilowatt hours. </strong>(1 kilowatt hour means your panel has generated 1 kilowatt for 1 hour.)</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Inverters</strong> are a key component of the system that convert the electricity the solar panels generate from direct current (DC power) to alternating current (AC power), which is the kind you use in your home. They are often called the “brain of the system” because they also collect data on system performance and send it to your <strong>monitoring system</strong>, an app you can use to track your energy production and system status.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>A <strong>battery</strong>, or <strong>energy storage system</strong>, is an optional component that can store the electricity your solar panels generate and dispatch it later. You can have rooftop solar with or without a battery, but your solar panels will not provide backup power during a blackout unless you have a battery. Most people get batteries for resilience during an outage, but in some regions with favorable policies, batteries can provide additional financial savings.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Net </strong><strong>metering</strong> is a policy that allows homeowners to sell excess power that their solar panels generate to their utility. The rate at which homeowners are compensated varies in every state, and can determine whether it is worth it to invest in solar, and how quickly the payback period is.</li>
</ul><h2>
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. Is solar energy free?</h4><p>
	When you start searching for information about solar on the internet, you might come across advertisements or commercials promoting free solar panels. There is no such thing. These ads are typically schemes to collect your personal data and sell it to solar companies looking for leads, and the federal government is starting to 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/solar-scams" target="_self"><u>crack down on them</u></a>. <br/>
<br/>
	It is possible to install solar with zero up-front costs if you lease the system or take out a loan to finance it, but in both cases you will still owe monthly payments. It is also rare that anyone is able to offset 100% of their utility bill. You can get close, but you will likely still owe at least a connection fee to your utility company.
</p><h4>2. I don’t live in the sun belt and my roof doesn’t face south. Is solar still worth it?</h4><p>
	Most homeowners in the U.S. can benefit from installing solar as long as local energy policies are favorable. Placing the panels on a south-facing roof is optimal, but not necessary. If your panels face due west, you’ll only lose about 10% of potential generation, according to Vernetti. “They still produce a ton of energy. They’re still very effective. It's just a little bit less than if they're facing south,” he said. An east-facing roof is also viable in most cases.
</p><h4>3. Does having rooftop solar require me to do anything?</h4><p>
	You don’t have to worry about shoveling snow off the roof or anything like that. But like any other electronic devices, solar panels, inverters, and batteries can break or malfunction, and your system may require servicing at some point. Pay close attention to your warranties (more on that later). If you lease the system, you do not have to worry about this as much because the third-party owner will be responsible for maintenance.
</p><h2>
BEFORE YOU GET STARTED
</h2><h4 id="consumption">1. Know your energy consumption history</h4><p>
	In order to design a system that meets your needs and budget, solar companies will ask for a copy of your most recent electricity bill or, ideally, your annual energy consumption history. Make sure you have this information handy before you reach out for quotes.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Where do I find my energy consumption history?</h4>
<p>
			Some utilities include your annual energy consumption, broken out by month, at the bottom of your electric bill. If you don’t see it, you should be able to log into your utility account online and download either your statements from the past year or a spreadsheet of your monthly electric meter readings.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="lease">2. Consider leasing versus owning</h4><p>
	In most of the U.S., you will find you have the option either to lease your solar panels or buy them outright. You don’t have to decide which way you want to go before you get started, but it’s helpful to think through the pros and cons of each.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline"><strong>Pros and Cons of Leasing vs. Buying</strong></h4>
<br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros of Leasing:</strong> Typically zero up-front cost; you don’t have to worry about maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cons of Leasing:</strong> You won’t save as much money on your monthly energy bills; it can complicate the process of selling your house, as you may have to pay out the rest of your lease at once or find a buyer who is willing to take it over.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Heatmap Recommends</strong> leasing if: You’re fairly certain you’ll keep your house for the next 15 to 20 years; you can’t afford the system outright, but you don’t want to take out a loan; your priority is to generate clean energy and reduce emissions, but you don’t want to spend too much time figuring out what you want or worrying about the system’s maintenance.
		</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros of Buying:</strong> You will benefit from the full savings the system generates each month; you can take advantage of tax credits and rebates to help with the up-front cost; it increases your home’s value.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cons of Buying:</strong> Can cost tens of thousands of dollars; high interest rates (as of 2024) make loans less attractive; you may be responsible for paying for any maintenance or repairs depending on your warranties.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Heatmap Recommends</strong> buying if: You have the cash in hand; you might sell your house in the next 20 years; you know you want to have control over the details of your project.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4>3. Learn about incentives</h4><p>
	The federal government offers a 30% tax credit for solar installations (and batteries) that covers parts and labor. It can significantly reduce the cost of getting solar, even if you don’t have a lot of tax liability in the year that you install the system. The credit will roll over to subsequent tax years.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<p>
<strong>Example: </strong>If you spend $25,000 installing solar in 2024, you’ll be eligible to take $7,500 off your federal income tax bill. If you only owe $3,000 in federal taxes in 2024, you’ll get $3,000 back and will be eligible to claim the remaining $4,500 for the 2025 tax year. If in 2025 you only owe $3,000 again, you can claim the remaining $1,500 in 2026.
		</p>
</div>
</div><p>
	Additional tax credits and rebates may also be offered by your state energy office, city, or utility. Contractors should be able to help you figure out what you’re eligible for, and you can wait to talk to them to learn more. However, incentives change frequently, and contractors don’t always keep up, so you might want to review the options in your area independently.
</p><p>
	It will also be helpful to understand your state’s 
	<strong>net metering</strong> policy, as that will determine how quickly your investment in solar will pay off and may also dictate how big your system can be. Some states, like New Jersey, also allow homeowners to generate additional income through the sale of <strong>solar renewable energy credits</strong>, or <strong>SRECS.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Where to look for more information: </strong>
</p><ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.dsireusa.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency</u></a> is a great place to start, although it may not list county- or city-specific subsidies. Enter your zip code and filter the results by “Eligible Sector > Residential.” </li>
<li>Check with your state energy office or local sustainability office. They may have a helpline, or have information about upcoming webinars or in-person educational events.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.solarunitedneighbors.org/go-solar/want-to-install-solar/go-solar-on-your-own/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Solar United Neighbors Help Desk</u></a> can also help you find and understand local incentives.</li>
</ul><h4>4. Find out how old your roof is</h4><p>
	One of the worst things that could happen is you install rooftop solar panels, and then later find out you have a leak or some other problem with your roof. “Removal and replacement of an array for a reroof is expensive and could significantly impact the owner’s return on investment,” Bowie told me. While metal roofs last a very long time and are unlikely to need a replacement, asphalt shingle roofs generally have a useful life of 25 to 30 years, Bowie said. You should be fine if your roof is less than 10 years old, but if not, you may need some roofing work done before your solar panels are installed.
</p><p>
	If you don’t know how old your roof is, Vernetti recommended having a roofing contractor inspect it. He added that there’s varying opinions on this, with some solar experts recommending replacement if the roof is only 5 years old. “In my opinion, scrapping a 5 year old roof is wasteful and goes against the goal of sustainability,” he said.
</p><p>
	“A good solar contractor will help evaluate the roof conditions and should recommend replacement when necessary, even if it is just to replace the roof on the roof plane where the solar panels will go,” said Bowie.

FINDING A CONTRACTOR
</h3><p>
	Solar contractors range from local mom and pop shops, to regional providers like ReVision Solar, which operates in multiple states in the Northeast, to national companies that install across the country like SunRun and Sunnova.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“The advantage of going with a large company is that they have the ability to offer financing the smaller companies might not be able to. With a regional company, you can actually walk to their office and knock on the door and talk to somebody if you want to,” said Vernetti.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><p>
<strong>Heatmap Recommends: </strong>Contact at least one local company and one national company to get a good sense of your options. Always get <u><em><em>at least three</em></em></u> quotes!

Here are a few strategies for finding solar contractors, in order of what we recommend:
</h4><ul>
<li>Talk to your friends, family, and neighbors that have solar. Were they happy with their experience? Which companies did they talk to? Who did they decide to work with and why?<br/>
</li>
<li>Check if your state energy office or utility has an online directory of local solar installers. If your town or city has a sustainability office, try that, too.</li>
<li>Try using <a href="http://energysage.com" target="_blank"><u>EnergySage</u></a>, which will have you enter your address and monthly energy usage and then source quotes for you from installers that serve your area. (Note: Treat these quotes as a starting place, as the companies may not have all of the information they need to make fully informed estimates.)<br/>
</li>
<li>Some solar manufacturers, including <a href="https://www.tesla.com/solarpanels" target="_blank"><u>Tesla</u></a> and <a href="https://www.recgroup.com/en-us/search-installers" target="_blank"><u>REC</u></a>, have their own certified networks of installers. You can get a quote and get connected to local installers directly through their websites.</li>
</ul><h4>
What to look for when you reach out for quotes:
</h4><p>
	If you are calling installers directly, here are some tips for what you should ask for or look for in a quote. (If you are using an online resource like EnergySage that finds quotes for you, use the following to help you ask follow-up questions or refine the proposals.)
</p><h4>1. Vet the company</h4><p>
	A few questions you should ask:
	<br/>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>How long have you been in business? </strong>Solar is a tough business, and many companies go under within a few years. You want to make sure your installer has proven longevity so that they can help you in the future if any issues arise.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Are your employees certified with the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners?</strong> NABCEP is an accreditation organization for renewable energy professionals. It costs money for individuals and companies to get certified, and it shouldn’t necessarily be a dealbreaker if your installer is not certified. However, those certified by NABCEP must meet minimum professional experience and training requirements, so it’s a helpful data point.</li>
</ul><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="size">2. Know what size system you want</h4><p>
	One of the first questions an installer might ask you is how big you want the system to be. You may want to see quotes for multiple options in order to compare them. Options include:
</p><ul>
<li>Matching the system to your average annual energy use</li>
<li>Oversizing the system to generate more power than you typically use in a year</li>
<li>Undersizing the system to generate less power than you use in a year</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<p>
<strong>Heatmap Recommends</strong>: Oversize your system if you can afford it.
		</p>
<p>
<strong>Why?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Many homeowners find that once they get solar panels, they start to use more energy, Vernetti said. Because it lowers your electricity bills, you might be more inclined to crank the A/C or keep the lights on. An oversized system will protect against that risk and lead to more savings.</li>
<li>If you’re reading this guide, you’re probably interested in other home decarbonization technologies like electric heat pumps or electric vehicles, both of which will increase your future electricity use. Think about what other electric appliances you might invest in over the next decade or so and size your system to meet that need. (If you have a big roof, expanding your system later may also be an option.)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Exceptions:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some utilities will not allow you to oversize your system. (Your installer should know if that will be an issue for you.)</li>
<li>Oversizing is more expensive. If you can’t afford it right now, you can always add more panels to your system later as long as you have more roof space.</li>
<li>Undersizing the system may make financial sense in some states depending on residential solar policy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><h4>3. Understand your financing options</h4><p>
	Most installers will include a financing option in their quote. Horowitz noted that some installers advertise very low interest rates that are below market rate. They are typically able to do this by paying a “dealer fee” to the bank, which they incorporate into the price of your installation — in other words, if your interest rate seems too good to be true, the total cost of your installation will likely be higher than it otherwise would be. To get a better sense of the true cost, ask for quotes both with and without financing options.
</p><h4>4. Consider a battery</h4><p>
	Adding energy storage, a.k.a. a battery, to your solar array can add another 10 grand or more to the project cost. But there are a few reasons it might be worth it:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>You want backup power during a blackout. </strong><br/>
	As I mentioned earlier, solar panels alone won’t power your house when the grid is down. But if you have a battery, you can store the energy they generate and use it to power essential systems like your refrigerator and air conditioner during an outage. Note that you will not save additional money with a battery, unless…
	</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Your utility offers time-of-use rates</strong><strong><br/>
</strong>If what you pay for electricity varies throughout the day or your utility offers an option to switch to this kind of pricing scheme, then a battery will enable you to arbitrage prices by tapping into your stash of electrons when prices hit their peak. Ask your contractor if they can help set the battery to maximize your bill savings. Aligning with time-of-use pricing doesn’t necessarily maximize your <em><em>carbon</em></em> savings, however. For that, look into…</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Grid services or virtual power plant programs</strong><strong><br/>
</strong>In some jurisdictions, you can sign up to give your utility or a third party the ability to take control of your battery and charge it or discharge it strategically to help the electric grid. For example, when demand is expected to peak on a hot summer day, these programs might discharge thousands of residential batteries in order to prevent the utility from having to deploy dirty (and expensive) “peaker” plants, which are usually powered by natural gas or oil. These programs offer either up-front rebates for batteries or will pay you for your participation, or both. The key thing is you have to buy a battery that’s compatible with the program.</li>
</ul><p>
	In conclusion, if you just want back-up power, any battery that’s large enough to power your essential systems should do. If you want to pay off the investment, look into time-of-use rates. If you want your investment to go further for decarbonization, ask your contractor if there are local grid services programs available, and if any of their products are compatible.
</p><h3>
YOU HAVE THREE QUOTES. NOW WHAT?
</h3><p>
	After you get a few quotes, you’re going to want to spend some time comparing them, asking questions, and potentially soliciting additional quotes with variations on the system. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or you don’t have the time or patience to sort through the details on your own, you can also call the Solar United Neighbors Help Desk, which offers a free quote review service.
</p><h4>1. Compare the price per watt</h4><p>
<strong>The most important number on the quote is the price per watt</strong>, not the total system cost. That is the number you should be comparing between different installers, as the quotes may be for differently sized systems.
</p><p>
	You should also 
	<strong>compare the annual bill savings.</strong> If two different companies quote you significantly different savings for systems that are roughly the same size, one of them has likely done a more detailed analysis of your roof than the other.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“It doesn't matter what module you have, from which manufacturer, or what inverter you have. There really is no difference in what your system can produce if it's the same size,” said Bowie.</strong> </em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	Lastly, if the quote is for a solar lease, or includes a financing option, 
	<strong>look at the</strong> <strong>monthly payments.</strong>
</p><h4>2. Compare the equipment</h4><p>
	Every installer has certain brands and types of equipment they work with. Our expert panel agreed that it’s important to look at the brand names the installer is offering for the solar panels, inverters, and batteries, and to make sure they are from reputable companies that have been around for at least five years — even if it means paying more. A quick internet search of the top 10 residential solar panel brands should give you 
	<a href="https://www.energysage.com/solar/best-solar-panels-complete-ranking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a taste of what those companies are</u></a>.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em>“It is definitely worth paying a little bit extra to have really good equipment,” Vernetti said.</em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	You may also see installers advertise that they offer “Tier 1” solar panels. That means the manufacturer has been 
	<a href="https://assets.bnef.com/public/tiering/solarmodules.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>designated “bankable” by Bloomberg New Energy Finance</u></a>. The designation is more related to finance than product quality, but many solar companies use it as a rough proxy for reliability.
</p><p>
	That being said, don’t get too bogged down in comparing solar brands.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“There's not a huge difference, typically, between one solar panel and the next of the Tier 1 manufacturers,” said Bowie. “A lot of solar companies will maybe offer one or two different manufacturers, and then maybe beyond that one or two different sizes.”</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	When it comes to inverters, you do want to pay attention to whether your quote includes string inverters, microinverters, or power optimizers. In a system with a 
	<strong>string inverter</strong>, your panels will all be wired to one central inverter. This is generally the cheapest option, but it is less durable and may need to be replaced, said Vernetti, whose employer, Enphase, is the leading producer of microinverters. String inverters can also limit the output of your system if part of the roof gets more shade.
</p><p>
	The other two options are more expensive but get around the issue with shade. A system with 
	<strong>power optimizers </strong>is similar to one with a string inverter, but each panel will also have a small device attached to it that regulates the output and maximizes your system’s performance. By contrast, <strong>microinverters</strong> are small inverters attached to each individual panel. Both of these options also allow you to monitor each panel’s performance.
</p><p>
	Bowie said the two were comparable in terms of performance and price. A key consideration, he said, is that your choice of inverter can begin to lock you into using the same brand of equipment on other home upgrades you might do down the line. “If you're an EnPhase customer, you're likely going to be going down the track of an EnPhase battery storage system,” he said. “Whether the customers know it or not, they're kind of being pushed down a path towards this manufacturer for more things in their home, like batteries, whole home controls, electric vehicle charging."
</p><h4>3. Pay close attention to the warranties</h4><p>
	Your quote should provide information about warranties offered by the manufacturers of the panels, inverters, and batteries, as well as by the installation company. 25-year warranties are standard, but the details vary by installation company and by manufacturer. For example, your inverters may have a 25-year warranty, meaning you can get replacement inverters for free if any of them fails within that time period — but if you don’t have a warranty on labor, it could cost you several hundred dollars to get them installed.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“It's really important for customers to read the fine print and to talk with their local solar company who is quoting the system for them to uncover what the warranties mean,” said Bowie.</strong> </em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	This is especially important if you are installing batteries. Ask your installer about both the equipment warranty and their policy is for servicing the equipment.
</p><h4>4. Look into other financing options</h4><p>
	Most solar installers offer financing options. Your quote should include the name of the lender the installer works with, the down payment, monthly payment, financing term, and interest rate. However, you may find a better deal elsewhere. Horowitz noted that installers like using their own financing companies because it speeds up the sales process — they can approve you for a loan just by putting in your social security number, and sell it to you at the same time as the contract. But you may find a better deal elsewhere.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“Talk to your bank, talk to your credit union, look at home equity lines of credit, see what other options you have out there, and if those have lower interest rates or better payment terms,” said Horowitz. “You are not required to use their finance.”</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="contract">
WHAT’S NEXT?
</h2><p>
	After you’ve found an installer, settled on a system design, and secured financing, all that’s left to do is sign your contract. Then, you wait. Your installer will have to obtain permits from your city, county, or state, as well as an interconnection agreement with your utility.
</p><p>
	One way to try to minimize the wait time is by working with an installer with lots of local experience. They’ll be better equipped to navigate the permitting process. For example, if you want Tesla solar panels but Tesla hasn’t done many installations in your community, it may take longer for the company to get through this stage.
</p><p>
	After these two steps are complete, the solar company will reach out to you to schedule the installation, which should only take a few days.
</p><p>
	After the system is installed, you may have to wait for a final inspection from your utility or a verified third party for permission to operate the system.

## Why Energy Efficiency Begins at Home

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NDg5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTE1OTIwM30.Yc7LYvQl4TT_rLeuTbmBUZO6L7cQx3YT5QjVikwQvu8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=200%2C0%2C200%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	An energy-efficient home needs energy-efficient lightbulbs and air conditioners and refrigerators and other gadgets to fill it up. But it all starts with the structure itself. That’s why we recommend you take a good, hard look at your walls, ceiling, floors, windows, doors, roof, and electrical wiring as a first step towards decarbonizing your home life. (Embarking on a renovation? Heatmap has a <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/energy-efficient-renovation" target="_blank">guide</a> for that.)</p><p>
	When you add air sealing and insulation, get energy efficient windows, or a cool roof that reflects heat back into the environment, you’re either preventing heat from entering or escaping. This stabilizes your indoor air temperature, thereby reducing your heating and cooling loads, which <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/c&e/pdf/ce3.1.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>account for 55%</u></a> of a household’s total energy use, on average. Making these improvements is not only good for the environment, it’s also a boon to your quality of life. Plus, it allows you to get the most bang out of one of Heatmap’s other favorite decarbonization upgrades: <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/how-to-get-a-heat-pump" target="_blank">replacing your furnace with an electric heat pump</a>, which operates most efficiently in a well-insulated home.
</p><p>
	And lest we forget the electrification upgrades, they’re certainly a different beast than the aforementioned ways to seal up your house. But adding new electrical circuits is a prerequisite to installing energy-efficient appliances such as electric stoves, dryers, heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, or EV chargers. And depending how much space is on your electric panel, you might need to upgrade that too.
</p><p>
	None of the investments mentioned here (often referred to as weatherization upgrades) will directly decarbonize your space. Insulating your attic won’t free you from fossil fuels, and installing new wiring doesn’t actually electrify anything in and of itself, although they will lower your energy-related emissions. But what these renovations <em><em>do </em></em>do is prime you to consume less energy at home just keeping yourself comfortable.
</p><p>
	“The weather that you can expect to see where you live is changing over time and changing in a pretty unpredictable manner,” Michael Gartman, a manager at RMI on their carbon-free buildings team, told me. “The benefit of weatherization, unlike some of the other decarbonization measures that you might be thinking about, is it really just shelters you from whatever that change means over time.”

<div class="highlight-author">Emily Pontecorvo</div></div></div></div></div><p>
	None of this sounds very thrilling, I know. These types of upgrades certainly won’t lead to the same oohs and ahhs that you’d get for buying a shiny new electric vehicle or induction stove. “You often can't see weatherization after it's been completed, and even if you can, I don't think many people are going to be taking guests into their basement and pointing at their floor joists and saying, <em><em>look at all that insulation</em></em>,” Gartman told me.
</p><p>
	Probably not, but once folks spend some time inside your house, the benefits will become apparent in cooler summer days and cozier winter nights — and lower energy bills. “Even if it’s not sexy, that's something that you're going to feel every year that you're in your home,” Gartman said.
</p><p>
	These upgrades that you’re considering — and the attendant reductions in energy use — will have impacts that ripple out beyond your home’s walls and onto the grid at large. After all, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/us-residential-building-stock-decarbonization-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>residential energy consumption makes up</u></a> 21% of total energy use in the U.S., and 15% of total emissions.
</p><p>
	“Weatherization can reduce peak demand on the grid, which reduces the likelihood of the grid going down in the coldest winter nights or hottest summer days,” Gartman told me. This makes the grid greener, too, as utilities often meet demand spikes by calling on fossil fuel sources such as gas plants, which can ramp up and down quickly. A smoother demand curve can thereby increase the share of renewables in the mix. And in the case that the grid does fail and the power goes out, a fully weatherized home is a safer home, protecting you and your family from the elements for as long as possible.
</p><p>
	Depending on what weatherization measures you go with, as well as your specific circumstances, your savings could eventually surpass your upfront costs. The upgrade that’s most likely to pay for itself is air sealing and insulation, which can lead to <a href="https://rpsc.energy.gov/energy-data-facts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>energy bills that are 10% to 20%</u></a> smaller, leading to net savings in <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/adding-insulation-existing-home#:~:text=Many%20older%20homes%20have%20less,home%20and%20where%20it%20is." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just a few years</u></a>. The <a href="https://gba.org/resources/green-building-methods/exterior-solutions/cool-roofs/#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Cool%20Roofs,Lower%20Temperatures" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Green Building Alliance says</u></a> cool roofs — which are not suited to every environment — can also pay for themselves in as little as six years. And while complete window replacements are a particularly pricey upgrade, if you opt for storm windows that are installed on top of an existing window, you could see <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/energy_star_home_upgrade/windows_and_storm_windows#:~:text=A%20More%20Affordable%20Option%20%2D%20Storm%20Windows" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>payback as soon as three years time</u></a> post-installation.
</p><p>
	No matter what you choose to do, the absolute best time to do it is when prices are low — and when it comes to energy efficiency upgrades, the discounts have arrived. “A lot of energy performance improvements to houses right now are on sale, and they're going to be on sale until the end of the decade,” Eric Werling, former national director of the Department of Energy’s Zero Energy Ready Homes program, told me. He’s referencing the <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/federal-incentives/25c-weatherization-tax-credits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1,200 federal tax credit for weatherization</u></a>, which is available now, and the <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/federal-incentives/home-efficiency-rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>home efficiency</u></a> and <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/federal-incentives/home-electrification-appliance-rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electrification</u></a> rebates that will be rolling out this year and next.
</p><p>
	But even with this years-long sale, we know that the upfront costs can be tough to shoulder. So don’t feel pressure to drop thousands in the name of decarbonization <em><em>right now</em></em>. If you stay in your spot long enough, you’ll eventually need to undertake at least a few home improvement projects. “Anytime anybody does a renovation project or fixes a problem in the house,” Werling told me, “I implore them to think about, is there an opportunity for me to make improvements to the house that will pay for themselves in utility cost savings, but also improve the health and safety and comfort of the house that we live in?”
</p><p>
	You’ll find the answer is often yes, and we encourage you to let your friends, family, and neighbors know about it. Because while we trust that you, as a reader, care deeply about the climate, you don’t actually need to give a hoot to benefit from energy efficiency upgrades. As Werling put it, “It's just not about energy, and it's just not about the climate. It's about your home.”

## How to Renovate Your Home to Be Energy Efficient

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NDg4OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MDUyNDk2OH0.hrCoI9TVpOBXVb4fOGMDiWT82LzktrJ0cdiOgpnQ4q8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=72%2C0%2C328%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	When you think about ways to decarbonize, your mind will likely go straight to shiny new machines — an electric vehicle, solar panels, or an induction stove, perhaps. But let’s not forget the low-tech, low-hanging fruit: your home itself.
	<br/>
</p><p>
	Adding insulation, fixing any gaps, cracks or leaks where air can get out, and perhaps installing energy efficient windows and doors are the necessary first steps to decarbonizing at home — though you may also want to consider a light-colored “cool roof,” which reflects sunlight to keep the home comfortable, and electric panel and wiring upgrades to support broader electrification efforts.
</p><p>
	Getting started on one or multiple of these retrofits can be daunting — there’s lingo to be learned, audits to be performed, and various incentives to navigate. Luckily, Heatmap is here to help.
</p><h2>THE EXPERT PANEL</h2><p>
<em><strong><em>Cora Wyent </em></strong></em>is the Director of Research at Rewiring America, where she conducts research and analysis on how to rapidly electrify the entire economy.
</p><p>
<em><strong><em>Joseph Lstiburek </em></strong></em>is the founding principal at the Building Science Corporation, a consulting firm focused on designing and constructing energy efficient, durable, and economic buildings. <em><strong> </strong></em>
</p><p>
<em><strong><em>Lucy de Barbaro</em></strong></em> is the founder and director of Energy Efficiency Empowerment, a Pittsburgh-based organization that seeks to transform the home renovation process and help low and middle-income homeowners make energy efficiency improvements.
</p><h2>OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS</h2><ul>
<li>Do a <a href="#audit">home energy efficiency audit</a> and familiarize yourself with federal, state, and local <a href="#incentives">incentives</a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>Think through your <a href="#goals">overall goals</a> to create your retrofitting game plan.</li>
<li><a href="#contractor">Reach out to contractors</a> for quotes and compare.</li>
<li>Sign your <a href="#contract">contract</a> and schedule renovation.</li>
<li>Claim your <a href="#credits">tax credits</a> for the year in which the work was completed</li>
</ul><h2>THE BASICS </h2><ul>
<li>The whole process you’re about to embark on is known as <strong>weatherization</strong> or <strong>weatherproofing</strong>. Essentially what you’re doing is sealing off your home, so that whatever’s going on outside has little to no effect on the conditions inside. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>When contractors refer to your <strong>home envelope</strong>, they’re talking about anything related to your home’s exterior, including the roof, walls, floors, windows, and doors. You may hear many energy efficiency upgrades referred to as “home envelope upgrades,” as well. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>U-Value</strong> or <strong>U-Factor</strong> is a measurement of how well a window, door, or skylight insulates. The lower the U-Value, the better insulating these products are. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>How much heat passes through a window, door, or skylight and into the home is quantified as the <strong>solar heat gain coefficient, or SHGC</strong>, on a scale of zero to one. Lower SHGC values are better for hot climates and higher values are better for cold climates<strong>. </strong></li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The higher the <strong>R-value</strong> of a particular insulation material, the more effective it is. What R-Value you go with will depend on the climate you live in, what part of the house you are insulating, and whether any insulation already exists. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Dense packing </strong>is an insulation method also known as “drill and fill,” which refers to blowing loose fiber insulation into a wall at high pressure. For homes that are already built, many experts recommend using<strong> dense pack cellulose</strong> insulation, as it’s cheap, effective, and environmentally friendly. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Roofs covered in light-colored roofing materials to reflect sunlight away from the home are known as <strong>cool roofs</strong>. They reduce the amount of energy it takes to cool your home on a hot day, but increase the energy needed to heat your home in the winter. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>A roof’s ability to return solar heat to the atmosphere is measured by its <strong>Solar Reflectance Index.</strong> Most roofing materials have an SRI value between 0 and 100 (higher numbers indicate better performance), although it’s possible to have values outside this range. This number is a combination of two measurements, “solar reflectance” and “thermal emittance.” When comparing roofing products, the SRI is the main thing to check. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>When choosing insulation, doors, windows, etc., you’ll need to know your <strong>climate zone</strong>, which is essentially what the weather is like in the area where you live, based on temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The zones that pertain to insulation and cool roofs are more specific than the zones for windows, doors, and skylights. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The amount of electric current moving through a circuit is measured in <strong>amps</strong>, short for <strong>amperes. </strong>You’ll hear this used when discussing electrical upgrades. For example an 100-amp panel represents the maximum amount of current your home can handle at any given moment. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>An electrical <strong>load</strong> refers to any device or appliance that consumes electricity, and by proxy, the amount of power required to run it. It is measured in <strong>watts</strong>. So an EV charger could be a 7,200 watt load, and a dishwasher could be about 2,000 watts. When discussing electrical upgrades, you’ll likely hear about the load on a particular circuit. </li>
</ul><h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. Do I still need insulation if I live in a warm climate?</h4><p>
	Definitively, yes! When people hear the word “insulation” they often think of how it can protect them from the cold. And while it certainly does do that, insulation’s overall role is to slow the transfer of heat both out of your home when it’s chilly and
	<em><em> into</em></em> your home when it’s hot. That means you won’t need to use your air conditioning as much during those scorching summer days <em><em>or</em></em> your furnace as much when the temperatures drop.
</p><h4>2. Would I benefit from energy efficient upgrades if my home is relatively new?</h4><p>
	Quite possibly! The most definitive way to know if your home could be improved by weatherization is by getting a home energy audit —- more on that below. While a specific level of insulation is required for all newly constructed homes, these codes and standards are updated frequently. So if you’re feeling uncomfortable in your living space, or if you think your heating and cooling bills are unusually high, it’s definitely worth seeing what an expert thinks. And if you’re interested in getting electric appliances like a heat pump or induction stove, some wiring upgrades will almost certainly be necessary.
</p><h4>3. I already have energy efficient appliances in my home, so what’s the benefit of weatherization?</h4><p>
	Energy efficient appliances like electric heat pumps or induction stoves are fantastic ways to decarbonize your life, but serve a fundamentally different purpose than most of the upgrades that we’re going to talk about here. When you get better air sealing, insulation, windows, or doors, what you’re doing is essentially regulating the temperature of your home, making you less reliant on energy intensive heating and cooling systems. And while this can certainly lead to savings on your energy bill and a positive impact on the environment at large, these upgrades will also allow you to simply live more comfortably.
</p><h2>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED</h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="audit">1. Get a home energy audit</h4><p>
	This is the starting point for making informed decisions about any energy efficiency upgrades that you’re considering. During a home energy audit, a certified auditor (sometimes also referred to as an energy assessor or rater or verifier) will inspect your home to identify both the highest-impact and most cost-effective upgrades you can make, including how much you stand to save on your energy bills by doing so.
</p><p>
	Wyent told me checking with your local utility is a good place to start, as many offer low-cost audits. Even if your utility doesn’t do energy assessments, they may be able to point you in the direction of local auditors or state-level resources and directories. The 
	<a href="https://www.hersindex.com/find-a-hers-rater/" target="_blank"><u>Residential Energy Services Network</u></a> also provides a directory of certified assessors searchable by location, as does the <a href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/home-energy-score/home-energy-score-map" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department of Energy’s Energy Score program</u></a>, though neither list is comprehensive.
</p><p>
	Audits typically cost between $200 and $700 depending on your home’s location, size, and type, as well as the scope of the audit. Homeowners can claim 30% of the 
	<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal-tax-credits/home-energy-audit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cost of their audit</u></a> on their federal taxes, up to $150. To be eligible, make sure you find a certified home energy auditor. The DOE <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/us-department-energy-recognized-home-energy-auditor-qualified-certification-programs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>provides a list</u></a> of recognized certification programs.
</p><p>
	Important:
	<strong> Make sure the auditor performs both a </strong><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/blower-door-tests" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>blower door test</strong></u></a><strong> and a </strong><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/thermographic-inspections#:~:text=A%20thermographic%20inspection%20is%20either,walls%20in%20a%20straight%20line." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>thermographic inspection</strong></u></a><strong>. </strong>These diagnostic tools are key to determining where air leakage and heat loss/gain is occurring. <strong> </strong>
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Important!</h4>
<p>
			At the end of the audit, your auditor should provide you with a written report that includes their business employer identification number as well as an attestation that they’re certified by a qualified certification program.

</div><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="incentives">2. Learn about incentives</h4><p>
	Your energy audit isn’t the only thing eligible for a credit. 
	<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/energy-efficient-home-improvement-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The 25C Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit</u></a> allows homeowners to claim up to 30% of the cost of a variety of home upgrades, up to a combined total of $1,200 per year. This covers upgrading your insulation, windows, doors, skylights, electrical wiring, and/or electrical panel. Getting an energy audit is also included in this category.
</p><p>
	While $1,200 is the max amount you can claim for all retrofits combined, certain renovations come with their own specific limitations. Let’s break it down:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Insulation and air sealing</strong>: 30% up to $1,200 total, no additional limits. Labor costs don’t apply.</li>
<li><strong>Exterior doors</strong>: 30% up to $250 per door, total limit of $500 for all doors combined. Labor costs don’t apply. </li>
<li><strong>Exterior windows/skylights:</strong> 30% up to $600 total. Labor costs don’t apply.</li>
<li><strong>Electrical upgrades</strong>: 30% up to $600 total for panelboards and other electrical equipment with a capacity of at least 200 amps. Needs to be installed in tandem with other energy efficiency upgrades or qualifying energy appliances (such as a heat pump or central air conditioner). Labor costs <em><em>do</em></em> apply for the credit. </li>
<li><strong>Home energy audit</strong>: 30% up to $150.</li>
<li><strong>Roof: </strong>Currently, roof upgrades are not eligible for this tax credit or other federal incentives.</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> If you spend $500 on one door, 30% of that, or $150, is eligible for a tax credit. If you spend $2,000 on two doors, only $500 will be eligible.
		</p>
</div>
</div><p>
<strong>State and local incentives: </strong>
</p><ul>
<li>The Biden administration is in the process of funding the state-administered <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/federal-incentives/home-electrification-appliance-rebates" target="_blank"><u>Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates</u></a>, which provide low and moderate income households with up to $1,600 for weatherization upgrades, $4,000 for electric panel upgrades, and $2,500 for electric wiring upgrades. So far, rebate programs have been launched in New York and Wisconsin. Your state could be next! </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/federal-incentives/home-efficiency-rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Home Efficiency Rebates</u></a> are another state-administered program that will reward retrofits based on their modeled or measured level of energy savings. They are expected to roll out in 2025. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>One program that is active today for low-income homeowners and renters is the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/scep/wap/how-apply-weatherization-assistance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Weatherization Assistance Program</u></a>, which provides free weatherization services to qualifying families and individuals. If you think you might be eligible, definitely check it out.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>For cool roofs specifically, you can <a href="https://coolroofs.org/resources/financial-incentives#cool-roof-loans" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>consult this list</u></a> of state and local-level rebates and other incentives.</li>
</ul><p>
	Depending on where you live, there may be additional state and local incentives, and we suggest asking your contractor what you are eligible for. But since incentive programs change frequently, it’s a good idea to do your own research too. Get acquainted with 
	<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy Star</u></a>, a joint program run by the Environmental Protection Agency and the DOE which provides information on energy efficient products, practices, and standards. On Energy Star’s website, you can <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/homesavings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>search by zip code for utility rebates</u></a> that can help you save on insulation, windows, and electrical work.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“Starting by looking at your local utility programs can be a great resource too, because utilities offer rebates or incentives for weatherizing your home or installing a new roof,” said Wyent.</strong> </em></em>
</blockquote><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="goals">3. Consider your long-term goals</h4><p>
	Everyone wants to minimize the number of times they break open or drill into their walls. To that end, it’s useful to plan out 
	<em><em>all</em></em> the upgrades you might want to get done over the next five to 10 years to figure out where efficiency might fit in.
</p><p>
	Some primary examples: Installing appliances like a heat pump, induction stove, or Level 2 EV charger (all of which you can read more about in our <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life" target="_blank">other guides</a>) often require electrical upgrades. Even if you don’t plan to get any of these new appliances now, pre-wiring your home to prepare for their installation (with the exception of a heat pump — see our heat pump guide for more info on that) will save you money later on.
</p><p>
	De Barbaro also notes that if you’re planning to repaint your walls anytime soon, this would also be a convenient time to add insulation, as that involves drilling holes which then need to be patched and repainted anyway. Likewise, if you were already planning to replace your home’s siding, this would be a natural time to insulate. Finally, if you’re planning to get a heat pump in the coming years, getting better insulation now will ensure this system is maximally effective.
</p><p>
	Conversely, if you’re cash-strapped, spreading out electrical and weatherization upgrades over the course of a few years allows you to claim the full $1,200 tax credit every year. Whether those tax savings are enough to cover the added contractor time and clean-up costs, though, will depend on the particulars of your situation.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“Come in with a plan and talk to the contractor about everything that you want to do in the future, not just immediately,” said Wyent.</strong></em></em>

</div><h3 class="rm-anchors" id="contractor">FINDING A CONTRACTOR OR INSTALLER</h3><p>
	Unlike solar installers, which are often associated with large regional and national companies, the world of weatherization and electrical upgrades is often much more localized, meaning you’ll need to do a bit of legwork to verify that the contractors and installers you come across are reliable.
</p><p>
	Wyent told me she typically starts by asking friends, family, and neighbors for references, as well as turning to Google and Yelp reviews. Depending on where you live and what type of work you want done, your local utility may also offer incentives for weatherization and electrification upgrades, and can possibly provide a list of prescreened contractors who are licensed and insured for this type of work.
</p><h4>What to ask all contractors and installers</h4><p>
	These questions will help you vet contractors and gain a better understanding of their process regardless of the type of renovation you’re pursuing.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>How long have you been in business? </strong>If you’re hiring a local company, you’ll want to ensure that they’ve been around long enough to establish a reputation. That way you can gather references and ask friends and neighbors if they’ve worked with them before.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>What is the timeline for completion of this project, and when would you be able to start?</strong> This will vary widely by project type and scope, but you should ask your contractor to include a timeline as a part of their initial quote — and, most importantly, as a part of your final contract, if you get there. Having this in writing should help keep everyone accountable.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>What is your expected work schedule, and can I stay in my home during these renovations?</strong> Certain projects can be loud and disruptive, even if only for a few hours. Gauging just how disruptive can allow you to plan ahead and get out of the house if need be.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>What type of warranty do you offer for your work?</strong> This ensures that if a renovation is performed incorrectly, it will be fixed free of charge. The products themselves have their own separate warranties, which you should also be aware of.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Will you work with subcontractors?</strong> Clarify who is your point of contact for the project, and make sure the contractor’s insurance covers subcontractors as well.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Will these retrofits require a permit? If so, who will be in charge of securing that? </strong>Depending on where you live and what types of retrofits and upgrades you’re planning, obtaining a permit might be necessary. Ensuring that your contractor understands the nuances of local regulations and permitting processes is key.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>What is your payment schedule?</strong> Often you may be expected to pay a contractor or installer an upfront deposit. Clarify how much that will be to make sure there are no surprises, and stay away from contractors who request full payment upfront.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Will you conduct a site visit in order to get a more accurate cost and scope of work estimate?</strong> This can help you and your contractor or installer ensure that you’re on the same page about what makes the most sense for your home. Ask whether the site visit will be free or if there’s a consultation fee.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Will you use products and materials that are eligible for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit?</strong> You’ll want to let your contractor know up front that you would like to take advantage of this credit so that you can work with them to choose products that meet the required standards.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Do you know of any state or local energy efficiency incentives I might be eligible for?</strong> Make sure you’re taking advantage of all the cost savings available to you! Not all contractors will be up to date on the latest programs, though, so do your own research.</li>
</ul><p>
	Common wisdom says you should 
	<strong>always get three quotes</strong>. But that doesn’t mean you should automatically choose the cheapest option. Lstiburek says the old adage applies: “If it sounds too good to be true, it's probably too good to be true.” Be sure that your contractors and installers are properly licensed and insured and read the fine print of your contract. Beyond this, how to find qualified professionals and what to ask largely depends on the type of upgrade you are pursuing. So let’s break it down, starting with the biggest bang for your buck.
</p><h3>Air Sealing and Insulation</h3><p>
	Air sealing and insulating your home is usually the number one way to increase its energy efficiency. 
	<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate/why-seal-and-insulate#:~:text=Most%20homes%20in%20the%20United,and%20comfort%20in%20your%20home." target="_blank"><u>Energy Star says</u></a> nine out of 10 homes are underinsulated, and many also have significant air leaks. In general, homes lose more heating and cooling energy through walls and attics than through windows and doors, so air sealing and adding insulation <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/where-insulate-home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in key areas</u></a> should be your first priority.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“People don't realize how collectively, small holes everywhere add up. So on average here in Pennsylvania, typically those holes would add up to the surface of three sheets of paper, continuously open to the outdoors,” said de Barbaro.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	Determining where air is escaping is the purpose of the 
	<a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/blower-door-tests" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blower door test</u></a> and the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/thermographic-inspections#:~:text=A%20thermographic%20inspection%20is%20either,walls%20in%20a%20straight%20line." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>thermographic inspection</u></a>, so after your energy audit you should have a good idea of where to begin with these retrofits. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/where-insulate-home" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>This guide from the Department of Energy</u></a> is a great resource on all the places in a home one might consider insulating.
</p><p>
<strong>Choosing an insulation type:</strong>
</p><p>
	Every home is different, and the type of insulation you choose will depend on a number of factors including where you’re insulating, whether that area is finished or unfinished, what R-Value is right for your climate, and your budget. You can check out 
	<a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/types-insulation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>this comprehensive list of different insulation types</u></a> to learn about their respective advantages and use cases. But when it comes to attic rafters and exterior walls, De Barbaro said that one option rises above the rest.
</p><blockquote>
<strong><em><em>“The magic word here is </em></em><em><em>dense-packed </em></em><em><em>cellulose insulation</em></em></strong><em><em><strong>!” De Barbaro told me.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	This type of insulation (which falls under the “loose fill and blown-in” category) is made from recycled paper products, meaning it has very low embodied carbon emissions. It’s also cheap and effective. For exterior walls and attic rafters, be sure to 
	<strong>avoid</strong> loose-fill cellulose, as that can settle and become less effective over time — although for attic floors, loose-fill works well. Both are installed by drilling holes into the wall or floor space and blowing the insulation in under pressure.
</p><p>
	We recommend discussing all of these options with your contractor, but here are the other materials you’re most likely to come across:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Exterior walls</strong>: For some <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate/identify-problems-you-want-fix/diy-checks-inspections/insulation-r-values" target="_blank"><u>climate zones,</u> </a>Energy Star recommends adding “insulative wall sheathing” to your blown-in insulation. This usually means adding <strong>foam board </strong>or<strong> rigid foam insulation</strong> beneath your siding. In this case, De Barbaro recommends <a href="https://www.polyiso.org/?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Polyiso</u></a> rigid foam insulation, due to its low environmental impact. Removing your siding is a big, expensive task, though, so you would likely only add this additional layer if you were planning to replace your siding anyway. </li>
<li><strong>Basement or crawlspace</strong>: Energy Star recommends either insulative wall sheathing (again, Polyiso is a great choice), or <strong>batt insulation</strong>. Batts are pre-cut, flat pieces of insulation that look like a blanket and are usually made of fiberglass, mineral wool or sheep’s wool. </li>
</ul><h4>Finding an air sealing and insulation contractor: </h4><p>
	In addition to asking friends, family, and your local utility for contractor recommendations, 
	<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/ask-the-experts/how-hire-attic-insulation-contractor" target="_blank"><u>Energy Star specifically recommends</u></a> these additional resources where you can find licensed and insured contractors for insulation work.
</p><ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/asset/document/HPwES_GETTING%20STARTED%20GUIDE_102816.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Home Performance with Energy Star program</u></a>. You can <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/improvements/professionals/become-program-sponsor/full-list" target="_blank"><u>find a local program here</u></a>, and contact the affiliated organization to obtain a list of participating contractors in your area.<br/>
</li>
<li><a href="https://locate.bpi.org/" target="_blank"><u>The Building Performance Institute</u></a> lets you search contractors by zip code.<br/>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.owenscorning.com/en-us/insulation/find-a-certified-energy-expert" target="_blank"><u>Owens Corning Certified Energy Experts</u></a> also lets you search for contractors by zip code.</li>
</ul><h4>Things to know before reaching out to contractors:</h4><ul>
<li>Where in your home you are losing the most heat. The results of your energy audit should give you this information.</li>
<li>How much insulation you currently have (if any) in your attic floor, exterior walls, and basement or crawlspace. This is also something your home energy auditor can help you figure out. </li>
<li>What climate zone you are in, and what R-Value is recommended both for that zone and for the part of your house that you are insulating. For wood-framed buildings, which comprise the vast majority of single-family homes, <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/saveathome/seal_insulate/identify-problems-you-want-fix/diy-checks-inspections/insulation-r-values" target="_blank"><u>you can find that information here</u></a>. </li>
<li>“Knob and tube wiring” found in older homes can pose a fire hazard if it comes into contact with insulation, so tell your contractor if your house was built in the 1930’s or earlier.</li>
</ul><h4>Questions to ask potential air-sealing and insulation contractors:</h4><ul>
<li><strong>Will you seal all gaps and cracks before adding insulation?</strong> If a contractor doesn’t agree to this, find another one! The benefits of the added insulation will go largely to waste if air sealing isn’t completed first.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Do your insulation and air sealing materials meet the </strong><a href="https://www.nahb.org/advocacy/top-priorities/building-codes/code-development/2024-international-energy-conservation-code" target="_blank"><u><strong>International Energy Conservation Code</strong></u><strong> </strong></a><strong>standards?</strong> This is required to be eligible for tax credits.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Are you able to install my preferred type of insulation, and is this the type of insulation you would also recommend?</strong> It’s good to come in with some ideas and preferences, but listen to what your contractor has to say about what they think would work best for your home too. Get a number of different opinions.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Do you offer attic hatch cover or attic door insulation?</strong> If you’re doing your attic, insulating these areas ensures that you get the most energy savings possible.</li>
</ul><h3>Windows, Doors, and Skylights</h3><p>
	While air sealing and insulation should definitely be number one on your weatherization checklist, plenty of heat gets lost through windows, doors, and skylights, as well. Single pane glass is a particularly poor insulator, and while fewer houses these days have it, upgrading to 
	<strong>double or triple pane</strong> windows or skylights can be a big energy saver. Likewise, <strong>steel or fiberglass doors</strong> are much better insulators than traditional wooden doors.
</p><p>
	But be warned: These can be pricey upgrades. The cost of installing windows alone ranges from hundreds of dollars up to $1,500 
	<em><em>per window, </em></em>and many homes have ten or more. It’s unlikely you’ll fully recoup the outlay through your energy savings, so before going about these retrofits, be sure that you’ve taken care of the easy stuff first.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<p>
			There are a couple, less expensive alternatives to a full window and door replacement. One is getting 
			<a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/storm-windows" target="_blank"><strong>storm windows</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/doors#:~:text=it%20needs%20replacement.-,Storm%20Doors,-Adding%20a%20storm" target="_blank"><strong>storm doors</strong></a> installed to provide an added layer of insulation. While this option has been around for a long time, older models were usually made of clear glass, while newer versions offer a <strong>low-emissivit</strong>y (e.k.a. <strong>low-e</strong>) coating that greatly improves the glass’s insulating abilities. Installing these yourself can make for a relatively easy <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/do-it-yourself-savings-project-install-exterior-storm-windows-low-e-coating" target="_blank">DIY project</a> — or, as always, you can go with a certified professional.
		</p>
<p>
			You can also opt for what’s called an 
			<strong>insert window replacement</strong> or a <strong>pocket window replacement</strong>, which is when you replace just the window glass but keep the existing frame. If your frame is in good condition and airtight, this will likely save you money and simplify the installation process.
		</p>
<p>
			One last cost saving tip: Don’t sleep on the power of 
			<a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/energy-efficient-window-coverings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">simple window coverings</a> like <strong>shades</strong> or <strong>blinds</strong>! They come in a variety of styles and can be powerful insulators, given that you remember to strategically open and close them throughout the day.

</div>
</div><h4>Things to know before reaching out to contractors and installers:</h4><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/building_products/residential_windows_doors_and_skylights/climate_zone/search" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>What climate zone you are in</u></a>, as this will impact the type of windows, doors, and skylights that work for you. </li>
<li>To be eligible for a federal tax credit, new windows and skylights must be designated “<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/most-efficient/me-certified-windows/results?is_most_efficient_filter=Most%20Efficient" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Most Efficient</u></a>” by Energy Star. The online database lets you filter by climate zone, window or door type, brand, and frame material. While doors don’t need this designation to be eligible for the tax credit, they do have to meet other Energy Star criteria. (Currently no storm windows or storm doors appear to be designated “Most Efficient,” but you can find a list of Energy Star-certified <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-storm-windows/results?formId=5471-8-48-2-45022&scrollTo=654.4000244140625&search_text=&markets_filter=United+States&zip_code_filter=&product_types=Select+a+Product+Category&sort_by=emissivity&sort_direction=asc&page_number=0&lastpage=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>storm windows here</u></a>.)</li>
<li>What type of windows and doors you currently have and what type of windows and doors you might want. Familiarize yourself with the various <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/window-types-and-technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>window styles and technologies</u></a>, and check out the websites of some major manufacturers such as <a href="https://www.marvin.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Marvin</u></a>, <a href="https://www.pella.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Pella</u></a>, <a href="https://www.jeld-wen.com/en-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Jeld-Wen</u></a>, or <a href="https://www.andersenwindows.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Anderson</u></a> to get a sense of what you’re looking for. For storm windows in particular, most Energy Star-certified models are from <a href="https://www.quantapanel.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Quantapanel</u></a>. </li>
</ul><p>
	Once you’ve done your research, it’s time to schedule a consultation with an installer, who can help you refine your project needs, discuss design and installation options, and provide you with a quote.
</p><h4>Questions to ask potential contractors or installers:</h4><ul>
<li><strong>Can you show me an example of what we’re talking about? </strong>Window installers may be able to bring a corner cut of a window or a full example window to your home so you can assess color and frame style. Doors are more difficult, but if the company has a showroom, it’s a good idea to check that out.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Who is the manufacturer of these windows/doors/skylights? </strong>Installers may show you products from multiple companies, but you’ll want to know the manufacturer and the model so that you can verify that it’s Energy Star certified and eligible for tax credits.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Are you a certified installer of [insert brand here] windows and/or skylights and/or doors? </strong>Major window and door manufacturers such as Marvin, Jeld-Wen, Pella, and Anderson will have a network of certified installers, and once you’ve decided to go with a particular brand, you should ensure that your installer is certified with that manufacturer.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“So if you pick a Marvin window, make sure that you have a Marvin certified installer in your location, installing the Marvin window according to the Marvin instructions.” said Lstiburek.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>How strong is the glass in these windows? </strong>Double-strength glass is less subject to breakage and may be worth the slight cost premium, especially because some glass warranties only cover double-strength glass.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>How long will it take for things to be delivered? </strong>Know that high performance windows can take up to 12 weeks for delivery, especially if they’re made to order or require any customization. Prepare yourself for a wait.</li>
</ul><h3>Roofs</h3><p>
	Insulating your attic floor or your roof rafters is the best way to ensure that your home is sealed off from the elements. But if you live in a hot climate and need a new roof anyway (most last 25 to 50 years), then you might consider getting a cool roof, which can be made from a variety of materials and installed on almost any slope. However, they won’t lead to energy efficiencies in all geographies, so be sure to do your research beforehand!
</p><h4>Things to know before reaching out to roofers:</h4><ul>
<li>What <a href="https://basc.pnnl.gov/resource-guides/cool-roofs-and-walls-reduce-heat-gain#edit-group-climate" target="_blank"><u>climate zone</u></a> you’re in, and thus how beneficial (or not) a cool roof would be. While a cool roof will be at least slightly beneficial in most climate zones, if you live in a very cold place (zone 7 or 8), a cool roof will probably be detrimental, as the need for more heating when it’s cold will outweigh the energy savings when it’s warm.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>What type of roofing materials and finishes you are interested in. Consult <a href="https://coolroofs.org/directory/roof" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the database</u></a> of products from the <a href="https://coolroofs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cool Roof Rating Council</u></a> to compare the performance of various roofing products based on their Solar Reflectance Index (see glossary above). You can also filter by material, color, manufacturer and roof slope. </li>
<li>What type of roof you currently have, and what type of roof you might want. Check out homes in your neighborhood similar to get a sense of prevailing styles and what might suit your home. You can also check out the websites of some <a href="https://roofsimple.com/best-roofing-manufacturers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major roofing companies </u></a>to see what styles they offer. </li>
<li>Roofers are also often knowledgeable about the most popular roofing colors and styles for homes like yours, and can be a valuable resource in helping you make your selection.</li>
</ul><h4>Questions to ask potential contractors or installers:</h4><ul>
<li><strong>Are you a member of any professional roofing associations? </strong>Affiliation with a reputable roofing association is a good sign, indicating that your roofer is staying up to date on industry standards. Along with the <a href="https://www.nrca.net/" target="_blank"><u>National Roofing Contractors Association</u></a>, there are numerous regional associations including ones for the <a href="https://nerca.org/" target="_blank"><u>Northeast</u></a>, <a href="https://www.mrca.org/aws/MRCA/pt/sp/home_page" target="_blank"><u>Midwest</u></a>, <a href="https://wsrca.com/" target="_blank"><u>Western</u></a>, and <a href="https://marcaroof.com/" target="_blank"><u>Mid-Atlantic</u></a> areas.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Will you bring roofing samples to help me choose what color and style would best suit my home? </strong>While looking at products online can be helpful, Heatmap recommends waiting to make a final decision until you can see examples in person.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Are you associated with a roofing manufacturer or a certified installer for any particular manufacturers? </strong>Much like with windows,<strong> </strong>major roofing manufacturers such as GAF, Owens Corning, or Englert often have a network of roofers who are trained on their particular products. So if you’re interested in purchasing roofing products from a particular manufacturer, choosing a roofer who is affiliated with them is a prudent choice.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Will you perform a full inspection of my roof? </strong>Before providing you with a cost estimate, a roofer should perform a full roof inspection, including your attic, to evaluate the scope of the project and provide you with an accurate quote.</li>
</ul><h3>Wiring and Electric Panels</h3><p>
	Last but certainly not least is a retrofit that’s a little different from the rest. Unlike getting insulation, new windows, or a new roof, upgrading your wiring or electric panel doesn’t lead to greater energy efficiency by regulating the temperature of your home. What it does instead is enable
	<em> </em>greater energy efficiency by making it possible to operate an increasing number of electrified appliances and devices in your house.
</p><p>
	For example, getting an electric or induction stove or dryer, a standard heat pump, a heat pump water heater, or an electric vehicle charger will require that you add new electric circuits to support these devices. And as these new loads add up, you may need to install a larger electric panel to support it all.
</p><p>
	After sourcing electrician recommendations from family and friends, a good place to turn is 
	<a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/projects/electrical-panel-homeowner" target="_blank"><u>Rewiring America’s contractor directory network</u></a>. (Rewiring America is also a sponsor of Decarbonize Your Life.)Networks in your area can then provide you with a list of qualified electricians.
</p><h4>Things to know before reaching out to electricians:</h4><ul>
<li>What your long-term home electrification goals are. As previously mentioned, it will save you time and money to do as many electrification upgrades as possible in one go. </li>
<li>The <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/articles/electrical-panel/how-to-determine-home-electrical-panel-size" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>size of your current electric panel</u></a>. You can find this information on your main breaker or fuse, a label on the panel itself, or your electric meter. Buying a new electric panel usually costs thousands of dollars, so knowing what size you’re currently working with can help ensure you’re not getting upsold. Typical is 100 amps, and that’s <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/articles/electrical-panel/how-to-electrify-home-100-amp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>often large enough</u></a> for homes to fully electrify, Wyent told me; if you’re going to upgrade though, more than 200 amps is almost never necessary.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“Most people are really only using somewhere around 40% of what their current panels space. So you can actually add a fair amount of new circuits to your existing panel and upgrade your wiring while not having to upgrade your panel at all,” Wyent said.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>Even if you are running out of space on your current panel, you don’t necessarily need a new one — there are <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/articles/electrical-panel/how-to-electrify-home-100-amp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>technologies and methods</u></a> to work around this. For example, Wyent told me you can purchase circuit sharing devices like a smart splitter or a circuit pauser that would allow you to put multiple loads on the same circuit or shut off certain appliances when you’re approaching your panel’s limit. Or you could get an entire smart panel (though that’s quite pricey), which automatically modulates your loads.</li>
</ul><h4>Questions to ask potential electricians:</h4><ul>
<li><strong>Will you need to shut off power and for how long? </strong>Most electrical work involves shutting off the power for a bit. Knowing how long this will take, and if the whole house or just particular rooms will be affected will allow you to plan around it.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>Will you perform an electrical safety inspection as a part of the job? </strong>These types of periodic inspections are important, and if an inspection isn’t automatically performed as a part of the job, it could be worth tacking it on for an extra charge.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>What technologies would allow me to keep my existing panel while also adding more electrical appliances? </strong>As discussed, there are numerous ways to avoid having to upgrade your panel, and you should be able to discuss these options with your electrician.<br/>
</li>
<li>If getting a new panel, <strong>does this panel meet the standards of the </strong><a href="https://www.esfi.org/workplace-safety/industry-codes-regulations/the-national-electrical-code-nec/#:~:text=The%20National%20Electrical%20Code%20(NEC)%2C%20or%20NFPA%2070%2C,Fire%20Protection%20Association%20(NFPA)." target="_blank"><u><strong>National Electric Code</strong></u></a><strong>?</strong> This is required for federal tax credit eligibility.</li>
</ul><h3 class="rm-anchors" id="contract">REVIEWING OPTIONS AND SIGNING YOUR CONTRACT</h3><p>
	Once you have three quotes in hand, all that’s left to do is evaluate your options, choose a contractor or installer, and sign a contract. Cost will likely be a major factor in the decision, but you’ll also want to ensure that the cheapest quote doesn’t mean corners will be cut. Here’s what to look out for.
</p><p>
<strong>Pay close attention to warranties. </strong>This applies both to the warranty for the work being performed and to the warranties for the products themselves. If an installation job or a product is well priced but comes with a short warranty, this should give you pause.
</p><p>
<strong>Avoid “same day signing specials.” </strong>If you’re being rushed into signing a contract, this is also a bad sign. Be sure to read the fine print — most cost estimates should be good for a few weeks at minimum.
</p><p>
<strong>Get specific. </strong>Your quotes should specify the type of work being performed, the scope of the work, cost (broken down by materials, labor, permits, and other expenses), payment method, and a tentative timeline for completion. A quote is much less formal than a contract, so if some of this information isn’t provided up front, don’t hesitate to ask for clarification so that you can make apples-to-apples comparisons between different contractors.
</p><p>
<strong>When you get a contract in hand, double check that:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li>The materials and products listed are the same as the ones you discussed, that they meet the requirements for your climate zone, and (if relevant) are Energy Star certified.</li>
<li>There are exact values listed for the relevant metrics. You should see R-Values for insulation, U-Values and SHGC for windows, doors, and skylights, and the Solar Reflectance Index for roofs. </li>
<li>The payment schedule — including upfront deposits — aligns with your expectations.</li>
<li>Warranty information for both labor and materials/products is included.</li>
<li>The timeline is clear, with start and end dates listed. </li>
<li>The contractor’s license and insurance information is provided.</li>
</ul><p>
	Then it’s time to sign, sit back, and enjoy the soothing sounds of hammering, drilling, insulation blowing, and wire tinkering, content in knowing that you’re decarbonizing your home down to its very bones!
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline"><strong>Important!</strong></h4>
<p>
			Keep all of your invoices and receipts from contractors and installers. You might need this information to claim your federal tax credit or for other state and local incentives. More on that below!
		</p>
</div>
</div><h2>WHAT’S NEXT?</h2><h3 class="rm-anchors" id="credits">Claim your tax credits</h3><p>
	Now that you’re living comfortably in a maximally energy efficient home, you’re probably wondering when you’ll start seeing all those incentives you researched pay off. First off, know that you must wait until all renovations are complete and paid for to claim your federal tax credit. That means that even if you purchased new windows this year, if you have them installed in 2025, you’ll file for a tax credit with your 2025 return. Here’s how to go about it.
</p><ul>
<li>Find the invoice(s) from your contractor(s) for all qualified energy efficient upgrades you made this last tax year.<br/>
</li>
<li>Fill out <a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-5695" target="_blank"><u>IRS Form 5695, Residential Energy Credits</u></a>. For more information on filling out the form and a reminder of the amount that you can claim for various projects, <a href="https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i5695" target="_blank"><u>see here</u></a>. Remember that labor costs for insulation, windows, doors, and skylights do not apply. Labor costs <em><em>do</em></em> apply for electrical upgrades though.<br/>
</li>
<li>When it’s time to file your taxes, submit the form alongside your tax return. Note that you can claim this tax credit and also take the standard deduction, no need to itemize.</li>
<li>Enjoy your savings!</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Note</h4>
<p>
			You cannot receive more money back in tax credits than you owe in taxes. So if you qualify for $900 of home energy efficiency upgrades but owe just $400 in taxes, you’ll receive a $400 tax credit.
		</p>
</div>
</div><p>
	For state and local incentives, check the website for your local utility as well your local and state government and energy office to see what documentation is required. When in doubt, 
	<strong>keep all of your records and receipts</strong>!

## Why You Should Future-Proof Your Home Appliances

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NDkwMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MzQxOTY4Mn0.PyA8VDiD2PFkEk_l-pIRjT9-H9nXzJAgOgP7F5dfDCI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=244%2C0%2C156%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Buildings are one of the few places where individuals have direct control over greenhouse gas emissions. You can’t instantly reduce a farmer’s beef production by eating less meat or personally shut down a natural gas power plant. But if you’re a homeowner, it’s up to you whether or not you’re burning fossil fuels every time you heat your home, use hot water, dry your clothes, or cook food. Together, these activities account for about <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/us-ghg-inventory-2024-chapter-3-energy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>7% of annual U.S. fossil fuel-related carbon emissions</u></a>.
</p><p>
	That may not sound like a lot, but it adds up. When you buy a new heating system or a new clothes dryer, you’re investing in a machine you’re going to use for 15 to 20 years or more. You can decide to lock in a system that burns fossil fuels and is guaranteed to add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere throughout that time — or you can invest in one that can drive down emissions as the electric grid becomes cleaner. (If you want some advice for which new appliances to go with, we have <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/how-to-get-a-heat-pump" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/best-induction-stoves" target="_blank">guides</a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/best-water-heaters" target="_blank">for</a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/best-washer-dryers" target="_blank">that</a>.)</p><p>
	“There’s an inflection point that we’re facing right now,” Sara Baldwin, the senior electrification director at the think tank Energy Innovation, told me. “If we lock in another two decades of fossil fuel infrastructure in our homes, we’ve got way more work down the line.”
</p><p>
	That’s not to say these are easy changes to make. Perhaps it’s not even totally fair to say “it’s up to you,” because for some homeowners, the cost of making some of these changes will be out of reach. Electric appliances are often more expensive to install than their fossil fuel counterparts. And in some cases, as in places where natural gas is much cheaper than electricity, the switch might also increase your energy bills, even though the appliances themselves are more efficient.
</p><p>
	If you have the means, though, the benefits can be significant. Replacing your furnace with an electric heat pump — which can both heat and cool your home — could have two-for-one benefits for those without central air, especially as summers get hotter. Many homeowners also praise the quieter, more even temperature control that heat pumps provide. Electrify any of your appliances and you’ll also be helping to reduce local outdoor air pollution; switch to an electric cooktop and you’ll reduce indoor air pollution for you and your family, as well.

	Another way to think about electrification is as a chance to leave your mark on the world. Political scientist Leah Stokes, who serves as policy counsel to the electrification advocacy group Rewiring America in addition to teaching at the University of California, Santa Barbara, told me she likes to think of the appliances in our homes as “the infrastructure that we are in charge of.” You can lobby your representatives to build bike lanes, but the decision is mostly out of your hands. You’re the only one that can decide to change out your furnace or your water heater, however. “These are huge opportunities for us to make legacy impacts on carbon pollution,” Stokes said. And unlike behavioral changes such as eating vegetarian, you only have to do it once. “If you sell that house, if you die, it's a piece of infrastructure that continues on.”
</p><p>
	Making these changes won’t necessarily result in immediate emission reductions. It depends on where you live and where your power comes from. If a lot of your electricity comes from coal, for example, a natural gas furnace might emit less carbon than even the most efficient heat pump. But that’s just how the math works out today. Researchers who have modeled out the emissions impacts over the average lifetime of the equipment — about 16 years — have found that as the grid continues along its trajectory of getting cleaner, <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/press/2024/benefits-of-heat-pumps-detailed-in-new-nrel-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>heat pumps will emit less carbon overall</u></a> in every state.
</p><p>
	Not every home electrification project will get you the same carbon bang for your buck. Space heating is by far the most energy-intensive thing we do in our homes, so from an emissions standpoint, replacing your boiler or furnace is the most effective change you can make. Clothes dryers and stoves use so little energy, comparatively, that swapping them out looks almost inconsequential for the climate, at least on paper.
</p><p>
	But the reason electrifying your home can be such a high leverage action is not just because of the absolute emission reductions you can achieve. It can also accelerate structural changes. If you’re currently a natural gas customer, going fully electric means you’ll be able to disconnect from the local distribution system and stop paying into the pool of funds used to maintain it. That can increase rates for the remaining customers, which is far from ideal. But it also makes the economics of electrification more attractive.
</p><p>
	“It's very important that we can't leave low income people behind,” said Stokes. “But the more folks who get off of gas, even a small number, it can really start to force the question of, should we start thinking about if we should be investing hundreds of millions of dollars into aging gas infrastructure? Or should we use that money to subsidize electrification for low income folks?”
</p><p>
	So, where to begin? Space heating is the biggest opportunity, but it’s also the most expensive and complicated project. There’s no reason you have to start there, especially if your existing heater has a lot of life left in it. “Don't start with the hardest thing,” said Baldwin. “If it feels daunting, start with the easiest thing, or start with something that feels within reach.”
</p><p>
	Larry Waters, an HVAC contractor I interviewed for our heat pump guide, recommends making a “gas inventory” — a list of all of your gas appliances and how old they are. Replace whichever appliance is nearest to the end of its useful life first, but plan ahead for future projects. Figure out if you’ll need to budget in an electrical upgrade, or if you can combine any of the work to save money.
</p><p>
	The following guides will help you navigate each of these projects, with recommendations from experts who are on the ground, helping homeowners through this every day.

## Everything You Need to Know About Heat Pumps

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0MjY0NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzA2MTA3MX0.eCvh-idyfT9DAFouQjigx5WRNcsWQwW4v_ebsERymFA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=200%2C0%2C200%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The term “heat pump” refers to any system that can extract heat from a colder space and transfer it to a warmer one. For example, refrigerators use heat pumps to remove heat from inside the fridge and expel it into your kitchen. Air conditioners use heat pumps to remove heat from inside the house and dump it outside. In this guide, the phrase “heat pump” refers specifically to HVAC equipment that is capable of both heating 
	<em><em>and</em></em> cooling the air inside a home. In other words, we’re talking about air conditioners that can also run in reverse, pulling heat from outside on a winter day and pumping it inside.<br/>
</p><p>
	We’ve created this guide because when it comes to getting off fossil fuels, it 
	<em><em>does</em></em> matter what you replace them with. Climate advocates tout electric heat pumps because they can create two to three times more heat per unit of energy than other heating equipment. Electric resistance heating, by contrast, is extremely wasteful, and if people start installing those systems en masse, that could actually increase emissions in the near term and make it <em><em>more difficult</em></em> to decarbonize the economy in the long term. By getting a heat pump, you won’t just be cutting emissions, you’ll be reducing the cost of cleaning up the electric grid because we’ll need less electricity overall.
</p><p>
	That said, a poorly designed or installed system can negate many of the benefits that heat pumps have to offer. Whether you’re reading because you want to cut emissions, or save money on energy, or take advantage of the steady, quiet comfort heat pumps provide, it’s essential to do your homework and find a good contractor to work with. In this guide, we’ll cover how to know when it’s the right time to get heat pumps, the basics of understanding what your options are, common misconceptions about heat pumps, how to find and vet contractors, and more.

</ul><h2>THE BASICS</h2><p>
	There are many, many kinds of electric heat pumps used for space heating and cooling. At a high level, there are two main categories that homeowners can typically choose from:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Air source</strong> systems pull heat out of the ambient air. These are the most common.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Geothermal </strong>or<strong> ground-source</strong> systems pull heat out of the ground. These are much more efficient than air-source versions, especially when providing heating in the coldest northern climates, but are more expensive to install. </li>
</ul><p>
	Within each of these are a handful of installation options:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Ducted</strong> systems have a similar footprint to a furnace or central air conditioner, including one big piece of equipment in the basement, attic, or crawlspace that forces hot or cold air into ducts distributed throughout your house and another big piece of equipment that sits outside. They typically have better air filtration capabilities than ductless systems.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Ductless</strong> systems, often referred to as <strong>mini-splits </strong>or <strong>multi-splits</strong>, also have both indoor and outdoor components, but the indoor units are designed to cool a single room or zone of the house. The indoor unit can be a wall-mounted “cassette,” or it can be hidden away in the wall or ceiling and force air through a vent.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>There are also <strong>slim duct </strong>or <strong>compact ducted</strong> systems, which take a little bit from both approaches. The indoor unit can be hidden in the ceiling or floor, and they utilize a small duct system to heat/cool two or three adjacent rooms.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Air to water heat pumps</strong> heat or chill water and circulate it through a building. These are common in Europe but less so in the U.S. Marin said they can be a good option for some homes that already have water-based HVAC systems like radiant floors, ceilings, or walls; hydronic fan coils; or panel radiators. Unfortunately, the technology can’t currently integrate into homes that use cast-iron radiators.</li>
</ul><p>
	The above designs aren’t mutually exclusive. You can install a system that’s fully ducted, fully ductless, or a combination of both. You can also combine a heat pump system with a fuel-burning furnace or boiler, known as a 
	<strong>dual-fuel system</strong>. If aesthetics are important to you, there are also companies like <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/quilt-heat-pump-on-sale-date" target="_self"><u>Quilt</u></a> that offer versions that can better integrate into the look of your home.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">A note on ductwork</h4>
<p>
			Using existing ductwork can be one of the most cost-effective ways to install a heat pump, but it’s not always the right one. Ducts that were designed to distribute air from a furnace or an air conditioner might be too small to work well with a heat pump. That’s because furnaces put out hotter air than heat pumps, and so don’t require as much air to flow through the system to distribute the heat around. In those cases, Richardson typically recommends ductless heat pumps, because replacing ductwork can be a very expensive and disruptive endeavor.
		</p>
<p>
			You’ll also want to replace (or forego using) your ductwork if it's more than 20 years old, Waters told me. If you do reuse your ductwork, you’ll want to make sure your contractor ensures that it is insulated and well-sealed.
		</p>
<p>
			There are cases where it may make sense to install new ductwork if your house doesn’t already have it — if you have an unfinished attic, for example, you may want to install ducts in the floor to reach all the rooms in the top floor of your home. You could do the same thing in the ceiling of an unfinished basement.
		</p>
<blockquote>
<strong><em>“Ductwork in unfinished space is easy. Ductwork in finished space is so expensive and hard that we typically don't recommend it,” said Richardson.</em></strong>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div><p>
	Heat pumps also come in models with different “speeds” or “stages”:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Single speed </strong>or<strong> single stage heat pumps</strong> are always either on at full capacity or off. These are the cheapest heat pumps on the market, but also the worst when it comes to efficiency and may cost you more in the long run. These are typically not eligible for incentive programs, either.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>By contrast, <strong>variable speed heat pumps </strong>(also known as <strong>inverter heat pumps</strong>) can run at lower speeds and are much more efficient. Rather than cycling on, blasting hot or cold air to meet the temperature you want, and then cycling off, variable speed heat pumps modulate their capacity continuously and can run at very slow speeds to maintain the set temperature. They are the most expensive, but also the most efficient models. All three of our experts prefer variable speed systems.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>In between, there are also <strong>two-stage </strong>and<strong> multistage </strong>versions that can operate at a range of fixed speeds.</li>
</ul><p>
	There are also some technical specifications to be aware of, such as seasonal efficiency ratings:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>SEER2 </strong>is the <strong>Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (or Rating)</strong>, which is generally a measure of the efficiency of the device when it’s in cooling mode. (The 2 refers to new federal standards that went into effect in 2023.) A higher number = more efficient.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>HSPF2 </strong>is the <strong>Heating Seasonal Performance Factor</strong>, which is generally a measure of the efficiency of the device when it’s in heating mode. Again, a higher number = more efficient.</li>
</ul><p>
	The highest rated SEER2 device may have a lower HSPF2 rating, while the highest rated HSPF2 device may have a lower SEER2 rating.
</p><ul>
<li>If you live in a climate with long, cold winters, you should prioritize a higher HSPF2. </li>
<li>Prioritize SEER2 if you live somewhere with long, hot summers and milder winters. </li>

<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">What’s a “cold climate” heat pump?</h4>
<p>
			The term “cold climate” heat pump is squishier than it sounds. It generally refers to heat pumps that heat effectively and maintain their efficiency when the temperature drops well below freezing for extended periods of time. The Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnership, or NEEP, is a regional nonprofit that 
			<a href="https://ashp.neep.org/#!/" target="_blank"><u>maintains a list</u></a> of models that it considers to be cold climate heat pumps, and defines them as ductless, variable speed systems with an HSPF2 greater than 8.5 or ducted, variable speed systems with an HSPF2 greater than 7.7, among other technical specifications. The EPA’s EnergyStar program has <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/heat_pump_water_heaters/key-product-criteria" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a slightly different definition</u></a> for its “cold climate” designation.
		</p>
</div>
</div><p>
	Finally, heat pumps also come in many different sizes. 
	<strong>Having a properly sized system is one of the most important factors for ensuring your heat pumps run efficiently and last a long time.</strong>
</p><p>
	A good contractor will be able to walk you through different system designs and equipment options to find the answer that’s best suited to your house, your goals, and your budget.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“There’s a lot of companies out there that offer just what they have in the catalog and their salespeople can’t sell anything outside of that,” Waters told me. “That means the customer is going to get matched with that cookie cutter option if they go with that company. So how to choose a contractor is one of the most important things.”</strong></em></em></blockquote><h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. How does having a heat pump differ from a furnace or boiler?</h4><p>
	Many people are used to setting their HVAC systems to different temperatures at different times of day — one temp for the morning and evening, another for when they leave for work, and another for bedtime. This makes sense with many furnaces and air conditioners because they’re usually designed to cycle on, blast hot or cold air at full capacity until they achieve the temperature you want, and then turn off, so turning down the system when you’re not home can save a lot of energy. But the most efficient “variable speed” heat pumps work differently — they use a lot of energy to reach a certain temperature, but once they hit it, they sip small amounts of energy to maintain it. Experts say a “set it and forget it” approach will give you the most efficient performance and the most consistent energy bills.
</p><blockquote>
<em><strong>“Don’t worry about the number,” says Marin. “Just find your comfortable temperature, and then leave it alone, forget it’s even there.”</strong></em>
</blockquote><h4>2. Do I need to keep my boiler or furnace as a back-up system?</h4><p>
	This topic can be divisive among HVAC experts, but in most of the continental U.S., you should be able to find a heat pump solution that will heat your home efficiently on the coldest winter days. The key is that the system has to be sized correctly. Richardson’s company, Elephant Energy, works in Colorado, where he says they’ve had two years in a row with days that got down to -13 degrees Fahrenheit, “and our fleet of hundreds of heat pumps have cranked out heat to keep homes nice and warm on those coldest days.”<br/>
<br/>
	There still may be scenarios where you <em>want</em> to keep your furnace as a back-up, even if it’s not strictly necessary.
</p><ul>
<li>Maybe you don’t want to spend extra on a heat pump that’s rated for the coldest temps, so you keep your other system to kick on when the mercury drops below a certain level.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Maybe you live in a place where gas is currently much cheaper than electricity. With a dual-fuel system you can reduce your gas use and your emissions without relying solely on electricity. In the future, if gas prices go up or electricity prices come down, you can always change the temperature at which the system switches over to use more of one and less of the other.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Maybe you haven’t weatherized your house and aren’t ready to do so yet, but you do really want or need a heat pump. In this case, you can talk to your contractor about getting a variable speed heat pump sized to what they anticipate your home’s load will be once it is weatherized in the future. That means it will technically be undersized in the near term, but if you keep your existing furnace or boiler, it can make up the difference in the meantime. This way, after you weatherize, you can get rid of the back-up fuel system and rely fully on the heat pump. It “might buy you the flexibility to do things in a different order,” says Marin.</li>
</ul><h4>3. Will a heat pump help me save money?</h4><p>
	If you’re switching from fuel oil, propane, or electric resistance heating, you’re pretty much guaranteed to save money on your bills with heat pumps. But if you’re switching from natural gas, it really <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heat-pumps-national-renewable-energ-lab" target="_self"><u>depends on where you live</u></a>.
</p><p>
	Richardson says that for a lot of his customers in Colorado, making the switch from gas to inverter heat pumps is cost neutral — they end up paying a bit more for heating in the winter but less for cooling in the summer, since the heat pump is often more efficient than whatever air conditioning they were replacing. At the same time, those who don't have air conditioning to start with could end up paying a bit more year-round.
</p><h2><span></span>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED</h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="timing">1. Is it the right time to get heat pumps? Here are a few scenarios to consider.</h4><p>
<strong>Do you…</strong>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Have a relatively new (less-than-10-year-old) heating and/or cooling system in your house? </strong></li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Short answer: Hold off on a heat pump, invest in weatherization.</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Long answer: </strong>You may have arrived at this guide because you’re interested in decarbonizing your home, but if you have a relatively new heating and/or cooling system, it could actually be <em><em>worse</em></em>, emissions-wise, to replace it, due to the embedded carbon that went into manufacturing that equipment. Unless you’re really desperate to replace your existing system for comfort or financial reasons (if you have electric resistance heaters, for example, switching to heat pumps could save you a lot of money, since they use about a third of the electricity), we recommend getting a bit more life out of it first.
</p><p>
	In the meantime, put your enthusiasm for decarbonization into making your home more efficient. Insulating and air sealing your home before you get heat pumps will help you save money in the near term and get you the best results from heat pumps later on.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Have a relatively new heating system, but an older (or non-existent) air conditioner? </strong></li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Short answer: Consider a dual fuel system</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Long answer: </strong>If you really need a new air conditioning system but your heater still has a lot of life left in it, consider installing a heat pump to work alongside your existing furnace or boiler. That way, you’ll get efficient cooling capacity that will save you money in the summer, and you’ll also be able to cut down on your fossil fuel consumption in the winter. You can set the heat pump to warm your home until it gets down to a certain temperature outside, at which point your furnace or boiler will kick in. (Many heat pump models can operate in very cold temperatures, so having a backup heating system like this is not necessary, but it may be a good intermediate step in certain cases.)
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Have a furnace or boiler that’s more than 10 years old?</strong></li>
</ul><p>
<strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Short answer: It’s the perfect time to think about heat pumps!</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Long answer: </strong>HVAC equipment typically lasts for 15 to 20 years, so 10 years is probably the earliest you would want to start thinking about a replacement. It’s probably safe to wait a few years longer, but you definitely don’t want to wait until your existing system breaks to start your heat pump journey. A heat pump retrofit can be a months-long process, from finding contractors, to evaluating quotes, to refining your plan, to getting permits and scheduling the work. If you’re in an emergency situation where your boiler broke and you really need heat, you could be forced to settle for a less-than-ideal solution. At the very least, start your research now and consider weatherization upgrades.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Have one room or area of your house that’s particularly hot or cold?</strong></li>
</ul><p>
<strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>Short answer: Get a mini-split!</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Long answer: </strong>Ductless mini-split heat pumps are a no-brainer to provide heating and cooling to a single room or zone. They can be very affordable — and in some cases free — with rebates and tax credits. If you want to retrofit the rest of your home to use heat pumps down the line, this will help you get familiar with the technology and will not preclude you from adding more later — though it is helpful to tell your contractor that now so they can take it into account.

<h4 class="highlight-box-headline" id="weatherizing">A note on insulation and air sealing</h4>
<p>
			No contractor is going to force you to weatherize your home before you get heat pumps, and it is possible to benefit from heat pumps without weatherizing first. But any building expert worth their salt is going to recommend it. “I think it goes somewhat without saying that in an ideal world, everyone would have an updated, weatherized building before they put in a heat pump,” Marin told me. Otherwise, not only will your heat pump have to work harder in the short term, if you do some air sealing or insulation work down the line, then your heat pump will end up being oversized and not run as efficiently as it did.
		</p>
<p>
			“We also live in the real world and know that not everybody has the money and time and willingness to do everything all at once,” Marin says, “and if they're in a position where they are putting in an air conditioner, and now is the time, and they really want a heat pump, we would absolutely support them in doing that, even if they had not weatherized.”
		</p>
<p>
			Want to get started on weatherizing? <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/energy-efficient-renovation" target="_blank">There’s a Heatmap guide for that</a>.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="budget">2. Make a budget</h4><p>
	Heat pumps can be a major investment. If you just want to add heating or cooling capacity to one or two rooms, it can cost $5,000 to $7,000 per room, on average, before incentives, Richardson told me. A whole-home solution averages $20,000 to $30,000 before incentives, but depending on the home and the system design can go much higher.
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="goals">3. Think about your goals</h4><p>
	Do you have some rooms that are hotter in the summer or colder in the winter than others and you want to make your home more comfortable overall? Or is your goal to get better air filtration and ventilation? Or do you simply want to get off fossil fuels? It will be helpful to think through what you want to achieve and communicate that to your contractor so they can take that into account when they design your system.
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="incentives">4. Learn about incentives</h4><p>
	The federal government offers a 
	<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal-tax-credits/air-source-heat-pumps" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>30% tax credit for heat pumps, up to $2,000</u></a>, not including labor, for certain energy efficient models. (Note that you can only get the full tax credit if you have $2,000 or more in tax liability the year you install the heat pumps.) The credit can’t be rolled over to the next tax year, but you <em><em>can</em></em> claim it in multiple years. Your state energy office, city, or utility may offer additional tax credits or rebates.
</p><p>
	It’s important to learn about what’s available in your area before reaching out to contractors because some rebate programs require you to work only with approved partners. Also, the contractors you reach out to might not always be up to date on the latest incentive programs, so it’s a good idea to do some independent research and make sure you find someone who knows how to help you take advantage. There is, unfortunately, not yet any single directory where you can enter your zip code and find out about every possible rebate opportunity everywhere in the country, so it’s best to check multiple sources of information:
</p><ul>
<li>First, check your state energy office’s website. Many states are in the process of revamping or expanding their heat pump rebate programs thanks to new federal funding. </li>
<li>If you live in a major city, check with your city’s energy, sustainability, or buildings department.</li>
<li>The EPA’s Energy Star site has a <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/rebate-finder" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rebate finder</u></a> where you can enter your zip code and learn about state or utility-run incentives. </li>
<li>Also try checking your utility’s website.</li>
<li>Some equipment manufacturers, like <a href="https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Mitsubishi</u></a>, have rebate finders.</li>
<li>Rewiring America has an <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/calculator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>incentive calculator</u></a>.</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">A note on incentives</h4>
<p>
			If you’re counting on subsidies to be able to afford your system, pay close attention to the models your contractor is recommending and make sure they are actually eligible for the subsidies. For example, Waters says that there are very few models of the largest sized heat pumps that are efficient enough to qualify for federal subsidies.
		</p>
<p>
			Richardson warned that some rebate programs incentivize bad design. Xcel, in Colorado, offers more money for bigger systems, encouraging homeowners to oversize their systems. Talk to your contractor about the trade-offs of rebates vs. right-sizing your system.
		</p>
<p>
			Also be aware that in some places, rebates are tied to additional requirements. Massachusetts, for example, offers $10,000 for heat pumps, but they must fully replace the existing heating system and the home must first be weatherized.

<div class="highlight-author">Emily Pontecorvo</div></div></div></div></div><h3 class="rm-anchors" id="contractor">FINDING A CONTRACTOR</h3><p>
	As with all home renovation projects, we strongly recommend getting 
	<u><em><strong><em>at least three</em></strong></em></u><em> </em>quotes from different contractors.
</p><p>
	Heat pumps are common in some parts of the country, but in others it might be difficult to find a contractor who really knows their stuff. Dip your toes in a heat pump Reddit forum and you’ll find scores of homeowners asking what to do after a contractor told them that heat pumps don’t work and they should just stick with gas. 
	<strong>Here are a few strategies for finding high quality heat pump contractors, in order of what we recommend:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li>Do a search for companies in your area who specialize in “building electrification” or “home decarbonization.” There are some HVAC companies, like Waters’, that have made electrification their focus, and they are more likely to be up to date on the latest technologies and training. There are also startups like Elephant whose entire business model is based on helping homeowners manage these projects, and will match you with pre-vetted local contractors.<br/>
</li>
<li>Look at the leading heat pump manufacturers’ directories of approved contractors. For example, Mitsubishi’s <a href="https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/request-a-quote?find-contractors-tab=1" target="_blank"><u>directory of “independent Diamond contractors”</u></a> are HVAC pros that have received extensive training on the equipment and working with someone in this network can extend your equipment warranty. (Other leading brands of inverter-based systems include Daikin and Fujitsu.)<br/>
</li>
<li>Do you know any friends, family, or neighbors that have heat pumps? Ask them if they were happy with their experience. Which companies did they talk to? Who did they decide to work with and why? If you don’t know anyone who has done a heat pump retrofit, look for electrification Facebook groups or heat pump Reddit threads, where participants may have recommendations for your area.</li>
<li>The Building Performance Institute is an accreditation group that certifies companies, energy auditors, and technicians in the latest building science. You can search for certified professionals in your area using <a href="https://locate.bpi.org/?type=1" target="_blank"><u>BPI’s online directory</u></a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>Check if your state energy office or utility has an online directory of heat pump installers. Many rebate programs also require you to work with approved partner contractors.</li>
<li>Try using <a href="https://www.energysage.com/shop/heat-pumps/" target="_blank"><u>EnergySage</u></a>, which will have you enter your address and then source quotes for you from installers that serve your area. (Note: This service is not available everywhere.)</li>
</ul><h3>How to Vet Contractors </h3><p>
	Finding the right contractor is probably the most important decision you’ll make in this entire process, and it’s not uncommon to get quotes with wildly different recommendations. Here are some questions you can ask to help you get a sense of who really knows what they are talking about and is willing to go the whole nine yards to make sure you get a properly designed system:
</p><h4>1. Will you do a “Manual J” load calculation to determine how much air and energy I need in each room?</h4><p>
	Manual J is a formula that helps a contractor identify the right size HVAC system for your home. It requires taking detailed measurements throughout the building, inspecting your home’s insulation and other elements that will affect airflow and heat retention, and performing tests such as the “blower door” to assess how leaky your building’s envelope is. If you’re interested in using your ductwork or installing new ductwork, they should also perform a “Manual D” calculation. Waters told me that despite these calculations being industry standards, very few contractors actually go through the trouble of doing them. “What this does, it tells us exactly what size system I need for heating and cooling, and exactly how much air goes into each room,” he said.
</p><p>
	Richards agreed, adding that you may want to ask what technology they use to size the system. “You need somebody who has a technology-driven tool that can actually measure the heating and cooling requirements of your home,” he says. “Are you doing a true Manual J, or are you sort of sticking your finger up in the air?”
</p><h4>2. Do you install more than one brand of heat pump? How many heat pump installations have you done?</h4><p>
	If your contractor only works with one brand of equipment, you’re more likely to get a solution that’s convenient for them rather than one that’s custom designed for you.
</p><h4>3. Will you take a comprehensive look at my ductwork? Do you recommend new registers?</h4><p>
	Waters told me the registers — the vents that release air into a given room — are critical for occupant comfort. If your existing ductwork is designed to distribute air from a furnace, your registers may be designed to push air into the middle of the room. But with heat pumps, you want the air either pushed up toward the ceiling if the vents are down low or across the ceiling if they are up high, so that the house doesn’t feel drafty and you get proper circulation.
</p><h4>4. Will you evaluate my electrical system for my home’s future electrification needs?</h4><p>
	If you’re starting with heat pumps but you eventually want to electrify your stove, your clothes dryer, or your car, your home may need an electric panel upgrade or an electric service upgrade from the utility. What you don’t want is to put in heat pumps that eat up the rest of your home’s capacity and then have to deal with pricey upgrades down the line.
</p><h4>5. Are you BPI and/or NATE certified?</h4><p>
	The Building Performance Institute and North American Technician Excellence are two organizations that train and certify contractors, auditors, and technicians in the latest building science and best practices. A certification doesn’t guarantee you’ve found the right contractor — it could mean they know a lot about installing heat pumps but still don’t know much about the models that work in the coldest climates, for instance. But it’s a helpful data point that shows they are investing in training.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline" id="trade-offs">A note on comparing quotes</h4>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>There’s usually going to be an option that costs you the least up front, and one that will cost you the least to operate, and those are not going to use the same equipment, said Waters. He recommends spending a little bit more up front to get a system that will use less energy, but you’ll have to choose what’s right for you.<br/>
</li>
<li>Unlike with solar panels, calculating a “payback period” for a heat pump retrofit is not really a thing. Some contractors may be able to help you estimate your future utility bills, and there are calculators online that can give you a rough idea. But there are so many factors that can influence the outcome, said Marin, that these tools are not very accurate.</li>
<li>Pay close attention to warranties. Contractors may offer different lengths of equipment warranty and labor warranty.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="next">WHAT’S NEXT?</h2><p>
	After you’ve found a contractor or company to work with, settled on a system design, and secured financing, your installer is going to need to secure permits for the work. Then you’ll need to schedule the installation, which, depending on how busy your contractor is, can take several weeks to several months. The actual work should take one to three days, depending on how complicated it is.
</p><p>
	Also — talk to your contractor about maintenance. Be sure to clean the filters regularly and do anything else they recommend to get the best performance and longest life out of your equipment.

## Which Induction Stove Is Right for You?

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0MjcyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDY2MDM0MH0.Nz28oXGVitJC6-9Z8bs4Ocw1duCptZLT8Qvsp3M6RmQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=400%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Have you given much thought to the inner workings of your stove? Me neither. Your home probably came with one already installed, and so long as you can turn it on, boil some water and simmer up a sauce, perhaps that’s reason enough not to second guess it.
	<br/>
</p><p>
	But if you’re cooking with gas, we’re here to let you know that, culinary connoisseur or not, there are undeniable benefits to switching to either electric or induction cooking. First and foremost, neither relies directly on fossil fuels or emits harmful pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide into your home, making the switch integral to any effort to decarbonize your life — not to mention establish a comfortable living environment. Second, both electric and induction are far more energy efficient than gas.
</p><p>
	“So on a gas range, about 70% of the heat that is generated from the gas goes into your kitchen,” DR Richardson, co-founder of the home electrification platform Elephant Energy, told me. “So it's very inefficient. You get hot. The handle gets hot. The kitchen gets hot. Everything gets hot, except your food. And it takes a really long time.” With an electric or induction stove, you can boil water faster and heat your food up quicker, all while reducing your home’s carbon footprint.
</p><p>
	Convinced yet? If you’re reading this guide, we sure hope you’re at least intrigued! But even after you’ve decided to make the switch, confusion and analysis paralysis can still loom. Are your needs better suited to electric or induction? Will expensive electrical upgrades be required? How will this impact your cooking? And where are all the stove stores, anyway? So before you start browsing the aisles and showrooms, let’s get up to speed on all things stoves… or is it ranges? You’ll see.
</p><h2>THE EXPERT PANEL</h2><p>
<em><strong><em>Friday Apaliski </em></strong></em><em>is the director of communications at the Building Decarbonization Coalition, a nonprofit composed of members across various sectors including environmental justice groups, energy providers, and equipment manufacturers, seeking alignment on a path towards the elimination of fossil fuels in buildings.</em>
</p><p>
<em><strong><em>DR Richardson </em></strong></em><em>is a co-founder of Elephant Energy, a platform that aims to simplify residential electrification for both homeowners and contractors. The company provides personalized electrification roadmaps and handles the entire installation process, including helping homeowners take advantage of all the available local, state, and federal incentives.</em>
</p><h2>OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS</h2><ul>
<li><a href="#current">Familiarize yourself</a> with your existing range or cooktop — is it all gas, all electric, or a dual fuel range?<br/>
</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="#incentives">federal, state, and local incentives</a> for electric and induction stoves and cooktops, and from here, determine whether electric or induction would best fit your needs and budget.</li>
<li>Explore <a href="#brands">different brands and models</a> online and in person at showrooms and big box retailers.</li>
<li>If you’re moving from an all gas range to an electric or induction range, <a href="#contractor">find a plumber</a> to cap your gas line and an electrician to install an <a href="#electric">electrical circuit</a> for your new stove. If you already have a dual-fuel or electric range, this won’t be necessary.</li>
<li>Get stove <a href="#next">installed</a>, and cook your heart out!</li>
</ul><h2>THE BASICS</h2><ul>
<li>It’s common to use the terms <strong>stove</strong> and <strong>range </strong>interchangeably to refer to the common boxy appliance we’re all used to — one that combines a <strong>stovetop</strong> with burners above and an <strong>oven</strong> below. Some consider range to be the more accurate term for this two-in-one appliance, as a stove could simply refer to the burners up top. In this guide, we’ll use the terms stove and range to mean the complete appliance, and the terms <strong>stovetop </strong>or <strong>cooktop</strong> to refer to either just the top of a range/stove or a standalone device in which the burners are integrated into a countertop with no oven.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>One of the main distinctions you’ll hear about is <strong>electric stoves</strong> vs. <strong>induction stoves. </strong>The terms can be misleading, as both run on electricity, but heat up in very different ways. <strong>Electric stoves </strong>send electricity through a resistive coil that radiates heat out to your cookware, and thereby into your food. <strong>Induction stoves</strong>, on the other hand, use copper coils to create a magnetic field that produces an electric current in the metal of the cookware itself, thus generating the heat needed to boil water, saute veggies, or set an omelet. </li>

<li>Some homes have what’s known as a <strong>dual fuel range</strong>, which combines a gas stovetop with an electric oven in one unit. If you have a dual fuel range, you won’t need to make the same type of electrical upgrades as those with ranges that run fully on gas.</li>
</ul><h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. If I get an induction stove, will I have to get all new cookware?</h4><p>
	It depends on the cookware you currently own, but you will almost certainly need to replace some items. Induction stoves work with pots and pans that are made of magnetic materials like cast iron and stainless steel, but not those made of glass, aluminum, or copper. You can check to see if your cookware is induction compatible by seeing if a magnet will stick to the bottom, or if the induction logo is present on the bottom.
</p><h4>2. I take my cooking seriously. Will I get the same results on induction?</h4><p>
	Everyone has their own affinities, but what we can tell you is that both traditional electric stoves and newer induction stoves are more energy efficient than gas stoves, and when it comes to temperature control, induction stoves are the clear winner. They allow you to make near instantaneous heat adjustments with great precision, while gas stoves take longer to adjust and are less exact to begin with.
</p><p>
	Cooking on a new stove will undoubtedly come with a learning curve, what with all the new knobs and buttons and little sounds to get used to. Many cooks are used to relying on the visual cue of the flame to let them know how hot the stove is, but now you’ll be relying on a number on the screen, instead. Especially if you go with induction stove, be assured that you’ll be in good company

</p><h4>3. Will I have to replace all my wiring to accommodate an induction stove?</h4><p>
	This is indeed a key question — more on this one below.
</p><h2>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED</h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="current">1. Figure out the type of range or cooktop you currently have</h4><p>
	If you don’t know already, it’s not too hard to find out. When you turn on the stovetop, is there fire? That, folks, is a gas stovetop. It will have a gas supply line that looks like a threaded pipe that connects to the back of the appliance. Gas stovetops are tricky to clean, not particularly sleek, and 
	<a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/state/pdf/State%20Appliances.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most prevalent</u></a> in California, New Jersey, Illinois, Washington DC, New York, and Nevada.
</p><p>
	If you have an electric range, the stovetop will be flat with metal coils either exposed or concealed beneath a ceramic glass surface. The coils will glow bright when they’re on. Electric ranges plug directly into 
	<a href="https://fredsappliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/outletsdryer-1.jpg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>240-volt outlets</u></a> (newer versions have four prongs, older ones have three), with a <a href="https://fredsappliance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/8171394RC.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cord</u></a> that looks like a heavy vacuum plug or a small hose. Electric stovetops are always paired with electric ovens — this is the setup that the majority of Americans already have <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=53439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to the Energy Information Administration</u></a>.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“So if you have an electric range and you like it, that's wonderful. You should keep it. But generally, when we're talking about transitioning from a gas experience to something else, induction is a much more analogous cooking experience,” Apaliski said.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	If you have an induction range, it was probably a very intentional choice! According to a 
	<a href="https://article.images.consumerreports.org/prod/content/dam/surveys/Consumer_Reports_AES_June_2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2022 Consumer Reports survey</u></a>, only about 3% of Americans have an induction range or cooktop, so big ups if you’re a part of that energy efficient minority. But if you just wandered into a new home and are wondering if it’s got the goods, you might have to turn on the stove to tell. Unlike an electric stovetop, you won’t see the cooking area glow because the surface isn’t actually getting hot, only the cookware is. Induction stoves also plug directly into 240-volt outlets.
</p><p>
	But wait! There’s a chance you’re cooking with both gas and electric on a dual-fuel range. The telltale sign will be if your range connects to both a gas supply line as well as a 240-volt outlet (remember that plug?). But if it’s difficult to determine what’s going on back there, here’s what else to look out for: A 
	<a href="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1368435054/photo/looking-inside-the-black-empty-kitchen-oven-there-is-a-lattice-shelf-and-a-red-hot-heating.jpg?s=1024x1024&w=is&k=20&c=JEa8yEcrFD6KvrFQfNFWv2F6CzCqRTLfCu5Oitn5ka8=" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>metal device</u></a> at the bottom and/or top of the oven’s interior that glows bright when the oven is on indicates that it’s electric! Sometimes these heating elements will be concealed, though. In that case, look for telltale signs of gas: An open flame when the oven is on or a visible pilot light when off. Newer gas stoves might not have either, but rather use an electronic ignition system that you can hear fire up about 30-45 seconds after turning on the oven. If you’re still confused, there’s always your user manual! (You kept that, right?)
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Take note of your range’s current location.</h4>
<p>
			If you’re going from an all-gas range to electric or induction and your stove is located on a kitchen island, for example, this could make installing the necessary electrical wiring more complex. It’s something to ask potential contractors about when you get to that stage.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="electric">2. Figure out the size of your electric panel</h4><p>
	Whenever you add a new electric appliance to your home, there’s the possibility that you’ll need to upgrade your electric panel to accommodate the new load. A new panel can cost thousands of dollars, though, so you’ll want to know ahead of time if this might be necessary. First, check the 
	<a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/articles/electrical-panel/how-to-determine-home-electrical-panel-size" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>size of your current electric panel</u>. You </a>can find this information on your main breaker or fuse, a label on the panel itself, or your electric meter.
</p><p>
<a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/articles/electrical-panel/electrical-panel-upgrade-pros-cons" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According to Rewiring America</u></a>, if your panel is less than 100 amps, an upgrade could be necessary. If it’s anywhere from 100 to 150 amps, you can likely electrify everything in your home — including your range — without a panel upgrade, although some creative planning might be needed (more on that <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/articles/electrical-panel/how-to-electrify-home-100-amp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a> and below, in the section on finding contractors and installers). If your panel is greater than 150 amps, it’s very likely that you can get an electric range (as well as a bevy of other electrical appliances) without upgrading.
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="incentives">3. Learn about incentives</h4><p>
	As of now, federal incentives for electric and induction ranges, cooktops, and ovens are not yet available. But 
	<a href="https://www.energy.gov/scep/home-electrification-and-appliance-rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Home Electrification and Appliance Rebates</u></a> programs, established via the Inflation Reduction Act, will roll out on a state-by-state basis over the course of this year and next, with most programs expected to come online in 2025. These rebates could give low- and moderate-income houses up to $840 back on the cost of switching from gas to electric or induction cooking.
</p><p>
	While many details have yet to be released, it’s important to note that qualifying customers won’t be required to pay the full price and 
	<em><em>then </em></em>apply for reimbursement — rather, the discount will be applied upfront. Once the program becomes available, your state will have a website with more information on how to apply. If you’re cash-strapped today, it could be worth waiting until the federal incentives roll out, as <strong>rebates will not be retroactively available.</strong>
</p><p>
	Many states and municipalities already have their own incentives for electric appliance upgrades though. Unfortunately, there’s currently no centralized database to look these up, so that means doing a little homework. Check with your local utility, as well as your local and state government websites and energy offices for home electrification incentives. If you happen to live in California or Washington state, you can 
	<a href="https://incentives.switchison.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>search for local incentives here</u></a>, via this initiative from the Building Decarbonization Coalition. <a href="https://www.nodecollective.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The NODE Collective</u></a> is also working to compile data on all residential incentive programs, so keep checking in, more information is coming soon!
</p><h4>4. Compare electric vs. induction</h4><p>
	Assuming you currently have a gas stove or a dual fuel range, this is the first big choice you’ll have to make. For customers interested in upgrading from electric to induction, let this also be your guide, as an induction stove is indeed the higher-end choice. Here are the main differences between the two:
</p><p>
<strong>Electric</strong>
</p><ul>
<strong>Cost*:</strong> $700+ on average
	<li><strong>Efficiency**:</strong> 74%, still far superior to a gas stove’s 40% efficiency rate</li>
<li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> Less precise. This likely won’t affect the average cook much, but for those seeking perfection, induction definitely outperforms here.</li>
<li><strong>Cookware:</strong> Will work with all of your existing cookware!</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>
	Induction
	</strong>
</p><ul>
<strong>Cost*:</strong> $1,300+ on average
	<li><strong>Efficiency**:</strong> 90% — Induction is far and away the fastest way to cook</li>
<li><strong>Temperature control:</strong> Excellent. Because induction stoves provide direct heat, more precise and quick temperature adjustments are possible. Some induction cooktops even allow you to set an exact temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Cookware:</strong> Works only with specific cookware made of magnetic materials, such as stainless steel and cast iron, but not glass, aluminum, or copper.</li>
</ul><p>
<em>*<a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/projects/cooking-homeowner" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>According to Rewiring America</u></a></em>
</p><p>
<em>** According to 
	<a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>this paper</u></a></em>
</p><p>
<strong>Heatmap Recommends: </strong>Spring for the induction stove if you can. Not only will it provide a superior cooking experience, but it’s safer too. Induction stoves <em><em>only</em></em> heat up magnetic pots and pans, so if you touch the stove’s surface, you won’t get burned. Most will also turn off automatically if there’s no cookware detected.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“Induction is definitely the upgrade in basically every sense, if you can afford it. Induction is a way better cooking experience. It's got way more fun heating and cooking control. It's much more energy efficient. It's much faster,” said Richardson.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	If you’re curious about what it’s like to cook with an electric or induction stove, you can buy a standalone single-pot cooktop for well under $100; it will plug straight into a standard outlet. Additionally, Apalinksi says that many libraries (yes, libraries!) and utilities allow residents to borrow an induction cooktop and try it out for a few weeks, completely free of charge.
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="brands">5. Explore different brands and models</h4><p>
	New electric and induction ranges and cooktops will only be eligible for forthcoming federal incentives if they’re certified by Energy Star, a joint program run by the Environmental Protection Agency and the DOE that provides consumer information on energy efficient products, practices, and standards. You can check out what 
	<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-residential-electric-cooking-products/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>models of ranges and cooktops</u></a> qualify here. But to get a handle on the actual look and feel of various options, you should try and find a showroom or head to a large retail store.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“Go to your local big box retailer, whether it's a Home Depot or Best Buy or Lowe's, they tend to have a bunch of models on the floor. Their representatives can talk to you about all the different options out there. But you have to research a little bit ahead of time, otherwise they're going to point you to the latest gas appliance,” said Richardson.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	If you learn that making the switch is going to entail particularly cumbersome electrical upgrades, Apaliski said there are some innovative companies such as 
	<a href="https://copperhome.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>Channing Street Copper</strong></u></a> and<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.impulselabs.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgClvlub5uE89v81Z_AYYTBWQsuC1xQVNOXN-hOny-GW0pnn8mRnNBorBoC7aQQAvD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Impulse Labs</strong></a> that make induction ranges and cooktops that plug into standard outlets. They’re much pricier than your standard range, but if you can afford it, one could be right if you’re looking for plug-and-play simplicity and sleek design.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“So this is great, for example, if you are a renter, or if you are someone who has limited capacity on your electrical panel, or if you are someone who has one of these kitchen islands that is just impossible to get a new electric cord to,” Apaliski said.</strong></em></em>

	If you buy your new range or cooktop from a big box retailer, they’ll typically haul away your old appliance and deliver and install the new one for you at either low or no cost. Don’t assume this is a part of the package, though, and be sure to ask what is and isn’t included before you make your purchase.
</p><p>
	But if you’re moving from an all gas range or cooktop to an electric or induction range or cooktop, the complicated part isn’t the installation process, it’s everything that must come before. That includes capping and sealing the gas line for your old stove (this is a job for a plumber) and installing the requisite electric wiring to power your new stove (this is a job for an electrician).
</p><p>
	As noted, making the switch could also mean a costly electric panel upgrade. You should ask potential electricians about this right away, as well as about creative solutions that would let you work with your existing panel. If you’re running out of space, you could buy a circuit sharing device like a smart splitter or a circuit pauser, which would allow multiple loads, such as an EV charger and your stove, to share a circuit, or ensure that specific appliances are shut off when you’re approaching your panel’s limit. Richardson recommends getting opinions from a couple different electricians, seconding the idea that if your panel is 100 amps or more, an upgrade is likely not necessary.
</p><p>
	Above all, you should make sure that the gas line and electric work is taken care of 
	<em><em>before</em></em> the stove installer comes to your home. Richardson said that occasionally, retailers will provide plumbing and electrical services as an add-on option, so it never hurts to ask. But most likely you’ll be sourcing contractors and compiling quotes on your own. If you don’t already have a go to person for the job, ask friends, family, and neighbors for references. Google and Yelp reviews are always there too.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Note</h4>
<p>
			New electric ranges do not usually come with a power cord. You must purchase your own power cord prior to installation.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4>Things to ask potential plumbers and electricians: </h4><ul><li><strong>Are you licensed and insured for this type of work?</strong> Asking for proof is always a good idea!<br/></li><li><strong>How long will this work take, and when would you be able to start? </strong>You’ll likely want to align the scheduling of the gas work, the electrical work, and the installation of your new appliance, so that you don’t go too long without a working stove! While these things can’t happen simultaneously, scheduling them close together makes sense.<br/></li><li><strong>What is your expected work schedule, and can I (or should I) stay in my home during the process?</strong> You’ll want to know when the contractors plan to arrive, and if the work is going to cause any disruptions, such as a power shut off. You should also ask if they recommend you stick around, in case any questions arise.<br/></li><li><strong>What type of warranty do you offer for your work?</strong> This ensures that if any of the work is performed incorrectly, it will be fixed free of charge. Your range or cooktop will have its own separate warranty, which you should also be aware of.<br/></li><li><strong>Will you work with subcontractors?</strong> Clarify who is your point of contact for the project, and make sure the contractor’s insurance covers subcontractors as well.<br/></li><li><strong>Will this work require a permit? If so, who will be in charge of securing that? </strong>This will depend on where you live and the scope of the work. Ensuring that your contractor understands the nuances of local regulations and permitting processes is key.<br/></li><li><strong>What is your payment schedule?</strong> You may be expected to pay a plumber or electrician an upfront deposit, depending on the complexity of the project.<br/></li><li><strong>Will you conduct a site visit in order to get a more accurate cost and scope of work estimate?</strong> This can help everyone get on the same page about how much work the job will entail, to ensure that you get an accurate quote. Ask whether the site visit will be free or if there’s a consultation fee.<br/></li><li><strong>What technologies would allow me to keep my existing electric panel? </strong>As mentioned, there are numerous ways to avoid panel upgrades. If your current panel can’t easily handle the new load, discuss alternate options with your electrician.</li></ul><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="next">WHAT’S NEXT?</h2><p>
	Once you get time on the calendar with a trustworthy, knowledgeable and fair-priced plumber and electrician, it’s time to schedule the installation of your new range or cooktop. And after 
	<em><em>that</em></em> it’s time to metaphorically fire up those resistive coils or electromagnetic fields and make yourself an electrified meal for the ages.

## It Might Be Time to Replace Your Water Heater

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NDkwNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyOTk1Njc4MX0.CKN7DWBNaxw7zj7DYJnsjnmqPj-gGNQzNFGc8I8-sDg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=400%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The humble water heater, like your fridge or septic tank, is the type of home technology that you only notice if and when it breaks. For most homeowners, that’s every 13 years. But if you’re on a mission to decarbonize your life, you might want to rethink your current set-up, and perhaps consider a makeover. Per the Department of Energy, water heating accounts for roughly 18% of the average household’s energy use, making it the second largest energy expense in any home.
	<br/>
</p><p>
	Back in April, the DOE released new residential water heater standards that it says will save American households approximately $7.6 billion per year on their energy bills “while significantly cutting energy waste and harmful carbon pollution.” The standards will also, in effect, phase out electric resistance water heaters, which currently account for half the U.S. market, in favor of more energy-efficient heat pump water heaters by 2029. If any of that confuses you, read on. We’re breaking down everything you need to know about this oft-forgotten, basement-dwelling home technology, from the taxonomy of water heater types to tax credit and rebate tips to product recommendations.
</p><h2>THE EXPERT PANEL</h2><p>
<em><strong>Andy Meyer </strong>is a senior program manager at Efficiency Maine, an independent agency that implements energy efficiency programs in the state. His team is responsible for providing resources on heat pump water heaters to Maine residents, who buy one out of every 10 purchased in the U.S. </em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Ben Foster </strong>is vice president of operations at Barnett Plumbing & Water Heaters, a leading heat pump water heater contractor in California. He’s also developed loaner water heater programs supported by TECH Clean California, and notes that most contractors don’t have access to loaner programs: </em>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Joseph Wachunas </strong>is a senior project manager at the New Buildings Institute, a nonprofit working to reduce emissions and deliver climate solutions through the built environment. At NBI, he heads up the Advanced Water Heating Initiative, which aims to decarbonize water heating through heat pump water heaters.</em>
</p><h2>OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS</h2><ul>
<li>Understand the differences between <a href="#types">water heater types</a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>Take stock of your home’s <a href="#size">specific considerations</a> and <a href="#household">water needs</a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>Check your <a href="#wiring">electrical system</a> and research your <a href="#options">options</a>, including their associated <a href="#risk">risks</a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>Determine what size water heater you’ll <a href="#recommends">need</a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>Find a trustworthy contractor or <a href="#contractor">prepare to DIY</a>.</li>
</ul><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="types">THE BASICS</h2><ul>
<li>The first step to switching your water heater is understanding the<strong> Uniform Energy Factor. </strong>This is the rating that determines a water heater’s efficiency, i.e. how much energy it uses to heat water versus how much it loses in the process. While there is no “ideal” UEF, a good rule of thumb is the higher the UEF, the more efficient the water heater<em><em>. </em></em></li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Most <strong>conventional water heaters </strong>are spectacularly inefficient. They work by<strong> </strong>heating a storage tank of water either by electric resistance (i.e. the same technology that powers a toaster) or natural gas. The UEF on conventional water heaters is generally around 0.6. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Tankless water heaters </strong>heat water directly, without a storage tank. The power source — either an electric element or gas burner — warms cold water as it travels through a heat exchanger in the unit. Like conventional water heaters, tankless water heaters can be powered by either electric resistance or gas, and only heat water when the user needs it. The UEF on tankless water heaters is typically around 0.8.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Heat pump water heaters </strong>and<strong> hybrid water heaters</strong>, meanwhile,<strong> </strong>work by gathering heat from the surrounding air — the classic comparison is to an air conditioner, but in reverse. Most heat pump water heaters also have a back-up electric-resistance mechanism that kicks in during periods of high demand (thus, hybrid). The UEF on heat pump water heaters is between 3 and 4, a gobsmacking five times more efficient than conventional and tankless water heaters, which is instead of quickly creating heat, they slowly move it around. Heat pump water heaters are by far the most energy efficient water heaters on the market<em><em>.</em></em></li>
</ul><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“Heat pump water heaters are simple to install — any plumber or handy person can do it — but plumbers may not be familiar with them. So if you talk with a plumber who has concerns, consider calling another plumber,” Meyer told me. “Again, Mainers have installed over 70,000 in the last 12 years. They are no longer new.”</strong> </em></em>
</blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>Solar water heaters </strong>use the sun’s energy to heat up water in a storage tank, and are either active or passive — active solar water heaters use circulating pumps, while passive heaters allow natural convection to move water from the collectors to the storage tank as it heats up. Solar water heaters have a different efficiency standard, the solar energy factor, which is the energy delivered by the system divided by the electrical or gas energy put into the system. The SEF of most solar water heaters is somewhere from 2 to 3, and these water heaters generally only work in areas where temperatures rarely fall below freezing.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The last type of water heater to keep in mind is <strong>indirect water heaters </strong>or<strong> tankless coil water heaters</strong>, which use a home’s space heating system to heat water; indirect water heaters then store that in a tank, whereas tankless coil water heaters work on demand. These water heaters are generally only efficient during cold months or in cold climates, when houses’ heating systems are on regularly — and even then, tankless coil water heaters are notoriously inefficient.</li>
</ul><h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. How does a heat pump water heater work?</h4><p>
	A heat pump water heater is made up of a compressor, storage tank, condenser, evaporator coil, fan, backup heating elements, and refrigerant. The compressor, located in the upper compartment of the water heater, uses refrigerant to heat the water in the storage tank (via the condenser, which acts as a heat exchanger). The evaporator coil and fan work to change refrigerant from liquid back to gas after the water has been heated. The backup electric heating elements kick in only in periods of high demand to ensure consistent hot water supply.
</p><h4>2. It gets cold where I live. Can I still get a heat pump water heater?</h4><p>
	A common misconception about heat pumps in general is that they don’t work in colder climates. This is not at all the case — half of electric water heaters in Maine, for instance, are now heat pumps. As long as they are installed indoors and in an area where pipes won’t freeze (typically, a basement), heat pump water heaters work throughout the year in all climates, according to Meyer and Wachunas. The rule of thumb, per the DOE, is to install your heat pump water heater in locations that remain in the 40 degree to 90 degree Fahrenheit range year-round.
</p><h4>3. How much can I save with a heat pump water heater?</h4><p>
	Per the DOE, replacing your standard electric water heater with a heat pump water heater can save you <a href="https://hotwatersolutionsnw.org/" target="_blank">up to 10%</a> on your electricity bill, reducing your water heating energy consumption and costs by up to 70%.
</p><h2>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED</h2><p>
	The 
	<em><em>number one mistake</em></em> homeowners make when it comes to their water heaters is waiting until they’re broken to replace them. This severely limits your options for new water heaters — as Foster notes, no one “wants to go days without hot water, let alone weeks,” and it can take weeks or even months to fit your home for a heat pump water heater. (We’ll get into why a bit later.)
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“A lot of contractors, if you want a heat pump and you have a leaking water heater that needs to be replaced today, they're just going to convince you to go with gas,” Foster said.</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	Some contractors have loaner water heater programs, so you can temporarily use a gas heater in an emergency situation, but these programs are few and far between. If you’ve had your water heater for 10 years or more — even if it’s working just fine — it might be time to think about replacing it. If you do, you’ll need to consider a few things about your home and lifestyle, especially if you’re considering a heat pump water heater:
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="size">1. The size and layout of your house</h4><p>
	Heat pump water heaters require a significant amount of space. Per Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, heat pump water heaters can require more than 6 feet of height clearance to account for their air filters, as well as a 3-foot diameter space to provide clearance for the drain pan and other connections. Additionally, the heat pump water heater should be positioned so the exhaust outlet is at least 8 inches away from a wall, door, or ceiling.
</p><p>
	Also, since heat pump water heaters work by drawing heat from the surrounding air, they require 700 cubic feet of unenclosed space surrounding the water heater location. While it is possible to install a heat pump water heater in a location with insufficient air volume (for instance, by installing the water heater with a door equipped with top and bottom grills), this would require extra work from your contractor. Taking all these measurements into account, this basically means that a heat pump water heater requires a 
	<em><em>10-foot by 9-foot room with an 8-foot-tall ceiling. </em></em>
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Note</h4>
<p>
			Heat pump water heaters are not silent! Their compressors produce sounds similar to a dishwasher or dehumidifier when operating. Be mindful of this when choosing where to install your water heater.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4>2. Maintenance requirements of a heat pump water heater</h4><p>
	Heat pump water heaters also require monthly and yearly service, Meyer told me. You should change the water filter every two to six months, and clear the condensate lines to ensure your unit doesn’t get clogged with mold or bacteria. Additionally, if your unit is a hybrid, you’ll have to keep an eye on its anode rod, which can become corroded over time and lead to heating issues. You’ll have to flush your heat pump water heater annually to avoid corrosion.
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="household">3. Your household’s size and water needs</h4><p>If you’re going to DIY it, understanding your household’s water needs is key to sizing and installing a new heat pump water heater. First, determine your house’s peak hour demand (the maximum amount of water your house uses in one hour per day) using 
	<a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/sizing-new-water-heater#storage" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>this worksheet</u></a> from the DOE. You can then use that number (measured in gallons) to determine what size heat water heater to buy — look at the heater’s first hour rating, a.k.a. the amount of hot water the heater can supply per hour, starting with a tank full of hot water. You’ll want your heater’s first hour rating to be equal to (or ideally, higher than) your peak hour demand.
</p><p>
	Though you should use the worksheet to determine your unique peak hour demand, a general rule is that households of one to two people should use a 50-gallon water heater, while households of three or more people should use a 65- to 80-gallon tank. The average family uses 50 gallons of hot water per day, Wachunas explained. “So even if you have lots of showers in the morning, your heat pump in two to four hours will heat that water back up and you have plenty of extra supply.”
</p><p>
	If you’re between two sizes of heat pump water heaters, always upsize, Foster said. This ensures that the heat pump is the primary source of heat, as opposed to the much less efficient backup electric mechanisms. In other words, it’s far more efficient (and less expensive!) for a larger heat pump water heater to heat a few extra gallons of water using the heat pump than it is for a smaller heat pump water heater to have to use its electric elements to keep up with excess demand.
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="wiring">4. Your existing wiring</h4><p>
	Since many heat pump water heaters have certain voltage requirements, you may have to upgrade your electrical panel for 240-volt hardwired service. The cost and time involved in having your service upgraded can vary and depends on whether the power lines coming into your house are above ground. If they’re underground, Foster explained, a contractor will have to excavate and run new cables, which can take over a year. The best way to determine if you’ll need to upgrade your service is to have a trusted contractor do an assessment on your home. (This is also why it’s essential to plan in advance.)
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Note</h4>
<p>
			You can circumvent those upfront electrical costs by using 
			<strong>new, lower voltage heat pump water heaters</strong>, which first hit the market in July 2022. Wachunas recommends using the <a href="https://www.redwoodenergy.net/watt-diet-calculator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Watt Diet calculator</a> to determine how many amps of electricity your home actually needs. He was able to fully electrify his family’s duplex using a 120-volt model, which plugs into a standard outlet. While these 120-volt heaters are not cheaper than the higher voltage models, their easy installation requirements can help you avoid electrical upgrade costs.
		</p>
<p>
	It’s important to note, however, that 
			<strong>the electric resistance backup mechanism on these units is much smaller</strong> than standard hybrid water heaters. That means they have a more limited hot water output compared to the 240-volt models, which can lead to wait times during periods of high demand. It can also take longer to heat water to the desired temperature. Generally, the 120-volt models work best for smaller households with moderate hot water needs.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4>5. Location, location, location</h4><p>
	Basements are always the best places for heat pump water heaters, regardless of climate. Other common locations for installation include garages, interior rooms, and rooms outside the thermal envelope, like attached sheds and utility rooms. The garage does not have to be insulated if outdoor temperatures are usually above 50°F, but if temperatures dip below freezing and the garage is uninsulated, it’d be best to consider another location. Interior rooms, like laundry or IT rooms, are a great choice because a heat pump water heater can utilize any waste heat generated by the equipment in the room. Finally, rooms outside the thermal envelope, like attached sheds, can be even more efficient than interior spaces in hot or warm climates because of the excess hot air.

	Feeling ready to go shopping? Here’s everything you need to know about the buying and installation process.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>There are plenty of tax credits and rebates to take advantage of.</strong> The big one to note is the 30% tax credit from the federal government (thank you, Inflation Reduction Act!) for heat pump water heaters, which covers both the unit and installation, up to $2,000. You can read up on that program <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/about/federal-tax-credits/heat-pump-water-heaters" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>. You can also use the Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency to research utility rebates <a href="https://www.dsireusa.org/" target="_blank"><u>specific to your region</u></a>. Also be sure to check out Energy Star’s <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/rebate-finder" target="_blank"><u>rebate finder</u></a> and Rewiring America’s <a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/electric-tax-credits" target="_blank"><u>tax credit guide</u></a>. (Rewiring America, as it happens, is also a sponsor of Decarbonize Your Life.) A heat pump water heater typically costs about $1,000 more than other types of electric water heaters before rebates and tax credits, but once you factor those in, you may find you have more budget to work with than you thought. It’ll also save you about $500 per year on your utility bills, according to Meyer, so “payback is quick.”<br/>
</li>
<li class="rm-anchors" id="contractor"><strong>Decide whether you want to hire a contractor or install the new heater yourself.</strong> Though a DIY water heater install sounds intimidating, it’s “surprisingly accessible for folks if you're semi-handy,” Wachunas told me. Efficiency Maine estimates that a third of its customers install heat pump water heaters themselves. Unlike HVAC heat pumps, heat pump water heaters are closed systems, so they come sealed in one packed unit that the customer simply has to install as they would any other electric water heater. (This also means that if and when the thing breaks — most heat pump water heaters have 10-year warranties — the whole unit has to be replaced, not just a part.)</li>
<li><strong>If you’re DIY-ing it, you can buy a heat pump water heater either online or at a local hardware or home improvement store.</strong> It’s important to keep in mind, however, that these units are quite heavy and cannot be taken apart. Depending on capacity, they can be over 300 pounds — so prepare accordingly to transport the unit to your house. As for installing, first, you’ll have to remove your existing water heater (this will involve draining the tank, removing supply lines, and disconnecting the power). Next, you’ll clean up your workspace and prepare your new plumbing material. Then you’ll position your new water heater, connect your supply lines to the new heater, fill the tank with cold water, and connect the heater to the electrical supply according to the manufacturer’s instructions. <em><em>Voilà!</em></em> Your heat pump water heater is ready for use. Check out <a href="https://hotwatersolutionsnw.org/diy/" target="_blank"><u>this guide</u></a> from Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance. PNNL also has a great <a href="https://basc.pnnl.gov/hpwh_installation_tool" target="_blank"><u>heat pump water heater installation tool</u></a> that can walk you through the selection and installation process.</li>
<li><strong>If DIY isn’t your bag, it’s essential to find the right contractor, as not all water heater contractors are familiar with heat pump water heater models.</strong> This often results in plumbers undersizing their recommendations, “not taking into account the fact that they take longer to regenerate hot water,” Foster warned. The best way to find a quality contractor is to use a third party service that has already done the work of vetting plumbers, according to Foster, such as <a href="https://switchison.org/" target="_blank"><u>The Switch Is On</u></a>, or state-specific organizations like Efficiency Maine or <a href="https://techcleanca.com/" target="_blank"><u>TECH Clean California</u></a>. A properly-informed contractor will also be able to access special rebates that aren’t available to consumers, according to Foster.<br/>
</li>
<li><strong>You might want to consider doing a whole-home assessment while you’re at it.</strong> If you’re already planning on making the switch from a gas stove to an induction stove in addition to replacing your water heater, for instance, you can consolidate your home renovation plans with help from organizations like <a href="https://www.quitcarbon.com/" target="_blank"><u>Quit Carbon</u></a>.</li>
</ul><h2>HEATMAP RECOMMENDS</h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="recommends">For small family homes, DIYers, or victims of a gas water heater emergency, get the <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/Rheem-Performance-Platinum-ProTerra-50-Gal-120-Volt-Plug-in-Smart-Heat-Pump-Water-Heater-with-10-Year-Warranty-XE50T10HM00U0/317100789?g_store=&source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&pla&utm_source=google&utm_medium=vantage&utm_campaign=23998&utm_content=25649&mtc=SHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-D26P-026_010_WATER_HEATER-NA-RHEEM-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-MK862549001-23998-NBR-2529-NA-VNT-FY24Q1_Q4_Rheem_D26_RM__AON&cm_mmc=SHOPPING-RM-RMP-GGL-D26P-026_010_WATER_HEATER-NA-RHEEM-NA-PMAX-NA-NA-MK862549001-23998-NBR-2529-NA-VNT-FY24Q1_Q4_Rheem_D26_RM__AON-71700000117584304--&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwq_G1BhCSARIsACc7NxoyaQgI2VlSYWjBjvGg9tRU9w0d5uOcoOLaRKGN0dNMxpa17YDQJV4aAleaEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">120-Volt Rheem ProTerra Plug-in Heat Pump Water Heater</a>.</h4><p>
	This plug-in model caused 
	<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/finally-a-heat-pump-water-heater-that-plugs-into-a-standard-outlet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quite a stir</u></a> when it came out two years ago, and for good reason. Its low voltage allows it to be plugged into a standard outlet, making it a great fit for smaller homes with fewer residents, or anyone in need of a quick fix. (This is also a relatively foolproof choice for DIYers because of the quick and easy installation process.) For those wanting a model with a bit more flexibility but still an easy install, there’s the <a href="https://www.lowes.com/pd/A-O-Smith-Electric-Heat-Pump-Water-Heater/5014375291" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A.O.

Alternatively, you can go for the <a href="https://www.rheem.com/heatpumpwaterheaters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>120-Volt Rheem ProTerra Plug-in Water Heater with HydroBoost</u></a>, which utilizes a mixing valve for maximum hot water output.
</p><p>
	If app functionality is especially important to you, Rheem’s ProTerra line might be particularly appealing. The EcoNet app allows users to monitor the hot water heater from their phone, with status updates on potential leaks as well as compressor health, hot water availability and the unit’s set water temperature.

	Split-system heat pump water heaters are the answer for truly huge houses, where the heat pump itself is outside while the storage tank remains inside. “You can chain together as many heat pump units as you want with as many storage tanks as you want,” Foster said. “So you can create as big a system as you want.” While split-system heat pump water heaters are much less widely-available in the U.S. than they are in Asia and Europe, you can purchase this one online. SANCO is also shipping a new fifth generation unit soon, Quit Carbon advises, which may prove more cost-effective and will qualify for more rebates in California.

	The quietest HPWH on the market, at 45 decibels, is made by A.O. Smith, according to Foster. It’s available in 50, 65, and 80 gallon sizes, so it can accommodate a variety of household types. Another quiet option is 
	<a href="https://www.lg.com/global/business/hvac/residential-solutions/water-heater" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>LG’s Inverter Heat Pump Water Heater</strong></u></a>, though LG is much newer to the heat pump water heater game than Rheem and A.O. Smith, so it may be more difficult to find qualified contractors.
</p><h2>WHAT’S NEXT?<br/></h2><h3 class="rm-anchors" id="risk">A GIANT ASTERISK</h3><p>
	Three more expert contractors I spoke with — Nate Adams, a longtime HVAC insulation and sealing contractor in West Virginia who specializes in electrification retrofits for homeowners; John Semmelhack, an HVAC consultant and the owner of Think Little, a building science consulting firm specializing in mechanical system design for passive house and net-zero energy homes; and Tim Portman, the owner of Portman Mechanical, specializing in electrification, heating and cooling, and home performance — had concerns about heat pump water heater installations.
</p><p>
	Adams said heaters he’s installed have had a 50% failure rate, while Portman and Semmelhack cite a 60% failure rate. These issues have seemingly cropped up after 2018 and are almost entirely occurring with A.O. Smith and Rheem’s fifth generation of water heater models; older generations performed and continue to perform much better. “All my installs from 2014-2018 are still running to my knowledge,” says Adams. “Which is a big part of my frustration— we had this figured out already.”
</p><p>
	The specific causes of these failures vary, spanning from tanks bursting to heat pumps losing charge, according to Adams. Semmelhack and Portman, meanwhile, pointed mainly to refrigerant leaks and compressor issues. (A.O. Smith and Rheem did not respond to requests for comment.) “All of the failures are happening inside the first year of operation,” noted Semmelhack. “So it's happening pretty quick, which makes us think that it's a factory problem and not an environmental problem inside the household.”
</p><h4>For those who don’t mind waiting, keep an eye on Cala, a promising water heater startup.</h4><p>Semmelhack and Portman are hopeful about <strong>Cala</strong>’s new heat pump water heaters, which use an AI-powered control system to forecast hot water demand and heat the water in the tank accordingly with a heat pump. They’re aiming to start shipping those units in 2025, and you can preorder and learn more <a href="https://www.calasystems.com/reservation" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h3 style="text-align: center;"><span></span>NOW TAKE A BATH!</h3>

## A Climate-Conscious Buyer’s Guide for Washers and Dryers

	Americans love laundry. Of the common household chores, it is 
	<a href="https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/34786-americas-favorite-least-favorite-chores" target="_blank"><u>by far the most popular</u></a> — <em><em>and</em></em> the most energy-intensive. Washing and drying a load of laundry every two days for a year generates roughly the same emissions as driving from Chicago to New York and back again in a gasoline-powered passenger vehicle. Nearly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/nov/25/carbon-footprint-load-laundry" target="_blank"><u>three-quarters</u></a> of those emissions come from drying alone; meanwhile, according to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/c&e/pdf/ce5.1a.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Environmental Protection Agency</u></a>, the average washing machine generates up to 8% of a home’s total energy use. The whole process can cost <a href="https://www.ohmconnect.com/blog/home-improvement/the-washing-machine-energy-use-guide-saving-money-and-the-planet#:~:text=Front%2Dloading%20machines%20tend%20to,%2460%20per%20year%20in%20Texas" target="_blank"><u>up to $150 per year</u></a> in electricity alone, depending on where you live and the frequency of your washes.<br/>
</p><p>
	With some regulatory prodding, manufacturers have tried to improve water and energy efficiency in new appliances and have rolled out fancy new features like “smart” water-level sensors, vibration reduction technologies, and microfiber-catching filters. But not every house — or budget — has room for the latest and greatest technologies, and systems that would work well in an airy Los Angeles laundry room might make less sense in a drafty apartment in Minnesota.
</p><p>
	Heatmap is here to remove some of the guesswork from upgrading one of your home’s most-used appliances. Here is our expert panel’s insight into when and how to purchase a new washer and dryer for your home.

He has also written extensively about washers and dryers for publications such as <em><em>The Family Handyman</em></em>, <em><em>Taste Of Home</em></em>, and <em><em>Earth911</em></em>.
</p><h2>OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS</h2><ul>
<li>Determine whether you <a href="#need">need</a> to purchase a new washer or dryer.</li>
<li>Consider your <a href="#space">laundry space</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#recommends">Get shopping</a>!</li>
<li><a href="#handy">Maintain</a> your washer and dryer.</li>
<li>Consider other ways to <a href="#expert">lower the impact of your laundry</a>.</li>
</ul><h2>THE BASICS</h2><ul>
<li>Familiarize yourself with the <strong>EnergyGuide</strong> and <strong>Energy Star</strong> labels. EnergyGuide labels are <em><em>yellow</em></em>, managed by the Federal Trade Commission, and must be displayed on all washers and dryers (you can learn how to read an EnergyGuide label <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwh5ZiRneiw&ab_channel=NPPDTV" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>). Energy Star labels are <em><em>light blue squares </em></em>managed by the Environmental Protection Agency and are only given to products that are deemed highly energy efficient. In a given year, the top-tier Energy Star products are awarded an even higher classification: <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/most-efficient/me-certified-clothes-washers/results?is_most_efficient_filter=Most+Efficient" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy Star Most Efficient</u></a>. You can think of an Energy Star certification as a shortcut for interpreting the information on an EnergyGuide; if an appliance you’re looking at has an Energy Star label, you can count on it being an efficient product.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Energy Star looks at a washing machine’s <strong>Integrated Modified Energy Factor</strong>, or <strong>IMEF</strong>, an efficiency measurement that considers the energy used during a cycle and while on standby, the energy used to heat the water, and the energy used to run the dryer. The <em><em>higher</em></em> the IMEF, the <em><em>more energy-efficient </em></em>the machine. Energy Star requires an IMEF of at least 2.76 for front-loading washing machines; the upper end of the IMEF scale is usually around 3.1.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li><strong>Annual energy use </strong>is measured in kilowatt-hours per year. The number is an estimate based on using a washer under “typical conditions,” assuming 295 loads per year, or six loads per week. Annual energy use differs from IMEF in that it does not take into account how effective the washer is at removing moisture from the clothes in its spin cycle (washing machines that remove more water reduce subsequent energy use in the dryer). For context, an average washing machine used three times a week with cool or warm water goes through <a href="https://www.energysage.com/electricity/house-watts/how-many-watts-does-a-washing-machine-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>roughly</u></a> 140 kilowatt-hours per year.<br/>
</li>
<li>The other number you’ll want to look at is the <strong>Integrated Water Factor</strong>, or <strong>IWF</strong>, which describes efficiency in gallons of water consumed per cubic foot of capacity. The <em><em>lower</em></em> the IWF, the <em><em>more water-efficient</em></em> the machine. Energy Star requires an IWF of at least 3.2 or less for a front-loading washing machine, with the lower end typically around 2.7.<br/>
</li>
<li>The volume of washers and dryers is measured in <strong>cubic feet. </strong>Washers are usually measured as “compact,” “small,” “medium,” or “large” capacity.<strong> </strong>A <em><em>compact</em></em> washer has a 2.30 to 2.45 cubic foot capacity, which is big enough for about 10 pounds of laundry. That’s approximately two small armfuls of clothing, or <a href="https://www.brayandscarff.com/blog/whats-the-largest-capacity-washer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>roughly</u></a> six bath towels.<br/>
</li>
<li>Washers come in two configurations: <strong>top-loading</strong> and <strong>front-loading</strong>. The names are self-explanatory, but the benefits aren’t necessarily. “Front loaders are generally more efficient than top-loading clothes washers,”<em><strong> </strong></em>Mauer told me, “although there is a big range of efficiency within top-loading machines, so some are a lot more efficient than others.” Front-loading washers are also pretty air-tight, however, and their doors should be left slightly ajar when they’re not in use to prevent mold.<br/>
</li>
<li>Traditional dryers are <strong>vented</strong>, meaning that they heat air with gas or electricity and then disperse that hot, humid air through an exterior vent to the outside as the clothes tumble dry. <strong>Ventless</strong> dryers come in two forms — <em><em>condenser </em></em>and <em><em>heat pump </em></em>dryers, which we’ll get into more below — and recycle the hot air inside without needing a vent connecting them to the outdoors.</li>
</ul><h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. If I’m getting a new washer or dryer anyway, shouldn’t I spring for all the latest features?</h4><p>
	Peruse the latest washers and dryers and you’ll see features like sensors that adjust the water level to match the load of laundry, voice-activated start buttons, WiFi-enabled push notifications for when it’s time to move a load to the dryer, and more. And while there are environmentally friendly upsides to some of these features, “the more simple the machine, the less likely that things will fail,” Flint told me. In his experience repairing hundreds of washers and dryers over the years, “People save money on their initial purchase and the machine is going to last longer if you can minimize the features.”
	<strong><br/>
</strong>
</p><h4>2. If it’s Energy Star certified, is that good enough?</h4><p>
	The Energy Star certification is a great starting point in your shopping journey. But it shouldn’t be the be-all, end-all of your research. Energy Star represents a range of efficiency standards from different brands, with only the top models earning a “
	<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/most-efficient/me-certified-clothes-dryers/results?other_features_and_characteristics_filter=Paired+with+ENERGY+STAR+Clothes+Washer&is_most_efficient_filter=Most+Efficient" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Most Efficient</u></a>” distinction.
</p><p>
	You’ll still want to read reviews to get a better understanding of the reliability of the products you’re looking at, too. Though many new features on the market promise water and energy savings, they’re 
	<a href="https://whyy.org/segments/harder-fix-stuff-days-maybe-thats-problem/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>harder to repair yourself</u></a>, meaning any potential fixes can get expensive. They <a href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/the-lifespan-of-large-appliances-is-shrinking-e5fb205b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>can also have shorter lifespans</u></a> than simpler models.
</p><h4>3. Will I pay for all those energy savings with my time? That is, will my clothes take forever to dry?</h4><p>
	Eco-friendly washers and dryers are great for a whole laundry list 
	<em>(</em><em><em>get it?</em></em><em>)</em> of reasons: They lower your household energy bill, they reduce emissions, they reduce wasted water, they’re often easier to install, and they can be gentler on your clothes. But they don’t necessarily save you time. Energy-efficient electric dryers can take up to twice as long to dry your clothes than traditional gas dryers. Still, all of our expert panelists agreed the upsides outweigh the drawbacks.
</p><h2>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED</h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="need">1. Do you really need a new washer or dryer?</h4><p>
	Yes, this is a buying guide for purchasing a new washer and dryer. But before you spend money on new appliances, you should consider working with what you already have.
</p><p>
	If you’re dealing with an old or sub-optimally functional machine and wondering whether now is the time to upgrade, repairing your existing washer or dryer can actually be a smarter and thriftier solution; in fact, 
	<em><em>Consumer Reports</em></em> <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/clothes-dryers/should-you-repair-or-replace-your-broken-clothes-dryer-a1037372822/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only recommends</u></a> replacing a dryer if it’s over 10 years old, electric, and cost less than $700 when you initially purchased it. Often, whatever’s going on doesn’t even require a professional to fix. “I think only rarely — let’s say about 20% of the time — would most people need to call in a technician,” Flint told me. Most washer and dryer problems are something you can fix using “normal household tools.” (More on that later.)
</p><p>
	Keep in mind, even if you have an old washer or dryer that isn’t very energy efficient, “that’s still not even going to come close to touching the amount of energy that was used to produce and ship a new machine,” McDaniel told me. When your washer or dryer “actually fully stops working and it’s not doing what you need it to do — 
	<em><em>that’s</em></em> when it’s time to upgrade.”
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Out with the old?</h4>
<p>
	If you are getting rid of a washer or dryer, do so responsibly; consider 
			<a href="https://www.mrappliance.com/blog/2020/may/don-t-trash-it-here-s-where-to-donate-appliances/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">donating it</a> or if it’s beyond repair, seek out the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/rad/find-rad-partner-programs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Responsible Appliance Disposal Program</a> in your area.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="space">2. Evaluate your laundry room</h4><ul>
<li><strong>Measure your room.</strong> The three most common configurations of washers and dryers are side-by-side, stacked, and all-in-one. The former takes up the most space, while an all-in-one takes up the least and is better for tight spaces like apartments.</li>
<li><strong>Do you have downstairs neighbors you need to consider?</strong> Front-loading washing machines are typically quieter than top-loaders because they use gravity, rather than an agitator, to dry clothes and could be a better choice if noise is a consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Check what hookups you already have.</strong> An electric dryer requires a four-prong, 240-volt outlet (that’s twice the electricity of a regular wall outlet). A gas dryer requires a gas hookup as well as a standard 110/115-volt outlet. You can learn more about the required hookups and what they look like <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/3-and-4-wire-dryer-receptacles-1152226" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Can you cut a hole in your wall?</strong> Vented dryers expel hot air, so they must be installed against an exterior wall with a vent hole cut into it (note that gas dryers must always be installed this way since they expel carbon monoxide). Ventless dryers are lower maintenance and can be installed anywhere, including in nontraditional laundry spaces like kitchens, since they don’t require a hookup to the outside.</li>
<li><strong>What is the temperature control and ventilation like in your space?</strong> Traditional vented dryers expel heated air outside, so shouldn’t affect the indoor environment, but ventless options can impact ambient air temperatures in your laundry room. A condenser dryer, for example, brings in ambient air, heats it, and passes it over the clothes in the drum to dry them; the hot air then enters a heat exchanger, where it is cooled, condensing the moisture, which is expelled through a drain. To work best, condenser dryers usually need to be in a well-ventilated room between the temperatures of 64 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and it <a href="https://www.cda.co.uk/laundry/condenser-vs-vented/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may warm the room</u></a> slightly when it’s running, which is less ideal for homes in hot climates. On the other hand, heat pump dryers work like refrigerators in reverse, warming ambient air and recirculating it inside the drum; they, in turn, can cause the laundry room they’re in to cool down slightly. They’re also less well suited for garages or outbuildings since, like condenser dryers, they need a minimum ambient temperature between about 65 and 75 degrees to operate most effectively.</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Do you need a matching washer and dryer set?</h4>
<p>
	There are a number of advantages to purchasing a matching washer and dryer set. Manufacturers design a set to work together with the same size load, and a matching pair tends to fit and look better when placed side by side. It’s wasteful to replace both machines if only one of the pair has stopped working, however. Embrace the asymmetry.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4>3. How much laundry do you do, and what capacity do you need?</h4><p>
	Typically, 1.5 to 3.4 cubic feet of capacity is 
	<a href="https://www.whirlpool.com/blog/washers-and-dryers/what-size-washer-do-i-need.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suitable</u></a> for a one- to two-person household, 3.5 to 4.4 cubic feet will do for two to three people, and 4.5 or more cubic feet will serve a household with more than three people. But having a new baby or pets might mean you do more loads of laundry than an average household, in which case sizing up is better.
</p><p>
	Flint told me a common mistake he sees people make is overloading their washing machines, which can destroy an appliance’s rear bearing — the part of the machine that helps the drum rotate smoothly — a repair that is often so costly, it can make more sense to junk the whole machine. On the other hand, running small loads in a large-capacity washing machine can mean wasting water cleaning not-as-many clothes. Consider what washing machine would make the most sense for your needs to maximize efficiency.
</p><h4>4. What else is important to you?</h4><p>
	Energy and water efficiency are two of the most common considerations when buying a washer and dryer, and are the primary focus of this guide. Some consumers may have additional concerns — McDaniel, for example, recommended looking for a Restriction of Hazardous Substances certification, which signals that an appliance complies with limits on heavy metals like lead and cadmium. Ethical considerations — including a manufacturer’s contributions to armed conflicts, labor practices, and sourcing of conflict minerals — are also worth close inspection. 
	<em><em>Ethical Consumer</em></em> offers an excellent <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/home-garden/shopping-guide/washing-machines" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>guide</u></a> for finding a brand that best aligns with your values.

	“The first thing that we always recommend is: If you need something new, try to go refurbished,” McDaniel told me. Still, there’s a right way and a wrong way to make a major second-hand purchase. McDaniel suggested going through a reputable source that offers a warranty, 
	<a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?_dyncharset=UTF-8&browsedCategory=pcmcat1652724434316&id=pcat17071&iht=n&ks=960&list=y&qp=features_facet%3DFeatures~ENERGY%20STAR%20Certified%5Econdition_facet%3DCondition~Open-Box&sc=Global&st=pcmcat1652724434316_categoryid%24abcat0910000&type=page&usc=All%20Categories" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>such as Best Buy</u></a> (when searching online, make sure to filters for “Energy Star” and “open box” and check the product’s condition).
</p><h4>Get cozy with the Energy Star website</h4><p>
	If you prefer the security of a new product, then it’s time to familiarize yourself with the Energy Star website. You can sort by 
	<a href="https://www.energystar.gov/most-efficient/me-certified-clothes-washers/results?is_most_efficient_filter=Most+Efficient" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Energy Star Most Efficient</u></a>, which are the best of the best, as well as by price, brand, volume, front-load vs. top-load, vented, ventless, heat pump, gas, electric, <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/most-efficient/me-certified-clothes-dryers/results?is_most_efficient_filter=Most+Efficient" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>and more</u></a>. Energy Star also makes it easy to <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-laundry-sets/results" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>compare the specs</u></a> of different products (just tick the “compare” box next to the machines you’re looking at, then scroll to the top to hit the orange “compare” button when you’re ready).
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<p>
	The Department of Energy recently adopted new standards for washing machines and dryers that are equivalent to the current 2024 Energy Star standards. “Come 2028, when the standards take effect, all new models will need to meet the performance that current Energy Star models meet,” Mauer told me.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4>To dryer or not to dryer — that is the question</h4><p>
	Dryers are the 
	<a href="https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2010/data/papers/2206.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>biggest energy suck</u></a> in most homes, using two to four times as much energy as new washers and nearly twice as much as new refrigerators. McDaniel told me they are also responsible for the greatest wear and tear on clothes. Dryers are an especially American phenomenon; while more than 80% of households in the U.S. own a dryer, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/americans-europe-culture-shock-laundry-dryer-difference-explained-2023-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just 30% of European households</u></a> do. That is to say, you probably don’t <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@travelsizethor/video/7277660631799500075?q=culture%20shock%20tumble%20drying&t=1701178086707" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>actually</em></em></u><u> need one</u></a>, and if you need to save money or space in your laundry routine, this would be the best place to look to make a cut.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“Not relying on a dryer is huge. I only use mine in the wintertime, and in the summer, I line dry my clothes — and the only reason I don’t do that in the winter is I literally don’t have the space inside,” McDaniel said.</strong> </em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	Traditional vented dryers — the energy guzzlers of the American home — aren’t the only option anymore, though. The next best thing to a clothesline is 
	<a href="https://youtu.be/zw183KZQNwc?feature=shared" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a heat pump dryer</u></a>, which Mauer told me is the “most efficient clothes dryer on the market today,” often far exceeding the Energy Star requirements. Heat pump dryers have <a href="https://cdnsm5-hosted.civiclive.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_13659739/File/Government/Departments/Planning%20Division/Climate%20Action%20Program/EWG%20DRYER%20FACT%20SHEET.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a lower maximum temperature</u></a>, though, so you don’t get that hot-out-of-the-dryer feel when the load is finished. It can also take an hour or more to dry a load of laundry fully. The bright side: Because the heat is lower, heat pump dryers are much gentler on your clothes.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline"><strong>Rebate alert!</strong></h4>
<p>
	Low- and moderate-income households can get 
			<a href="https://homes.rewiringamerica.org/federal-incentives/home-electrification-appliance-rebates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a maximum rebate</a> of up to $840 for installing a heat-pump dryer.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4>A word about warranties</h4><p>
	“A big red flag for us is brands that don’t warranty their products in any capacity,” McDaniel told me. Buying a washer or dryer that is durable is important — Flint told me you should expect to get at least a decade of use out of a washer and dryer with proper maintenance and minor repairs — and a warranty is evidence that a company is building a product that they trust to last.
</p><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="recommends">HEATMAP RECOMMENDS</h2><h4>If you want a really great energy-efficient washing machine, get a top Energy Star front-loader like the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-clothes-washers/details/3555308" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electrolux ELFW7637AT</a>.</h4><p>
	The Electrolux ELFW7637AT has one of the highest energy- and water-efficiency ratings of any washing machine on the market in 2024, with an IMEF of 3.2 and an integrated water factor of 2.6 — both of which are exceptional even by Energy Star’s standards. It also 
	<em><em>works</em></em>. Reviewers have <a href="https://reviewed.usatoday.com/laundry/content/electrolux-elfw7637at-front-load-washing-machine-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lauded</u></a> its SmartBoost stain removal technology, its internal water heater, and its straightforward controls, although its 85-minute cycle time is a little <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/washing-machines/electrolux-elfw7637at/m405209/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>longer</u></a> than many other washers on the market.
</p><h4>If you want an energy-efficient washer for a small space, get a stackable front-loader like the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-clothes-washers/details/2375451/export/pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Miele WXI860</a>.</h4><p>
	Both Flint and McDaniel spoke highly of the German brand Miele, which makes this compact washing machine. Though its capacity is about half that of the Electrolux and it didn’t earn Energy Star’s highest level of certification (it has an IMEF of 2.9 and a IWF of 3.2), it is one of the more reliable and 
	<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/washing-machines/miele-wxi860wcs/m406520/#section:specs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>best-reviewed</u></a> washers on the market.
</p><p>
	Admittedly, you have to pay for that kind of dependability — Miele is a high-end brand with a sticker price that reflects it. The WXI860 gets 
	<a href="https://reviewed.usatoday.com/laundry/content/miele-wwh860-compact-washer-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high marks</u></a> for its cleaning ability, including fill-and-forget auto-dispensing features, and boasts 72% lower energy consumption than conventional washers. Additionally, Miele has “a honeycomb-drum technology, so that when it puts the clothes in the spin cycle, it creates a thin film of water between the drum wall and the laundry,” McDaniel told me, which helps prevent clothing fibers from getting caught. “Little features like that that help keep our clothes in circulation for longer are also more sustainable.”
</p><h4>If you want the cheapest option and are too impatient for a clothesline, get a heat pump dryer like the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-clothes-dryers/details/2397438" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Beko HPD24414W</a>.</h4><p>
	Mauer swears by heat pump dryers, and there are a number of good choices on the market right now. Beko is a favorite of the 
	<em><em>Sustainable Jungle</em></em> team, in part because it has a filtration system to stop microplastics from synthetic fabrics from entering the waterways, as well as the company’s ambitious commitments to low-waste and recycled materials. This ventless Beko heat pump dryer is tiny but mighty, making it a great fit for small spaces (it can even fit under the kitchen counter), and it boasts a 2023 “Most Efficient” rating from Energy Star.
</p><p>
	Being a heat pump dryer, though, it 
	<em><em>can </em></em>take a while to dry clothes — <a href="https://reviewed.usatoday.com/laundry/content/beko-hpd24414w-ventless-dryer-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one tester</u></a> found it took 227 minutes to dry a large, bulky load to 100% — but plan ahead and Beko can give you major savings in the long run. Or, if the Beko isn’t quite what you’re looking for, check out Miele, which <a href="https://reviewed.usatoday.com/laundry/content/product-review-miele-txr860wp-eco-steam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>makes</u></a> its own well-reviewed heat pump dryer (although it is small and pricy).
</p><h4>If you need a dryer but you’re also too impatient to wait 227 minutes, get an electric dryer like the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-clothes-dryers/details/2381636" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Electrolux ELFE7637AT Clothes Dryer</a>.</h4><p>
	If a heat-pump dryer isn’t right for your lifestyle, the Electrolux ELFE7637AT is one of the more impressive electric dryers on the market right now, earning the Energy Star seal of approval. While it still isn’t 
	<em><em>super</em></em> <em><em>fast</em></em> (fast takes a lot of heat, which takes a lot of energy, which makes a machine less efficient), <a href="https://reviewed.usatoday.com/laundry/content/electrolux-elfe7637at-dryer-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reviewers say</u></a> it can get a large load to 100% dry in 60 minutes if need be. It’s also the best-rated electric dryer <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/clothes-dryers/electric-dryer/c30562/#sort=1124%2Cdesc&features-and-specs=1124%3AYes&best-for=green_choice%2C1107" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on </u><u><em><em>Consumer Reports</em></em></u><u>’ list</u></a> that isn’t one of the Samsung, LG, or GE models that Flint frequently gets called out to fix.
</p><h4>If you want a combo washer/dryer but don’t want to sacrifice efficiency, get something with a built-in heat pump like the <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-clothes-washers/details-plus/2407727#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GE Profile PFQ97HSPVDS</a>.</h4><p>
	This combo washer-dryer uses heat pump technology in its dryer, making it one of the more energy-efficient single-unit models on the market. Unlike some of the other options on this list, however, its larger 4.8 cubic foot drum size is big enough for a two- or three-person household. While combo washer/dryers still have some downsides over their two-piece counterparts, including decreased efficiency in cleaning and especially drying, this is 
	<a href="https://reviewed.usatoday.com/laundry/content/ge-profile-pfq97hspvds-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one of the better-reviewed units</u></a> on the market.
</p><h4>If you want a refurbished washing machine, you should look for a Kenmore Whirlpool series 80.</h4><p>
	Flint told me that you can often find older Kenmore Whirlpool series 80 machines on Craigslist that are “
	<em><em>really </em></em>good, and tend to sell for about $250 when refurbished, and often come with a one-year warranty.” The only detriment, he said, is that they’re top-loaders — which waste a lot of water — but “if somebody just really needs a tough machine that is going to last, that was a really good design.”
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">What if I want to buy from a name brand?</h4>
<p>
			Flint, our expert technician, warned me that he frequently encounters problems with brands like GE, Samsung, and LG, which is why he recommends exploring other options first. LG models, however, are the preferred eco-friendly front-loaders 
			<a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/washing-machines/best-eco-friendly-washing-machines-consumer-reports-tests-a5430738463/?srsltid=AfmBOoq5wYpQI_fPEXxdZ-KXPhYKeJqaVRq_VQVF7wD44mpoptflONMq" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by </u><u><em><em>Consumer Reports</em></em></u></a>, and a spokesperson for the company pointed me toward the brand “consistently” being ranked “among the top in reliability” as well as LG’s “extensive warranties” and “comprehensive customer support system.”
		</p>
<p>
	Among the options from GE, Whitney Welch, a company spokesperson, recommended exploring GE Profile UltraFast Combo, which uses heat-pump techonology, as well as the GE & Hotpoint Top Load Cold Water Washing Machines, a new line of products from the company that encourages cold-water washing in order to cut the extensive energy required during the water-heating process.
		</p>
<p>
	Samsung’s spokesperson also highlighted that many of the company’s models have an Energy Star certification, including the “most efficient” distinction. He pointed customers interested in energy-saving options to look for features like “SmartThings,” an app that allows users to monitor appliance energy useage; “AI Energy Mode,” which uses algorithms to estimate electricity bills and reduce energy useage, and “AI-Powered Efficiency,” which optimizes water, detergent, and energy usage in their washers and dryers.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h2>WHAT’S NEXT?</h2><p>
	Congratulations! You’re now the proud owner of a new washer and dryer. What happens now?
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="handy">1. Learn to be handy</h4><p>
	New washers and dryers are unfortunately not designed with longevity in mind — but that doesn’t mean you need to replace them if something goes wrong after four or five years.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“I can go up to a washing machine that is sitting in the dump, and I can open up the door, and I can spin the spin basket, and I can tell that it’s a perfectly good machine,” Flint told me.</strong> </em></em>
</blockquote><p>
	Flint estimates that only about 20% of the time do people actually need to call in a technician to repair their appliances, pointing to fixes like 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQCHQJdjdnk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>replacing a blown fuse</u></a>, unsticking <a href="https://youtu.be/7UwvcO2BW4k" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a front-load washer that won’t spin</u></a>, and swapping out <a href="https://youtu.be/6RmziTUzPw0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a moldy washer door gasket</u></a> as deceptively simple tasks. Get acquainted with DIY YouTube channels <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ScottTheFixItGuy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>like Flint’s</u></a> or <a href="https://appliancefixesmadeeasy.blogspot.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>repair blogs</u></a> that explain solutions to common problems.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">One final word about warranties</h4>
<p>
			Before you shell out on a big repair, check if your appliance is still covered under warranty. Typically, washers and dryers from reliable brands will be covered up to a year, though some are covered for longer.
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4>2. If you do need to hire a technician, do your homework</h4><p>
	Still, sometimes you need to call in the big guns. In that case, Flint recommends doing your due diligence on a review service like Yelp beforehand.
</p><p>
	Once you find someone you like, reach out with the model number of your machine and the symptom you’re experiencing and the technician “should be able to provide you a quote without coming out if they know what they’re doing,” Flint said. If someone 
	<em><em>does</em></em> have to come out to figure out what’s going on, then that visit should be free. “Don’t go with someone who’s going to charge you to come out and diagnose the problem and then charge you to fix it.” Repairs to a front-loading washer will probably run around $170, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/washing-machines/should-you-repair-or-replace-your-broken-washing-machine-a9815676185/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to </u><u><em><em>Consumer Reports</em></em></u></a>.
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="expert">3. Become an expert launderer</h4><p>
	You can extend the life of your washer or dryer by following a few more rules of thumb.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Don’t overstuff your front-loader with heavy fabrics. </strong>Front-loaders have a big open tub, and while it’s tempting to cram it full with a big mat or dog bed, “those are so heavy that during the wash cycle, it actually takes the lifespan down to about four years,” Flint said. Keep loads, especially in front loaders, fairly light.</li>
<li><strong>Clean the lint trap on your dryer. </strong>For one thing, it helps it to run more efficiently. For another, your house <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/clothes-dryers/how-to-prevent-dryer-fires-a6837216286/?srsltid=AfmBOopkqBcToz_j07oWFwzdhKb1JwwqFdjZVfqEao57clTVT0EFOn-J" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>really can catch fire</u></a> if you allow it to build up too much.</li>
<li><strong>Clean the evaporator filter every few cycles</strong> if you have a heat-pump dryer. Here’s a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FT1R54PKmo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>boring yet important</u></a>” video on how to do just that.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t use too much detergent.</strong> It’s bad for your clothes and it can require extra rinse cycles, which means more wear and tear on your machine. You almost certainly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/stop-using-so-much-laundry-detergent/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don’t need to be using as much as you are</a>.</li>
<li><strong>If you have a vented dryer, keep its duct clean.</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8JtZPCWWpY" target="_blank"><u>Here’s a how-to</u></a>.</li>
</ul><h3 style="text-align: center;">NOW GET CLEANING!</h3>

## How (and Why!) to Think About Driving a Little Less

Getting your driver’s license is as close to a coming-of-age ritual as we have; cars inspire everything from our <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/article/me-and-my-motor-interview-bruce-springsteens-life-in-cars-k970xldtl" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>music</u></a> to our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_movie" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>movies</u></a> to the design of <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/asphalt-nation-how-the-automobile-took-over-america-and-how-we-can-take-it-back-jane-holtz-kay/6558815?ean=9780520216204" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>where we live</u></a>. At the same time, the automobile has <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9781419758805" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>boxed out</u></a> other options for getting around, <a href="https://qz.com/135509/more-americans-die-from-car-pollution-than-car-accidents#:~:text=A%20new%20study%20from%20MIT,of%20automobiles%2C%20to%20nearly%20100%2C000." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>poisoned</u></a> the air we breathe, and is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the country’s most significant single cause</u></a> of climate change.
</p><p>
	Driving is 
	<em><em>so</em></em> integral to American life that only <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP5Y2022.DP04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>8% of U.S. households</u></a> currently get by without owning a car (and 20% of those carless households, including mine, are located in the relative mass transit paragon <a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/04/19/komanoff-dissects-new-york-citys-car-baby-boom#:~:text=vehicles%20in%202021%2C-,53.9%20percent,-%2C%20was%20down%20from" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New York City</u></a>). For most people, “giving up driving” is more of a radical thought experiment than a realistic possibility.
</p><p>
	Here’s the thing, though: You can almost certainly drive less than you do right now. Yes, that takes thinking and planning and doing some things differently than the way you’ve always done. (You can also check out our 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/best-ebikes" target="_blank">e-bike guide</a> for more advice on that.) But the majority of car trips made by U.S. drivers are for distances of <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/mission/office-secretary/office-policy/active-transportation/active-transportation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>less than three miles</u></a>. “If I just need to pick up a carton of milk, does it make sense to do that in a 6,000-pound metal box on wheels that is powered by dinosaur juice? Not so much,” Doug Gordon, the cohost of “<a href="https://thewaroncars.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The War on Cars</u></a>,” a podcast about the fight against car culture, told me recently for our guide about how to drive less.
</p><p>
	As urban theorists have argued for decades, America’s overreliance on cars has 
	<em><em>reduced </em></em>our overall freedom. In addition to diminishing our options for getting around — it’s car or bust in places without safe bike lanes, public transportation options, or dense residential and commercial development — there is also the “inescapable dependence on a vast support structure comprising oil refineries, tanker fleets, service stations, repair shops, road crews, traffic police, emergency services, investment in road projects, manufacturing, licensing, registration, insurance, and all who work in these areas,” <a href="https://www.ptua.org.au/myths/freedom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>notes</u></a> the Public Transport Users Association. “Seen this way, even a bicycle permits greater freedom.”

	Cycling is, on balance, usually more convenient than driving (no need to look for parking!), not to mention far cheaper and healthier. Driving costs about $5,522 per year, 
	<a href="https://www.sj-r.com/story/business/columns/2020/08/25/money-on-brain-use-your-bicycle-for-transportation-to-save-money/114360262/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to</u></a> the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics; cycling only 10 miles a week can knock off about $299. Other studies have found that the health benefits of cycling add an additional three to 14 months to your life, even when the possibilities of collisions and air pollution <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/05/12/how-safe-is-bike-commuting-perhaps-less-than-you-think/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are factored in</u></a>.
</p><p>
	We can’t just Tesla our way out of the global emissions problem, either. To reduce transportation emissions by 45% by 2030, we would need 70 million electric vehicles on the road — 
	<em><em>in addition to</em></em> reducing miles driven 20% per capita, <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/urban-land-use-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RMI has found</u></a>. Public transportation or cycling are the next best options for most people in most places.
</p><p>
	E-bikes, especially, are incredible car replacement tools, helping to make otherwise daunting commutes manageable for a bigger pool of people (you don’t even have to be athletic!). While there can be sticker shock shopping around, there are also also all kinds of e-bike incentive programs and lending libraries available, and even higher-end models cost cost a fraction of a car at the end of the day. (“Well, but what if it 
	<em><em>rains?</em></em>” As the old Scandi saying goes, there’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Motorcycle-Protector-Waterproof-Reflective-Accessories/dp/B0BGXM86Y1/ref=asc_df_B0BGXM86Y1/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=696285193871&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=3253391992789135865&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9045997&hvtargid=pla-2281435176898&psc=1&mcid=c69da094bb923c2386b87d9f7c23505c&hvocijid=3253391992789135865-B0BGXM86Y1-&hvexpln=74&gad_source=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no such thing as bad weather</u></a>; just bad clothing..)
</p><p>
	Americans admittedly have one very good reason to resist letting go of their cars: Our infrastructure is so overwhelmingly car-centric that it is actively hostile to people who are thinking about alternative ways of getting around. “So often in the United States, we think about things like, ‘What is the most convenient way for every single person in a car to get from Point A to Point B with as few obstacles as possible?’” Alexa Sledge, the director of communications at 
	<a href="https://transalt.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Transportation Alternatives</u></a>, a nonprofit organization that promotes non-polluting and safe travel in New York City, told me. “But that leaves so many people behind.”
</p><p>
	This might actually be one of the biggest social benefits of using your car less: It will, in turn, open your eyes to how little room has been left for anything else. “Reimagining how we’re going to truly allocate our public resources — our public dollars, our public services — to serve everyone is so important,” Sledge stressed. Looking around, you’ll realize there is almost never a justifiable reason for your suburb or city to lack protected bike lanes or sidewalks or crosswalks — other than because they weren’t expected or demanded in the first place. What a failure of imagination 
	<em><em>that</em></em> is.
</p><p>
	And the best part? Even as you think about driving a little less, you can still love cars. A car 
	<em><em>can</em></em> be an incredible freedom machine. But it isn’t the only one.

	“The only thing better for the climate than buying an EV over a gasoline-powered car is buying no car at all,” the climate scientist 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/rob-jackson-book" target="_self"><u>Rob Jackson</u></a> has written. But for many Americans, not having a car <em><em>at all </em></em>is the stuff of logistical and cultural nightmares. The average person living in the U.S. covers <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/auto-loans/a32880477/average-mileage-per-year/" target="_blank"><u>more than 1,000 miles per month</u></a> in their vehicle, and <a href="https://itdp.org/2024/01/24/high-cost-transportation-united-states/#:~:text=Nearly%2045%25%20of%20Americans%20have,the%20high%20costs%20of%20transportation." target="_blank"><u>nearly 45%</u></a> of people don’t even have the option of opting for public transportation. Ditching your <em><em>car</em></em>? You might as well ask people to give up their cell phones.<br/>
</p><p>
	But across the country, transportation advocates and e-bike warriors are looking for solutions to go, if not 
	<em><em>entirely</em></em> car-less, then at least car-light. Heatmap has put together a comprehensive guide to help you make a decision that best fits your lifestyle, whether that’s becoming a superpedestrian, a committed e-bike user, or just trying to replace a couple of short-haul drives a week.

</p><h2>OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS</h2><ul>
<li>Free yourself from a <a href="#mindset">car-centric mindset</a>.</li>
<li>Look for trips where you can <a href="#replace">replace a drive</a> with public transportation, walking, or cycling.</li>
<li>Consider the local <a href="#geo">geography</a> and the <a href="#weather">weather</a>.</li>

<li>Take an e-bike for a <a href="#recommends">test spin</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#advocate">Make your community safer</a> for people who don’t drive.</li>
</ul><h2>THE BASICS</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Active transportation</strong> or <strong>active mobility </strong>refers to human-powered getting-around — such as walking, using a bicycle, e-bike, skateboard, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_scooter" target="_blank"><u>kick scooter</u></a>, or electric kick scooter — that reduces the reliance on cars. Forms of active mobility are often used for <strong>first-mile</strong> or <strong>last-mile connectivity</strong> in conjunction with public transportation systems (that is, for the first and last leg of a trip that connects a person with their transit stop and their starting point or destination).</li>
<li><strong>E-bikes</strong> are bicycles with small electric motors that can assist in pedaling, making them easier to ride. They come in three classes, each of which has its own optimal use case and standard features: </li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline"><strong>Which class is right for you?</strong></h4>
<p>
<strong>Class 1:</strong> Pedal assist <em>only</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feels like:</strong> A little bit of tailwind</li>
<li><strong>Max speed:</strong> Pedal assist tops out at 19.5 mph</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions:</strong> Allowed on any trail or path where traditional “analog” bikes are allowed*</li>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Beginners, people on a budget, or people who want the flexibility to ride their e-bike anywhere</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Class 2:</strong> Pedal assist <em>and</em> throttle
		</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feels like:</strong> A medium amount of tailwind</li>
<li><strong>Max speed:</strong> Pedal assist and throttle top out at 19.5 mph</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions:</strong> Allowed on most paths and trails where traditional bikes are allowed (some restrictions may apply)</li>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> People who want to ride long distances without having to pedal, or who live in a hilly area</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>Class 3:</strong> Pedal assist <em>or</em> pedal assist and throttle
		</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feels like:</strong> “A hurricane vibe,” according to Dean</li>
<li><strong>Max speed:</strong> Pedal assist tops out at 27.5 mph**, or at 19.5 mph with the throttle</li>
<li><strong>Restrictions:</strong> Often restricted on bike paths and multi-use pedestrian trails; riders are required to wear helmets; the bike must have a speedometer; and age restrictions may apply</li>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> People who plan to use their bike to replace car commutes or to run bigger errands</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>*Alaska and Rhode Island classify e-bikes as motor vehicles and may have additional restrictions.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>**If 28 miles per hour sounds utterly terrifying to you, don’t worry. “The majority of the class 3 bikes that I sell will probably never go faster than 15 miles an hour because that’s how the customer wants to ride it,” Dean explained. “Class 3 bikes will not instantly go 28 miles per hour.” </em>
</p>
</div>
</div><ul>
<li>Another thing to look for when shopping for an e-bike is if it has a <strong>hub-drive</strong> or a <strong>mid-drive motor</strong>. As you can probably guess, a hub-drive motor “is built into the hub of one of the wheels,” while a mid-drive motor “is built into the frame near the cranks,” Lau told me. “Usually, a hub drive system will be less expensive than a mid-drive system, but a mid-drive system is considered to ride a bit smoother and has a more balanced center of gravity,” he said.</li>
<li>E-bike battery capacity is measured in <strong>watt hours</strong> — quite literally, how many watts can be delivered in an hour. The usual range for e-bike batteries is between 300 watt hours and 1,000 watt hours. Many factors contribute to how fast you drain the battery, from the surface you’re riding on to its grade to the speed of pedal assist. But generally speaking, <a href="https://www.cyclevolta.com/understanding-e-bike-power-range-and-energy/#:~:text=The%20units%20of%20electric%20power,being%20the%20prefix%20indicating%201%2C000." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>you can expect to use</u></a> about 10 to 20 watt hours per mile. (Want to have some fun? Mess around with <a href="https://www.bosch-ebike.com/us/service/range-calculator?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgCloTujAOsC9QPR4HRDjJZ7zCDVUVUW2ba3d64AZzRJwM72NlkdgHSZxoCPNsQAvD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bosch’s e-bike range calculator</u></a> to get a sense of how far you can go and with what effort.) </li>
<li>In addition to e-bikes, you might also see references to <strong>electric motorcycles</strong>, <strong>Vespas</strong>, or <strong>mopeds</strong>. Most of these fall under the class of <strong>motor</strong> <strong>scooters</strong>, which are differentiated from e-bikes in that they don’t have pedals (they are also different from <strong>e-scooters</strong> like <a href="https://www.li.me/vehicles/scooter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lime</u></a>, which are modeled on human-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kick_scooter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>kick scooters</u></a>). Also unlike e-bikes, motor scooters require a driver’s license and must be registered as a motor vehicle. An electric motorcycle will require a motorcycle license if it goes over 30 mph. Scooters are also much heavier than e-bikes, don’t have removable batteries, and may run on gasoline, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/going-green-via-scooters-or-car-sharing/2013/04/01/1f238720-957e-11e2-ae32-9ef60436f5c1_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>canceling out some of the environmental and health advantages</u></a>.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="mindset">1. I live in the suburbs — is it even possible to go car-less?</h4><p>
	Only 
	<a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP5Y2022.DP04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>8% of U.S. households</u></a> currently get by without owning a car, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-09-27/biking-to-work-isn-t-gaining-any-ground-in-the-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>less than 1%</u></a> of Americans commute to work by bike. The U.S. is so driving-centric that we’re home to one-fifth of all the cars <em><em>on the planet </em></em>despite having less than 5% of the global population.<em> </em>Eleven states have <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/auto-insurance/car-ownership-statistics#:~:text=Montana%20has%20184%20vehicles%20registered,Show%20All%20Rows" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more registered </u></a>vehicles than people.
</p><p>
	But just because driving has always been your default doesn’t mean it makes the most sense for the kind of travel you do — even if you live somewhere without great public transportation. Over half of all trips Americans make in a car are for a distance of 
	<a href="https://www.transportation.gov/mission/office-secretary/office-policy/active-transportation/active-transportation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>less than three miles</u></a> — perfect to convert into a bike ride.
</p><blockquote>
<em><strong>“I think of mobility like a Swiss army knife: You have to use the right tool for the job,” Gordon told me. “If I just need to pick up a carton of milk, does it make sense to do that in a 6,000-pound metal box on wheels that is powered by dinosaur juice? Not so much.”</strong></em>
</blockquote><p>
	On average, commuting by bike in the U.S. saves an estimated $2,500 per year, and it 
	<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2023/10/05/surprising-new-way-of-getting-to-work-benefits-mental-health-plus-2500-annual-savings/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has been found</u></a> to have massive benefits for one’s mental health, cardiovascular health, and even productivity at work. Yes, <a href="https://www.peopleforbikes.org/news/the-health-benefits-of-electric-bikes?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwoJa2BhBPEiwA0l0ImGc3lRfjIFtZamTSulafDHsPHT7DtAS14MrbaecDkfTmeoDF8tRrxxoC05gQAvD_BwE" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>even e-bikes</u></a>!
</p><p>
	“If you go to places like Copenhagen or Amsterdam — places where there are huge numbers of cyclists — and you poll those people, concern for the environment barely cracks the top five reasons why they cycle,” Gordon said. “The reasons why people cycle in Denmark and the Netherlands are because it’s safe and convenient, and it’s often the fastest and cheapest way to get where they’re going.”
</p><h4>2. If we’re just talking about short trips, will it really make a difference?</h4><p>
	Transportation is 
	<a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the most significant contributor</u></a> to climate change in the United States, with nearly 60% of the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions coming from cars alone (another 23% comes from trucks). Replacing a quarter of your total driving with walking, biking, or e-biking could save 1.3 tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year, according to our friends at WattTime — about the same as forgoing burning 1,433 pounds of coal or three barrels of oil. If every American drove even a mere 10% less per year, it’d be like taking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/climate/one-thing-we-can-do-drive-less.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>28 coal-fired power plants offline</u></a>.
</p><p>
	You can still make a significant impact without ditching your car, in other words: You simply have to drive 
	<em><em>less. </em></em>And the upsides are enormous. More Americans <a href="https://qz.com/135509/more-americans-die-from-car-pollution-than-car-accidents#:~:text=A%20new%20study%20from%20MIT,who%20die%20in%20traffic%20accidents." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>die of car pollution</u></a> than in car accidents every year. Additionally, commuting by bike or by foot makes us healthier and happier.
</p><p>
	It also helps us realize what our community priorities should be. “Individual action is not always what we need to focus on,” Gordon said. “We need to focus on institutional change. But my philosophy is that lots of individual action actually adds up to the political will to get the institutional change you need.”
</p><h4>3. Is it really worth the risk of crashing — or sweating?</h4><p>
	A survey of studies from five countries (including the U.S.) found that 
	<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10546027/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the main barriers to cycling</u></a> were low perceived safety, bad weather, lack of cycling infrastructure (including “shower facilities” at one’s destination), and distance and perceived effort.
</p><p>
	Safety is a valid concern. Riding a bike is about 500 times more likely to be fatal than riding a bus, according to 
	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/05/12/how-safe-is-bike-commuting-perhaps-less-than-you-think/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a 2007 study</u></a>; even with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/nyregion/vision-zero-safety-study.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the success of programs like New York’s Vision Zero</u></a>, collisions with cars remain a real danger for people on bikes. The car-related pollution inhaled while cycling can also shorten a cyclist’s life by an estimated one to 40 days. But the benefits of cycling on average far outweigh the risks: Riding a bike <em><em>adds </em></em>an estimated three to 14 months to your life, even when the possibilities of collisions and air pollution <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2016/05/12/how-safe-is-bike-commuting-perhaps-less-than-you-think/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are considered</u></a>. The health benefits are so significant that <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/16/lifestyle/bike-commuting-lowers-risk-of-early-death-by-47-new-study/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a separate study by Swedish researchers</u></a> found that cyclists had a 47% lower risk of early death and a 10% lower risk of hospitalization compared to car and train commuters.
</p><p>
	What about concerns about shower availability and the “distance and perceived effort” of riding a bike? That’s where the advantages of an e-bike’s pedal assist come into play. “E-bikes are great at blasting through any concerns you have about sweat,” Gordon told me. Even in hot weather or on difficult terrain, pedal assist can keep you looking fresh when you arrive at the office.
</p><h2>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED</h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="replace">1. How much driving can you realistically replace with other modes of transportation?</h4><p>
	The first step to driving less is thinking about when and where you can replace specific trips with walking, cycling, or public transportation instead. Lau told me his general rule of thumb is that if a trip is less than a mile and he can safely walk (i.e. if there are sidewalks or safe paths), then he’ll walk. “If it’s more than that, I’ll take the bike if I have a place to lock it or can bring it into my workplace or store,” he said. For trips where he might need some extra assistance — that are farther, longer, hillier, or will require carrying “more cargo without working as hard,” he’ll opt for an e-bike instead.

	You can do a lot of this reconnaissance from your couch. Apple Maps and 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/q-and-a-google-maps-yael-maguire" target="_self"><u>Google Maps</u></a> can take a lot of the guesswork out of finding the best bike paths to and from your house and the other places you frequent, including informing you ahead of time if the route will require riding on major or minor roads or ones with protected bike lanes. Google and Apple Maps can also give you real-time information about public transportation options in your area (as well as allow you to plan for trips when service might be reduced, like late nights or weekends), and many transit systems now have their own apps to make tracking delays or alternative service simpler.

<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">It’s okay to take it slow</h4>
<p>
	There’s no need to go overboard here, at least not to start! “The thing to think about is not ‘Can I go completely car-free?’ but ‘What trips could I replace?’” Gordon told me. It’s like Meatless Mondays: “You don’t have to become a complete vegan overnight, but you could replace one day’s worth of meals a week. It’s the same with cycling: Maybe you could ride to your kid’s soccer game or do one little grocery trip a week to the nearest market and do it by bike instead of by car. See how that feels.”

</div><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="geo">2. What’s the elevation like in your area?</h4><p>
	It’s funny how you don’t realize where the long, slow inclines are in your neighborhood until you’re huffing up them on a bike. Google Maps and Apple Maps can show you what elevation to expect on a walking or cycling route. If you live in a hillier area, an e-bike might be better than a traditional bike since it can take some of the ouch
	<em> </em>out of the ups.
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="weather">3. What’s the weather like in your area?</h4><p>
	“Something really, really important that people don’t always think about is gear,” Sledge told me. “It doesn’t necessarily have to be expensive, but if you can only ride your bike when it’s 80 degrees and sunny, that’s not the best scenario.”
</p><p>
	If you live somewhere where it gets hot, rainy, snowy, windy, or the weather can change unexpectedly, think ahead of time about the sort of gear you’d need to make cycling or walking more comfortable. (We have a checklist of ideas below.)
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="programs">4. What programs exist in your area that you can use to your advantage?</h4><p>
	California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, and Vermont all have statewide tax credits or rebates to encourage e-bike adoption.
</p><p>
	Live somewhere that isn’t on that list? Here is

Also, look for e-bike lending libraries that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=e-bike+lending+library+near+me&sca_esv=820aaa15062e62d5&sca_upv=1&sxsrf=ADLYWIL5xF9wlW9ZGimZVdGkgcXlW1MqKA%3A1724253900062&ei=zAbGZp2xA9Wh5NoP5KqyoQM&ved=0ahUKEwidx9ypsoaIAxXVEFkFHWSVLDQQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=e-bike+lending+library+near+me&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiHmUtYmlrZSBsZW5kaW5nIGxpYnJhcnkgbmVhciBtZTIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRirAjIFECEYkgMyBRAhGJIDMgUQIRiSAzIFECEYkgNIjgtQjgRY3QlwAXgAkAEAmAFsoAHXBqoBAzcuMrgBA8gBAPgBAZgCCaACtwbCAgoQABiwAxjWBBhHwgIGEAAYFhgewgILEAAYgAQYhgMYigXCAggQABiABBiiBJgDAIgGAZAGCJIHAzQuNaAH_jM&sclient=gws-wiz-serp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>might be in your area</u></a>.
</p><p>
	If you’re having trouble learning about the programs available to you, head into a brick-and-mortar e-bike shop in your area or connect with your local transportation advocacy group — they’ll know what programs you can take advantage of and be happy to point you in the right direction.
</p><h4>5. Grab a coffee with the bike geek in your life </h4><p>
	Do you know what bike enthusiasts love more than anything? Creating new bike enthusiasts. If you’re still feeling intimidated by the idea of getting on a bike — or even if you’re not — “find a friend who’s already doing it,” Gordon suggested. Bike people are “an evangelical bunch, and if you tell a friend who you know is into biking or bike commutes regularly that ‘Hey, I’m thinking of doing it,’ I can guarantee that person will be more than happy to hold your hand and help you through your first ride.”

<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Taking off the training wheels</h4>
<p>
			Many people are understandably scared of riding a bike alongside cars. If you want to build up a little more confidence before hitting the road, the Global Cycling Network has a good 
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOASHDryAwU" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>intro to urban cycling video</u></a> that covers some of the basics about holding your place in the lane, signaling, and avoiding dangerous blindspots.
		</p>
<p>
			You can also build up confidence on bike paths and pedestrian trails where you don’t have to contend with cars or look to join group rides in your area. Meet-ups in particular are a great place to make bike friends and will help you get comfortable navigating the streets in your area. (In Portland, for example, there are 
			<a href="https://www.shift2bikes.org/pedalpalooza-calendar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hundreds of such events</u></a> to choose from.)
		</p>
</div>
</div><p>
	There are dozens of emissions-free or emissions-light transportation options, from using your own two feet to digging the old beater bicycle out of your garage to going full 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzGWSudVdFA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Steve Wozniak</u></a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Segway</u></a>. The most important thing is to something you’ll actually use.
</p><p>
	That said — “What’s really going to be the best option for most Americans is an e-bike,” Sledge told me. “That’s a true car replacement when so often a [traditional] bike can’t be a true, true, 
	<em><em>true</em></em> car replacement.” E-bikes are simply more practical and comfortable for longer rides or daily commutes, and if you need to haul things like groceries or children, they can’t be beaten.

<em><strong><em>I’ve looked at all my options and don’t think I can drive any less than I already do. What can I do instead?</em></strong></em>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/how-to-buy-an-ev" target="_blank">Get an electric vehicle</a>.</strong> For some people, car trips will be unavoidable — and in that case, replacing gas-powered vehicle miles with battery-electric powered vehicle miles is the next best thing. Here’s Heatmap’s guide to buying an EV for more on that.</li>
<li><strong>Carpool. </strong>It’s absurd how many car trips in the U.S. are made with only one person in the vehicle. Many schools and businesses will help organize carpools, and there are an increasing number of websites dedicated to helping connect commuters. Every carpool saves an unnecessary parallel trip.</li>
<li><strong>Drive more efficiently. </strong>You can save fuel (and reduce your emissions) just by keeping your speed steady. <a href="https://www.dot.ny.gov/programs/climate-change/ecodriving/drive-more-efficiently" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Here’s a good guide</u></a> if you want to learn more.</li>
</ul><h3>The case for saving up for an e-bike</h3><p>
	There’s no way around it: E-bikes are pricy. “An e-bike is going to be a big purchase — nowhere near as much as a car, but still, it’s a major purchase,” Sledge said. Even with incentive programs (more on that below), you’re likely to spend more than $1,000 out of pocket.
</p><p>
	It is tempting to look for a bargain. But Dean stressed that manufacturers and bulk retailers are “sacrificing a lot” in terms of quality and service to make a profit at lower price points. As a rule, “If you’re spending less than $1,000 on any bike, it’s landfill,” he said. “And that waste is toxic — odds are, it isn’t going to be recycled properly.”
</p><p>
	Gordon suggested that if you’re concerned about how often you’ll use an e-bike, it makes sense to get “a cheap regular bike” initially. “Then you can figure out if this is something you want to do in the long term, and after a few weeks, or a month, or a year, you can go, ‘Okay, I’m ready for the $1,000, $2,000, $5,000 bicycle.’”
</p><p>
	Perspective is important, too. Yes, e-bikes are expensive — if you compare them to regular bikes. “If you compare them to cars, they’re a bargain,” Gordon said. “E-bikes are a replacement tool; they’re not an upgrade from other bikes. So if you’re a family with two cars and are going down to one, getting a $2,500 or even $5,000 e-bike is a relative bargain.” Additionally, many retailers — including The eBike Store in Portland, Oregon, where Dean works — offer installment plans to help make the purchase more manageable.
</p><h4>What about conversion kits?</h4><p>
	Conversion kits are a popular way to convert an analog bike you already own into an e-bike by attaching a motor to 
	<a href="https://www.cyclingnews.com/features/types-of-e-bike-conversion-kit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the front hub, rear hub, or mid-drive</a>. Many of these kits can be found cheaply on websites like Amazon, though <em><em>The Washington Post </em></em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/08/20/e-bike-conversion-kits-do-it-yourself/" target="_blank">warns</a> that it is still a “very Wild West market” and to only buy batteries from reputable e-bike battery brands (low-quality batteries <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/11/everything-you-need-to-know-about-e-bike-battery-fires/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHPkjKJCEzgnMSDHiW1hq7tBKLEIG4H9uKbBFPSPI4YPTtY-0MylLlVzx1Df9CEQUd_xFZ3-gCIQ_0_GKXrRGKd07h5vTnik0ctEkD_-Axfbc86QxhRThPiSCv_O8zUbIoXf-iouvWTlcNUt28PCGaht4FyEN2wURjjL4lSyQFyZ" target="_blank">are more likely to start fires</a>). While converting to an e-bike might be a good option for you if you want to dip a toe in the e-bike water, you’ll still need to spend several hundred dollars to get a kit that gives you the same <em><em>oomph</em></em> as an actual e-bike. That said, whatever option gets you on a bike is the best one, and if you’re converter-kit curious, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/build-ebike/" target="_blank">here’s a good guide</a> for learning where to start.

<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">A reminder</h4>
<p>
			We do not live in Northern Europe. Plan accordingly.
		</p>
<p>
			Northern Europe is the global epicenter of bike commuting, and as such, much of the cycling and e-biking world caters to, or is based out of, flat countries like the Netherlands, Denmark, and Belgium. But “the kinds of [analog] bikes that make sense in Northern Europe are a little bit different than the kind of bike that makes sense if you live in New York City, for example,” Sledge said.
		</p>
<p>
			Europeans tend to ride “commuter bicycles that are pretty heavy and really comfortable,” but that will be “really hard for you to go over a major bridge in a major city” or ride on the hills characteristic of places like Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Boston, or New York without pedal assist, Sledge said. If you’re an American, “a road bike is probably going to make a lot more sense for you, and you might not get pointed in that direction at first.”
		</p>
</div>
</div><h4>Where to buy an e-bike</h4><p>
	“Buying a bike at a brick-and-mortar store from competent, kind people who love their job — customers are going to have a fantastic experience,” Dean told me. “They’re going to get a great taste for the bike, which means they’ll be riding it a lot. We’re not in the business of selling bikes that sit and rot in someone’s garage.”
</p><p>
	It is especially important to go to a store with e-bike specialists on staff (rather than a bulk retailer like Costco — or worse, anything online) because the mechanics will have checked the bike over and adjusted the safety points so it’s ready to go. “You’re going to get educated and get a strong appreciation of the beautiful tool that you are buying, and learn how to operate it and make it last,” Dean added.
</p><p>
	Most importantly, though, ensure you take the bike for a test ride before handing over your credit card. Any retailer worth its salt will offer this as an option; the best retailers will take you on a guided test ride, where they’ll teach you how to use the e-bike you’re trying out. But the bottom line is, “Don’t buy a bike that you haven’t ridden,” Dean said. “Ride the bike before you buy it; that’s in all-caps with smiley faces and exclamation points. Don't buy the bike if you can’t ride it first.”
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">How to buy an e-bike</h4>
<p>
			I asked Dean how a customer can come in prepared to buy an e-bike. Here were his top green flags.
		</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be ready to answer, “What kind of experience do you want?” </strong>The e-bike specialist will want to know the geography you anticipate riding through, how far you expect to be riding per day, if you will be hauling cargo, or if you just want an e-bike for fun weekend outings.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t come in with your heart set on one specific bike. </strong>Dean said it’s common for customers to come in with preconceived notions about the sort of e-bike they want to buy. A good e-bike specialist, though, will be your advocate — and let you know if the bike you’re fixated on will <em><em>actually</em></em> meet your needs.</li>
<li><strong>Ask a lot of questions</strong>. This is a big purchase! You want to ensure you’re getting the bike <em><em>you</em></em> want – and understand how it works before you walk out the door.</li>
<li><strong>Find out if the store offers free adjustments. </strong>Both REI and The eBike Store have continued support for their customers within the first year of the purchase. Buy from a retailer that is invested in your success.</li>
<li><strong>Buy the bike that makes you happy. </strong>At the end of the day, “You should buy whatever puts a dumb, happy smile on your face,” Dean said. “New Bike Day is like Christmas without the emotional baggage.”</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><h2 class="rm-anchors" id="recommends">HEATMAP RECOMMENDS</h2><blockquote>
<em>
<strong>“Buy the bike that’s going to put the biggest, dumbest smile on your face.”</strong></em>
</blockquote><h4>
If you want a bike for a long commute, look at the Specialized Como or one of the REI Co-op Cycles-brand models.
</h4><p>
	Dean said he points riders looking to log miles to the Specialized Como. “When you’re commuting long miles, you want something comfortable, something that’s reliable, something that has a strong enough motor that will get you where you’re going and a big-enough battery that you’re not going to sweat it,” he said. The Specialized Como is also an excellent choice for people who want to “show up to work not sweaty” but maybe get a little bit more of a workout on the way home.
</p><p>
	If you prefer commuting on a traditional bike, Lau suggested REI’s ADV 1.1, a road touring bike, or the CTY 1.1 bike, a less-expensive hybrid built for logging longer distances and enduring the daily wear-and-tear of a commute. His e-bike pick for commuters is the CTY e2.2, a popular, well-reviewed, and accessible commuter bike 
	<a href="https://www.rei.com/product/198760/co-op-cycles-cty-e22-electric-bike" target="_blank"><u>specifically marketed</u></a> to “replace car trips.”
</p><h4>
If you want an e-bike to haul the kids, look at a bike from Tern.
</h4><p>
	Dean loves to recommend Tern bikes to people who want to make trips with their kids. “They’ve been doing this for a long time, they have tons of great accessories, and they use Bosch power systems,” he said — all points in the bike’s favor. That customizability and reliability make it a good fit for families who want to be able to tailor the bike to their needs and price point while also not having to worry about it breaking down in the middle of a toddler’s meltdown.
</p><p>
	But there is one other primary reason why Dean points parents to Tern. “All of their bikes are rider first, cargo behind” — versus bucket bikes that put the cargo 
	<a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/ugEGWqvoWxdRxk5AA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in front of the rider</u></a>. While the latter design is also popular, it also means that if you’re trying to squeak out into traffic, you’re nosing your most precious cargo ahead of you, into potential harm’s way.
</p><h4>
If you want an e-bike that can handle your big Trader Joe’s runs, look at the Cannondale Cargowagen or the folding bikes from Tern.
</h4><p>
	Lau offered three options for e-bikes that won’t make you miss the trunk of your car, starting with the Cannondale Cargowagen, which can lug up to 440 pounds — that is a 
	<em><em>lot</em></em> of Chili & Lime Flavored Rolled Corn Tortilla Chips. Its range isn’t quite as good as some other bikes on the market — the battery is 545 watt-hours — so it’s probably a better fit for people who live in higher-density areas or near their preferred market. (You can always buy a second battery if you want a little more range.) The Cargowagen is also a class 3 bike, meaning you won’t have to worry about the ice cream melting before you can get home.
</p><p>
	Like Dean, Lau loves to recommend Tern bikes for handling heavy loads, especially the Tern GSD S00, which conveniently folds up so it can even be stored in an apartment or transported in an elevator while still being compatible with Tern’s line of cargo-carrying products — but at almost $6,000 before add-ons, it’ll likely be out of many first-time e-bikers’ budgets. Tern’s Vektron S10 is a less expensive option and still has the power to handle hilly roads with six Trader Joe’s bags in tow. (Note that both Terns are class 1 bikes, meaning the pedal assist tops out at 20 miles per hour.)
</p><h4>
If you want an e-bike but live in a walk-up, check out bikes from Specialized.
</h4><p>
	“Lightweight e-bikes are out there,” Dean said, and can be had — for the right amount of money. “They’re usually going to start around $3,500 to $4,000 and then go up from there,” he told me, pointing to Specialized as one of his favorite lightweight brands.
</p><p>
	Keep in mind that you may not 
	<em><em>need</em></em> a lightweight e-bike. “No one has ever come in and said, ‘I want a heavy bike,’” Dean pointed out. Electric motors are, by necessity, heavy, so getting a lighter bike can mean sacrificing half the motor and battery. There are workarounds: “If you have stairs to go up, almost all of these bikes have a walk assist mode,” which gently turns the tires so you’re not fighting gravity on your own, Dean told me. Likewise, if you’re trying to load your bike onto a car rack, “you don’t have to Hulk it up there; you can be a little smarter about your efforts by picking up the front wheel and putting it in the rack behind your car. Then pick up the back wheel.” If you’re <em><em>really</em></em> struggling with your bike, you can always pop off the battery — one of the heavier components — and carry it separately.
</p><h4>
If you want a bike or an e-bike but need to keep the price down, look at the REI Co-op CTY e2.1, or bikes from Gazelle, Medeo, or Electra Country.
</h4><p>
	The best new commuter bike you can get away with is the CTY 1.1, the analog bike Lau recommended above, but for an e-bike option, he points customers to the Co-op CTY e2.1, an easy, accessible, no-frills class 1 bike that won’t run you more than $2,000. It might be a little light on features for a serious urban commuter, though.
</p><p>
	Dean told me that the Gazelle Medeo and some of the bikes from Electra Country will have price points that could be more acceptable to customers on a budget. Gazelle uses the reliable Bosch power system, and the Medeo is “really good” and comes in “multiple versions.” (I 
	<a href="https://www.gazellebikes.com/en-us/gazelle-medeo-t9-city-hmb?color=color-light-olive&frame=frame-low" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found one</u></a> for less than $2,000). Electra Country is a subsidiary of Trek and is a “one-size-fits-all, beach cruiser-looking bike” that comes in <a href="https://electra.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/bikes/electra-bikes/electra-e-bikes/c/EB200/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>super fun colors</u></a>.
</p><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">Other essentials you’ll want to consider</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-finger gloves. </strong>“I wear them year-round,” Dean told me. He recommends the full-finger option because, in the unfortunate incident that your chain comes loose, you can pop it back on without getting your hands dirty. Dean especially likes <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/womens-body-geometry-dual-gel-long-finger-gloves/p/156973?color=348660-156973&searchText=67119-1142&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=surfaces-across-google&utm_term=888818471560&srsltid=AfmBOopl1Xaq-24Rp9_5cV7XJdknLASTdL8LflbhNEjb7i-0oU1FoLRwQG8" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Specialized’s gel gloves</strong></a> for extra hand protection.</li>
<li><a href="https://redshiftsports.com/products/arclight-pedals?srsltid=AfmBOoq_kWTd24hHTwRAOw4soc-0bdv2brqGgLQH-1O4dCWpZYJuZZuD" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>Redshift’s Arclight Pedals</strong></u></a><strong>. </strong>Dean told me these are the #1 safety items he sells at The eBike Store. “While most e-bikes have a light in the front and a light in the back, they don’t have any on the side,” he told me. “And more often than not, you’re hit from the side or someone turning into you. Since the lights are on these pedals, and the pedals are moving, people see it and subconsciously go, ‘Oh, that’s a human,’ versus just a tail light, which people go, ‘Oh, that’s a vehicle.’” </li>
<li><strong>A rain jacket. </strong>“My favorite piece of cycling gear is my <a href="https://cleverhood.com/products/rover-rain-cape?srsltid=AfmBOoqkA23ADwIFyhp3-LUNBDYCEGfdd0HUudiDVqBh6jEKifj0rVUZ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Cleverhood rain cape</strong></a> because there’s a saying that goes, There’s no such thing as bad weather for cycling, only bad gear,” Gordon told me.</li>
<li><strong>A good lock. </strong>Think of buying a lock for your bike like it’s the zombie apocalypse, or a bear is chasing you, Dean said: “You don’t have to be the fastest, but <em><em>don’t </em></em>be the slowest.” Get a lock that will make a potential thief look for an easier mark. (Also, don’t lock your bike to something easy to saw through, like a tree or a stop sign.) </li>
<li><strong>A bike fitting. </strong>It might sound expensive — a bike fitting will run you about $150 to $200 — but Dean swears it’s worth every penny. You spend a lot of time on your bike, so why not put in the money to get it perfectly adjusted to fit your specific body, from the saddle being moved to just the right place to making sure the controls are all where they need to be? Dean likened the experience to the difference between going to Nordstrom Rack and buying a good enough suit and having a suit custom-made for you. </li>
<li><strong>A commuter backpack. </strong>You don’t necessarily need a special backpack for bike commuting, but you might find that carrying a load in a traditional backpack will throw off your balance and get your back sweaty. While it’s better to let the bike do the work whenever possible (look for baskets mounted to the front <em><em>frame </em></em>of the bike, not the handlebars), Lau also suggested the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/201323/camelbak-mule-commute-22-hydration-pack-mens" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>CamelBak M.U.L.E. Commute 22 pack</strong></a>, the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/170690/ortlieb-velocity-ps-pack-23l" target="_blank"><strong>Ortlieb Velocity PS pack</strong></a>, and the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/155226/osprey-radial-bike-commuter-pack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Osprey Radial bike pack</strong></a> as great options for commuters.</li>
<li><strong>A helmet. </strong>Helmet philosophies differ. Gordon told me a $25 helmet will protect you as well as a $200 helmet will. Dean, however, said you shouldn’t go <em><em>too</em></em> cheap: “No matter what you pay for a bicycle helmet, it’s going to be less expensive than an ambulance ride.” Lau specifically suggested the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/153000/bontrager-charge-wavecel-bike-helmet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>Bontrager Charge WaveCel</strong></u></a> ($150), the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/203167/lazer-cityzen-kineticore-bike-helmet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>Lazer CityZen KinetiCore</strong></u></a> ($60), and the <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/189224/smith-express-mips-cycling-helmet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>Smith Express MIPS</strong></u></a> ($110), or “multi-directional impact protection system,” a helmet style that includes an internal layer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVn1q3muPCg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">intended to rotate slightly</a> in the case of impact, which is thought to prevent brain injuries. Whatever style you choose, remember that helmets can age out. “Dig your fingernail into the foam of your helmet to see if it’s safe,” said Dean. “If it’s not squishy — if it’s crunchy — throw it away.”</li>
</ul>

	While the benefits of riding a bike (or any other form of active transportation) still outweigh the risks, cars 
	<a href="https://theweek.com/articles/929196/case-against-american-truck-bloat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are getting bigger</u></a>, their blindspots are getting larger, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/26/1184034017/us-pedestrian-deaths-high-traffic-car" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pedestrian</u></a> and <a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/pedestrian-fatalities-at-historic-high/#:~:text=Pedestrian%20fatalities%20are%20up%20again,struck%20and%20killed%20by%20cars." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cyclist</u></a> deaths nationwide are at a 40-year high. Even <a href="https://www.vox.com/23784549/pedestrian-deaths-traffic-safety-fatalities-governors-association" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electric vehicles</u></a> might be a small part of the problem since they’re so much heavier than regular cars — and that much more dangerous if you get hit.
</p><p>
	I asked Sledge how newly carless commuters could become better pedestrians, and she quickly corrected me. “There is no such thing as being a good pedestrian,” she said. “So often, in the United States, when we have groups of people that are consistently harmed by other groups of people, we’re like, ‘How can the victims be better?’ And the real answer is, ‘How can we create systems and designs that protect those people?’”
</p><p>
	We’ll get into that. But the bottom line is: be safe when you’re out on the road. Learn 
	<a href="https://www.sharetheroadtexas.org/safety-tips/best-practices-for-bicycle-and-driver-safety" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>how to navigate intersections safely</u></a>, and don’t take unnecessary risks. <em><em>Especially</em></em> if you’re on an e-bike, “You’re traveling faster than most cars are expecting you to,” Dean said. “To remember that, imagine you are not only invisible, but they’re all trying to kill you.”
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="advocate">
Become a transit advocate
</h4><p>
	“Riding a bike is a really good entry for a lot of people into larger political conversations about climate, the design of their cities or towns, and a host of other issues,” Gordon told me. It might only be a short amount of time before you start to wonder why there aren’t more protected bike lanes in your town or city, or why mass transit isn’t reaching your neighborhood or destination, or why lousy 
	<a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/07/12/bad-road-design-is-stoking-the-u-s-pedestrian-death-crisis-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>road design</u></a> is making your commute more dangerous than it should be.
</p><p>
	There’s some good news, though: There has never been a better time to become a transit advocate. “It could be as small as your block, or your neighborhood, or your city, but there are tons of groups all over the country that focus on working to make them safer and better for the people in them,” Sledge said.
</p><p>
	One of the best places to start is by making your voice and your values heard. As Sledge reminded me, car companies 
	<a href="https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/demise-american-public-transportation/183456/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>already have</u></a> — and continue to spend money and time lobbying policies that are better for drivers (and their bottom lines) than others on the road. But where to begin? “First, I would look for any kind of organization in your community, your neighborhood, or your city that focuses on safe streets or fighting climate change, and see if you can get involved with them,” Sledge said. “And if you don’t have that kind of organization, start to go to your city council meetings, making your voice heard with your local representatives — those kinds of things really make a difference.”
</p><p>
	Another great resource is Transportation for America’s 
	<a href="https://t4america.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Transit-Advocates-Guide.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Transit Advocate Guide</u></a>, which takes you step-by-step through building a movement in your community. Transportation Alternatives also <a href="https://transalt.org/your-city-your-voice" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hosts occasional activist trainings</u></a> to help you learn how to organize successful campaigns in your neighborhood.
</p><h4>Don’t beat yourself up if you still do a lot of driving!
</h4><p>
	Maybe you bought an e-bike or a monthly metro pass … but you’ve been unable to quit your car the way you thought you would. That’s okay! This is 
	<em><em>not</em></em> an all-or-nothing activity. “Don’t feel guilty if you’re still driving,” Gordon stressed. Remember that “you’re operating within a system that is built for you to drive, so starting small is really good.” Every fit and start of progress helps.
</p><p>
	Remember also that better, low- and zero-emissions-friendly infrastructure and a pedestrian-first culture aren’t going to be built overnight. Even the most hard-core among us still need to use cars occasionally. Just “reimagining how we’re going to truly allocate our public resources — our public dollars, our public services — to serve everyone, and radically rethinking how to do that, is so important,” Sledge said.
</p><h4>
Become someone else’s bike geek
</h4><p>
	I will leave you with one last instruction for ditching your car. When you discover the bike that lets you “follow your joy, follow your bliss,” and puts a “smile on your face” — as Dean likes to say — don’t keep it to yourself.
</p><p>
	Someone else in your community is beginning to think about ditching their car, too. It’s 
	<em><em>your</em></em> turn now. Go forth. Become someone else’s enthusiastic bike geek.

## Eat Less Beef, Waste Less Food

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY1NzExOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODgxOTk3NX0.qnaJwbavZqpsOivIyJvNE6gtZsgRLWZfxaNsDxMBx_w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=9%2C0%2C391%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Let’s get this out of the way: You don’t have to turn vegetarian to make a meaningful dent in your carbon emissions. You don’t have to start <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/how-insects-positively-impact-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>eating insects</u></a> or experiment with <a href="https://brightgreenpartners.com/precision-fermentation-companies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>precision-fermented plant-based proteins</u></a>. You don’t even have to eat less meat, necessarily. Just eat less beef — or, if you prefer the idea of “more” to the idea of “less,” you could even say: Eat more chicken.
</p><p>
	Either way, the reason comes down to some of the simplest carbon accounting we have. Cows are, by far, our most carbon-intensive protein source. Every kilogram of beef produced in the U.S. emits about 38 kilograms of carbon from cradle to slaughterhouse, according to Gillett. Compare that to roughly 3.8 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of chicken, and even 4.9 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of pork, and you can start to see why even such a small change can have a big impact. A chicken needs to eat just 1.6 kilograms of feed to produce a kilogram of meat.
</p><p>
	“1.6 is basically magic, right?” Arthur Gillett, chief research officer at HowGood, an emissions research and data service for the food sector, told me. “Why are we messing with crickets?”
</p><p>
	Beyond that, though, the picture gets murkier. Because here’s the thing: Even if you wanted to track every single ounce of carbon related to your food intake, you couldn’t, at least not with any meaningful degree of accuracy. Of all the many systems operating in the global economy, the food system is perhaps the most complex, involving processes we’re still trying to understand, let alone track.
</p><p>
	For example: dirt. Essentially all the food we eat depends, at some point in its life cycle, on dirt. One reason beef is such a high-emission product is that it takes a lot of dirt to grow all the feed a typical cow eats over the course of its life — which runs to the thousands of pounds (including <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/50901500/px-based_v3.2/educ-matrls/pdfs/HO_what-cows-eat.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>byproducts</u></a> from other agricultural production) — plus a lot more to grow the cow itself. Even in the U.S., where cows are mostly finished on feedlots, livestock occupy <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2024/Census22_HL_FarmsFarmland.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>41% of available farmland</u></a>, but are raised on just 30% of farms. In Brazil, the world’s largest exporter of beef, where cows are mostly grass-fed, cattle graze on somewhere between 189 million and 253 million acres of what used to be the Amazon rainforest, depending on <a href="https://apnews.com/article/brazil-china-amazon-deforestation-beef-climate-trade-2a7a9a4310b6abca727dabb596e2e84d#:~:text=More%20than%20two%2Dthirds%20of%20deforested%20land%20in%20the%20Brazilian%20Amazon%20has%20been%20converted%20to%20cattle%20pastures%2C%20according%20to%20Brazil%E2%80%99s%20Ministry%20of%20Environment%20and%20Climate%20Change." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>whose</u></a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y6JHw_X1kzp_1QXlTCgg2U6gR2wTX70a/view" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimate</u></a> you use.
</p><p>
	But back to dirt: Climate scientists still don’t really understand how it works, from a carbon perspective. How much carbon is stored in the Earth’s soil? Estimates vary <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017GB005678" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pretty widely</u></a>, biogeochemist Rose Abramoff told me. How much is it emitting each year? That’s <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JG007637#:~:text=Soil%20respiration%20(Rs)%2C%20the%20soil%2Dto%2Datmosphere%20flux%20of%20CO2%2C%20is%20a%20dominant%20but%20uncertain%20part%20of%20the%20carbon%20cycle%2C%20even%20after%20decades%20of%20study." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>even less clear</u></a>. Does it make a difference whether that soil is planted with genetically modified soy versus heirloom squash? No idea.

	Until seven or eight years ago, it was accepted practice in the life-cycle analysis world to resolve these uncertainties by assuming soil-related emissions were stable and therefore marking them at zero, according to Gillett, “which is incredibly wrong,” he told me. Analyses are starting to be able to account for those emissions now, he said, but to be really meaningful, they would have to be recalculated every year. “So then every LCA, to be worth its salt, has to be a multi-year LCA. That’s impossible.” Gillett said.
</p><p>
	In other words, the science is very much still changing, and you could drive yourself crazy trying to keep up with it. These days, Gillett is excited about the potential for regenerative agriculture practices like no-till farming and co-locating livestock with crops to transform dairy into one of our most carbon-efficient sources of protein, he told me — something he never would have expected to say a year or two ago.
</p><p>
	Similarly, “Maybe 10 years ago, all of us were talking about food miles,” i.e. the distance from farm to table, according to Minnie Ringland, manager of climate and insights at ReFED, a food waste reduction advocacy group. You may have experienced this in the form of admonishments to “eat local.” Since then, however, cold storage supply chains have gotten a lot better, particularly in the Global South, which means that we’re losing a lot less food to spoilage — compared to the agricultural process itself, shipping represents a negligible portion of the emissions related to just about any given product.
</p><p>
	It's also important to remember that not all farming regions are created equal. California, for instance, is a great place to grow lots of things; Arizona, less so. “Depending on the geography where the food is being produced, it can be super intensive in terms of land use change, if land is being deforested in order to make way for agricultural fields or for grazing,” Ringland said. Another factor is the use of nitrogen fertilizer, which is both emissions-intensive to produce and generates carbon dioxide from its use, the environmental effects of fertilizer run-off on nearby land and waterways notwithstanding.
</p><p>
	That’s not to say there aren’t other important benefits to eating locally: contributing to your local economy, supporting biodiversity, encouraging holistic farming practices. The farmers at your weekend farmers market are a whole lot more likely to be practicing regenerative techniques and fertilizing with compost instead of industrial chemicals. But they’re also not going to be there at 7:48 p.m. on any given Tuesday when you’re midway through cooking a batch of chicken cacciatore and realize that you forgot the bell peppers.
</p><p>
	Speaking of compost, though, here’s a bonus trick to reduce your food-related carbon emissions: Collecting and composting your food scraps is good, but wasting less food is even better. The reason why is pretty obvious: Before it can be composted, food still has to go through the entire supply chain. And while composting food produces fewer emissions than landfilling food waste, it’s not an entirely emissions-free process, and can be more or less carbon-intensive depending on where and how it’s made. Reducing your food waste requires a bit more planning, but it will also save you money and send a more accurate demand signal down the farm-to-grocery-store supply chain.
</p><p>
	I could go on and on about things like the relative carbon impact of plant-based proteins and the emissions reduction potential of standardizing expiration dates on food labels, but all of that is still being worked out. If you <em><em>are</em></em> fake meat-curious, you can check out our guide on that <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/best-fake-meat" target="_blank">here</a>. And if you’re already a vegetarian or curious about it for reasons of health, ethics, etc., that’s great. The most important thing you, as a consumer, can do to reduce emissions from the food system is hold companies accountable for their carbon claims, which means not getting sucked into the stuff that sounds too good to be true. There’s plenty of delicious food out there that doesn’t take elaborate math to justify eating.
</p><p>
	So to recap: Eat less beef, waste less food. You can make it more complicated than that if you want, but everything else is gravy.

## Which Fake Meats Are Actually Good?

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0MjYyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MjY4NDAzNH0.qYAy_cf5N_mpj3OAeMRXUNcrNOXVrYtIMYzxuxAuXII/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=161%2C0%2C239%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	It was burrito night — I had some tortillas, salsa, guacamole and red onion in my refrigerator, but all our meat was still frozen, and I didn’t have any beans handy. So I did what any climate reporter with an interest in food systems would do and grabbed a pack of meatless “carne asada” I’d picked up out of curiosity and threw it into the mix. The end result was more “huh” than “wow,” but it held its own — with a little help from some hot sauce.
	<br/>
</p><p>
	Growing, raising, processing and transporting food is responsible for roughly a quarter of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, nearly 60% of which comes from meat production, 
	<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00358-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to one estimation</u></a>. If you're concerned about your personal carbon impact, eating less meat is probably on your to-do list. But what if you still like a carne asada burrito? Thankfully, there are plenty of companies working on satisfying your cravings, no animals involved.
</p><p>
	There are lots of other food system concerns that won’t make it into this guide — things like agricultural livelihoods, water use, and animal well-being. But if you’re curious about how fake meats work, what they taste like, and their emissions impact, here’s what you’ll want to know.
</p><h2>THE EXPERT PANEL</h2><p>
<em><strong><em>Ben Kelley</em></strong></em><strong>,</strong> owner and proprietor of Kelley Farms Kitchen, a vegan restaurant in Harpers Ferry, WV. Ben and his wife Sondra started Kelley Farms after going vegan themselves more than a decade ago. The cafe offers a mix of housemade and commercially available meat alternatives.
</p><p>
<em><strong><em>Ismael Montanez</em></strong></em>, the program manager at University of California Berkeley’s Alt Meat Lab, where he’s focused on food and sustainability broadly. He is co-founder and former CTO of plant-based lamb company Black Sheep Foods and eats both meat and plant-based replacements.
</p><p>
<em><strong><em>Andrea Cecchin</em></strong></em>, senior agriculture and carbon researcher at HowGood, a sustainability ratings company. Cecchin told me he and his family limit the amount of meat they eat but are focused on a wider plant based diet.
</p><h2>OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS</h2><ul>
<li><a href="#protein">Know your proteins</a>.<br/>
</li>
<li>Assess your <a href="#health">health needs</a> and limitations.</li>
<li>Take stock of your current diet and figure out <a href="#diet">what makes sense to replace</a>.</li>
<li>Maintain an <a href="#taste">open mind</a>.</li>
</ul><h2>THE BASICS</h2><ul>
<li>A food’s total carbon impact can be divided into four main areas: <strong>agriculture</strong>, <strong>processing</strong>, <strong>packaging</strong> and <strong>transportation</strong>, Cecchin told me. As a general rule, the largest part of any food’s impact is going to be in the agricultural phase. The processing stage, where food (e.g. wheat) is broken down into ingredients (e.g. flour) and/or processed with other foods to make a final product (e.g. bread), is “the other step where you can have quite some significant impacts.” Emissions at the processing stage are highly dependent on what kind of energy a business uses to power their processing, and how much energy they are using to do it, Cecchin said. In comparison, the packaging and transportation stage make up relatively small percentages of any food’s total impact.</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<h4 class="highlight-box-headline">What about eating local?</h4>
<p>
	There’s plenty of environmental and social benefits to eating locally, but climate impact isn’t generally one of them.
		</p>
<p>
	With the exception of high-value fresh commodities that need to be transported by air, like coffee or cocoa, transportation has a “very limited impact” on a final product’s emissions, Cecchin said. This especially holds true for meat — according to 
			<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one major study</a>, transportation made up a vanishingly small percentage of total meat-related emissions..
		</p>
<p>
	Transportation emissions may make up a higher percentage of the fruits’ and vegetables’ total impact, but the overall impact will still be far less than meat, whether you’re snacking on imported pineapple from the chain grocery store or an apple from your farmer’s market.
		</p>
<p>
	Packaging is a similar story. “Many low-impact single serving items can end up with packaging driving up to 50% of their emissions,” Arthur Gillett, chief research officer at HowGood, told me — but “these products still generally have a low overall emissions factor.”
		</p>
</div>
</div><ul>
<li>When it comes to the comparative size of foods’ emissions impact, <strong>beef cattle (and other grazing animals raised for meat, like goats and lamb), have the highest median greenhouse gas emissions</strong> per 100 kilograms of protein. Even compared to other animal products – pork, chicken, cheese, etc. — the difference is “massive,” Cecchin says. There are a couple reasons why:</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>A significant portion of beef’s emissions come from cows’ digestion. Cattle and other ruminants break down the grass and feed they eat by means of <strong>enteric fermentation</strong>, which in turn produces lots of methane, mostly in the form of burps, which are responsible for the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/09/22/company-plans-to-solve-cow-burps-and-reduce-methane-emissions/70925187007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>vast majority</u></a> of cow-related methane emissions. </li>
<li>Cattle are also “inefficient” compared to other protein sources, Cecchin explained, needing much more feed and/or grass (and thus land) to produce a pound of protein compared to other animals. This process also takes more time than other animals, increasing the total amount of methane released per cow, especially if what they’re eating is harder to digest. It makes beef an “obvious target” for any company pitching a plant-based alternative, Cecchin said. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Crops have their own carbon emissions, primarily from the use of <strong>nitrogen fertilizer</strong>, which is not only energy intensive to make, once it’s spread on fields it reacts with the soil to produce nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas that’s much more powerful than CO2. <strong>Deforestation</strong> drives additional carbon emissions — although much of deforestation is actually driven by crops grown for animal feed.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li class="rm-anchors" id="protein">Mock meats, cheese, eggs and seafood can be made from a wide variety of ingredients, but <strong>soy, wheat, </strong>and<strong> pea proteins</strong> are the cheapest and easiest to make at scale, Montanez told me. They’re also pretty flavor-neutral, which makes them easier to disguise as other things. “If you're making up a lamb flavor or a goat flavor or a pork flavor or a fish flavor, the protein source that you get might contribute to a little bit of umami,” Montanez added, but not enough to be distracting from the other ingredients. That’s especially important as the new batch of plant-based companies find taste is driving consumer’s decisions more than environmental impact, he said. “These products have to taste just as good, if not better, in order to have people switch over,” Montanez told me.<em> </em></li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Many companies use high-heat extrusion processes to <strong>texturize</strong> plant proteins, creating structures that replicate meat textures. That involves putting the raw material through “a lot of heat and pressure, forcing the proteins to align in strips, so it looks like muscle fiber,” Montanez explained. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Other companies produce fake meat via fermentation, in which fungi or mushrooms are inoculated in an organic growing medium (sometimes itself a food byproduct) and naturally grow similar fibrous structures. You’ll see it on food labels as <strong>mycelium, fungus, or mushrooms</strong> — this is how my burrito’s “carne asada” was made — and it’s used to build everything from chicken cutlets to <a href="https://juicymarbles.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ribs</u></a>. While this skips an expensive and energy-intensive extrusion step and can allow for more chewy or moist textures, Montanez said, it’s also slower to grow and less established commercially.</li>
</ul><div class="highlight-box">
<div class="highlight-box-inner">
<p>
			Confusingly, mushroom fermentation products cannot be called plant-based because fungi as a category are not considered plants. Go figure!
		</p>
</div>
</div><h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><h4>1. Does what I eat even matter for the climate?</h4><p>
	It’s a multi-trillion dollar question, frankly. While the worldwide food system is far more complex than individual consumer choices, shifts in demand for food products, especially among higher-income individuals, have created changes, such 
	<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/03/31/472453674/your-quinoa-habit-really-did-help-perus-poor-but-theres-trouble-ahead" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tripling the price of quinoa</u></a> during a boom in its popularity in mid-2010s. The U.S. and China’s growing middle classes also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/business/chinas-pork-demand-hits-a-peak-shocking-producers-as-diets-get-healthier-idUSKBN19A31C/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drove a spike in pork demand</u></a>, only to have that growth slow and reverse in the past few years over health concerns.
</p><h4>2. Is it safe to eat meat that’s grown in a lab?</h4><p>
	The plant-based meat alternatives currently available at your grocery store may be highly processed, but they’re different from the cultivated or “lab-grown” meat coming from a new batch of food companies that seek to “grow” meat from scratch on the cellular level. In theory, this would create direct replacements for things like steaks or fish without actually requiring us to raise actual animals. Almost all of these products are still in the research and development stage, however, and none are currently 
	<a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/upside-foods-cultivated-chicken-longer-served-calif-restaurant/707461/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>commercially available in the U.S</u></a>.
</p><h4>3. What if my burgers are labeled “carbon-neutral”?</h4><p>
	Let’s not mince words: 
	<strong>There is no such thing as carbon-neutral beef</strong>. How to reduce cattle’s climate impact is an area of active research, encompassing supplements and dietary changes, breeding programs to create animals that process food more efficiently, and even <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-21/these-face-masks-for-cows-have-nothing-to-do-with-coronavirus" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>methane-sucking gas masks</u></a>. There are also ranchers committed to using specific grazing techniques that encourage extra retention of soil carbon, thereby offsetting emissions from cows, but “the science is not there yet” on the scale of sequestration needed for fully carbon-neutral meat, Cecchin says. “Climate-friendly” or “low-carbon” meat labels have been criticized for a <a href="https://undark.org/2024/05/22/beef-climate-friendly-usda/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lack of data transparency</u></a> and only represent a 10% reduction in beef emissions overall.
</p><h2>BEFORE YOU GET STARTED </h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="diet">1. Consider the animal.</h4><p>
	The process of making plant-based mock meats is basically the reverse of their animal version, Montanez explained. While meat is made by processing animals into specific cuts or parts, plant-based replacements use protein-packed flours and other ingredients to build the “meat” back up.
</p><p>
	Almost all fake red meat products will have a smaller greenhouse gas impact than their animal versions, Cecchin explained. Compared to a beef burger, the alternatives “really bring down the carbon footprint — the amount of water we need to use, and the amount of land that we use” per unit of food. But for other products, the savings are less clear. Chicken, for instance, has a much lower footprint, meaning replacements have to compete against a “very efficient industry and a very efficient meat.”
</p><p>
	Processing details are rarely public, making it difficult to declare other meat replacements 
	<em><em>automatic</em></em> emissions winners. “It’s really company by company, and could even be year by year as processing efficiencies change,” Cecchin said, adding that he hopes more companies will show clear evidence of their total emissions, including being specific about what they are comparing against.
</p><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="health">2. Read the nutrition labels.</h4><p>
	Fake animal products are also not the same nutritionally as actual animal products, in ways that can be positive or negative depending on your specific dietary needs. An allergy to soy or wheat gluten would immediately knock out a good portion of these options, and my carne asada came with a warning to anyone “sensitive” to fungi.

<div class="highlight-author">Emily Pontecorvo</div></div></div></div></div><h2>HEATMAP RECOMMENDS</h2><h4>If you want the convenience of bulk frozen burger patties, go with <a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/products/burger" target="_blank">Impossible</a> or <a href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-GB/products/the-beyond-burger" target="_blank">Beyond burgers</a>.</h4><p>
	The experts all enjoyed the big-name beef replacements — Cecchin even said he has chosen Impossible and Beyond patties over regular burgers while eating out. If you have a little more time, though, Kelley said to skip the fast food fake burgers and make them yourself. Making good tasting meat replacements isn’t all that different from cooking meat itself: spices, technique and how it integrates into a meal makes all the difference. This is the case whether he’s using Impossible beef on the restaurant griddle or hand-making a black bean and chickpea patty. “Just like a raw piece of chicken,” he said, “it's about how you cook it.”
</p><h4>If you love a chicken sandwich, pick up <a href="https://www.gardein.com/chickn-and-turky/classics/ultimate-plant-based-spicy-chickn-filets" target="_blank">Gardein’s Chick’n filets</a>.</h4><p>
	Everyone I spoke to said most breaded chicken replacements match their animal versions pretty well — Montanez even called them “most consistently tasty” than their actual meat equivalents, which for him was enough to justify the slight additional cost. He said he thinks Impossible’s chicken nuggets are the “most convincing” — although he also cautioned that he doesn’t eat a lot of breaded meat products in the first place.
</p><p>
	Morningstar Farms’ Chik Patty has been a go-to at-home lunch in my house for nearly three decades, primarily because of that consistency and ease of preparation. (The “buffalo” flavor is by far the best, in my opinion.) Kelley uses Gardein’s Chick’n on one of their most popular sandwiches at the restaurant — they’re a big fan of the company and product.
</p><p>
	Don’t expect a lot of options for raw chicken alternatives, however. Montanez suspects the economics of competing with relatively cheap meat isn’t attractive to companies, especially when prepared breaded versions, both animal and plant-based, are already popular.
</p><blockquote>
<em><em><strong>“</strong></em></em><em><em><strong>Emulating the flavor of American chicken is relatively easy and shouldn't be seen as a significant achievement,” Montanez said. “What’s truly interesting is creating a versatile analog that can withstand the same cooking conditions as real chicken.”</strong></em></em>
</blockquote><h4>If you’re tailgating, get the <a href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/en-GB/products/beyond-sausage?variant=brat-original" target="_blank">Beyond Sausage Brat Original</a>.</h4><p>
	Kelley’s favorite meat replacement is Beyond’s bratwurst sausage, made with pea protein and avocado oil. He uses it in a variety of meals at his cafe, as well as to grill up at home, sometimes adding it to pasta.
</p><h4>If you must have a plant-based steak, try <a href="https://juicymarbles.com/?srsltid=AfmBOooVq4O4du0eHoalzN4l7KKvZc7rNVfspJ1N4L-DuvsqmdVeYPK_" target="_blank">Juicy Marbles</a>.</h4><p>
	Steak and other meats that include marbled fats have been a particularly tricky nut to crack for fake meat producers
	<strong> </strong>because the traditional extrusion process makes it difficult to capture fat alongside protein. Montanez told me <a href="https://juicymarbles.com/collections/all-products" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Juicy Marbles</u></a> has developed a process capable of doing both, which it’s used to create filet and loin products.
</p><h4>If you’re trying to make the perfect vegan BLT, you might be out of luck (unless you live in Berkeley).</h4><p>
	Montanez’s favorite fake bacon is only available in 
	<a href="https://www.thebutchersveganson.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a vegan deli in Berkeley, California</u></a>, but generally both he and Kelley haven’t found full bacon strips that really match the experience of eating bacon. “There's no way to hold it after you cook it without it drying out,” Kelley said. Instead, he likes using soy [bacon] crumbles in various dishes, including in his potato salad.
</p><h4>If you’re putting together a charcuterie board, you want <a href="https://thevreamery.com/product/prime-roots-brand-koji-pepperoni/" target="_blank">Prime Roots Koji Pepperoni</a>.</h4><p>
	The pepperoni and other fermented charcuterie from Prime Roots is “quite impressive, even from a meat eater’s perspective,” Montanez told me. The company starts its process with koji, a strain of fungus that has been part of Japanese cuisine for hundreds of years, including in the product of soy sauces and sake.
</p><h4>If you’re building a stacked sandwich, go with <a href="https://tofurky.com/" target="_blank">Tofurky</a>.</h4><p>
	The deli slices Kelley uses in sandwiches like reubens or Italian hoagies are made with seitan or a mix of seitan and soy, from a variety of companies. But the 
	<a href="https://tofurky.com/what-we-make/deli-slices/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Tofurky</u><u> brand</u></a> (not just turkey) is one of their favorites. “We are always testing new recipes of our own and using reliable and ethical companies that we grew up loving,” he said.
</p><h4>If you’re craving a lobster roll, you might be on your own.</h4><p>
	Kelley
	<strong> </strong>has yet to be convinced by most seafood replacements, he told me. “All the seafood is kind of just the same as the chicken replacements,” he said. Instead, he uses unripe jackfruit – a common meat replacement with a stringy texture – hearts of palm, and spices to replicate crab cakes. Having an exact match isn’t always a priority for Kelley, who’d rather highlight an ingredient that serves as a replacement rather than calling it by its faux name. His lobster roll replacement is made with hearts of palm, but it’s not “vegan lobster” on his menu, it’s a “hearts of palm” roll.
</p><p>
	Texture is a “very difficult thing in seafood,” Montanez said. “I haven't seen anything myself where it is 100% convincing,” but he points out companies like 
	<a href="https://impact.food/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Impact Food</u></a> that are making plant-based sushi without extrusion or fermentation, currently available in some New York and California restaurants.
</p><h4>If you’re making a sauce for your vegan buffalo wings, use <a href="https://climax.bio/" target="_blank">Climax Foods’ blue cheese</a>.</h4><p>
	Montanez also called out vegan cheese as a category that struggles to match its original, citing texture, not flavor, as the sticking point, especially when it needs to work in a multitude of different recipes. “You might see a vegan cheese that’s okay applied in pieces,” he said, “but it's only as good if you put it in pizza oven temperatures.” An exception to the rule for him is Climax Foods’ blue cheese, which almost pulled off a 
	<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2024/04/27/vegan-cheese-good-food-awards-climax/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Judgment of Paris-like upset in a food competition</u></a> this year before being removed from the running.
</p><h4>If you want a no-meat picnic full of protein, sample the various offerings from <a href="https://www.quorn.co.uk/" target="_blank">Quorn</a>.</h4><p>
	Montanez identified Quorn as a brand that’s not trying to replicate meat exactly, but tastes good on its own. The British company has a wide range of no-meat products that feel like they could have a home in a Tesco, from a vegan Yorkshire ham to mini sausage rolls to “picnic eggs.”
</p><h2>WHAT’S NEXT?<br/>
</h2><h4 class="rm-anchors" id="taste">1. It’s all a matter of taste.</h4><p>
	Approaches to fake meat taste fall on a spectrum. On one end are companies that try to replicate as closely as possible the taste, texture, and smell of some specific meat product — say, a chicken nugget. (Your personal mileage may vary when it comes to replicas of more complicated meat cuts such as steaks or pork chops.) On the other end are brands that offer a functional, hopefully flavorful replacement for meat in a meal but otherwise aren’t trying to fool anyone.
</p><p>
	The former approach involves more materials science and chemistry, Montanez told me. For example, Impossible makes a soy version of a key molecule in meat known as heme and combines it with a carefully calibrated proportion of sugars, fats, and water to induce the Maillard reaction, the process that makes meat brown and form a crust. It’s possible to create a similar meaty flavor profile without heme (Impossible has a patent on their version), but they have their own complications.
</p><blockquote>
<em><strong>“It’s those sugars reacting with the proteins and creating these molecules that ultimately result in a meaty aroma or flavor,” Montanez said.</strong></em>
</blockquote><p>
	Kelley Farm’s menu is a good example of the wider ingredient possibilities of meat replacements beyond this approach. In addition to Impossible patties, Beyond brats, and Gardein’s Chick’n, the restaurant also serves deli meat replacements made with seitan (basically textured wheat gluten); folded eggs made from mung beans; BBQ pulled pork made from jackfruit, which mimics that stringy texture naturally (I’ve had both Kelley Farms’ barbeque sandwich and commercial jackfruit BBQ versions and would happily eat either again); and a burger patty that’s their own mix of chickpeas and black beans.
</p><h4>2. Don’t overcomplicate it.</h4><p>
	It’s also worth noting that there is a more literal approach to eating a plant-based diet that’s already the standard in many other countries — that is, rather than replacing meat products with fake meat products, just eat more plants. If you feel like you’re missing out on protein, beans, lentils, tofu, and certain grains like quinoa, farro or teff, have high amounts.
</p><p>
	Highly engineered meat substitutes are often more expensive than the animal products they are replacing, so if you’re struggling with hunger, have specific dietary requirements, anxiety around food, or an eating disorder, concerns about emissions shouldn’t even enter the picture.
</p><p>
	For that matter, just reorienting your approach to eating meat saves a lot of carbon on its own. Kelley told me he reaches for meat replacements when he’s craving something specific, while Cecchin prefers meat alternatives when he’s eating out.

## Soyuz capsule with 2 Russians, 1 American from ISS returns to Earth

date: 2024-09-23, from: VOA News USA

Moscow — A Soyuz capsule carrying two Russians and one American from the International Space Station landed Monday in Kazakhstan, ending a record-breaking stay for the Russian pair.


The capsule landed on the Kazakh steppe about 3 1/2 hours after undocking from the ISS in an apparently trouble-free descent. In the last stage of the landing, it descended under a red-and-white parachute at about 7.2 meters per second (16 mph), with small rockets fired in the final seconds to cushion the touchdown.


The astronauts were extracted from the capsule and placed in nearby chairs to help them adjust to gravity, then given medical examinations in a nearby tent.


Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub returned after 374 days aboard the space station; on Friday they broke the record for the longest continuous stay there. Also in the capsule was American Tracy Dyson, who was in the space station for six months.


Eight astronauts remain in the space station, including Americans Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have remained long past their scheduled return to Earth.


They arrived in June as the first crew of Boeing's new Starliner capsule. But their trip was marred by thruster troubles and helium leaks, and the U.S. space agency NASA decided it was too risky to return them on Starliner.


The two astronauts are to ride home with SpaceX next year.

## Want to Decarbonize Your Community? Here’s How.

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY0NTk0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTQ4MzM1Nn0.y243curgbkAh-dsdx8vNolnl7kG41fHG2vzQpwn37FU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=208%2C0%2C192%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
<a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/how-to-drive-less" target="_blank">Driving less</a> has a lot of benefits. You’ll be healthier than your vehicle-bound peers, about 
	<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a4.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a third</u></a> of whom don’t walk for more than 10 minutes a week. You’ll cut carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane emissions. In the process, you’ll probably realize how awful America’s public and active transportation infrastructure is — and may want to do something about it.
</p><p>
	The same goes for just about any action you’ll find in Heatmap’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life" target="_blank">guide to decarbonizing your life</a>. Should it be easier to get a permit to install rooftop solar panels? For sure. Should there be more public chargers to support EV adoption in your community? Without a doubt.
</p><p>
	It can be especially overwhelming to think about getting involved in your local political processes when it comes to mobility because the cards are stacked so heavily in drivers’ favor. But it’s far from impossible. Here’s Heatmap’s guide to advocating for better transportation options and infrastructure in your community.
</p><h3>Pick a project</h3><p>
	This might be the hardest step of all. To take transportation as an example, most American cities and towns were literally constructed to get drivers from point A to point B as fast as possible — meaning that their design is often actively hostile to anyone who wants to walk, bike, or take mass transit instead. If you put your mind to it, you could probably devise a dozen ways to make your immediate neighborhood friendlier to carless commuters.
</p><p>
	Transportation for America’s 
	<a href="https://t4america.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Transit-Advocates-Guide.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>transit advocate guide</u></a> has several suggested starting places, including advocating for additional late-night service on a particular bus route, improving access to transit stations or stops (known as first- or last-mile connectivity), and pushing for shuttle services to connect riders with jobs. Petitioning for something like a bike lane, new sidewalk, safer intersections, or a missing crosswalk is another good place to start.
</p><p>
	“Focus on one individual project,” Alexa Sledge, the communications director at 
	<a href="https://transalt.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Transportation Alternatives</u></a>, a New York City nonprofit promoting non-polluting, safe, and quiet travel, told me. Being clear and focused on what you want — and, importantly, not getting overwhelmed or pulled in multiple directions — will help you achieve your goal. <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Strong Towns</u></a>, a nonprofit that supports transportation advocates, calls this step the “<a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/9/23/the-strong-towns-approach-to-public-investment-satbook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>humble observation</u></a>:” identifying where people are struggling in your community and zeroing in on the smallest first possible step to help.

	Here’s the excellent news: You aren’t in this fight alone.
</p><p>
	Pretty much every major city and metropolitan region in the U.S. has its own transportation advocacy group these days, and you’re potentially just a 
	<a href="https://gprivate.com/6d69i" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Google search away</u></a> from locating yours. (If you can’t find a transportation-specific group, look into local climate or pedestrian organizations, which frequently have overlapping objectives.)
</p><p>
	It’s important to link up with others not just because they might already have identified priority projects in your area. Advocating for structural change requires, by definition, allies — and unfortunately, car-centricity is so dominant that transit advocates are often forced to prove 
	<a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/03/05/all-the-ways-that-cars-harm-our-communities-well-almost-all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the obvious community benefits</u></a> of things like better bus routes or protected bike lanes.
</p><p>
	If you don’t live in an area with an active transit group, nationwide organizations like 
	<a href="https://t4america.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Transportation for America</u></a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=33.49079918747068%2C-105.9230887175832&z=4&mid=12VM4_wScJ36-EnEXQh-wN08xOK57tuw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Strong Towns</u></a> can connect with to get the tools, resources, <a href="https://transalt.org/your-city-your-voice" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>training</u></a>, and advice you need to start gathering allies.

<strong>How do I change a zoning law? Or weigh in on a renewable energy project near me?</strong>
</p>
<p>
			Maybe you’re reading this guide because you’re interested in advocating 
			<a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/zoning-for-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate-conscious zoning reform</u></a> or want to weigh in on a wind farm nearby. There is a “<a href="https://www.nahro.org/journal_article/rethinking-zoning-to-increase-affordable-housing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>profound diversity</u></a>” of processes to do so from municipality to municipality, and no one-size-fits-all approach. That’s why it’s extra important to get involved with a local advocacy group; veteran organizers in your area can help you navigate the labyrinthine processes of your specific local government.
		</p>
<p>
			That said, here are a few things to keep your eyes peeled for:
		</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Comment Periods. </strong>A comment period typically lasts 30 to 60 days and is conducted by the overseeing public agency (for example, <a href="https://cdxapps.epa.gov/cdx-enepa-II/public/action/eis/search?search=&__fsk=91041499#results" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> is the EPA’s database of environmental impact statements that are currently open for public comments). Public comment periods for large developments typically happen during <a href="https://www.epa.gov/nepa/how-citizens-can-comment-and-participate-national-environmental-policy-act-process" target="_blank">the scoping process</a>, following a Notice of Intent published in the Federal Register.</li>
<li><strong>Metropolitan Planning Organizations</strong> help oversee how federal transportation funds get used regionally. They can be structured in different ways but generally they’re run by elected officials. Getting in touch with your MPO representative can be powerful because, as<a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2024/06/24/get-to-know-your-mpo-a-sustainable-transportation-advocates-guide-to-one-of-americas-most-critical-agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Streetsblog writes</a>, “you’ll likely catch them by surprise and find them more receptive to strategic pressure than expected.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Typically, <strong>state legislators</strong> need to <a href="https://nextcity.org/urbanist-news/how-to-reform-zoning-allow-more-density-transit-oriented-housing-seattle" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">write new laws</a> to change things like existing zoning regulations. Learn who represents you and tell them what you think about plans in your city or town — and organize locally to campaign for candidates who would advance your goals.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><h3>Let your elected officials know you care about transit</h3><p>
	There is an old urban planning joke about how traffic woes could be fixed by adding 
	<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/14r8d1g/just_one_more_lane/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just one more lane</u></a>. (They can’t be). Alas, this is also something of a federal policy; even though the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law set aside $36 billion to “transform our transportation system,” many states used their flexible funds for <a href="https://nysfocus.com/2024/02/05/biden-infrastructure-law-highways-public-transit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>things like widening roads</u></a>. Mass and active transit are often only an afterthought when it comes to funding: the Capital Investment Grants Program, one of the most significant federal programs for transit, is on the chopping block every budget-writing session, and programs like the Highway Trust Fund <a href="https://enotrans.org/article/explainer-what-the-80-20-highway-transit-split-really-is-and-what-it-isnt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>puts as little as 13%</u></a> toward mass transit.
</p><p>
	It’s our elected officials who make these decisions, though — and it’s their job to listen to their constituents. Here’s 
	<a href="https://www.apta.com/advocacy-legislation-policy/advocacy/contact-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a handy page</u></a> for determining the relevant senators and representatives to contact about federal funding for transit and active mobility policies; for local projects, you’ll want to reach out to your city council members, whose names and email addresses or phone numbers you should be able to find on your city website. And if you feel you’re getting brushed off by city staff when you reach out, focus on the smallest possible steps forward and be persistent (you can learn more strategies <a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/8/18/the-technical-brush-off-and-how-to-fight-it" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>).
</p><h3>Make a public comment</h3><p>
	The truth is, most people don’t go to their city council meetings. “When you really get down to the local level, there often aren’t as many people fighting, so you really can make a big difference,” Sledge said. Speaking up at hearings, town halls, public comment periods, or city council meetings can result in significant change and progress.
</p><p>
	But let’s face it: Because most of us don’t have experience in local activism, telling someone to “go to a city council meeting” is much easier said than done. “The thing to remember is that your city council members work for you,” Sledge said. “They are elected members of your government, and you vote for them, and they are paid with taxpayer money. It’s part of their job to listen to you.”
</p><p>
	Doug Gordon, the cohost of <a href="https://thewaroncars.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em>The War on Cars</em></u></a>, a podcast about the fight against car culture, also suggested taking some of the pressure off yourself. “Don’t feel like you have to give the rousing patriotic speech in defense of the neighborhood bike lane,” he told me. “Just go and listen, and maybe if all that’s asked of you is to raise your hand when they ask how many people support this project, and that’s all you do, great.”
</p><p>
	You don’t necessarily need to show up at a town council meeting or a representative’s office, either. Sledge suggested taking smaller steps like a phone call or email, or even just talking to people in your immediate community (for example, if you want a crosswalk outside your kid’s school, start by talking to the school board or other parents). When approaching someone like your city counselor, use language like: “This crosswalk is really important to me. How do I get this done?”

<h4 class="highlight-box-headline"><strong>A Step-By-Step Guide to Making a Public Comment</strong></h4>
<p>
	1. Depending on the project you’re pursuing, look up when your local transportation authority is inviting public comments (
			<a href="https://new.mta.info/transparency/board-and-committee-meetings/how-to-comment" target="_blank">here’s an example</a> of what that page looks like in New York City). You can also search for when your state is holding public transportation hearings (here’s <a href="https://www.okhouse.gov/committees/house/trans" target="_blank">what Oklahoma’s looks like</a>) and contact the relevant representatives to express your views. Most likely, though, you’ll be looking for your town’s public meeting schedule (<a href="https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/departments-offices/transportation/policies/vehicle-miles-traveled-metric/public-meetings-schedule" target="_blank">here’s an example</a> of San Jose’s) and seeking <strong>a special session</strong> related to transportation or a <strong>regular business meeting</strong>. Virtual hearings have also been common since the pandemic.
		</p>
<p>
<span></span>2. Research beforehand to learn how to comment publicly in your city or town. This may involve <strong>signing up</strong> on the town’s website or on a sign-in sheet when you arrive at the hearing.
		</p>
<p>
<span></span>3. In most cases, during <strong>the public comment portion</strong> of the city council meeting, you can address the council on any public issue (it does not have to be on the agenda). Again, check your city or town’s website to learn the specifics of procedures. Also, be aware of <strong>the time limit </strong>for your comments; generally, you’ll have about three minutes.
		</p>
<p>
<span></span><strong>When you’re called on</strong>:
		</p>
<ul>
<li>State your full name and any brief, relevant details, like the neighborhood you live in or the transit advocacy group you’re associated with.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.re-sources.org/meetings/making-effective-public-comments/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Give a one-sentence “ask”</a> for what you want from the council.</li>
<li>Add supporting details — <a href="https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/2023-APTA-Storytelling-Guide.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tell your story</a>. Why is this important to you? How will it benefit others in your community? When you can, back up statements with data (the American Public Transportation Association has <a href="https://www.apta.com/" target="_blank">a toolbox full of handy stats</a>).</li>
<li>Restate your “ask” in conclusion.</li>
<li>Thank your representatives.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	During your comment, you will probably see a timer somewhere in the room to help you track how long you have left to speak. The best comments are short and concise. Even if you’re frustrated with the process, be polite; remember that your comment can be seen and cited by anyone, including the media. Speak slowly. Here’s

## How Heatmap’s Staff Decarbonizes Their Lives

date: 2024-09-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzY1MTEyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTM2ODc5NH0.EIg3W9qdoX8QgBhy4imK1P0jFynKdj9cDE4npOB6Mh8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=200%2C0%2C200%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	As a renter in a walkable city, I can’t get heat pumps or solar panels and don’t need an EV. The main thing I try to do is buy used. There’s so many vintage, consignment, and thrift stores, online used clothing and furniture marketplaces, and even name-brand businesses that recycle old styles and models that you can find basically anything you want. Yearning for a pair of Lululemon leggings or in need of a basic black J.Crew blazer? Check Poshmark or Depop, where someone is inevitably giving away theirs for a discount. Facebook Marketplace is a goldmine for chairs, desks, lamps, toasters, fans, air conditioners, and so much more. If you’re in search of a couch or dresser that you need delivered, try AptDeco. Searching for used clothing and furniture takes time and effort, and can make me feel crazy. But fast fashion and furniture are a scourge of the Earth, and this is my best effort at resistance. — <em>Emily</em>
</p><p>
	I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again -- I fully endorse buying a used Chevy Bolt. With its estimated 259 miles of range and its zippy acceleration, there is no better bang for your buck if you’re considering an electric vehicle. Plus, you can score a federal (and sometimes state-level) rebate on the purchase if you meet certain income requirements. Factoring in incentives, it’s possible to nab one for <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chevy-bolt-used-range-price-value-chevrolet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">about $12,000</a> in certain states. Sure, it’s not a head-turner, nor is it the fastest to charge, but you’d be hard pressed to find a better deal when buying an electric vehicle. — <em>Mike</em>
</p><p>
	The internet overlords knew that I had been reporting on plastic waste and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/15/recycling-plastics-producers-report" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">myth of plastic recycling</a> a few years back and bombarded me for months with perfectly targeted Instagram ads for <a href="https://www.blueland.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Blueland</a>. Eventually I caved and bought its reusable hand soap bottle and soap tablets (and eventually a number of other cleaning products, too). You can order new dissolvable tablets on a recurring or one-off basis, thereby avoiding buying and disposing of single-use plastic products every time you need more soap, detergent, or surface cleaner. Lest you need reminding, plastics are made from natural gas and crude oil, so even though you might not see emissions spewing out of your disposable dish soap bottle, know that there is indeed a better way. — <em>Katie</em>
</p><p>
<span></span>We live in an older apartment that, unfortunately, does not have central air, and we haven’t yet sprung for a heat pump. Upon moving in last year, however, we replaced our old, drafty living room windows with double-pane windows, and the ancient window unit with a <a href="https://www.midea.com/us/air-conditioners/window-air-conditioners/8000-btu-u-shaped-air-conditioner-maw08v1qwt" target="_blank">Midea U-shaped air conditioner</a>. Our area is relatively dense and our apartment is across the street from a fire station, so in this case our pursuit of energy efficiency hasn't just improved our carbon footprint, but also our quality of life in terms of noise. — <em>Matthew</em>
</p><p>
	I did my first <a href="https://veganuary.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Veganuary</a> in 2021, while quarantining at my parents’ house (because there’s no time like a global pandemic to completely upheave your lifestyle). I’ve been a vegetarian for almost 20 years and have <a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/the-complicated-case-for-pollotarianism" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">never eaten red meat</a>, so I’d been pretty confident that going 31 days without using any animal products would be a piece of (plant-based) cake. <em>Wrong</em>. I was humbled by the challenge — and awakened to how much dairy and eggs I consume without even realizing it. Ever since then, I’ve been far more intentional about using ingredients like cheese and butter only when I <em>really</em> need them; my husband and I haven’t had cow milk in our fridge in years because we don’t mind the substitutes. That’s the thing about diet: While eating plant-rich meals is one of the highest-impact things an individual can do to reduce their emissions, it truly <a href="https://heatmap.news/decarbonize-your-life/food-emissions" target="_blank">doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing endeavor</a>. Believe me, I still love cheese — but now I also know that vegan butter makes the best chocolate chip cookies. — <em>Jeva</em></p><p>When my wife and I were in college, we became vegetarians together; we did it for reasons that involved animal welfare, personal health, and, somewhat embarrassingly, the fact that I got really into Daniel Quinn’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40611328-ishmael" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em>Ishmael</em></u></a>. For the two of us, habit-shifting environmental concerns were not yet in the mix. Many years have since passed, and though we still don’t eat meat, those once-distant concerns have taken center stage, and on the rare occasion that we’re asked why we’re vegetarians, the state of the environment has become our first response. Though it now feels almost passive, avoiding meat <u>remains</u> one of the most significant ways that we — my wife and me, and also all of us — can reduce our emissions, and now that we’re parents, it feels like a valuable lesson that we’ve passed on to the next generation of lentil aficionados. — <em>Jacob</em></p><p>
	When you use toilet paper from one of the big tissue brands, you are literally wiping your ass with a 100-year-old  tree — so deeply is this seared into my brain that I could have sworn I’d read it word for word in the Natural Resources Defense Council’s inaugural <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/issue-tissue-how-americans-are-flushing-forests-down-toilet-report.pdf" target="_blank">“Issue With Tissue” report</a>, but when I search the text, it’s nowhere to be found. In any case, the message stands: As recently as last year, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/2023-09/issue-with-tissue-5th-report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">all three</a> of the major U.S. tissue manufacturers — Kimberly-Clark, Procter & Gamble, and Georgia-Pacific — still made their toilet tissue and paper towels exclusively from virgin forests, which is simply not something I can live with. In my house, we use <a href="https://www.seventhgeneration.com/bathroom-tissue-2-ply" target="_blank">Seventh Generation Extra Soft & Strong</a>, made from 100% recycled paper pulp and treated with non-chlorine bleach. But things are beginning to change! The <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/issue-tissue" target="_blank">sixth edition report</a> came out last week, showing that two out of the Big Three have improved their options and practices. — <em>Jillian</em></p>

Muslims account for less than 2% of the U.S. population, but as VOA’s Kane Farabaugh reports, Muslim American influence in U.S. elections is growing, driven largely by concerns over the continued war between Israel and Hamas.

The event, which corresponds with the 79th United Nations General Assembly, is expected to draw some 100,000 people – including entrepreneurs, financiers, CEOs, diplomats, scientists, and creatives – to discuss climate solutions. More than 900 events are planned all over the city.

The vote was 215 to 191, with eight Democrats joining 207 Republicans in support. But the bill is very unlikely to get past the Senate, and will face a veto if it somehow makes it to President Biden’s desk. The EPA <a href="https://www.epa.gov/regulations-emissions-vehicles-and-engines/final-rule-multi-pollutant-emissions-standards-model?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lrG9io4H0rEFk9k_etFEussONLg0E_C_aUHqNDz5Xe5b_sxMSN8Gi18i5tpxCkKpy4XUf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">estimates</a> that the rules could see EVs make up anywhere between 30% and 56% of new light-duty sales from model years 2030 to 2032, and avoid more than 7 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions and provide nearly $100 billion of annual net benefits to society by improving public health, and reducing fuel and maintenance costs for drivers.</p><h3>4. New report spotlights where net zero targets are falling short</h3><p>More than 40% of “non-state entities” – that is, major companies, regions, and cities – do not have targets in place for curbing greenhouse gas emissions, according to <a href="https://ca1-nzt.edcdn.com/Reports/Net_Zero_Stocktake_2024.pdf?v=1726833981&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lrG9io4H0rEFk9k_etFEussONLg0E_C_aUHqNDz5Xe5b_sxMSN8Gi18i5tpxCkKpy4XUf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new report</a> from Net Zero Tracker. The group’s annual stocktake examines net zero targets “across all countries, states, regions in the largest 25-emitting countries in the world, all cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants, and the largest 2,000 publicly listed companies in the world.” It found that, while more net zero targets are being made, many of these fall short on integrity measures, like providing clarity on the use of offsets, covering all emissions scopes, annual progress reporting, and having a published implementation plan. Among the major companies that do not yet have a mitigation target are Tesla, Nintendo, and Berkshire Hathaway.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Alleged Trump gunman wrote of 'assassination attempt,' prosecutors say

date: 2024-09-23, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, Florida — The man accused of hiding out with a gun near Donald Trump's Florida golf course in an apparent bid to kill the former president wrote a letter months earlier describing an "assassination attempt" and offering a bounty on Trump's life, U.S. prosecutors said on Monday.


Ryan Routh, 58, has been charged with two gun crimes after he allegedly pointed a rifle through the tree line on Sept. 15 while the Republican presidential candidate was playing golf at his course in West Palm Beach, according to a criminal complaint. He has not yet entered a plea.


Routh is due to appear at a hearing scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) on Monday in which prosecutors where will ask a judge to keep him in jail until his trial. In a court filing released before the hearing, prosecutors said that several months prior to the incident, Routh dropped off a handwritten letter addressed to "the world" that offered a bounty on Trump.


"This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you," the suspect wrote, according to the filing. "I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job."


The letter was found in a box handed over by an unidentified civilian witness that also included ammunition, a metal pipe and four phones, prosecutors said.


Prosecutors also said that when Routh was arrested this month his car contained a handwritten list of dates in August, September and October of places where Trump had appeared or was expected to appear. They said a search of his cellphone records showed that the devices had pinged towers near the Trump International golf course where the incident took place and by the Mar-a-Lago resort where Trump lives.




Routh has been charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. More charges could follow.


A U.S. Secret Service agent spotted the weapon and fired in Routh's direction, causing the suspect to flee, according to the complaint. Routh was later arrested along a Florida highway. U.S. officials have said Routh did not fire a shot during the encounter at the golf course and did not have a line of sight to Trump, who was a few hundred meters away.


Authorities have not yet divulged a motive for the incident, which the FBI has said is being investigated as an apparent attempted assassination of Trump ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.




It came about two months after another gunman wounded Trump on the ear during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. That gunman was shot and killed by the Secret Service. The pair of incidents revealed the agency's strains at a time of rising political threats and violence in the United States.


Routh, a struggling roofing contractor who most recently lived in Hawaii, had a criminal history. He was a vocal supporter of Ukraine who was interviewed about his quixotic effort to recruit Afghans to fight against Russia's invasion.


In a 2023 self-published book, Routh wrote that Iran was "free to assassinate Trump" for pulling the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Teheran during his presidency.


In December 2002, Routh was convicted in North Carolina of possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction. He was also convicted of possessing stolen goods in 2010, according to court records.


Cellphone data showed that Routh may have been waiting in the area for nearly 12 hours - from around 2 a.m. until about 1:30 p.m. - when the gun was spotted, according to the criminal complaint. Investigators found a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope, a digital camera and a plastic bag with food at the scene, according to the complaint.

## High inflation memories cloud US consumers' outlooks

date: 2024-09-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Even before the Federal Reserve approved its outsized half-percentage-point interest rate cut last week, financial markets had begun making credit cheaper for households and businesses as they bid down mortgage rates, cut corporate bond yields, and chipped away at what consumers pay for personal, auto and other loans.


How fast that process will continue now that the U.S. central bank's first rate cut is in the books is unclear, in particular whether easing credit conditions will become tangible to consumers in ways that shift attitudes about the economy before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.




Recent surveys suggest that while the pace of price increases has declined dramatically, the public's mood is still marred by nearly two years of high inflation — even if falling rates signal that chapter of recent economic history is closed and will begin making it cheaper for people to borrow money.


"My daughter has been trying to buy a home for years and cannot," said Julie Miller, who works at her son's electrical company in Reno, Nevada, a state where home prices rose fast during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of seven key battleground states in the presidential race, Nevada is being aggressively contested by Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican challenger.


If housing costs are vexing Miller's daughter, higher prices at Taco Bell have caused Miller to cut back on the usual Friday night trips to the fast food retailer with her granddaughter, and left her inclined to vote for Trump because "I don't think Biden has done a great job with inflation."


Harris supporters had similar concerns about high prices even as they vouched for her as the best candidate to address the problem.


Borrowing costs decline


The Fed's rate cut on Sept. 18 is likely to be followed by more, with at least another quarter-percentage-point reduction expected when policymakers begin their next two-day policy meeting a day after the U.S. election.




Just as rate increases feed through to a higher cost of credit for families and businesses, discouraging them from borrowing, spending and investing in order to cool inflation, reductions in borrowing costs change the calculus for would-be homebuyers and firms, particularly small businesses wanting to finance new equipment or expand production.


Looser monetary policy, which the Fed had been signaling was on the way, has already put money back into people's pockets. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate home mortgage, the most popular home loan, for example, is approaching 6% after nearing 8% just a year ago. Redfin, a real estate firm, recently estimated that the median payment on homes sold or listed in the four weeks through Sept. 15 was $300 less than the all-time high hit in April and nearly 3% lower than a year ago.


But with that adjustment already done, "mortgage rates are likely to remain relatively stable for the next couple of weeks," Chen Zhao, an economist at Redfin, wrote in a post on the company's website.


Indeed, under baseline estimates from the Fed's own staff, mortgage rates are likely to level off somewhere in the mid-5% range, meaning most of the relief there has already occurred.


Banks have begun trimming the "prime rate" they charge their most credit-worthy borrowers to match the Fed rate cut. Other forms of consumer credit - the auto and personal loans where a better deal might be available to households - have changed only marginally so far, and it may take longer for banks to give up on charging higher finance costs.


Investors and economists saw last week's rate cut as less important than the message it carried of a central bank ready to loosen credit and confident that recent high inflation won't recur.


Inflation in fact has registered one of its fastest ever declines, with the consumer price index's annual increase falling from more than 9% in June 2022 to 2.6% on a year-over-year basis last month. The Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index rose at a 2.5% rate in July, near the central bank's 2% target.




Sour sentiment


The U.S. economy has been performing reasonably well despite concerns the job market might be on the brink of weakening.


New claims for unemployment benefits remain low and unexpectedly fell in the most recent week, while the unemployment rate, at 4.2% in August, has risen from a year ago but is around the level the Fed feels is sustainable without generating excess wage and price pressures. A Philadelphia Fed index of manufacturing rose recently and retail sales for August grew despite expectations for a drop.


But none of that has led to a decisive shift in public sentiment.


The share of Americans who see the economy as heading in the right direction climbed to 25% in August from 17% in May 2022, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Yet the share that sees the economy on the wrong track has eased to 60% from 74% over the same period.


A New York Fed survey that through early this year showed people feeling better off than a year ago and expecting more improvement in the year ahead has since been moving in the other direction even as inflation slowed further and rate cuts became more likely.


The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index had been improving but then dropped in recent months and remains below where it was before the pandemic.


The most recent U.S. Census "pulse" polls of households showed the share who reported trouble paying household expenses in the past week has ebbed from 2022, when inflation hit its peak, but has made little improvement recently.


In his press conference following the rate cut last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said his aim was to keep the economy on track between the central bank's two goals of stable inflation and a healthy job market. To that end, credit will ease but at no guaranteed pace.


"This is the beginning of that process," Powell said. "The direction ... is toward a sense of neutral, and we'll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real-time."

## Search underway for suspects in Alabama mass shooting

date: 2024-09-23, from: VOA News USA

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Authorities have reported no immediate arrests after a weekend mass shooting killed four people and left 17 others injured in what police described as a targeted "hit" by multiple shooters who opened fire outside a popular Alabama nightspot.


The shooting late Saturday night in the popular Five Points South entertainment district of Birmingham, rocking an area of restaurants and bars that is often bustling on weekend nights. The mass shooting, one of several this year in the major city, unnerved residents and left officials at home and beyond pleading for help to both solve the crime and address the broader problem of gun violence.


"The priority is to find these shooters and get them off our streets," Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said a day after the shooting.




The mayor planned a morning news conference Monday to provide updates on the case.


The shooting occurred on the sidewalk and street outside Hush, a lounge in the entertainment district, where blood stains were still visible on the sidewalk outside the venue on Sunday morning.


Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmond said authorities believe the shooting targeted one of the people who was killed, possibly in a murder-for-hire. A vehicle pulled up and "multiple shooters" got out and began firing, then fled the scene, he said.


"We believe that there was a 'hit,' if you will, on that particular person," Thurmond said.


Police said approximately 100 shell casings were recovered. Thurmond said law enforcement was working to determine what weapons were used, but they believe some of the gunfire was "fully automatic." Investigators also were trying to determine whether anyone fired back, creating a crossfire.


In a statement late Sunday, police said the shooters are believed to have used "machine gun conversion devices" that make semi-automatic weapons fire more rapidly.


Some surviving victims critically injured 


Officers found two men and a woman on a sidewalk with gunshot wounds and they were pronounced dead there. An additional male gunshot victim was pronounced dead at a hospital, according to police.


Police identified the three victims found on the sidewalk as Anitra Holloman, 21, of the Birmingham suburb of Bessemer, Tahj Booker, 27, of Birmingham, and Carlos McCain, 27, of Birmingham. The fourth victim pronounced dead at the hospital was pending identification.


By the early hours of Sunday, victims began showing up at hospitals and police subsequently identified 17 people with injuries, some of them life-threatening. Four of the surviving victims, in conditions ranging from good to critical, were being treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital on Sunday afternoon, according to Alicia Rohan, a hospital spokeswoman.


A popular nightspot rocked by gunfire 


The area of Birmingham where the gunfire erupted is popular with young adults because of its proximity to the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the plethora of nearby restaurants and bars.


The shooting was the 31st mass killing of 2024, of which 23 were shootings, according to James Alan Fox, a criminologist and professor at Northeastern University, who oversees a mass killings database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with the university.


Three of the nation's 23 mass shootings this year were in Birmingham, including two earlier quadruple homicides.


Mayor pleads for a solution to gun violence


Woodfin expressed frustration at what he described as an epidemic of gun violence in America and the city.


"We find ourselves in 2024, where gun violence is at an epidemic level, an epidemic crisis in our country. And the city of Birmingham, unfortunately, finds itself at the tip of that spear," he said.

## California governor signs law banning all plastic shopping bags at grocery stores

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

Sacramento, California — "Paper or plastic" will no longer be a choice at grocery store checkout lines in California under a new law signed Sunday by Gov. Gavin Newsom that bans all plastic shopping bags.


California had already banned thin plastic shopping bags at supermarkets and other stores, but shoppers could purchase bags made with a thicker plastic that purportedly made them reusable and recyclable.


The new measure, approved by state legislators last month, bans all plastic shopping bags starting in 2026. Consumers who don't bring their own bags will now simply be asked if they want a paper bag.


State Sen. Catherine Blakespear, one of the bill's supporters, said people were not reusing or recycling any plastic bags. She pointed to a state study that found that the amount of plastic shopping bags trashed per person grew from 3.6 kilograms per year in 2004 to 5 kilograms per year in 2021.


Blakespear, a Democrat from Encinitas, said the previous bag ban passed a decade ago didn't reduce the overall use of plastic.


"We are literally choking our planet with plastic waste," she said in February.


The environmental nonprofit Oceana applauded Newsom for signing the bill and "safeguarding California's coastline, marine life, and communities from single-use plastic grocery bags."


Christy Leavitt, Oceana's plastics campaign director, said Sunday that the new ban on single-use plastic bags at grocery store checkouts "solidifies California as a leader in tackling the global plastic pollution crisis."


Twelve states, including California, already have some type of statewide plastic bag ban in place, according to the environmental advocacy group Environment America Research & Policy Center. Hundreds of cities across 28 states also have their own plastic bag bans in place.


The California Legislature passed its statewide ban on plastic bags in 2014. The law was later affirmed by voters in a 2016 referendum.


The California Public Interest Research Group said Sunday that the new law finally meets the intent of the original bag ban.


"Plastic bags create pollution in our environment and break into microplastics that contaminate our drinking water and threaten our health," said the group's director Jenn Engstrom. "Californians voted to ban plastic grocery bags in our state almost a decade ago, but the law clearly needed a redo. With the governor's signature, California has finally banned plastic bags in grocery checkout lanes once and for all."


As San Francisco's mayor in 2007, Newsom signed the nation's first plastic bag ban.

## Spending deal averts possible US federal shutdown, funds government into December

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Congressional leaders announced an agreement Sunday on a short-term spending bill that will fund federal agencies for about three months, averting a possible partial government shutdown when the new budget year begins Oct. 1 and pushing final decisions until after the November election.


Lawmakers have struggled to get to this point as the current budget year winds to a close at month's end. At the urging of the most conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson had linked temporary funding with a mandate that would have compelled states to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.


But Johnson could not get all Republicans on board even as the party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump, insisted on that package. Trump said Republican lawmakers should not support a stop-gap measure without the voting requirement, but the bill went down to defeat anyway, with 14 Republicans opposing it.


Bipartisan negotiations began in earnest shortly after that, with leadership agreeing to extend funding into mid-December. That gives the current Congress the ability to fashion a full-year spending bill after the Nov. 5 election, rather than push that responsibility to the next Congress and president.


In a letter to Republican colleagues, Johnson said the budget measure would be “very narrow, bare-bones" and include "only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.”


“While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances," Johnson wrote. "As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice.”


Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, had said on Friday that talks were going well.


“So far, nothing has come up that we can't deal with," said Cole, R-Okla. “Most people don't want a government shutdown and they don't want that to interfere with the election. So nobody is like, ‘I’ve got to have this or we're walking.' It's just not that way.”


Johnson's earlier effort had no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate and was opposed by the White House, but it did give the speaker a chance to show Trump and conservatives within his conference that he fought for their request.


The final result — government funding effectively on autopilot — was what many had predicted. With the election just weeks away, few lawmakers in either party had any appetite for the brinksmanship that often leads to a shutdown.


Now a bipartisan majority is expected to push the short-term measure over the finish line. Temporary spending bills generally fund agencies at current levels, but some additional money was included to bolster the Secret Service, replenish a disaster relief fund and aid with the presidential transition, among other things.

## Ukraine's Zelenskyy visits Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank workers

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

Scranton, Pennsylvania — Under extraordinarily tight security, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday visited the Pennsylvania ammunition factory that is producing one of the most critically needed munitions for his country's fight to fend off Russian ground forces.


His visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant kicked off a busy week in the United States to shore up support for Ukraine in the war. He will speak at the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday and then travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.


As Zelenskyy's large motorcade made its way to the ammunition plant on Sunday afternoon, a small contingent of supporters waving Ukrainian flags assembled nearby to show their appreciation for his visit to thank the workers.


The area around the ammunition plant had been sealed off since the morning, with municipal garbage trucks positioned across several roadblocks and a very heavy presence of city, regional and state police, including troopers on horseback.


The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells and has increased production over the past year.


The 155 mm shells are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 24 kilometers to 32 kilometers away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance.


Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells from the U.S.




"It's unfortunate that we need a plant like this, but it's here, and it's here to protect the world," said Vera Kowal Krewsun, a first-generation Ukrainian American who was among those who greeted Zelenskyy's motorcade. "And I strongly feel that way."


She said many of her friends' parents have worked in the ammunition plant, and she called Zelenskyy's visit "a wonderful thing."


Laryssa Salak, 60, whose parents also immigrated from Ukraine, also said she was pleased Zelenskyy came to thank the workers. She said it upsets her that funding for Ukraine's defense has divided Americans and that even some of her friends oppose the support, saying the money should go to help Americans instead.


"But they don't understand that that money does not directly go to Ukraine, Salak said. "It goes to American factories that manufacture, like here, like the ammunition. So that money goes to American workers as well. And a lot of people don't understand that."


With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia.


So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions.




The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital.


Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be "at war" with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons.


At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan.


In response the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month.


Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer — were expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.


The 155 mm rounds are just one of the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense.


Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many of the European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict.

## Republicans in swing states say they see scant signs of groups door-knocking for Trump

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

Lansing, Michigan — Republican activists in swing states say they have seen little sign of the teams tasked with knocking on doors and turning out infrequent voters on behalf of Donald Trump, raising concerns about the party's presidential nominee relying on outside groups for an important part of his campaign operations.


Trump and the Republican National Committee he controls opted to share get-out-the-vote duties in key parts of the most competitive states this year with groups such as America PAC, the organization supported by billionaire Elon Musk.


It is difficult to demonstrate that something is not happening. But with fewer than 50 days until the Nov. 5 election, dozens of Republican officials, activists and operatives in Michigan, North Carolina and other battleground states say they have rarely or never witnessed the group's canvassers. In Arizona and Nevada, the Musk-backed political action committee replaced its door-knocking company just this past week.


"I haven't seen anybody," said Nate Wilkowski, field director for the Republican Party in vote-rich Oakland County, Michigan, which includes crucial Detroit suburbs. He was speaking specifically of America PAC. "Nobody's given me a heads-up that they're around in Oakland County areas."


Trump has relied on the loyalty of his fervent base, in an election expected to pivot on turnout. The spotty evidence, however, of what was portrayed as a sophisticated operation has some party activists questioning the operation's value. Trump's campaign views the race with Vice President Kamala Harris as a toss-up among likely voters but believes it has the edge among people who stayed away in 2016 and 2020, making it even more essential to reach them.


The work is particularly important in Michigan, where Trump lost by fewer than 160,000 votes in 2020, and where the Republican Party began the year mired in debt and fighting an ugly contest over the rightful state party leader.


Michigan's Republican chairman, Pete Hoekstra, said he was told that America PAC canvassers had arrived in late August and were at work. A spokesperson for the PAC said canvassers were in Michigan, as well as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the seven most competitive states. The spokesperson declined to say how many canvassers there were across the states.


Meghan Reckling, a Republican canvassing firm owner in Michigan, said she spotted two America PAC canvassers Tuesday in Oakland County. Identifiable in blue polo shirts emblazoned with "America," they were working an area that Reckling's own data showed to be one with low-propensity voters, she said.


"They had, you could tell, a very pleasant exchange with the lady who answered the door, and probably talked to her for five minutes," Reckling said. "From what I observed, they were obviously engaging in direct conversations."


But in interviews with more than two dozen activists and party officials across the seven battleground states, such reports were rare.


"I don't know what the PACs are doing," said Mark Forton, the Republican chair in Macomb County, Michigan, a populous, suburban area northeast of Detroit. "I don't know if they are going door to door."


Trump aides say the campaign has an estimated 30,000 volunteer captains who are identifying less likely voters at the local level, including through neighborhood canvassing.


Campaign political director James Blair also estimates that close to 2,500 paid canvassers, with America PAC making up a significant chunk, are working in the seven states. The PAC has paid canvassing firms more than $14 million since mid-August for work on the presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission spending reports filed by the group.


Blair dismissed the statement that the campaign was ceding work to outside groups. Instead, he said, the campaign was making use of "the resources within those groups to bolster the frequency of contacts and the total coverage within the universe of where we would want them."


"We very much are focused on low-propensity voters, because it's what makes strategically the most sense in terms of how the president is going to win these states, and these groups' efforts have helped reach them," Blair said.


America PAC is run by former top aides to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' failed presidential campaign. Trump's team also is sharing the responsibility of reaching less-frequent voters with groups that include Turning Point USA, led by conservative millennial personality Charlie Kirk, and the Faith and Freedom Coalition, headed by Christian conservative figure Ralph Reed.


Part of the reason for the campaign's move was the result of an FEC ruling this year that a candidate's campaign and outside groups could coordinate their canvassing efforts with super PACs, and specifically share voter lists and data that they collect door to door. It means campaigns could share much of their labor- and cost-heavy ground efforts with groups that can take unlimited donations.


Harris' outreach on the ground in the seven states is being led by campaign-paid staff, a number the campaign puts at nearly 2,200 in more than 328 offices. Campaign aides said groups affiliated with labor organizations were canvassing independent of the campaign.


The vast majority of what outside groups that support Harris are doing is advertising. Based on ad reservations for Harris and the leading super PAC supporting her, they are on track to spend nearly $175 million more than Trump's campaign and the leading super PACs supporting him by Election Day. Harris' campaign has outspent Trump's on advertising by 2-to-1 since she entered the race on July 23, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact.


Over the past week, there were complications for America PAC, the most high-profile of the groups helping Trump in 2024.


America PAC fired Nevada-based canvassing company September Group, according to two people familiar with the matter. America PAC had paid the company almost $2.7 million a month ago, according to FEC reports. The people familiar with September Group's dismissal spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private business decisions.


A spokesman for America PAC declined to confirm the move.


Trump is not the first candidate to delegate some typical campaign-managed duties to outside groups. But the arrangement has not gone smoothly for some of the others who have tried it.


Last year, DeSantis entrusted much of the political outreach for his Republican presidential campaign to a super PAC called Never Back Down, with conflict between its board and top campaign personnel late in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. Despite starting the campaign with roughly $100 million, DeSantis dropped out after losing the first contest in Iowa.


In his unsuccessful quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush attempted something very similar, ceding much of the political infrastructure work to a super PAC called Right to Rise, which raised more than $114 million in 2015.

## On New York visit, India's Modi celebrates cultural ties

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

Uniondale, New York — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, continuing a multiday U.S. visit, addressed a cultural celebration on Long Island Sunday, where he praised the United States' return of nearly 300 antiquities to India and relayed news of his country's dual win at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary, to an enthusiastic crowd.


"I just got some very good news," Modi told an estimated 13,000 people inside Nassau Veterans Coliseum for an event billed as a celebration of cultural ties between India and the United States. "In the Chess Olympiad, in both the men's and women's tournament, India has won gold medals," he said to applause in a speech that was translated into English for an online audience.


Modi was reelected in June following a marathon election in which more than 640 million votes were cast over a span of six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise.


"This year, 2024, is a very important one for the entire world," he said. "On the one hand, there are conflicts raging between several countries in the world, there is tension. And on the other, democracy is being celebrated in several countries of the world. India and America are also together in this celebration of democracy."


Modi's appearance in New York came a day after he attended a summit hosted by President Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware, for leaders of the so-called Quad that also included Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan.


Also Saturday, Modi accepted the return of 297 antiquities spanning thousands of years that had been stolen or trafficked from India. The U.S. has returned nearly 600 such cultural artifacts to India since 2016, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs.


On Monday, the prime minister is expected to attend a United Nations summit in advance of this week's General Assembly.


Sunday's event was sponsored by the not-for-profit Indo American Community of USA.

## US to propose ban on Chinese software, hardware in connected vehicles, sources say

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Commerce Department is expected on Monday to propose prohibiting Chinese software and hardware in connected and autonomous vehicles on American roads due to national security concerns, two sources told Reuters.


The Biden administration has raised serious concerns about the collection of data by Chinese companies on U.S. drivers and infrastructure as well as the potential foreign manipulation of vehicles connected to the internet and navigation systems.


The proposed regulation would ban the import and sale of vehicles from China with key communications or automated driving system software or hardware, said the two sources, who declined to be identified because the decision had not been publicly disclosed.


The move is a significant escalation in the United States' ongoing restrictions on Chinese vehicles, software and components. Last week, the Biden administration locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles as well as new hikes on EV batteries and key minerals.


Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in May the risks of Chinese software or hardware in connected U.S. vehicles were significant.


"You can imagine the most catastrophic outcome theoretically if you had a couple million cars on the road and the software were disabled," she said.


President Joe Biden in February ordered an investigation into whether Chinese vehicle imports pose national security risks over connected-car technology -- and if that software and hardware should be banned in all vehicles on U.S. roads.


"China's policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security," Biden said earlier. "I’m not going to let that happen on my watch."


The Commerce Department plans to give the public 30 days to comment before any finalization of the rules, the sources said. Nearly all newer vehicles on U.S. roads are considered "connected." Such vehicles have onboard network hardware that allows internet access, allowing them to share data with devices both inside and outside the vehicle.


The department also plans to propose making the prohibitions on software effective in the 2027 model year and the ban on hardware would take effect in January 2029 or the 2030 model year. The prohibitions in question would include vehicles with certain Bluetooth, satellite and wireless features as well as highly autonomous vehicles that could operate without a driver behind the wheel.


A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers in November raised alarm about Chinese auto and tech companies collecting and handling sensitive data while testing autonomous vehicles in the United States.


The prohibitions would extend to other foreign U.S. adversaries, including Russia, the sources said.


A trade group representing major automakers including General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and others had warned that changing hardware and software would take time.


The carmakers noted their systems "undergo extensive pre-production engineering, testing, and validation processes and, in general, cannot be easily swapped with systems or components from a different supplier."


The Commerce Department declined to comment on Saturday. Reuters first reported, in early August, details of a plan that would have the effect of barring the testing of autonomous vehicles by Chinese automakers on U.S. roads. There are relatively few Chinese-made light-duty vehicles imported into the United States.


The White House on Thursday signed off on the final proposal, according to a government website. The rule is aimed at ensuring the security of the supply chain for U.S. connected vehicles. It will apply to all vehicles on U.S. roads, but not for agriculture or mining vehicles, the sources said.


Biden noted that most cars are connected like smartphones on wheels, linked to phones, navigation systems, critical infrastructure and to the companies that made them.

## 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice' scares off 'Transformers' for third week as box office No. 1

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

Los Angeles — It's a three-peat for "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice."


The Tim Burton legacy sequel to his 1988 horror comedy topped the North American box office charts for the third straight weekend with $26 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.


It edged out the animated new release "Transformers: One," which brought in $25 million. The Optimus Prime origin story from Paramount Pictures features the voices of Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry and Scarlett Johansson.


"Beetlejuice Beetlejuice," a Warner Bros. release with Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder returning as stars, has earned more than $226 million domestically in its three weeks after a monster opening of $110 million — the third best of the year — and a second weekend of $51.6 million.


Third place went to the James McAvoy horror "Speak No Evil," which came in at $5.9 million in its second week for a total of $21.5 million.


On the whole, the box office was in a quiet phase that is expected to break when " Joker: Folie à Deux " dances its way onto the big screen on Oct. 4.


The year's second-highest grosser " Deadpool & Wolverine " remained in the top 5 in its ninth weekend with another $3.9 million and a domestic total of $627 million. Only Pixar's "Inside Out 2" has earned more.


The Demi Moore-starring, Coralie Fargeat-directed body horror "The Substance," which made a splash at the Cannes Film Festival, brought in $3.1 million on limited screens in its first weekend for the sixth spot.


The Daily Wire movie "Am I Racist?" — in which conservative columnist Matt Walsh goes undercover as a "DEI trainee" — stayed in the top 10 after a fourth place finish last week, earning $2.9 million for seventh place and a two-week total of $9 million.


Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.


1. "Beetlejuice Beetlejuice," $26 million.


2. "Transformers One," $25 million.


3. "Speak No Evil," $5.9 million.


4. "Never Let Go," $4.5 million.


5. "Deadpool & Wolverine," $3.9 million.


6. "The Substance," $3.1 million.


7. "Am I Racist?" $2.5 million.


8. "Reagan," $1.7 million.


9. "JUNG KOOK: I AM STILL," $1.4 million.


10. "Alien Romulus," $1.3 million.

## Some US lawmakers urge cooling of heated presidential campaign rhetoric

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

U.S. lawmakers from both major political parties have called for cooling the nation’s heated political rhetoric six weeks before the November 5th presidential election.

## Investor focus turns to data, election, earnings after Fed rate cut

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — A roaring rally in U.S. stocks will face a gauntlet of economic data, looming political uncertainty and a corporate earnings test in coming weeks as investors navigate one of the most volatile periods of the year for equity markets.  


The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX last week hit its first closing all-time high in two months after the Federal Reserve unveiled a hefty 50-basis point rate cut, kicking off the first U.S. monetary easing cycle since 2020.  


The index is up 0.8% so far in September, historically the weakest month for stocks, and has gained 19% year-to-date. But the rocky period could carry over until the Nov 5 election, strategists said, leaving the S&P 500 vulnerable to market swings.  




"We're entering that period where seasonality has been a bit less favorable,” said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. "Despite the excitement about the start of the new rate-cutting cycle, it could still be a bumpy road ahead."  


The second half of September is historically the weakest two-week period of the year for the S&P 500, according to a Ned Davis Research analysis of data since 1950.  


The index has also logged an average 0.45% decline in October during presidential years, data from CFRA going back to 1945 showed.  


Volatility also tends to pick up in October in election years, with the Cboe Market Volatility index .VIX rising to an average level of 25 at the start of the month, as opposed to its long-term average of 19.2, according to an Edward Jones analysis of the past eight presidential election years. The VIX was recently at 16.4.  


The market could be particularly sensitive to this year's close election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Recent polls show a virtually tied race.  


"Unless the data deteriorates considerably, we think U.S . elections will start to be more at the forefront," UBS equity derivative strategists said in a note.    


Investors are also looking for data to support expectations that the economy is navigating a "soft landing," during which inflation moderates without badly hurting growth. Stocks fare much better after the start of rate cuts in such a scenario, as opposed to when the Fed cuts during recessions.  


The coming week includes reports on manufacturing, consumer confidence and durable goods, as well as the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure.  


Attention will be squarely on employment after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank wanted to stay ahead of any weakening in the job market as the Fed announced its cut last week. The closely-watched monthly U.S. jobs report is due on Oct 4.  




"We're going to have hyper-focus on anything that speaks to the strength of the labor force," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. 


Meanwhile, the rally in stocks has pushed up valuations. The S&P 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.4 times expected 12-month earnings, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream.  


With the scope for valuations to go higher now more limited, investors said that puts a greater burden on corporate earnings to be strong in order to support stock gains.  


Third-quarter reporting season kicks off next month. S&P 500 earnings for the period are expected to have climbed 5.4% from the prior year, and then jump nearly 13% in the fourth quarter, according to LSEG IBES.  


FedEx FDX.N shares tumbled on Friday after the delivery giant reported a steep quarterly profit drop and lowered its full-year revenue forecast.  


"Extended multiples put pressure on macro data and fundamentals to support S&P 500 prices," Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity strategy at Citi, said in a report.

## ‘Quad’ leaders move to create ‘free and secure’ Indo-Pacific at summit

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

President Joe Biden on Saturday hosted the leaders of Australia, India and Japan for his final convening of the so-called Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific. The quartet announced moves they say will boost cooperation between the four democracies and address citizens’ concerns in the massive region – while also emphasizing this is not a club aimed at containing China. VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell reports from Washington.

## More shelter beds and a crackdown on tents mean fewer homeless encampments in San Francisco

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

SAN FRANCISCO — Sidewalks once teeming with tents, tarps and people passed out next to heaps of trash have largely disappeared from great swaths of San Francisco, a city widely known for its visible homeless population.


The number of people sleeping outdoors dropped to under 3,000 in January, the lowest the city has recorded in a decade, according to a federal count.


And that figure has likely dropped even lower since Mayor London Breed — a Democrat in a difficult reelection fight this November — started ramping up enforcement of anti-camping laws in August following a U.S. Supreme Court decision.


Homelessness in no way has gone away, and in fact grew 7%, to 8,300 in January, according to the same federal count.


But the problem is now notably out of the public eye, raising the question of where people have gone and whether the change marks a turning point in a crisis long associated with San Francisco.


“We’re seeing much cleaner sidewalks,” said Terry Asten Bennett, owner of Cliff’s Variety store in the city’s historically gay Castro neighborhood, adding that she hates to see homeless people shuffled around.


“But also, as a business owner, I need clean, inviting streets to encourage people to come and shop and visit our city," she said.




Advocates for homeless people say encampment sweeps that force people off the streets are an easy way to hide homelessness from public view.


“Shelter should always be transitional,” said Lukas Illa, an organizer with San Francisco's Coalition on Homelessness. “We shouldn’t have folks be in there as the long-lasting solution.”


Other California cities have also reported a drop in visible homelessness, thanks to improved outreach and more temporary housing. The beach city of Santa Cruz reported a 49% decline in people sleeping unsheltered this year, while Los Angeles recorded a 10% drop.


San Francisco has increased the number of shelter beds and permanent supportive housing units by more than 50% over the past six years. At the same time, city officials are on track to eclipse the nearly 500 sweeps conducted last year, with Breed prioritizing bus tickets out of the city for homeless people and authorizing police to do more to stamp out tents.


San Francisco police have issued at least 150 citations for illegal lodging since Aug. 1, surpassing the 60 citations over the entire previous three years. City crews also have removed more than 1,200 tents and structures.


Tracking homeless people is extremely difficult and where all the people once living on San Francisco’s streets have gone is impossible to know.


There are still people sleeping on sidewalks, some with just a blanket, and tents continue to crop up under freeway overpasses and more isolated corners of the city. But tents that once sprouted outside libraries and subway stations, and went on endlessly for blocks in the Mission, downtown and South of Market districts, are gone. Even the troubled Tenderloin district has seen progress.


Steven Burcell, who became homeless a year ago after a shoulder injury cost him his job, moved into one of 60 new, tiny cabins in May after the car he was living in caught fire.


Mission Cabins is a new type of emergency shelter that offers privacy and allows pets. But like all shelters, it has rules. No drugs, weapons or outside guests are allowed. Residents must consent to their rooms being searched.


“At the beginning, it was rough, you know, going in and just getting adjusted to being searched and having them look through your bags,” acknowledged Burcell, 51.


His tidy 65-square-foot (6-square-meter) room contains a twin bed, pairs of shoes lined by a door that locks and opens onto a sunny courtyard that, on a recent morning, was filled with the voices of children playing at the elementary school next door.


“To have your own space inside here and close the door, not sharing anything with anybody," he said, “it’s huge.”


But Burcell opposes encampment sweeps. He said two friends rejected beds because they thought — inaccurately, he said — the shelter would be infested with rodents. That did not stop crews from taking their tent and everything inside it.


“Now they have nothing. They don’t have any shelter at all,” he said. “They just kind of wander around and take buses, like a lot of people do.”


Since 2018, San Francisco has added 1,800 emergency shelter beds and nearly 5,000 permanent supportive housing units, where people pay 30% of their income toward rent and the rest is subsidized, bringing the total to more than 4,200 beds and 14,000 units.


Breed, who first won office in June 2018, can claim credit for the expansion, although some plans were in place before she became mayor and her administration had huge financial help.


The money came from the federal government battling the pandemic and a California governor — and onetime San Francisco mayor — who made fighting homelessness and tent encampments his priority. Gov. Gavin Newsom has pumped at least $24 billion into the effort since taking office in 2019, including a program to turn hotels into housing.


San Francisco also benefited from a controversial 2018 wealth tax on the city’s tech titans that Breed opposed, saying companies would leave. There was no exodus and the pandemic overshadowed any fallout.


The funds have helped get people off the streets and tripled the annual budget of the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing from nearly $300 million in 2018 to $850 million this year.


But the department's budget is expected to dip below $700 million next year, and that worries experts who say more is needed in a city where the median price of a home is $1.4 million.


“We still have a housing market that is way too expensive for way too many people. And as long as that continues to be the case, we’re going to see folks falling into homelessness,” said Alex Visotzky, a policy fellow with the National Alliance to End Homelessness.


Advocates for the homeless say that's why city officials need to invest in more affordable housing.


One such place is 835 Turk Street, a former hotel the city purchased and reopened two years ago as supportive housing. It's home to David Labogin, who lost his housing after his mother died.


“Of course, things could be a whole lot better,” he said, sitting on a single bed, “but from where I came from, I got no complaints.”


But housing takes longer to build, and converting old properties is not cheap. The city purchased 835 Turk for $25 million and spent $18 million — twice the estimated amount — rehabilitating it.


Until then, shelters are adapting, accommodating couples and people with pets.




It takes new residents about two weeks to adjust to the rules at Mission Cabins, said Steve Good, CEO of operator Five Keys. “A few rules to keep them safe is better than living on the street, where there aren’t any rules,” he said.


“Amen,” said Patrick Richardson, 54, who stopped by to watch as Good was interviewed. He was on his way to a two-year college in Oakland where he is studying to be an X-ray technician.


Richardson had been sleeping on couches and pavement when an outreach worker offered him a cabin.


His new home, he said, “rescued me.

## Newsboat 2.37 is out, along with bugfix releases for 2.19 through 2.36

date: 2024-09-22, updated: 2024-09-22, from: Newsboat News


            <p>
                Since 2.19, Newsboat treated HTTP code 304 (Not Modified) as
                error, and retried the download up to the limit specified by
                `download-retries`. The default for that setting is 1, so no
                harm done, but if the user changed it, Newsboat turned into a
                request-spamming machine.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today’s release fixes that. We’re also making point releases for
                everything starting from 2.19 all the way up to the previous
                release, 2.36. If you can upgrade to 2.37, great. If you can't,
                please, <i>please</i> upgrade to the closest point release you can.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a bunch of other fixes and improvements in 2.37 as
                well, but they’re less important, so find them in the changelog.

## Mass shooting kills 4, wounds 17 in nightlife district in Birmingham, Alabama

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

BIRMINGHAM, Alabama  — Four people were killed and 17 others injured when multiple shooters opened fire Saturday in what police described as a targeted "hit" on one of the people killed at a popular nightlife spot in Birmingham, Alabama.


The shooting happened shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday in Five Points South, a district filled with entertainment venues, restaurants and bars that is often crowded on weekend nights. The mass shooting, one of several this year in the city, unnerved residents in the area and left city officials pleading for help to both solve the crime and address the broader problem of gun violence.


"The priority is to find these shooters and get them off our streets," Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said at a Sunday press conference.


The shooting occurred outside Hush, a hookah and cigar lounge, in the entertainment district. Blood stains were visible on the sidewalk outside the venue on Sunday morning.


Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmond said authorities believe the shooting targeted one of the people who was killed, possibly in a murder-for-hire. He said a vehicle pulled up and "multiple shooters" got out and began firing, then fled the scene.


"We believe that there was a 'hit,' if you will, on that particular person," Thurmond said.


Police said approximately 100 shell casings were recovered at the scene. Thurmond said law enforcement was working to determine what weapons were used, but they believe some of the gunfire was "fully automatic."  


Investigators were also trying to determine whether anyone fired back, creating crossfire.


Police said officers found two men and a woman on a sidewalk with gunshot wounds and they were pronounced dead there. An additional male gunshot victim was pronounced dead at a hospital, according to police.


By early Sunday, after victims began showing up at hospitals, police had identified 17 people with injuries, some of them life-threatening. Four of the surviving victims, in conditions ranging from good to critical, were being treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital on Sunday afternoon, according to Alicia Rohan, a UAB spokeswoman.


The area of Birmingham is popular with young adults because of its proximity to the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the plethora of nearby restaurants and bars.


Geoffrey Boshell, a 22-year-old biomedical engineering student who lives nearby, said he was working on a school project when he heard a burst of rapid pops that he said sounded like automatic gunfire.


"I heard it, looked out my window and immediately see people screaming, fleeing the scene," Boshell said.


The shooting in the bustling and popular area was unnerving, he said. "I'm not sure scared is the right word. Just very disturbed that it was happening right outside where you are living."


Ashton Mills, 24, who lives in a nearby apartment complex, was headed to work Saturday night when she heard a "bunch of popping sounds."


"It's scary, especially as a single woman walking around the city," she said. "I'm definitely a lot more on guard."


Woodfin expressed frustration at what he described as an epidemic of gun violence in America.


"We find ourselves in 2024, where gun violence is at an epidemic level, an epidemic crisis in our country. And the city of Birmingham, unfortunately finds itself at the tip of that spear," he said.


The Birmingham mayor also urged state and federal officials to give cities more tools to address gun violence. He put both hands behind his back to illustrate what it is like for cities to combat crime. Alabama last year abolished the requirement to get a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public.


Woodfun said there is an "element" in the city that is too comfortable carrying Glock switches — which convert semi-automatic handguns to deliver more rapid fire — and assault-style rifles with the intent of doing harm.


"Elected officials locally, statewide and nationally have a duty to solve this American crisis, this American epidemic of gun violence," the mayor said.

## This US city is hailed as a vaccination success. Can it be sustained?

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

LOUISVILLE, Kentucky  — On his first day of school at Newcomer Academy, Maikel Tejeda was whisked to the school library. The 7th grader didn't know why.


He soon got the point: He was being given make-up vaccinations. Five of them.


"I don't have a problem with that," said the 12-year-old, who moved from Cuba early this year.


Across the library, a group of city, state and federal officials gathered to celebrate the school clinic, and the city. With U.S. childhood vaccination rates below their goals, Louisville and the state were being praised as success stories: Kentucky's vaccination rate for kindergarteners rose 2 percentage points in the 2022-23 school year compared with the year before. The rate for Jefferson County — which is Louisville — was up 4 percentage points.


"Progress is success," said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


But that progress didn't last. Kentucky's school entry vaccination rate slipped last year. Jefferson County's rate slid, too. And the rates for both the county and state remain well below the target thresholds.


It raises the question: If this is what success looks like, what does it say about the nation's ability to stop imported infections from turning into community outbreaks?


Local officials believe they can get to herd immunity thresholds, but they acknowledge challenges that includes tight funding, misinformation and well-intended bureaucratic rules that can discourage doctors from giving kids shots.


"We're closing the gap," said Eva Stone, who has managed the county school system's health services since 2018. "We're not closing the gap very quickly."


Falling vaccination rates


Public health experts focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and the launching pad for community outbreaks.


For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to mandates that required key vaccinations as a condition of school attendance.




But they have slid in recent years. When COVID-19 started hitting the U.S. hard in 2020, schools were closed, visits to pediatricians declined and vaccination record-keeping fell off. Meanwhile, more parents questioned routine childhood vaccinations that they used to automatically accept, an effect that experts attribute to misinformation and the political schism that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines.


A Gallup survey released last month found that 40% of Americans said it is extremely important for parents to have their children vaccinated, down from 58% in 2019. Meanwhile, a recent University of Pennsylvania survey of 1,500 people found that about 1 in 4 U.S. adults think the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism — despite no medical evidence for it.


All that has led more parents to seek exemptions to school entry vaccinations. The CDC has not yet reported national data for the 2023-24 school year, but the proportion of U.S. kindergartners exempted from school vaccination requirements the year before hit a record 3%.


Overall, 93% of kindergartners got their required shots for the 2022-23 school year. The rate was 95% in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic.


Officials worry slipping vaccination rates will lead to disease outbreaks.


The roughly 250 U.S. measles cases reported so far this year are the most since 2019, and Oregon is seeing its largest outbreak in more than 30 years.


Kentucky has been experiencing its worst outbreak of whooping cough — another vaccine-preventable disease — since 2017. Nationally, nearly 14,000 cases have been reported this year, the most since 2019.


Persuading parents


The whooping cough surge is a warning sign but also an opportunity, said Kim Tolley, a California-based historian who wrote a book last year on the vaccination of American schoolchildren. She called for a public relations campaign to "get everybody behind" improving immunizations.


Much of the discussion about raising vaccination rates centers on campaigns designed to educate parents about the importance of vaccinating children — especially those on the fence about getting shots for their kids.


But experts are still hashing out what kind of messaging work best: Is it better, for example, to say "vaccinate" or "immunize''?


A lot of the messaging is influenced by feedback from small focus groups. One takeaway is some people have less trust in health officials and even their own doctors than they once did. Another is that they strongly trust their own feelings about vaccines and what they've seen in Internet searches or heard from other sources.


"Their overconfidence is hard to shake. It's hard to poke holes in it," said Mike Perry, who ran focus groups on behalf of a group called the Public Health Communications Collaborative.


But many people seem more trusting of older vaccines. And they do seem to be at least curious about information they didn't know, including the history of research behind vaccines and the dangers of the diseases they were created to fight, he said.


Improving access


Dolores Albarracin has studied vaccination improvement strategies in 17 countries, and repeatedly found that the most effective strategy is to make it easier for kids to get vaccinated.


"In practice, most people are not vaccinating simply because they don't have money to take the bus" or have other troubles getting to appointments, said Albarracin, director of the communication science division within Penn's Annenberg Public Policy Center.


That's a problem in Louisville, where officials say few doctors were providing vaccinations to children enrolled in Medicaid and fewer still were providing shots to kids without any health insurance. An analysis a few years ago indicated 1 in 5 children — about 20,000 kids — were not current on their vaccinations, and most of them were poor, said Stone, the county school health manager.


A 30-year-old federal program called Vaccines for Children pays for vaccinations for children who Medicaid-eligible or lack the insurance to cover it.


But in a meeting with the CDC director last month, Louisville health officials lamented that most local doctors don't participate in the program because of paperwork and other administrative headaches. And it can be tough for patients to get the time and transportation to get to those few dozen Louisville providers who do take part.


The school system has tried to fill the gap. In 2019, it applied to become a VFC provider, and gradually established vaccine clinics.


Last year, it held clinics at nearly all 160 schools, and it's doing the same thing this year. The first was at Newcomer Academy, where many immigrant students behind on their vaccinations are started in the school system.


It's been challenging, Stone said. Funding is very limited. There are bureaucratic obstacles, and a growing influx of children from other countries who need shots. It takes multiple trips to a doctor or clinic to complete some vaccine series. And then there's the opposition — vaccination clinic announcements tend to draw hateful social media comments.

## Refugees in New Hampshire turn to farming for income and a taste of home

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

DUNBARTON, New Hampshire — It's harvest time in central New Hampshire, and one farm there appears to have been transplanted from a distant continent.


Farmers balance large crates laden with vegetables on their heads while chatting in Somali and other languages. As the sun burns away the early morning mist, the farmers pick American staples like corn and tomatoes as well as crops they grew up with, like okra and sorrel. Many of the women wear vibrant orange, red and blue fabrics.


Most workers at this Dunbarton farm are refugees who have escaped harrowing wars and persecution. They come from the African nations of Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia and Congo, and they now run their own small businesses, selling their crops to local markets as well as to friends and connections in their ethnic communities. Farming provides them with both an income and a taste of home.


"I like it in the USA. I have my own job," says Somali refugee and farmer Khadija Aliow as she hams it up by sashaying past a reporter, using one hand to steady the crate of crops on her head and the other to give a thumbs-up. "Happy. I'm so happy."


The farm is owned by a New Hampshire-based nonprofit, the Organization for Refugee and Immigrant Success, which lets the farmers use plots of land and provides them with training and support. The organization runs similar farms in Concord and the nearby town of Boscawen.


In all, 36 people from five African countries, including South Sudan, and the Asian nation of Nepal work on the farms. Many were farmers in their home countries before coming to the U.S. or had previous experience with agriculture, said Tom McGee, a program director with the nonprofit.




"These are farmers who are basically independent business owners, who are working in partnership with our organization to be able to bring this produce to life in this country," he said. "And to have another sense of purpose, and a way that they can bring themselves into the community and belong. And really participate in the American dream."


The nonprofit runs a food market in Manchester, where people can buy fresh produce or sign up to have boxes delivered. McGee said there are a few other programs with similar aims scattered throughout the U.S. but that the model remains relatively rare. He said his organization relies on state and federal funding, as well as private donations.


Farmer Sylvain Bukasa said he escaped in 2000 from the decades-long conflict in Congo that has resulted in millions of deaths. He spent six years with his wife and son in a refugee camp in Tanzania before being accepted into the U.S. in 2006.


"I was worried for my safety," he said. "I decided to just go somewhere where it's a little bit safer."


Bukasa said he has worked hard since arriving in the U.S. and relishes his new life. But at first he missed the foods he grew up with. He could only find them in specialized markets, where they tended to be expensive and of poor quality.


"Back home we ate more vegetables and less meat," he said. "When we came here, it's more chicken, more pizza, things like that. They taste good, but it's not good for you."


Bukasa started growing crops on the farm in 2011. The initial plan on the Dunbarton farm was to allow migrants like him to grow traditional crops for themselves and their families. But demand grew, particularly during the pandemic, prompting the farm's evolution into a commercial operation.


For a few of the farmers, the harvest provides their primary income. For most, like Bukasa, it's a side gig. He works fulltime as a service agent for a rental car company and travels whenever he can to tend his plot of just over 0.4 hectares. The biggest challenges are making sure his crops are adequately watered and stopping the weeds from taking over, he said.


Mondays are harvest days, and on a recent Monday, Bukasa listed the crops he was picking: tomatoes, summer squash, zucchini, kale, corn, okra, and the leaves from pumpkins and sorrel — which he and the other migrants call sour-sour because of its taste.




He said there's a surprisingly large Congolese community throughout New England, and they appreciate what he grows.


"It's a hard job, but hard work is good work," Bukasa said. "It's fun and it helps people. I like when I satisfy people with the food that they eat."


His dream is to one day buy his own farm with a couple of acres of land, so he can walk out his front door to tend to his crops rather than driving 20 minutes like he does now. A more immediate challenge, he said, is to work on the marketing side of his business.


He's got to the point where he now grows more food than he's able to sell, and he hates seeing any of it go to waste. One idea is to buy a van, so he can deliver more produce himself.


"You see the competition in there," he says with a grin, motioning toward the tent where other refugee farmers wash and pack their crops. "See how many farmers are trying to sell their produce."

## ‘Quad’ leaders move to create ‘free and secure’ Indo-Pacific at summit

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

WILMINGTON, DELAWARE/WASHINGTON  — U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday hosted the leaders of Australia, India and Japan at his private home in the U.S. state of Delaware for his final convening of the Quad, a strategic security grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific.


But it was Biden’s comments, unintentionally heard by the press, that illuminated the main topic at this unusually private meeting -- and that topic was China.


Biden said his administration reads Beijing’s recent actions, including flexing its territorial muscles, as a "change in tactic, not a change in strategy."


"We believe [Chinese President] Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China’s diplomatic relationships, and he's also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China's interests," Biden told the other three leaders in what he said were prepared remarks.


"China continues to behave aggressively, testing this all across the region, and it's true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South China, South Asia and the Taiwan Straits. It’s true across the scope of our relationship, including in economic and technology issues," he added.


Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, including territory claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. It also claims territories in the East China Sea contested by Japan and Taiwan. It views democratically governed Taiwan as part of China.




Publicly, Biden’s message was shorter, simpler – "The Quad is here to stay."


Those six words were also the final sentence of a lengthy joint statement from Biden and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. The group issued their nearly 5,700-word missive after a day of meetings so cloistered that the president of the White House Correspondents’ Association called the lack of access "unacceptable."


In their statement, the quartet announced moves they say will boost cooperation among the four democracies and address concerns beyond their borders in the massive region, home to more than half of the world’s population and two-thirds of its economy. While they used the word "China" sparingly – only three times, and all three times in reference to the South China Sea – they made very clear how their stance differs from Beijing’s.


"As four leading maritime democracies in the Indo-Pacific, we unequivocally stand for the maintenance of peace and stability across this dynamic region, as an indispensable element of global security and prosperity," they said.


"We strongly oppose any destabilizing or unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion. We condemn recent illicit missile launches in the region that violate U.N. Security Council resolutions. We express serious concern over recent dangerous and aggressive actions in the maritime domain. We seek a region where no country dominates and no country is dominated — one where all countries are free from coercion and can exercise their agency to determine their futures."


China has previously called out the Quad for its thinly veiled criticisms of China, with a Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson in July comparing the grouping to "exclusive clubs that undermine trust and cooperation among regional countries."


Biden spoke briefly to tout the major steps, including one that aims to strengthen maritime security, and that will inevitably affect China’s maritime presence in others’ waters.


"We're announcing a series of initiatives to deliver real, positive impact for the Indo-Pacific that includes providing new maritime technologies to our regional partners, so they know what's happening in their waters, launching cooperation between coast guards for the first time, and expanding the Quad fellowship to include students from Southeast Asia," Biden said.


That includes, the leaders’ statement said, a 2025 joint mission by the four nations’ coast guards. That step is also something that Japanese officials presented as a big summit takeaway when briefing reporters earlier in the day. Earlier in the week, when a top U.S. officials previewed the summit, he said the aim is to counter illegal fishing – adding, tellingly, that the vast majority of illegal fishing vessels are Chinese.




VOA asked the Japanese officials about a point of contention between Washington and Tokyo: Biden’s opposition, on national security grounds, to a proposed takeover of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel. Biden administration officials appeared to play down the matter, noting that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States recently extended its review into the deal, pushing any decision past November.


"The president will obviously allow that process to run its course because that’s what’s required from the law, and then we will see what happens," Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, told reporters Saturday.


The American steel company is headquartered in Pennsylvania, an electorally critical state in the fast-approaching U.S. presidential election.


VOA asked the Japanese government to share Toyko’s position on the politically sensitive merger. Japanese officials would not say whether Biden and Kishida even planned to speak on this topic in any of their meetings.


"As a government we refrain from commenting on that," replied a Foreign Affairs Ministry official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. The official quickly added that Japan is the No. 1 investor in the U.S., and that Tokyo hopes the countries’ cooperation will continue.


Australia’s leader said it matters that the four "like-minded countries," all democracies, work together.


"We assert the view that national sovereignty is important, that security and stability is something that we strive for, as well as shared prosperity in our region," Albanese said.


Analysts had predicted China discussion would dominate behind the scenes, but the leaders would refrain from publicly poking Beijing.


"That doesn’t show up in the readouts," Rafiq Dossani, a longtime Asia scholar, told VOA ahead of the summit.


The four leaders began to meet yearly, in person, under Biden’s presidency. Much of their effort, said analyst Kathryn Paik of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, is directed at bread-and-butter governance issues such as health, infrastructure, maritime security and resources, and people-to-people ties.


"This is certainly not a Contain-China club," she told VOA.


But, said Dossani, who is a senior economist at the Rand research corporation and a professor of policy analysis, there is room for the Quad to evolve.


"The question is as the competition, or the rivalry, between China and the U.S. evolves, how will that at that time affect the deliberations?" he said. "As the Chinese economy recovers and they become more assertive, then you'll see a different context for the dialogue."


In the present, though, Biden sees this dialogue among the four leaders as important to his legacy, Paik said.


"It was a central piece to the Indo-Pacific strategy, and elevating the Quad to the leader level has been a significant piece of that strategy," she said. "Just the fact that the Quad has met annually at the leader level every year of Biden's administration is quite significant."


VOA’s Celia Mendoza in Wilmington, Delaware, and Paris Huang and Kim Lewis, in Washington, contributed to this report.

## FBI agents board vessel managed by company whose ship crashed into US bridge

date: 2024-09-22, from: VOA News USA

BALTIMORE  — Federal agents on Saturday boarded a vessel managed by the same company that managed a cargo ship that caused a deadly bridge collapse in Baltimore, Maryland, the FBI confirmed.


In statements, spokespeople for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland confirmed that authorities boarded the Maersk Saltoro. The ship is managed by Synergy Marine Group.


"The Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Criminal Investigation Division and Coast Guard Investigative Services are present aboard the Maersk Saltoro conducting court authorized law enforcement activity," statements from both the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office said Saturday morning.


Authorities did not offer further specifics. The Washington Post first reported on federal authorities boarding the ship.


The raid came several months after investigators conducted a similar search of the Dali, the cargo ship that crashed into the bridge.


In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department alleged that Dali owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and manager Synergy Marine, both of Singapore, recklessly cut corners and ignored known electrical problems on the vessel, which lost power multiple times minutes before it crashed into a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March.




The Justice Department said mechanical and electrical systems on the massive ship had been “jury-rigged” and improperly maintained, culminating in the power outages and a cascade of other failures that left its pilots and crew helpless in the face of looming disaster. The ship was leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss.


Six members of a road work crew were killed when the bridge crumbled into the water. The collapse also snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore for months before the channel was fully reopened in June.


The Justice Department is seeking to recover more than $100 million the government spent to clear the underwater debris and reopen the city’s port.


The companies filed a court petition days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history.


Justice Department officials said there is no legal support for that bid to limit liability and pledged to vigorously contest it.


In its lawsuit, which also seeks punitive damages, the Justice Department argued that vessel owners and operators need to be "deterred from engaging in such reckless and exceedingly harmful behavior."


That includes Grace Ocean and Synergy themselves because the Dali has a "sister ship," authorities wrote in the claim.


The two companies "need to be deterred because they continue to operate their vessels, including a sister ship to the Dali, in U.S. waters and benefit economically from those activities," the lawsuit says.


Darrell Wilson, a Grace Ocean spokesperson, confirmed that the FBI and Coast Guard boarded the Maersk Saltoro in the Port of Baltimore on Saturday morning. Wilson has previously said the owner and manager "look forward to our day in court to set the record straight."


Like the Dali, the Singapore-flagged Saltoro was built by Hyundai in 2015.


According to the Justice Department lawsuit, major issues with the Dali’s electrical system might have resulted from excessive vibrations on the ship that can loosen wires and damage connections. A prior captain of the vessel had reported “heavy vibration” in his handover notes in May 2023, saying he had made similar reports to Synergy in the past, according to the complaint.


The lawsuit noted cracked equipment in the engine room and pieces of cargo shaken loose. The ship’s electrical equipment was in such bad condition that an independent agency stopped further electrical testing because of safety concerns, according to the lawsuit.


The ship had also experienced power outages while it was still docked in Baltimore. Those blackouts are considered “reportable marine casualties” that must be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard, which authorities say never happened.


The Dali, which was stuck amid the wreckage of the collapse for months before it could be extricated and refloated, departed Norfolk, Virginia, on Thursday afternoon en route to China on its first international voyage since the March 26 disaster.


Justice Department officials refused to answer questions Wednesday about whether a criminal investigation into the bridge collapse remains ongoing. FBI agents boarded the Dali in April.

## The sorry state of Java deserialization

date: 2024-09-22, from: Marginallia log

I&rsquo;ve been on a bit of a frustration-driven quest to solve a problem I frequently encounter working on the search engine, that is, reading data from disk.
You&rsquo;d think this would be a pretty basic thing, but doing this in a way that is half-way performant is surprisingly hard and requires avoiding basically all the high level tools at your disposal.
There&rsquo;s a common sentiment that modern hardware is fast, so this may not matter, but we aren&rsquo;t speaking a 30% performance hit, the the question is how many orders of magnitude you&rsquo;re willing to forego.

## pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL: The Next Generation — Introducing pgEdge Platform v24.7, Constellation Release

date: 2024-09-22, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>pgEdge has just released the latest version of its flagship product, pgEdge Platform v24.7, known as the Constellation Release. This update brings a host of new features designed to enhance the capabilities of distributed PostgreSQL databases. Building on its foundation as the only fully distributed PostgreSQL that is open (source code available) and based on standard PostgreSQL, pgEdge continues to lead the way in providing ultra-high availability and reduced latency across geographic regions. The Constellation Release introduces significant improvements, including advanced logical replication features, large object support, and enhanced error handling. These enhancements make pgEdge an even more powerful alternative for legacy multi-master replication technologies, offering greater throughput, flexibility, and control for users.</p>
<p>Key Enhancements in the Constellation Release
1. Large Object Logical Replication (LOLOR): With the new Large Object Logical Replication (LOLOR) feature, pgEdge ensures seamless integration for applications that store media assets and large files in PostgreSQL databases. This extension allows large objects to be compatible with logical replication, facilitating smoother transitions from legacy databases to PostgreSQL without requiring application modifications.  See blog for more details.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Replication Exception Handling and Logging: The latest update includes an advanced error handling and logging mechanism. Replication errors are logged into a new exception table, preventing disruptions in replication processes. This enhancement ensures a robust user experience, offering greater visibility and control over replication errors and making troubleshooting more straightforward. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replication Repair Mode: pgEdge now allows users to enable or disable "repair mode," providing the flexibility to manage replication processes without affecting the entire database cluster. This feature is particularly useful for controlling replication changes during error resolution or node-specific modifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic Replication of DDL Commands: Updating the database schema has never been easier. With the automatic replication of DDL commands, any changes made to a single node are propagated across all nodes in the cluster. This feature simplifies the management of distributed PostgreSQL applications, especially during active development or maintenance.  See blog for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Snowflake Sequence in Postgres Extension: To enhance sequence management in multi-master replication scenarios, pgEdge integrates Snowflake sequences within PostgreSQL. This extension ensures unique sequence numbers across different regions without needing application code or schema modifications, streamlining sequence management and improving scalability.  See blog for details and examples.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Looking Ahead: High Performance Parallel Replication
pgEdge is set to introduce Parallel Replication in Q4 of this year. This feature will leverage multiple replication slots to enable parallel processing within distributed PostgreSQL clusters, significantly boosting replication throughput. It promises to reduce replication lag, ensuring timely data synchronization across nodes and maintaining data consistency even in high-demand environments.</p>
<p>Availability and Support
The pgEdge Platform can be self-hosted on-premise or self-managed in the cloud with providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.  The new Constellation Release is available for download at <a href="https://www.pgedge.com/get-started/platform">https://www.pgedge.com/get-started/platform</a> or can be accessed via GitHub.  pgEdge also offers enterprise-class support. Additionally, pgEdge Cloud, a fully managed service based on the pgEdge Platform, is available in beta and will be generally available in Q3.</p>
