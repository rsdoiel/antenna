NetNewsWire 6.1.6 for Mac is out — do a check for updates or
<a href="https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/releases/download/mac-6.1.6/NetNewsWire6.1.6.zip">download
it directly</a>.
</p>
<p>
The theme of this release is using less bandwidth (and, as a
consequence, less battery). It fixes a
<a href="https://inessential.com/2024/08/03/netnewswire_and_conditional_get_issues.html">conditional
GET issue</a> and it now pays attention to Cache-Control response
headers and 429 response codes.
</p>
<p>
There are also a few other small bug fixes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Restore toolbar button to show and hide the sidebar
</li>
<li>
Add keyboard shortcuts for Copy Article URL and Copy External URL menu
items
</li>
<li>
Fix a few AppleScript support bugs
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note: this version requires macOS 13 and up.
</p>
<p>
Also note: the equivalent update for iOS is in testing — if you’d like
to help, you can
