2023: &quot;When big tech companies say they love open formats and protocols, that means they&#39;re launching something new and they&#39;re just saying that so you relax about their intentions, which haven&#39;t actually changed at all.&quot;

## Why are my live regions not working?

date: 2025-01-08, updated: 2025-01-08, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/05/01/why-are-my-live-regions-not-working/">Why are my live regions not working?</a></strong></p>
Useful article to help understand <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions">ARIA live regions</a>. Short version: you can add a live region to your page like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="notification" aria-live="assertive"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Then any time you use JavaScript to modify the text content in that element it will be announced straight away by any screen readers - that's the "assertive" part. Using "polite" instead will cause the notification to be queued up for when the user is idle instead.</p>
<p>There are quite a few catches. Most notably, the contents of an <code>aria-live</code> region will usually NOT be spoken out loud when the page first loads, or when that element is added to the DOM. You need to ensure the element is available and <em>not hidden</em> before updating it for the effect to work reliably across different screen readers.</p>
<p>I got Claude Artifacts <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/50946b742ef5da7d0435c341b2d6fa8b">to help me</a> build a demo for this, which is now available at <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/aria-live-regions">tools.simonwillison.net/aria-live-regions</a>. The demo includes instructions for turning VoiceOver on and off on both iOS and macOS to help try that out.

## uv python install --reinstall 3.13

date: 2025-01-07, updated: 2025-01-07, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/charliermarsh/status/1876696188130394372">uv python install --reinstall 3.13</a></strong></p>
I couldn't figure out how to upgrade the version of Python 3.13 I had previous installed using <code>uv</code> - I had Python 3.13.0.rc2. Thanks to Charlie Marsh I learned the command for upgrading to the latest uv-supported release:</p>
<pre><code>uv python install --reinstall 3.13
</code></pre>
<p>I can confirm it worked using:</p>
<pre><code>uv run --python 3.13 python -c 'import sys; print(sys.version)'
</code></pre>
<p>Caveat from Zanie Blue on <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/10377#issuecomment-2576353887">my PR to document this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are some caveats we'd need to document here, like this will break existing tool installations (and other virtual environments) that depend on the version. You'd be better off doing <code>uv python install 3.13.X</code> to add the new patch version in addition to the existing one.</p>

## Quoting David Crawshaw

<blockquote cite="https://crawshaw.io/blog/programming-with-llms"><p>I followed this curiosity, to see if a tool that can generate something mostly not wrong most of the time could be a net benefit in my daily work. The answer appears to be yes, generative models are useful for me when I program. It has not been easy to get to this point. My underlying fascination with the new technology is the only way I have managed to figure it out, so I am sympathetic when other engineers claim LLMs are “useless.” But as I have been asked more than once how I can possibly use them effectively, this post is my attempt to describe what I have found so far.</p></blockquote>
