Lawmakers Back in Session, Working on Border Security, Ukraine Aid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers came back into session this week after a
three-week holiday break to continue work toward a deal on border
security in return for Republican votes to send more aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We are closer to an agreement than we have been since the beginning
of these talks,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, one of the lead
negotiators on the deal, told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I wish that we weren’t in this position. I wish that Senate
Republicans supported Ukraine aid because they believe in Ukraine,” he
said. “I wish that we weren’t conditioning support for Ukraine upon the
resolution of the most difficult issue in American politics —
immigration reform.”</p>
<p>The White House’s $106 billion national security supplemental request
also includes funding for border security as well as nearly $14 billion
in aid to Israel and funding for Taiwan to combat the threat posed by
China.</p>
<p>Senate negotiators continued meeting remotely throughout the three
weeks Congress was out of session.</p>
<p>“We are working very hard to come up with an agreement to improve our
situation at the border. But it’s also important to remember the world
is literally at war,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told
reporters Tuesday. “This is the most serious international situation we
have faced since the Berlin Wall came down. We need to pass the
supplemental, and there needs to be a strong border provision part of
it.”</p>
<p>The United States has dedicated more than $100 billion to arming and
supporting Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in
February 2022, and President Joe Biden has asked Congress to approve an
additional $60 billion. Republicans in Congress have become increasingly
skeptical about the need to continue underwriting Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>The Pentagon announced on December 27 a new $250 million security
assistance package for Ukraine, which included additional munitions for
surface-to-air missiles systems, artillery rounds and more air defense
components. The Pentagon still has $4 billion available to provide
Ukraine with military aid, but no funds are available to replenish the
U.S. military’s stockpiles. Officials tell VOA that no new aid packages
are expected until Congress provides more funding.</p>
<p>Republicans in the Senate have conditioned approval of any additional
money for Ukraine on the simultaneous strengthening of immigration rules
aimed at reducing the number of people illegally entering the United
States at its southern border and expelling some who are already in the
country.</p>
<p>According to multiple news organizations, an estimated 300,000 people
crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in December 2023. That estimate marks the
highest recorded number of U.S.-Mexico border crossings.</p>
<p>Even if an agreement passes in the Senate, it might not survive in
the House, where Republicans hold a very narrow majority. A significant
group of Republican House members oppose additional aid to Ukraine, and
the party in early October voted out a speaker who partnered with
Democrats to pass legislation.</p>
<p>Last week, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson led a delegation of 60
House Republicans to visit the U.S.-Mexico border at Eagle Pass,
Texas.</p>
<p>“If President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill focused on
national security, it better begin with defending America’s national
security,” Johnson told reporters at a news conference on the
border.</p>
<p>Republicans have proposed their own legislation, H.R. 2, which would
resume construction of a border wall as well as impose new restrictions
on asylum-seekers.</p>

id="the-east-coast-and-midwest-are-going-to-need-more-electricity">The
East Coast and Midwest Are Going to Need More Electricity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAzNTM3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MzU4NTI4N30.cC-2nVaicUHk15s1g22Hu1nroK_ufwHo60gldotwpwk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
We’re gonna need a bigger electricity generation system. That’s what PJM
Interconnection, the massive electricity market spanning 13 states on
the East Coast and in the
Midwest,<a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/load-forecast/2024-load-report.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
said in a report Monday</a>.
</p>
<p>
PJM predicted that its peak electricity demand would increase every year
by 1.7% in the summer and 2% in the winter. It also anticipates overall
energy use to grow 2.4% annually over the next decade — an increase of
200,000 gigawatt-hours, or roughly 25%, by 2034.
</p>
<p>
That increase in demand is also about three times a previous
forecast,<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/pjm-interconnection-load-forecast-data-center-ev-dominion-firstenergy/704040/" target="_blank">
according to <em>Utility Dive</em></a>. PJM attributes the big jump to a
few factors, calling out specifically data centers, new manufacturing
plants, and more electrification, especially of transportation.
</p>
<p>
The PJM forecast provides a case study for the challenges the Biden
administration faces as it pursues the twin goals of lowering emissions
and decarbonizing the electricity sector, along with trying to revive
American manufacturing.
</p>
<p>
In order to reduce emissions, you can’t just replace fossil fuel-burning
power plants with renewable and non-carbon energy sources. Everything
else that emits carbon has to be decarbonized as well, including
transportation,<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106022#:~:text=and%20economic%20risks.-,The%20transportation%20sector%20is%20the%20largest%20source%20of%20greenhouse%20gas,to%20the%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
which makes up about 30% of emissions</a>.
</p>
<p>
But doing this increases demand for electricity — a car that used to be
powered by igniting gasoline is now powered by a battery that has to be
charged. Electrification will put even more pressure on non-carbon power
generation: not only do some combination of solar panels, wind turbines,
nuclear power plants, dams and steam have to replace existing
electricity demand, it has to make up for that new demand as well.
</p>
<p>
While there are ways to moderate this demand — you can pay consumers to
use less electricity at peak times and have electric car batteries work
as power supply for homes, for example — a world where electric power
replaces combustion will mean we need to find more electricity.
</p>
<p>
That’s no small task. There are about 500,000 electric cars in the PJM
area and the projection is that there will be 23 million by the end of
the next decade, while the number of medium and heavy-duty electric
vehicles will increase from 25,000 to 1.5 million, according to PJM’s
forecast.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s new sources of electricity demand that have nothing to
do with electrification, like,
say,<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/intel-in-ohio.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
a new semiconductor plant outside Columbus</a>, Ohio, being built by
Intel
or<a href="https://quantumloophole.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
data centers in Maryland</a>.
</p>
<p>
Right now, PJM’s existing electric load is serviced by a relatively
dirty grid that’s over half coal and natural gas (although one third
also comes from nuclear). PJM, like many electricity markets, has
expressed worries about how retiring fossil fuel plants could impact the
reliability of the grid as a whole. The new forecast “underscores the
need to maintain and develop enough generation resources to serve that
growing demand,” PJM’s senior vice president for planning Kenneth Seiler
said in a statement.

id="nvidias-g-sync-pulsar-is-anti-blur-monitor-tech-aimed-squarely-at-your-eyeball">Nvidia’s
G-Sync Pulsar is anti-blur monitor tech aimed squarely at your
eyeball</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>Motion blur, when it’s not caused by slow LCD pixel transitions, is
caused by “the persistence of an image on the retina, as our eyes track
movement on-screen,” as Nvidia explains it. Prior improvements in
display tech, like variable rate refresh, Ultra Low Motion Blur, and
Variable Overdrive have helped with the hardware causes of this
deficiency. The eyes and their object permanence, however, can only be
addressed by strobing a monitor’s backlight. You can’t just set that
light blinking, however. Variable strobing frequencies causes flicker,
and timing the strobe to the monitor refresh rate—itself also tied to
the graphics card output—was tricky. Nvidia says it has solved that
issue with its G-Sync Pulsar tech, employing “a novel algorithm” in
“synergizing” its variable refresh smoothing and monitor pulsing. The
result is that pixels are transitioned from one color to another at a
rate that reduces motion blur and pixel ghosting. ↫ Kevin Purdy for Ars
Technica Cool technology, of course, but also another attempt by Nvidia
to put Nvidia-specific chips inside monitors to cash in on royalties and
tie people to Nvidia GPUs. Their previous attempt – G-Sync – was
eventually thwarted, but they’re clearly trying again.</p>

at some level a sign of broken consensus processes and various actors

everywhere in blog posts or tutorials leading to a belief that they are
required for everything. This post is about how to architect Nix

<h2 id="every-single-day-of-2023-was-extraordinarily-hot">Every Single
Day of 2023 Was Extraordinarily Hot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAzNDgzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczODcxODczMX0.n_XHAWmwIPO04IffUjKf6OKnSheXRXNlkQvAie_Mpqg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
You have almost certainly heard already that 2023 was,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/09/climate/2023-warmest-year-record.html" target="_blank">officially</a>,
the hottest year on record. That announcement came this morning from
<a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-2023-hottest-year-record" target="_blank">Copernicus</a>,
the European Union’s Earth data service.
</p>
<p>
There was another figure in that announcement, however, that caught my
eye: 2023 was also the first year in which every single day was at least
1 degree Celsius hotter than the pre-industrial average.
</p>
<center>

</p>
</center>
<p>
That is a marked contrast to 2022, our sixth hottest year on record,
which had several days less than 1 degree above the pre-industrial
average and a maximum temperature difference around half a degree lower
than last year’s.<br/>

</p>
</center>
<p>
Just for kicks, I decided to make the same chart for 1940, the earliest
year represented in this particular dataset. As you will perhaps notice,
I had to adjust the scale to account for temperatures <em>below</em> the
pre-industrial average.<br/>

id="cyber-kidnapping-scams-target-chinese-students-around-the-world">Cyber
‘Kidnapping’ Scams Target Chinese Students Around the World</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A recent cyber kidnapping incident involving a Chinese
exchange student in Utah appears to be part of an international pattern
in which unknown perpetrators, often masquerading as Chinese police or
government officials, target Chinese students around the world and
extort their families for upwards of tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>In late December, 17-year-old Chinese student Kai Zhuang was reported
missing near Salt Lake City, only to be found days later alone and
freezing in a tent in the mountains. Authorities have said the case was
part of an apparent cyber kidnapping scheme to scam his family in China
out of $80,000.</p>
<p>Cyber kidnapping is when perpetrators pretend to have abducted
someone to coerce their family into paying a ransom.</p>
<p>“At the heart of it are the heartstrings of the victim, who is told
to go run and hide, and the heartstrings of the people who think their
loved one is actually in the possession of kidnappers,” said Theresa
Payton, CEO of cybersecurity company Fortalice Solutions.</p>
<p>“Virtual kidnapping is, at its very root, manipulative. It is
coercive. It is emotionally draining and complex,” said Payton, who is
based in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
<p>On January 3, just days after Kai Zhuang was found, the FBI issued a
warning about criminals impersonating Chinese police officers to defraud
Chinese people based in the United States, especially Chinese
students.</p>
<p>Around the world</p>
<p>VOA has learned that the cyber scams aren’t targeting only Chinese
students studying in the United States.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Chinese students studying abroad in Australia,
Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan have also been targeted by cyber
kidnapping scams and other cybercrime schemes, VOA found.</p>
<p>In these countries, the perpetrators also often pretended to be
Chinese police officers or government officials. Cybersecurity experts
said this tactic indicates criminals are leveraging China’s
authoritarian system, in which deference to and fear of the police are
the norm, to their advantage.</p>
<p>“Chinese people are naturally afraid of the police,” said Han Jiang
Du Diao Seng, a pharmacist based in the United States who runs accounts
on YouTube and Weibo that are popular among Chinese exchange
students.</p>
<p>Han Jiang Du Diao Seng has helped four Chinese students caught up in
cyber kidnapping scams, he said. In his experience, he said, scammers
posing as government officials tend to approach Chinese students and
first ask if they recently received money from their family in
China.</p>
<p>If the student says yes, he said, the scammer either claims the money
was transferred illegally or that their family is being targeted by
criminals, before requiring the student to halt contact with their
family during an investigation — all of which is a ploy to then extort
money from the family.</p>
<p>Left their homes</p>
<p>In the incidents Han Jiang Du Diao Seng worked on, he said, the
criminals coerced all the students to leave where they lived and go stay
at a hotel, which helped convince their parents that they were actually
kidnapped.</p>
<p>He said that these criminals may be taking advantage of the fact that
Chinese parents may be less likely to report the incidents to American
police — in part due to language barriers but also due to general
distrust among Chinese people of the American police. Chinese state
media regularly depict American police as violent and irresponsible.</p>
<p>“You have a fear of government involvement and law enforcement
involvement because the relationship to the government is different,”
cybersecurity expert Joseph Steinberg said, referring to people from
authoritarian countries such as China.</p>
<p>There is no clear data on the number of cyber kidnapping cases in the
United States or around the world, cybersecurity experts told VOA, but
incidents seem to be rising. Technological advancements, particularly
with artificial intelligence, risk making the schemes even easier to
perpetrate, they said.</p>
<p>There are different tiers of sophistication in these cybercrime
syndicates, according to Payton. At the lower end, perpetrators may use
an auto dialer to target random people in hopes of getting a few hundred
dollars, she said.</p>
<p>More sophisticated schemes</p>
<p>At the upper end, perpetrators use artificial intelligence algorithms
to identify targets and deepfake technology to create photos and audio
intended to make victims believe their loved one has actually been
kidnapped, Payton said.</p>
<p>“You do not actually have to be technically minded to get into this
type of crime. You just have to be a twisted, evil individual,” she
said.</p>
<p>AI advancements mean perpetrators don’t even need to speak the same
language as their victims, according to Steinberg, who is based in New
York City.</p>
<p>“AI is only going to get better, and that means that the attacks will
only be more and more realistic,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Some cybercriminals are just after a quick buck, Steinberg said. “But
you have some that are after the big dollars and will spend the time to
do the research,” he said.</p>
<p>That may help explain why Chinese exchange students apparently are
being specifically targeted.</p>
<p>Payton said that given the complex relationship between the Chinese
government and its citizens, as well as other factors such as culture,
history and economics, “it is conceivable that global criminal
syndicates engaging in such activities as virtual kidnapping may
perceive young Chinese adults studying abroad as more susceptible to
fall prey to this crime,” Payton said.</p>
<p>In Canada in February 2023, regional police said Chinese students had
been swindled out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by scammers
claiming to be Chinese government officials.</p>
<p>Similar incidents have played out in Australia, Japan and the United
Kingdom. It is not clear whether the perpetrators of any of these crimes
are linked in any way. The investigation into the recent Utah incident
is ongoing, and it is not clear whether the perpetrators imitated
Chinese officials.</p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington did not respond to that question when
VOA reached out for comment.</p>
<p>Warnings from embassies and police</p>
<p>The embassy did urge Chinese citizens in the U.S., especially those
studying in the country, to boost safety awareness, take necessary
precautions, and stay vigilant against “virtual kidnapping” and other
forms of telecom and online fraud.</p>
<p>In the span of two months in Japan last summer, at least six Chinese
students were targeted in cyber kidnapping schemes, local police said.
The Chinese Embassy in Tokyo issued a warning about the scams in August,
urging Chinese citizens in the country to “be wary” and “vigilant.”</p>
<p>Local British police issued a warning about cyber scams targeting
Chinese students in September, and the Australian government released a
similar warning a month later.</p>
<p>“These criminal syndicates demonstrate a profound understanding of
human behavior, potentially leveraging fear tactics to manipulate
individuals into compliance and their families into making payments.
They are targeting all demographics, but the trend appears to indicate
they favor targeting Chinese exchange students studying abroad,” Payton
said.</p>
<p>To avoid falling victim to these kinds of schemes, cybersecurity
experts recommended families set up a password to verify one another’s
identity over the phone during these kinds of scenarios.</p>
<p>“The cyber kidnapping scam very much can happen to anybody, and
that’s what people need to be aware of,” Steinberg said.</p>

<h2 id="us-delays-planned-return-of-astronauts-to-moon-until-2026">US
Delays Planned Return of Astronauts to Moon Until 2026</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States is pushing back its planned return of
astronauts to the surface of the Moon from 2025 to 2026, NASA
Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Artemis, named after the sister of Apollo in Greek mythology, was
officially announced in 2017 as part of the US space agency’s plans to
establish a sustained presence on Earth’s nearest space neighbor, and
apply lessons learned there for a future mission to Mars.</p>
<p>Its first mission, an uncrewed test flight to the Moon and back
called Artemis 1, took place in 2022, after several postponements.</p>
<p>Artemis 2, involving a crew that doesn’t land on the surface, has
been postponed from later this year to September 2025, Nelson told
reporters.</p>
<p>Artemis 3, in which the first woman and first person of color are to
set foot on lunar soil at the Moon’s south pole, should now take place
in September 2026.</p>
<p>“Safety is our top priority, and to give Artemis teams more time to
work through the challenges,” said Nelson.</p>
<p>NASA is also looking to build a lunar space station called Gateway
where spacecraft will dock during later missions.</p>
<p>Elon Musk’s SpaceX has won the contract for a landing system for
Artemis 3 based on a version of its prototype Starship rocket, which
remains far from ready. Both of its orbital tests have ended in
explosions.</p>
<p>Delays to Starship have knock-on effects because the spacesuit
contractor needs to know how the suits will interface with the
spacecraft, and simulators need to be built for astronauts to learn its
systems.</p>
<p>And the Artemis 1 mission itself revealed technical issues, such as
the heat shield on the Orion crew capsule eroded in an unexpected way,
and the ground structure used to launch the giant SLS rocket sustained
more damage than expected.</p>
<p>As of March 2023, NASA has agreed to pay approximately $40 billion to
hundreds of contractors in support of Artemis, the same watchdog
found.</p>
<p>A key difference between the 20th-century Apollo missions and the
Artemis era is the increasing role of commercial partnerships, part of a
broader strategy to involve the private companies in space exploration
to reduce costs and to make space more accessible.</p>

<h2 id="quotes-from-moving-house">Quotes from moving house</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<img src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/moving.jpg" width="1200" height="630" alt="drawing of a cardboard box and some bubble wrap in an empty room">
<p>
I’ve moved house over sixteen times in my lifetime (more if you count
step-homes). Apartment to house, city to city, state to state, country
to country; I’ve done it all. I’ve even lived in a couple
pseudo-communes with over 6+ roommates. Thinking back, I realized I have
little phrases –some synesthetic little audio cues– attached to each
major life change. Here’s a handful of my favorites.
</p>
<h2>
“Always WATCH YOUR BACK.”
</h2>
<p>
In 2003 I got accepted to JET Programme and would be moving to Japan for
one to three years. You apply in December, interview in January, get
accepted in April, and leave in July. It’s a sudden transition for an
overseas move. In April I found out I’d be living in a small town called
Sasayama in Hyogo Prefecture. It looked cute, had a castle, and the
town’s website had an animated gif of a dancing mayor. Part of the JET
Programme’s tradition is that your predecessor writes you a little note
introducing the town and job before you arrive. In July I got an email
and inside was the following phrase repeated seven times…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Always WATCH YOUR BACK.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yikes. It’s two weeks or so before I board a plane to live in a country
I’ve never even visited. Although self-evident by the tone of the
letter, I later learned my predecessor had a hard time in our small
town. She entered a relationship with another JET teacher and when they
wanted to live together that caused a local stir where city hall got
involved. That’s small town life for you.
</p>
<p>
What an ominous letter to get before you move overseas!
</p>
<h2>
“Do you like breakfast?”
</h2>
<p>
We rolled up to our house in South Austin in a bright yellow Penske
truck. We trekked across the desert from California and would officially
become homeowners that day. As we were unloading the truck a neighbor in
her mid seventies stepped out to meet us. She was so kind and after some
small talk she asked a question I’ll never forget…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Do you like breakfast?”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And that began almost 9 years of weekly breakfasts at Dan’s Hamburgers
with our neighbor Cleo. She’s more than a sweet grandmotherly neighbor
to our children, she was their best friend. Every day my kids would wake
up and demand to go see Cleo.
</p>
<p>
I also can’t forget our eighty year old neighbor Nellie’s big entrance
after meeting Cleo. Fresh from cataracts surgery wearing a night gown
and an eye-patch, she stumbled across her yard into the street to start
giving us all the gossip we could ask for on the neighborhood. “That’s
old Gene and his wife died…”, “She’s an old maid…”, and another line
I’ll never forget…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Tread lightly with them over there…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
About as Texan as it gets. We stayed in that house nine years and saw
the street turnover. We outgrew our 2 bedroom/2 bath house, so we moved
north in 2018. There’s lots to miss about the old place (big yard,
proximity to Dan’s Hamburgers), but we miss our friend Cleo the most.
</p>
<h2>
“We mow our lawns and decorate for Halloween”
</h2>
<p>
When I introduced myself to my new neighbor in North Austin, she was
friendly but a bit somber as she mentioned her husband passed away six
months prior. She welcomed us to the neighborhood, asked about our kids,
and then proceeded to lay out the two ground rules for the street…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We mow our lawns and decorate for Halloween.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I felt shame looking down at my unkempt yard. She handed me a business
card for her mowers and I hired them that day. And she wasn’t kidding
about Halloween. Our street is basically <em>the</em> street in the
neighborhood for Halloween. We have a 9-foot tall inflatable Beetlejuice
sand worm in our yard every October, so I like to think we’re fulfilling
our neighborly obligations… but my yard still looks like shit.

Happened When Solar Installers in New York Tried to Unionize</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAwNDM1My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNDgwNDQzOH0.eBm8O5DZ6GeVDdAZBopDaJGAZpWYNeZ69uQtkreFIdQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
President Biden’s pitch to get the American public behind the transition
to clean energy is that it will bring good-paying, high-quality jobs —
union jobs. But so far, that’s been more true in some areas than others.
</p>
<p>
When Daniel Lozano first got hired at EmPower Solar, a rooftop solar
installation company on Long Island last April, he thought he had landed
a pretty sweet gig. He was 24, with a background in electrical work and
construction, and was attracted by the company’s summer schedule of four
tens — four-day work weeks, ten hours per day.
</p>
<p>
But soon it became clear the job wasn’t as ideal as it seemed. Extreme
pressure from management to finish installations as quickly as possible
was wearing people down. Workers felt overworked and underpaid. An
opaque bonus system and frequent firing and hiring created an atmosphere
of anxiety. Vacation requests took months to approve. Lozano grew
especially frustrated that his manager kept delaying his scheduled
performance review — and therefore his prospects for a raise.
</p>
<p>
All the while, Lozano watched as the UPS Teamsters and the United Auto
Workers were waging historic campaigns to try to increase pay for their
workers. Inspired by their success, he began trying to organize at
EmPower.
</p>
<p>
“We don’t want to be treated like dogs that are just pushed and pushed
and pushed and then let go like used rags,” he told me. “We can make
this a good place to work.”
</p>
<p>
The number of solar workers represented by a union has been creeping up
over the last decade, reaching about 10.5% of the workforce in 2022,
according to the most recent
<a href="https://irecusa.org/census-executive-summary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National
Solar Jobs Census</a>. By comparison, about 16% of autoworkers and about
48% of electric power line workers were members of a union that year,
according to the
<a href="https://unionstats.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Union
Membership and Coverage Database</a>, which is built on federal data.
</p>
<p>
But most union clean energy work is on big commercial projects like
utility-scale solar farms, where developers have to pay prevailing
wages, use apprentices, or enter into project labor agreements in order
to qualify for state and federal subsidies. Union representation is much
more unusual in residential work like rooftop solar, where rebates and
tax credits typically have no labor requirements.
</p>
<p>
Residential construction is a fragmented industry, with lots of small
businesses that employ only a handful of people. In some ways, EmPower
stands out in this field. The company has a staff of more than 100 and
offers full benefits like paid time off, health insurance, and a 401k
retirement plan. But many of the complaints workers had about EmPower
are common in the industry. A
<a href="https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Putting-California-on-the-High-Road.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2020
report</a> by the California Workforce Development Board, for example,
says that rooftop solar and energy efficiency jobs there “are
characterized by low wages” and “lack of career ladders.”
</p>
<p>
The primary union for solar workers to date has been the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. But Lozano thought the group seemed
stagnant — its leadership wasn’t out there the way that Shawn Fain, the
progressive UAW president, was, fighting for its workers in the national
spotlight, Lozano said. So instead, in September, he went to see if his
local UAW chapter would represent EmPower workers. They agreed. Next,
Lozano began gathering support from his coworkers and soon had enough to
schedule an official vote with the National Labor Relations Board.
</p>
<p>
The company’s leadership did not welcome the organizing effort. In the
weeks leading up to the vote, EmPower hired National Labor Relations
Advocates, a strategy firm that
<a href="https://nlradvocates.com/union-election-campaigns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">promises</a>,
“within 24 hours of being retained,” to “arm you with the tools you need
and bring our experience and 96% success rate in keeping our clients
union-free.” According to Lozano and other workers, management began
visiting job sites with coffee and donuts and asking about their
concerns. They said the company was a family, and that any issues they
had would be resolved more slowly with a union, not faster.
</p>
<p>
The workers weren’t convinced. On December 22, EmPower’s installers and
service technicians voted 29 to 16 in favor of unionizing.
</p>
<p>
One week later, on the Friday before the new year, the company notified
21 workers — including Lozano — that they were being put on unpaid
leave, some for more than a year. Michael DiGiuseppe, the vice president
of UAW Local 259, accused the company of illegally retaliating against
the unionization effort and filed charges with the National Labor
Relations Board.
</p>
<p>
“One week out, we wanted to find collaborative bargaining priorities,
and instead of doing that, they went out and laid off 21 guys,”
DiGiuseppe told me.
</p>
<p>
EmPower said it furloughed the workers because business typically slows
down in the winter, and the company took a particularly hard hit in 2023
due to soaring interest rates and inflation. (It is continuing to
provide health insurance for those who were furloughed.) But regardless
of whether the layoffs were retaliatory, they still violated the
National Labor Relations Act, according to DiGiuseppe. Once workers have
voted to unionize, an employer is not allowed to make any changes to the
covered workers’ terms or conditions without notifying and negotiating
with the union, even if the changes are pure business decisions. “At a
minimum, they should have communicated with us that they were laying off
workers,” DiGiuseppe said.
</p>
<p>
I spoke with three other field workers from EmPower, in addition to
Lozano, who had been with the company for several years, and had also
been furloughed. When I asked why they wanted to unionize, the workers,
who requested not to be named, echoed many of Lozano’s grievances. They
described an atmosphere of pressure to work fast, even in riskier
situations, such as when they were installing panels on steeply pitched
roofs or working with electrical equipment in the rain. They didn’t like
that they were blamed, yelled at, and sometimes docked pay when things
broke or went wrong. Many of their complaints were around compensation,
including not being paid for travel time or for taking on additional
responsibilities. One of the workers, like Lozano, was frustrated by
performance review delays that left no clear pathway to a raise. Another
described how the company awarded bonuses to workers based on their
speed and adherence to safety protocols, but said the scoring system was
mysterious and seemed to be inconsistent from job to job.
</p>
<p>
In general, the workers told me, they liked their jobs at EmPower and
wanted to stay there, but were seeking more transparency,
accountability, and standardization.
</p>
<p>
David Schieren, the CEO of EmPower and chairman of the New York State
Solar Energy Industry Association, rejected the workers’
characterization of the company. When I asked about the pressure to work
quickly, Schieren said this was the nature of running a customer-centric
business. “We have one boss,” he told me. “The boss is the consumer.
They tell us, do we want to work with this company or not? Are they
happy or are they not?”
</p>
<p>
If workers were uncomfortable with the pace, Schieren went on, then
maybe this wasn’t the right job for them. “We are hungry, we do
efficient work, we’re productive,” he said. “So that’s what I think we
promote here at EmPower. I think that a lot of employees feel that they
thrive in that environment. Is everybody right for a highly productive
company? I don’t know, maybe some people don’t want that.”
</p>
<p>
Schieren said the company had a track record of upward mobility,
including promoting 20 field team members to leadership in recent years,
and that workers had an average tenure with the company of more than 5
years. He declined to weigh in on whether he supported having a union at
his company. When I asked whether he thought unionization threatened the
business, he said no.
</p>
<p>
There is
<a href="https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/prevailing-wage-in-solar-can-deliver-good-jobs-while-keeping-growth-on-track/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a>
showing that paying solar workers prevailing wages does not
significantly increase the cost of solar. But there’s another calculus
to consider in all of this, beyond the economics of any one company or
technology. Proponents of unionization — including those in the federal
government —
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/policy/articles/good-jobs-good-pay-and-benefits-are-key-building-clean-energy-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">say</a>
that making sure clean energy jobs are good jobs is essential to
building the political will to address the climate crisis.
</p>
<p>
As we enter the next stage of the transition, where climate solutions
like electric vehicles and wind turbines are becoming increasingly
politicized and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/texas-grid-cold-uri" target="_self">one
bad power outage</a> can invite endless litigation over the reliability
of renewables, clean energy companies may want workers on their side.

School Shooting: ‘Get over it’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Dan Rather’s Steady</p>
<p>You may have missed the headline because it has become so
horrifically commonplace: children shot at school. The dateline was the
small town of Perry, Iowa. Last Thursday, a high school student opened
fire in his school cafeteria, killing one person and injuring seven
before dying by suicide. We’re barely a week into the new year and
already four,</p>

<p>Free speech is a constitutional right in the United States, but it
only protects against censorship by the government. Social media

<h2 id="half-the-world-to-vote-in-2024-with-global-ramifications">Half
the World to Vote in 2024, With Global Ramifications</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — 2024 will pose a major test of democratic rule as an
estimated 4 billion people in more than 50 nations — almost half the
world’s population — are set to vote in national elections, with the
outcomes likely to shape global politics for years or decades to
come.</p>
<p>Bangladesh began 2024 with the first major election of the year as
Sheikh Hasina won a fourth consecutive term as prime minister Sunday.
Opposition parties boycotted the vote over complaints that it was
neither free nor fair.</p>
<p>A crucial presidential election is due to take place on the
self-governing island of Taiwan on January 13. China’s threat to retake
the island by force looms over the vote, with political parties divided
on how to approach Beijing.</p>
<p>“We are not only choosing Taiwan’s future leaders to decide on the
country’s future but also deciding on the peace and stability of the
Indo-Pacific region,” William Lai, the presidential candidate for the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, told supporters at a campaign rally
earlier this month. Lai is ahead in the polls.</p>
<p>In February, Indonesia is set to choose a new president to rule the
nation of 277 million people, making it one of the world’s biggest votes
held on a single day.</p>
<p>Pakistan will hold parliamentary elections in February; opposition
leader and former Prime Minister Imran Khan remains jailed on charges of
leaking state secrets, which he denies.</p>
<p>Russians will vote in presidential elections in March — although
observers predict incumbent Vladimir Putin is all but certain to win as
he is able to control the electoral process and state media.</p>
<p>“Putin is not going to have any genuine opponents,” said Ian Bond of
the Center for European Reform. “He has control of all the
administrative machinery required to make sure that a crushing vote in
favor of him is delivered and we get another six years of Putin up to at
least 2030.”</p>
<p>Largest democracy</p>
<p>India — the world’s biggest democracy — will hold parliamentary
elections in April and May, with the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP,
under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ahead in the polls.</p>
<p>Veteran Indian political journalist Pushp Saraf believes the
opposition will struggle to make headway.</p>
<p>“It all depends how united they are,” Saraf said. “Otherwise, if they
stay disunited, as they appear to be many times, they have little chance
of succeeding against BJP, which is organizationally very strong, and
with Narendra Modi, who is riding high on the popularity wave, at least
in the Hindi heartland.”</p>
<p>“These are very significant elections because there are clearly two
opinions in the country at the moment. One is that BJP is polarizing
society along the communal lines. And on the other hand, there is the
opinion that BJP is focusing more on national security,” Saraf told The
Associated Press.</p>
<p>On June 2, Mexico is due to hold its presidential election, which
could herald a new milestone for the country, “because of the
possibility that, for the first time, a woman will govern Mexico,”
according to Mexican pollster Patricio Morelos. Mexico’s ruling party
has selected Claudia Sheinbaum, a former mayor of Mexico City, as its
candidate.</p>
<p>The European Union, representing more than half-a-billion people, is
set to hold parliamentary elections in June. Polls suggest a resurgence
in support for right-wing populist parties in many countries, including
France, Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>“There is a real possibility, I think, that the far right will do
well in European elections. Not to the point of running the European
Parliament, but conceivably to the point where anyone who wants to run
the European Parliament has to take account of what they’re saying and
doing,” Anand Menon, professor of international politics at Kings
College London, told VOA.</p>
<p>Britain is scheduled to hold elections before the end of the year,
with polls suggesting opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer is on
course to end a tumultuous 14 years of Conservative rule, with five
different prime ministers.</p>
<p>“We had the Brexit wars that dominated everything, then we had
COVID-19, now we’ve got the cost-of-living crisis. We’ve had government
instability… the instability itself has become a political issue,” Menon
said.</p>
<p>On November 5, the United States is due to hold a highly anticipated
presidential election as Americans decide whether to give Democrat Joe
Biden a second term as U.S. president or choose a Republican
alternative, with Donald Trump seemingly his most likely opponent —
although the challenger faces numerous legal hurdles in the run up to
the vote.</p>
<p>Worldwide effects</p>
<p>The impact of many of these elections in 2024 will likely be felt
around the world, said analyst Menon.</p>
<p>“Yes, all politics is local — but there are global trends.
Immigration is going to figure a lot in many elections around the world.
It will figure in the U.S. election, it will figure in the European
elections, it will figure in the U.K. election,” Memon said.</p>
<p>“Insecurity will be a major factor. One of the things we’re living
with in the West now is an increased sense of insecurity, both economic
— but also in security terms, given the war that’s going on in Ukraine
and given the doubts about what the Taiwanese election later this month
might mean for Taiwan-Chinese relations.</p>
<p>“So, there are common factors, but those are refracted through the
prism of the local and domestic in each country, so they play out in
different ways,” Menon said.</p>

Kelly and Zach Weinersmith’s “A City On Mars” (09 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Kelly and Zach Weinersmith’s “A City On Mars”: Life in
space sucks, is grotesquely expensive, and produces little useful
science. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history:
2004, 2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Kelly and Zach
Weinersmith’s “A City On Mars” (permalink) In A City On Mars, biologist
Kelly Weinersmith and cartoonist Zach Weinersmith set out to investigate
the governance challenges of the impending space settlements they were
told were just over the horizon. Instead, they discovered that humans
aren’t going to be settling space for a very long time, and so they
wrote a book about that instead: https://www.acityonmars.com/ The
Weinersmiths make the (convincing) case that ever aspect of space
settlement is vastly beyond our current or reasonably foreseeable
technical capability. What’s more, every argument in favor of pursuing
space settlement is errant nonsense. And finally: all the energy we are
putting into space settlement actually holds back real space science,
which offers numerous benefits to our species and planet (and is just
darned cool). Every place we might settle in space – giant rotating
rings, the Moon, Mars – is vastly more hostile than Earth. Not just more
hostile than Earth as it stands today – the most degraded,
climate-wracked, nuke-blasted Earth you can imagine is a paradise of
habitability compared to anything else. Mars is covered in poison and
the sky disappears under planet-sized storms that go on and on. The Moon
is covered in black-lung-causing, razor-sharp, electrostatically charged
dust. Everything is radioactive. There’s virtually no water. There are
temperature swings of hundreds of degrees every couple of hours or
weeks. You’re completely out of range of resupply, emergency help, or,
you know, air. There’s Helium 3 on the Moon, but not much of it, and
there is no universe in which is it cheaper to mine for Helium 3 on the
Moon than it is to mine for it on Earth. That’s generally true of
anything we might bring back from space, up to and including
continent-sized chunks of asteroid platinum. Going to space doesn’t end
war. The countries that have gone to space are among the most militarily
belligerent in human history. The people who’ve been to space have come
back perfectly prepared to wage war. Going to space won’t save us from
the climate emergency. The unimaginably vast trove of material and the
energy and advanced technology needed to lift it off Earth and get it to
Mars is orders of magnitude more material and energy than we would need
to resolve the actual climate emergency here. We aren’t anywhere near
being a “multiplanetary species.” The number of humans you need in a
colony to establish a new population is hard to estimate, but it’s very
large. Larger than we can foreseeably establish on the Moon, on Mars, or
on a space-station. But even if we could establish such a colony,
there’s little evidence that it could sustain itself – not only are we a
very, very long way off from such a population being able to satisfy its
material needs off-planet, but we have little reason to believe that
children could gestate, be born, and grow to adulthood off-planet. To
top it all off, there’s space law – the inciting subject matter for this
excellent book. There’s a lot of space law, and while there are some
areas of ambiguity, the claims of would-be space entrepreneurs about how
their plans are permissible under the settled parts of space law don’t
hold up. But those claims are robust compared to claims that space law
will simply sublimate into its constituent molecules when exposed to the
reality of space travel, space settlement, and (most importantly) space
extraction. Space law doesn’t exist in a vacuum (rimshot). It is
parallel to – and shares history with – laws regarding Antarctica, the
ocean’s surface, and the ocean’s floor. These laws relate to territories
that are both vastly easier to access and far more densely populated by
valuable natural resources. The fact that they remain operative in the
face of economic imperatives demands that space settlement advocates
offer a more convincing account than “money talks, bullshit walks, space
law is toast the minute we land on a $14 quadrillion platinum asteroid.”
The Weinersmiths have such an account in defense of space law: namely,
that space law, and its terrestrial analogs, constitute a durable means
of resolving conflicts that would otherwise give rise to outcomes that
are far worse for science, entrepreneurship, human thriving or
nation-building than the impediments these laws represent. What’s more,
space law is enforceable. Not only would any space settlement be
terribly, urgently dependent on support from Earth for the
long-foreseeable future, but every asteroid miner, Lunar He3 exporter
and Martian potato-farmer hoping to monetize their products would have
an enforcement nexus with a terrestrial nation and thus the courts of
that nation. But the Weinersmiths aren’t anti-space. They aren’t even
anti-space-settlement. Rather, they argue that the path to space-based
scientific breakthroughs, exploration of our solar system, and a deeper
understanding of our moral standing in a vast universe cannot start with
space settlements. Landing people on the Moon or Mars any time soon is a
stunt – a very, very expensive stunt. These boondoggles aren’t just
terribly risky (though they are – people who attempt space settlement
are very likely to die horribly and after not very long), they come with
price-tags that would pay for meaningful space science. For the price of
a crewed return trip to Mars, you could put multiple robots onto every
significant object in our solar system, and pilot an appreciable fleet
of these robot explorers back to Earth with samples. For the cost of a
tiny, fraught, lethal Moon-base, we could create hundreds of experiments
in creating efficient, long-term, closed biospheres for human life.
That’s the crux of the Weinersmiths’ argument: if you want to establish
space settlements, you need to do a bunch of other stuff first, like
figure out life-support, learn more about our celestial neighbors, and
vastly improve our robotics. If you want to create stable
space-settlements, you’ll need to create robust governance systems –
space law that you can count on, rather than space law that you plan on
shoving out the airlock. If you want humans to reproduce in space – a
necessary precondition for a space settlement that lasts more than a
single human lifespan – then we need to do things like breed multiple
generations of rodents and other animals, on space stations. Space is
amazing. Space science is amazing. Crewed scientific space missions are
amazing. But space isn’t amazing because it offers a “Plan B” for an
Earth that is imperiled by humanity’s recklessness. Space isn’t amazing
because it offers unparalleled material wealth, or unlimited energy, or
a chance to live without laws or governance. It’s not amazing because it
will end war by mixing the sensawunda of the “Pale Blue Dot” with the
lebensraum of an infinite universe. A science-driven approach to space
offers many dividends for our species and planet. If we can figure out
how to extract resources as dispersed as Lunar He3 or asteroid ice,
we’ll have solved problems like extracting tons of gold from the ocean
or conflict minerals from landfill sites, these being several orders of
magnitude more resource-dense than space. If we can figure out how to
create self-sustaining terraria for large human populations in the
radiation-, heat- and cold-blasted environs of space, we will have
learned vital things about our own planet’s ecosystems. If we can build
the robots that are necessary for supporting a space society, we will
have learned how to build robots that take up the most dangerous and
unpleasant tasks that human workers perform on Earth today. In other
words, it’s not just that we should solve Earth’s problems before
attempting space settlement – it’s that we can’t settle space until we
figure out the solutions to Earth’s problems. Earth’s problems are far
simpler than the problems of space settlement. As I read the
Weinersmiths’ critique of space settlement, I kept thinking of the
pointless AI debates I keep getting dragged into. Arguments for space
settlement that turn on existential risks (like humanity being wiped out
by comets, sunspots, nuclear armageddon or climate collapse) sound an
awful lot like the arguments about “AI safety” – the “risk” that the
plausible sentence generator is on the verge of becoming conscious and
turning us all into paperclips. Both arguments are part of a sales-pitch
for investment in commercial ventures that have no plausible commercial
case, but whose backers are hoping to get rich anyway, and are (often)
sincerely besotted with their own fantasies:
https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/
Both AI and space settlement pass over the real risks, such as the
climate consequences of their deployment, or the labor conditions
associated with their production. After all, when you’re heading off
existential risk, you don’t stop to worry about some carbon emissions or
wage theft. And critically, both ignore the useful (but resolutely
noncommercial) ways that AI or space science can benefit our species. AI
radiology analysis might be useful as an adjunct to human radiological
analysis, but that is more expensive, not less. Space science might help
us learn to use our materials more efficiently on Earth, and that will
come long before anyone makes rendezvous with a $14 quadrillion platinum
asteroid. There are beneficial uses for LLMs. When the Human Rights Data
Analysis Group uses an LLM to help the Innocence Project New Orleans
extract and categorize officer information from wrongful conviction
records, they are doing something valuable and important:
https://hrdag.org/tech-notes/large-language-models-IPNO.html It’s
socially important work, a form of automation that is an unalloyed good,
but you won’t hear about it from LLM advocates. No one is gonna get rich
on improving the efficiency of overturning wrongful convictions with
natural language processing. You can’t inflate a stock bubble with the
Innocence Project. By the same token, learning about improving
gestational health by breeding multigenerational mouse families in
geosynchronous orbit is no way to get a billionaire tech baron to commit
$250 billion to space science. But that’s not an argument against
emphasizing real science that really benefits our whole species. It’s an
argument for taking away capital allocation authority from tech
billionaires. I’m a science fiction writer. I love stories about space.
But I can distinguish fantasy from reality and thought experiments from
suggestions. Kim Stanley Robinson’s 2015 novel Aurora – about failed
space settlement – is every bit as fascinating and inspirational as
“golden age” sf:
https://memex.craphound.com/2015/11/02/kim-stanley-robinsons-aurora-space-is-bigger-than-you-think/
But still, it inspired howls of outrage from would-be space colonists.
So much so that Stan wrote a brilliant essay explaining what we were all
missing about space settlement, which I published:
https://boingboing.net/2015/11/16/our-generation-ships-will-sink.html
With City on Mars, the Weinersmiths aren’t making the case for giving up
on space, nor are they trying to strip space of its romance and
excitement. They’re trying to get us to focus on the beneficial,
exciting, serious space science we can do right now, not just because
it’s attainable and useful – but because it is a necessary precondition
for any actual space settlement in the distant future. Hey look at this

<p>
The <a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">MNT

If iFixIt did a teardown, they’d probably give it an 11 out of 10.
</p>
<p>
You can replace <em>individual battery cells!</em> Some people with
these laptops hacked in their own speakers, added more internal
Ethernet, or even swapped out the CPU itself.
</p>
<p>
Does that mean I think you should buy it? No, probably not. It’s
expensive (<a href="https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform">starting
at €1199</a>), and it’s built for a certain type of person. It’s not
gonna replace a MacBook or a cheap Chromebook.

<p>
But why does this exist, and why am I excited about it?

<h3>
Cruise
</h3>
The most obvious symptom is the implosion of General Motors’ Cruise
robotaxi division. Brad Templeton worked on autonomy at Waymo and is an
enthusiast for the technology. But in
<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2023/12/28/robocar-2023-in-review-the-fall-of-cruise/"><i>Robocar
2023 In Review: The Fall Of Cruise</i></a> he acknowledges that things
aren’t going well:<br />
<blockquote>
Looking at 2023 in review for self-driving cars, one story stands out as
the clear top story of the year, namely the fall of General Motors’
“Cruise” robotaxi division, which led to a pause of operations for
Cruise over the whole USA, a ban on operations in California, the
resignation of the founder/CEO and much more. That was actually the most
prominent component of the other big story of the year, namely the
battle between San Francisco and both Cruise and Waymo.<br /> <br />
Even this serious mistake should not have and perhaps would not have
driven Cruise to its fate. The bigger mistake was they did not want to
talk about it. They were eager to show the car’s recorded video of
events to the press, and to officials, but only over Zoom. They did not
mention the dragging, even when asked about it. I did not ask to see the
part of the video after the crash, but others who did see it say it
ended before the dragging. The DMV states they were not shown the
dragging, and Cruise did not tell them about it, including in a letter
they sent shortly after the events. Cruise insists they did show the
full video to the DMV, and the DMV insists otherwise, but there is
little doubt that they were not open about what was obviously the most
important part of the chain of events when it came to understanding the
role of the robotaxi in the calamity. Cruise was very eager to show that
the initial crash was not their fault, but didn’t want to talk at all
about their own serious mistake.
</blockquote>
Laura Dobberstein reports on part of the aftermath in
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/14/gms_cruise_sacrifices_9_execs/"><i>GM’s
Cruise sheds nine execs in the name of safety and
integrity</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
GM’s self-driving taxi outfit, Cruise, has dismissed nine execs –
including its chief operating officer – after staff withheld information
regarding an incident in which a woman was injured by one of the firm’s
robotaxis.<br /> <br /> “Today, following an initial analysis of the
October 2 incident and Cruise’s response to it, nine individuals
departed Cruise. These include key leaders from Legal, Government
Affairs, and Commercial Operations, as well as Safety and Systems,” a
Cruise spokesperson told <i>The Register</i>.<br /> <br /> “As a
company, we are committed to full transparency and are focused on
rebuilding trust and operating with the highest standards when it comes
to safety, integrity, and accountability and believe that new leadership
is necessary to achieve these goals,” the spokesperson added.
</blockquote>
It isn’t just the executives who are feeling the pain, as Hayden Field
and Michael Wayland report in
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/gms-cruise-laying-off-900-or-24percent-of-its-workforce.html"><i>GM’s
Cruise laying off 900 employees, or 24% of its workforce: Read the memo
here</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Cruise on Thursday announced internally that it will lay off 900
employees, or 24% of its workforce, the company confirmed to CNBC.<br />
<br /> The layoffs, which primarily affected commercial operations and
related corporate functions, are the latest turmoil for the robotaxi
startup and come one day after Cruise
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/gms-cruise-dismisses-nine-key-leaders-amid-safety-probe.html">dismissed
nine “key leaders”</a> for the company’s response to an Oct. 2 accident
in which a pedestrian was dragged 20 feet by a Cruise self-driving car
after being struck by another vehicle.<br /> <br /> The company had
3,800 employees before Thursday’s cuts, which also follow a round of
contractor layoffs at Cruise last month.
</blockquote>
Templeton’s main argument is that Cruise mishandled the PR problem
resulting from their vehicle dragging an injured pedestrian. They
certainly did, in particular by apparently concealing information from
the Dept. of Motor Vehicles. But the PR problem they faced is generic to
autonomous vehicles. They are marketed as being safer than human drivers
and, statistically, this may even be true. Waymo certainly makes a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/human-drivers-crash-a-lot-more-than-waymos-software-data-shows/">plausible
claim</a>. But although “safer” implies it does not mean “safe”, so
serious crashes will inevitably occur.<br /> <br /> When they do the
company’s PR department is in a no-win situation. The reporters who call
asking for the company’s reaction know that the company has a vast
amount of detailed information about what happened, logs and video. But
the PR people don’t, and even if they did they don’t have the skills to
interpret it. Given the nature of the AI driving the vehicle, it will
take considerable time for the engineers to find the bug that was the
root cause.<br /> <br /> The honest thing for the PR people to say is
“we don’t have the details, we’ll get back to you when we do”. Reporters
are likely to hear this as buying time for a cover-up.<br /> <br /> The
wrong thing for them to do is to give the reporters what little they
know, and spin it in ways that minimize the company’s fault. Later, when
the full details emerge, they will have been shown to have been covering
up the worst. Next time, even if they are honest, they won’t be
believed.<br /> <br /> The PR problem is even worse because it is
fundamentally asymmetric. The marketing pitch is that, statistically,
autonomous vehicles cause less accidents than humans. But the public
will never know about accidents that would have happened were a human
driving, but were averted by the AI driver. They will know about
accidents that did happen because the AI driver did something that a
human would not have, as with the Uber and Cruise incidents. When set
against the expectation of airline-level safety, this is an insuperable
problem.<br /> <br /> In
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport"><i>Driverless
cars were the future but now the truth is out: they’re on the road to
nowhere</i></a>, Christian Wolmar who has a book about the autonomous
winter entitled
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Driverless-Cars-Road-Nowhere-Perspectives/dp/1913019217/"><i>Driverless
Cars: On a Road to Nowhere?</i></a> points out that Cruise isn’t the
first robotaxi company felled by an accident. That would be Uber:<br />
<blockquote>
Right from the start, the hype far outpaced the technological advances.
In 2010, at the Shanghai Expo, General Motors had produced a video
showing a driverless car taking a pregnant woman to hospital at
breakneck speed and, as the commentary assured the viewers, safely. It
was precisely the promise of greater safety, cutting the terrible
worldwide annual roads death toll of 1.25m, that the sponsors of
driverless vehicles dangled in front of the public.<br /> <br /> And
that is now proving their undoing. First to go was Uber after an
accident in which one of its self-driving cars killed Elaine Herzberg in
Phoenix, Arizona. The car was in autonomous mode, and its “operator” was
accused of watching a TV show, meaning they did not notice when the car
hit Herzberg, who had confused its computers by stepping on to the
highway pushing a bike carrying bags on its handlebars. Fatally, the
computer could not interpret this confusing array of objects.<br />
<br /> Until then, Uber’s business model had been predicated on the idea
that within a few years it would dispense with drivers and provide a
fleet of robotaxis. That plan died with Herzberg, and Uber soon pulled
out of all its driverless taxi trials.
</blockquote>
In her
<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/12/self-driving-cars-hit-the-wall.html"><i>review
of Wolmar’s book</i></a> Yves Smith makes two good points:<br />
<blockquote>
Wolmar describes how this Brave New World has stalled out. The big
reason is that the world is too complicated. or to put it in Taleb-like
terms, there are way too many tail events to get them into training sets
for AI in cars to learn about them. The other issue, which Wolmar does
not make explicit, is that the public does not appear willing to accept
the sort of slip-shod tech standards of buggy consumer software. The
airline industry, which is very heavy regulated, has an impeccable
safety record, and citizens appear to expect something closer to
that…particularly citizens who don’t own or have investments in
self-driving cars and never consented to their risks.
</blockquote>
It isn’t just Cruise that is figuring out that
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/robotaxi-economics.html"><i>Robotaxi
Economics</i></a> don’t work. Rita Liao’s
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/"><i>Facing
roadblocks, China’s robotaxi darlings apply the brakes</i></a> reports
that they don’t work in China either:<br />
<blockquote>
Despite years of hype and progress in self-driving technologies, the
widespread availability of robotaxis remains a distant reality. That’s
due to a confluence of challenges, including safety, regulations and
costs.<br /> <br /> The last factor, in particular, is what has pushed
China’s robotaxi pioneers toward more opportunistic endeavors. To become
profitable, robotaxis need to eventually remove human operators. Though
China recently
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/13/china-autonomous-vehicle-driving-regulation/">clarified
rules around the need for human supervision</a>, taxis without a driver
behind the wheel are allowed only in restricted areas at present. To
attract customers, robotaxi services offer deep discounts on their paid
rides.<br /> <br /> Once the subsidies are gone and initial user
curiosity wanes, who’s willing to pay the same amount as taxi fares for
a few fixed routes?<br /> <br /> Struggling to address that question,
China’s robotaxi startups have woken up to the money-burning reality of
their business.
</blockquote>
So they are pivoting to a
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/china-robotaxi-apply-the-brakes/">viable
product</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One logical path to monetize self-driving technology is to sell a less
robust version of the technology, namely, advanced driver assistance
systems (ADAS) that still require human intervention.<br /> <br />
Deeproute, which is backed by Alibaba, significantly scaled back its
robotaxi operations this year and plunged right into supplying ADAS to
automakers. Its production-ready solution, which includes its smart
driving software and lidar-powered hardware, is
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/05/autonomous-driving-darling-deeproute-ai-sets-sight-on-europe-carmakers/">sold
competitively at $2,000</a>. Similarly, Baidu is “downgrading the tech
stacks” to find paying customers on its way up what it calls the “Mount
Everest of self-driving.”<br /> <br /> “The experience and insight
gleaned from deploying our solutions in [mass-produced] vehicles is
being fed into our self-driving technology, giving us a unique moat
around security and data,” a Baidu spokesperson said.
</blockquote>
Not a good year for the robotaxi concept, the thing that was supposed to
distinguish Tesla’s cars from everyone else’s because they would earn
their owners money while they slept.<br />
<h3>
Tesla
</h3>
As usual, when it comes to self-driving Tesla’s story is worse than
almost everyone else’s. Elon Musk famously claimed that
<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-worth-zero-without-fsd-why-he-is-completely-wrong-191416.html">Tesla
is worth zero without Full Self Driving</a>. But although this is
typical Musk BS, but unlike some other utterances it contains a kernel
of truth. Tesla is valued as a <i>technology</i> company not a
<i>car</i> company. Thus it is critical for Telsa that its technology be
viewed as better than those of other car companies; anything that
suggests it is limited or inadequate is a big problem not just for the
company but also for Musk’s personal wealth.<br /> <br /> I believe this
is why Tesla hasn’t implemented effective driver monitoring nor
geo-fenced their systems. And why members of the Musk cult are so keen
on defeating the driver monitoring system with weights on the steering
wheel and smiley-face stickers on the camera. Depending upon what you
believe, the technology is either groundbreaking autonomy or a below
average Level-2 driver assistance system (Mercedes has fielded a
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/mercedes-benzs-level-3-autonomous-driving-system-takes-over-in-heavy-traffic/">Level
3 system</a>). The congnitive dissonance between the pronouncements of
the cult leader and the reality of continually being “nagged” about the
limits of the technology is too hard for the cult members to take.<br />
<br /> The <i>Washington Post</i> team of Trisha Thadani, Rachel Lerman,
Imogen Piper, Faiz Siddiqui and Irfan Uraizee has been delivering
outstanding reporting on Tesla’s technology. They started on Octoober
6<sup>th</sup> with
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/"><i>The
final 11 seconds of a fatal Tesla Autopilot crash</i></a>, in which a
Tesla driver enabled Autopilot in conditions for which it was not
designed, and set the speed to 14mph above the limit. Then on December
10<sup>th</sup> they followed with
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/"><i>Tesla
drivers run Autopilot where it’s not intended — with deadly
consequences</i></a> and
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-cross-traffic/"><i>Why
Tesla Autopilot shouldn’t be used in as many places as you
think</i></a>.<br /> <br /> They recount a 2019
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">crash
in Florida</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A Tesla driving on Autopilot crashed through a T intersection at about
70 mph and flung the young couple into the air, killing Benavides Leon
and gravely injuring Angulo. In police body-camera footage obtained by
The Washington Post, the shaken driver says he was “driving on cruise”
and took his eyes off the road when he dropped his phone.<br /> <br />
But the 2019 crash reveals a problem deeper than driver inattention. It
occurred on a rural road where Tesla’s Autopilot technology was
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-cross-traffic/">not
designed to be used</a>. Dash-cam footage captured by the Tesla and
obtained exclusively by The Post shows the car blowing through a stop
sign, a blinking light and five yellow signs warning that the road ends
and drivers must turn left or right.
</blockquote>
Note that, just like the repeated
<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/us-opens-formal-probe-tesla-autopilot_n_611a651de4b0f7bc26a7eef4">crashes
into emergency vehicles</a>, the victims did not volunteer to debug
Tesla’s software. And also that the Autopilot system was driving 15mph
above the speed limit on a road it wasn’t designed for, just like the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">2019
Banner crash</a> into a semi-trailer. As I wrote about
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/10/elon-musk-threat-or-menace-part-3.html">that
crash</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It is typical of Tesla’s disdain for the law that, although their cars
have GPS and can therefore know the speed limit, they didn’t bother to
program Autopilot to obey the law.<br /> …<br /> Again, Tesla’s disdain
for the safety of their customers, not to mention other road users,
meant that despite the car knowing which road it was on and thus whether
it was a road that Autopilot should not be activated on, it allowed
Banner to enable it.
</blockquote>
Federal regulators have known there was a problem for more than seven
years, but they
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">haven’t
taken effective action</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Nor have federal regulators taken action. After the 2016 crash, which
killed Tesla driver Joshua Brown, the National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB) called for limits on where driver-assistance technology
could be activated. But as a purely investigative agency, the NTSB has
no regulatory power over Tesla. Its peer agency, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which is part of the Department
of Transportation, has the authority to establish enforceable auto
safety standards — but its failure to act has given rise to an unusual
and increasingly tense rift between the two agencies.
</blockquote>
The reason may be that car manufacturers “self-certify”
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/10/tesla-autopilot-crash/">conformance
with safety standards</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2023/tesla-autopilot-crash-analysis/">string
of Autopilot crashes</a> reveals the consequences of allowing a rapidly
evolving technology to operate on the nation’s roadways without
significant government oversight, experts say. While NHTSA has several
ongoing investigations into the company and specific crashes, critics
argue the agency’s approach is too reactive and has allowed a flawed
technology to put Tesla drivers — and those around them — at risk.<br />
<br /> The approach contrasts with federal regulation of planes and
railroads, where crashes involving new technology or equipment — such as
recurring issues with Boeing’s 737 Max — have resulted in sweeping
action by agencies or Congress to ground planes or mandate new safety
systems. Unlike planes, which are certified for airworthiness through a
process called “type certification,” passenger car models are not
prescreened, but are subject to a set of regulations called Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, which manufacturers face the burden to
meet.
</blockquote>
And Tesla’s self-certification is self-serving.<br /> <br />
Self-certification would work well if the penalty for false
certification was severe, but the NTHSA has declined to impose
<i>any</i> penalty for Tesla’s manifestly inadequate system. It seems
that the team’s reporting finally drove the NHTSA to do <i>something</i>
about the long-standing problems of Autopilot. Reuters reported that
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/13/tesla-recall-us-autopilot"><i>Tesla
recalls more than 2m vehicles in US over Autopilot system</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla is recalling just over 2m vehicles in the United States fitted
with its Autopilot advanced driver-assistance system to install new
safeguards, after a safety regulator said the system was open to
“foreseeable misuse”.<br /> <br /> The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA) has been investigating the electric automaker led
by the billionaire Elon Musk for more than two years over whether Tesla
vehicles adequately ensure that drivers pay attention when using the
driver assistance system.<br /> <br /> Tesla said in the recall filing
that Autopilot’s software system controls “may not be sufficient to
prevent driver misuse” and could increase the risk of a crash.<br />
…<br /> Separately, since 2016, NHTSA has opened more than three dozen
Tesla special crash investigations in cases where driver systems such as
Autopilot were suspected of being used, with 23 crash deaths reported to
date.<br /> <br /> NHTSA said there might be an increased risk of a
crash in situations when the system is engaged but the driver does not
maintain responsibility for vehicle operation and is unprepared to
intervene or fails to recognize when it is canceled or not.
</blockquote>
The obfuscation is extraordinary — “forseeable misuse”, “may not be
sufficient” and “could increase”. There is no “foreseeable”, “may” nor
“could”; multiple people have already <i>died</i> because the system
<i>was</i> abused. When Tesla is sued about these deaths, their
<i>defense is that the system was abused</i>! I believe the system is
specifically <i>designed</i> to allow abuse, because preventing abuse
would puncture the hype bubble.<br /> <br /> Fortunately from the
NTHSA’s point of view the recall is pure kabuki, posing no risk from
Musk’s attack-dog lawyers and
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/buttigieg-defends-safety-agency-appointment-after-musk-claims-bias/">cult</a>
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/tesla-missy-cummings-nhtsa-elon-musk.html">members</a>
because the over-the-air update is cheap and doesn’t actually fix the
problem. The <i>Washington Post</i>’s headline writers didn’t understand
this whan they captioned the team’s timeline
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall-timeline/"><i>How
Tesla Autopilot got grounded</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Now, more than 2 million Tesla vehicles are
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/">receiving
a software update</a> to address “insufficient” controls to combat
driver inattention while in Autopilot mode. Here’s how the recall
unfolded, according to documents from Tesla, safety officials and
reporting by The Washington Post.
</blockquote>
The team did understand that Autopilot hadn’t been “grounded”. In
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/16/tesla-autopilot-recall/"><i>Recalling
almost every Tesla in America won’t fix safety issues, experts
say</i></a> they lay it out:<br />
<blockquote>
Tesla this week agreed to issue a remote update to 2 million cars aimed
at improving driver attention while Autopilot is engaged, especially on
surface roads with cross traffic and other hazards the driver-assistance
technology is not designed to detect.<br /> <br /> But the recall — the
largest in Tesla’s 20-year history — quickly drew condemnation from
experts and lawmakers, who said new warnings and alerts are unlikely to
solve Autopilot’s fundamental flaw: that Tesla fails to limit where
drivers can turn it on in the first place.<br /> …<br /> Tesla has
repeatedly acknowledged in user manuals, legal documents and
communications with federal regulators that Autosteer is “intended for
use on controlled-access highways” with “a center divider, clear lane
markings, and no cross traffic.”
</blockquote>
The <i>Washington Post</i>’s Geoffrey A. Fowler checked on the result of
the kabuki, and wrote
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/31/tesla-autopilot-recall-test/"><i>Testing
Tesla’s Autopilot recall, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should
you</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Last weekend, my Tesla Model Y received an over-the-air update to make
its driver-assistance software safer. In my first test drive of the
updated Tesla, it blew through two stop signs without even slowing
down.<br /> <br /> In December, Tesla issued its largest-ever recall,
affecting almost all of its 2 million cars. It is like the software
updates you get on your phone, except this was supposed to prevent
drivers from misusing Tesla’s Autopilot software.<br /> <br /> After
testing my Tesla update, I don’t feel much safer — and neither should
you, knowing that this technology is on the same roads you use.<br />
<br /> During my drive, the updated Tesla steered itself on urban San
Francisco streets Autopilot wasn’t designed for. (I was careful to let
the tech do its thing only when my hands were hovering by the wheel and
I was paying attention.) The recall was supposed to force drivers to pay
more attention while using Autopilot by sensing hands on the steering
wheel and checking for eyes on the road. Yet my car drove through the
city with my hands off the wheel for stretches of a minute or more. I
could even activate Autopilot after I placed a sticker over the car’s
interior camera used to track my attention.
</blockquote>
Fowler concludes “I found we have every reason to be skeptical this
recall does much of anything”. Good job, Tesla!<br /> <br /> As a final
note Rishi Sunak, the UK’s tech-bro Prime Minister is naturally
determined to make the UK a leader in autonomous vehicles with his new
legislation on the subject. But, being a tech-bro, he has no idea of the
fundamental problem they pose. Wolmar does understand it,
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/06/driverless-cars-future-vehicles-public-transport">writing</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
In the UK, Tesla will fall foul of the legislation introduced into
parliament last month, which prevents companies from misleading the
public about the capability of their vehicles. Tesla’s troubles have
been compounded by the revelations from ex-employee Lukasz Krupski who
claims the self-drive capabilities of Teslas
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67591311">pose a risk to
the public</a>. Manufacturers will be forced to specify precisely which
functions of the car – steering, brakes, acceleration – have been
automated. Tesla will have to change its marketing approach in order to
comply. So, while the bill has been promoted as enabling the more rapid
introduction of driverless cars, meeting its restrictive terms may prove
to be an insuperable obstacle for their developers.
</blockquote>
<p>Tesla’s stock market valuation <i>depends</i> upon “misleading the
public about the capability of their vehicles”.<br /> <br /></p>

Consumer credit jumped a whopping $23.7 billion in November, according
to the Federal Reserve. That continues a trend of households struggling
with high and rising prices, which is leading to a surge in debt and
delinquencies. And it’s putting additional strain on families,
especially lower-income ones. We’ll also preview what the December CPI

I first heard this term in speeches given by a tech exec,

talking about a competitor’s product. A hairball is something a cat
coughs up. Very undesirable. Of course, given enough time all software
becomes a hairball. As you refine your understanding of how the product
is being used, versus how you thought it would be used, all the new
paths through the code and UI become more crooked and impenetrable by a
human mind, because you still have to do all the things you did before,
unless you start over. There often is value in starting over. Now is a
good time to be thinking about bare-bones social web apps. People are
open to new ideas. I miss the role Twitter used to play, I imagine other
people do too.</p>

people aren’t making a distinction between the expression and the

Yesterday the administration announced 67 new recipients of nearly $1
billion in grant funding to transition to low- and zero-emission school
buses. The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Clean School Bus
Program, which gets funding from Biden’s 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, has $5 billion to spend over five years on helping schools swap old
buses for cleaner ones. So far it has allocated about $2 billion across
652 school districts, and this new round of funding will buy more than
2,700 clean buses. Most of the grant recipients are located in
low-income, rural, and tribal communities,

published in the journal <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of

insured. The tally includes the devastating earthquake in Turkey and
Syria, but the analysis also points to climate change as a main driver
of severe storms that plagued North America and Europe, resulting in
unprecedented losses. “The warming of the Earth that has been
accelerating for some years is intensifying the extreme weather in many
regions, leading to increasing loss potentials,” says Munich Re’s chief
climate scientist Ernst Rauch. He added: “Society and industry need to
adapt to the changing risks – otherwise loss burdens will inevitably
increase.” There’s a map that shows the most expensive natural
disasters. It is too big to feature in one go, so here it is split in

latest accident might not ground business</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Investigators are still looking into why a piece of a Boeing aircraft
blew off an Alaska Airlines flight over the weekend. It’s the latest
issue with 737 Max planes, including an aircraft grounding following two
crashes several years ago. Thing is, plane orders take years and there
are few manufacturing competitors — meaning Boeing may not lose much
businesses. And later: how Germany’s budget cuts helped spawn a major
protest by farmers.

id="video-of-73-year-old-boarded-up-inside-apartment-sparks-investigation">Video
of 73-Year-Old Boarded Up Inside Apartment Sparks Investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HARVEY, Ill. — Rudolph Williams says he was home in a Chicago suburb
when he realized the doors and windows to his courtyard-style apartment
had been boarded up with plywood, locking him inside.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know exactly what was going on,” the 73-year-old said
Monday in describing how he tried to open his blocked door. “What the
hell?”</p>
<p>His story — chronicled by his nephew on now-viral videos — has
generated a firestorm of criticism about rental conditions at the
dilapidated low-income apartment complex in Harvey, Illinois. People are
also debating who’s to blame; and Mayor Christopher Clark has promised
an investigation.</p>
<p>City officials, residents, property owners and the property
management company have conflicting accounts about what happened Friday
at the 30-unit complex roughly 48.28 kilometers 30 miles) south of
Chicago.</p>
<p>It started that afternoon when crews without any logos on their
clothing or vehicles started boarding up units. Residents say they
weren’t warned and that the workers ignored residents telling them
people were still inside. City officials say police were on site earlier
in the day and performed well-being checks, but not when units were set
to be boarded up. The property owners say the tenants claims about
residents being boarded inside are false, and the property managers say
the units were empty before they started boarding up units at the city’s
direction.</p>
<p>No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Genevieve Tyler, who said she was recently laid off from her meat
factory job, was home when she heard noises outside and ran for a second
door in her apartment looking to escape because she thought it was a
break-in. That’s when she said she came upon crews boarding up her
windows.</p>
<p>“I feel sick,” she said, adding that she was too scared to return
home for two days. “I’m still sad.”</p>
<p>The complex, which is in clear disrepair, has been on the city’s
radar for months.</p>
<p>One of the two buildings has no heat, with residents using stoves and
space heaters to keep warm. A set of stairs has collapsed and is blocked
to pedestrians. There is garbage everywhere: broken furniture, a large
dumbbell and liquor bottles.</p>
<p>There have also been numerous safety issues involving drugs and
crime. Police were called to the property more than 300 times last year,
according to Harvey Police Chief Cameron Biddings.</p>
<p>City officials say the property owners, identified by the city as Jay
Patel and Henry Cho, were warned about the unsafe conditions and urged
to make changes. The owners were then notified that people had to
evacuate by Oct. 28 and had to let residents know.</p>
<p>However, only some residents say they got the message. Others who
were notified say they were skeptical of the documents’ legitimacy. Some
got letters on official city letterhead saying they had to leave due to
the safety risk, while others received papers from the property managers
that said the building would be shut down.</p>
<p>James Williams, Rudolph’s nephew, who lives with him at the property,
said a bunch of notices were strewn around the courtyard.</p>
<p>He and other people on site helped free his uncle from the apartment
Friday evening, partly by using a drill, he said.</p>
<p>In a joint statement emailed late Monday, the property owners
dismissed the residents’ “viral allegations.” The owners said they tried
to negotiate more time with the city for renters to stay and aimed to
have required repairs finished by March for the building to reopen.</p>
<p>The owners hired property management company, Chicago Style
Management, in November.</p>
<p>Tim Harstead with Chicago Style Management disputed Williams’
account, saying crews found one unauthorized person who left before they
started boarding up units.</p>
<p>“A lot of people in that area are squatters and trying to stay
there,” he said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mayor Clark and other city officials toured the complex,
which lies off a busy street in the community of 20,000.</p>
<p>In a series of interviews, Clark reluctantly acknowledged that people
were still inside their units when the apartments started being
shuttered, but he said he wanted to hear directly from residents rather
than via social media videos.</p>
<p>The city played no role in boarding up the apartments, he said,
pledging that city police would investigate and might turn the matter
over to the state’s attorney or Illinois attorney general. Criticism of
the city on social media was misdirected, he said.</p>
<p>“It’s horrible,” Clark said. “What’s even more horrible is the fact
that they would attribute that to people who are trying to actually help
the situation versus the people who actually put them in this
situation.”</p>
<p>At least one city official, Alderman Tyrone Rogers, told media
outlets over the weekend that residents’ claims were a “total
exaggeration.” He did not return messages Monday from The Associated
Press.</p>
<p>Some residents, including 34-year-old Loren Johnson, left last month.
He said the shutdown notice scared him off as did the broken heating and
criminal activity.</p>
<p>“They don’t do anything, but they take full rent,” he said of the
landlords.</p>
<p>Roughly half a dozen residents remained on Monday, saying they look
out for each other.</p>
<p>Mary Brooks, 66, lives in one of the few apartments that wasn’t
boarded up.</p>
<p>She described herself as a cancer survivor with mental health issues
who has nowhere else to go. She also said she has tried to reach city
officials multiple times about the complex over her nearly four years of
living there, a complaint she shared with the mayor when he visited her
at home Monday.</p>
<p>“Nobody pays attention to the poor,” she said. “Nobody cares until
something happens.”</p>

<h2 id="us-man-held-in-moscow-on-drug-charges">US Man Held in Moscow on
Drug Charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — Russia has detained and brought drug-related charges against
U.S. citizen Robert Woodland, who was apprehended by law enforcement
earlier this month, a Moscow court said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Moscow is holding several American nationals on espionage and other
charges, as tensions between Russia and the United States balloon over
the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“On January 6, the Ostankinsky District Court of Moscow ordered
Robert Romanov Woodland to be placed in detention for a period of two
months, until March 5, 2024,” the court said on social media.</p>
<p>He is accused of the “illegal acquisition, storage, transportation,
manufacture, processing” of drugs and faces up to 20 years in
prison.</p>
<p>Russian authorities have arrested several U.S. citizens in recent
years, with critics accusing Moscow of using detainees as bargaining
chips to exchange Russians jailed in the United States.</p>
<p>Paul Whelan, an ex-US marine was sentenced in 2020 to 16 years in
jail on spying charges that he denies.</p>
<p>In late March 2023, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich

Urges Israel to Avoid Further Harming Civilians in Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv Tuesday to ensure his
country’s military avoids inflicting further harm on civilians in Gaza
in its ongoing war against Hamas militants.</p>
<p>“The Secretary reaffirmed our support for Israel’s right to prevent
the terrorist attacks of October 7 from being repeated and stressed the
importance of avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian
infrastructure in Gaza,” State Department spokesman Mathew Miller said
in a statement Tuesday after Blinken met with Netanyahu and Israel’s war
cabinet.</p>
<p>Earlier, speaking alongside Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Blinken
said he would have the opportunity to meet with the families of the some
of the hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza, and to relay to Israeli
leaders some of what he heard from other leaders in the region during
stops in Turkey, Greece, Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and
Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Herzog thanked the United States for “standing steadfast with Israel”
and said the war against Hamas is one that “affects international values
and the values of the free world.”</p>
<p>Herzog also rejected a lawsuit filed at the International Court of
Justice accusing Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,
calling the accusation “atrocious and preposterous.”</p>
<p>Hearings in the case are due to begin Thursday, and Herzog said
Israel will “present proudly our case of using self-defense under our
most inherent right under international humanitarian law.”</p>
<p>Gaza health officials say close to 23,000 Palestinians, a large
percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel’s
military offensive in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>Israel has criticized Hamas for locating its operations in civilian
areas, including the use of tunnels under cities.  Herzog said Tuesday
that Israel is “doing our utmost under extremely complicated
circumstances” to ensure there are no civilian casualties.</p>
<p>Blinken said Monday that leaders in the Middle East are determined to
prevent the Gaza conflict from spreading and that there is broad
recognition on the need to “chart a political path forward for the
Palestinians.”</p>
<p>“The West Bank and Gaza should be united under Palestinian-led
governance,” Blinken told reporters in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>“The future of the region needs to be one of integration, not
division and not conflict,” Blinken said, adding “for that to happen, we
need to see the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.”</p>
<p>In a statement following talks with Blinken, Saudi Arabian Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman underscored the importance of halting
military operations in the Gaza Strip and the need to create conditions
for restoring peace and stability.</p>
<p>When asked about the U.S.-led talks to normalize the relationship
between Saudi Arabia and Israel, Blinken said there is “a clear
interest” in Saudi Arabia, as well as in the region, in pursuing that
goal but “it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will
also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian
state.”</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has paused diplomatic talks to normalize ties with
Israel amid the military conflict between Hamas militants and Israeli
forces.</p>
<p>After an Israeli airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander in
southern Lebanon on Monday — the latest sign of a possibly widening
conflict in the Middle East — Blinken told reporters it is clearly not
in the interest of Israel, Lebanon, or Hezbollah to see an escalation
outside Gaza and “the Israelis have been very clear with” the U.S. that
“they want to find a diplomatic way forward.”</p>
<p>Hezbollah has identified the commander as Wissam al-Tawil. Last week,
senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike in
Beirut. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant
allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range
attacks against Israel.</p>
<p>The United States has urged Israel to shift to smaller scale military
operations in Gaza but has continued to support Israel in refusing Arab
demands for a cease-fire to halt the fighting in the three-month war.
Israel has vowed to continue the war until it believes the threat of
future Hamas attacks has been eradicated and the militant group no
longer controls Gaza, a narrow strip of territory along the
Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas
fighters crossed into southern Israel on October 7. Israel said about
1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror
attack.</p>
<p>Some material for this report was provided by Reuters and The
Associated Press.</p>

Narrowly Avoided Disaster as Jet’s Wall Rips Away at 3 Miles High</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — The loud “boom” was startling enough, and the
roaring wind that immediately filled the airline cabin left Kelly
Bartlett unnerved. Still, it wasn’t until a shaken teenager, shirtless
and scratched, slid into the seat next to her that she realized just how
close disaster had come.</p>
<p>A section of the Boeing 737 Max 9’s fuselage just three rows away had
blown out — at 4.8 kilometers (3 miles ) high — creating a vacuum that
twisted the metal of the seats nearby, and snatched cellphones, headsets
and even the shirt off the teenager’s back.</p>
<p>“We knew something was wrong,” Bartlett told The Associated Press on
Monday. “We didn’t know what. We didn’t know how serious. We didn’t know
if it meant we were going to crash.”</p>
<p>The first six minutes of Alaska Airlines flight 1282 from Portland to
Southern California’s Ontario International Airport on Friday had been
routine, the Boeing 737 Max 9 about halfway to its cruising altitude and
traveling at more than 640 kph (400 mph).</p>
<p>Flight attendants had just told the 171 passengers that they could
resume using electronic devices — in airplane mode, of course — when it
happened.</p>
<p>Then suddenly a 61-centimeter-by-122-centimeter (2-foot-by-4-foot)
piece of fuselage covering an unoperational emergency exit behind the
left wing blew out. Only seven seats on the flight were unoccupied, and
as fate would have it, these included the two seats closest to the
blown-out hole.</p>
<p>The oxygen masks dropped immediately, and Bartlett saw a flight
attendant walking down the aisle toward the affected row, leaning
forward as if facing a stiff wind. Then flight attendants began moving
passengers from the area where the blowout occurred and helped them move
away.</p>
<p>Among them was the teenage boy moved next to Bartlett.</p>
<p>“His shirt got sucked off of his body when the panel blew out because
of the pressure, and it was his seatbelt that kept him in his seat and
saved his life. And there he was next to me,” she said, adding that his
mother was reseated elsewhere.</p>
<p>“We had our masks on, and the plane was really loud so we couldn’t
talk. But I had a … notes app on my phone that I was typing on. So I
typed to him and I asked him if he was hurt,” Bartlett said. “I just
couldn’t believe he was sitting there and what he must have gone
through, what he must have been feeling at the time.”</p>
<p>She said the boy typed back that he was OK, but a bit scratched,
adding “that was unbelievable” and “thank you for your kindness.”</p>
<p>The exit door plug landed in the southwest Portland backyard of high
school physics teacher Bob Sauer. Sauer said his heart “did start
beating a little faster” when he saw it in the beam of his flashlight
Sunday night as he searched for any debris.</p>
<p>“It was very obviously part of a plane,” he told a group of reporters
outside his home on Monday. “I thought, ‘Oh my goodness, people have
been looking for this all weekend and it looks like it’s in my
backyard.’”</p>
<p>Sauer said he and the seven National Transportation Safety Board
agents who came to his home to pick up the door plug were amazed it was
intact. It appeared that tree branches had broken its fall.</p>
<p>A headrest landed on the patio of Sauer’s neighbor, Diane Flaherty.
Flaherty didn’t realize what the charcoal-colored cushion was until a
friend emailed her to say federal agents were looking for airplane parts
in her neighborhood. An NTSB agent came by to pick it up.</p>
<p>“What are the chances that a headrest cushion falls out of the sky
into your backyard?” she said.</p>
<p>The pilots and flight attendants have not made public statements and
their names have not been released, but in interviews with National
Transportation Safety Board investigators they described how their
training kicked in. The pilots focused on getting the plane quickly back
to Portland and the flight attendants on keeping the passengers safe and
as calm as possible.</p>
<p>“The actions of the flight crew were really incredible,” NTSB Chair
Jennifer Homendy said at a Sunday night news conference. She described
the scene inside the cabin during those first seconds as “chaos, very
loud between the air and everything going on around them and it was very
violent.”</p>
<p>Bartlett echoed praise for the crew, saying the entire time she felt
like the plane was under control even though the roaring wind was so
loud she couldn’t hear the captain’s announcements.</p>
<p>“The flight attendants really responded well to the situation. They
got everyone safe and then they got themselves safe,” she said. “And
then there was nothing to do but wait, right? We were just on our way
down and it was just a normal descent. It felt normal.”</p>
<p>Inside the cockpit, the pilot and co-pilot donned their oxygen masks
and opened their microphone, but “communication was a serious issue”
between them and the flight attendants because of the noise, Homendy
said. The pilots retrieved an emergency handbook kept secure next to the
captain’s seat.</p>
<p>The co-pilot contacted air traffic controllers, declaring an
emergency and saying the plane needed to immediately descend to 3,048
meters, (10,000 feet) the altitude where there is enough oxygen for
everyone onboard to breathe.</p>
<p>“We need to turn back to Portland,” she said in a calm voice that she
maintained throughout the landing.</p>
<p>In the cabin, the flight attendants’ immediate focus was on the five
unaccompanied minors in their care and the three infants being carried
on their parents’ laps.</p>
<p>“Were they safe? Were they secure? Did they have their seat belts on
or their lap belts on? And did they have their masks on? And they did,”
Homendy said.</p>
<p>Some passengers began sending messages on social media to loved ones.
One young woman said on TikTok that she was certain the plane would
nosedive at any second and she wondered how her death would affect her
mother, worrying that she would never recover from the sorrow.</p>
<p>But she and others said the cabin remained surprisingly calm. One
passenger, Evan Granger, who was sitting in front of the blowout, told
NBC News that his “focus in that moment was just breathe into the oxygen
mask and trust that the flight crew will do everything they can to keep
us safe.”</p>
<p>“There were so many things that had to go right in order for all of
us to survive,” Granger said.</p>
<p>Video taken by those on board showed flight attendants moving down
the aisle checking on passengers. Through the hole, city lights could be
seen flickering past.</p>
<p>Evan Smith, an attorney traveling on the plane, told reporters the
descent and landing were loud but smooth. When the plane touched down at
Portland International about 20 minutes after it departed, the
passengers broke into applause. Firefighters came down the aisle to
check for injuries, but no one was seriously hurt.</p>
<p>Homendy said that if the blowout had happened a few minutes later,
after the plane reached cruising altitude, the accident might have
become a tragedy.</p>
<p>Bartlett’s mind also keeps returning to the what-ifs.</p>
<p>“I’m glad that it is not any worse than it was — that’s all. I keep
coming back to it,” she said. “Like, how lucky Jack got. That was his
name, the kid who sat next to me. His name was Jack, and how lucky he
was that he had a seatbelt on.”</p>
<p>On Sunday, a passenger’s cellphone that had been sucked out of the
plane was found. It was still operational, having survived its plunge
from the sky.</p>
<p>It was open to the owner’s baggage claim receipt.</p>

id="biden-describes-white-supremacy-as-poison-in-pitch-to-black-voters">Biden
Describes White Supremacy as ‘Poison’ in Pitch to Black Voters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden made a heartfelt appeal to Black
voters on Monday, speaking passionately at a storied South Carolina
church scarred by racially motivated tragedy and seeking support as
members of the state’s large Black community head to the nation’s first
Democratic primary next month.</p>
<p>Before a packed congregation at Charleston’s Mother Emanuel African
Methodist Episcopal Church, Biden spoke of “a poison that’s for too long
haunted this nation,” echoing words from former President Donald Trump,
who has made waves on the campaign trail by accusing immigrants of
“poisoning the blood” of the nation.</p>
<p>“What is that poison?” Biden continued. “White supremacy. …
Throughout our history, it’s ripped this nation apart. This has no place
in America. Not today, tomorrow or ever.”</p>
<p>With those words, Biden became the first sitting American president
to speak from the pulpit of one of the nation’s oldest and most
respected Black spiritual institutions. The stately church, founded more
than two centuries ago, was the scene of a gruesome mass shooting in
2015 in which nine people, including the church’s pastor, were killed by
a white supremacist.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama delivered the eulogy at the Reverend Clementa
Pinckney’s funeral in 2015, which was held in TD Arena at the College of
Charleston.</p>
<p>The tragedy prompted South Carolina’s governor at the time, Nikki
Haley — who is now running for the Republican presidential nomination —
to remove the Confederate flag that flew over the state Capitol.</p>
<p>Biden also capitalized on the venue by indirectly mentioning Haley’s
reluctance in a recent public forum to acknowledge that disagreements
over slavery caused the Civil War.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear for those who don’t seem to know: Slavery was the
cause of the Civil War,” he said, to applause. “There is no negotiation
about that.”</p>
<p>Racism an election issue</p>
<p>Groups that work to mobilize overlooked voters say racism is a top
issue that emerges time and again in polls and focus groups.</p>
<p>Cynthia Wallace co-founded the New Rural Project after her
unsuccessful congressional run in 2020 showed that 60,000 registered
voters of color in her North Carolina district didn’t turn up at the
polls.</p>
<p>“When we look at the top issues that concern folks, and we look at it
by demographics, African American infrequent voters — these are part of
those 60,000 folks who didn’t show up, who we are actually specifically
targeted to speak to — one of their top issues, whether it’s from the
polling or the focus groups, is racism,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>But, she added, “We continue to hear most of the rural folks that we
speak to focus on the kitchen-table issues.”</p>
<p>South Carolina Representative Jim Clyburn hit some of those points in
introducing Biden, listing what he saw as Biden’s achievements and
contrasting him with Trump.</p>
<p>Clyburn outlined Biden’s attempts at student loan forgiveness, his
appointment of an unprecedented number of Black female judges, his
support of abortion rights, his work to reduce health care costs and his
efforts to help veterans.</p>
<p>“We know Joe,” he said. “But most importantly, Joe knows us
well.”</p>
<p>“I rest my case,” Biden quipped after Clyburn’s speech, as attendees
chanted “Four more years!” in support of Biden’s reelection.</p>
<p>But Clyburn’s rousing words contrasted with his weekend comments on
CNN, where he said he was “very concerned” about the Biden campaign’s
ability to “break through that MAGA wall” — a reference to Trump’s Make
America Great Again motto — and communicate his message to voters.</p>
<p>Polls show that Biden faces challenges with Black voters, who
propelled him to victory over Trump in 2020. A poll conducted late last
year by the GenForward Survey project found that 17% of Black voters
said they would vote for Trump, and 20% would vote for “someone else.”
Sixty-three percent said they would vote for Biden.</p>
<p>‘Cease-fire now’ or ‘four more years’?</p>
<p>Some of the disagreements appeared in real-time on Monday, when a
heckler, referring to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, led a chant of
“cease-fire now” — which was then drowned out by louder chants of “four
more years.”</p>
<p>Biden acknowledged the hecklers, saying, “I understand their
passion.”</p>
<p>He added, “I’ve been quietly working with the Israeli government to
get them to reduce and significantly get out of Gaza. I’ve been using
all that I can to do that.”</p>
<p>Democratic strategist Douglas Wilson, speaking to VOA from North
Carolina, said the Black community is divided on perceptions of the war
in Gaza, with younger voters viewing “Palestinians as being people of
color and look at the end of the Israelis as occupiers or as
colonizers.”</p>
<p>“That’s a course that’s up for debate,” he added. “I don’t agree with
that personally. But there is a segment of the community that feels that
way.”</p>
<p>Misinformation and the economy</p>
<p>Wallace, of the New Rural Project, noted the role of misinformation
in skewing attitudes. She said that only one Black voter she spoke to
raised the issue of Gaza and falsely claimed that Biden supports Hamas,
the militant group that launched the stunning attack on Israel on
Oct. 7.</p>
<p>Biden has repeatedly called Hamas “terrorists,” described their acts
as “evil” and has given material and moral support to Israel. Hamas is a
U.S.-designated terrorist group.</p>
<p>“I think in this information-heavy world, I think it’s hard for
information to cut through,” Wallace said. “You’ve got to make sure that
people actually know what things you’ve done and what things you plan to
do more of and what things you’re fighting for.”</p>
<p>Wilson added that more details on Black economic empowerment could
also shift voter support.</p>
<p>“I would have liked to hear him give a brief outline of what his
economic agenda will be in a second term for Black America,” he said.
“And I think that if he can begin to articulate that, then it will give
Black voters a reason to come out and vote for him in high numbers.”</p>
<p>South Carolina voters participate in the Democratic presidential
primary on Feb. 3, in which Representative Dean Phillips and author and
self-professed spiritual adviser Marianne Williamson are also on the
ballot.</p>

id="blinken-middle-east-leaders-determined-to-prevent-wider-war">Blinken:
Middle East Leaders Determined to Prevent Wider War</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday
leaders in the Middle East are determined to prevent the Gaza conflict
from spreading and that there is broad recognition on the need to “chart
a political path forward for the Palestinians.” </p>
<p>“The West Bank and Gaza should be united under Palestinian-led
governance,” Blinken told reporters at Al Ula airport in Saudi
Arabia. </p>
<p>“The future of the region needs to be one of integration, not
division and not conflict,” said Blinken, adding “for that to happen, we
need to see the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.” </p>
<p>In a statement following talks with Blinken, Saudi Arabian Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman underscored the importance of halting
military operations in the Gaza Strip and the need to create conditions
for restoring peace and stability. Local media have reported that this
effort aims to ensure the Palestinian people obtain their legitimate
rights and achieve a just and lasting peace. </p>
<p>On Monday, Blinken met with the United Arab Emirates President Sheikh
Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and senior officials from Saudi Arabia
before heading to Israel. </p>
<p>The chief U.S. diplomat said he would push Israeli officials for more
humanitarian aid to Gaza and more protection for civilians. He also
plans to discuss efforts to secure the release of the remaining hostages
and how to ensure the conflict does not spread to other parts of the
region.   </p>
<p>When asked about the U.S.-led talks to normalize the relationship
between Saudi Arabia and Israel, Blinken stated that there is “a clear
interest” in Saudi Arabia, as well as in the region, in pursuing that
goal but “it will require that the conflict end in Gaza, and it will
also clearly require that there be a practical pathway to a Palestinian
state.” </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has paused diplomatic talks to normalize ties with
Israel amid the military conflict between Hamas militants and Israeli
forces. </p>
<p>After an Israeli airstrike killed a key Hezbollah commander in
southern Lebanon on Monday — the latest sign of a possibly widening
conflict in the Middle East — Blinken told reporters it’s clearly not in
the interest of Israel, Lebanon, or Hezbollah to see an escalation
outside Gaza and “the Israelis have been very clear with” the U.S. that
“they want to find a diplomatic way forward.” </p>
<p>Hezbollah has identified the commander as Wissam al-Tawil. Last week,
senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike in
Beirut. Both Hamas and Hezbollah are backed by Iran, whose militant
allies in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have also been carrying out longer-range
attacks against Israel. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In meetings Sunday with Jordan King Abdullah II and Qatari Emir
Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the top U.S. diplomat spoke of the need
for Israel to curb civilian casualties during the Israeli-Hamas war in
Gaza and significantly increase the amount of humanitarian aid reaching
famished Palestinians in Gaza. </p>
<p>But the U.S. has continued to support Israel in refusing Arab demands
for a cease-fire to halt the fighting in the three-month war. Israel has
vowed to continue the war until it believes the threat of future Hamas
attacks has been eradicated and the militant group no longer controls
Gaza, a narrow strip of territory along the Mediterranean Sea. </p>
<p>Jordan’s royal court said King Abdullah “warned of the catastrophic
repercussions” of Israel’s war in Gaza against Hamas while calling on
the U.S. to press for an immediate cease-fire. Israeli and U.S.
officials have said they believe that a cease-fire would only allow
Hamas to be able to regroup in its fight against Israeli forces. </p>
<p>While in Amman, Blinken also visited a World Food Program warehouse
where trucks are loaded with aid for famished Palestinians in Gaza. </p>
<p>“The efforts right here to collect and distribute food to people in
need are absolutely essential,” Blinken said. “The United States has
worked from day one to open access routes into Gaza.” </p>
<p>“We continue to work on that every single day, not only to open them
but to multiply them, to maximize them and to try to get more
assistance, more effectively,” he said. “We’re determined to do
everything we possibly can to ameliorate the situation for the men,
women and children in Gaza.”</p>
<p>Israel began its military campaign to wipe out Hamas after Hamas
fighters crossed into southern Israel on October 7. Israel said about
1,200 people were killed and about 240 captives taken in the terror
attack.</p>
<p>Gaza health officials say close to 23,000 Palestinians, a large
percentage of them women and children, have been killed in Israel’s
military offensive in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The United States has stated its opposition to forcibly removing
Palestinians from Gaza. The U.S. is also working on a postwar road map
for the Palestinian territories.</p>
<p>“Gaza cannot, once again, serve as a launching pad for terrorist
attacks against Israel,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller
told VOA last week.</p>
<p>“What we ultimately want to see is Gaza and the West Bank reunited
under Palestinian leadership,” and “certainly there’s no role for Hamas
in that.”</p>

Associated Press.</p>

id="msnbcs-mehdi-hasan-quits-rather-than-accept-demotion-at-news-network">MSNBC’s
Mehdi Hasan Quits Rather Than Accept Demotion at News Network</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New york — Prominent Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan has decided to
quit MSNBC rather than accept a demotion that saw him lose a regular
Sunday night program on the network.</p>
<p>Hasan announced at the end of Sunday show that “I’ve decided to look
for a new challenge. This is not just my final episode of ‘The Mehdi
Hasan Show,’ it’s my last day at MSNBC.”</p>
<p>The network had announced in November that Hasan would lose his
weekly show after three years but would remain as an analyst and fill-in
anchor.</p>
<p>That decision, with no public explanation, launched a fruitless
petition campaign in protest by the Progressive Change Campaign
Committee. U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar called it “deeply troubling
that MSNBC is canceling his show amid a rampant rise of anti-Muslim
bigotry and suppression of Muslim voices.”</p>
<p>An MSNBC spokeswoman said Monday the network had no comment on
Hasan’s exit.</p>
<p>His final show featured an interview with Motaz Azaiza, a Palestinian
photographer who talked about the danger of working in Gaza during
Israeli military operations.</p>
<p>Hasan on Monday also forwarded a report on X, formerly Twitter, about
Palestinian children losing limbs, adding the message, “Read this
sentence. Then reread it. Then ask yourself how anyone is OK with this
level of human suffering.”</p>
<p>Hasan told viewers that he’s proud of what had been achieved on his
show.</p>
<p>“As I say: new year, new plans,” he said.</p>
<p>Hasan, who previously worked at Al Jazeera English and the Intercept,
offered no details and declined further comment on Monday.</p>
<p>To replace Hasan, MSNBC is increasing the weekend hours of Ayman
Mohyeldin, another Muslim journalist.</p>

Molly McGhee’s “Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind” (08 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Molly McGhee’s “Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind”: A
haunting novel of debt, work, dreams, and the capitalist nightmare. Hey
look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009,
2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Molly McGhee’s
“Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind” (permalink) Jonathan Abernathy You Are
Kind is Molly McGhee’s debut novel: a dreamlike tale of a public-private
partnership that hires the terminally endebted to invade the dreams of
white-collar professionals and harvest the anxieties that prevent them
from being fully productive members of the American corporate workforce:
https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/734829/jonathan-abernathy-you-are-kind-by-molly-mcghee/
Though this is McGhee’s first novel, she’s already well known in
literary circles. Her career has included stints at McSweeney’s, where
she worked on my book Information Doesn’t Want To Be Free:
https://store.mcsweeneys.net/products/information-doesn-t-want-to-be-free
And then at Tor Books, where she worked on my book Attack Surface:
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250757531/attacksurface But though
McGhee is a shrewd and skilled editor, I think of her first and foremost
as a writer, thanks to stunning essays like “America’s Dead Souls,” a
2021 Paris Review piece that described the experience of
multigenerational debt in America in incandescent, pitiless prose:
https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2021/05/17/americas-dead-souls/
McGhee’s piece struck at the heart of something profoundly wrong in
American society – the dual nature of debt, which represents a source of
freedom for the wealthy, and bondage for workers:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/19/zombie-debt/#damnation When
billionaire mass-murderers like the Sacklers amass tens of billions of
liabilities stemming from their role in deliberately starting the opioid
crisis, the courts step in to relieve them of their obligations,
allowing them to keep their blood-money:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/11/justice-delayed/#justice-redeemed And
when Silicon Valley Bank collapses due to mismanagement by ultra-wealthy
financiers, the public purse yawns open and billions flow out to ensure
that the wealthiest investors in the country stay whole:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/18/2-billion-here-2-billion-there/#socialism-for-the-rich
When predatory payday lenders target working people and force them into
bankruptcy with four-digit APRs, the government intervenes…to save the
lenders and keep workers on the hook:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/29/planned-obsolescence/#academic-fraud
“Debtor vs creditor” is the oldest class division we have. The Bronze
Age custom of jubilee – the periodic cancellation of all debts – wasn’t
some weird peccadillo. It was essential public policy, and without
jubilee, the hereditary creditor class became the arbiter of all social
priorities, destabilizing great nations and even empires by directing
production to suit their parochial needs. Societies that didn’t practice
jubilee (or halted it) collapsed:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/08/jubilant/#construire-des-passerelles
Today’s workers are debt burdened at scales and in ways that defy
comprehension, the numbers are so brain-breakingly large. Students who
take out modest loans and pay them off several times over remain
indebted decades later, with outstanding balances that vastly outstrip
the principle:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/04/kawaski-trawick/#strike-debt Workers
who quit dead-end jobs are billed for five-figure “training repayment”
bills that haunt them to the end of days:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose
Hospitals sue indigent patients at scale, siccing debt-collectors on
people who can’t pay – and were entitled to free care to begin with:
https://armandalegshow.com/episode/when-hospitals-sue-patients-part-2/
And debt collectors are drawn from the same social ranks as the debtors,
barely trained and unsupervised, engaging in lawless, constant
harassment of the debtor class:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/12/do-not-pay/#fair-debt-collection-practices-act
McGhee’s “American Dead Souls” crystallized all of this vast injustice
into a single, beautiful essay – and then McGhee crystallized things
further by posting a public resignation letter enumerating the poor pay
and working conditions in New York publishing, triggering mass,
industry-wide resignations by similarly situated junior editorial staff:
https://electricliterature.com/molly-mcghee-jonathan-abernathy-you-are-kind-interview-debut-novel-book-debt/
Thus we arrive at McGhee’s debut: a novel written by someone with a
track record for gorgeous, brutally insightful prose; incisive analysis
of the class war raging in the embers of capitalism’s American Dream;
and consequential labor organizing against the precarity and
exploitation of young workers. As you might expect, it’s fantastic.
Jonathan Abernathy is a 25 year old, debt haunted, desperately lonely
man. An orphan with a mountain of college debt, Abernathy lives in a
terrible basement apartment whose rent is just beyond his means. The
only thing that propels him out of bed and into the world are his
affirmations: Jonathan Abernathy you are kind You are well respected and
valued by your community People, including your family, love you That
these are all easily discerned lies is beside the point. Whatever gets
you through the night. We meet Jonathan as he is applying for a job that
he was recruited for in a dream. As instructed in his dream, he presents
himself at a shabby strip-mall office where an acerbic functionary
behind scratched plexiglass takes his application and informs him that
he is up for a gig run jointly by the US State Department and a
consortium of large corporate employers. If he is accepted, all of his
student debt repayments will be paused and he will no longer face wage
garnishment. What’s more, he’ll be doing the job in his sleep, which
means he’ll be able to get a day job and pull a double income – what’s
not to like? Jonathan’s job is to enter the dreams of sleeping
middle-management types in America’s largest firms – but not just any
dreams, their nightmares. Once he has entered their nightmare, Jonathan
is charged with identifying the source of their anxiety and summoning a
more senior operative who will suck up and whisk away that nagging
spectre, thus rendering the worker a more productive component of their
corporate structure. But of course, there’s more to it. As Jonathan
works through his sleeping hours, he is deprived of his own dreams. Then
there’s the question of where those captive anxieties are ending up, and
how they’re being processed, and what new products can be made from
refined nightmares. While Jonathan himself is pulling ever so slightly
out of his economic quagmire, the people around him are still
struggling. McGhee braids together three strands: the palpable misery of
being Jonathan (a proxy for all of us), the rising terror of the true
nature of his employment, and beautifully turned absurdist touches that
are laugh-aloud funny. This could be a mere novel of ennui and misery
but it’s not – it’s a novel of hilarity and fear and misery, all mixed
together in a glorious and terrible concoction that is not like anything
else you’ve ever read. Hey look at this (permalink) 2023 Word of the

<h2 id="influxdb-fdw-2.1.0-release">InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
InfluxDB FDW 2.1.0 released
</p>
<p>
We have just released version 2.1.0 of the Foreign Data Wrapper for
InfluxDB. This release can work with PostgreSQL 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16.
</p>
<p>
This release improves following item (from 2.0.0):
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Support PostgreSQL 16.0
</li>
<li>
Bug fix: Cannot delete when time series column defined as timestamptz
type
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The FDW supports following features :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports pushed down some aggregate functions: count,
stddev, sum, max, min.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports INSERT, DELETE statements.
</li>
<li>
InfluxDB FDW supports bulk INSERT by using batch_size option from
PostgreSQL version 14 or later.
</li>
<li>
WHERE clauses including timestamp, interval and now() functions are
pushed down.
</li>
<li>
LIMIT…OFFSET clauses are pushed down when there is LIMIT clause only or
both LIMIT and OFFSET.
</li>
<li>
Support schemaless mode that allows access to elements in the data file
without changing the table definition by using jsonb typed column.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Limitations :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
UPDATE is not supported.
</li>
<li>
WITH CHECK OPTION constraints is not supported. Following limitations
originate from data model and query language of InfluxDB.
</li>
<li>
Result sets have different number of rows depending on specified target
list. For example, SELECT field1 FROM t1 and SELECT field2 FROM t1
returns different number of rows if the number of points with field1 and
field2 are different in InfluxDB database.
</li>
<li>
Timestamp precision may be lost because timestamp resolution of
PostgreSQL is microseconds while that of InfluxDB is nanoseconds.
</li>
<li>
Conditions like WHERE time + interval ‘1 day’ &lt; now() do not work.
Please use WHERE time &lt; now() - interval ‘1 day’.
</li>
</ul>

of lower respiratory tract in pneumonia based on metagenomic
next-generation sequencing: a retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Pneumonia are the leading cause of death worldwide, and antibiotic
treatment remains fundamental. However, conventional sputum smears or
cultures are still inefficient for obtaining pathogenic
microorganisms.Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has shown
great value in nucleic acid detection, however, the NGS results for
lower respiratory tract microorganisms are still poorly studied.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study dealt with investigating the efficacy of mNGS in detecting
pathogens in the lower respiratory tract of patients with pulmonary
infections. A total of 112 patients admitted at the First Affiliated
Hospital of Zhengzhou University between April 30, 2018, and June 30,
2020, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from lower respiratory tract from each
patient. Routine methods (bacterial smear and culture) and mNGS were
employed for the identification of pathogenic microorganisms in BALF.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The average patient age was 53.0 years, with 94.6% (106/112) obtaining
pathogenic microorganism results. The total mNGS detection rate of
pathogenic microorganisms significantly surpassed conventional methods
(93.7% vs. 32.1%, P &lt; 0.05). Notably, 75% of patients (84/112) were
found to have bacteria by mNGS, but only 28.6% (32/112) were found to
have bacteria by conventional approaches. The most commonly detected
bacteria included <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (19.6%),
<italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> (17.9%), <italic>Pseudomonas
aeruginosa</italic> (14.3%), <italic>Staphylococcus faecium</italic>
(12.5%), <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> (12.5%), and
<italic>Haemophilus parainfluenzae</italic> (11.6%). In 29.5% (33/112)
of patients, fungi were identified using mNGS, including 23 cases of
<italic>Candida albicans</italic> (20.5%), 18 of <italic>Pneumocystis
carinii</italic> (16.1%), and 10 of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (8.9%).
However, only 7.1 % (8/112) of individuals were found to have fungi when
conventional procedures were used. The mNGS detection rate of viruses
was significantly higher than the conventional method rate (43.8%
vs. 0.9%, P &lt; 0.05). The most commonly detected viruses included
Epstein–Barr virus (15.2%), cytomegalovirus (13.4%), circovirus (8.9%),
human coronavirus (4.5%), and rhinovirus (4.5%). Only 29.4% (33/112) of
patients were positive, whereas 5.4% (6/112) of patients were negative
for both detection methods as shown by Kappa analysis, indicating poor
consistency between the two methods (P = 0.340; Kappa analysis).

modulating functions of probiotic Lactiplantibacillus plantarum in
particulate matter-associated pulmonary inflammation</h2>

Pulmonary disease represents a substantial global health burden.
Increased air pollution, especially fine particulate matter
(PM<sub>2.5</sub>) is the most concerned proportion of air pollutants to
respiratory health. PM<sub>2.5</sub> may carry or combine with other
toxic allergens and heavy metals, resulting in serious respiratory
allergies and anaphylactic reactions in the host. Available treatment
options such as antihistamines, steroids, and avoiding
allergens/dust/pollutants could be limited due to certain side effects
and immense exposure to air pollutants, especially in most polluted
countries. In this mini-review, we summarized how PM<sub>2.5</sub>
triggers respiratory hyperresponsiveness and inflammation, and the
probiotic <italic>Lactiplantibacillus plantarum</italic> supplementation
could minimize the risk of the same. <italic>L. plantarum</italic> may
confer beneficial effects in PM<sub>2.5</sub>-associated pulmonary
inflammation due to significant antioxidant potential. We discussed
<italic>L. plantarum’s</italic> effect on PM<sub>2.5</sub>-induced
reactive oxygen species (ROS), inflammatory cytokines, lipid
peroxidation, and DNA damage. Available preclinical evidence shows
<italic>L. plantarum</italic> induces gut-lung axis, SCFA, GABA, and
other neurotransmitter signaling via gut microbiota modulation. SCFA
signals are important in maintaining lung homeostasis and regulating
intracellular defense mechanisms in alveolar cells. However, significant
research is needed in this direction to contemplate <italic>L.
plantarum</italic>’s therapeutic potential in pulmonary allergies.

<p>
<italic>Sanghuangporus</italic>, also known as “Sanghuang” in China, is
a well-known genus of traditional Chinese medicinal macrofungi. To make
more effective use of <italic>Sanghuangporus</italic> resources, we
completed the first genome assembly and annotation of a monokaryon
strain of <italic>S. weigelae</italic> in the present study. A 33.96-Mb
genome sequence was assembled as 13 contigs, leading to prediction of
9377 protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic and average nucleotide identity
analyses indicated that the <italic>S. weigelae</italic> genome is
closely related to those of other <italic>Sanghuangporus</italic>
species in evolutionary tree, which clustered in one clade. Collinearity

id="xenophagy-receptors-optn-and-p62-and-autophagy-modulator-dram1-independently-promote-the-zebrafish-host-defense-against-mycobacterium-marinum">Xenophagy
receptors Optn and p62 and autophagy modulator Dram1 independently
promote the zebrafish host defense against Mycobacterium marinum</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Anti-bacterial autophagy, also known as xenophagy, is a crucial innate
immune process that helps maintain cellular homeostasis by targeting
invading microbes. This defense pathway is widely studied in the context
of infections with mycobacteria, the causative agents of human
tuberculosis and tuberculosis-like disease in animal models. Our
previous work in a zebrafish tuberculosis model showed that host defense
against <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> (Mm) is impaired by
deficiencies in xenophagy receptors, optineurin (Optn) or sequestome 1
(p62), and Damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (Dram1). However, the
interdependency of these receptors and their interaction with Dram1
remained unknown. In the present study, we used single and double
knockout zebrafish lines in combination with overexpression experiments.
We show that Optn and p62 can compensate for the loss of each other’s
function, as their overexpression restores the infection susceptibility
of the mutant phenotypes. Similarly, Dram1 can compensate for
deficiencies in Optn and p62, and, vice versa, Optn and p62 compensate
for the loss of Dram1, indicating that these xenophagy receptors and
Dram1 do not rely on each other for host defense against Mm. In
agreement, Dram1 overexpression in <italic>optn/p62</italic> double
mutants restored the interaction of autophagosome marker Lc3 with Mm.
Finally, <italic>optn/p62</italic> double mutants displayed more severe
infection susceptibility than the single mutants. Taken together, these
results suggest that Optn and p62 do not function downstream of each
other in the anti-mycobacterial xenophagy pathway, and that the
Dram1-mediated defense against Mm infection does not rely on specific
xenophagy receptors.

the invading extracellular and intracellular FnBp+ bacteria from
respiratory epithelial cells by autophagy mediated through
FnBp-Fn-Integrin α5β1 axis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
We previously found that the respiratory epithelial cells could
eliminate the invaded <italic>group A streptococcus</italic> (GAS)
through autophagy induced by binding a fibronectin (Fn) binding protein
(FnBp) expressed on the surface of GAS to plasma protein Fn and its
receptor integrin α5β1 of epithelial cells. Is autophagy initiated by
FnBp<sup>+</sup> bacteria via FnBp-Fn-Integrin α5β1 axis a common event
in respiratory epithelial cells?
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We chose <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<italic>S. aureus/S.
a</italic>) and <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> (<italic>L.
monocytogenes/L. m</italic>) as representatives of extracellular and
intracellular FnBp<sup>+</sup> bacteria, respectively. The FnBp of them
was purified and the protein function was confirmed by western blot,
viable bacteria count, confocal and pull-down. The key molecule
downstream of the action axis was detected by IP, mass spectrometry and
bio-informatics analysis.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
We found that different FnBp from both <italic>S. aureus</italic> and
<italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> could initiate autophagy through
FnBp-Fn-integrin α5β1 axis and this could be considered a universal
event, by which host tries to remove invading bacteria from epithelial
cells. Importantly, we firstly reported that S100A8, as a key molecule
downstream of integrin β1 chain, is highly expressed upon activation of
integrin α5β1, which in turn up-regulates autophagy.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Various FnBp from FnBp<sup>+</sup> bacteria have the ability to initiate
autophagy via FnBp-Fn-Integrin α5β1 axis to promote the removal of
invading bacteria from epithelial cells in the presence of fewer
invaders. S100A8 is a key molecule downstream of Integrin α5β1 in this
autophagy pathway.

<p>
Lately, the bacterial multidrug resistance has been a reason to public
health concerning around world. The development of new pharmacology
therapies against infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria is
urgent. In this work, we developed 10 NLC formulations composed of
essential oils (EO), vegetable butter and surfactant. The formulations
were evaluated for long-term and thermal cycling stability studies in
terms of (particle size, polydispersion index and Zeta potential).
<italic>In vitro</italic> antimicrobial assays were performed using disk
diffusion test and by the determination of the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) performed with fresh and a year-old NLC. The most
promising system and its excipients were structurally characterized
through experimental methodologies (FTIR-ATR, DSC and FE-SEM). Finally,
this same formulation was studied through nanotoxicity assays on the
chicken embryo model, analyzing different parameters, as viability and
weight changes of embryos and annexes. All the developed formulations
presented long-term physicochemical and thermal stability. The
formulation based on cinnamon EO presented <italic>in vitro</italic>
activity against strains of <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>,

reactive immunomes of Ehrlichia chaffeensis and E. canis are diverse and

<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
For decades, the defined antibody reactive proteins of <italic>Ehrlichia
chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E. canis</italic> were limited to a
small group with linear antibody epitopes. Recently, our laboratory has
utilized an immunomics-based approach to rapidly screen and identify
undefined <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E.
canis</italic> antigenic proteins and antibody epitopes. In this study,
we analyzed the remaining portion (~50%) of the <italic>E.
chaffeensis</italic> and <italic>E. canis</italic> proteomes
(<italic>n</italic> = 444 and <italic>n =</italic> 405 proteins,
respectively), that were not examined in previous studies, to define the
complete immunomes of these important pathogens. Almost half of the
<italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> proteins screened (196/444) reacted with
antibodies in convalescent HME patient sera, while only 43 <italic>E.
canis</italic> proteins reacted with CME dog sera. New major
immunoreactive proteins were identified in <italic>E.
chaffeensis</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and <italic>E.
canis</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 1), increasing the total number of
<italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> (n = 14) and <italic>E. canis</italic>
proteins (n = 18) that exhibited antibody reactivity comparable to
well-defined major antigenic proteins (TRP120 and TRP19). All of the
<italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> but only some <italic>E. canis</italic>
major immunoreactive proteins contained major conformation-dependent
antibody epitopes. The <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> immunoreactive
proteins were generally small (&lt; 250 amino acids; ~27kDa) and the
<italic>E. canis</italic> proteins were slightly larger (&gt; 320 amino
acids; ~35 kDa). The majority of these new <italic>Ehrlichia</italic>
major immunoreactive proteins were predicted to be type I secreted
effectors, some of which contained transmembrane domains.
Characterization of the immunomes of <italic>E. chaffeensis</italic> and
<italic>E. canis</italic> and understanding the host specific
<italic>Ehrlichia</italic> immune responses will facilitate
identification of protective antigens and define the biophysical epitope
characteristics vital to effective vaccine development for the
ehrlichioses.

psittaci pneumonia- a retrospective analysis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Research into the effects of <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic>
pneumonia on the liver has emerged in the last few years. However, no
studies have systematically described liver injury in patients with
psittacosis. We present the first report on the clinical features and
risk factors of liver injury in patients with <italic>Chlamydia
psittaci</italic> pneumonia.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We retrospectively collected the clinical parameters for 46 patients
with <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic> pneumonia admitted to Jinhua
Central Hospital from January 2019 to February 2023. We analyzed the
liver function parameters and summarized the clinical characteristics
and risk factors of liver injury.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Among the 46 patients, 39 (84.8%) had abnormal liver function, and 23
(50.0%) had liver injury. The ratio of patients with a history of
alcohol consumption (39.1% vs. 4.3%, <italic>P</italic> =0.004) or
severe pneumonia (56.5% vs. 26.1%, <italic>P</italic> =0.036) was higher
in the liver injury group compared with the non-liver injury group.
Laboratory tests showed higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the
liver injury group (<italic>P &lt;</italic>0.001). The optimal cut-off
LDH level associated with liver injury was 473 IU/L as determined by ROC
curve analysis. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis
demonstrated that a history of alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] =
11.251; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.022 ~ 123.897,
<italic>P</italic> =0.048) and an LDH level of ≥ 473IU/L (OR = 11.635,
95% CI = 1.832 ~ 73.869, <italic>P</italic> =0.009) were independent
risk factors for liver injury.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
A history of alcohol consumption and an LDH level of over 473 IU/L are
independent risk factors for <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic>
pneumonia-related liver injury. It is recommended that particular
attention be given to monitoring and evaluating liver function
parameters when treating patients with <italic>Chlamydia
psittaci</italic> pneumonia who have a high LDH level and history of
alcohol consumption.

</title>
<p>
Nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> is a significant public health

study aims to characterize the nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic>
strains isolated from patients in China.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A total of 19 nontyphoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains were
characterized through serovar identification, antimicrobial
susceptibility testing (AST), biofilm formation assessment. Genetic
relatedness was determined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE). WGS was employed to decipher the resistance mechanism and to
contextualize the <italic>S.</italic> serovar Mbandaka strains among
previously sequenced isolates in China. The biofilm associated
<italic>mrkA</italic> gene was examined by PCR.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The predominant serovar identified was <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis,
followed by <italic>S.</italic> Mbandaka, <italic>S.</italic> Thompson,
<italic>S.</italic> Livingston, <italic>S.</italic> Alachua, and
<italic>S.</italic> Infantis. PFGE analysis indicated a notable genetic
similarity among the <italic>S.</italic> Mbandaka isolates. Phylogenetic
analysis suggested that these strains were likely derived from a single
source that had persisted in China for over five years. One multidrug
resistance (MDR) <italic>S.</italic> Enteritidis isolate carried a
highly transferable IncB/O/K/Z plasmid with
<italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub>. One <italic>S.</italic>
Thompson strain, harboring the <italic>mrkABCDF</italic> operon in an
IncX1 plasmid, isolated from cutaneous lesions, demonstrated robust
biofilm formation. However, no <italic>mrkABCDF</italic> loci were
detected in other strains.

Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Our study emphasizes the importance of persisted surveillance and prompt
response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> infections to protect public
health. The dissemination of
<italic>bla</italic><sub>CTX-M-15</sub>-harboring IncB/O/K/Z plasmid and
the spread of virulent <italic>mrkABCDF</italic> operon among

belonging to five International Clones collected from hospitals of
Alexandria, Egypt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Multidrug resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is one of
the most important nosocomial pathogens worldwide. During the last
decades it has become a major threat for healthcare settings due to the
high antibiotic resistance rates among these isolates. Many resistance
determinants are coded by conjugative or mobilizable plasmids,
facilitating their dissemination. The majority of plasmids harbored by
<italic>Acinetobacter</italic> species are less than 20 Kb, however,
high molecular weight elements are the most clinically relevant since
they usually contain antibiotic resistance genes. The aim of this work
was to describe, classify and determine the genetic content of plasmids
harbored by carbapem resistant <italic>A. baumannii</italic> isolates
belonging to predominant clonal lineages circulating in hospitals from
Alexandria, Egypt. The isolates were subjected to S1-Pulsed Field Gel
Electrophoresis experiments to identify high molecular weight plasmids.
To further analyze the plasmid content and the genetic localization of
the antibiotic resistance genes, isolates were sequenced by Illumina
Miseq and MinION Mk1C and a hybrid assembly was performed using
Unicycler v0.5.0. Plasmids were detected with MOBsuite 3.0.3 and
Copla.py v.1.0 and mapped using the online software Proksee.ca.
Replicase genes were further analyzed through a BLAST against the
<italic>Acinetobacter</italic> Plasmid Typing database. Eleven plasmids
ranging in size from 4.9 to 205.6 Kb were characterized and mapped. All
isolates contained plasmids, and, in many cases, more than two elements
were identified. Antimicrobial resistance genes such as
<italic>bla</italic><sub>OXA-23</sub>,
<italic>bla</italic><sub>GES-like</sub>, <italic>aph(3’)-VI</italic> and
<italic>qacEΔ1</italic> were found in likely conjugative large plasmids;
while virulence determinants such as septicolysin or TonB-dependent
receptors were identified in plasmids of small size. Some of these
resistance determinants were, in turn, located within transposons and
class 1 integrons. Among the identified plasmids, the majority encoded
proteins belonging to the Rep_3 family, but replicases of the RepPriCT_1
(Aci6) family were also identified. Plasmids are of high interest as
antibiotic resistance control tools, since they may be used as genetic
markers for antibiotic resistance and virulence, and also as targets for
the development of compounds that can inhibit transfer processes.

<p>date: 2024-01-09, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://i4oa.org/" target="_blank">Initiative for Open
Abstracts (I4OA)</a> was launched in September 2020 to advocate and
promote the unrestricted availability of the abstracts of the world’s
scholarly publications, particularly journal articles and book chapters,
in trusted repositories where they are open and machine-accessible. I4OA
calls on all scholarly publishers to open the abstracts of their
published works and, where possible, to submit them to Crossref.
</p>
<p>
Since the launch of I4OA, we have been tracking the openness of
abstracts for all Crossref members over time (for data and code, see
this <a href="https://github.com/bmkramer/I4OA" target="_blank">GitHub
repository</a>). For a subset of 40+, mostly larger, publishers, the
proportion of current journal articles (published in the current year
and preceding two years) that have abstracts deposited in Crossref is
shown in a
<a href="https://i4oa.org/#:~:text=are%20shown%20in-,orange,-." target="_blank">chart
on the I4OA website</a>, which is updated quarterly (Figure 1).

<em>Figure 1: Proportion of current journal articles from selected
publishers that have open abstracts in Crossref. Data collected on
January 1, 2024 for publication years 2021-2023. Publishers already
supporting I4OA are shown in orange.</em>
</p>
<p>
These longitudinal data and accompanying visualisations allow us to
identify and highlight good examples from 2023: publishers (both large
and small) who newly started to make abstracts openly available last
year and/or who managed to get the proportion of their articles with
open abstracts close to 100%<sup>1</sup>.
</p>
<p>
While we highlight some of these examples below in our ‘Hall of Fame’,
it’s important to also acknowledge all the publishers that already were
depositing abstracts to Crossref for most or all of their journal
articles prior to 2023, thereby contributing to the availability of
abstracts as part of a rich ecosystem of open metadata,

others to use and build upon</a>. 
</p>
<h2 id="hall-of-fame---part-1-publishers-included-in-i4oa-visualisation">
Hall of Fame - Part 1: publishers included in I4OA visualisation
</h2>
<p>
For the set of (mostly larger) publishers included in the visualisation
on the I4OA website, Figure 2 shows the difference in the proportion of
abstracts available in Crossref between January and December 2023 for
journal articles published in 2021-2023.
</p>
<p>
A number of publishers stand out from this figure:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Wiley</strong> announced in
<a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/network/publishing/research-publishing/open-access/wiley-expands-commitment-to-open-research" target="_blank">October
2022</a> that it was joining I4OA and would be making abstracts
available through Crossref. In August 2023, Wiley started to deposit
abstracts to Crossref, and at the end of 2023, the proportion of current
journal articles with open abstracts was 77%.
</p>
<p>
This makes Wiley the first of the four largest traditional commercial
publishers to deposit abstracts for the majority of journal articles
they publish. Springer Nature does this only for their current open
access articles, while Elsevier and Taylor &amp; Francis<sup>2</sup> do
not yet provide abstracts to Crossref at all. SAGE, the fifth largest
traditional commercial publisher, was a founding member of I4OA and has
open abstracts for 85% of current journal articles. <br><br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Among society publishers, the <strong>American Geophysical Union
(AGU)</strong> went from 7% to 99% open abstracts for current journal
articles last year, which is a great achievement. The publishing arm of
the <strong>American Institute of Physics (AIP Publishing)</strong>
joins them in reaching close to 100% open abstracts, going from 41% to
95% in 2023.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
<sup>1</sup>Depending on the type of journal(s) of a given publisher,
the maximal coverage of open abstracts will often be somewhat below
100%, as in Crossref, all journal content is assigned the type ‘journal
article’. This includes e.g. editorials, letters to the editor and other
publication types that are not always expected to have abstracts.
</p>
<p>
<sup>2</sup>The numbers for Wiley and Taylor &amp; Francis do not
include Hindawi and F1000 Research, respectively, as these have separate
Crossref member IDs. As most full open access publishers, both Hindawi
and F1000 Research have high proportions of open abstracts (81% and 98%,
respectively).
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>CAIRN</strong> and <strong>Project Muse</strong>, two publishing
platforms in the humanities and social sciences representing a number of
individual publishers, both started including abstracts in the metadata
they provide to Crossref in 2023. At the end of 2023, CAIRN had
abstracts available for 41% of current journal articles, while Project
Muse was just starting out at 5%. Both will hopefully increase further
this coming year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Returning to traditional commercial publishers, <strong>Wolters Kluwer
Health</strong>, part of Wolters Kluwer, had seen a slow growth in the
proportion of journal articles with open abstracts in the years prior to
2023, going from 2% to 10%. However, they showed a rapid increase in
2023, ending the year with 52% open abstracts.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
While it is good to see publishers who have publicly committed their
<a href="https://i4oa.org/#:~:text=Publishers%20supporting%20I4OA" target="_blank">support
for I4OA</a> follow through with opening their abstracts (like Wiley and
AIP), it is also very encouraging to see publishers who are not (yet)
listed as I4OA supporters do so. This shows a growing awareness and
action on this issue beyond advocacy through I4OA alone. And of course,
we would love to list these publishers on our website as official
supporters of I4OA!
</p>
<p>
Figure 2 also shows some cases where the proportion of open abstracts
has gone down during the year. This can be due to temporary technical
issues in depositing abstracts (as was the case for Hindawi).
Theoretically, the proportion of open abstracts can also go down when
publishers stop providing abstracts altogether during the year, but we
have not observed that to be the case.

Hall of Fame - Part 2: other publishers
</h2>
<p>
Among the many publishers not included in the limited selection shown in
the I4OA visualisation, there are also some interesting highlights of
publishers either starting out to deposit abstracts (and reaching a
sizeable proportion) or having deposited open abstracts for almost all
their current journal articles in 2023. The examples below drew our
attention in 2023; they include a number of medium-sized publishers as
well as a group of smaller publishers that deserve special attention.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO)</strong> went
from 0% to 42% open abstracts in 2023. However, from January 2024
onwards, several EMBO journals were transferred to Springer Nature, so
EMBO can no longer be tracked at publisher level in Crossref. It will
still be possible to look at the development of open abstracts for
individual EMBO journals.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)</strong>, a
medium-sized publisher, started to deposit abstracts in 2023, reaching
33% open abstracts for current journal articles at the end of the year.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Acoustical Society of America (ASA)</strong> had open
abstracts for almost all their current journal articles at the end
of 2023, increasing from 50% to 97%.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finally, in the second quarter of 2023, a group of <strong>over 200
smaller Turkish publishers</strong> saw large increases in their
coverage of open abstracts, resulting in open abstracts for 95%-100% of
their current journal articles. Consultation with Crossref pointed to
the potential supporting role of
<a href="https://dergipark.org.tr/en/" target="_blank">DergiPark</a>,
one of the largest Crossref sponsors in Turkey. This is a great example
of developments in open metadata at smaller publishers.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="looking-forward">
Looking forward 
</h2>
<p>
At the beginning of 2024, the proportion of current journal articles
published by Crossref members with open abstracts has reached 49.7%, up
from 20.7% when I4OA was launched in September 2020. This is thanks to a
growing number of publishers who are depositing abstracts to Crossref,
often depositing open abstracts for close to 100% of their journal
articles.
</p>
<p>
This blog post has highlighted a number of publishers who contributed to
this growth in the availability of open abstracts in 2023. We hope these
examples will inspire other publishers to start doing the same and are
looking forward to following the growth in the availability of open
abstracts in 2024.
</p>
<p>
For publishers that started to deposit abstracts in recent years and are
doing so for newly published articles only, our data on open abstracts
for current journal articles will look better in 2024 than in 2023, as
only articles published in the current year and two preceding years are
taken into account.
</p>
<p>
However, the benefits of having abstracts openly available from a
central location such as Crossref (both for direct usage and for
integration in other open scholarly infrastructures) are not limited to
recent publications only. Hopefully, publishers currently depositing
abstracts to Crossref will continue to do so both for newly published
articles as well as for the backfiles of journal articles already
published.
</p>
<p>
Publishers who would like to be added to the list of I4OA supporters, or
who would like more information on how to deposit abstracts for both new
and existing journal articles, are very welcome to
<a href="mailto:openabstracts@gmail.com">reach out to I4OA</a>. More
information about open abstracts in general, and I4OA in particular, can
also be found in the
<a href="https://i4oa.org/faqs.html" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the I4OA
website.

MSI is introducing a lot of new gaming laptops this week, and most are
big and powerful beasts with 14th-gen Intel Meteor Lake-H or Raptor
Lake-HX processors and NVIDIA graphics. But a few are smaller, lighter

through the eyes of a musl distribution maintainer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>systemd, as a service manager, is not actually a bad piece of
software by itself. The fact it can act as both a service manager and an
inetd(8) replacement is really cool. The unit file format is very nice
and expressive. Defining mechanism and leaving policy to the
administrator is a good design. Of course, nothing exists in a vacuum. I
don’t like the encouragement to link daemons to libsystemd for better
integration – all of the useful integrations can be done with more
portable measures. And I really don’t like the fact they consider glibc
to be “the Linux API” when musl, Bionic, and other libcs exist. I’d like
to dive into detail on the good and the bad of systemd, as seen through
my eyes as all of: end user, administrator, and developer. ↫ awilfox
awilfox is a maintainer of Adélie Linux, which does not use systemd, but
this blog post is one of the few reasonable, well-written, and
substantiated critiques of systemd – as opposed to the usual mindless
screeching you usually hear about systemd. A great read.</p>

<h2 id="the-texas-grid-is-bracing-for-another-freeze">The Texas Grid Is
Bracing for Another Freeze</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTAyODg3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwODQ3NjE4Mn0.voJaQFGHi7ct3tyAAaIdsE_mL_fPwa496eqRbTcY-eg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Winter has begun to arrive in Texas. In the panhandle, temperatures are
expected to get as low as 22 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, while the
National Weather Service forecast office in Amarillo told residents to
<a href="https://www.weather.gov/ama/novcold" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brace
themselves</a> for Tuesday, when “temperatures will plummet to some 20
to 30 degrees below normal.” The more populous parts of the state can
expect more cold weather later this week and next; in Austin, lows could
dip below freezing by Sunday and into next week, while in Dallas, the
thermometer could reach down to 25 this weekend. Austin could have ice,
possibly leading to snarled traffic and the occasional downed power line
thanks to a gliding car.
</p>
<p>
None of this is any match for Winter Storm Uri, which paralyzed the
state in February 2021, causing a multi-day blackout that killed more
than 200 people<strong>. </strong>But any winter cold stretch in Texas
will bring up questions about how the state’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/how-the-texas-power-grid-has-dodged-disaster-so-far" target="_blank">unique
electricity system</a> will handle it. “It’s deep in the Texas psyche
now, and anytime it gets really hot or really cold the grid is front of
mind,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of
Texas.
</p>
<p>
The vast majority of Texas is on its own electric grid, and the state’s
electricity market for businesses and households is far less regulated
than anywhere else in the country — Texas households have more options
about where they can purchase electricity from, for instance, and the
offerings tend to be less standardized.<strong> </strong>While Texas
does typically have low electricity prices, the system can also lead to
massive spikes in what households pay. After Uri, when some customers
who did still have power faced
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/us/texas-storm-electric-bills.html" target="_blank">charges
in the five figures</a>, utilities regulators
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/texas-power-prices-surge-6-000-as-grid-calls-for-conservation" target="_blank">capped
prices</a> at $5,000 per megawatt hour.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2023/home-electrification-heat-pumps-gas-furnace/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As
in much of the South</a>, Texan households are more like to
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47116#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20U.S.%20Census,to%20fan%20heat%20throughout%20houses.">use
electricity</a> to heat their homes, which makes a blackout during a
prolonged cold snap extra deadly. The failures during Uri triggered a
slew of
<a href="https://www.ferc.gov/news-events/news/final-report-february-2021-freeze-underscores-winterization-recommendations" target="_blank">reports</a>
and
<a href="https://www.rtoinsider.com/62278-ferc-enforcement-report-closed-probe-winter-storm-uri/" target="_blank">investigations</a>
into what happened and who profited from it. The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission found a lack of weatherization across the board,
but especially in the natural gas system, which was behind 87% of all
generation outages, some due to distribution failures and others due to
power production issues. There were
<a href="https://energy.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/UTAustin%20%282021%29%20EventsFebruary2021TexasBlackout%2020210714.pdf" target="_blank">wind
outages</a>, as well, thanks to iced turbine blades.
</p>
<p>
“ERCOT” — the Texas electricity authority — “says they’re ready, but
they say they’re ready all the time,” said Ed Hirs, an energy economist
and lecturer at the University of Houston. “There’s a credibility
issue.”
</p>
<p>
There has been substantial winterization across the entire system since
Uri, Rhodes said. Considering the expected lows will be around 12
degrees higher this week than they were during Uri, Rhodes added, “if
any power trips offline for temperature issues, then that would worry me
because that means we haven’t done our jobs.”

OS: microkernel operating system for the cloud written in Rust</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Motūrus project builds a simple, fast, and secure operating system
(Motūrus OS) for the cloud. In more specific terms, Motūrus OS
(sometimes called Motor OS), is a new operating system targeting virtual
machine-based workloads such as web serving, “serverless”, edge caching,
etc. Motūrus OS is a microkernel-based operating system, built in Rust,
that targets virtualized workloads exclusively. It currently supports
x64 KVM-based virtual machines, and can run in either Qemu or Cloud
Hypervisor. Rust is the language of Motūrus OS: not only it is
implemented in Rust, it also exposes its ABI in Rust, not C. ↫ Motūrus
OS GitHub page At this point, there are more alternative operating
systems written in Rust than there are Linux distributions, but you’re
not hearing any complaints from me. While not all of these will have a
bright future, they’ll teach a lot of people valuable skills and
introduce a lot of people to the concept of alternative operating
systems.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Hiking gear exists so that, when nature tries to kill you, it is a
little less likely to succeed. Sometimes this gear’s life-saving
function is obvious — a Nalgene to carry extra water so you don’t die of
thirst, or a fist-sized first-aid kit so you don’t bleed to death —
while other things you don’t necessarily purchase with the thought that
they might one day save your life. Like, say,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.1cb8e005-16ec-9c68-5406-0e887f58a992?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
small Swiss Army Knife</a>. Or, in my case, a raincoat.
</p>
<p>
Last summer, on a casual day hike in Mount Rainier National Park, my
family was overtaken by a storm that, quite literally, rose up out of
nowhere. It had been a sunny, clear day when we left the parking lot; at
four miles in, we were being lashed by hail and gale-force winds on an
exposed alpine trail, with no trees or boulders nearby for shelter.
</p>
<p>
Then, one member of our hiking party tripped.
</p>
<p>
In the split second before she stood up and confirmed she could walk out
on her own, my mind raced through what I had in my pack. Stupidly, I had
nothing to assemble a makeshift shelter, no warmer layers. But I
<em>did</em> have my blue waterproof rainshell. In weather as extreme as
the storm off Rainier that day, keeping dry is essential; if we’d had to
wait out the rain due to a broken ankle, we’d have become soaked and
hypothermic long before help arrived. My raincoat, I realized during
those terrifying seconds, could save my life.
</p>
<p>
But what made my raincoat so trustworthy that day on the mountain could
also, in theory, kill me — or, more likely, kill or sicken any of the
thousands of people who live downstream of the manufacturers that make
waterproofing chemicals and the landfills where waterproof clothing is
incinerated or interred. Outdoor apparel is typically
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/ultraprocessed-fashion-forever-chemicals" target="_self">ultraprocessed</a>
and treated using perfluoroalkyl and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, a
class of water- and stain-resistant “forever chemicals” that are more
commonly referred to as PFAS (pronounced “pee-fass”). After decades of
work by environmental groups and health advocates, states and retailers
are finally banning the sale of textiles that have been treated with the
chemicals, which in the outdoor industry often manifest in the form of
Gore-Tex membranes or “durable water repellent” treatments.
</p>
<p>
These bans are fast approaching: Beginning
<a href="https://www.saferstates.org/press-room/first-in-nation-ban-on-pfas-forever-chemicals-in-menstrual-products-cleaning-ingredients-cookware-and-dental-floss-signed-by-minnesota-governor-today/#:~:text=Several%20states%20have%20adopted%20restrictions,many%20categories%20of%20textile%20products." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in
2025</a> — less than 12 months from now — California will forbid the
sale of most PFAS-treated textiles; New York will restrict them in
apparel; and Washington will regulate stain- and waterproofing
treatments, with similar regulations pending or approved in a number of
other states. Following
<a href="https://toxicfreefuture.org/press-room/rei-announces-it-will-ban-pfas-in-all-textiles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pressure
from activists</a>, the nation’s largest outdoor retailer, REI, also
announced last winter that it will ban PFAS in all the textile products
and cookware sold in its stores starting fall 2024;
<a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/812551136/files/doc_downloads/csr/Restricted-Substances-List-(RSL)-April-2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Dick’s
Sporting Goods</a> will also eliminate PFAS from its brand-name
clothing.
</p>
<p>
This will upend the outdoor apparel industry. Some of the best coats in
the world — legendary gear like Arc’teryx’s Beta AR and the
<a href="https://toxicfreefuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/toxic-convenience.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traditional
construction</a> of the
<a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/say-goodbye-to-forever-chemicals/story-133800.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Patagonia
Torrentshell</a> — use, or until recently used, PFAS in their
waterproofing processes or in their jackets’ physical membranes. Though
the bans frequently allow vague, temporary loopholes for gear intended
for “extreme wet conditions” or “expeditions,” such exceptions will be
closed off by the end of the 2020s. (Patagonia has “committed to making
all membranes and water-repellent finishes without [PFAS] by 2025,” Gin
Ando, a spokesperson for the company, told me; Arc’teryx spokesperson
Amy May shared that the company is “committed to moving towards
PFAS-free materials in its products.”)

Even if you aren’t buying expedition-level gear, your closet almost
certainly contains PFAS. A 2022 study by Toxic-Free Future found the
chemicals
<a href="https://toxicfreefuture.org/research/pfas-in-stain-water-resistant-products-study/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in
nearly 75%</a> of products labeled as waterproof or stain-resistant.
Another study found that the concentration of fluorotelomer alcohols,
which are used in the production of PFAS, was
<a href="https://ipen.org/sites/default/files/documents/clothing-chemicals-complete-web-final05.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">30
times higher</a> inside stores that sold outdoor clothing than in other
workplaces.

The reason outdoor companies have historically loved PFAS so much is
simple: The chemicals are unrivaled in their water repellency. PFAS are
manufactured chains of fluorine-carbon bonds that are
<em>incredibly</em> difficult to break (the precise number of carbons is
also used in the naming process, which is why you’ll hear them called
“C8” or “C6,” sometimes, as well). Because of this strong bond, other
molecules slip off when they come into contact with the fluorine-carbon
chain; you can observe this in
<a href="https://www.ecocenter.org/test-your-products-pfas-water-droplet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
DIY test at home</a> by dripping water onto a fabric and watching it
roll off, leaving your garment perfectly dry.
</p>
<p>
It is also because of this bond that PFAS are so stubbornly persistent —
in the environment, certainly, but also in us. An estimated 98% to 99%
of people have
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-pfas-are-so-impervious-and-who-is-most-at-risk-from-the-forever-chemicals" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">traces
of PFAS</a> in their bodies. Researchers have found the molecules in
breast milk, rainwater, and Antarctica’s snow. We inhale them in dust
and drink them in our tap water, and because
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/8/25/23318667/pfas-forever-chemicals-safety-drinking-water" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">they
look a little like a fatty acid to our bodies</a>, they can cause health
problems that we’re only beginning to grasp. So far, PFAS have been

<p>
Chemical companies and industry groups
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/06/05/forever-chemicals-state-bans-pfas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">often
argue</a> that certain PFAS are demonstrably worse than others; the
so-called “long-chain” molecules, for instance, are thought to have
higher bioaccumulation and toxicity potential, and have mostly been
replaced by “short-chain” molecules. But as Arlene Blum, a pioneering
mountaineer and the founder of the Green Science Policy Institute, an
environmental advocacy organization that opposes PFAS, told me, “in all
the cases that we’ve studied,” forever chemicals have been found “to be
harmful in one way or another,” whether they’re
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385894719319096?fbclid=IwAR3zIeEDnluiG2QKSGTh4HN0Q-sIsBvr_WuZAeS6dkrIshQBWyWQ8JF-8gA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">short
or long</a>.
</p>
<p>
From a health perspective, the good news is that activists are winning.
While initial efforts to protect humans and the environment from PFAS
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/questions-and-answers-drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-pfos-genx-chemicals-and-pfbs#q2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in
the mid-2000s</a> resulted only in the voluntary phase-out of long-chain
chemicals like PFOA and PFOS, the new laws target the entire class of
thousands of compounds to prevent an ongoing game of whack-a-mole with
chemical manufacturers. (A recent report
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/07/us-chemical-industry-110-million-thwart-pfas-legislation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">by<em>
The Guardian</em></a> found that the chemical industry spent $110
million in the last two U.S. election cycles trying to thwart or slow
the various bans.) Public pressure campaigns mounted against ostensibly
sustainability-minded companies like REI have prompted store-initiated
PFAS bans that will also influence future gear sold in the United
States. (REI was long
<a href="https://grist.org/health/outdoor-industry-ditches-forever-chemicals-rei-pfas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
PFAS laggard</a>, and was even hit in 2022 with a
<a href="https://truthinadvertising.org/class-action/reis-waterproof-apparel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">class-action
lawsuit</a> over allegedly marketing PFAS-containing clothes as
“sustainable.” The company declined to comment for this story. Dick’s
Sporting Goods did not respond to requests for comment.)
</p>
<p>
But as the days tick closer to the first PFAS bans coming into effect in
stores this fall, outdoor apparel companies are still scrambling to
redesign their clothing. Some alternatives to PFAS do exist — Blum
swears by her PFAS-free Black Diamond jacket — though even the most
ardent supporters of the forever chemical bans will admit the
waterproofing alternatives haven’t 100% caught up yet.
</p>
<p>
“The main concern that most people have in the industry is the amount of
work that it’s going to take to meet these guidelines,” Chris Steinkamp,
the head of advocacy at the trade association Snowsports Industries
America, told me. “Because PFAS is omnipresent. Unfortunately, they’re
pretty much in everything.”
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Many outdoor apparel companies genuinely want to comply with the coming
bans, Karolína Brabcová, the campaign manager for toxic chemicals in
consumer products at Arnika, a Czech environmental non-profit, told me.
“It’s not such a matter of greenwashing here,” she said. “It’s more
about the fact that you’ve got the chemical industry on one side and the
downstream users joining the consumers on the other side. And the
downstream users don’t know everywhere the PFAS are being used; it’s a
business secret.”
</p>
<p>
In one case
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-02-02/raincoats-without-toxic-pfas-chemicals-are-coming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">detailed
by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the Swedish company Fjällräven had stopped
using PFAS in its products, only to learn from a 2012 Greenpeace
investigation that the chemicals were still present in its apparel. “A
supplier using fluorochemistry on another company’s products was
cross-contaminating Fjällräven’s,” the <em>Bloomberg</em> authors write,
adding that “subsequent testing revealed” just having “products in
stores near products from other companies that used the chemicals still
resulted in low levels of contamination.”
</p>
<p>
It isn’t always the case, however, that clothing manufacturers are
unwitting victims of chemical sloppiness. Some apparel companies have
taken advantage of the alphabet soup of chemical names to look more
sustainable than they are. “We’ve seen in recent years products labeled
as ‘PFOA-free’ or ‘PFOS-free,’ which suggests that they do not contain
the long-chain PFAS that have largely been phased out from production in
the United States,” Blum warned me. “That’s really misleading because
oftentimes it’s a signal a product likely contains other PFAS chemicals,
which may be just as persistent and may also be quite toxic in
production to disposal.”
</p>
<p>
The reason I could count on my raincoat to protect me in the mountains,
though, was because, like most expedition-level gear, it is made of
<a href="https://www.gore-tex.com/sustainability/protect-the-planet/reduce-chemical-impacts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
membrane manufactured by Gore-Tex</a>, with an additional DWR
waterproofing finish
<a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/our-dwr-problem/story-17791.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that
also contains PFAS</a>. Gore-Tex is known in the outdoors industry for
making the holy grail of performance fabrics: Its membranes are
waterproof, durable, and breathable enough to exercise in, a challenging
and impressive combination to nail. But to achieve this, the company has
traditionally used the fluoropolymer PTFE,
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/amzn1.dv.gti.c6b73311-9e06-1b77-7872-e437b0923c68?autoplay=0&ref_=atv_cf_strg_wb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
notorious forever chemical</a> you probably know by the trademarked name
Teflon.
</p>
<p>
This technology — or rather, these chemicals — are incredibly and
irresistibly good at what they do. “The terrible truth,”
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-rain-jackets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Wired</em>
wrote</a> in its list of raincoat recommendations updated this past
December, “is that if you’re going to be exposed [to inclement weather]
for multiple hours, you are probably not going to be able to rely on a
[PFAS]-free DWR to keep hypothermia at bay.”
</p>
<p>
When I reached out to Gore-Tex about its use of PFAS, company
spokesperson Julie Evans told me via email that “there are important
distinctions among materials associated with the term PFAS” and that the
fluoropolymers Gore uses, such as PTFE, “are not the same as those
substances that are bioavailable, mobile, and persistent.” She stressed
that “not all PFAS are the same” and that PTFE and the other
fluoropolymers in the Gore arsenal meet the standards of low concern,
and are “extremely stable and do not degrade in the environment,” are
“too large to be bioavailable,” and are “non-toxic [and] safe to use
from an environmental and human perspective.” The National Resource
Defense Council, by contrast,
<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/pfas_scorecard_r_22-04-b_03_locked.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>
that PFAS polymers like PTFE, “when added as a coating or membrane to a
raincoat or other product, can pose a toxic risk to wearers, just as
other PFAS can.”
</p>
<p>
Some of the environmental health advocates I spoke with said Gore-Tex’s
language was misleading. Mike Schade, the director of Toxic-Free
Future’s Mind the Store program, which pressures retailers to avoid
stocking items that use hazardous chemicals, told me that while it is
“laudable that the company has phased some PFAS out of their products …
what we’re concerned about is the entire class. We think it’s misleading
to consumers and to the public to suggest that other PFAS are not of
environmental concern.”
</p>
<p>
Blum, of the Green Science Policy Institute, admitted that while
“probably your Gore-Tex jacket won’t hurt you” — there is
<a href="https://www.outdoorresearch.com/blogs/stories/what-is-pfas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">limited
evidence</a> that PFAS will leech into your body just from wearing it —
there’s a more significant issue at the heart of the PFAS debate. “When
you go from the monomer to the polymer” in the chemical manufacturing
process, she said, it “contaminates the drinking water in the area where
it’s made.” The disposal process — and especially incineration, a common
fate for discarded clothing — is another opportunity for PFAS to shed
into the environment. People who live near landfills and chemical
manufacturing plants in industrial hubs like
<a href="https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/pfas_contamination/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Michigan</a>
and many cities in
<a href="https://apparelresources.com/business-news/sustainability/transforming-bangladesh-manufacturing-hub-meet-bangladesh-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bangladesh</a>
suffer from PFAS at disproportionate levels.
</p>
<p>
So then, where do we go from here? Hikers, skiers, mountaineers,
fly-fishers — they all still need clothing to stay dry. “Our industry is
committed to performance and making sure that the gear that people are
sold can live up to the standards that athletes need,” Steinkamp said.
“I know that is top of mind, and that’s what’s making [the transition]
so hard.”
</p>
<p>
But it also might be the case that our gear is <em>too</em> waterproof.
“When we think about the intended performance of outdoor gear, there’s a
lot of expectation that your gear will keep you extremely dry,” Kaytlin
Moeller, the regional sustainability manager at Fenix Outdoor North
America, the parent company of outdoors brands like Fjällräven and Royal
Robbins, told me. “But when we really start to look at it,” she added,
“I think part of the question is: What is the level of functionality
that is really necessary for the customer to have a positive experience
outdoors and be prepared for their adventure?”
</p>
<p>
It’s probably less than you think; consumers frequently don
Everest-level technologies to walk their dogs for 15 minutes in a
drizzle. “As responsible creators of products, it’s our job to balance
functionality with impact,” Moeller said. “And in terms of [PFAS], it
just wasn’t worth the risk and the carcinogenic qualities to continue
putting that treatment on our products when there are other innovative
coatings and constructions that we can use.”
</p>
<p>
Those alternatives, like innovative fabric weavings and proprietary
waxes, might not sound as high-tech as hydrophobic chemicals. Still, for
the vast majority of regular people — and even most outdoor recreators —
it’s likely more than enough to stay comfortably dry. “We’ve been going
into the outdoors for hundreds and hundreds of years without these
chemicals,” Schade pointed out. “We can do it again.”
</p>
<p>
Luckily for everything and everyone on the planet, new waterproofing
products are getting better by the day. Gore-Tex has spent “the better
part of the last decade” developing its new PFAS-free “ePE membrane,”
Evans told me. Short for expanded polyethylene, ePE is fluorine-free
(albeit,
<a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/gear/gore-tex-epe-membrane" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">derived
from fossil fuels</a>) and has been adopted by Patagonia, Arc’teryx, and
others in the outdoor industry as a PFAS-free alternative. Evans
described it as feeling “a little lighter and softer” than old-school
Gore-Tex, but “with all the same level of performance benefits” as the
historic products.
</p>
<p>
Other companies, including Patagonia, have been
<a href="https://www.patagonia.com/stories/say-goodbye-to-forever-chemicals/story-133800.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transparent</a>
about their phase-out goals and the ongoing difficulties of the
PFAS-free transition; Gin, the Patagonia spokesperson, told me that as
of this fall, “92% of our materials by volume with water-repellent
chemistries are made without” PFAS, and that the new waterproofing
“stands up to the demands of our most technical items.” Deuter, Black
Diamond, Outdoor Research, Jack Wolfskin, Mammut, Marmot, and prAna are
among other outdoor brands that are
<a href="https://pfascentral.org/pfas-free-products/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working
to remove</a> PFAS from their gear.
</p>
<p>
“We have to work together, collaboratively, if we really want to
eliminate them — to the point of the verbiage around being [PFAS]-free,”
Moeller stressed. “No one can be [PFAS]-free ’til everyone in the
industry is, because of the risk of cross-contamination.”
</p>
<p>
Then there are the consumers who will need to adjust. I admit, in the
weeks before beginning the reporting for this article, I bought myself
another raincoat. It was on sale from one of my favorite outdoor brands,
and I was attracted to its aggressively cheerful shade of Morton
Salt-girl yellow, which I thought would also help me stand out in the
case of a future emergency.
</p>
<p>
At the time, I hadn’t even thought to check what it was made of; what
mattered to me was how, when I slipped it on, I became amphibious — like
some kind of marine mammal, slick and impervious to the rain. Stepping
out of my front door and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nyc-flooding-whirlpool-subway-sea-lions" target="_self">into
a downpour</a>, I felt practically invincible.

<h2 id="start-now-dont-wait">Start now, don’t wait</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Start now, don’t wait
</h1>
<p>
If I had young people ask me for advice (which they aren’t and when I
was young I also didn’t) I’d say this: The world is designed to keep you
docile and distracted. If you want to do adventurous things, risk
things, go far, you must do it now. If you wait, you will be too late.
</p>
<p>
Everybody going on adventure everywhere is ill prepared. There fact that
you cannot prepare is what makes it an adventure. Great things were done
by people who were ill prepared.
</p>
<p>
It’s true for sports, for your career, for politics. If you wait until
the time is right, all the people who got started when the time was not
right will have made the decisions for you.
</p>
<p>
The same is true for any kind of change. People like me tell you that
we’ve got this but we don’t – and by the time you realize that everybody
is fumbling and improvising, and when you finally learn how important it
is to network and to be sly, how nobody who gets anything done just
speaks the truth, when you realize that just because you are right
people aren’t going to change their opinions, when you realize that to
make changes you need to be politically active, to organize, even though
you won’t learn how to do this in school because school prepares you for
the world that is, for the system that upholds it, not the better world
that is possible because it isn’t tried and true and nobody is financing
that, then you’ll be as old as me and still won’t have done a thing.
</p>
<p>
Sure, it’s never too late but if you get started early, there’s still
time.
</p>
<p>
And if instead you think, old man, I have done all that and more, what
are you talking about? Then I am relieved and my fears are unfounded.
Thank you!

No, we’re not talking about three of Snow White’s seven dwarfs — we’re
talking about the mood of the American consumer. Despite low levels of
unemployment, solid GDP growth and cooling inflation, Americans remain
pretty darn sour on the economy. What gives? Plus, China is sanctioning
five American defense contractors, and a massive new train line in
Mexico is stirring controversy among environmentalists.

AMD’s Ryzen 8040 “Hawk Point” series mobile processors are very similar
to the company’s previous-gen Ryzen 7040 “Phoenix” series when it comes
to CPU and GPU technology, core counts, and frequencies. The biggest
difference is that the new chips have a neural processing unit that’s
60% faster, enabling better support for on-device AI processing. But […]

<p>I would like to give a LLM a pointer to a folder of my writing and
say “learn this” and then a few hours or days later I’d be able to ask
it questions about what I wrote. I also have folders of stuff my parents
wrote. It would be kind of interesting to feed those into a LLM and then
ask questions about them. Could be the equivalent of ten years of

<em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> Insurance agents and analysts tell the
paper that, rather than face public backlash from officially abandoning
states like Florida or California, carriers are resorting to more subtle
– but equally effective – tactics to “choke off” new business. These
include closing local offices or making it difficult for homeowners to
even get a quote unless they fight through layers of red tape. “Most of
the carriers have just flat out said, we are not accepting new business
right now [in California]. But that statement is made to insurance
agencies, not the public,” says Timothy Gaspar, head of a Los
Angeles-based insurance agency. “Or they’re making it next to impossible
to get a new policy.”

from the <em>Financial Times</em> finds shipowners are resisting growing
pressure to order newer, greener vessels and decarbonize the sector,
opting instead to hold on to older ships. The average age of the global
container shipping fleet is now 14.3 years, and the average age of
tankers is 12.9 years. Why are owners keeping their aging vessels? One
reason is they’re not confident in the availability of new energy
sources like green fuel. Another is the soaring resale value of
second-hand ships, which are being bought up by a “shadow fleet”
transporting Russian oil. The United Nations International Maritime
Organization (IMO) recently set a 2050 net zero target for global
shipping, but no legally binding measures have been set to facilitate
the goal. International shipping

<strong></strong>This week a team of British researchers will embark on
a mission to learn if pumping seawater on top of sea ice can “refreeze”
the Arctic,

the <em>Times</em> of London. As global temperatures rise, sea ice is
rapidly shrinking, decimating habitats for wildlife and exacerbating a
global warming feedback loop: Less ice means more water to absorb the
sun’s energy. The scientists plan to cut a hole in the ice and pump
seawater on top of it, which they hope will freeze, “speeding up the
natural freezing process underneath the ice,” the <em>Times</em>
explains.

There are some big unknowns, one being whether using salty seawater
could actually make the melting worse. Another is whether powering the
project could even be feasible. This particular trial is being powered
by a hydrogen fuel cell, but reversing ice loss trends would require
about 10 million pumps. As one researcher put it: “That’s a lot of
pumps.” This is one of several engineering methods being floated as
potential solutions to the rapidly worsening sea ice problem, the
<em>Times</em> reports. Another wild idea is to sprinkle glass powder on
the ice to reflect the sun’s rays.

Gaming laptops used to be big and heavy machines with large displays and
high-performance internals. But over the past few years we’ve seen a
growing number of companies including Acer, Asus, and Razer show that
it’s possible to make a decent gaming laptop that weighs around 4 pounds
or less. Now HP is getting in […]

year. We’ll check in with Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin about

hope to attract consumer dollars at CES, and California expands state

Interdisciplinary Workshop on Reimagining Democracy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, updated: 2024-01-09, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Last month, I convened the Second Interdisciplinary Workshop on
Reimagining Democracy
(<a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2023/">IWORD 2023</a>) at the
Harvard Kennedy School Ash Center. As with
<a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022/">IWORD 2022</a>, the goal
was to bring together a diverse set of thinkers and practitioners to
talk about how democracy might be reimagined for the twenty-first
century.
</p>
<p>
My thinking is very broad here. Modern democracy was invented in the
mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were
democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies,
it would look very different. Representation would look different.
Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation
would look different. Everything would look different, because we would
have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to
worry about…

Also, trains are starting to run on Mexico’s new multibillion-dollar

more tourists a year to the impoverished Yucatan Peninsula, but critics

Investigators Recover Key Part From Alaska Airlines 737 MAX Jet</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said late
on Sunday the “key missing component” from the Boeing 737 MAX 9 jet
involved in an Alaska Airlines emergency landing had been recovered from
the backyard of a suburban home.</p>
<p>The plug door tore off the left side of an Alaska Airlines jet on
Friday following takeoff from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario,
California, depressurizing the plane and forcing pilots to turn back and
land safely with all 171 passengers and six crew on board.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered the temporary
grounding of 171 Boeing MAX 9 jets installed with the same panel, which
weighs about 27 kg and covers an optional exit door mainly used by
low-cost airlines.</p>
<p>The missing plug door was recovered on Sunday by a Portland school
teacher identified only as “Bob” in the Cedar Hills neighborhood who
found it in his backyard, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said, saying she
was “very relieved” it had been found.</p>
<p>She had earlier told reporters the aircraft part was a “key missing
component” to determine why the accident occurred.</p>
<p>“Our structures team will want to look at everything on the door -
all of the components on the door to see to look at witness marks, to
look at any paint transfer, what shape the door was in when found. That
can tell them a lot about what occurred,” she said.</p>
<p>The force from the loss of the plug door was strong enough to blow
open the cockpit door during flight, said Homendy, who said it must have
been a “terrifying event” to experience.</p>
<p>“They heard a bang,” Homendy said of the pilots, who were interviewed
by investigators.</p>
<p>A quick reference laminated checklist flew out the door, while the
first officer lost her headset, she said. “Communication was a serious
issue… It was described as chaos.”</p>
<p>Homendy said the cockpit voice recorder did not capture any data
because it had been overwritten and again called on regulators to
mandate retrofitting existing planes with recorders that capture 25
hours of data, up from the two hours required at present.</p>
<p>Earlier pressurization issues</p>
<p>Homendy said the auto pressurization fail light illuminated on the
same Alaska Airlines aircraft on Dec. 7, Jan. 3 and Jan. 4, but it was
unclear if there was any connection between those incidents and the
accident.</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines made a decision after the warnings to restrict the
aircraft from making long flights over water to Hawaii so that it could
return quickly to an airport if needed, Homendy said.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based carrier said earlier in response to questions about
the warning lights that aircraft pressurization system write-ups were
typical in commercial aviation operations with large planes.</p>
<p>The airline said, “in every case, the write up was fully evaluated
and resolved per approved maintenance procedures and in full compliance
with all applicable FAA regulations.”</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines added it has an internal policy to restrict aircraft
with multiple maintenance write-ups on some systems from long flights
over water that was not required by the FAA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Planes grounded</p>
<p>The FAA said on Sunday the affected fleet of Boeing MAX 9 planes,
including those operated by other carriers such as United Airlines,
would remain grounded until the regulator was satisfied they were
safe.</p>
<p>The FAA initially said on Saturday the required inspections would
take four to eight hours, leading many in the industry to assume the
planes could very quickly return to service.</p>
<p>But criteria for the checks have yet to be agreed between the FAA and
Boeing, meaning airlines have yet to receive detailed instructions,
people familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>The FAA must approve Boeing’s inspection criteria before the checks
can be completed and planes can resume flights. Alaska Airlines said
late on Sunday it had still not received instructions from Boeing.</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines canceled 170 flights on Sunday and a further 60 on
Monday and said travel disruptions from the grounding were expected to
last through at least midweek. United, which has grounded its 79 MAX 9s,
canceled 230 flights on Sunday, or 8% of scheduled departures.</p>
<p>The accident has put Boeing back under scrutiny as it awaits
certification of its smaller MAX 7 as well as the larger MAX 10, which
is needed to compete with a key Airbus model.</p>
<p>In 2019, global authorities subjected all MAX planes to a wider
grounding that lasted 20 months after crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia
linked to poorly designed cockpit software killed a total of 346
people.</p>

Dominates Golden Globes, ‘Poor Things’ Upsets ‘Barbie’ in Comedy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEVERLY HILLS, California — “Oppenheimer has dominated the Golden
Globe Awards, taking home the night’s top honor. Yorgos Lanthimos’”Poor
Things” has won best comedy or musical at the 81st Golden Globes, an
upset victory over the category favorite, “Barbie.” </p>
<p>Emma Stone also won for her performance in “Poor Things.”</p>
<p>On the television side, “Succession” and “The Bear” are took multiple
honors. Christopher Nolan’s epic American drama “Oppenheimer” picked up
five big awards including best drama film, best director for Nolan, best
actor for Cillian Murphy, best supporting actor for Robert Downey
Jr. and for Ludwig Göransson’s score.</p>
<p>Paul Giamatti and Da’Vine Joy Randolph both won for their
performances in “The Holdovers.”</p>
<p>Christopher Nolan’s blockbuster biopic “Oppenheimer” dominated the
81st Golden Globes, winning five awards including best drama, while
Yorgos Lanthimos’ Frankenstein riff “Poor Things” pulled off an upset
victor over “Barbie” to triumph in the best comedy or musical
category.</p>
<p>If awards season has been building toward a second match-up of
Barbenheimer, this round went to “Oppenheimer.”</p>
<p>The film also won best director for Nolan, best drama actor for
Cillian Murphy, best supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr. and for
Ludwig Göransson’s score.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it was a no-brainer by any stretch of the imagination
to make a three-hour talky movie — R-rated by the way — about one of the
darkest developments in our history,” said producer Emma Thomas
accepting the night’s final award and thanking Universal chief Donna
Langley.</p>
<p>Along with best comedy or musical, “Poor Things” also won for Emma
Stone’s performance as Bella, a Victorian-era woman experiencing a
surreal sexual awakening.</p>
<p>“I see this as a rom-com,” said Stone. “But in the sense that Bella
falls in love with life itself, rather than a person.</p>
<p>She accepts the good and the bad in equal measure, and that really
made me look at life differently.”</p>
<p>Lily Gladstone won best actress in a dramatic film for Martin
Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon.” Gladstone, who began her speech
speaking the language of her native tribe, Blackfeet Nation, is the
first Indigenous winner in the category.</p>
<p>“This is a historic win,” said Gladstone. “It doesn’t just belong to
me.”</p>
<p>The Globes were in their ninth decade but facing a new and uncertain
chapter. After a tumultuous few years of scandal, the Hollywood Foreign
Press Association was dissolved, leaving a new Globes, on a new network
(CBS), to try to regain its perch as the third biggest award show of the
year, after the Oscars and Grammys. Even the menu (sushi from Nobu) was
remade.</p>
<p>“Golden Globes journalists, thank you for changing your game,
therefore changing your name,” said Downey in his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>It got off to a rocky start. Host Jo Koy took the stage at the
Beverly Hilton International Ballroom in Beverly Hills, California.</p>
<p>The Filipino American stand-up hit on some expected topics: Ozempic,
Meryl Streep’s knack for winning awards and the long-running
“Oppenheimer.” (“I needed another hour.”)</p>
<p>After one joke flubbed, Koy, who was named host after some bigger
names reportedly passed, also noted how fast he was thrust into the
job.</p>
<p>“Yo, I got the gig 10 days ago. You want a perfect monologue?” said
Koy. “I wrote some of these and they’re the ones you’re laughing
at.”</p>
<p>Hi, Barbie</p>
<p>Downey’s win, his third Globe, denied one to “Kenergy.” Ryan Gosling
had been seen as his stiffest competition, just one of the many
head-to-head contests between “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s
“Barbie.”</p>
<p>The filmmakers faced each other in the best director category, where
Nolan triumphed.</p>
<p>It was two hours before “Barbie,” the year’s biggest hit with more
than $1.4 billion in ticket sales, won an award Sunday. Billie Eilish’s
“What Was I Made For?” took best song, and swiftly after, “Barbie” took
the Globes’ new honor for “cinematic and box office achievement.”</p>
<p>Some thought that award might go to Taylor Swift, whose “Taylor
Swift: The Eras Tour” also set box-office records. Swift, though,
remains winless in five Globe nods.</p>
<p>Margot Robbie, star and producer of “Barbie,” accepted the award in a
pink gown modeled after 1977’s Superstar Barbie.</p>
<p>“We’d like to dedicate this to every single person on the planet who
dressed up and went to the greatest place on Earth: the movie theaters,”
said Robbie.</p>
<p>“Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” two blockbusters brought together by a
common release date, also faced off in the best screenplay category.</p>
<p>But in an upset, Justine Triet and Arthur Harari won for the script
to the French courtroom drama “Anatomy of a Fall.” Later, Triet’s film
picked up best international film, too.</p>
<p>Though the Globes have no direct correlation with the Academy Awards,
they can boost campaigns at a crucial juncture. Oscar nomination voting
starts Thursday, and the twin sensations of Barbenheimer remain
frontrunners.</p>
<p>Other contenders loom, though, like “Poor Things” and “The
Holdovers.”</p>
<p>Paul Giamatti and Da’Vine Joy Randolph both won for Alexander Payne’s
“The Holdovers.” Giamatti, reuniting with Payne two decades after
“Sideways,” won best actor and Randolph won for her supporting
performance as a grieving woman in the 1970s-set boarding school
drama.</p>
<p>“Oh, Mary you have changed my life,” Randolph said of her character.
“You have made me feel seen in so many ways that I have never
imagined.”</p>
<p>Hayao Miyazaki’s “The Boy and the Heron” won best animated film, an
upset over “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.”</p>
<p>‘Succession,’  ‘The Bear’ Lead TV Winners</p>
<p>The final season of “Succession” cleaned up on the television side.
It won best drama series for the third time, a mark that ties a record
set by “Mad Men” and “The X-Files.” Three stars from the HBO series also
won: Matt Macfadyen, Sarah Snook and Kieran Culkin.</p>
<p>“It is bittersweet, but things like this make it rather sweeter,”
said “Succession” creator Jesse Armstrong.</p>
<p>Hulu’s “The Bear” also came away with a trio of awards, including
best comedy series. Jeremy Allen White won for the second time, but this
time he had company.</p>
<p>Ayo Edebiri won her first Globe for her leading performance in the
Hulu show’s second season. She thanked the assistants of her agents and
managers.</p>
<p>“To the people who answer my emails, you’re the real ones,” said
Edebiri.</p>
<p>“Beef” won three awards: best limited series as well as acting awards
for Ali Wong and Steven Yeun.</p>
<p>The Globes also added a new stand-up special award. That went,
surprisingly, to Ricky Gervais, who didn’t attend the show he so often
hosted. Some expected Chris Rock to win for “Selective Outrage,” his
stand-up response to the Will Smith slap.</p>
<p>The Globes Comeback</p>
<p>A few years ago, the Golden Globes were on the cusp of collapse.
After The Los Angeles Times reported that the HFPA had no Black members,
Hollywood boycotted the organization.</p>
<p>The 2022 Globes were all but canceled and taken off TV. After
reforms, the Globes returned to NBC last year in a one-year deal, but
the show was booted to Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>With Jerrod Carmichael hosting, the telecast attracted 6.3 million
viewers, a new low on NBC and a far cry from the 20 million that once
tuned in.</p>
<p>The Golden Globes were acquired by Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark
Productions, which Penske Media owns, and turned into a for-profit
venture.</p>
<p>The HFPA (which typically numbered around 90 voters) was dissolved
and a group of some 300 entertainment journalists from around the world
now vote for the awards.</p>
<p>Questions still remain about the Globes’ long-term future, but their
value to Hollywood studios remains providing a marketing boost to awards
contenders. (The Oscars won’t be held until March 10.)</p>
<p>This year, because of the actors and writers strikes, the Globes are
airing ahead of the Emmys, which were postponed to Jan. 15.</p>
<p>With movie ticket sales still 20% off the pre-pandemic pace and the
industry facing a potentially perilous 2024 at the box office, Hollywood
needed the Golden Globes as much as it ever has.</p>
<p>The most comical evaluation on the Globes came from presenters Will
Ferrell and Kristin Wiig, who blamed the awards body for the constant
interruption of a song they found irresistible while otherwise solemnly
presenting best actor in a drama.</p>
<p>A furious, dancing Ferrell shouted: “The Golden Globes have not
changed!”</p>

id="first-us-lunar-lander-in-more-than-50-years-rockets-toward-moon-with-commercial-deliveries">First
US Lunar Lander In More Than 50 Years Rockets Toward Moon With
Commercial Deliveries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Cape Canaveral, Florida — The first U.S. lunar lander in more than 50
years rocketed toward the moon Monday, launching private companies on a
space race to make deliveries for NASA and other customers.</p>
<p>Astrobotic Technology’s lander caught a ride on a brand new rocket,
United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan. The Vulcan streaked through the Florida
predawn sky, putting the spacecraft on a roundabout route to the moon
that should culminate with an attempted landing on Feb. 23.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh company aims to be the first private business to
successfully land on the moon, something only four countries have
accomplished. But a Houston company also has a lander ready to fly, and
could beat it to the lunar surface, taking a more direct path.</p>
<p>“First to launch. First to land is TBD” — to be determined, said
Astrobotic chief executive John Thornton.</p>
<p>NASA gave the two companies millions to build and fly their own lunar
landers. The space agency wants the privately owned landers to scope out
the place before astronauts arrive while delivering NASA tech and
science experiments as well as odds and ends for other customers.</p>
<p>Astrobotic’s contract for the Peregrine lander: $108 million.</p>
<p>The last time the U.S. launched a moon-landing mission was in
December 1972.</p>
<p>Apollo 17’s Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt became the 11th and 12th
men to walk on the moon, closing out an era that has remained NASA’s
pinnacle.</p>
<p>The space agency’s new Artemis program — named after the twin sister
of Apollo in Greek mythology — looks to return astronauts to the moon’s
surface within the next few years.</p>
<p>First will be a lunar fly-around with four astronauts, possibly
before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Highlighting Monday’s moonshot was the long-delayed initial test
flight of the Vulcan rocket from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.</p>
<p>The 61-meter rocket is essentially an upgraded version of ULA’s
hugely successful workhorse Atlas V, which is being phased out along
with the company’s Delta IV. Jeff Bezos’ rocket company, Blue Origin,
provided the Vulcan’s two main engines.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and the U.S. racked up a string of successful moon
landings in the 1960s and 70s, before putting touchdowns on pause. China
joined the elite club in 2013 and India in 2023. But last year also saw
landers from Russia and a private Japanese company slam into the moon.
An Israeli nonprofit crashed in 2019.</p>
<p>Next month, SpaceX will provide the lift for a lander from Intuitive
Machines. The Nova-C lander’s more direct one-week route could see both
spacecraft attempting to land within days or even hours of one
another.</p>
<p>The hourlong descent to the lunar surface — by far the biggest
challenge — will be “exciting, nail-biting, terrifying all at once,”
said Thornton.</p>
<p>Besides flying experiments for NASA, Astrobotic drummed up its own
freight business, packing the 1.9-meter-tall Peregrine lander with
everything from a chip of rock from Mount Everest and toy-size cars from
Mexico that will catapult to the lunar surface and cruise around, to the
ashes and DNA of deceased space enthusiasts, including “Star Trek”
creator Gene Roddenberry and science fiction writer Arthur C.
Clarke.</p>
<p>The Navajo Nation recently sought to have the launch delayed because
of the human remains, saying it would be a “profound desecration” of a
celestial body revered by Native Americans.</p>
<p>Thornton said the December objections came too late but promised to
try to find “a good path forward” with the Navajo for future
missions.</p>
<p>One of the spaceflight memorial companies that bought room on the
lander, Celestis, said in a statement that no single culture or religion
owns the moon and should not be able to veto a mission.</p>
<p>More remains are on the rocket’s upper stage, which, once free of the
lander, will indefinitely circle the sun as far out as Mars.</p>
<p>Cargo fares for Peregrine ranged from a few hundred dollars to $1.2
million per kilogram, not nearly enough for Astrobotic to break even.
But for this first flight, that’s not the point, according to
Thornton.</p>
<p>“A lot of people’s dreams and hopes are riding on this,” he said.</p>

id="the-cooperation-between-orf-virus-and-staphylococcus-aureus-leads-to-intractable-lesions-in-skin-infection">The
cooperation between orf virus and Staphylococcus aureus leads to
intractable lesions in skin infection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
A large amount of evidence shows that different kinds of microorganisms
can jointly cope with environmental pressures including cell hosts. For
example, in many cases, it has been found that secondary or mixed
infection of animals caused by ORFV (an epitheliophilic Parapoxvirus)
and bacteria (such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus) shows a
mutual aid mode that indirectly leads to the deterioration of the
disease. However, the lack of research on the co-pathogenic mechanism,
including how to hijack and destroy the cell host in the pathological
microenvironment, has hindered the in-depth understanding of the
pathogenic process and consequences of this complex infection and the
development of clinical treatment methods. Here, we summarized the
current strategies of trapping cell hosts together, based on the
previously defined ORFV-Host (O-H) system. The opportunistic invasion of
<italic>S. aureus</italic> destroyed the delicate dynamic balance of the
O-H, thus aggravating tissue damage through bacterial products (mediated

for functional constipation in children: an overview of overlapping
systematic reviews</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
This overview of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analysis (MAs) aimed
to systematically collate, appraise and synthesize evidence of
probiotics for functional constipation (FC) in children.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
SRs/MAs of probiotics for FC in children were systematic identified by
searching Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and Web of science.
Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation
(GRADE) were unitized by two reviewers independently to assess the
methodological quality, reporting quality, and quality of evidence,
respectively.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Seven SRs/MAs met the eligibility criteria and were included in this
study. According to AMSTAR-2, a very low methodological quality
assessment was given to the included SRs/MAs due to the limitations of
items 2, 4 and 7. For the PRISMA statement, the overall quality of
reporting was unsatisfactory due to the lack of reporting on protocol,
risk of bias across studies, synthesis of results, and additional
analysis. According to GRADE, the quality of evidence for outcomes was
rated as very low to moderate.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Probiotics may be beneficial in improving FC in children. Because of
limitations and inconsistent conclusions, further rigorous, normative
and comprehensive SRs/MAs are needed to provide robust evidence for
definitive conclusions.

id="anti-obesity-effects-by-parasitic-nematode-trichinella-spiralis-total-lysates">Anti-obesity
effects by parasitic nematode (Trichinella spiralis) total lysates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Obesity is an inducible factor for the cause of chronic diseases and is
described by an increase in the size and number of adipocytes that
differentiate from precursor cells (preadipocytes). Parasitic helminths
are the strongest natural trigger of type 2 immune system, and several
studies have showed that helminth infections are inversely correlated
with metabolic syndromes.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methodology/Principal findings
</title>
<p>
To investigate whether helminth-derived molecules have therapeutic
effects on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, we isolated total
lysates from <italic>Trichinella spiralis</italic> muscle larvae. We
then checked the anti-obesity effect after intraperitoneal
administration and intraoral administration of total lysate from
<italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle larvae in a diet-induced obesity
model. <italic>T. spiralis</italic> total lysates protect against
obesity by inhibiting the proinflammatory response and/or enhancing M2
macrophages. In addition, we determined the effects of total lysates
from <italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle larvae on anti-obesity
activities in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by investigating the expression
levels of key adipogenic regulators, including peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding
protein alpha (C/EBPα) and adipocyte protein 2 (aP2). Oil Red O staining
showed that the total lysates from <italic>T. spiralis</italic> muscle
larvae decreased the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes by
decreasing the number of lipid droplets. In addition, the production
levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ and TNF-α were
examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). <italic>T.
spiralis</italic> total lysates decreased intracellular lipid
accumulation and suppressed the expression levels of PPARγ, C/EBPα and
aP2.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion/Significance
</title>
<p>
These results show that <italic>T. spiralis</italic> total lysate
significantly suppresses the symptoms of obesity in a diet- induced
obesity model and 3T3-L1 cell differentiation and suggest that it has
potential for novel anti-obesity therapeutics.

staphylococcal small-colony variants in cardiac implantable electronic
device infections: clinical characteristics, management, and genomic
insights</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Objectives
</title>
<p>
Staphylococcal small-colony variants (SCVs) are common in cardiac
implantable electronic device (CIED) infections. This is the first
retrospective and multi-case study on CIED infections due to
staphylococcal SCVs, aiming to provide a theoretical basis for the
clinical management of CIED and device-related infections caused by
staphylococcal SCVs.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Ninety patients with culture positive CIED infections were enrolled
between 2021 and 2022. We compared the demographic and clinical
characteristics of patients with and without SCVs and performed genomic
studies on SCVs isolates.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Compared to patients without SCVs, those with SCVs had a longer primary
pacemaker implantation time and were more likely to have a history of
device replacement and infection. They showed upregulated inflammatory
indicators, especially higher NEUT% (52.6 vs. 26.8%, <italic>P</italic>
= 0.032) and they had longer hospital stays (median 13 vs. 12 days,
<italic>P</italic> = 0.012). Comparative genomics analysis was performed
on <italic>Staphylococcus epidermidis</italic> wild-type and SCVs. Some
genes were identified, including <italic>aap</italic>, genes encoding
adhesin, CHAP domain-containing protein, LPXTG cell wall anchor
domain-containing protein, and YSIRK-type signal peptide-containing
protein.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
Staphylococcal SCVs affect the clinical characteristics of CIED
infections. The process of staphylococcal SCVs adherence, biofilm
formation, and interaction with neutrophils play a vital role.

bacteria from the human microbiota</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Antiretroviral therapy has improved life expectancy in HIV-infected
patients. However, people living with HIV under antiretroviral therapy
are at higher risks of developing chronic complications and acquiring
multidrug resistant bacteria than healthy population. These factors have
been associated with shifts in gut microbiome composition and immune
activation. It is unclear how antiretroviral drugs affect gut microbiota
composition, but it has been observed that antiretroviral treatment is
not able to fully restore gut health after HIV infection. Additionally,
some antiretroviral drugs have shown antibacterial activity suggesting
that these drugs could have a direct impact on the human microbiome
composition.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We determined the <italic>in vitro</italic> antibacterial activity of 16
antiretroviral drugs against a set of key clinically relevant and human
commensal bacterial strains.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our results demonstrate that 5 antiretroviral drugs have <italic>in
vitro</italic> antibacterial activity against gut and vaginal human
commensal bacteria. Zidovudine has antibacterial activity against
<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella
pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Prevotella bivia</italic>, abacavir
against <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, efavirenz against
<italic>G. vaginalis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic> and
bictegravir against <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and <italic>G.
vaginalis</italic>. Moreover, we describe for the first time that
elvitegravir has antibacterial activity against <italic>G.
vaginalis</italic> and <italic>P. bivia</italic> and, most importantly,
against vancomycin-resistant <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp. and
methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> strains
with MIC values of 4-16 and 4 µg/mL, respectively showing high level of
effectiveness against the tested multidrug-resistant bacteria.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Our results underscore that some antiretroviral drugs may influence the
human microbiota composition. In addition, we report the potential use
of elvitegravir to treat multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria
warranting the need of clinical studies to repurpose this antiretroviral
drug.

blue light-emitting diode exposure harvests gut dysbiosis related to
cholesterol dysregulation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Night shift workers have been associated with circadian dysregulation
and metabolic disorders, which are tightly coevolved with gut
microbiota. The chronic impacts of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting
at night on gut microbiota and serum lipids were investigated. Male
C57BL/6 mice were exposed to blue or white LED lighting at Zeitgeber
time 13.5-14 (ZT; ZT0 is the onset of “lights on” and ZT12 is the
“lights off” onset under 12-hour light, 12-hour dark schedule). After 33
weeks, only the high irradiance (7.2 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of blue LED light
reduced the alpha diversity of gut microbiota. The high irradiance of
white LED light and the low irradiance (3.6 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) of both
lights did not change microbial alpha diversity. However, the low
irradiance, but not the high one, of both blue and white LED
illuminations significantly increased serum total cholesterol (TCHO),
but not triglyceride (TG). There was no significant difference of
microbial abundance between two lights. The ratio of beneficial to
harmful bacteria decreased at a low irradiance but increased at a high
irradiance of blue light. Notably, this ratio was negatively correlated
with serum TCHO but positively correlated with bile acid biosynthesis
pathway. Therefore, chronic blue LED lighting at a high irradiance may
harvest gut dysbiosis in association with decreased alpha diversity and
the ratio of beneficial to harmful bacteria to specifically dysregulates
TCHO metabolism in mice. Night shift workers are recommended to be avoid
of blue LED lighting for a long and lasting time.

detection of Seneca Valley virus by one-tube RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a
assay</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Senecavirus A (SVA) is a highly contagious virus that causes vesicular
disease in pigs. At present, laboratory detection methods, such as virus
isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), required precision
instruments and qualified personnel, making them unsuitable for
point-of-care tests (POCT). Fortunately, the emergence of CRISPR/Cas
system has provided new opportunities for fast and efficient pathogen
detection.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
This study successfully developed a precise and sensitive detection
platform for diagnosing SVA by combining the CRISPR system with
recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The minimum detection limit of the assay was 10 copies of the SVA
genome. Meanwhile, the assay demonstrated high specificity. To validate
the effectiveness of this system, we tested 85 swine clinical samples
and found that the fluorescence method had a 100% coincidence rate
compared to RT-qPCR.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Overall, the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay established in our study is a
highly effective method for detecting SVA and holds great potential for
practical applications in the resource-limited settings.

regulating liver activity and its potential effects on liver fibrosis
and Echinococcosis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Ghrelin widely exists in the central nervous system and peripheral
organs, and has biological activities such as maintaining energy
homeostasis, regulating lipid metabolism, cell proliferation, immune
response, gastrointestinal physiological activities, cognition, memory,
circadian rhythm and reward effects. In many benign liver diseases, it
may play a hepatoprotective role against steatosis, chronic
inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, endoplasmic
reticulum stress and apoptosis, and improve liver cell autophagy and
immune response to improve disease progression. However, the role of
Ghrelin in liver <italic>Echinococcosis</italic> is currently unclear.
This review systematically summarizes the molecular mechanisms by which
Ghrelin regulates liver growth metabolism, immune-inflammation,
fibrogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis, as well as its protective
effects in liver fibrosis diseases, and further proposes the role of
Ghrelin in liver <italic>Echinococcosis</italic> infection. During the
infectious process, it may promote the parasitism and survival of
parasites on the host by improving the immune-inflammatory
microenvironment and fibrosis state, thereby accelerating disease
progression. However, there is currently a lack of targeted <italic>in
vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental evidence for
this viewpoint.

<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a highly dangerous virus that is globally
prevalent and closely linked to the development of nasopharyngeal cancer
(NPC). Plasma EBV DNA analysis is an effective strategy for early
detection, prognostication and monitoring of treatment response of NPC.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Here, we present a novel molecular diagnostic technique termed
EBV-MCDA-LFB, which integrates multiple cross displacement amplification
(MCDA) with nanoparticle-based lateral flow (LFB) to enable simple,
rapid and specific detection of EBV. In the EBV-MCDA-LFB system, a set
of 10 primers was designed for rapidly amplifying the highly conserved
tandem repeat BamHI-W region of the EBV genome. Subsequently, the LFB
facilitate direct assay reading, eliminating the use of extra
instruments and reagents.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The outcomes showed that the 65°C within 40 minutes was the optimal
reaction setting for the EBV-MCDA system. The sensitivity of
EBV-MCDA-LFB assay reached 7 copies per reaction when using EBV
recombinant plasmid, and it showed 100% specificity without any
cross-reactivity with other pathogens. The feasibility of the
EBV-MCDA-LFB method for EBV detection was successfully validated by 49
clinical plasma samples. The complete detection process, consisting of
rapid template extraction (15 minutes), MCDA reaction (65°C for 40
minutes), and LFB result reading (2 minutes), can be finalized within a
60-minutes duration.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
EBV-MCDA-LFB assay designed here is a fast, extremely sensitive and
specific technique for detecting EBV in field and at the point-of-care
(PoC), which is especially beneficial for countries and regions with a
high prevalence of the disease and limited economic resources.

critical role of neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions in sepsis: new
synergistic approaches employing organ-on-chip, omics, immune cell
phenotyping and in silico modeling to identify new therapeutics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-08, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection
Microbiology</p>
<p>
Sepsis is a global health concern accounting for more than 1 in 5 deaths
worldwide. Sepsis is now defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction
caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can develop
from bacterial (gram negative or gram positive), fungal or viral (such
as COVID) infections. However, therapeutics developed in animal models
and traditional <italic>in vitro</italic> sepsis models have had little
success in clinical trials, as these models have failed to fully
replicate the underlying pathophysiology and heterogeneity of the
disease. The current understanding is that the host response to sepsis
is highly diverse among patients, and this heterogeneity impacts immune
function and response to infection. Phenotyping immune function and
classifying sepsis patients into specific endotypes is needed to develop
a personalized treatment approach. Neutrophil-endothelium interactions
play a critical role in sepsis progression, and increased neutrophil
influx and endothelial barrier disruption have important roles in the
early course of organ damage. Understanding the mechanism of
neutrophil-endothelium interactions and how immune function impacts this
interaction can help us better manage the disease and lead to the
discovery of new diagnostic and prognosis tools for effective
treatments. In this review, we will discuss the latest research
exploring how <italic>in silico</italic> modeling of a synergistic
combination of new organ-on-chip models incorporating human
cells/tissue, omics analysis and clinical data from sepsis patients will
allow us to identify relevant signaling pathways and characterize
specific immune phenotypes in patients. Emerging technologies such as
machine learning can then be leveraged to identify druggable therapeutic
targets and relate them to immune phenotypes and underlying infectious
agents. This synergistic approach can lead to the development of new
therapeutics and the identification of FDA approved drugs that can be
repurposed for the treatment of sepsis.
