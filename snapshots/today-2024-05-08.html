<h2 id="us-revokes-some-licenses-for-exports-to-chinas-huawei">US
revokes some licenses for exports to China’s Huawei</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States has revoked certain licenses for
exports to Chinese tech giant Huawei, the Commerce Department said,
drawing opposition from Beijing on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The move came after criticism last month by Republican lawmakers, who
urged President Joe Biden’s administration to block all export licenses
to the company after it released a new laptop powered by a processor by
U..S chip giant Intel.</p>
<p>“We continuously assess how our controls can best protect our
national security and foreign policy interests, taking into
consideration a constantly changing threat environment and technological
landscape,” said a Commerce Department spokesperson.</p>
<p>“We are not commenting on any specific licenses, but we can confirm
that we have revoked certain licenses for exports to Huawei,” the
spokesperson added in a statement to AFP.</p>
<p>Huawei has long been caught in an intense technological rivalry
between Beijing and Washington, which has warned that the firm’s
equipment could be used for Chinese espionage operations.</p>
<p>The company denies these claims.</p>
<p>Sanctions in 2019 restricting Huawei’s access to U.S.-made components
dealt a major blow to its production of smartphones – and meant that
suppliers need a license before shipping to the company.</p>
<p>Asked about reports that the U.S. government had revoked some
companies’ licenses, a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said
Beijing “firmly opposes this.”</p>
<p>“China will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard the
legitimate rights and interests of Chinese firms,” the spokesperson
added.</p>
<p>The announcement of a new Huawei computer recently, powered by Intel
technology, drew fire from Republican lawmakers in the United
States. </p>
<p>A letter by policymakers Marco Rubio and Elise Stefanik charged that
“licenses issued in 2020, at least some of which are active to this day,
have allowed Huawei to collaborate with Intel and Qualcomm to keep its
PC and smartphone segments alive.”</p>
<p>It criticized the allowance of US tech into Huawei’s new product.</p>

Newest Direct Air Capture Plant Is Officially Live</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE4NzI1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzEzNzU5Mn0.KURqCKn_VckgPJj2c7q6PGrDqAgAurntYDNkdVendLU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
If one company has set the pace for direct air capture, it’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climeworks-orca-data-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture" target="_self">Climeworks</a>.
The Switzerland-based business opened its — and the world’s — first
commercial DAC plant in 2017, capable of capturing “several hundred
tons” of carbon dioxide each year. Today, the company unveils its newest
plant, the aptly named Mammoth. Located in Iceland, Mammoth is designed
to take advantage of the country’s unique geology to capture and store
up to 36,000 tons of carbon per year — eventually. Here’s what you need
to know about the new project.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Mammoth is, well, huge
</h3>
<p>
Mammoth is not yet operating at full capacity, with only 12 of its
planned 72 capturing and filtering units installed. When the plant is
fully operational — which could be late this year or next — it will pull
up to 36,000 tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere annually. For scale,
that’s about 1/28,000th of a gigaton. To get to net zero emissions,
we’ll have to remove
<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/carbon-removals-how-to-scale-a-new-gigaton-industry" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>multiple</em></em></u><u>
gigatons</u></a> of carbon from the atmosphere every year.
</p>
<p>
In the context of where we need to go, in other words, Mammoth is almost
nothing. But in the context of our current reality, it’s nine times the
size of the next largest DAC facility: another Iceland-based Climeworks
plant called Orca. And it’s a major stepping stone towards the company’s
ultimate goal of capturing a million tons of CO2 yearly by 2030 and a
billion by 2050.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Construction happened quickly
</h3>
<p>
Climeworks first broke ground on Mammoth in June 2022, and 18 months
later the company announced that the “core pieces of the plant are
built.” Now that the plant has started capturing CO2, Climeworks says
the rest of 2024 will be devoted to installing the remaining CO2capture
units and ramping toward full capacity.
</p>
<p>
Thus far in its history, Climeworks has largely avoided the construction
delays that often plague first-of-its-kind projects. “They’re coming out
with new projects every three to four years, which is a pretty wild
timeline,” Erin Burns, executive director of the nonprofit Carbon180,
told me.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>It runs on 100% zero-emission power
</h3>
<p>
Through Climework’s partnership with Icelandic geothermal company ON
Power, Mammoth is powered in full by geothermal energy — although the
company has long been reticent about how much energy, exactly, it needs.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, Climeworks has committed to powering the direct air capture
process as well as its storage process with 100% renewables in the long
run.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Climeworks has sold about a third of Mammoth’s lifetime capacity
</h3>
<p>
Though the company hasn’t divulged Mammoth’s lifetime carbon removal
capacity, a representative did tell me that a third has already been
sold. Climeworks works with more than 160 organizations and has
long-term offtake agreements with some major corporate buyers, including
<a href="https://climeworks.com/press-release/jp-morgan-chase-signs-landmark-cdr-agreement-with-climeworks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>JPMorgan
Chase</u></a>,
<a href="https://climeworks.com/press-release/bcg-and-climeworks-sign-15-year-partnership-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Boston
Consulting Group</u></a> and
<a href="https://climeworks.com/press-release/climeworks-extends-collaboration-with-microsoft" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Microsoft</u></a>.
Some of these agreements span a decade or more and involve tens of
thousands of tons of CO2 removal from current and future Climeworks
projects. (The company also recently opened a marketplace,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/climeworks-solutions-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>Climeworks
Solutions</u></a>, to package and sell “high quality” carbon credits
from other DAC companies.)
</p>
<p>
Mammoth should help drive more investment, Dana Jacobs, chief of staff
at the Carbon Removal Alliance, told me. “Having carbon removal projects
that you can see and reach out and touch and understand is so critical,”
she said.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Mammoth is small potatoes compared to what’s next
</h3>
<p>
Climeworks says that the lessons from its Mammoth project will help the
company scale further as it enters the U.S. market through its
participation in the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/regional-direct-air-capture-hubs-selected-and-awarded-projects" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Department
of Energy-funded</u></a> direct air capture hub,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self"><u>Project
Cypress in Louisiana</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Climeworks is working on Project Cypress alongside developer Battelle
and another direct air capture company, Heirloom. The project is
designed to capture a <em><em>million</em></em> tons of CO2annually by
2030, and recently received an
<a href="https://climeworks.com/news/project-cypress-team-awarded-funding-from-us-doe" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>initial
$50 million grant</u></a> from the DOE to kickstart the project’s
planning, design and community engagement processes.

batter Midwest, including reported tornadoes that shredded FedEx
facility</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DETROIT — Severe storms barreled through the Midwest early Wednesday,
a day after two reported tornadoes struck one Michigan city and
destroyed homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx
facility. </p>
<p>Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of
Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and
Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National
Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped
through an Oklahoma town. </p>
<p>As the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National
Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio
could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a
tornado warning. </p>
<p>Hancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday
because of “extensive overnight weather issues” in the county. News
outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages. </p>
<p>Hours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes
blitzed the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying
homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was
ripped apart. </p>
<p>No serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials
said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than
20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday,
city officials said. </p>
<p>At one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility
because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis
said late Tuesday that “all team members are safe and accounted
for.” </p>
<p>More than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early
Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to
PowerOutage.us. </p>
<p>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four
counties. </p>
<p>“My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight’s severe weather
in southwest Michigan,” Whitmer said in a message on social media.
“State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together
to assist Michiganders.” </p>
<p>National Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm
damage in several counties in Michigan’s southwest Lower Peninsula to
determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the
two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist
Mike Sutton with the weather service’s Grand Rapids office. </p>
<p>He said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of
tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from
late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday,
it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns. </p>
<p>Sutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are
completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be
duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm. </p>
<p>“It’s quite possible those are multiple reports from the same
tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what
they find when they’re out surveying,” he said. </p>
<p>Tuesday’s storms came a day after parts of the central United States
were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the
Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring. </p>
<p>Across the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and
the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the
rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville,
St. Louis and Cincinnati — cities where more than 21 million people
live. It should be clear over the weekend. </p>
<p>Oklahoma’s recent twisters</p>
<p>On Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the
1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed. and
another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed. </p>
<p>Aerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with
roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and
stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre
(65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained
heavy damage. </p>
<p>It was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks — a twister
on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph)
damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles. </p>
<p>At the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered
two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation,
twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and
vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out
windows. </p>
<p>Hotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to
wait out the storm. </p>
<p>“When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,” he said. </p>
<p>Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister’s damage Tuesday,
said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds
reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders
have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year’s budget to help
storm-damaged communities. </p>
<p>Areas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still
recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without
power late last month.</p>

<p>
A new report from an independent law firm says that big changes are
needed at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to address
widespread allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination and that
FDIC’s management’s response has been “insufficient.” We’ll discuss.
Plus, there was a big slowdown of consumer credit growth in March. And
can the “Las Vegas of the East” move away from gambling revenue to
entertainment?

I’ve spent countless hours here at <em>Electrek</em> doing detailed
<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/01/11/radtrike-review-testing-rad-power-bikes-electric-trike/">hands-on
testing</a> of hundreds of electric bikes. Through thousands of miles of
riding, I’ve learned these e-bikes inside and out, top to bottom and
front to back. That dedication to real-world e-bike testing has helped
me find the best electric bicycles on the market for just about any
budget.
</p>
<p>
Below are some of the top e-bikes I’ve hand-tested for every price
range, current as of May 2024. Spring is finally upon us (at least, here
in the Northern Hemisphere) and riding season is gearing up! Just like
the<a href="https://electrek.co/2023/11/19/now-is-the-best-time-ever-to-buy-electric-bike/">

<p>NetBSD 10 and NetBSD 9.4 were only recently released, leaving one
final branch to receive what will be its last update: NetBSD 8.3. NetBSD
8.0 was originally released in 2018, so this final release marks six
years of updates, which is a good track record, especially now that two
newer main releases are available to choose from. With 8.3 being the
final release, this means no more regular or security updates, pkgsrc no
longer supports the 8.0 branch either – so yeah, time to upgrade. NetBSD
8.3 brings various updates and bug fixes for libX11, xterm, tmux, and
httpd, and the root name servers and time zone data have been updated to
their latest iterations as well. There’s of course a full list of
changes to peruse through if you want to know every little detail that’s
changed. You can update your installation in-place, of course, or
download the installation media for 8.3 from one of the many
mirrors.</p>

appeals court agrees to review ruling allowing Fani Willis to stay on
Trump election case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA — A Georgia appeals court on Wednesday agreed to review a
lower court ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis
to continue to prosecute the election interference case she brought
against former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump and some other defendants in the case had tried to get Willis
and her office removed from the case, saying her romantic relationship
with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest.
Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of
interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a
request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his
ruling from the Georgia Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>That intermediate appeals court agreed on Wednesday to take up the
case. Once it rules, the losing side could ask the Georgia Supreme Court
to consider an appeal.</p>
<p>The appeals court’s decision to consider the case seems likely to
cause a delay in a case and further reduce the possibility that it will
get to trial before the November general election, when Trump is
expected to be the Republican nominee for president.</p>
<p>In his order, McAfee said he planned to continue to address other
pretrial motions “regardless of whether the petition is granted … and
even if any subsequent appeal is expedited by the appellate court.” But
Trump and the others could ask the Court of Appeals to stay the case
while the appeal is pending.</p>

Electricity Review from climate think tank Ember</a> is positively
brimming with encouraging data about the growth of renewables. The
topline takeaway? Rapid expansion of wind and solar projects in 2023
likely brought the peak in global power sector emissions, and a “new era
of falling fossil fuel generation is imminent.” Key findings and
projections:

<li>
Renewables – mainly solar and wind – provided <strong>more than 30% of
the world’s electricity </strong>last year for the first time.

any electricity source in history</strong>. (A separate

out yesterday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration found that
renewables – especially solar – will cover most of the nation’s
electricity growth this year.)
</li>
<li>
<span></span>More than half of last year’s additions to solar and wind
capacity were <strong>in China</strong>.
</li>
<li>
<span></span>Hydropower fell due to drought, boosting coal generation.
Had this not been the case, emissions from the power sector
<strong>would already have peaked. </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong></strong><strong>EVs, heat pumps, electrolysers, air
conditioning, and data centers</strong> are key drivers of electricity
demand growth.
</li>
<li>
<span></span>Power sector <strong>emissions are expected to fall in
2024.</strong> Clean energy growth is forecast to easily cover the
expected rise in electricity demand in 2024.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<span></span>“The renewables future has arrived,” said Dave Jones,
Ember’s director of global insights. “Solar, in particular, is
accelerating faster than anyone thought possible. The decline of power
sector emissions is now inevitable. 2023 was likely the pivot point –
peak emissions in the power sector – a major turning point in the
history of energy.” But… clean electricity growth has to continue to
speed up if we are to meet the COP28 goal of tripling renewables by 2030
to 60% of global supply. In the immortal words of Jeff Goldblum,
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY8P--R9L4Y&ab_channel=LoveMovieQuotes" target="_blank">must

id="us-paused-bomb-shipment-to-israel-to-signal-concerns-over-rafah-invasion-official-says">US
paused bomb shipment to Israel to signal concerns over Rafah invasion,
official says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week
over concerns that Israel was approaching a decision on launching a
full-scale assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah against the wishes
of the U.S., a senior administration official said Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The shipment was supposed to consist of 1,800 2,000-pound
(900-kilogram) bombs and 1,700 500-pound (225-kilogram) bombs, according
to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the
sensitive matter, with the focus of U.S. concern being the larger
explosives and how they could be used in a dense urban setting. More
than 1 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah after evacuating other
parts of Gaza amid Israel’s war on Hamas, which came after the militant
group’s deadly attack on Israel on Oct. 7. </p>
<p>The U.S. has historically provided enormous amounts of military aid
for Israel. That has only accelerated in the aftermath of Hamas’ Oct. 7
attack that killed some 1,200 in Israel and led to about 250 being taken
captive by militants. The pausing of the aid shipment is the most
striking manifestation of the growing daylight between Israel Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and the administration of
President Joe Biden, which has called on Israel to do far more to
protect the lives of innocent civilians in Gaza. </p>
<p>It also comes as the Biden administration is due to deliver a
first-of-its-kind formal verdict this week on whether the airstrikes on
Gaza and restrictions on delivery of aid have violated international and
U.S. laws designed to spare civilians from the worst horrors of war. A
decision against Israel would further add to pressure on Biden to curb
the flow of weapons and money to Israel’s military. </p>
<p>Biden’s administration in April began reviewing future transfers of
military assistance as Netanyahu’s government appeared to move closer
toward an invasion of Rafah, despite months of opposition from the White
House. The official said the decision to pause the shipment was made
last week and no final decision had been made yet on whether to proceed
with the shipment at a later date. </p>
<p>U.S. officials had declined for days to comment on the halted
transfer, word of which came as Biden on Tuesday described U.S. support
for Israel as “ironclad, even when we disagree.” </p>
<p>Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to square the arms holdup
with Biden’s rhetoric in support of Israel, saying only, “Two things
could be true.” </p>
<p>Israeli troops on Tuesday seized control of Gaza’s vital Rafah border
crossing in what the White House described as a limited operation that
stopped short of the full-on Israeli invasion of the city that Biden has
repeatedly warned against on humanitarian grounds, most recently in a
Monday call with Netanyahu. </p>
<p>Israel has ordered the evacuation of 100,000 Palestinians from the
city. Israeli forces have also carried out what it describes as
“targeted strikes” on the eastern part of Rafah and captured the Rafah
crossing, a critical conduit for the flow of humanitarian aid along the
Gaza-Egypt border. </p>
<p>Privately, concern has mounted inside the White House about what’s
unfolding in Rafah, but publicly administration officials have stressed
that they did not think the operations had defied Biden’s warnings
against a widescale operation in the city. </p>
<p>White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said
Israel described the operation along the Gaza-Egypt border in eastern
Rafah as “an operation of limited scale and duration” aimed at cutting
off Hamas arms smuggling, but also said the U.S. would monitor the
fighting.  </p>
<p>Just last month, Congress passed a $95 billion national security bill
that included funding for Ukraine, Israel and other allies. The package
included more than $14 billion in military aid for Israel, though the
stalled transfer was not related to that measure. </p>
<p>The State Department is separately considering whether to approve the
continued transfer of Joint Direct Attack Munition kits, which place
precision guidance systems onto bombs, to Israel, but the review didn’t
pertain to imminent shipments. </p>
<p>The U.S. dropped the 2,000-pound bomb sparingly in its long war
against the Islamic State militant group. Israel, by contrast, has used
the bomb frequently in the seven-month Gaza war. Experts say the use of
the weapon, in part, has helped drive the enormous Palestinian casualty
count that the Hamas-run health ministry puts at more than 34,000 dead,
though it doesn’t distinguish between militants and civilians. </p>
<p>The U.S.-Israel relationship has been close through both Democratic
and Republican administrations. But there have been other moments of
deep tension since the founding in which U.S. leaders have threatened to
hold up aid in attempt to sway Israeli leadership. </p>
<p>President Dwight Eisenhower pressured Israel with the threat of
sanctions into withdrawing from the Sinai in 1957 in the midst of the
Suez Crisis. Ronald Reagan delayed the delivery of F16 fighter jets to
Israel at a time of escalating violence in the Middle East. President
George H.W. Bush held up $10 billion in loan guarantees to force the
cessation of Israeli settlement activity in the occupied
territories.</p>

willingness to engage Pyongyang exposes a rare rift with Seoul</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration’s apparent willingness to
engage North Korea is causing a rare public rift with one of
Washington’s key allies in Asia over how to achieve Pyongyang’s
denuclearization.</p>
<p>Last week, the two allies, on separate occasions, showed differences
about whether to consider “interim steps” toward North Korea’s complete
denuclearization.</p>
<p>South Korean national security adviser Chang Ho-jin said, “U.S.
senior officials confirmed several times that there are no such thing as
interim steps” toward denuclearization. He made the remarks in an
interview with South Korean media outlet KBS, aired on April 27.</p>
<p>A U.S. National Security Council spokesperson confirmed in an email
to VOA’s Korean Service on April 30 that “by saying that the United
States is willing to consider interim steps, we are making clear that we
recognize that building trust with the DPRK and making progress toward
denuclearization will take time.”</p>
<p>The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) is North Korea’s
official name.</p>
<p>In response to the NSC spokesperson’s comments, a South Korean
Foreign Ministry spokesperson told VOA Korean on May 1 that Chang’s
remarks “reaffirm that the U.S. will not put aside complete
denuclearization while it settles for a stopgap measure limiting
[negotiations] to a nuclear freeze in return for sanctions relief.”</p>
<p>Taking interim steps toward denuclearization involves reciprocal
concessions or corresponding measures that both sides are willing to
make to reach that goal.</p>
<p>Interim steps toward denuclearization are not a new approach. The
approach was tried and failed by the former Clinton and George W. Bush
administrations when North Korea was engaged in negotiations with the
U.S.</p>
<p>In March of this year, senior U.S. officials expressed Washington’s
interest in considering “interim steps” amid talks that remained stalled
with Pyongyang since October 2019.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson told VOA Korean in April that it made
multiple attempts to communicate with North Korean officials, but that
Pyongyang has not shown interest in engaging.</p>
<p>Experts said Seoul is concerned that Washington’s mention of interim
steps and measures that could be included in those steps, especially
threat reduction, could hinder Pyongyang from making a commitment toward
complete denuclearization in future negotiations.</p>
<p>Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation chair in Korea Studies at
Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies, said, “Seoul
prefers not to engage in any diplomatic negotiations without a DPRK
commitment to denuclearization and wants to appear resolute.”</p>
<p>“Washington has signaled to North Korea that it’s willing to be more
flexible when it comes to restarting diplomatic engagement with North
Korea. Seoul may not want to give the appearance of that flexibility so
is perhaps denying any legitimacy behind an ‘interim steps’ approach,”
he added.</p>
<p>Seoul has taken a tough stance on North Korea under President Yoon
Suk Yeol since he took office two years ago by focusing on deterrence
and alignment with Washington and U.S.-led trilateral security
cooperation with Japan.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, a State Department official with extensive experience
negotiating with North Korea, said some critics and officials in Seoul
and Tokyo are worried that the U.S. will focus on other goals Washington
mentioned such as confidence building and tension reduction rather than
on denuclearization.</p>
<p>“There is also concern that Washington may be prepared to engage in
arms control talks with Pyongyang — a move that would generate deep
concern among U.S. allies, in large part because it would effectively
accept North Korea’s nuclear arsenal as permanent,” he said.</p>
<p>Talks over arms control or “nuclear freeze” that Seoul said it is
concerned about or “threat reduction” or “risk reduction” mentioned by
U.S. officials in March — which could be included in the interim steps —
are considered equivalent to accepting North Korea as a nuclear state
and opposed by some officials and analysts.</p>
<p>At an event held by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) on March 3, Mira Rapp-Hooper, senior director for East
Asia and Oceania at the National Security Council, said the U.S. will
discuss threat reduction with North Korea as it considers interim steps
on the “pathway to denuclearization.”</p>
<p>Also at an event by CSIS on March 18, Jung Pak, a U.S. senior
official for North Korea, said Washington wants North Korea to take risk
reduction steps and discuss sanctions and confidence-building measures.
 </p>
<p>Victor Cha, senior vice president for Asia and Korea chair at CSIS,
however, said that Rapp-Hooper’s reference to “the formulation of
interim measures to reduce the threat on the peninsula” in March
“reflects the same pragmatic view that any negotiation has to start at
step 1 — whether you call that interim measures or initial
denuclearization.”</p>
<p>“As a former negotiator, I can say that any pragmatic implementation
of denuclearization would have to include such steps, which I do not
think would represent de facto acceptance of DPRK nuclear status — that
is neither Washington, nor Seoul’s policy,” he said.</p>
<p>Cha formerly served as deputy head of delegation for the U.S. at
six-party denuclearization talks.</p>

Putting the EV Transition in Peril</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE4Njg5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MTQ3OTM0M30.Sl_xbOpUFljDe0tLd4sZ-IL0WPIh6tXzpEWD4_VX8Vw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Tesla is now facing its worst crisis in years. Last week, CEO Elon Musk
laid off the automaker’s roughly 500-person Supercharger team and what
remained of its policy and new vehicle teams. Before that, it reported
its first-quarter financial results — and they were even worse than the
lackluster performance that investors were expecting.
</p>
<p>
Already this year, Tesla has cut around 10% of its employees. Now Musk
is promising that it will shift toward becoming an “AI” company. And on
Wednesday — after we recorded this episode — Reuters
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/shift-key-episode-15-tesla-elon-musk" target="_blank">reported</a>
that the Justice Department is investigating Tesla for lying about its
so-called Full Self Driving software to investors.
</p>
<p>
Does Tesla, long a stalwart of America’s EV transition, now pose a
danger to it? On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse discuss
the automaker’s turn away from EVs, and why Musk’s decision to lay off
the Supercharger team could throw the entire country’s EV transition off
track. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive
editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems
engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> I just want to note one thing you said
there, which is the role of the [National Electric Vehicle
Infrastructure] funding. So the government funding here required that
any recipient of the federal infrastructure funding would be open to
multiple automakers’ vehicles. So you could not, Tesla could not have
kept its network closed and received any of the federal money.<br/>
<br/> And so it is interesting to think like, you know: If NEVI hadn’t
existed, I’m not sure if Tesla would have made that pivot. So it’s
interesting, this is an example of where government funding and
requirements can really open up standards and, you know, kind of force
change. So maybe it was they thought they had to do it in order to stay
competitive, to get a chunk of that federal infrastructure funding. And
maybe they would have been better off if they just kept a closed network
and ignored the shiny pot of money that the federal government was out
there … it’s hard to say, at this point. <br/> <br/> <strong>Robinson
Meyer:</strong> There’s a second aspect of this, though, that I think is
also confusing, which is basically that if Tesla — over the next year,
every American who drives an electric vehicle is going to encounter a
Tesla Supercharger for the first time, whether or not they own a Tesla,
right? Because they’re, the vehicle they own is going to be integrated
into the Tesla network and they’re going to be able to charge.<br/>
<br/> That is such a sales opportunity for Tesla. Tesla needed to nail
that integration, first of all, and execution, because these are not
hard customers to convince to buy a Tesla. These are customers who
already own an electric vehicle. And so if they’re coming to your
Supercharger network, and they’re like, ‘This is an amazing network.
This, like, works so much better than any other network. This works
better than the chargers that my automaker wants to direct me to that
aren’t Tesla, whether they be Electrify America or something else,’ that
would have been an incredible marketing and sales opportunity for Tesla
to convert drivers who already had chosen to go electric. <br/> <br/>
There’s not a better market out there. There’s not a more accessible
market out there for them than people who already drive an EV and are
thinking about their next EV purchase. And so it has now, if nothing
else, guaranteed that the next year will feel chaotic. Maybe, through
some miracle, the Supercharger network keeps working, and it keeps
working pretty well. How they’re going to manage that with no remaining
team, I don’t really understand — but let’s say it keeps working pretty
well. They’ve really fumbled an opportunity to make Tesla seem like the
easiest and most secure and most reliable, you know, value proposition
out there for drivers. <br/> <br/> And I think that’s just … that’s
happened now. That’s water under the bridge. They’ve really screwed this
up, no matter what else happens over the next year. <span></span>

<h2 id="us-inquiry-finds-widespread-sexual-misconduct-at-fdic">US
inquiry finds widespread sexual misconduct at FDIC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation must make
sweeping changes to address widespread sexual harassment and other
misconduct, according to an independent report released on Tuesday that
raises questions about the future of the banking regulator’s
leadership.</p>
<p>The report, prompted by a Wall Street Journal investigation, cited
accounts from more than 500 people, including some who alleged FDIC
Chair Martin Gruenberg had engaged in bullying and verbal abuse.</p>
<p>Overall, the report by law firm Cleary Gottlieb paints a picture of
an agency at which sexual harassment, racial discrimination and bullying
were pervasive at every level and tolerated by senior leaders for years,
while complaints about misconduct were met with retaliation.</p>
<p>“For far too many employees and for far too long, the FDIC has failed
to provide a workplace safe from sexual harassment, discrimination, and
other interpersonal misconduct,” the report said, adding that those
accused of misconduct were frequently reassigned new roles.</p>
<p>Underscoring the agency’s toxic culture, officials tasked with
addressing the problems exposed by the WSJ reports were themselves the
subject of misconduct claims, the Cleary Gottlieb report found.</p>
<p>The findings sparked renewed calls for the ouster of Gruenberg, a
Democrat who has been a senior leader at the agency for nearly two
decades.</p>
<p>Representative Patrick McHenry, a Republican who chairs the House
Financial Services Committee, called for Gruenberg’s resignation
following the report, saying it made clear the agency needs new
leadership.</p>
<p>“The FDIC needs to be fixed. The women and men who work there deserve
better,” Sherrod Brown, chair of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban
Affairs Committee, said in a statement. “Chair Gruenberg must accept
responsibility and must immediately work to make fundamental changes to
the agency and its culture.”</p>
<p>Some employees described Gruenberg as “harsh” and “aggressive,” as
well as prone to losing his temper, the report said. In speaking with
investigators, Gruenberg said he never recalled acting inappropriately.
The report said some employees reported positive interactions with him
and saw his nature as more “prosecutorial.”</p>
<p>In a statement to staff, Gruenberg said the report was “sobering” and
he vowed to implement its recommendations.</p>
<p>He said he was ultimately responsible for everything that happened at
the agency and apologized for any shortcomings. “I again want to express
how very sorry I am,” he added.</p>
<p>The report recommends the appointment of new officials devoted to
changing the FDIC’s culture and hiring an independent third party to
assist in the transition, although it did not consider whether top
leaders should resign.</p>
<p>It also called on the agency to establish an anonymous hotline to
report misconduct and abuse, develop a more timely and transparent
process for handling complaints, and take steps to ensure victims are
protected and supported.</p>
<p>While the report found that Gruenberg’s aggressive conduct was not a
root cause of the more severe issues at the agency, it was skeptical of
his ability to oversee the necessary dramatic overhaul.</p>
<p>“As the FDIC faces a crisis relating to its workplace culture,
Chairman Gruenberg’s reputation raises questions about the credibility
of the leadership’s response to the crisis and the ‘moral authority’ to
lead a cultural transformation,” the report stated.</p>
<p>The departure of Gruenberg, who was appointed by President Joe Biden
in 2022, could imperil the administration’s efforts to impose stricter
financial rules, including a pending regulatory proposal on bank capital
requirements, which has sparked a backlash from Republicans and industry
representatives.</p>
<p>A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>If Gruenberg steps down or is removed, agency bylaws stipulate that
FDIC Vice Chair Travis Hill, a Republican, take over, and the agency’s
board would be evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.</p>

<h2 id="us-holds-up-some-arms-to-israel-sources-say">US holds up some
arms to Israel, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has been
holding up certain Boeing-made arms shipments to Israel, four sources
familiar with the matter told Reuters, in what two of them said was an
apparent political message to the close U.S. ally.</p>
<p>The shipments, which have been delayed for at least two weeks,
involved Boeing-made Joint Direct Attack Munitions, which convert dumb
bombs into precision-guided ones, as well as Small Diameter Bombs.</p>
<p>The sources did not elaborate further, including on the political
nature of the holdups. But they come at a time when Washington is
publicly pressuring Israel to postpone its planned offensive in Rafah
until after it has taken steps to avert civilian casualties.</p>
<p>The White House and Pentagon declined comment. The news of a delayed
arms shipment was first reported by Axios over the weekend and Politico
first reported on the types of arms delayed and the reasoning on
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Without addressing whether there had been a holdup in arms shipments,
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reaffirmed that
Washington’s commitment to Israel’s security was “ironclad.”</p>
<p>Still, when asked about the reports on the arms holdups, she added:
“Two things could be true, in the sense of having those conversations,
tough, direct conversations with our counterparts in Israel … in making
sure citizens lives are protected … and getting that commitment.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon said on Monday that there had not been a policy decision
to withhold arms from Israel, America’s closest Middle East ally.</p>
<p>Still, the delays appeared to be the first since Biden’s
administration offered its full support to Israel following Hamas’
Oct. 7 attack, during which about 1,200 people were killed and about 250
others were abducted. About 133 of them are believed to remain in
captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.</p>
<p>Israel’s campaign to destroy Hamas has led to a seven-month-long
military campaign that has killed a total of 34,789 Palestinians, most
of them civilians, the Gaza Health Ministry said.</p>
<p>The conflict has also left many of Gaza’s 2.3 million people on the
brink of starvation and sparked protests in the U.S. demanding that
universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel - including the
provision of weaponry.</p>
<p>A senior Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of
anonymity, did not confirm any specific holdup in arms supplies but
appeared to take the reports in stride: “As the prime minister has
already said, if we have to fight with our fingernails, then we’ll do
what we have to do.”</p>

soldier detained in Russia; White House says 2nd American newly
detained</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — The U.S. Army has confirmed that a U.S. soldier was
arrested last week during an unauthorized visit to the Russian far
eastern port city of Vladivostok, one of two recently detained Americans
in Russia.</p>
<p>Army spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said Tuesday Staff Sergeant Gordon C.
Black had been stationed in South Korea and signed out on permanent
change of station leave on April 10 en route to Fort Cavazos, Texas.
Instead of returning to the continental United States, Black flew
through China to Vladivostok for “personal reasons.”</p>
<p>“Black did not request official clearance, and [the Department of
Defense] did not authorize his travel to China and Russia, Smith
added. </p>
<p>U.S. officials told VOA he appeared to have traveled to Russia to see
a woman whom he was romantically involved with.</p>
<p>Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Tuesday
the Army is investigating the incident and that any leave to Russia was
“strictly prohibited,” according to the Department of Defense’s foreign
clearance guide.</p>
<p>The White House said on Tuesday it confirmed “two separate cases” of
U.S. citizens being detained in Russia, without identifying the second
detainee.</p>
<p>Russian officials identified the second American as William Russell
Nycum. He was detained 10 days ago in Moscow on petty hooliganism and
alcohol charges, according to the Russian state news agency
RIA-Novosti.</p>
<p>“The State Department is actively seeking consular access to both
individuals, neither of whom are in Russia on behalf or in affiliation
with the U.S. government,” White House press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre told reporters.</p>
<p>A Russian Ministry of Interior official informed the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow on May 3 that Black was arrested a day earlier in Vladivostok for
theft of personal property. Smith said the Army has no further
information about the charge at this time and that Black will remain in
a pretrial detention facility until his next hearing. </p>
<p>According to RFE/RL a TikTok account of Black’s romantic partner,
Vladivostok native Aleksandra Vashchuk, contains numerous videos of the
couple together in South Korea. In one video, Black is wearing his U.S.
Army fatigues and kisses the camera of a woman, presumably Vashchuk, as
she speaks in Russian.</p>
<p>RFE/RL says Vashchuk refers to Black as her husband and
affectionately as “pindos,” a Russian slang word for Americans that
roughly translates to “Yankee punk.”</p>
<p>The Associated Press reports that unnamed officials say Black is
accused of stealing from his “girlfriend.”</p>
<p>The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative
Michael McCaul, said he is “deeply concerned” by reports of the
detainment.</p>
<p>“Putin has a long history of holding American citizens hostage,”
McCaul said in a post shared on X. “A warning to all Americans — as the
State Department has said, it is not safe to travel to Russia.”</p>
<p>Among those being held are journalists Alsu Kurmasheva of RFE/RL and
Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal, who have been detained on
charges that they, their employers and their supporters reject as
politically motivated. </p>
<p>Also being held is Paul Whelan, who in 2020 was convicted and
sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges, which he and the
U.S. government have repeatedly rejected.</p>

id="judge-postpones-trumps-classified-documents-trial-indefinitely">Judge
postpones Trump’s classified documents trial indefinitely</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The federal judge in Florida presiding over the
classified documents prosecution of former President Donald Trump has
canceled the May 20 trial date, postponing it indefinitely. </p>
<p>The order from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had been expected in
light of still-unresolved issues in the case and because Trump is on
trial in a separate case in Manhattan charging him in connection with
hush money payments during the 2016 presidential election. The New York
case involves several of the same lawyers representing him in the
federal case in Florida. </p>
<p>In a five-page order, Cannon said on Tuesday that it would be
imprudent to finalize a new trial date now, casting further doubt on
federal prosecutors’ ability to bring Trump to trial before the November
presidential election. </p>
<p>Trump faces dozens of felony counts accusing him of illegally
hoarding at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, classified
documents that he took with him after he left the White House in 2021,
and then obstructing the FBI’s efforts to get them back. He has pleaded
not guilty and denied wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Trump faces four criminal cases as he seeks to reclaim the White
House, but outside of the New York prosecution, it’s not clear that any
of the other three will reach trial before the election. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court is weighing Trump’s arguments that he is immune
from federal prosecution in a separate case from special counsel Jack
Smith charging him with plotting to overturn the 2020 presidential
election. Prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, have also brought a
separate case related to election subversion, though it’s not clear when
that might reach trial.</p>

<h2 id="biden-calls-out-ferocious-surge-of-antisemitism">Biden calls out
‘ferocious surge’ of antisemitism</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — President Joe Biden on Tuesday called out what he
described as a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism, using a somber speech
to tie together two grim anniversaries: his nation’s annual
commemoration of the Holocaust, and the beginning of the seventh month
of hostilities in Gaza.  </p>
<p>“This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people
in the world,” Biden said as he delivered the keynote address at the
U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Annual Days of Remembrance ceremony.
 </p>
<p>He spoke at the U.S. Capitol before a group of legislators and a few
elderly survivors of Nazi Germany’s move to systematically exterminate 6
million Jews during World War II. </p>
<p>In his remarks, Biden sought to tie that event to militant
Palestinian group Hamas’ stunning attack that killed about 1,200 Israeli
civilians on October 7. The attack provoked a conflict that is ongoing
to this day and has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians.  </p>
<p>“We’ve seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around
the world,” since the October attack, said Biden. “Now here we are, not
75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are
already forgetting, already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this
terror.”</p>
<p>‘You belong’</p>
<p>Biden assured the Jewish community: “You belong. You always have, and
you always will. … My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people,
security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish
state is ironclad, even when we disagree.” </p>
<p>Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs,
applauded Biden’s speech and said in a statement that antisemitism is
everybody’s problem, not just one for Jews.</p>
<p>“Rising antisemitic conspiracy theories and hate are a threat that
undermines each and every American’s safety and our core democratic
norms and values,” Spitalnick said. “We’re grateful for President
Biden’s clear moral leadership confronting this threat, including
through the historic U.S. National Strategy to Counter
Antisemitism. </p>
<p>“We urge Congress to quickly move the Countering Antisemitism Act
forward for a vote, support robust implementation of the National
Strategy, and significantly increase funding for the U.S. Department of
Education’s Office of Civil Rights to investigate fully and address acts
of antisemitism — and all civil rights violations — on campus. It’s time
to make clear that just, inclusive societies are ones in which Jews and
all communities are safe and free.” </p>
<p>Mounting pro-Palestinian protests on U.S. college campuses have
raised questions about whether criticizing the world’s only Jewish state
as it continues to besiege Gaza should be seen as antisemitic
speech. </p>
<p>“It is perfectly OK to object to the policies of a state,” said
Mirette Mabrouk, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. “It is
never OK to be a bigot. So, when the state of Israel conflates the two —
conflates being Jewish with the policies of the state of Israel — it
makes it significantly more difficult for people to object to the
policies of Israel, because you don’t want to come across as being
antisemitic. That is absolute nonsense.” </p>
<p>VOA asked White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre where the
Biden administration draws that line.  </p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have to talk about a line,” she replied. “It’s very
clear. It presents itself in the most hateful, abhorrent way. And
antisemitism is hate speech. It is just hate speech. I’m not going to
stand here and give examples. That’s not something I’m going to do — it
is obvious.”</p>

<h2 id="lpcamm2-memory-is-finally-here">LPCAMM2 memory is finally
here</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>But today we got our hands on LPCAMM2 for the first time, and this
looks like the future to us. LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable,
upgradeable memory standard for laptops, using the latest LPDDR chips
for maximum speed and efficiency. So instead of overpaying (or
under-speccing) based on guesswork about your future memory needs,
you’ll hopefully be able to buy your next laptop and then install more
RAM as needed. Imagine that! ↫ Carsten Frauenheim LPDDR memory, used in
modern laptops, has been difficult – or impossible – to upgrade because
its low power nature means it needs to be located as close to the
processor as possible with short traces, since the longer the traces,
the more power is needed to maintain signal integrity between the
processor and RAM. This would defeat the entire purpose of low-power DDR
memory to begin with. Originally developed by Dell and eventually
adopted by JEDEC and the wider industry, LPCAMM2 solves this problem by
using screw-down RAM modules located right next to the processor. These
modules can, like regular memory modules, be replaced and upgraded when
needed or desired. This is a great leap forward, and I really, really
hope we’re going to see quick, widespread adoption.</p>

<h2 id="gcc-14.1-released">GCC 14.1 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>GCC 14.1 has been released, and it should come as no surprise that
the new features are not exactly something I, someone who doesn’t
program, can properly parse. So, here’s the three items GCC itself
thought were important to list first. The C frontend when targeting
standards newer than C89 now considers many non-standard constructs as
errors that were previously only warnings. See
https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-14/porting_to.html#warnings-as-errors for more
details. C23 _BitInt Bit-precise integer types are now supported, for
now only on IA-32, x86-64 and AArch64. The C++ frontend now implements
several C++26 features, some missing C++23 bits and defect report
resolutions. Diagnostics involving C++ templates now quote source from
the instantiation context. The libstdc++exp.a library now includes all
symbols for the Filesystem TS and the experimental symbols for the C++23
std::stacktrace class, so -lstdc++exp can be used instead of -lstdc++fs.
The libstdc++_libbacktrace.a library is not longer installed. Improved
experimental support for C++20, C++23, and C++26. Updated parallel
algorithms that are compatible with oneTBB. ↫ GCC 14.1 release
announcement GCC 14.1 is available for download, of course, but most of
us will get it once it hits our distribution’s package repositories.</p>

international climate policy, and Liu Zhenmin, the People’s Republic of
China’s special envoy for climate change, along with relevant officials
from both countries, will convene this week’s working-group talks.</p>
<p>“The meeting will focus on areas identified in the Sunnylands
Statement, including energy transition, methane and other non-CO2
greenhouse gases, circular economy and resource efficiency, low-carbon
and sustainable provinces/states and cities, and deforestation, among
others,” according to the State Department.</p>
<p>Sunnylands statement</p>
<p>In November 2023, John Kerry, then-U.S. special presidential envoy
for climate, and Xie Zhenhua, China’s former special envoy for climate
change, met in Sunnylands, California, to reaffirm their commitments to
jointly address the climate crisis.</p>
<p>The agreement focuses on many less competitive areas, according to
analysts.</p>
<p>“For example, in a first, both sides agreed to include methane in
their 2035 climate goals and the agreement highlighted a target of
promoting at least five large-scale cooperative projects in carbon
capture, utilization and storage, or CCUS,” said Jennifer Turner, the
director of the Washington-based Wilson Center’s China Environment
Forum.</p>
<p>CCUS is a process that captures carbon dioxide emissions from sources
like coal-fired power plants and either reuses or stores it so it will
not enter the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In the Sunnylands statement, the U.S. and China also said they are
determined to end plastic pollution.</p>
<p>“The two countries have been meeting at the table for the Global
Plastic Treaty but neither has made plastic a part of the bilateral
talks. As is true in energy, we are also plastic waste superpowers and
what actions we take in this space could also be game changing,” Turner
told VOA on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Digitally connected vehicles and solar panels</p>
<p>However, the climate envoys are likely to steer clear of electric
vehicles as an area for climate cooperation because they have become a
huge area of tension.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has said it would investigate Chinese-made
digitally connected vehicles, citing potential national security risks
and concerns over their capability to collect sensitive information
about American users. On February 29, Biden criticized what it called
PRC’s unfair practices in its auto industry.  </p>
<p>“China’s policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing
risks to our national security,” Biden said in a statement.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have also criticized China’s excess production in
solar panels and lithium-ion batteries. In April, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Janet Yellen said China’s subsidizing of clean energy and
industrial overcapacity “hurts American firms and workers, as well as
firms and workers around the world.”</p>
<p>In October 2023, the European Commission, responsible for trade
policy in the 27-nation European Union, launched an investigation into
potential distortive subsidies for battery electric vehicles
manufactured in China, possibly leading to additional tariffs.</p>
<p>The investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>Chinese officials said the Biden administration’s actions are
discriminatory. They have asked the U.S. to “stop overstretching the
concept of national security” and “stop its discriminatory suppression
against Chinese companies.”</p>
<p>“I would like to stress that Chinese-made cars are popular globally
not by using so-called ‘unfair practices,’ but by emerging from the
fierce market competition with technological innovation and superb
quality,” said a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, Mao Ning, on
March 1 during a briefing in Beijing.</p>
<p>She called the U.S. investigation “trade protectionism” and said,
“such acts of politicizing economic and trade issues will only hinder
the development of the U.S. auto industry itself.”</p>

<h2 id="us-military-completes-construction-of-gaza-aid-pier">US military
completes construction of Gaza aid pier</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. military has finished construction of its Gaza
aid pier, but weather conditions are making it unsafe to move the
two-part facility into place, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The pier, which the U.S. military started building last month and
which will cost at least $320 million, is aimed at boosting deliveries
of desperately needed humanitarian assistance to Gaza, which has been
ravaged by seven months of Israeli operations against Hamas. </p>
<p>“As of today, the construction of the two portions of the JLOTS — the
floating pier and the Trident pier — are complete and awaiting final
movement offshore,” Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told
journalists, using an acronym for Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore, the
official name for the pier capability. </p>
<p>“Today there are still forecasted high winds and high sea swells,
which are causing unsafe conditions for the JLOTS components to be
moved. So the pier sections and military vessels involved in its
construction are still positioned at the port of Ashdod,” in Israel,
Singh said. </p>
<p>U.S. Central Command “stands by to move the pier into position in the
near future,” she added. </p>
<p>The vessels and the under-construction pier were moved to the port
because of bad weather last week. Once the weather clears, the pier will
be anchored to the Gaza shore by Israeli soldiers, keeping U.S. troops
off the ground. </p>
<p>Aid will then be transported via commercial vessels to a floating
platform off the Gaza coast, where it will be transferred to smaller
vessels, brought to the pier, and taken to land by truck for
distribution. </p>
<p>Plans for the pier were first announced by U.S. President Joe Biden
in early March as Israel held up deliveries of assistance by ground, and
U.S. Army troops and vessels soon set out on a lengthy trip to the
Mediterranean to build the pier. </p>
<p>Some two months later, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains
dire. The United Nations said Tuesday that Israel had denied it access
to the Rafah crossing, the key entry point for aid into the
territory.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-in-texas-when-summer-comes-early">What Happens in
Texas When Summer Comes Early</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE4ODEzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MzY5MTQ0M30.g4JwjngfL2Tme9DmBmKx0iopEoA-iJqSHcG0x5eIULI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s getting hot in Texas. Forecast highs for Tuesday are 89 degrees
Fahrenheit in Houston, 92 in San Antonio, and 90 in Dallas. ERCOT, which
operates the energy market that covers around 90% of the state, issued
an “extreme hot weather event” warning and a “weather watch” due to
“unseasonably high temperatures” — and “high levels of expected
maintenance outages.”
</p>
<p>
The whole country, but particularly Texas, is playing chicken with its
existing fleet of natural gas-powered electricity infrastructure. While
the weather-dependence of solar and wind are both obvious and
well-known, gas, too, can be susceptible to nature’s fluctuations. High
temperatures mean high demand, while very low temperatures can literally
freeze whole gas production, distribution, and generation system, with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/the-mega-freeze-of-2022-is-still-haunting-power-plants" target="_blank">catastrophic
consequences</a>.
</p>
<p>
Natural gas powers around 60% of Texas’ electricity. While Tuesday’s is
far from the hottest weather the state will face this year, it comes at
what can be a fragile time for the grid. This is the end of the spring
maintenance season, when power plant operators have a window to schedule
outages necessary to perform maintenance after winter and ahead of
summer, when electricity demand spikes again — what ERCOT calls the
“<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2024/04/26/ERCOT_Trending_Topic_AAN.pdf" target="_blank"><u>shoulder
seasons</u></a>.”
</p>
<p>
But weather increasingly does not conform to the plans of market
regulators, with temperatures rising earlier in the year and falling
later, impinging on that shoulder space. In April, ERCOT had to ask
power plants to delay outages they had
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ercot-asks-texas-power-generators-delay-outages-expected-heat-next-week-2024-04-12/" target="_blank"><u>already
planned</u></a> due to high temperatures in
<a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/news/2024/04/16/experts-warn-ercot-pause-in-maintenance-could-mean-more-breakdowns-during-summer" target="_blank"><u>parts
of the state</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Shutting down a natural gas power plant can be fraught in Texas, where
authorities are wary of destabilizing the grid. Other than 2021’s Winter
Storm Uri, which caused days of blackouts and hundreds of deaths, one of
the state’s worst-ever
<a href="https://www.ercot.com/files/docs/2006/04/27/10._rollblackouts_april_17_200.pdf" target="_blank"><u>blackouts
happened in April 2006</u></a>, when high temperatures coincided with —
you guessed it — planned outages for maintenance. Texas is not the only
place that gets hot in the summer, of course, but its grid is both
isolated from the rest of the country and is dealing with substantial
growth in power demand, which means it’s more likely to bump up against
its limits.<br/>
</p>
<p>
<span></span>“We’ve had a couple of pretty hot days and have more hot
weather this week,” University of Texas professor Hugh Daigle told me.
“What’s happening is that we’ve been operating close to the limit of
available supply at peak demand.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>While the grid in Texas has remained stable so far this
spring — albeit with some
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-california-grid-batteries" target="_self"><u>wild
price spikes</u></a> at times — delaying planned outages risks future
<em>unplanned</em> power failures if operators fall behind on
maintenance. Those failures are most likely to occur during the summer
months, when high demand from air conditioning adds to stresses caused
by the heat and ERCOT is less likely to allow the plants to come
offline. In the best case scenario, a strained grid “only” results in
electricity prices spiking. In the worst, it leads to
<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/01/12/texas-heat-deaths-2023-record-climate-change/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20don't%20wish%20this,tracking%20such%20deaths%20in%201989." target="_blank">blackouts
and deaths</a> from extreme heat.
</p>
<p>
Along with three of his University of Texas colleagues, Joshua Rhodes,
Aidan Pyrcz, and Michael Webber, Daigle recently published a paper
showing that
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S104061902300132X?dgcid=author" target="_blank">as
Texas warms</a>, the times when it’s “safe” to have a large number of
planned outages may shrink.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Average temperatures in the state rose 0.8 degrees Celsius from 1895 to
2021, and are projected to go up another whole degree by 2036. While
that may sound like a small change, this would increase the number of
100 degree Fahrenheit days — which often mean record-breaking
electricity usage — by some 40%.
</p>
<p>
While it may seem like a warming trend could have a symmetric and
offsetting effect on the grid — hotter summer days that lead to record
air conditioning demand but also warmer winter days that create less
strain on electric heat — the researchers found that instead, the
shoulder seasons were getting impinged on both sides. Compared to the
1950s, mild spring weather has been starting and ending earlier. At
mid-century, spring started near the beginning of March; now it’s closer
to the beginning of February. The start of fall, meanwhile, slid from
the beginning of November later toward the middle of the month.
</p>
<p>
If maintenance in the spring shoulder season can just occur just from
March to May, “maintenance periods will no longer coincide with periods
of low expected demand,” Daigle told me. And if it’s just in the fall
season, which could shrink to October and November, “it may be
unreasonable to expect power plants to be able to forgo spring
maintenance.”
</p>
<p>
“If you look at climate models and how average temperatures change,”
Daigle said, “those two periods” — before the cold of winter and the
heat of summer — “could merge into a single period in December and
January.”
</p>
<p>
Just one shoulder season introduces extreme risks, Daigle explained. “We
still do get winter storms. It’s December and January and you have a lot
of stuff down for planned maintenance, and something like Uri comes
through — we’re up a creek.”

<h2 id="russia-bans-us-funded-rights-group-freedom-house">Russia bans
US-funded rights group Freedom House</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Moscow — Russia on Tuesday said it had declared U.S.-funded rights
group Freedom House an “undesirable organization”, effectively banning
anyone from working for or having links with the group.</p>
<p>Authorities in Russia have declared dozens of media outlets, think
tanks and non-profit organizations “undesirable” since 2015, a label
rights groups say is designed to deter dissent.</p>
<p>In a statement, Russia’s Prosecutor General said Freedom House had
called for “comprehensive assistance to Ukraine to defeat Russia” and
had “discredited” the Russian army.</p>
<p>“The organization provides information, financial, legal and other
support to Russian opposition structures, pro-Western and LGBT
activists, communities defending their interests, and persons convicted
of terrorist crimes,” it said.</p>
<p>Freedom House says it supports and provides funding to local
democracy activists and civil liberty groups in more than 30 countries,
receiving much of its financing from the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>It is best known for its “Freedom in the World” index that measures
each country’s civil liberties and labels them “Free” or “Not Free”.
Russia is labelled “Not Free”.</p>
<p>Since launching its offensive in Ukraine, Moscow has waged an
unprecedented crackdown on dissent that rights groups have likened to
Soviet-era mass repression.</p>
<p>Among other organizations labelled as “undesirable” in Russia are the
World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace, Transparency International and Radio
Free Europe/Radio Liberty.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The divide between left and right is one of the most fundamental
markers in politics. But have you ever stopped to think about why we use
those directional terms to describe ideological camps? It may surprise
you to learn that this terminology traces back to the seating
arrangements of French revolutionaries over 200 years ago.</p>

Overflow signs deal with OpenAI, bans users trying to alter answers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’re all aware of Stack Overflow – it’s a place where programmers
and regular users can ask technical questions, and get answers from
anyone who thinks they know the answer. Stack Overflow has become so
ubiquitous among programmers and developers, the concept of “I just
copied the code off Stack Overflow” has become a consistent meme to
indicate you don’t fully grasp how something works, but at least it
works. If you’ve ever contributed answers to Stack Overflow, you might
want to consider deleting them, altering them, or perhaps even go as far
as request a GDPR removal if you’re in the European Union, because Stack
Overflow has just announced a close partnership with “AI” company OpenAI
(or, more accurately, “Open” “AI”). Stripped of marketing speak, the
gist is exactly as you’d expect: OpenAI will absorb the questions and
answers on Stack Overflow into its models, whether their respective
authors like it or not. As much as you may want to try and delete your
answers if you’re not interesting in having your work generate profit
for OpenAI, deleting popular questions and answers is not possible on
Stack Overflow. The other option is altering your answers to render them
useless, but it seems Stack Overflow is not going to allow you to do
this, either. Ben Humphreys tried to alter his highest-rated answers,
and Stack Overflow just reverted them back, and proceeded to ban him
from the platform. Stack Overflow does not let you delete questions that
have accepted answers and many upvotes because it would remove knowledge
from the community. So instead I changed my highest-rated answers to a
protest message. Within an hour mods had changed the questions back and
suspended my account for 7 days. ↫ Ben Humphreys Now that they’ve made
what is most likely an incredibly lucrative deal with OpenAI that’s
going to net Stack Overflow’s owners boatloads of money, they obviously
can’t let users delete or alter their answers to lower the monetary
value of Stack Overflow’s content. Measures to prevent deletion or
alteration are probably one of the clauses in the agreement between
Stack Overflow and OpenAI. So there’s likely not much you can do to not
have your answers sucked into OpenAI, but you should at least be aware
it’s happening in case of future answers you might want to
contribute.</p>

Tesla is finally going to release everything we always wanted to know
about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD), but it’s because NHTSA is

Perhaps dark matter is made of an entirely different kind of particle
than the ones physicists have been searching for. New experiments are

repatriates 11 citizens from camp for relatives of Islamic State
militants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIRUT — The United States has repatriated 11 of its citizens from
sprawling camps in northeastern Syria that house tens of thousands of
family members of suspected Islamic State militants, the U.S. State
Department said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The repatriation was the largest Washington has carried out from the
camps to date, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a
statement. Five of the 11 citizens brought back were children, and one
non-U.S. citizen child — the 9-year-old sibling of one of the other
children — was also brought with them.</p>
<p>As part of the same operation, the U.S. facilitated the repatriation
of 11 other camp residents, eight of them children, to Canada, the
Netherlands and Finland, the statement said.</p>
<p>Although the pace of repatriations has picked up — neighboring Iraq
recently returned hundreds of its citizens — many countries remain
reluctant to bring back citizens from the al Hol and al Roj camps, which
now hold about 30,000 people from more than 60 countries, most of them
children.</p>
<p>The camps are run by local authorities affiliated with the
U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The SDF and its
allies, including U.S.-led coalition forces, defeated the Islamic State
group in Syria in 2019, ending its self-proclaimed Islamic “caliphate”
that had ruled over a large swath of territory straddling Iraq and
Syria.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have regularly reported on what they describe as
inhumane living conditions and abuses in the camps and in detention
centers where suspected Islamic State members are housed.</p>
<p>“The only durable solution to the humanitarian and security crisis”
in the facilities “is for countries to repatriate, rehabilitate,
reintegrate, and where appropriate, ensure accountability for
wrongdoing,” Blinken said in the statement.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>I want to run GoToSocial on some *BSD system. Because I am who I am,
I went for using NetBSD 10.0 . And because my hypervisor is running
bhyve on OmniOS , you get the title of this blog post. Don’t get too
anxious, it is quite straightforward. So let the journey begin. ↫ Joel
Carnat Bhyve is a hypervisor originating from FreeBSD, while OmniOS is a
distribution of illumos, a continuation of the last open source Solaris
release from Oracle. GoToSocial, meanwhile, is an ActivityPub social
network server, so it belongs in the same family as Mastodon, Glitch,
Akkoma, and countless others. This guide makes this whole process look
like a piece of cake, so if you’ve ever been interested in running your
own ActivityPub server – read on. On a slightly related sidenote,
there’s no OSNews AT instance, partly because I don’t want to deal with
the moderation and costs, and partly because I’m incredibly happy being
a member of Exquisite, a Glitch instance running on OpenBSD, managed by
OpenBSD enthusiasts. Never say never, of course, but the odds of seeing
an OSNews AT instance in the future are very slim.</p>

subsidizing livestock farming and shift that financial support over to
more environmentally friendly foods like fruits, vegetables, and
poultry. “Globally, one-third of agricultural subsidies were directed
toward meat and milk products in 2016,” the report said. But subsidies
mask the true costs (environmental or otherwise) of these products.
Cutting them could “lead to significant changes in consumption patterns
and large emissions reductions.”

Investment in overhauling agrifood will need to rise by $260 billion
annually to halve emissions by 2030, the World Bank report said. But the
cost benefits in terms of health, economic, and environmental outcomes
are projected to surpass $4 trillion in 2030, which the report noted is

He instructed top environmental lieutenant Marina Silva to start putting
together a strategy. “We have to stop just running after disaster,” Lula
told the <em>Post</em>. “We have to start preparing for what can happen
from disasters. … We and the world need to prepare every day with more
plans and resources to deal with extreme climate occurrences.” At least
83 people are known to have died in the floods but the death toll is
likely to climb. More than 20,000 people have lost their homes.
Hospitals are without power. Inmates have been released from flooded
prisons. Looting has begun. “This is war; that is the word,” said
journalist Kelly Matos. “It’s hopelessness, civil unrest. … The tsunami
is here.”

<p>In the New York Times today, Amy Qin and Patricia Mazzei reported on
the new Florida law that prohibits many Chinese citizens from buying
property in Florida, especially near important infrastructure like
airports, refineries, and military installations. Qin and Mazzei note
that more than three dozen states either have enacted or are crafting
laws to restrict the purchase of land, businesses, or housing by Chinese
nationals, even if they have legal residence in the United States. The
justification for the laws is that Chinese investment in the U.S. is a
national security risk, although Chinese nationals own less than 400,000
acres in the United States.</p>

protesters break through barricades to retake MIT encampment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Pro-Palestinian protesters who had been blocked by police
from accessing an encampment at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology on Monday broke through fencing, linked arms and encircled
tents that remained there, as Columbia University canceled its
university-wide commencement ceremony following weeks of pro-Palestinian
protests.</p>
<p>Sam Ihns, a graduate student at MIT studying mechanical engineering
and a member of MIT Jews for a Ceasefire, said the group has been at the
encampment for the past two weeks and that they were calling for an end
to the killing of thousands of people in Gaza.</p>
<p>“Specifically, our encampment is protesting MIT’s direct research
ties to the Israeli Ministry of Defense,” he said.</p>
<p>Protesters also sat in the middle of Massachusetts Avenue, blocking
the street during rush hour in the Boston area.</p>
<p>The demonstrations at Columbia have roiled its campus and officials
said Monday that while it won’t hold it’s main ceremony, students will
be able to celebrate at a series of smaller, school-based ceremonies
this week and next.</p>
<p>The decision comes as universities around the country wrangle with
how to handle commencements for students whose high school graduations
were derailed by COVID-19 in 2020. Another campus shaken by protests,
Emory University, announced Monday that it would move its commencement
from its Atlanta campus to a suburban arena. Others, including the
University of Michigan, Indiana University and Northeastern, have pulled
off ceremonies with few disruptions.</p>
<p>Columbia’s decision to cancel its main ceremonies scheduled for May
15 saves its president, Minouche Shafik, from having to deliver a
commencement address in the same part of campus where police dismantled
a protest encampment last week. The Ivy League school in upper Manhattan
said it made the decision after discussions with students.</p>
<p>“Our students emphasized that these smaller-scale, school-based
celebrations are most meaningful to them and their families,” officials
said.</p>
<p>Most of the ceremonies that had been scheduled for the south lawn of
the main campus, where encampments were taken down last week, will take
place about 8 kilometers (5 miles) north at Columbia’s sports complex,
officials said.</p>
<p>Speakers at some of Columbia’s still-scheduled graduation ceremonies
include Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright James Ijames and Dr. Monica
Bertagnolli, director of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Columbia had already canceled in-person classes. More than 200
pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had camped out on Columbia’s green or
occupied an academic building were arrested in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Similar encampments sprouted up elsewhere as universities struggled
with where to draw the line between allowing free expression while
maintaining safe and inclusive campuses.</p>
<p>The University of Southern California earlier canceled its main
graduation ceremony. Students abandoned their camp at USC on Sunday
after being surrounded by police and threatened with arrest.</p>
<p>Other universities have held graduation ceremonies with beefed-up
security. The University of Michigan’s ceremony was interrupted by
chanting a few times Saturday. In Boston on Sunday, some students waved
small Palestinian or Israeli flags at Northeastern University’s
commencement in Fenway Park.</p>
<p>Emory’s ceremonies scheduled for May 13 will be held at the GasSouth
Arena and Convocation Center in Duluth, almost 20 miles (30 kilometers)
northeast of the university’s Atlanta campus, President Gregory Fenves
said in an open letter.</p>
<p>“Please know that this decision was not taken lightly,” Fenves wrote.
“It was made in close consultation with the Emory Police Department,
security advisors and other agencies — each of which advised against
holding commencement events on our campuses.”</p>
<p>The 16,000-student university is one of many that has seen repeated
protests stemming from the conflict that started Oct. 7 when Hamas
militants attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly
civilians, and taking roughly 250 hostages. Student protesters are
calling on their schools to divest from companies that do business with
Israel or otherwise contribute to the war effort.</p>
<p>Vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel launched an offensive in Gaza that
has killed more than 34,500 Palestinians, about two-thirds of them women
and children, according to the Health Ministry in the Hamas-ruled
territory. Israeli strikes have devastated the enclave and displaced
most of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Hamas on Monday announced its acceptance of an Egyptian-Qatari
cease-fire proposal, but Israel said the deal did not meet its “core
demands” and that it was pushing ahead with an assault on the southern
Gaza town of Rafah.</p>
<p>“Cease-fires are temporary,” said Selina Al-Shihabi, a Georgetown
University sophomore who was taking part in a protest at George
Washington. “There can be a cease-fire, but the U.S. government will
continue to arm the Israeli military. We plan to be here until the
university divests or until they drag us out of here.”</p>
<p>At the University of California, San Diego, police cleared an
encampment and arrested more than 64 people, including 40 students.</p>
<p>The University of California, Los Angeles, moved all classes online
for the entire week due to ongoing disruptions following the dismantling
of an encampment last week. The university police force reported 44
arrests but there were no specific details, UCLA spokesperson Eddie
North-Hager said in an email to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Schools are trying various tactics from appeasement to threats of
disciplinary action to get protestors to take down encampments or move
to campus areas where demonstrations would be less intrusive.</p>
<p>The School of the Art Institute of Chicago said in a Facebook post
Sunday that it offered protesters “amnesty from academic sanction and
trespassing charges” if they moved.</p>
<p>“Many protesters left the premises of their own accord after being
notified by the police that they were trespassing and subject to
arrest,” the school said. “Those that remained were arrested after
multiple warnings to leave, including some of whom we recognized as SAIC
students.”</p>
<p>A group of faculty and staff members at University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill asked the administration for amnesty for any students who
were arrested and suspended during recent protests. UNC Faculty and
Staff for Justice in Palestine said in a media advisory that it would
deliver a letter on behalf of more than 500 faculty who support the
student activists.</p>
<p>Other universities took a different approach.</p>
<p>Harvard University’s interim president, Alan Garber, warned students
that those participating in a pro-Palestinian encampment in Harvard Yard
could face “involuntary leave.” That means they would not be allowed on
campus, could lose their student housing and may not be able to take
exams, Garber said.</p>

id="met-gala-in-full-bloom-with-zendaya-jennifer-lopez-mindy-kaling-among-stars">Met
Gala in full bloom with Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Mindy Kaling among
stars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — It’s Met Gala time and the fashion parade of A-listers
Monday included a swirl of flora and fauna looks on a green-tinged
carpet surrounded by foliage. Jennifer Lopez went for silver leaves in a
second-skin goddess gown and Zendaya was all vamp and fantasy.</p>
<p>Both are co-chairs of the annual fundraiser at The Metropolitan
Museum of Art. And both received cheers from the crowd of fashion
enthusiasts packed behind barriers outside.</p>
<p>Flowers were everywhere, in line with this year’s theme: “The Garden
of Time.” Lopez (in Schiaparelli) was all va-va-voom in a near-naked
gown that hugged like a second skin. She’s got the Meta Gala down: It’s
her 14th.</p>
<p>This year’s theme is inspired by J.G. Ballard’s 1962 short story of
the same name.</p>
<p>Zendaya put on her fashion face in hues of blue and green, with a
head piece to match and leaf accents.</p>
<p>It’s been five years since Zendaya last attended the Met Gala. Her
look, in peacock colors, was by Maison Margiela. Lopez went with Tiffany
&amp; Co. diamonds, including a stunning bird motif necklace with a
diamond of over 20 carats at its center.</p>
<p>Mindy Kaling is sure to make the best-dressed lists in sand-colored
swirls that towered over her head at the back. No worries about dinner.
The back was removable. Her look was by Indian couturier Gaurav
Gupta.</p>
<p>Fashion kings and queens … and a good witch</p>
<p>Gigi Hadid brought the drama in a look by the drama king himself,
Thom Browne. her white look was adorned with 2.8 million microbeads with
yellow flowers and green thorns. She was high glam in a wavy bob and
crimson lips.</p>
<p>If there’s a queen of the Met Gala besides the evening’s mastermind,
Anna Wintour, it’s Sarah Jessica Parker. The long-time attendee takes
each year’s theme seriously, researching every detail. This year she was
in an Alice in Wonderland dress with a lavender overlay and a Philip
Treacy topper on her head. The dress was by Richard Quinn. Her long hair
tumbled behind her back in beachy waves, a look that built into a beauty
trend of the evening.</p>
<p>Serena Williams took metallic gold to another level in a shining
one-shoulder statement look. Ariana Grande was all Glinda the Good
Witch, making the most of her pale-colored strapless look with 3D
eyelashes at the side of each eye. She arrived with her “Wicked” co-star
Cynthia Erivo, dressed in black with pink petals in a darker, edgy
look.</p>
<p>Cardi B., who has THE most fun at the Met Gala, struck a pose or
three in statement black with a huge tulle train. She paired the look
with green jewels and a high black turban. She needed multiple helpers
to move her dress up the stairs</p>
<p>Channeling Sleeping Beauty and the garden</p>
<p>Penelope Cruz, meanwhile, went goth in black by Chanel. It had a
bustier top and a Sleeping Beauty-like off-shoulder silhouette. There
was another Sleeping Beauty-ish guest: Kendall Jenner in a Givenchy look
done by Alexander McQueen in 1999.</p>
<p>Kendall’s sister, Kylie Jenner, was more Old Hollywood than storybook
in a chic low-cut strapless look, a white bloom in her clicked-back updo
and a train behind. Oddly, older sister Kim Kardashian tightly covered
up her gorgeous silver corset look with a leaf motif by Maison Margiela
with a lumpy gray sweater.</p>
<p>Dua Lipa was a whole different kind of princess. She went full rock
‘n’ roll in black by Marc Jacobs, who accompanied her.</p>
<p>The princess vibes were in apparent reference to the Met’s spring
exhibition that the gala kicks off. It’s called “Sleeping Beauties:
Reawakening Fashion.” While it doesn’t actually have to do with Disney,
or even princesses, some of the 400 guests went there.</p>
<p>Demi Moore stuck to the garden in a Harris Reed look with huge wings
encircled by arrows and handpainted with pink and white blooms.</p>
<p>Diesel broke through on the gala red carpet on Dove Cameron. It was
about as unlike Diesel as it gets, also going for the garden. The look
had sleeves attached to her train.</p>
<p>Finding deeper meaning in the theme</p>
<p>Lily Gladstone went for black by Gabriela Hearst.</p>
<p>“We wanted me to feel draped in the power of my ancestors,” she said.
“For Kiowa and Blackfeet, our ancestors are the stars, that’s where we
come from. … I feel like it’s so long overdue that we have so much
Indigenous representation and this sort of upper echelon world of high
luxury fashion, because that is our aesthetic, you know, Natives have
always loved luxury.”</p>
<p>Floral looks and a special plus-1</p>
<p>Colman Domingo donned a white jacket with a cape and extra-wide
trousers, holding a bouquet of white calla lilies, while Tyla chose a
gown made to look like sand using actual sand on the fabric. She needed
help with the hourglass she held as she made her way up the museum
stairs. Domingo’s designer was Willy Chavarria.</p>
<p>Sam Smith wore silver and gold metal roses tucked into the waist of a
jacket, and Jack Harlow also channeled florals, but subtly with a silver
and pearl floral boutonniere.</p>
<p>Wintour wore a black coat adorned with multicolored flowers. Her
fellow co-chair Bad Bunny donned all black. A pregnant Lea Michele wore
Rodarte, inspired by the brand’s 2012 spring/summer collection.</p>
<p>“I’m honored to be here and bring my baby with me,” Michele said. ““I
don’t think I was allowed a plus one, but I’m bringing” one, she said
with a laugh. “I’m so grateful. I feel really beautiful, you know, in
this pregnancy.”</p>
<p>Looking to follow along? Here’s a quick primer on what you need to
know about the palooza of A-list celebrities from film, fashion, music,
sports, politics and social media.</p>
<p>Among those who had way BIG fun with the nature and garden theme was
Lana Del Rey. She walked up the museum steps as an actual tree, her face
shrouded by fabric held up by her branches.</p>
<p>How to watch the Met Gala</p>
<p>That’s tricky. Vogue has the exclusive livestream, which starts at 6
p.m. Eastern at Vogue.com. The feed will also be available on Vogue’s
digital platforms, including TikTok and YouTube.</p>
<p>Tons of other media will be on site, too. Catch the action on E!,
also starting at 6 p.m., with livestreams on X, TikTok, Instagram and
Peacock.</p>
<p>The Associated Press will be live outside the Mark Hotel, where many
celebs get ready before heading to The Metropolitan Museum of Art for
their walk up the grand staircase. That livestream will begin at 4:45
p.m. Eastern and will be available on YouTube and APNews.com.</p>
<p>Only the event’s stacked red carpet is watchable — the gala’s
cocktail hour and dinner are notoriously private events.</p>
<p>What’s the point of the Met Gala?</p>
<p>It’s a party, for sure, with cocktails and dinner for about invited
400 guests, but it’s also a huge fundraiser for the Met’s Costume
Institute, the only department at the museum required to pay for itself.
Last year, the gala raised about $22 million. Wintour, a Met trustee for
whom part of the institute has been renamed, organizes the whole
shebang. No phones are allowed, adding to the allure.</p>
<p>It also promotes the museum’s exhibit, which this year is called
“Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion.” It includes 250 items from The
Costume Institute’s permanent collection, including some garments very
rarely seen in public and so fragile they need to be under glass.
Curators wanted to engage all the senses, including smell.</p>
<p>The exhibit opens to the public Friday and runs through Sept. 2.</p>
