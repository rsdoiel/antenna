Turns out, we weren’t very spendy in the first month of the year. In
January, retail sales were down 0.8% — more than many economists
expected. It’s an indicator that consumers are feeling weary of high
prices and becoming more value-oriented. We’ll discuss. Also on the
show: Express, once a mainstay of every mall, could soon file for
bankruptcy. Then, college endowments see big returns thanks to solid
stock market gains.

id="judge-sets-march-trial-date-in-donald-trumps-new-york-hush-money-case">Judge
Sets March Trial Date in Donald Trump’s New York Hush-Money Case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — A New York judge says former President Donald Trump’s
hush-money trial will go ahead as scheduled with jury selection starting
on March 25.</p>
<p>Judge Juan Manuel Merchan said Thursday that he made the decision
after speaking with the judge in Trump’s now-delayed federal election
interference case in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>Trump entered the courthouse shortly before 9 a.m.</p>
<p>It was Trump’s first return visit to court in the New York criminal
case since that historic indictment made him the first ex-president
charged with a crime. Since then, he has also been indicted in Florida,
Georgia and Washington, D.C. In recent weeks, he’s blended campaign
events with court appearances, attending on Monday a closed hearing in a
Florida case charging him with hoarding classified records.</p>
<p>Judge Juan Manuel Merchan has taken steps in recent weeks to prepare
for a trial.  </p>
<p>Over the past year, Trump has lashed out at Merchan as a
“Trump-hating judge,” asked him to step down from the case and sought to
move the case from state court to federal court, all to no avail.
Merchan has acknowledged making several small donations to Democrats,
including $15 to Trump’s rival Joe Biden, but said he’s certain of his
“ability to be fair and impartial.”</p>
<p>Thursday’s proceeding was part of a busy, overlapping stretch of
legal activity for the Republican presidential front-runner, who has
increasingly made his court involvement part of his political
campaign.</p>
<p>The recent postponement of a March 4 trial date in Trump’s
Washington, D.C. election interference case removed a major hurdle to
starting the New York case on time.</p>
<p>Just as the New York hearing got underway, a judge in Atlanta is set
to hear arguments Thursday over whether Fulton County District Attorney
Fani Willis should be disqualified from Trump’s Georgia election
interference case because of a “personal relationship” with Nathan Wade,
a special prosecutor she hired for the case.</p>
<p>Trump is also awaiting a decision, possibly as early as Friday, in a
New York civil fraud case that threatens to upend his real estate
empire. If the judge rules against Trump, who is accused of inflating
his wealth to defraud banks, insurers and others, he could be on the
hook for millions of dollars in penalties among other sanctions.</p>

<li>Americans are buying 675 EVs a day with the help of the IRA
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Car sellers sold more than 25,000 tax credit-eligible
electric vehicles between January 1 and February 6, according to new
Treasury data. That’s an average of more than 675 EVs sold at a
government-sponsored discount per day, <em>Heatmap</em>’s Emily
Pontecorvo
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f44b14d88a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calculated</a>.
To put that in perspective, about 1.08 million cars were sold in total
in the month of January, according to Cox Automotive, or about 34,840
per day. So the tax credit-supported EVs were only about 2% of the total
cars sold. But 25,000 discounted EVs is nothing to scoff at considering
that fewer models are eligible now than last year. Also, the Treasury
said it has paid approximately $135 million in advance payments to
dealers for about 19,000 of the EVs sold this year. “So even with fewer
options available, buyers are still taking advantage of the new instant
rebate and finding vehicles that work for them,” Pontecorvo said.

<li>DoE funnels more money into heat pump manufacturing

<strong></strong>The Department of Energy (DoE) yesterday

it was making an additional $63 million available to speed up the
adoption of residential heat pumps across the country. This is on top of
the $169 million in federal funding announced in November of last year.
The goal is to boost manufacturing of heat pump systems, but with this
new influx of cash, it seems the DoE also wants to wake Americans up to
the benefits of using a heat pump to heat and cool water. Its
announcement notes that heat pump water heaters can be up to three times
more energy efficient than conventional water heaters. “Basically, the
federal funding is aiming to nix the use of gas in a home wherever
possible,”

Matt Simon at <em>Wired</em>. Ali Zaidi, assistant to the president and
national climate adviser, told Simon that “we’re really seeing, I think,
a sea change across the country in terms of how people heat and cool
their homes.” Data shows that in 2023,

<p>
<strong></strong>Google is teaming up with the Environmental Defense
Fund (EDF) to help track methane emissions from space. The MethaneSAT –
a satellite developed specifically to monitor methane emissions – will
launch into orbit next month. Google will use artificial intelligence to
create a map of oil and gas infrastructure locations across the world.
“Once we have that map, then we can overlay methane data,” said Yael
Maguire, head of Google’s Geo Sustainability team. This will offer a
“far better understanding of the types of machinery that contributes
most to methane leaks.”

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that’s far more warming than carbon
dioxide. But it breaks down in the atmosphere more quickly that CO2, so
slashing it is seen as “one of the cheapest, fastest ways to curb global
warming in the short term,”
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=193c4f42d8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>
<em>Bloomberg</em>. Fossil fuel operations tend to dramatically
underreport their methane releases, so the hope is that more
transparency about emissions will encourage reduction efforts from
producers, but reductions “can increase costs in the short term and slow
output,” <em>Bloomberg</em> noted.

rice is pink, firm, and high in protein and fat. Unlike some other meat

and have a lower carbon footprint per gram of protein than beef, leading
its creators to declare it “a novel food ingredient that can overcome

Since President Joe Biden took office, more than 3.6 million people have
had their federal loans forgiven in full. But what’s that mean for your
tax bill? While you don’t have to worry about federal taxes, state taxes
could be another story. We’ll provide a helpful explainer. Plus,
consumers complain about high prices but spend anyway, and that’s
helping turn shoppers on to off brands.

recession</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Japan’s economy unexpectedly shrank
for the second quarter in a row last year, meaning the country has
slipped into recession and lost its spot as the world’s third largest
economy. Meanwhile, the U.K. also fell into recession during the final
three months of last year. Plus, thousands of vehicles shipped by
Volkswagen have been held up at U.S. ports over a Chinese-made
component.

essay</a> on software bloat and the insecurities it causes.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The world ships too much code, most of it by third parties, sometimes
unintended, most of it uninspected. Because of this, there is a huge
<i>attack surface</i> full of mediocre code. Efforts are ongoing to
improve the quality of code itself, but many exploits are due to logic
fails, and less progress has been made scanning for those. Meanwhile,
great strides could be made by paring down just how much code we expose
to the world. This will increase time to market for products, but
legislation is around the corner that should force vendors to take
security more seriously…

<p>At a hillside cemetery near the central Texas town of Gatesville,
Sergeant Richard Rudd was finally laid to rest, nearly 80 years after he
was killed in action. Attendance at the burial last December was light,
as the late infantryman had few close relatives. The Army Honor Guard
presented Rudd’s grand-niece with a folded flag and spoke the words
repeated at countless military memorials: “On behalf of the president of
the United States, the United States Army, and a grateful nation, please
accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your loved one’s
honorable and faithful service.”</p>

<p>
Dating back to the early 20th century, Santa Clarita has stood as a
favored filming destination with silent movie productions seeking the
region’s scenic backdrop for their films. The vast expanses of rugged
mountains, sprawling ranches and iconic canyons provided filmmakers with
a versatile canvas for their storytelling. Stars such as Charlie
Chaplin, Harry Carey […]

<h2
id="volkswagen-cars-blocked-by-us-customs-over-part-from-china">Volkswagen
Cars Blocked By US Customs Over Part From China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Berlin — German automaker Volkswagen said Wednesday several of its
models had been refused entry into the United States, after it emerged
that a Chinese-made component may have breached labor laws.</p>
<p>“We are working to rectify a delay in delivering certain Volkswagen
Group vehicles from ports to dealers due to a customs issue,” Volkswagen
said in a statement.</p>
<p>The trouble related to a “small electronic component,” which was “in
the process of being replaced,” Volkswagen said.</p>
<p>The part, said to be from “western China,” was found to be in breach
of U.S. anti-forced labor laws, according to the Financial Times, which
reported the news first. The Financial Times said Porsche, Bentley and
Audi models were affected.</p>
<p>According to the report, Volkswagen was not aware of the origin of
the part, having sourced it from a supplier.</p>
<p>The German auto group was made aware of the issue by a supplier and
notified U.S. authorities, per the report.</p>
<p>Volkswagen said it “takes allegations of infringements of human
rights very seriously, both within the company and in the supply
chain.”</p>
<p>“As soon as we received information of allegations regarding one of
our sub-suppliers, we have been investigating the matter,” the group
said.</p>
<p>The United States has banned most imports from Xinjiang, in western
China, unless companies offer verifiable proof that production did not
involve forced labor.</p>
<p>Rights campaigners have for years accused Beijing of a brutal
crackdown against the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang,
including through forced labor and detention camps. Beijing denies the
allegations of abuse.</p>
<p>The issue of forced labor is acutely sensitive for Volkswagen, which
has long been plagued by questions over its factory in the region,
operated by its local partner SAIC.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Volkswagen said it was discussing the future of
its activities in China’s troubled Xinjiang province, after the
Handelsblatt daily reported that forced labor may have been used to
build a test track in Turpan, Xinjiang.</p>
<p>VW said it had seen no evidence of human rights violations in
connection with the project but that it would likewise investigate any
new information that came to light.</p>

id="private-us-moon-lander-launched-half-century-after-last-apollo-lunar-mission">Private
US Moon Lander Launched Half Century After Last Apollo Lunar
Mission</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A moon lander built by Houston-based
aerospace company Intuitive Machines was launched from Florida early
Thursday on a mission to conduct the first U.S. lunar touchdown in more
than a half century and the first by a privately owned spacecraft.</p>
<p>The company’s Nova-C lander, dubbed Odysseus, lifted off shortly
after 1 a.m. EST (0600 GMT) atop a Falcon 9 rocket flown by Elon Musk’
SpaceX from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p>A live NASA-SpaceX online video feed showed the two-stage, 25-story
rocket roaring off the launch pad and streaking into the dark sky over
Florida’s Atlantic coast, trailed by a fiery yellowish plume of
exhaust.</p>
<p>The launch, previously set for Wednesday morning, was postponed for
24 hours because of irregular temperatures detected in liquid methane
used in the lander’s propulsion system. SpaceX said the issue was later
resolved.</p>
<p>Although considered an Intuitive Machines mission, the IM-1 flight is
carrying six NASA payloads of instruments designed to gather data about
the lunar environment ahead of NASA’s planned return of astronauts to
the moon later this decade.</p>
<p>Thursday’s launch came a month after the lunar lander of another
private firm, Astrobotic Technology, suffered a propulsion system leak
on its way to the moon shortly after being placed in orbit on January 8
by a United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan rocket making its debut
flight.</p>
<p>The failure of Astrobotic’s Peregrine lander, which was also flying
NASA payloads to the moon, marked the third time a private company had
been unable to achieve a “soft landing” on the lunar surface, following
ill-fated efforts by companies from Israel and Japan.</p>
<p>Those mishaps illustrated the risks NASA faces in leaning more
heavily on the commercial sector than it had in the past to realize its
spaceflight goals.</p>
<p>Plans call for Intuitive Machines’ Nova-C vehicle, a hexagonal
cylinder with four legs, to reach its destination after about a weeklong
flight on February 22 for a landing at crater Malapert A near the moon’s
south pole.</p>
<p>If successful, the flight would represent the first controlled
descent to the lunar surface by a U.S. spacecraft since the final Apollo
crewed moon mission in 1972, and the first by a private company.</p>
<p>The feat also would mark the first journey to the lunar surface under
NASA’s Artemis moon program, as the U.S. races to return astronauts to
Earth’s natural satellite before China lands its own crewed spacecraft
there.</p>
<p>IM-1 is the latest test of NASA’s strategy of paying for the use of
spacecraft built and owned by private companies to slash the cost of the
Artemis missions, envisioned as precursors to human exploration of
Mars.</p>
<p>By contrast, during the Apollo era, NASA bought rockets and other
technology from the private sector, but owned and operated them
itself.</p>
<p>NASA announced last month that it was delaying its target date for a
first crewed Artemis moon landing from 2025 to late 2026, while China
has said it was aiming for 2030.</p>
<p>Small landers such as Nova-C are expected to get there first,
carrying instruments to closely survey the lunar landscape, its
resources and potential hazards. Odysseus will focus on space weather
interactions with the moon’s surface, radio astronomy, precision landing
technologies and navigation.</p>
<p>Intuitive Machine’s IM-2 mission is scheduled to land at the lunar

several small rovers.</p>
<p>Last month, Japan became the fifth country to place a lander on the
moon, with its space agency JAXA achieving an unusually precise
“pinpoint” touchdown of its SLIM probe last month. Last year, India
became the fourth nation to land on the moon, after Russia failed in an
attempt the same month.</p>
<p>The United States, the former Soviet Union and China are the only
other countries that have carried out successful soft lunar touchdowns.
China scored a world first in 2019 by achieving the first landing on the
far side of the moon.</p>

Officials Push Back After Lawmaker Sounds Alarm on Security Threat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The White House along with other top officials are
seeking to reassure the American public after a key lawmaker sounded
alarms about a “serious national security threat” facing the United
States.</p>
<p>In an unusual move that caught some of his fellow lawmakers by
surprise, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee publicly
called on President Joe Biden to declassify intelligence on the unnamed
threat so that the American public and its allies could formulate a
response.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Mike Turner declined to elaborate. But in
an email Turner reportedly sent to colleagues, shared on social media by
various news outlets, he described the danger as a “foreign military
destabilizing capability.”</p>
<p>Several media outlets, quoting U.S. officials, reported late
Wednesday that the threat involves a new Russian space-based
capability.</p>
<p>But a U.S. official, speaking to VOA on the condition of anonymity
due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence, said that while the
danger is significant, it is not imminent.</p>
<p>“The threat described does not involve an active capability that has
been deployed,” the official said.</p>
<p>The White House also sought to downplay concerns, noting it was
already set to brief lawmakers on some of the details Thursday.</p>
<p>“I’m confident that President Biden, in the decisions that he is
taking, is going to ensure the security of the American people going
forward,” said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan.</p>
<p>“We believe that we can and will and are protecting the national
security of the United States,” Sullivan told reporters, adding he was
surprised that Turner took his concerns public since they were scheduled
to meet for a classified briefing Thursday.</p>
<p>Sullivan also defended the decision not to make the threat
intelligence public, pointing both to concerns about protecting U.S.
“sources and methods,” and the president’s willingness to declassify
intelligence in the past.</p>
<p>“You definitely are not going to find an unwillingness to do that
when it’s in our national security interests to do so,” he said. “This
administration has gone further and, in more creative, more strategic
ways, dealt with the declassification of intelligence in the national
interest of the United States than any administration in history.”</p>
<p>Some key lawmakers also pushed back.</p>
<p>The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes,
called the threat “a significant one” but “not a cause for panic.”</p>
<p>“As to whether more can be declassified about this issue, that is a
worthwhile discussion,” he added in a statement. “But it is not a
discussion to be had in public.”</p>
<p>The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee likewise sought to
allay concerns.</p>
<p>The committee “has the intelligence in question and has been
rigorously tracking this issue from the start,” Democratic Chairman Mark
Warner and Republican Vice Chairman Marco Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We continue to take this matter seriously and are discussing an
appropriate response with the administration,” they added. “In the
meantime, we must be cautious about potentially disclosing sources and
methods that may be key to preserving a range of options for U.S.
action.”</p>
<p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson separately told reporters
multiple times there is “no need for public alarm.”</p>
<p>“I want to assure the American people,” Johnson said. “We just want
to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We’re working on it
and there’s no need for alarm.”</p>
<p>VOA’s Patsy Widakuswara and Katherine Gypson contributed to this
report.</p>

id="special-counsel-asks-supreme-court-to-let-trumps-2020-election-case-go-to-trial">Special
Counsel Asks Supreme Court to Let Trump’s 2020 Election Case Go to
Trial</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Special counsel Jack Smith urged the U.S. Supreme Court
on Wednesday to let former President Donald Trump’s 2020 election
interference case proceed to trial without further delay. </p>
<p>Prosecutors were responding to a Trump team request from earlier in
the week asking for a continued pause in the case as the court considers
whether to take up the question of whether the former president is
immune from prosecution for official acts in the White House. Two lower
courts have overwhelmingly rejected that position, prompting Trump to
ask the high court to intervene. </p>
<p>The case — one of four criminal prosecutions confronting Trump — has
reached a critical juncture, with the Supreme Court’s next step capable
of helping determine whether Trump stands trial this year in Washington
or whether the proceedings are going to be postponed by weeks or months
of additional arguments. </p>
<p>The trial date, already postponed once by Trump’s immunity appeal, is
of paramount importance to both sides. Prosecutors are looking to bring
Trump to trial this year while defense lawyers have been seeking delays
in his criminal cases. If Trump were to be elected with the case
pending, he could presumably use his authority as head of the executive
branch to order the Justice Department to dismiss it or could
potentially seek to pardon himself. </p>
<p>Rapid response</p>
<p>Reflecting their desire to proceed quickly, prosecutors responded to
Trump’s appeal within two days even though the court had given them
until next Tuesday. </p>
<p>Though their filing does not explicitly mention the upcoming November
election or Trump’s status as the front-runner in the race for the
Republican presidential nomination, prosecutors described the case as
having “unique national importance” and said that “delay in the
resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest
in a speedy and fair verdict.” </p>
<p>“The national interest in resolving those charges without further
delay is compelling,” they wrote. </p>
<p>Smith’s team charged Trump in August with plotting to overturn the
results of the 2020 presidential election, including by participating in
a scheme to disrupt the counting of electoral votes in the run-up to the
January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, when his supporters stormed
the building in a violent clash with police. </p>
<p>“The charged crimes strike at the heart of our democracy. A
president’s alleged criminal scheme to overturn an election and thwart
the peaceful transfer of power to his successor should be the last place
to recognize a novel form of absolute immunity from federal criminal
law,” they wrote. </p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers have argued that he is shielded from prosecution for
acts that fell within his official duties as president — a legally
untested argument since no other former president has been
indicted. </p>
<p>The trial judge and then a federal appeals court rejected those
arguments, with a three-judge appeals panel last week saying, “We cannot
accept that the office of the Presidency places its former occupants
above the law for all time thereafter.” </p>
<p>The proceedings have been effectively frozen by Trump’s immunity
appeal, with U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan canceling a March 4 trial
date while the appeals court considered the matter. No new date has been
set. </p>
<p>Further delays possible</p>
<p>Trump’s appeal and request for the Supreme Court to get involved
could cause further delays depending on what the justices decide. In
December, Smith and his team had urged the justices to take up and
decide the immunity issue, even before the appeals court weighed in. But
the court declined. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s options include rejecting the emergency appeal,
which would enable Chutkan to restart the trial proceedings in
Washington’s federal court. The court also could extend the delay while
it hears arguments on the immunity issue. In that event, the schedule
the justices set could determine how soon a trial might begin, if indeed
they agree with lower-court rulings that Trump is not immune from
prosecution. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, prosecutors urged the court to reject Trump’s petition
to hear the case, saying that lower-court opinions rejecting immunity
for the former president “underscore how remote the possibility is that
this Court will agree with his unprecedented legal position.” </p>
<p>But if the court does want to decide the matter, Smith said, the
justices should hear arguments in March and issue a final ruling by late
June. </p>
<p>Prosecutors also pushed back against Trump’s argument that allowing
the case to proceed could chill future presidents’ actions for fear they
could be criminally charged once they leave office and open the door to
politically motivated cases against former commanders-in-chief. </p>
<p>“That dystopian vision runs contrary to the checks and balances built
into our institutions and the framework of the Constitution,” they
wrote. “Those guardrails ensure that the legal process for determining
criminal liability will not be captive to ‘political forces,’ as
applicant forecasts.”</p>

Sanctions Iran Central Bank Subsidiary, Says It Violated Export
Rules</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. on Wednesday sanctioned three people and four
firms — across Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey — for allegedly
helping to export goods and technology purchased from U.S. companies to
Iran and the nation’s central bank. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said
the procurement network transferred U.S. technology for use by Iran’s
Central Bank in violation of U.S. export restrictions and
sanctions. </p>
<p>Some of the materials acquired by the Central Bank of Iran were items
classified as “information security items subject to national security
and anti-terrorism controls” by the Commerce Department, Treasury
said. </p>
<p>Included in the sanctions package was Informatics Services Corp., an
Iranian subsidiary of Iran’s Central Bank that most recently developed
the Central Bank Digital Currency platform for the bank; a UAE-based
front company, which acquired U.S. tech for the Central Bank of Iran and
the front company’s CEO; and a Turkey-based affiliate firm that also
made purchases that ended up in Iran. </p>
<p>“The Central Bank of Iran has played a critical role in providing
financial support to” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the
militant group Hezbollah, said Treasury Undersecretary Brian E. Nelson,
adding that they were the “two key actors intent on further
destabilizing the Middle East.” </p>
<p>“The United States will continue to use all available means to
disrupt the Iranian regime’s illicit attempts to procure sensitive U.S.
technology and critical inputs,” he said. </p>
<p>The sanctions block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and
prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with
Americans.</p>

<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQ3MDgwMC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxMTEyMzg0MX0.sXtQEpPT37ucqWqv4FXFSHLSE0UOt1vrHaCzFmuY4R0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Earlier this week, I was thinking to myself, how are we going to know
how many people are actually taking advantage of the tax credits in the
Inflation Reduction Act?<br/>
</p>
<p>
When I put the question out on Twitter — I mean, X — I
<a href="https://twitter.com/samh510/status/1757186456433336412" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">heard
from Sam Hughes</a>, a researcher inside the Treasury who pointed me to
a section of the department’s website that contains data on tax credits
by year. The problem is, it hasn’t been updated since 2020. But then
today, as if to answer my prayers, I received a taste of the data I was
looking for in my inbox.
</p>
<p>
A Treasury official shared that the IRS has received notices from car
sellers indicating they sold more than 25,000 tax credit-eligible
vehicles between January 1 and February 6. That’s an average of more
than 675 EVs sold at a government-sponsored discount per day.
</p>
<p>
To put that in perspective, about 1.08 million cars were sold in total
in the month of January,
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/news/cox-automotive-forecast-january-2024-u-s-auto-sales-forecast/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to Cox Automotive</a>, or about 34,840 per day. So the tax
credit-supported EVs were only about 2% of the total cars sold.
</p>
<p>
But 25,000 discounted EVs is nothing to scoff at — especially since
starting January 1, two big changes were made to the tax credit that
made it both harder and easier for Americans to get them.
</p>
<p>
First, new rules that limit what countries the components in eligible
EVs are allowed to come from had the effect of disqualifying a lot of
EVs from the tax credit. As of today, only 22 models from Chevy, Ford,
Rivian, Tesla, and Volkswagen qualify,
<a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to the Department of Energy</a>. Last year, there were 35 models.
</p>
<p>
But at the same time, car buyers were given the option to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ev-tax-credit-2024-7500-4000" target="_self">transfer
the tax credit to their dealer</a> at the point of sale. That meant the
dealer could take the $7,500 discount for new EVs, or $4,000 for used
EVs, directly off the price of the car. Buyers no longer have to worry
about whether or not they will owe $7,500 in taxes at the end of the
year, or wait around for their tax return, to get that money back.
</p>
<p>
The Treasury said it has paid approximately $135 million in advance
payments to dealers for about 19,000 of the EVs sold this year.
</p>
<p>
So even with fewer options available, buyers are still taking advantage
of the new instant rebate and finding vehicles that work for them. The
vast majority of the EVs sold — more than 22,000 — were new cars, while
just over 3,000 were used EVs.
</p>
<p>
One disheartening stat included in the data is that some 11,000
dealerships have registered with the IRS to sell tax credit-eligible
vehicles. As of last year, there were just over 16,800 dealerships in
the country, according to the National Automobile Dealerships
Association, so that means only about 65% of dealerships can offer
customers the EV tax credit. Many
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/11/09/car-dealerships-ev-sales/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dealers
are not yet on board</a> with the electric revolution. They take longer
to sell and require less maintenance, cutting into profits.
</p>
<p>
The Treasury official said the department was trying to increase
registrations via trade association partners, webinars, and conferences.
</p>
<p>
This smidgeon of data is not enough to assess how well the tax credits
are working, and I hope that after tax day, the agency releases similar
information about how many people claimed other IRA-related tax credits
last year.

id="chinas-economic-woes-may-give-us-chance-to-pressure-north-korea-some-experts-say">China’s
Economic Woes May Give US Chance to Pressure North Korea, Some Experts
Say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Some Asia experts are calling for tough new economic
sanctions on China, arguing that the nation’s economic downturn makes it
particularly vulnerable to pressure to crack down on North Korea’s
ability to make and launder money for its nuclear weapons and missile
programs. </p>
<p>Other analysts argue the opposite, saying new sanctions now would
make Beijing less receptive to U.S. efforts to get it to help curb
Pyongyang’s weapons programs. </p>
<p>“Beijing is worried that a long or deep recession would lead to
political unrest,” and “that worry gives Washington greater leverage
over Beijing — leverage that it didn’t have during the period of strong
Chinese economic growth,” said Joshua Stanton, an attorney based in
Washington, D.C., who helped draft the Sanctions and Policy Enforcement
Act in 2016.  </p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted in a report last
month that China’s economy will slow from 5.2% GDP growth in 2023 to
4.6% this year, further declining into 4.1% in 2025. </p>
<p>China’s manufacturing activities contracted for the fourth
consecutive month in January and the country is further troubled by
soaring debt in the property market and local governments. </p>
<p>In an email to VOA last Friday, Stanton said the Biden administration
should “increase pressure on a central government that fears any
regional recession” and “designate canneries and sweatshops that employ
North Korean labor.”  </p>
<p>Chinese factories are known to employ North Korean laborers and label
products they manufactured as made in China. Approximately 3,000 North
Koreans working illegally in China staged a violent protest in January
over unpaid wages, according to Reuters, citing South Korea’s
intelligence agency.  </p>
<p>In 2017, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution urging
countries to repatriate all North Korean workers by December 2019 to
curb Pyongyang’s ability to make income abroad that supports its weapons
programs. North Korean workers remit most of their overseas earnings to
the regime. </p>
<p>Stanton argued that Washington should also “apply enhanced scrutiny
to local bank branches in Chinese cities” that launder money for North
Korea. “China always promises to cooperate if we don’t sanction its
banks, but it always breaks those promises,” he said. </p>
<p>China been tightening regulations on its banks that deal with Russia
recently in response to strengthened U.S. sanctions on financial
institutions that work with the Russian military.</p>
<p>Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, dismissed the Biden administration’s current North Korea
sanctions as “weak and ineffective.” </p>
<p>“The administration should target North Korea’s revenue generation
and Russian and Chinese banks, entities, and individuals aiding
Pyongyang’s sanctions evasion,” he said.  </p>
<p>David Asher, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said North
Korea still works “largely via China” to finance and acquire
high-technology products for its military and weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) programs. </p>
<p>Asher, who oversaw the disruption of North Korea’s illegal trading
and WMD networks during the George W. Bush administration, said last
Saturday via email that there is a “robust” criminal sector in China,
“especially Macao and Hong Kong, where North Korean elites continue to
launder money including billions of dollars generated via
cybercrime.” </p>
<p>But other experts are warning against sanctioning China, especially
when its economy is slowing, and the U.S. is trying to get Beijing’s
help to curb to North Korea’s missile launches.  </p>
<p>“You can twist the knob on China and try to enforce more pain in
return for its support on North Korea,” said Ken Gause, senior adversary
analytics specialist at the Center for Naval Analyses, in a telephone
interview on Friday. </p>
<p>“But that will blow up in your face because then, China would see us
actively trying to harm China to get it to do something on North
Korea.”</p>
<p>He continued, “China will not react very well to that, and we could
actually make the situation much worse.”</p>
<p>He added that “the only way sanctions would work” is when there are
“overlapping U.S. and Chinese strategic equities.”</p>
<p>Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and WMD
during the Obama administration, agreed during a telephone interview on
Monday that the Biden administration may be concerned that sanctioning
Chinese entities would make Beijing “less likely to cooperate on
diplomatic efforts.” </p>
<p>Samore, who is currently professor of the practice of politics at
Brandeis University, added that even if some Chinese entities stopped
doing business with North Korea because of sanctions, there could be
other Chinese entities that would be willing to work with North
Korea.</p>

Geothermal About to Become the Solar of the 2020s?</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
Fervo Energy is getting a lot better at drilling holes. According to
data presented this week at Stanford University, it took the company 71
days to drill a geothermal well back in 2022. But last year in Utah,
Fervo was able to get drilling down to 21 days, despite those wells
being over 2,000 feet deeper. That has reduced drilling time by
<a href="https://fervoenergy.com/fervo-energy-drilling-results-show-rapid-advancement-of-geothermal-performance/" target="_blank">70%</a>.
</p>
<p>
Fervo is a buzzy, well-funded, and well-connected startup out of Houston
that drills wells to produce enhanced geothermal energy, a clean source
of power derived from heat beneath the Earth’s surface. But whereas
traditional geothermal means tapping into hot water or steam
underground, Fervo drills as deep as 9,000 feet down to access hot
rocks, which are far more ubiquitous, and then pumps water into them,
potentially unlocking many more areas for this kind of power generation.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>This week’s announcement follows a pilot project last year
where the company
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/fervo-energy-says-it-has-achieved-geothermal-energy-tech-breakthrough" target="_blank">was
actually able to produce electricity</a>. Now the challenge is producing
that electricity at scale — and that requires drilling faster.
</p>
<p>
Already its new timeline is translating in dramatic cost reductions, the
company says, from $9.4 million to $4.8 million per well. For its Utah
site, where it might need to drill
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-announces-decision-fervo-energy-cape-modern-geothermal-exploration-project" target="_blank">29
wells</a>, back-of-the-envelope math suggests that could translate into
up to $130 million in savings.
</p>
<p>
“The biggest expense in drilling is time it takes to drill. The easiest
way to reduce drilling costs is to drill faster,” Fervo’s co-founder and
chief executive Tim Latimer told me. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
Latimer’s big idea behind Fervo is not just a conceptual one about how
to generate geothermal power in areas that don’t produce steam or very
hot water on their own, but also about how to apply the steady
improvement and cost reductions seen in the oil and gas industry to
non-carbon emitting power generation that can be available 24 hours a
day.
</p>
<p>
“Oil and gas drilling has become incredibly much more efficient. That’s
what drove the shale revolution. We were excited about 45-day wells and
now you’ll see fields where people drill wells in 10 days or less,”
Latimer told me.
</p>
<p>
Some of the improvement Fervo has achieved is due to porting over
specific pieces of technology from the shale industry, like
polycrystalline diamond compact drillbits and using them on the harder
granite that Fervo drills. “Taking something that unlocked the shale
revolution and making it work for hard rock was our whole thesis,”
Latimer said. And there’s just been the steady improvements that come
through experience and automation. Latimer described how they figured
out a standardized, automated way to pick up and set down the drill bit
so that the bit isn’t damaged when drilling starts up again.
</p>
<p>
“When we think about Fervo, a lot of the things we think about is not
[how to] narrowly cut costs for one well, but ‘how do we create a system
where you simplify well design and make its more standardized.’”
</p>
<p>
The idea is that there can be a “learning curve” with drilling
geothermal wells, dropping costs over time. “We think geothermal will be
on the end of that spectrum like solar or LEDs or battery that benefits
from a learning curve because we figured out a way to standardize,”
Latimer said. “Fervo is a learning curve company.”
</p>
<p>
These<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421517301027" target="_blank">
learning curves</a> haven’t
just<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/column-kemp-fracking-costs-idUSL5E8NB83Q20121211/" target="_blank">
been seen in fracking</a>, but famously in green energy as well,
especially standardized technology like
<a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(22)00410-X" target="_blank">solar
panels</a>, whose costs reductions consistently outpace expert
forecasts. On the flip side, other forms of emission-free power,
<a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-are-nuclear-power-construction" target="_blank">namely
nuclear power</a>, seem to
be<a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-are-nuclear-power-construction" target="_blank">
getting more expensive over time</a>.
</p>
<p>
Fervo has also been capturing attention — and dollars — across the green
energy community because of a specific type of power that enhanced
geothermal could provide: 24 hour generation.
</p>
<p>
Other forms of non-carbon-emitting energy, particularly solar and wind,
only generate power either at specific times or day (when it’s sunny) or
when the weather is a certain way (windy). With enough transmission and
batteries, these types of intermittent generation could power
substantially more of the grid than they do today, but they can’t do it
all
—<a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(18)30386-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2542435118303866%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#secsectitle0020" target="_blank">
at least while keeping costs under control</a>.
</p>
<p>
The need for 24/7 clean power has only been amplified by
the<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self">
Treasury Department’s proposed rules on green hydrogen</a>, which would
make hydrogen producers prove they’re using non-carbon-emitting energy
for their operations in order to qualify for subsidies.
</p>
<p>
Latimer said Fervo’s inbox “blew up” after the proposed rules went out.
“We’re every hydrogen tech’s favorite supplier now,” he said. But he
noted that Fervo’s appeal was by no means limited to green hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
“Round-the-clock reliable electricity that doesn’t come with carbon
emissions is not a hard sell, it just has to be a cost structure that
makes sense.”
</p>
<p>
Fervo’s work is especially attractive to technology companies, who have
long been pioneers in procuring green energy and are now interested in
being able to get it 24/7. Fervo’s Nevada projects are contracted to
provide
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/google-fervo-geothermal-project-creates-carbon-free-energy" target="_blank">power
to Google’s data centers</a> and other infrastructure throughout the
state.
</p>
<p>
While Latimer would not say what Fervo’s current costs are, he did say
that for it to be competitive, it would have to get down to around $100
per megawatt-hour, about where traditional geothermal — where
<a href="https://www.calpine.com/operations/power-operations/technologies/geothermal" target="_blank">steam
or very hot water</a> that’s already present underground is brought to
the surface — is
now.<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-launches-new-energy-earthshot-slash-cost-geothermal-power" target="_blank">
The Department of Energy’s goal is</a> to reduce enhanced geothermal
costs by around 90 percent to $45 per megawatt hour by 2025. “The
results show we’re on the path to already being able to provide economic
projects even at that market rate,” Latimer said.
</p>
<p>
And Fervo is continuing to get attention — and dollars — from the
federal government. The Department of Energy announced Tuesday that
Fervo was one of three companies — the other two being Chevron and
Mazama — that would
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-invests-60-million-expand-clean-renewable-geothermal-energy#:~:text=Fervo%20Energy%E2%80%94This%20pilot%20within,existing%20commercial%20geothermal%20power%20production." target="_blank">receive

id="democrats-republicans-hold-black-history-month-events-with-eye-on-november-election">Democrats,
Republicans Hold Black History Month Events With Eye on November
Election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Black History Month, often a time to recognize the
contributions of African Americans in U.S. history, was marked in the
nation’s capital this week with a focus on present divides and the
November election when Black turnout will be integral to the
outcome.</p>
<p>At the White House, the Biden administration on Tuesday hosted more
than two dozen family members of civil rights icons and major historical
figures for a gala celebrating Black history. Vice President Kamala
Harris made a surprise appearance where she praised the families and
recounted the administration’s commitment to Black communities.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Republicans held a reception in Washington’s U
Street neighborhood, a key part of Black history in the city, to
celebrate former GOP (Republican) officials and activists who have
engaged Black voters.</p>
<p>The White House has taken Black History Month as an opportunity to
highlight the administration’s efforts on priorities such as education,
voting rights and jobs. Republicans see a chance to win more votes from
a core Democratic constituency, noting President Joe Biden’s lower
popularity with Black adults and the criticism he has taken for
inflation and his handling of the border.</p>
<p>Biden’s approval rating among Black adults was 42% in a January poll
by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, a
substantial drop from the first year of his presidency.</p>
<p>Democrats are spotlighting Biden’s support with civil rights
stalwarts and lambasting Republicans for enacting policies restricting
how educators discuss race and history in the classroom.</p>
<p>“We know that those who don’t remember their history are doomed to
repeat it,” said Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell, to the families assembled
at the White House. Sewell represents Selma, Alabama, where white police
beat Black civil rights marchers in 1965 on a day remembered today as
“Bloody Sunday.”</p>
<p>“At a time when extremists seek to erase our history and roll back
our progress, we should take a lesson from our foremothers and
forefathers,” she said.</p>
<p>Republicans held their own Black History Month celebration later that
evening with about 100 people.</p>
<p>“As RNC Chair, I have made it a mission to reach out to communities
and voters that we have ignored as a party,” said Republican National
Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel during Tuesday night’s event. “Black
voters are going to make history this November because they’re going to
vote Republican at the highest level we’ve ever seen,” McDaniel
predicted to applause from the audience.</p>
<p>The RNC intends to expand its number of community outreach centers in
Black communities after the GOP primary concludes. The party has been
optimistic about its chances to improve its poor margins with Black
voters since Republicans made slight inroads with them in the 2022
midterm elections.</p>
<p>But the party’s current focus on issues like the teaching of race and
history may risk mobilizing Black voters against the GOP. Republican
officials in at least a dozen states have enacted policies that regulate
how educators discuss topics including race, history and gender in the
classroom.</p>
<p>“This moment in time is evidence that our history is unbannable, that
teaching it is core to our progress, and that Black history is American
history,” Nevada Rep. Steve Horsford, chair of the Congressional Black
Caucus, told the White House crowd.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign dismissed GOP Black voter outreach as insincere
and noted that former President Donald Trump, the current front-runner
for the GOP nomination, had dinner in 2022 with Nick Fuentes, a
Holocaust-denying white nationalist.</p>
<p>“In Donald Trump’s Republican Party, celebrating Black History Month
means teaching kids that slavery benefited Black people, papering over
slavery as the cause of the Civil War and sharing well-done steaks
doused in ketchup with white supremacists at Mar-a-Lago,” said Biden
campaign communications director Michael Tyler. “I’m sure they’ll serve
up plenty of the same at their little event.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Biden campaign rolled out new ads targeting Black
voters by highlighting the administration’s investments in historically
Black colleges and universities as well as the number of Black
officeholders appointed by Biden, including Harris, Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. And the
Democratic National Committee on Wednesday unveiled digital ads
targeting HBCUs in battleground states that touts Biden’s record on
student debt.</p>
<p>Democrats point to record-low Black unemployment, policies capping
the cost of insulin and Biden’s cancellation of about $137 billion in
student loan debt as policies they hope will boost support among Black
voters. And party officials and strategists stress that its emphasis on
Black voters extends beyond a single month of events.</p>
<p>Biden also moved to increase Black political power when he upended
precedent to place South Carolina and its substantial Black population
first in the party’s primary calendar. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn,
a veteran of the Civil Rights movement and a close Biden ally, co-chairs
the president’s reelection campaign.</p>
<p>According to some of the assembled Republican activists on Tuesday
night, many of whom are Black, the GOP simply lacked the sustained
efforts needed to court more Black voters. Quenton Jordan, a Republican
activist who won an award at the event, said that the GOP is now
“putting forth an effort to capture the Black vote where in previous
years, that just wasn’t the case.”</p>
<p>“I remember when we had a greater pool,” said Ken Blackwell, a former
Ohio Republican secretary of state who received an award at the
reception. “That’s why this is important. To reengage, to give our
narrative and give them a choice. But first, we’ve got to show up.”</p>

Person Killed, Children Among 22 Shot at Kansas City Super Bowl
Parade</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>kansas city, missouri — Eight children were among 22 people hit by
gunfire in a shooting at the end of Wednesday’s parade to celebrate the
Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl win, authorities said. One person was
killed, identified by her radio station as a DJ. </p>
<p>Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves detailed the shooting’s toll
at a news conference and said three people had been taken into
custody. </p>
<p>“I’m angry at what happened today. The people who came to this
celebration should expect a safe environment,” Graves said. Police did
not immediately release details about the people taken into custody or
about a possible motive for the shootings. She said firearms had been
recovered, but not what kind of weapons were used. </p>
<p>“There’s a lot of work ahead. This is just the beginning stages,” she
said. “All of that is being actively investigated.” </p>
<p>It was the latest sports celebration in the U.S. to be marred by gun
violence. A shooting injured several people last year in downtown Denver
after the Nuggets’ NBA championship, and gunfire erupted last year at a
parking lot near the Texas Rangers’ World Series championship
parade. </p>
<p>Radio station KKFI said in a Facebook post Wednesday evening that DJ
Lisa Lopez, host of “Taste of Tejano,” was killed in the shooting. </p>
<p>“This senseless act has taken a beautiful person from her family and
this KC community,” KKFI said in a statement. </p>
<p>The shooting outside Union Station happened despite more than 800
police officers who were in the building and around the area, including
on top of nearby buildings, said Mayor Quinton Lucas, who attended with
his wife and mother and had to run for cover when gunfire broke
out. </p>
<p>“I think that’s something that all of us who are parents, who are
just regular people living each day, have to decide what we wish to do
about,” Lucas said. “Parades, rallies, schools, movies. It seems like
almost nothing is safe.” </p>
<p>Kansas City has long struggled with gun violence, and in 2020 it was
among nine cities targeted by the U.S. Justice Department in an effort
to crack down on violent crime. In 2023 the city matched a record with
182 homicides, most of which involved guns. </p>
<p>Lucas has joined with mayors across the country in calling for new
laws to reduce gun violence, including mandating universal background
checks. </p>
<p>Lisa Money, a resident of the city, was trying to gather some
confetti near the end of the parade when she heard somebody yell, “Down,
down, everybody down!” </p>
<p>At first Money thought somebody might be joking. Then she saw a SWAT
team jumping over a nearby fence. </p>
<p>“I can’t believe it really happened. Who in their right mind would do
something like this? This is supposed to be a day of celebration for
everybody in the city and the surrounding area,” she said. </p>
<p>Kevin Sanders, 53, of Lenexa, Kansas, said he heard what sounded like
firecrackers and then people started running. After that initial flurry,
calm returned, and he didn’t think much of it. But 10 minutes later,
ambulances started showing up. </p>
<p>University Health spokeswoman Nancy Lewis said the hospital was
treating eight gunshot victims. Two were in critical condition and six
were in stable condition, she said. The hospital also was treating four
people for other injuries resulting from the chaos after the shooting,
Lewis said. </p>
<p>Lisa Augustine, spokesperson for Children’s Mercy Kansas City, said
the hospital was treating 12 patients from the rally, including 11
children, some of whom suffered gunshot wounds. </p>
<p>St. Luke’s Hospital of Kansas City received one gunshot patient in
critical condition and three walk-ins with injuries that were not
life-threatening, spokesperson Laurel Gifford said. </p>
<p>Chiefs trainer Rick Burkholder said that he was with coach Andy Reid
and other coaches and staff members at the time of the shooting, and
that the team was on buses and returning to Arrowhead Stadium. </p>
<p>“We are truly saddened by the senseless act of violence that occurred
outside of Union Station at the conclusion of today’s parade and rally,”
the team said in a statement. </p>
<p>Missouri’s Republican Governor Mike Parson and first lady Teresa
Parson were at the parade during the gunfire but were unhurt. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting and will continue to
receive updates, a White House spokesperson said. White House officials
were in touch with state and local leaders, and federal law enforcement
was on the scene supporting local counterparts.</p>

<h2 id="key-us-lawmaker-warns-of-serious-national-security-threat">Key
US Lawmaker Warns of ‘Serious National Security Threat’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — A top U.S. lawmaker is sounding an alarm about a
potentially significant threat to the country’s security, publicly
calling on President Joe Biden to declassify intelligence so that the
American public and its allies can formulate a response. </p>
<p>The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Republican
Representative Mike Turner, issued a statement Tuesday warning of a
“serious national security threat.” </p>
<p>Turner’s statement did not elaborate on the threat, but noted he has
requested that the president share the information more quickly and more
widely. </p>
<p>A copy of an email Turner reportedly sent to colleagues, shared on
social media by various news outlets, described the danger as a “foreign
military destabilizing capability.”  </p>
<p>Still, the White House on Wednesday sought to downplay Turner’s
concerns. </p>
<p>“I’m confident that President Biden, in the decisions that he is
taking, is going to ensure the security of the American people going
forward,” said White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. </p>
<p>“We believe that we can and will and are protecting the national
security of the United States,” Sullivan told reporters, adding he was
surprised that Turner took his concerns public since they were scheduled
to meet for a classified briefing Thursday. </p>
<p>Sullivan also defended the decision not to make the threat
intelligence public, pointing both to concerns about protecting U.S.
“sources and methods,” and the president’s willingness to declassify
intelligence in the past. </p>
<p>“You definitely are not going to find an unwillingness to do that
when it’s in our national security interests to do so,” he said. “This
administration has gone further and, in more creative, more strategic
ways, dealt with the declassification of intelligence in the national
interest of the United States than any administration in history.” </p>
<p>Some key lawmakers also pushed back. </p>
<p>The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes,
called the threat “a significant one” but “not a cause for panic.”</p>
<p>“As to whether more can be declassified about this issue, that is a
worthwhile discussion,” he added. “But it is not a discussion to be had
in public.” </p>
<p>The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee likewise sought to
allay concerns.</p>
<p>The committee “has the intelligence in question and has been
rigorously tracking this issue from the start,” Democratic Chairman Mark
Warner and Republican Vice Chairman Marco Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We continue to take this matter seriously and are discussing an
appropriate response with the administration,” they added. “In the
meantime, we must be cautious about potentially disclosing sources and
methods that may be key to preserving a range of options for U.S.
action.”</p>
<p>Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson separately told reporters
multiple times there is “no need for public alarm.”</p>
<p>“I want to assure the American people,” Johnson said. “We just want
to assure everyone steady hands are at the wheel. We’re working on it
and there’s no need for alarm.” </p>
<p>VOA’s Katherine Gypson conributed to this report.</p>

Because it doesn’t have tailpipe emissions that can harm people and
contaminate the air in enclosed spaces, electric equipment has the
ability to get work done where the cost of conventional diesel or
propane can’t be justified. In this case, we’re not talking about
financial cost, but <em>cultural</em> cost – in this case, at the
St. Jerome Monumental Complex in Naples, where Bobcat is putting its
E10e electric mini excavator to work exploring the historic landmark.

It has been a catastrophic 12 months for offshore wind in the United
States. Several large projects have been canceled along the
Mid-Atlantic, and Orsted, the world’s largest offshore wind developer,
has laid off hundreds of employees and canceled its dividend. Is the
industry dying?<br/>

Here’s an excerpt of our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Make a case to me about why offshore
wind … like 2023 was the catastrophic year for offshore wind, and now
it’s going to come back.<br/> <strong><br/> Jesse Jenkins:</strong>
Yeah, that’s a great question. <br/> <br/> I mean, I think it is worth
pausing and noting that offshore wind in the United States was already
pretty expensive, and is now even more expensive. So I think the
contracts that New Jersey signed, for example, which are 20-year,
basically fixed price contracts — they got to go up at 2% per year,
which is what we thought inflation would be, but now is maybe not where
it will be over the next few years, but basically fixed long term
contracts — were in the $80 to $90 per megawatt-hour range, which itself
is roughly double the wholesale electricity cost in the region. So we’re
basically paying for twice as much for wind energy as we would pay for
natural gas or coal fired power in the regional electricity mix. And
that’s after a federal subsidy knocks off 30% of the upfront cost.<br/>
<br/> That sounds like a lot, right? And I think it’s fair to say that
the costs that are going to be signed in the new auctions that are
happening now are going to be up or above $100 per megawatt hour. So,
just the interest rates alone … You know, the Fed raised interest rates
by over 5% from March 2022 to August 2023. That 5 percentage point
increase in the cost of capital would raise the levelized cost, or
average cost of electricity alone, by about a third for any of these
projects. So it’s a huge cost escalator. And of course, the underlying
cost of building the projects went up by about 65%. That’s way faster,
about three times faster than consumer goods went up. We all know about
how much more expensive it is to buy milk or bread or fill up at the gas
pump. So, that’s the case for seeing this as, you know, the bear case —
that these projects are now really expensive, and maybe they’re more
expensive than we’re willing to pay.<br/> <br/> On the other hand, I
think there’s three reasons that, basically every state is still
committed to building out offshore wind despite those cost increases.
One is that is an historic, once in a generation macro inflationary
cycle, a global pandemic with all of the supply chain disruptions that
came with that, followed by a war in Europe and all of the impacts on
energy costs that that brought about, you know, etc., these are really
unique circumstances. And so those should be behind us, right? <br/>
<br/> Hopefully we can then get back on a trajectory of building out
this new industry across the region, including the supply chains and the
expertise in the transmission infrastructure undersea, to bring the wind
onshore. That will steadily drive down the cost. And the reason to be
optimistic about that is we have seen that in Europe, right? The wind
industry did follow a very significant cost decline trajectory over the
15 years or so from its birth to now, in Europe. And we’re just going to
have to pay a lot of those costs here because that learning and the
experience in the infrastructure and the workforce isn’t really
translatable.<br/> <br/> The second reason is just there’s not a lot of
alternatives for these states. Yes, electricity is structurally more
expensive in Europe. It’s also structurally more expensive all along the
eastern coast because we have high population density, population
centers. There’s … these are very dense populated centers close to the
coast, without access to the really good wind and solar resources that
we see in the U.S. interior or the West. And so what are we going to do?
Are we going to continue to burn fossil fuels? That would be the
cheapest thing to do in the near term, but of course has lots of long
term implications, including accelerating climate change. And all of
these states have committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels.
Virginia, New Jersey, York, Massachusetts, etc. have these 100% clean
energy commitments.

<em>This is a transcript of episode two of Shift Key: Has Offshore Wind
Finally Hit Rock Bottom?</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Hi, I’m Rob Meyer. I’m the founding
executive editor of Heatmap News, and you are listening to Shift Key, a
new podcast about climate change and the shift away from fossil fuels
from Heatmap. My co-host, Jenkins: will join us in a second and we’ll
get on with the show. But first, a word from our sponsor.
</p>
<p>
[AD BREAK]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Hello, my name is Robinson Meyer. I’m the
founding executive editor of Heatmap News.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>And I’m Jesse Jenkins, a professor at
Princeton University and an expert in energy systems and climate policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And you are listening to Shift Key, a new
podcast about climate change and the shift away from fossil fuels, from
Heatmap News. On today’s episode, we’re going to talk about what exactly
is happening in the offshore wind industry. Is it hurt? Is it dying? Is
it —has
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Has it hit rock bottom?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Has it hit rock bottom? Is it very depressed?
What’s happening? And of course, we’ll share our upshifts and downshifts
from the week, and I will get better at pronouncing it.
</p>
<p>
Let’s get into it. Jesse, last year was, I think it’s fair to say, a
pretty catastrophic year for offshore wind, especially in the United
States. That was capped last week when Orsted, which is the world’s
largest offshore wind developer, announced that it was cutting 800 jobs,
a little less than 10% of its workforce, and suspending its dividend —
it’s not going to pay anything to investors — and it was also exiting
from a number of European markets, including Norway, Portugal and Spain.
And not only that, but it has cut down its kind of internal target for
how much offshore wind it wants to build by 2030. It had once hoped to
build 50 gigawatts. Now it’s going to go closer to 35 to 38. And what’s
interesting is that Orsted, you know, not profitable last year. But that
was like, entirely driven by the U.S. So it would have made $2 billion
in profit last year, but it took $5 billion in impairment charges — like
it would have been profitable, except for its U.S. business. And its
U.S. business took it as a firm from like $2 billion in the black to $3
billion in the red.
</p>
<p>
So, Jesse, let’s just start with, I think, getting listeners up to
speed. What projects did Orsted cancel in the United States last year?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yes. So they actually canceled several, most
recently, a pair of projects that had sold contracts to Maryland. That
followed a pair of projects in New Jersey, and another that would serve
New York State. So I think it’s five projects in total and a couple
phases of the same project in New Jersey. And those projects all were
under long term contracts with state entities. And we’ll talk a lot more
about the role of the states in driving the offshore wind industry here
in the Atlantic states, but they basically sign long term, you know,
purchase agreements with the states to buy power at a fixed price with,
you know, a set escalation schedule. And they did that many years ago
or, you know, before the pandemic, before the significant surge in
inflation, the cost of goods that rose over the last few years — and
then, just as importantly, before the increase in interest rates that
the Federal Reserve used to try to combat that inflation.
</p>
<p>
And so you combine those two things, and it’s really a double whammy.
The cost of cement and steel and concrete and labor and all of the
specialty equipment they need to build these offshore wind projects is
skyrocketing at the exact same time that the finance costs, the mortgage
they have to take out to build these projects, is going up. And all that
meant that they couldn’t honor their contracts and that, you know, it’s
notable that they pulled out because in each of these cases, they had to
incur several hundred million dollars of penalties for voiding the
contracts with the state. So it’s not just the money they sunk into the
projects that may not be complete, but it’s also very significant
financial penalties for walking away.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And how did they explain why they needed to …
What did they blame?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>I think it’s three issues that they have
consistently pointed to. We talked about two already. One is the cost of
goods and labor, going up with inflation. The second is interest rates,
which have a huge impact on these projects. They’re almost all upfront
cost, right, with some operation and maintenance over time, but no fuel
costs. So once you get these wind farms up and running, they’re more or
less free. But you got to take out a big mortgage, right? Just like you
do when you buy a house. And you got to pay that back over time. And so
the interest rate that you strike for those financing costs is a big
determinant of how much you can afford to sell your power at and still
make a profit.
</p>
<p>
And then the third factor is a peculiar one, which is the absence of
very specialized ships that are used to install these giant wind
turbines. And they really don’t exist in the U.S. because we’re just
starting to build our industry here. The industry in Europe that has
been, you know, going for several decades in the North Sea has a number
of these vessels, you know, they’re in use there. We could bring them
here, but we have this law called the Jones Act, which requires any
vessel that is leaving a U.S. port for another U.S. destination to be a
U.S. built and U.S. crewed ship, and we just don’t have any of those
yet. There’s one coming soon. But that is a real challenge logistically
for any of these projects.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And let’s just, I think, as a final point,
before we go into the discussion further, why is offshore wind, like,
important at all? Why, as people who want to solve climate change,
should we care at all about how specific offshore wind projects off the
coast of New Jersey or Maryland or Rhode Island are going?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I think for I mean, a couple reasons.
One is that this is a big new industry that we’re trying to kind of give
birth to in the region. These were some of the first large scale wind
farms. Every 3,000 megawatts of wind power out there is roughly enough
to supply the annual electricity needs of about a million households. So
that’s a big sized city just in New York State alone, projects that were
canceled by Orsted and Equinor totaled about 3 GW. So that’s enough
energy for like, Queens, you know, one of the entire boroughs, right? So
these are big deals in terms of the amount of supply they’re going to
provide and the the local economic impact.
</p>
<p>
And so I think for the region at least — I mean, if you’re in Wyoming,
you probably don’t care too much about what’s going on in the Atlantic.
But all up and down the East Coast from North Carolina to Maine, states
have made a real significant commitment to offshore wind, to be a major
contributor to their local electricity mix and help them meet clean
energy and climate goals. And, you know, and their megaprojects are big,
you know, large-scale efforts, billion-dollar projects, you know,
millions of households worth of energy and lots of jobs and local
economic investment. And so when a project like that fails, you know,
it’s kind of a big deal for the local economy, for the politics around
it, for our progress towards our clean energy goals. And it’s a
potential setback in our clean energy transition.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> There’s also — It’s economically important, but
there’s also technical, I think what an electricity engineer would call
resource related reasons why we want offshore wind. Is this right? Like
it fits into the grid in a very useful way. Am I wrong about this?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, actually, I was just teaching a lecture
on wind power to my students today, and we took a look at the Global
Wind Atlas, which we can drop in the show notes. And what you can really
see quite clearly is that the onshore wind potential in the Atlantic
area is really quite poor. We don’t really have good locations to build
wind power in Virginia or New York, near the coast at least, or in New
Jersey at all. But the wind resource offshore is very good.
</p>
<p>
Wind speeds, you know, can move across the ocean. It’s very flat.
There’s nothing that gets in the way. And you get a lot of frequent,
wind patterns driven by the difference in temperature between the ocean
and the land. So there’s all these localized effects that tend to
produce a lot of energy in the morning, in the evening and overnight
when it’s cooling off. And these are nice complements to solar power
that produces mostly during the day. And you know, you can’t run your
entire grid on one variable renewable resource, or even two. But having
offshore wind complementary, you know, which is complementary to solar,
and also to sometimes onshore wind patterns further inland that, you
know, are separated from the ocean can really help you smooth out the
variability that you have to deal with, make it easier for energy
storage and, and flexible demand and more dispatchable generators to
kind of fill in the gaps around it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
And there’s just really not a lot of other options in these states.
Like, you know, if you want to have economic development and meet your
clean energy goals with resources in your state, there’s just not a lot
of other options. You can, you know, build solar, you can build nuclear
power plants, or you can do offshore wind. Those are kind of your
options for the Atlantic states, at least those without, you know, the
large interior territories that New York has.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> So I want to come back to some of the like
resource questions in a second. I will say, this is all very interesting
— well, let me think about how I want to pitch this. I understand
offshore wind being technically important, right? I understand how it
fits into the solar mix. I understand it’s good economic development.
</p>
<p>
I found last year to be fairly … I wouldn’t say radicalizing, but I will
say I kind of came out of last year being like, I don’t know if I see it
anymore. Like I did start to feel like, man, is offshore wind more of a
like, is it going to succeed exclusively in Europe and China, where
there is more willingness to have a working coast, where electricity,
especially in Europe, is just structurally more expensive? And so this
technique, this way of generating electricity, kind of fits into their
mix better. And so, what I’m going to ask you to do is just argue to me,
like make a case for why that’s wrong. Make a case to me about why
offshore wind … like 2023 was the catastrophic year for offshore wind,
and now it’s going to come back.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, that’s a great question. I mean, I think
it is worth pausing and noting that offshore wind in the United States
was already pretty expensive, and is now even more expensive. So I think
the contracts that New Jersey signed, for example, which are 20-year,
you know, basically fixed price contracts — they got to go up at 2% per
year, which is, you know, what we thought inflation would be, but now is
maybe not where it will be over the next few years, but basically fixed
long term contracts — were in the $80 to $90 per megawatt-hour range,
which itself is roughly double the wholesale electricity cost in the
region. So we’re, you know, we’re basically paying for, you know, twice
as much for wind energy as we would pay for natural gas or coal fired
power in the regional electricity mix. And that’s after a federal
subsidy knocks off 30% of the upfront cost.
</p>
<p>
That sounds like a lot, right? And I think it’s fair to say that the
costs that are going to be signed in the new auctions that are happening
now are going to be up or above $100 per megawatt hour. So, you know,
they, you know, just the interest rates alone. You know, the Fed raised
interest rates by over 5% from March 2022 to August 2023. That 5
percentage point increase in the cost of capital would raise the
levelized cost, or average cost of electricity alone, by about a third
for any of these projects. So it’s a huge cost escalator. And of course,
the underlying cost of building the projects went up by about 65%.
That’s way faster, about three times faster than consumer goods went up.
So, you know, we all know about how much more expensive it is to buy
milk or bread or fill up at the gas pump. So, you know, that’s the case
for seeing this as, you know, the bear case — that these projects are
now really expensive, and maybe they’re more expensive than we’re
willing to pay.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, I think there’s three reasons that, basically every
state is still committed to building out offshore wind despite those
cost increases. One is that is a, you know, a historic, once in a
generation macro inflationary cycle, a global pandemic with all of the
supply chain disruptions that came with that, followed by a war in
Europe and all of the impacts on energy costs that that, you know,
brought about, you know, etc., these are really unique circumstances.
You know, and so those should be behind us, right? Hopefully we can then
get back on a trajectory of building out this new industry across the
region, including the supply chains and the expertise in the
transmission infrastructure undersea, to bring the wind onshore. That
will steadily drive down the cost. And the reason to be optimistic about
that is we have seen that in Europe, right? The wind industry did follow
a very significant cost decline trajectory over the, you know, 15 years
or so from its birth to now, in Europe. And we’re just going to have to
pay a lot of those costs here because that learning and the experience
in the infrastructure and the workforce isn’t really translatable.
</p>
<p>
The second reason is just there’s not a lot of alternatives for these
states. You know, yes, electricity is structurally more expensive in
Europe. It’s also structurally more expensive all along the eastern
coast because we have high population density, population centers.
There’s … these are very dense populated centers close to the coast,
without access to the really good wind and solar resources that we see
in the U.S. interior or the West. And so what are we going to do? Are we
going to continue to burn fossil fuels? That would be the cheapest thing
to do in the near term, but of course has lots of long term
implications, including accelerating climate change. And all of these
states have committed to transitioning away from fossil fuels. Virginia,
New Jersey, York, Massachusetts, etc. have these 100% clean energy
commitments.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Assuming those states have this durable interest
in decarbonization, in some ways, like, offshore wind has to have hit
rock bottom, is part of what I’m hearing. Because there are just no
other options. So they could go through this tear-your-hair out
frustration loop, where they go try to build more solar, and then they
go try to build more nuclear, and maybe those don’t work, so then they
find themselves back where they began with offshore wind. But like, even
with that, they’re still going to need offshore wind. So can you just
get us up to speed on, like, what’s the good news in offshore wind, I
guess?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah. And I think this is the evidence that
the states are going to stay committed and are moving forward, and that
we probably have hit rock bottom. So, you know, yes, the news in
November and December and early January was dominated by all these
cancellations. And it wasn’t just Orsted. There were others up and down
the Atlantic coast. But if we look at just, you know, New York and New
Jersey, there’s similar stories in other states. You know, New York
State has a goal of building 9,000 MW or 9 GW of offshore wind by 2035.
Again, that’s about enough, to power 3 million households. So they had a
third-round contract towards the end of last year. At that point, they
had contracted for about 8.3 of those 9 GW, so they were kind of almost
there. Then we had these cancellations: Orsted’s, Sunrise Wind and
Equinor’s Empire I and II that lost about 3 GW of that. So now they’re
back to about 5 GW of the nine. New York just closed another accelerated
auction. And if that, you know, contracts another roughly 3 or 4 GW,
like the last round, that would get them their full pipeline of nine
gigawatts of projects. And again, they have until 2035 to bring those
online. So it’s sort of like, you know, three steps forward, two steps
back in the near term here, but they’re continuing to move forward. We
could still hit those goals.
</p>
<p>
What’s going to happen is that the buildout trajectory is going to get
pushed back by a couple of years, and even some of those canceled
projects could have a second lease on life because they are going to be
rebid into these subsequent auctions. And we think we saw that,
actually, with Orsted re-bidding one of their projects into New York’s
recent auction in January, and we don’t know if they’ll win that round
of auction. They have to beat out other competitive bids from other
developers. That’s good. They tried to get New York to just single, to
bilaterally renegotiate their existing contract and give them more
money. And New York and New Jersey, you know, basically, and
Massachusetts, all said no to those requests from developers. They said,
look, a contract’s not worth anything if we sign it and you agree to a
price and then you come back later and ask for more money. So if you
want more money, you’re going to have to go out and, you know, pay the
fine for not honor your contract and then rebid, and, and beat out
everybody else. And if you can’t beat everybody else, that’s not in the
interest of the state. So they really held the line against all of the
requests from the developers to try to, you know, inflate their
contracts. But some of those projects will come back in this next round.
We’ll just come back at a higher price and probably a couple of years
delayed.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Let’s zoom out for a second. So we’ve been
talking about the Atlantic a lot, partially I think, because you and I,
listeners will discover, have a shared interest in New Jersey.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> That’s right.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Me, having grown up in New Jersey and you
currently living in New Jersey. Let’s zoom out from New Jersey for a
second. Much of the Atlantic coast is not a working shoreline in, I
think, ways that parts of, say, Northern Europe are a working shoreline.
But we do have working shoreline in the country. And that’s not to say
that like people on the coast don’t work. It’s just like.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>It’s a lot of tourism.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>It’s a lot of tourism. It’s a very tourism
dependent industry. And so anything like these wind farms, they’re going
to be close enough to be seen from the shore. They were not going to be
very big, but they were going to be close enough to be seen from the
shore. And you really, when you’re there, you don’t see a lot of other
light industrial activities from the shore. We do have a working
coastline in the U.S., though. It’s the Gulf Coast. And so why are we
not like filling the Gulf Coast with offshore wind farms?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>There’s really two main reasons why that
didn’t happen. One is physics and the second is politics — I think we’ll
keep coming back to those two as consistent themes in the show, physics
and politics. But the first is just that, unlike the Jersey Shore or New
York, you know, coastline or Virginia, where we really don’t have good
wind resources onshore, Texas has an incredible wind resource onshore,
including even the coastal regions quite close to the shoreline. And
also the Gulf Coast, wind speeds are not as high, although it does
suffer hurricanes. The average wind speeds are not as consistently high
as they are in the Atlantic because it is a gulf. It’s, you know, it’s
not a big open expanse of ocean the way the Atlantic is. And so the
dominant wind patterns are not quite so strong. So the differential, the
sort of benefit that you get from going offshore is really quite modest,
if anything, in the Gulf versus a good onshore wind site. And of course,
anytime you’re building in a marine environment where you have to deal
with the corrosive nature of the ocean and the damaging destruction of
storms and the cost of servicing and equipping, and, you know, working
on wind farms and deep offshore, that’s going to be a lot more
expensive. So unless you’re getting a lot more energy out of that
project than you would on land, it just simply doesn’t make sense to
build offshore. So that’s the kind of physics and economics.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the second reason — we talked already about the commitment to
decarbonization that all of those states in the Atlantic exhibit, which
is really driving the ship, so to speak. Texas, clearly, Mississippi,
Louisiana, they clearly don’t have the same kind of commitment, at least
at this point, to those goals. And we should say that’s really important
because the Inflation Reduction Act provides significant long term tax
credits for offshore wind and solar and, you know, onshore wind and all
kinds of other clean electricity sources. And while those tax credits
have been enough to make solar and wind onshore quite economically
attractive in deep red states, right — you know, Kansas, Oklahoma,
Texas, all over the place are building huge amounts of onshore wind and
solar just based on the economics, not because of their climate or green
credentials — that’s just not true for offshore wind. The tax credits
alone, again, they still leave offshore wind about twice the cost of
wholesale energy. And so they’re just not going to move forward without
a state level commitment. And that’s really lacking in the Gulf Coast
region as well.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> That’s really interesting.
</p>
<p>
[AD BREAK]
</p>
<p>
So I want to ask — there’s like a point that keeps coming up again and
again here that is, like, the states play a major role. And I do think
this is interesting. From a larger policy like to kind of zoom out a bit
and kind of look at this as a policy question. Normally when we think
about states playing a role in climate policy, there’s like one jewel,
there’s like one big star when we talk about state level climate policy,
and that’s California. And that’s because California, and this is not
where, I’m not talking about the electricity system here. I’m talking
about kind of the whole emissions picture. California has a special
carve out under the law, under the Clean Air Act — like it’s written
into the text that Congress passed, that California can set higher
standards for certain pollutants than the rest of the country, and that
any other state can join into its standards. And California does do that
for a number of pollutants, including right now for carbon dioxide. I
think right now about 13, 12 or 13 states sign on to its standards.
</p>
<p>
But other than that, other than California having these special powers
to, like, regulate the vehicle fleet and various other things, we don’t
talk about — at least I don’t think about states as being major players
at the level of shaping what their resource mix looks like. Is that
because I, is that because I just don’t know things? Or is that like, is
that because I’m ignorant? Or is that because there is something kind of
unique and interesting about offshore wind, or maybe unique and
interesting about where state’s decarbonization goals are going to have
to take governments?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> I think in some ways it’s sort of a back to
the future kind of thing. Yeah, I guess it changes who’s, like, who’s in
the driver’s seat, right? Historically, we had vertically integrated
monopoly utilities, and in much of the country that’s still the case,
like in the Southeast and much of the West. But in about, you know, 60%
of the country, fairly recently, like around 2000, in early 2000s, we
basically restructured the markets to say, you know what, for at least
generation and wholesale large power plants, and maybe also for retail
sales, like who signs you up as a customer and, you know, does your
billing and provide some other services, we’re going to open that part
of it up to competition, and we’ll keep the wires part the network
utility because that makes sense. But we’ll let the generators all
compete with each other. And now the market is in the driver’s seat. And
what does the market build an enormous amount of natural gas.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> I was gonna say, the market the market falls
over itself to build natural gas. Yeah. The market goes to sleep and
wakes up, and it’s just surrounded by extra natural gas plants that it
made while it was sleeping.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah. And bankruptcies.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> And bankruptcies. Yes. Exactly. Yeah.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>So the wisdom of the market overbuilt a huge
amount of gas in an attempt to get regulated utilities for to stop
overbuilding a huge amount of nuclear and coal plants. That’s a cycle we
went through. And then states, again, around similar times, like, start
to get more and more concerned about climate change and clean energy and
reducing their exposure to what, at that point, we talked about in the
last episode, were increasing natural gas prices right in the early, in
the mid 2000s. And they say, you know what, we should actually take a
little bit more of a hand here and shape how the market works. And they
still did it in a relatively hands off way through what are known as
renewable portfolio standards.
</p>
<p>
So these are basically laws that say to the utility, okay, you get to,
you know, the market can shape the mix, but you have to buy a certain
amount of your electricity from clean resources or a certain qualifying
renewable resources. But you decide: offshore wind, onshore wind, solar,
whatever. And then what changed, really, is these resource-specific
procurements that we’re now seeing. And wind is the most salient, but
also we’re seeing procurements of utility-scale solar in certain states.
</p>
<p>
And actually, I think the most, the most interesting one is, is the
recent law passed in North Carolina by the legislature, which is
basically like a resource plan in law. You know, build this many
megawatts of this shut down this many megawatts of coal, build these
many megawatts of offshore wind, 50% of that the utility gets to own,
this much has to go to market. It’s like the legislature taking the
driver’s seat now and writing through law what they want the resource
mix to look like. And that’s, I think, the thing that has shifted,
right. It’s the legislature driving resource procurement. And that is,
that is new.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And I think there is, like, a “Just when I got
out, they pulled me back in” aspect to all of this, I think. Where, it
seemed like, for reasons having to do with broader ideas floating around
about how markets were smart and how what often seemed like the very
corrupt nature of the kind of state regulatory and monopoly utility
interface that these, you know, the states were very corrupted by the
utilities, the utilities were very corrupted by the state. But I guess
what I’m saying is that there was this move toward markets, and that
since then, and then even with the RPS, as you said, there’s still this
kind of market technology neutral, well, we’re open to all kinds of
portfolios. And what we’re discovering is for reasons that mostly, I
think have to do with physics, you wind up — states kind of wound up
right back where they started, where it’s like, okay, well, now we’re
actually. it’s just easier if we plan this.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> I do think there’s still I mean, I think
there’s some of that, I think. I think there’s a lot more politics going
on here. I would shade into the story.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> By all means, yes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yes. There is some local opposition to
offshore wind. There is a lot of economic, salience or political
salience to being able to say to some of the working shoreline
communities — which we did have long ago, right? And being able to go
there and say, we’re going to build a $500 million revitalization of the
port of New Bedford in Massachusetts or New London in Connecticut or
Staten Island in New York or Brooklyn, where they’re building these
terminals and drive a huge amount of employment and investment and
revitalization in these communities. That’s why the politics of offshore
wind is so attractive.
</p>
<p>
Also, because the components are so big and because the state is shaping
it, they can add these riders about local benefits in manufacturing. A
lot of the manufactured components for these turbines are also coming
from the area. So there’s the steel piles you have to drive into the
ground, called monopiles. The towers, the blades, the turbines, they’re
all getting built in New York and New Jersey and Virginia and elsewhere,
and creating manufacturing jobs in communities that were previously
depressed. And, you know, politicians can go to ribbon cuttings and
point to their legislation and say, we did this right.
</p>
<p>
So I think that’s a big piece of why the legislatures are so attracted
to offshore wind, is it does create a lot of jobs and a lot of
investment and a lot of local manufacturing activity. And I think that’s
part of why the legislature has basically decided we’re willing to pay a
lot more for offshore wind than we would be for, say, a transmission
line to wind in a state inland is that it might be a lot cheaper.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Is that a good thing? I mean, I guess I just —
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I don’t you —
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>You know me, like, I love industrial policy blah
blah blah. However, I will say when you look across the U.S. and you
look at projects that have been considered to be drivers of economic
development in a direct way instead of an indirect way, by which I mean,
like when you look at these big public projects where some of the stated
top line benefits of these projects are like, creates many jobs,
creates, helps three dozen small businesses. You don’t … it’s not
exactly a record that like covers itself in glory. Like, you know,
California high speed rail remains unbuilt. But the director, you know,
like people involved with California high speed rail, sometimes they’re
like, well, it’s actually been very successful because we’ve supported
all these jobs and we’ve supported all these businesses. And it’s like,
still, you know, this, all this economic activity. But of course, the
thing hasn’t been built yet, actually doing the thing that we wanted to
do, which is move people quickly from L.A. to San Francisco. Is it good
that we’re looking at that? Legislatures look at offshore wind and
they’re like, oh, look at all those jobs in it rather than like … yeah,
yeah.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah. I mean, let me go on the record and say,
I am not a fan of resource planning by the state legislatures. I mean, I
think that, you know, as a deliberative democracy, you know, democratic
body or representative body, right? They have a role in representing the
combined stakeholder interests. But, you know, when it comes to, when it
comes to making energy policy, we all know that there are certain
stakeholders who have a lot more access and a lot more influence in, you
know, state legislatures than others, and are likely to sort of shift
things in certain directions. And so what I have counseled — and I’ve
been asked to advise state legislatures and, and policymakers in a
number of contexts. And what I have advised is to say, look, you are
balancing real goals here, right there. There are several different
objectives we’re trying to achieve. Right? We want to reach a cleaner
energy mix because we’re trying to combat climate change and reduce air
pollution and improve environmental justice, and all those goals. So we
want a clean mix, but also, I’m sure we’ll do an episode on this later,
the electricity sector has to play a much bigger role in powering our
lives in a cleaner future, right?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Load must go up.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> Electric cars and other industries … Yeah,
yeah, there just has to be a lot more electricity generated, period, to
electrify so many different things, from EVs to heat pumps to industry.
Yeah. And if you do that, you know, not putting aside, you know, so that
even from the climate concern, you have to worry yourself about
affordability of this transition, as well. If you make electricity
prices two or three times more expensive, that’s going to make it a lot
harder to electrify all those industries. And it’s going to make, you
know, energy costs for low income and fixed income residents go up and,
you know, there’s justice implications of that. It’s going to make your
small businesses and competitive businesses or businesses and
competitive industries less competitive, you know, with other states. So
there’s an affordability concern that’s always front and center in these
conversations. And then there’s this economic development concern.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, state legislatures are historically interested in driving
economic investment and in development in their state. That’s a big part
of what they do. And so you’re balancing these three things, right. You
know, affordability, clean energy and climate goals and in-state
economic development. And I have simply recommended that you focus on
the ends and not the means. So if those are your goals, let’s write into
the law that you know, we’re going to have X percent clean energy and we
want y percentage of that to be in state because of economic development
goals. And we want to put a cost containment provision in here that says
we won’t build those offshore wind or those in-state projects if it
costs more than Z, because that’s how much we’re willing to pay for that
insane development. And then go let the utilities or a state agency
contract for whatever the cheapest way is to meet that goal, right, to
maintain your affordability goals. And maybe that’s offshore wind in
certain places, and maybe it’s not.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>I’m going to really mangle this concept because
it is not exactly creative to describe this, but there was a Hungarian
anthropologist and political economist named Karl Polanyi. It’s also a
name I’m probably not saying correctly. Yeah, I’m choosing to pronounce
his name like he’s a Chicago guy. Karl Polanyi, you know, down by
Wabash.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>He’s a good guy, he’s got the pizza shop.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>He, he, he has this idea of fictitious
commodities, which are kind of things that you have to treat as a
commodity to make the whole system work, to make the whole economy work,
but are not themselves commodities. They don’t really work like actual
commodities. And his big three examples are land, labor and money. He
was writing during the 1940s, but it feels like electricity is one of
them. I’m like, I’m, I’m adapting this idea to a situation that was not
designed to apply to, but it does feel kind of like to describe the
whole nature of how we think about electricity, which is this extremely
important thing that mostly remains kind of mired in technical
discussion, but nonetheless makes the whole world work.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, no that sounds about right. And I think
that describes sort of the pendulum swinging back and forth. And so, you
know, where I, where I do think we have opportunity here is to say,
look, we have public objectives. We can, we know that these are high
upfront cost, you know, capital intensive projects that once you build
them, are just going to produce cheap energy for a long period of time.
Right? Their marginal costs are low, and so the cost of capital is
really important, and the cost to build the project is really important.
Right. Those are the two determinants of how much a wind farm is going
to cost. So we can use long term public contracts to drive down the cost
of capital by basically guaranteeing revenue to developers so that the
risk is low and they can get a low-cost loan from a bank and build the
project. That’s what we’re doing with all these procurements at the
state level. And we can use competitive forces like auctions to ensure
that the cheapest projects are the ones we’re going to buy. And I just
think we should open that up from offshore wind specifically, or rooftop
solar specifically to whatever resources are built in the state that can
meet our climate goals and deliver some economic development benefits at
the lowest cost. And so it’s just a question of like, how do you define
that market goal and harness those competitive dynamics to deliver the
public policy goals? That’s what the auctions are doing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>That’s kind of like in some ways, related to
this change that is going to happen and how the Inflation Reduction Act
conducts its subsidies, right? Which is since the 1980s, we’ve been in a
situation where, like, we, the U.S. tax code incentivizes certain types
of technology. And then starting in 2025, I believe the U.S. tax code
will just incentivize all kinds of zero carbon electricity instead of
calling out certain technology. It’s just saying, however you can do it,
we’re going to pay you the subsidy. Yeah.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>And also layering on a couple of other
economic development objectives. Right. You have to meet prevailing wage
and you have to it if you build domestic content, you get more money.
And if you build energy in communities that we want to help transition,
you get more money. So yeah, it’s an interesting example of that where
you’re sort of layering these multiple objectives on, but still relying
on the market to go deliver the lowest cost, most competitive ways to do
that.
</p>
<p>
[AD BREAK]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Let’s do downshifts first because I think we
should end on an upshift.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>That sounds good. Let’s end on the up note. So
my downshift, speaking of utilities and regulation, and actually tying
back to last episode winners and losers from trade, my downshift is a
recent report by the Energy and Policy Institute, which is a public
interest watchdog that keeps an eye on state utility regulation, on how
a number of monopoly utilities, particularly those in the Southeast,
where they are still vertically integrated, so they still own
transmission and generation, have been routinely pushing back against
efforts to build more long distance transmission, and also to organize
into larger regional markets that can, you know, expand the footprint of
trade across a wider area — something that’s happened in all of the
competitive markets in the state and the country — in order to basically
protect their turf, right? So customers in their territories would
benefit from access to cheaper resources further away, and the
transmission lines that could bring that power to those customers. But
the utilities in these areas make their money, like most utilities, by
investing capital and getting a return on those investments. And they
don’t get money in somebody else’s generator. And this is an area where
unless the state regulators are really acting in the public interest and
leaning in here and making sure that the utility is not kind of
basically abusing its control of the network to act as a monopoly, then
there’s every economic incentive for the state or for the there’s every
economic incentive for the utility to do that. And that’s exactly what
we should expect.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>My downshift is, so we’re coming up on the first
anniversary of Heatmap — that’s not my downshift.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>It’s been that bad, huh, Rob?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>I’m very excited about that! No, no, no, my
downshift is, it turns out that, as Neel Dhanesha wrote for Heatmap
today, Heatmap’s first 12 months in existence more or less co-existed
with the first 12 months where the Earth was 1.5 degrees Celsius above
pre-industrial temperature. So from February 2023 through January 2024,
the average global temperature was 1.5 degrees C higher than what we
think of as kind of the 19th century baseline. And that’s according to
the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the EU climate data service. Now,
I should say that just because we’ve had this 12-month period where
temperatures were more than 1.5 C above the pre-industrial average, does
not mean we have passed the so-called 1.5 C threshold, which also, we
should be clear, is not a physical thing. It’s more kind of like a
construct. It’s a political construct that we use to talk about when
climate change starts to get very bad. So we have not passed that
threshold. It is not a point of no return.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>But it is nonetheless an ominous signpost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>It is nonetheless an ominous sign. And of
course, we pass it this year because because of El Niño, which has
caused additional atmospheric warming on top of what we’re observing
with climate change. But it is nonetheless, exactly, an ominous
signpost.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Well, my, my upshift is on heat pumps, so
maybe that’s why you named it Heatmap, too. Yeah. My upshift today is,
is about heat pumps. Heat pumps are a magical device that allow you to
move way more heat around with small amounts of electricity through the
magic of the thermodynamic cycle.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>We should do an episode where you just explain
how heat pumps work.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Magical gnomes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Like, how does the thermos know whether to keep
the liquid hot or cold?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah. So heat pumps are magic. There are like,
300% to 500% efficient, effectively, because you can use a little bit of
electricity to move, you know, two, three, or five times as much heat
around. And so that makes them a really great way to both improve energy
efficiency and shift from burning fossil fuels in our basement, in
furnaces, oil or gas boilers or furnaces to a clean electricity source.
So that reduces air pollution. And of course, if we can produce all that
electricity with clean resources, we’ve helped decarbonize home heating.
So it’s a central technology in any decarbonization and environmental
justice strategy, I should say, because it’s a big source of air
pollution. And so my upshift is from Michael Thomas, who writes a
newsletter called <em>Distilled</em> and is active on Twitter and shared
a great thread today compiling some data on recent heat pump trends in
the U.S., where he found that heat pumps have been outselling gas
furnaces for the last two years in a row, in 2022 and 2023. And that I
thought, most interestingly, the share of homes in the U.S. with heat
pumps has gone up in 48 of 50 states over the last decade, and the most
rapid progress has been driven by states that have recently taken policy
action to try to accelerate adoption of heat pumps.
</p>
<p>
Maine is probably the most exciting story. They basically doubled their
heat pump adoption rate in just two years. And if they kept that up,
that’s crazy to hit. Yeah, and they’re actually on track to hit, yeah,
to get heat pumps in every home in Maine by 2050. And there’s a reason
for Maine to do this: because Maine is not on the natural gas system. So
there, people in Maine are mostly heating with fuel oil and propane,
which has gotten incredibly expensive over the last few years, and
obviously does that periodically because of all those ups and downs and
global oil prices that we mentioned on the last episode. So, yeah, Maine
is an interesting case. It’s cold. A lot of people don’t think heat
pumps can work in cold climates. Well, that’s definitely not true.
There’s huge heat pump adoption in Scandinavian countries and in Canada.
And now in Maine. You just have to design them, right? And probably also
do some energy efficiency improvements to seal up your home when you do
it. But yeah, we’re moving in the right direction on heat pumps.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Home heating oil is so crazy because it’s like,
imagine heating your house with gasoline.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, exactly. Diesel. But dirtier.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Right. It’s so interesting. My upshift. Is that
a new analysis in <em>Carbon Brief</em> from Lauri Myllyvirta, who is
kind of one of the leading analysts of China’s greenhouse gas emissions.
And he found, basically, China’s emissions may have peaked last year.
That kind of, if you look at all the factors in their economy, it’s very
likely China’s emissions will go down this year in 2024 compared to
2023. That, now, that’s partially — and I would say, this is suboptimal.
This is not the upper part of the upshift. That’s partially because of
just very soft economic activity in China. As we record this, the
Chinese stock markets have basically been falling apart over the past
few days. It’s that kind of softness of industrial activity matched with
this massive, massive build out of renewables that is going to that that
in his analysis is going to peak, lead China’s emissions to decline in
2024, and may cause them to permanently kind of subside.
</p>
<p>
And I think the other interesting aspect of this is at the same time he
sees this, he also sees, I think, what people tend to notice more, which
is that China’s continuing to build coal overcapacity in its power grid.
It’s continuing to build a lot of new coal plants, and it kind of talks
about how there is this clash coming up between the cleaner parts of the
economy and the cleaner subsectors, or the new energy subsectors, versus
the kind of old fossil subsectors, both of which are building, but
eventually their needs will directly conflict.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>That’s fascinating. Yeah, we should definitely
do an episode on what the heck is going on in China. You know, one of
those major signposts that we have to pass if we’re going to get the
world on track for net zero, is peak emissions in China the world’s
biggest emitter? And until China turns the corner, you know, we won’t be
able to turn the corner globally to get emissions on a downward
trajectory either. Most likely. So yeah, I’d be really fascinated to see
are we are we nearly at that peak. That’s some encouraging signs, but
we’re not quite sure yet. All right.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> Let’s, yeah, let’s …
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Let’s leave it there and let’s come pick up
the China story again in a future episode here on Shift Key.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Here on Shift Key. You want to share your
friend’s line about what our next podcast should be called?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Let me find that. Yeah. So a friend and early
listener said, are we going to start a recurring section about emissions
trading called Caps Lock? I think we have to.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And California has to re-up its emissions
trading system pretty soon, or it’s going to try to do it pretty soon.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>So maybe we’ll have a special issue.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Special Caps Lock edition of Shift Key. Well,
thank you for listening to Shift Key. And we’ll be back next week. And
in the meantime, subscribe. And please, if you have a friend, an ally, a
coworker, a nemesis, a jilted lover who you think would enjoy the
stimulating discussion and intelligent conversation of Shift Key.
Please. Share the podcast with them and ask them to subscribe.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>See you next week.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Shift Key is a production of Heatmap News. The
podcast was edited by Jillian Goodman. Our editor in chief is Nico
Lauricella, multimedia editing and audio engineering by Jacob Lambert
and Nick Woodbury. Our music is by Adam Kromelow. Thanks so much for

I’m getting good at it. Yesterday I did that with the
<a href="http://scripting.com/2024/02/13.html#a214721">piece</a> about
President Biden and how he probably would rather be doing anything than
be President, for a mostly thankless country, at age 81. I imagine he
has great-grandchildren he’d like to get to know. Maybe a book or two to
read, maybe one to write. To get his affairs in order. At age 68 I’m
trying to shed responsibility as much as possible. It’s prudent, and has
a point. When I was 25 I wanted to take over the world. Now I’d just
like to feel good. As you get older you are capable of more depth of
feeling, in some ways, and grow more numb in others. I spent time with
my father at 80, his last year. He was always a curious man, wanting to
learn about anything new, but in his last days he wasn’t curious. No
ambition. But he seemed okay with it, even happy at times (possibly due
in part to the morphine he was allowed). Anyway, it’s always interesting
to see where people react to what among the different social web
networks. And in this case, the most flow came from
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@davew/111926409460785756">Mastodon</a>,
by far. I would not have predicted that. And it’s good to see, that
interesting ideas and perspective may have more of a future outside the
networks operated by the billionaire tech companies.</p>

David Pierce at The Verge just published a great long-form piece about

the relationship between the people running websites and the people
running spiders and crawlers, and what’s happening now that AI has
entered the scene.
</p>
<p>
It’s a great piece and the timing is convenient for me personally
because just the other day I emailed the lovely people at The Browser
Company asking how can I opt out of their stupid
<a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">ARC Search</a>.
They care about users and user experience and so do I so I’m sure they
must have a way for me to block their new AI. I’m still waiting to get a

Prison-tech is a brutal scam – and a harbinger of your future (14 Feb
2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Prison-tech is a brutal scam – and a harbinger of your
future: My next novel predicts the present. Hey look at this: Delights
to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2013, 2019, 2023
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading Prison-tech is a brutal scam – and a
harbinger of your future (permalink) Here’s how the shitty technology
adoption curve works: when you want to roll out a new, abusive
technology, look for a group of vulnerable people whose complaints are
roundly ignored and subject them to your bad idea. Sand the rough edges
off on their bodies and lives. Normalize the technological abuse you
seek to inflict. Next: work your way up the privilege gradient. Maybe
you start with prisoners, then work your way up to asylum seekers,
parolees and mental patients. Then try it on kids and gig workers. Now,
college students and blue collar workers. Climb that curve, bit by bit,
until you’ve reached its apex and everyone is living with your shitty
technology:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware
Prisoners, asylum seekers, drug addicts and other marginalized people
are the involuntary early adopters of every form of disciplinary
technology. They are the leading indicators of the ways that technology
will be ruining your life in the future. They are the harbingers of all
our technological doom. Which brings me to Minnesota. Minnesota is one
of the first states make prison phone-calls free. This is a big deal,
because prison phone-calls are a big business. Prisoners are literally a
captive audience, and the telecommunications sector is populated by
sociopaths, bred and trained to spot and exploit abusive monopoly
opportunities. As states across America locked up more and more people
for longer and longer terms, the cost of operating prisons skyrocketed,
even as states slashed taxes on the rich and turned a blind eye to tax
evasion. This presented telco predators with an unbeatable opportunity:
they approached state prison operators and offered them a bargain: “Let
us take over the telephone service to your carceral facility and we will
levy eye-watering per-minute charges on the most desperate people in the
world. Their families – struggling with one breadwinner behind bars –
will find the money to pay this ransom, and we’ll split the profits with
you, the cash-strapped, incarceration-happy state government.” This was
the opening salvo, and it turned into a fantastic little money-spinner.
Prison telco companies and state prison operators were the
public-private partnership from hell. Prison-tech companies openly
funneled money to state coffers in the form of kickbacks, even as they
secretly bribed prison officials to let them gouge their inmates and
inmates’ families:
https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/02/mississippi-corrections-corruption-bribery-private-prison-hustle/
As digital technology got cheaper and prison-tech companies got
greedier, the low end of the shitty tech adoption curve got a lot more
crowded. Prison-tech companies started handing out “free” cheap Android
tablets to prisoners, laying the groundwork for the next phase of the
scam. Once prisoners had tablets, prisons could get rid of phones
altogether and charge prisoners – and their families – even higher rates
to place calls right to the prisoner’s cell. Then, prisons could end
in-person visits and replace them with sub-skype, postage-stamp-sized
videoconferencing, at rates even higher than the voice-call rates.
Combine that with a ban on mailing letters to and from prisoners –
replaced with a service that charged even higher rates to scan mail sent
to prisoners, and then charged prisoners to download the scans – and
prison-tech companies could claim to be at the vanguard of prison
safety, ending the smuggling of dope-impregnated letters and other
contraband into the prison system. Prison-tech invented some wild shit,
like the “digital stamp,” a mainstay of industry giant Jpay, which
requires prisoners to pay for “stamps” to send or receive a “page” of
email. If you’re keeping score, you’ve realized that this is a system
where prisoners and their families have to pay for calls, “in-person”
visits, handwritten letters, and email. It goes on: prisons shuttered
their libraries and replaced them with ebook stores that charged 2-4
times the prices you’d pay for books on the outside. Prisoners were sold
digital music at 200-300% markups relative to, say, iTunes. Remember,
these are prisoners: locked up for years or decades, decades during
which their families scraped by with a breadwinner behind bars.
Prisoners can earn money, sure – as much as $0.89/hour, doing forced
labor for companies that contract with prisons for their workforce:
https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/04/10/wages/ Of course, there’s
the odd chance for prisoners to make really big bucks – $2-5/day. All
they have to do is “volunteer” to fight raging wildfires:
https://www.hcn.org/articles/climate-desk-wildfire-california-incarcerated-firefighters-face-dangerous-work-low-pay-and-covid19/
So those $3 digital music tracks are being bought by people earning as
little as $0.10/hour. Which makes it especially galling when prisons
change prison-tech suppliers, whereupon all that digital music is
deleted, wiping prisoners’ media collection out – forever (literally,
for prisoners serving life terms):
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/08/captive-audience-how-floridas-prisons-and-drm-made-113m-worth-prisoners-music
Let’s recap: America goes on a prison rampage, locking up ever-larger
numbers of people for ever-longer sentences. Once inside, prisoners had
their access to friends and family rationed, along with access to books,
music, education and communities outside. This is very bad for prisoners
– strong ties to people outside is closely tied to successful reentry –
but it’s great for state budgets, and for wardens, thanks to kickbacks:
https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2021/12/21/family_contact/ Back to
Minnesota: when Minnesota became the fourth state in the USA where the
state, not prisoners, would pay for prison calls, it seemed like they
were finally breaking the vicious cycle in which every dollar ripped off
of prisoners’ family paid 40 cents to the state treasury:
https://www.kaaltv.com/news/no-cost-phone-calls-for-those-incarcerated-in-minnesota/
But – as Katya Schwenk writes for The Lever – what happened next is “a
case study in how prison communication companies and their private
equity owners have managed to preserve their symbiotic relationship with
state corrections agencies despite reforms — at the major expense of
incarcerated people and their families”:
https://www.levernews.com/wall-streets-new-prison-scam/ Immediately
after the state ended the ransoming of prisoners’ phone calls, the
private-equity backed prison-tech companies that had dug their
mouth-parts into the state’s prison jacked up the price of all their
other digital services. For example, the price of a digital song in a
Minnesota prison just jumped from $1.99 to $2.36 (for prisoners earning
as little as $0.25/hour). As Paul Wright from the Human Rights Defense
Center told Schwenk, “The ideal world for the private equity owners of
these companies is every prisoner has one of their tablets, and every
one of those tablets is hooked up to the bank account of someone outside
of prison that they can just drain.” The state’s new prison-tech
supplier promises to double the amount of kickbacks it pays the state
each year, thanks to an aggressive expansion into games, money
transfers, and other “services.” The perverse incentive isn’t hard to
spot: the more these prison-tech companies charge, the more kickbacks
they pay to the prisons. The primary prison-tech company for Minnesota’s
prisons is Viapath (nee Global Tel Link), which pioneered price-gouging
on in-prison phone calls. Viapath has spent the past two decades being
bought and sold by different private equity firms: Goldman Sachs,
Veritas Capital, and now the $46b/year American Securities. Viapath
competes with another private equity-backed prison-tech giant: Aventiv
(Securus, Jpay), owned by Platinum Equity. Together, Viapath and Aventiv
control 90% of the prison-tech market. These companies have a rap-sheet
as long as your arm: bribing wardens, stealing from prisoners and their
families, and recording prisoner-attorney calls. But these are the kinds
of crimes the state punishes with fines and settlements – not by
terminating its contracts with these predators. These companies continue
to flout the law. Minnesota’s new free-calls system bans prison-tech
companies from paying kickbacks to prisons and prison-officials for
telcoms services, so the prison-tech companies have rebranded ebooks,
music, and money-transfers as non-communications products, and the
kickbacks are bigger than ever. This is the bottom end of the shitty
technology adoption curve. Long before Ubisoft started deleting games
that you’d bought a “perpetual license” for, prisoners were having their
media ganked by an uncaring corporation that knew it was untouchable:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIqyvquTEVU Revoking your media,
charging by the byte for messaging, confiscating things in the name of
security and then selling them back to you – these are all tactics that
were developed in the prison system, refined, normalized, and then
worked up the privilege gradient. Prisoners are living in your
technology future. It’s just not evenly distributed – yet. As it
happens, prison-tech is at the heart of my next novel, The Bezzle, which
comes out on Feb 20. This is a followup to last year’s bestselling Red
Team Blues, which introduced the world to Marty Hench, a two-fisted,
hard-bitten, high-tech forensic accountant who’s spent 40 years busting
Silicon Valley finance scams:

Zelig and every book is a standalone tale of high-tech ripoffs from a
different time and place). Marty’s trying to help his old pal Scott
Warms, a once-high-flying founder who’s fallen prey to California’s
three-strikes law and is now facing decades in a state pen. As bad as
things are, they get worse when the prison starts handing out “free”
tablet and closing down the visitation room, the library, and the
payphones. This is an entry to the thing I love most about the Hench
novels: the opportunity to turn all this dry, financial skullduggery
into high-intensity, high-stakes technothriller plot. For me, Marty
Hench is a tool for flensing the scam economy of all its layers of
respectability bullshit and exposing the rot at the core. It’s not a
coincidence that I’ve got a book coming out in a week that’s about
something that’s in the news right now. I didn’t “predict” this current
turn – I observed it. The world comes at you fast and technology news
flutters past before you can register it. Luckily, I have a method for
capturing this stuff as it happens:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ Writing about tech
issues that are long-simmering but still in the periphery is a technique
I call “predicting the present.” It’s the technique I used when I wrote
Little Brother, about out-of-control state surveillance of the internet.
When Snowden revealed the extent of NSA spying in 2013, people acted as
though I’d “predicted” the Snowden revelations:
https://www.wired.com/story/his-writing-radicalized-young-hackers-now-he-wants-to-redeem-them/
But Little Brother and Snowden’s own heroic decision have a common
origin: the brave whistleblower Mark Klein, who walked into EFF’s
offices in 2006 and revealed that he’d been ordered by his boss at
AT&amp;T to install a beam-splitter into the main fiber trunk so that
the NSA could illegally wiretap the entire internet:
https://www.eff.org/document/public-unredacted-klein-declaration Mark
Klein inspired me to write Little Brother – but despite national press
attention, the Klein revelations didn’t put a stop to NSA spying. The
NSA was still conducting its lawless surveillance campaign in 2013, when
Snowden, disgusted with NSA leadership for lying to Congress under oath,
decided to blow the whistle again:
https://apnews.com/article/business-33a88feb083ea35515de3c73e3d854ad The
assumption that let the NSA get away with mass surveillance was that it
would only be weaponized against the people at the bottom of the shitty
technology adoption curve: brown people, mostly in other countries. The
Snowden revelations made it clear that these were just the beginning,
and sure enough, more than a decade later, we have data-brokers sucking
up billions in cop kickbacks to enable warrantless surveillance, while
virtually following people to abortion clinics, churches, and protests.
Mass surveillance is chugging its way up the shitty tech adoption curve
with no sign of stopping. Like Little Brother, The Bezzle is intended as
a kind of virtual flythrough of what life is like further down on that
curve – a way for readers who have too much agency to be in the
crosshairs of a company like Viapath or Avently right now to wake up
before that kind of technology comes for them, and to inspire them to
take up the cause of the people further down the curve who are mired in
it. The Bezzle is an intense book, but it’s also a very fun story – just
like Little Brother. It’s a book that lays bare the internal technical
workings of so many scams, from multi-level marketing to real-estate
investment trusts, from music royalty theft to prison-tech, in the
course of an ice-cold revenge plot that keeps twisting to the very last
page. It’ll drop in six days. I hope you’ll check it out:

The JackRabbit electric micro bike is as divisive as it is diminutive,

Market for 24/7 Clean Power Might Look Something Like This</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
There are two kinds of people who work on climate solutions: Those who
still believe in the promise of carbon markets, and those who think the
whole concept is fundamentally flawed.
</p>
<p>
In the first category, you have people like McGee Young, the CEO of a
company called WattCarbon. Young is aware of the ways carbon markets can
be a race to the bottom — enabling companies to buy cheap certificates
that say they used clean energy or reduced their carbon footprint, when
in reality their purchase had little effect on the environment or the
energy system.
</p>
<p>
And yet, there’s all this money out there for the taking! Companies want
to green their image! Tackling climate change is expensive! There must
be a way to funnel corporate sustainability budgets to where they can
make a real impact!
</p>
<p>
To Young, the solution is a matter of better data and greater
transparency. “We need a record-keeping system that allows us to raise
the bar,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
Young launched his vision for that record-keeping system on Wednesday —
the WattCarbon Energy Attribute Tracking System, or WEATS. It functions
similarly to other environmental credit registries: Owners of clean
energy assets can sign up to generate credits known as Environmental
Attribute Certificates, or EACs, which buyers can then purchase to count
toward their own clean energy or carbon goals.
</p>
<p>
WEATS has two main features that differentiate it. First, it will
include credits from small-scale distributed energy resources like
residential solar panels, batteries, and heat pumps — clean energy
solutions that haven’t really been able to participate in carbon markets
until now. Second, each EAC will include granular information about
where and when the power was generated, in the case of solar, or the
carbon savings incurred, in the case of heat pumps, down to the hour.
</p>
<p>
The first feature is part of what motivated Young to start WattCarbon.
“The clean energy transition is more than just wind and solar, it’s more
than just generation,” he told me. But it’s the second that Young said
is key to improving the credibility of claims that companies are “using
100% clean energy,” or “achieving net-zero.”
</p>
<p>
Today, many companies simply buy enough clean energy credits to match
their annual energy use, regardless of where or when the energy was
generated. But researchers have shown that this strategy can have little
to no impact on emissions. For example, if a company is only buying
solar credits, but it is using energy at night, its carbon footprint
from that nighttime energy could surpass any environmental benefits of
the solar it bought.
</p>
<p>
To solve this, some energy buyers have embraced a concept called “24/7
carbon-free energy,” which means that “every kilowatt-hour of
electricity consumption is met with carbon-free electricity sources,
every hour of every day, everywhere,” in the words of a
<a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/2021/10/24-7cfe_compact_-_v2_updated.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United
Nations-led initiative</a> to promote the concept. “It is both the end
state of a fully decarbonized electricity system,” according to the UN,
“and a transformative approach to energy procurement, supply, and policy
design that is critical to accelerating its arrival.”
</p>
<p>
If you’ve followed the recent debate about the green hydrogen tax
credit, you might be familiar with the idea. In December,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self">the
Treasury Department proposed</a> that hydrogen producers will have to
match their electricity consumption with the purchase of local clean
electricity generation <em>on an hourly basis</em> to prove their
hydrogen is clean enough to qualify for the full value of the tax
credit. That means producers can either hook up directly to a solar farm
or wind farm or geothermal power plant and operate only when it is
generating power, or, it can buy renewable energy credits or EACs that
correspond to the hours that it operates.
</p>
<p>
WattCarbon’s marketplace is one of the first to enable this by requiring
sellers to include data about exactly where and when each EAC was
produced. It also include the carbon intensity of the grid in the place
and time when that unit of power was produced. For example, 1
megawatt-hour of solar power in West Virginia, where the grid is
supplied by a lot of coal-fired power plants, would likely reduce
emissions far more than 1 megawatt-hour of solar power in California,
where the main fossil fuel burned for power is natural gas. Similarly, 1
megawatt-hour of solar generated in the afternoon in California will not
do as much to reduce emissions as if that unit of power were stored in a
battery and then dispatched at night. On other markets, all of these
credits might simply be advertised as 1 megawatt-hour of solar power,
and the buyer would be none the wiser.
</p>
<p>
So what does this new carbon trading marketplace look like in practice?
There are a lot of possibilities, but here’s one scenario. WattCarbon
partners with a company that helps homeowners electrify their heating or
install and manage their solar and battery systems. That third party
company can then say to their customers, “As an extra incentive to do
this, we can help you sell the environmental benefits it provides to
third parties through the WattCarbon marketplace,” and those extra
payments are what convinces the homeowner to go for it.
</p>
<p>
Independent experts I spoke with were cautiously optimistic about what
this new marketplace could do. “We need to deploy
<a href="https://saulgriffith.medium.com/one-billion-machines-48a7c3cf0694" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on
the order of a billion machines</a>, in the U.S. alone — and not over a
century, but on the order of a decade,” said Kevin Kircher, an assistant
professor of mechanical engineering at Purdue University, whose research
focuses on heat pumps and other distributed energy resources. “So
there’s a lot that needs to be done, and just connecting people to money
to do the work is really important.”
</p>
<p>
Wilson Ricks, a PhD candidate at Princeton University whose research
informed the Treasury’s proposal for the hydrogen tax credit, said that
having a platform where hydrogen companies can procure clean energy from
a variety of projects, and with time and location data, would be very
useful. He was also intrigued by WattCarbon’s attempt to create EACs
tied to batteries because energy storage systems are one of the few
resources that can produce clean power when the wind isn’t blowing and
the sun isn’t shining.
</p>
<p>
But both Ricks and Kircher warned there are a number of ways this system
of credits could fall into the same traps that ensnare many carbon
offset projects and reduce their credibility. For one, it’s really hard
to get the math right. That’s especially true for a project like a heat
pump, where the carbon savings are based on a counterfactual situation
where the homeowner would have kept their gas heater. You have to
basically estimate how often they would have run it, which opens the
door to sloppiness at best and fraud at worst.
</p>
<p>
Another key criterion — a concept called additionality — is very hard to
assess. Would the household that switches to a heat pump have done so
regardless of whether they were getting extra revenue from selling EACs?
If the answer is unequivocally yes, the credits are meaningless and
serve to give corporate emitters an excuse to keep emitting.
</p>
<p>
Young acknowledged to me that this was likely going to be true in some
cases, but still felt that heat pump owners deserved to be paid for the
environmental benefits they were providing. “We provide environmental
subsidies for large-scale wind and solar, and we don’t do that for the
things that we’re putting into our buildings and our communities. And to
me, there’s an inherent inequality in the way that we treat and value
clean energy that needs to be addressed.”
</p>
<p>
That didn’t quite make sense to me — the government provides subsidies
for all kinds of clean energy resources, including distributed energy
resources, I countered. The Treasury will give you $2,000 for a heat
pump and a 30% discount on rooftop solar.
</p>
<p>
“That’s true,” Young said. “But we don’t have enough money in all of our
government programs to truly scale those.”
</p>
<p>
I couldn’t argue with that. But the real challenge is helping low-income
homeowners with the upfront capital to install these devices —
after-the-fact payments are not enough. Young said he had plans to
create a way for companies to procure EACs in advance from groups of
homeowners. The deals would be similar to the power purchase agreements
that big electricity consumers like Google and Walmart make with
large-scale renewable energy developers, helping to finance those
projects by reducing the risk.
</p>
<p>
“This is a necessary but not sufficient step,” Young said of the version
of the marketplace that launched Wednesday. “Without this, we can’t do
that. But this by itself would be inadequate for the market to be able
to reach its fullest potential.”

sheds light on how polar bears are changing their diets and behaviors in
a warming world. Climate change is shrinking the sea ice on which the
bears rely for hunting seals. As the ice melts, the bears are forced
onto land, where they can either reduce their physical activity in order
to save energy and calories, or forage for berries and small prey. The
research, which involved strapping cameras to 20 bears in Canada’s
Manitoba province, found that neither option is enough to prevent the
animals from going hungry. All of them lost weight and two of them were
on track to starve before the sea ice was expected to return. “Polar
bears are not grizzly bears wearing white coats,”

The rise in extreme weather events has already roiled the home insurance
market, making it more expensive – or even impossible – for homeowners
in some high-risk areas to take out a policy. Now health insurers are
“building new models to reassess premiums, estimate risk, and meet
incoming climate reporting standards,” the <em>Journal</em> said. Recent
research has linked extreme heat and wildfire smoke to a variety of
health problems including heart attacks and cancer, and insurers want to
know what this all means for their bottom lines. But the
<em>Journal</em> reports that for now, insurers aren’t worried about
their profits, “because the groups most likely to be affected by climate
change aren’t covered by insurance.”

<h2 id="oddµ-namespaces-and-live-updating">2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces
and live updating</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-09 Oddµ namespaces and live updating
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
It’s a slow morning. I had my two cups of coffee, ate my pancakes with
plum jam, spent time online reading Mastodon, talked to my wife about
wannabe-axe murderers on Swiss trains, looked up stuff about
<a href="https://www.tax-the-rich.eu/">taxing the rich</a>…
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve been working on Oddmu again. My goal is to be able to reproduce the
<a href="https://campaignwiki.org/">Campaign Wiki</a> setup:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
people can get a “space” for their site by signing up in some way
</li>
<li>
they can make changes to the look and feel of their site (change the
headers, footers, colours, i.e. make changes to both the HTML template
and the CSS)
</li>
<li>
feeds, list of changes and all that are limited to their site
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Using Oddmu would also result in the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
sites are no longer publically editable (which isn’t a requirement for
such spaces like role-playing game campaigns)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Oddmu now has the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
when editing pages in a subdirectory, the <code>index</code> and
<code>changes</code> page in the same directory are updated (instead of
the root directory)
</li>
<li>
when HTML templates exist in the same directory, those are used instead
of the templates in the root directory
(e.g. <a href="oddmu/index">Oddµ</a>)
</li>
<li>
when uploading a HTML template, it is loaded immediately (no more server
restart)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once I had this implemented using a library that watches the filesystem
for changes, I realized that I could use the same feature to index new
pages. This brings me closer to having online and offline writing
feature equivalence: Using the web site to create a page should be
equivalent to writing a page elsewhere and uploading it to the site via
rsync. (Offline you can use the <code>oddmu notify</code> command to add
links to <code>index</code>, <code>changes</code> and hashtag pages.)
</p>
<p>
I think I’m getting close!
</p>
<p>
<a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Oddµ">#Oddµ</a>
</p>
<p>
Also, code complexity is through the roof, now. All the global maps
aren’t thread-safe so they need mutexes. There’s a weird Heisenbug I
have where I run the test suite and then <code>view.html</code> is gone.
The next test run then fails, of course. Thinking it was related to the
order of tests, I started running <code>go test -shuffle on</code> and
found a plethora of <em>other</em> bugs. And I’ve seen at least two
occasions where I noticed the disappearing <code>view.html</code> bug,
noted the shuffle id, reran the test with that id, got the error again,
tried for a third time, and then tests passed. So… it must be a race
condition of some sort.
</p>
<p>
How aggravating.
</p>
<p>
Maybe something got lost, with that last set of changes.
</p>
<p>
I do feel, however, that I’ve found a lot of bugs… Just now, for
example, to help prevent Oddmu from showing any directories or files
with a path segment starting with a period…
</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-02-14</strong>. I need to think about an archive handler
that allows you to get a zip file for the current directory. (I guess
zip files are more accessible than .tar.gz files? Like, for Windows and
macOS…
</p>
<p>
And the archive needs to take
<a href="2024-02-14-oddmu-bug">ODDMU_FILTER</a> into account!
</p>
<p>
Done. ✔️

Lovers and chocolate lovers beware: If you’re eyeing a heart-shaped box

cost. Cocoa prices recently hit an all-time high and sugar prices have
spiked too. Rather bittersweet, huh? But first, Tuesday’s inflation data

Getting a company car used to be a major perk of a new job, but times
are changing. As more young adults flock to electric bikes for their
advantages over car travel in cities, companies are now making their own
changes to reflect those shifting transportation habits.

<p>Friends, There’s so much hate and nastiness in public life these days
— by “public life,” I mean anyone who is known to the broad public,
including politicians, celebrities, athletes, actors, writers, painters,
and journalists — that it’s probably easy for you to come up with people
in public life you detest. (My list would include Donald Trump, Vladimir
Putin, Benjamin Netanyahu, Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, and Kari
Lake, for example.)</p>

<h2 id="oddµ-bug-maybe">2024-02-14 Oddµ bug maybe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-14, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-14 Oddµ bug maybe
</h1>
<p>
I had a site where an entire subdirectory was private. Nobody but the
author could read or write those pages. I had configured Apache to
require authentication for this subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
The config looked a bit like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/(edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|view/secret)/&quot;&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Password Required&quot;
  AuthUserFile /home/oddmu/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
Note the addition of <code>view/secret</code>.
</p>
<p>
But yesterday I realized that you can run a search in the root. Such a
search includes all the pages in subdirectories, and so Oddmu served an
extract of the pages in the “secret” subdirectory. Adding
<code>|search/secret</code> to the <code>LocationMatch</code> doesn’t
help.
</p>
<p>
I had to decide whether to disable search all together, or disable the
search of subdirectories, or add a new feature.
</p>
<p>
I added a new feature.
</p>
<p>
It is tied to an environment variable called <code>ODDMU_FILTER</code>.
It matches the directory being searched and the directory where the
search starts. If the directory doesn’t match, the pages returned must
also not match; if the directory does match, the pages returned must
also match.
</p>
<p>
Here’s an example of three pages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
/a
</li>
<li>
/public/b
</li>
<li>
/secret/c
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The environment variable is set: <code>ODDMU_FILTER=^secret/</code> –
what happens now?
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If you search from the root (doesn’t match the filter), then only pages
a and b are searched (they also don’t match the filter).
</li>
<li>
If you search from /public (doesn’t match the filter), then only page b
is searched (also doesn’t match the filter). This behaviour is unchanged
from before. Searches start with the directory the user is looking at.
</li>
<li>
If you search from /secret (matches the filter), then only page c is
searched (also matches the filter). This, too, is unchanged from before.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Naturally, you still need to change to the web server config for the
actual authentication to happen:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;LocationMatch &quot;^/(edit|save|add|append|upload|drop|view/secret|search/secret)/&quot;&gt;
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName &quot;Password Required&quot;
  AuthUserFile /home/oddmu/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
I hope I got it right! It’s also documented in the
<a href="oddmu/oddmu-apache.5">oddmu-apache(5)</a> man page.
