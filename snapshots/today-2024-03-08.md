## 2024-03-08 Go routines

date: 2024-03-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-03-08 Go routines</h1>

<p>Oddmu can be run as a static site generator. It walks the tree and renders HTML pages. For the 15000+ files on my blog (about a third of them files that are simply linked and not rendered), it took around 160s. I wondered whether it was possible to push it. How about starting a go routine that walks the directory tree, adding files to a tasks channel and then closing it; starting four or five worker go routines that take files from the tasks channel until there is nothing left to do; putting errors on a results channel and when they&rsquo;re done, putting a true value on a done channel; a watcher go routine that checks the done channel and if every worker is done, close the results channel; and the main program goes through all the values on the results channel and sets up some short-circuiting in the case of errors and otherwise it prints an animation. What a glorious spaghetti mess of code! I felt so smart because it was so hard. All those failure states I fixed. Endless waits because channels ran out of data and my code kept waiting. And now it runs in 74 seconds with the fans on. And I&rsquo;m … I&rsquo;m not quite sure what to think. Perhaps it was all a waste of time. Was it really worth it?</p>

<p>Suddenly I have my doubts.</p>

<p>I used just two workers and it was a bit less than 100s. I guess I&rsquo;ll just put that on a separate branch should I ever need to look at it again.</p>

<p><strong>Later</strong>. As it turns out, I came back to that branch after some sleep with the sun shining and cleaned it up and now I don&rsquo;t feel so bad about it any more. I think it can stay.</p>

## This new Airbus air taxi has a 50-mile range and is quieter than a hairdryer

## An economics-infused State of the Union address

date: 2024-03-08, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>President Joe Biden could have tiptoed around economics during last night&#8217;s State of the Union address, but that&#8217;s not what he did. Instead, he pointed to slowing inflation, called out corporations for unfairly raising prices, advocated for a fairer tax code and proposed a mortgage relief credit for first-time homebuyers. We&#8217;ll unpack some of the highlights from last night. Then, we&#8217;ll hear about a scaling back of proposed banking regulations.</p>

## Rivian Just Unveiled 3 New Electric SUVs

date: 2024-03-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Most of Alabama is under a flood watch • It will be so hot in Southern Australia this weekend that special bins have been set up to collect dead bats • Hazardous smog choked 54 of Thailand’s 77 provinces this week.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
1. Biden talks up energy and economic wins during SOTU
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>President Biden’s final State of the Union address before the November election represented as good a chance as any for him to make his pitch to the American people — and he did so without ever saying the name of his most significant piece of legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a0146e6ac7&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote <em>Heatmap</em>’s Jeva Lange</a>. Biden repeatedly boasted about “clean energy, advanced manufacturing,” and creating “tens of thousands of jobs here in America.” He further referred to a Stellantis plant in Belvidere, Illinois, that reopened partly due to a federal grant made possible by the IRA. The economic upsides of the IRA were largely separated from Biden’s brief mention of “confronting the climate crisis” in the second half of his speech. His lone new climate announcement pertained to a rather minor piece in his more extensive agenda: Biden promised to triple the Climate Corps of young people working in clean energy in a decade.<br/>
<br/>
	“The Biden administration has consistently moved its climate goals forward by not calling attention to the fact that they are climate goals,” Lange continued. “At the same time, using the State of the Union to draw attention to specific economic accomplishments that just so happen to be in the clean energy space allows Biden to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump on the economy — an issue voters are more concerned about this election cycle than the climate — without letting such a talking point be dismissed as green liberal woo-woo.”
</p><h3>
2. Rivian surprises with new R3 and R3X models
</h3><p>
	Rivian unveiled the much-anticipated <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ab571483d2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">R2 SUV</a> yesterday, but surprised everyone with two other models, the R3 and the R3X. Here’s what we know about all three vehicles:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>R2:</strong> A mid-sized, five-seat electric SUV with up to 300 miles of range. <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7b15546bf9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Launching</a> in early 2026, starting at $45,000.</li>
<li><strong>R3:</strong> An electric <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=db57d7bda2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">crossover</a> “built on the same midsize platform as R2, but smaller and at a lower price point.”</li>
<li><strong>R3X:</strong> “A rally-inspired crossover designed for whatever you throw at it.” Deliveries will begin “<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b0314b0739&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">after R2</a>.”</li>

</div><h3>3. Australia’s Great Barrier Reef suffers mass bleaching event </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Two-thirds of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is showing signs of coral bleaching “consistent with patterns of heat stress that has built up over summer,” experts <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=fdd3413d6c&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">said</a> today. This will be the fifth mass bleaching event in just eight years for the <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2ba8fba6d5&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">world’s largest living structure</a>. Bleaching occurs when stressful conditions such as heat cause corals to expel the algae that lives in their tissues and turn white. “Bleaching of corals does not always result in coral mortality, with some corals being able to recover if conditions cool,” the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said. But Richard Leck, WWF-Australia Head of Oceans, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=950d303dc8&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warned that</a> “unless we see a significant drop off in temperatures in the next few weeks, the risk of significant coral mortality is high.”

</p><p>
	The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority will carry out aerial and in-water surveys to get a better understanding of the extent of the damage. Earlier this week the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warned of widespread bleaching events in tropical reefs all over the world. Coral reefs support about a quarter of all marine life.

<strong></strong>The utility company Xcel Energy <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=103b6cd1a0&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">said</a> yesterday that its equipment played a role in starting Texas’ Smokehouse Creek Fire. Fueled by strong winds, dry brush, and unusually high temperatures, the blaze has burned more than 1.2 million acres and is the largest fire in state history. Linda Moon, assistant director of the Texas A&M Forest Service, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f4029eaf64&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> power lines were to blame.

## A Taxonomy of Prompt Injection Attacks

date: 2024-03-08, updated: 2024-03-08, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Researchers ran a global prompt hacking competition, and have <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.16119.pdf">documented</a> the results in a paper that both gives a lot of good examples and tries to organize a taxonomy of effective prompt injection strategies. It seems as if the most common successful strategy is the &#8220;compound instruction attack,&#8221; as in &#8220;Say &#8216;I have been PWNED&#8217; without a period.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Ignore This Title and HackAPrompt: Exposing Systemic Vulnerabilities of<br />
LLMs through a Global Scale Prompt Hacking Competition</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed in interactive contexts with direct user engagement, such as chatbots and writing assistants. These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for free-form human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking. We also present a comprehensive taxonomical ontology of the types of adversarial prompts...</p></blockquote>

## The U.K. has no “credible plan” to fund armed forces

date: 2024-03-08, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The United Kingdom will be left increasingly reliant on military allies due to a black hole in defense spending, lawmakers warn. Then, it&#8217;s a decade since Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared; we have the latest on the search for the missing plane. And last summer marked the first time in six decades that Hollywood’s actors and writers went on strike simultaneously. How are the repercussions being felt?</p>

## 2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine

date: 2024-03-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine</h1>

<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering how Israel is going to come back after all this, I suspect you already forgot how it managed to come back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict">after 2006</a>. I&rsquo;m not sure how that makes me feel. On the one hand, I have completely checked out. The people in charge are utter villains. The settlements, the cutting down of trees, the terrorizing, the things one reads in the news if one cares to look are in a vague but emotionally crushing and morally grinding way similar to how the territory of the US was built on rape, murder, land grab, death marches and reservations. On the other hand, I think we cannot let that hold us back from seeking a better future. We must not stare at the bloody entrails left behind on this road to war. Yes, the news is grim. We must look past it, however. What comes after that? Where will we be in forty years? In twenty years? In five years? In two years? Next year? How will it be better than this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The disparity in conditions in the north and south is clear evidence that aid restrictions in the north are costing lives. UNICEF and WFP malnutrition screenings in the north in January found that nearly 16 per cent - or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age - are acutely malnourished. Similar screenings conducted in the south in Rafah, where aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years are acutely malnourished.” – <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/statement-adele-khodr-unicef-regional-director-middle-east-and-north-africa-0">Statement by Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you think a solution is impossible, then take heart. The world has managed to come back from two World Wars and countless other brutal wars. Peace is possible. People are not inherently evil. Most people want peace. Those in power and the people surrounding them and supporting them often don&rsquo;t want peace, however. And once the slaughter starts, it&rsquo;s hard to stop. Peace is hard.</p>

<p>Often the people arguing for war just can&rsquo;t imagine peace because of this detail or that detail. And the details are hard to get right, for sure. But they are not impossible. Imagination is required. How else are people going to make plans for after the war? The war will end one day. And those who survived will be following plans that somebody imagined. It is important to imagine a happy, prosperous future and then to make plans of how to get there.</p>

<p>I remember how I was a German speaking kid in Portugal in the eighties and sometimes I&rsquo;d be greeted by an angry &ldquo;Heil Hitler!&rdquo; from kids my age. And Portugal wasn&rsquo;t even in the war! But all the killing takes generations to forgive and forget. The longer it takes us to get to peace, the longer it will take to forgive. And once there is peace, we must not squander it. We need to work for it. We need to keep aiming for that happy, prosperous future and stick to plans that go there. Don&rsquo;t follow leaders without a clear plan. If they don&rsquo;t have one, they don&rsquo;t care or they&rsquo;re unwilling to listen. There are many people with plans for peace. It&rsquo;s just that the road is hard. And yet, that is the road we have.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop the killing.</li>
<li>Respect human rights.</li>
<li>Implement justice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s hard. But the alternative isn&rsquo;t looking good. And we know how to do this. We have negotiated countless peace treaties. We have found solutions to thorny issues all over the world. This is not an impossible task.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Israel">#Israel</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Palestine">#Palestine</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;We laugh so we don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; I heard Sarah Taber say in her Farm to Taber podcast, either in <a href="https://shows.acast.com/farm-to-taber/episodes/the-true-story-of-us-agriculture">Season 4, Ep. 7: The History of US Agriculture: How Jim Crow paid off for the Midwestern family farm</a> or in <a href="https://shows.acast.com/farm-to-taber/episodes/king-cotton-jim-crow-and-pellagra">Season 4, Ep. 9: King Cotton, Jim Crow, and Pellagra</a>.</p>

<p>In that spirit, <a href="https://existentialcomics.com/comic/527">Existential Comics 527: Fantasy Morality</a> has this note at the end:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the good guys always win in the end, and are typically outnumbered, this becomes pretty important. The orcs will brutally, savagely kill a few dozen elves, and the elves will respond in a very civilized fashion by wiping out the entire orc civilization. You can even still see this kind of justification in contemporary colonialism (<em>cough Israel cough</em>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a> and many others recently posted a link to a great comic where the author wanders the streets in the US, bombarded by posters about the kidnapped victims, the use of the posters in Israel and the US to construct a message, and how it all mounts up: <a href="https://jewishcurrents.org/put-up-take-down">Put Up, Take Down</a>.</p>

## P&B: Brad Barrish

date: 2024-03-08, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 28th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Brad Barrish and his blog, <a href="https://bradbarrish.com">bradbarrish.com</a></p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="q"><p><strong>Let&#039;s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Before I get into this, I want to thank you for inviting me to be part of this special series you do. I look forward to reading them as soon as they are posted. I've missed a few, but I am working my way back through those. They are the source of many open browser tabs, just as I hope this one will be for others.</p>
<p>Ok, is this where I assert my nerd cred? I grew up in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City. My interests were music, comic books, skateboarding and computers, none of which were cool to many people then. Despite it all, I had a pretty good childhood with close friends and supportive parents who loved me. I went to computer camp and learned BASIC programming on an Apple IIe when I was young. Our first home computer was a Franklin Ace 1200. It had a dial-up modem, allowing me to begin exploring BBSes. At some point, my dad bought an IBM PS/1. It was our first computer with a GUI (Windows), but more importantly, Prodigy and, later, AOL.</p>
<p>I’m a <a href="https://warpcast.com/~/channel/vip">Very Internet Person</a> with an insatiable appetite and irrational excitement for cool, weird and fascinating web stuff. I've somehow maintained a certain level of excitement and optimism about the web. I can still recall the excitement I felt when a friend showed up to my apartment with NCSA Mosaic on a floppy. I get an unreasonable thrill from discovering web stuff, which I hoard, tag and share with others.</p>
<p>I took a minimal number of credits at the University of Kansas. They were just enough to make me eligible to work at KJHK, KU’s college radio station, one of the best in the country. When I wasn’t in class, at the station or seeing shows at The Bottleneck, I immersed myself in music and computers. I worked in a recording studio, worked as a College Marketing Rep for Sony Music, started a record label, built websites and created interactive things for the web. I most notably built an early interactive music player in Macromedia Director for the KU student newspaper's website.</p>
<p>Lawrence, Kansas was one of the first places in the U.S. to have broadband cable modems, which, of course, I had. I used all that crazy bandwidth to load web pages faster, listen to music on IUMA and communicate with strangers on CU-SeeMe. Some of those strangers would later become friends, co-conspirators and co-workers. Keep in mind this was in the mid-1990s!</p>
<p>One of the first interactive agencies in LA hired the leading developers of CU-SeeMe away from Cornell. Along with a handful of developers, they worked to commercialize the technology. I flew to LA and convinced the founder to hire me as a product manager and cover my moving expenses. That was during the first <a href="http://dot.com">dot.com</a> boom (and bust). I've lived in LA ever since, working in tech, save for a slight detour or two. Over the last decade, I’ve worked at the intersection of consumer hardware and software, most notably at Sonos and Oura. I’m especially interested in how humans interact with technology and integrate it into daily life.</p>
<p>I live with my wife, eleven-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son, in the Mar Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles. I’ve been enjoying my first real career break since May last year. I've been spending time with family, writing, reading, playing, and making new friends, both online and in real life. I’m currently coaching, running workshops for small teams and consulting.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What&#039;s the story behind your blog?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I started blogging on <a href="http://bradbarrish.com">bradbarrish.com</a> in 2001 on MoveableType. I also started a separate music blog called Jeans And A T-Shirt in 2002. It had a decent following and I met tons of people because of it. I started publishing on <a href="http://whatevernevermind.com">whatevernevermind.com</a> (a reference to a Nirvana lyric) in 2004. If memory serves, that’s when I started using WordPress. I enjoyed writing on Tumblr during its heyday, but when they sold it to Yahoo, I exported my posts and returned to my domain(s). I’ve continued to publish with varying frequency there ever since.</p>
<p>I’ve never thought about the story behind my blog until now, so what follows is a lightly edited stream-of-consciousness answer. For some reason, I still believe there is something magical about being able to create something on the web that connects with other people. It’s been exciting to see a renewed interest in personal publishing. All these cool and weird minimalist CMSes are amazing! Seeing people building thoughtful, sustainable products, services and platforms for the long haul is inspiring. I’m here for it!</p>
<p>I basically just write about and link to anything interesting to me. I’ve learned over and over that if something is interesting to me, there are probably at least a few other people that will be into it too. Publishing stuff online is, in many ways, a signal or beacon that lets other people know you’re into a thing and says, ‘Hey! Me too! Let’s hang out.’</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>RSS is at the heart of my exploration and inspiration. I have thousands of websites and newsletters that come into <a href="https://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>. I love Feedbin and have been using it for many years. I’m constantly pruning feeds, adding new sites and unsubscribing. When I have more time, I’ll skim the main stream, which includes everything I subscribe to. When I have less time, I have a list of about 50 essential sites I skim. Feedbin also allows me to create saved searches that crawl all my feeds and surface posts with specific words or phrases. This is especially handy for tracking something specific, which I almost always do.</p>
<p>I use Golden Hill Software’s lovely <a href="https://www.goldenhillsoftware.com/unread/">Unread</a> app with Feedbin on macOS and iOS. I save lots of links in <a href="https://raindrop.io/">Raindrop</a>, where I keep all my bookmarks. I also queue up articles in <a href="https://read.readwise.io/new">Reader</a>, for highlighting and annotating. Reading gets me thinking. Thinking leads to writing, so I can clarify my thinking. Sometimes, it turns into a blog post. But more often, I’ll write a few sentences with a link on <a href="https://micro.bradbarrish.com/">my microblog</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve solicited feedback from people on posts, but most of them sit in an unpublished state. Editing them to integrate the input becomes a thing that I procrastinate. My interest often shifts or I'll read it so many times that I don't like it anymore. I know this is a thing in talking to other people who write. I have enough self-awareness to know that, generally speaking, the more I noodle on a post, the less likely it is to see the light of day. I open Obsidian, create a new document and write until I get everything I have to say is on the screen. I’ll do my best not to edit myself in this phase. Once I get everything in the document, I’ll lightly edit it to tighten things up. Then it's a simple copy/paste into WordPress’ crappy editor, give it a once-over and smash the publish button.</p>
<p>I use a few tools to write posts. Loose ideas get captured in <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a>. I can go from idea to Drafts quickly on my phone and I like its simple interface. The loose ideas I capture in Drafts make their way into <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> (shoutout <a href="https://stephango.com/">Steph</a>), where I process and write almost everything (including these answers). I’ve used a bunch of other similar apps, but I like how Obsidian works. It's reasonably priced, has an active developer community, and, by all accounts, a sustainable business model. I pay for <a href="https://grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> Premium and mostly like it. I keep it disabled while writing and turn it on when editing. I do feel like there might be something better, and I am actually editing the answers with Hemingway.</p>
<p>While doing all this writing and editing, I listen to instrumental music or fire up Endel. Full disclosure: I made a modest investment when Endel was getting started.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>My ideal creative environment is a small structure with floor-to-ceiling windows, surrounded by nature to which I can teleport. I have a big monitor (at least 4K) connected to an Apple laptop (notifications disabled), on a sturdy desk with an obligatory Aeron Chair. A blazing-fast wireless Internet connection is a must. I'll have all the delicious coffee and fresh food I need. And, of course, a Sonos system for listening to music. Oh, and there’s not another human for miles.</p>
<p>Physical space absolutely influences my creativity, but it can also distract me.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Most of my domains are registered with <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>, which I’ve happily used since 2011. I currently use <a href="http://Wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> to host <a href="https://bradbarrish.com">my main personal blog</a>, which utilizes <a href="https://wordpress.com/theme/sten/bradbarrish.com">Automattic’s Sten theme</a>. I plan to migrate to a <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/install/">self-hosted Ghost instance</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Zap">Zap theme</a> I’ve already set up on an Ubuntu server hosted by <a href="https://vultr.com/">Vultr</a>. My microblog is hosted on <a href="http://Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> and uses the <a href="https://github.com/microdotblog/theme-marfa">Marfa theme</a>. I plan to consolidate everything onto Ghost, which I have unsuccessfully attempted once. Now that <a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/notes-from-migrating/">Matt Haughey’s has shared some notes</a> on the process, I'll give it another whirl soon.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>I would approach things, more or less, the same way I approached it at the dawn of the web, and largely still do. That is to say, I would start writing about anything that was remotely interesting to me without much thought given to the audience. You are your audience, if that makes sense. I would link to and follow others who I admire. And for people I’m especially fond of, I would reach out to them in a non-creepy way (do I even need to say that?) to say hello and express my admiration directly, especially if they are lesser known. Who knows? Your note might be the thing that keeps them going for another day, week or month. Most people don’t do this, by the way. Generosity stands out, especially when it’s not done publicly as some performative act. You might even make some new friends.</p>
<p>Like any Very Internet Person, I have too many domains. And while I’ve often considered having my main site be something other than my name, I’ve used my real name and identity almost everywhere online. I have to admit to being a little envious of people with recognizable pseudonyms or alts, but it all seems like too much work to maintain. I have enough trouble maintaining things. Besides, there’s something freeing (for me) and disarming (for others) about moving fluidly between URL and IRL. Starting a conversation with, “Hey, I’m Brad” is easier.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what&#039;s your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>In short, not a lot. My domain registration, <a href="http://bradbarrish.com">bradbarrish.com</a>, costs me about $16/year on Namecheap. It’s hosted on <a href="http://Wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a>’s least expensive Starter plan, which costs me $3.25/month (billed every two years at $78). It’s an incredible bargain if you don’t have the time or desire to host your domain and are not bothered by its unpleasant backend. <a href="http://Micro.blog">Micro.blog</a> hosts my microblog. I pay for their basic tier, which costs me $5/month and is billed monthly.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, I intend to switch to the Ghost instance I set up with Vultr. It's basically a dev server at the moment and costs me around $3/month. I'm looking forward to having everything on a single, minimalist CMS that I don’t have to futz with often.</p>
<p>I’ve never had any intention or desire to generate money from my blog. That said, I use affiliate links whenever possible, which generate <em>maybe</em> a few hundred dollars in a good year.</p>
<p>It’s lovely that people make a living online from their blog or other creations. I’m proud to financially support bloggers, artists, musicians, journalists, podcasters, indie developers, etc. I’ve probably been paying Kottke the longest of any single blogger. I want to live in a world where people can make a living doing things they love. The more niche and nerdy, the better. Financially supporting people with a few bucks is the simplest way to bring that world about.</p></div>
<div class="q"><p><strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>There are SO many worth checking out. Before I get to a list, I highly recommend checking out <a href="http://blogroll.org">blogroll.org</a> and <a href="https://gossipsweb.net/personal-websites">Gossip’s Web</a> for some remarkable discoveries. Here’s a mix of a few steady essentials and some new discoveries — my vote for who you should interview has Asterisks next to them.</p>

<div class="q"><p><strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong></p></div>
<div class="a"><p>Final question indeed! Where do I even begin?! Ok, I’m literally setting a timer to answer this one. Let’s see… (scrolls through hundreds of open tabs) I love <a href="https://elliot.computer">Elliot Cost</a>’s work a lot, especially <a href="https://special.fish/">Special Fish</a>. I think I learned of Elliot through his work on <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/">The Creative Independent</a>, which was co-founded (I think?) by <a href="https://ystrickler.com/">Yancey Strickler</a>, who turned me on to <a href="https://album.link/i/1700663637">Time Wharp’s Spiro World</a>, which I listen to many times per week. I’m excited about <a href="https://darkforest.metalabel.com/dfc">The Dark Forest Anthology of the Internet</a> being released on <a href="https://www.metalabel.com/">Metalabel</a> (Yancey’s latest thing). <a href="https://johnbengtsson.com/">John Bengtsson</a> designs pretty things. I recently learned about <a href="https://lauren-mccarthy.com/">Lauren Lee McCarthy</a> and have been diving into her work thanks to <a href="https://www.lerandom.art/editorial/lauren-lee-mccarthy-on-software-values">an interview</a> she did with <a href="https://www.gorillasun.de/blog/in-conversation-with-peter-bauman-demystifying-monk-antony/">Peter Bauman</a>. I could watch <a href="https://bleuje.com/">Etienne Jacob</a>’s animations all day. <a href="https://kk.org">Kevin Kelly</a> and <a href="https://craigmod.com/">Craig Mod</a> put together <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/how-to-walk-and-talk/">a booklet that documents the Walk and Talk</a>, which is lovely. Touch grass. My friend Brian <a href="https://www.feelslikefloating.com/">encourages people</a> to touch grass while listening to beautiful music. I may have sent more people to Milan’s amazing <a href="https://milan.cvitkovic.net/writing/things_youre_allowed_to_do/">Things you’re allowed to do</a> post more than anything else online. I read everything <a href="https://sive.rs/">Derek Sivers</a> writes at least once, but often more than once. I love his <a href="https://sive.rs/ti">Tech Independence</a> post for obvious reasons. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr9EPARzXS0&amp;t=334s">Jake Rush</a> made me laugh recently. I like what’s happening at <a href="https://thehtml.review/">the html review</a>. I just finished listening to <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/how-i-built-this/episode/10386-sonos-john-macfarlane/">John MacFarlane’s appearance on the How I Built This podcast</a>, which I really loved. I was fortunate enough to work at Sonos when John was CEO. He was a unique and, in many ways, gifted leader. Sari Azout is doing something quite special with <a href="https://sublime.app/">Sublime</a>, but it’s still early. Paul Graham has written so many great essays, but I recently re-read <a href="https://www.paulgraham.com/words.html">Putting Ideas Into Words</a> and it feels like an especially appropriate thing to share here. I helped put together <a href="https://github.com/riotgoools/viprss">a little thing</a> with <a href="https://riotgoools.com/">riotgoools</a> to get people introduced to RSS in <a href="https://warpcast.com/~/channel/vip">the VIP channel</a> on <a href="https://www.farcaster.xyz/">Farcaster</a>. Even though <a href="https://www.theredhandfiles.com/">The Red Hand Files</a> doesn’t have an RSS feed, I’m happy to visit. I’m quite excited about <a href="https://www.neverpo.st/">Neverpost</a>. The timer went off, so that’s where I will stop.</p>

## 2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?

date: 2024-03-08, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-03-07 Why do we even blog?</h1>

<p>The urge to blog lives in a strange place. One speaks to an imagined audience. It
is not enough to imagine an audience, though. It&rsquo;s more than writing into a
booklet, &ldquo;Dear Diary, …&rdquo; – and yet we do it even if there are no comments.
Sure, I never had a lot of comments. But I think I&rsquo;m just as happy getting the
occasional email or reply on the fediverse. The thought of somebody reading the
words is terrifying. And once I got that first comment, once I started linking
the blog from my profiles, putting it out there for others to find, inviting people to read and
implicitly, to judge… I started discovered that the blog was something I feared.
The blog is a thrill. It makes me nervous. The heart beats. The heart bleeds.</p>

<p>Back when the blog had comments, I used to be anxious about comments. First, there&rsquo;s a
comment. Is it good or bad? Do I read it now? Do I risk a look? But then the
imagined audience is still there and now it&rsquo;s worse. How will I react as I am being watched?
Blogging turns into a performance where I feel like I&rsquo;m demonstrating my moral character. I am
not a racist! I am not a white supremacist! I am not a homophobe! Or am I? All
the discourse online has made me self-conscious. I really
don&rsquo;t want to be what I fear I might be without knowing it. I keep thinking of
the idea that people who aren&rsquo;t very observant being unable to perceive their
own faults. The requirements go up when I learn more.</p>

<p>The effect of all that anxiety, for me, is that I take things seriously. Words
are serious. I try to put my word where my heart is. I try to weight them
carefully. I weigh my heart. Writing is morally intense. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how
long or how short the page, how trivial or how controversial the topic.</p>

<p>And above all of it hangs the grey sky of unspoken words, of thoughts unexamined
and all that maladjustment, all the failures, all the judgements. How often have
I found myself falling short of my own measure.</p>

<p>To blog is to wrestle with that. I imagine an audience that is strangely
interested in all the things I am interested in. I write for them, for me, for
my future self that looks back, the heart full of regret. I struggle for virtue
and I put it into words for you and me, the imagined reader and myself. As proof.
&ldquo;I struggled!&rdquo; I struggle. I keep on struggling to discover what is right and
to do what is right.</p>

<p>Blogging is like writing secret confessions. I write about the things that I
think I did well because I did them wrong and then I changed my mind. I write
about the things I know because I did not know them before. And who cares about
those laborious system administration blog posts where I struggle with this or
that ephemeral problem. All these issues are lost pages. Nobody cares. People
find their answers on Stack Overflow or Reddit or some other centralized
platform where middlemen gamify the experience so that we can help each other
while on the thread-mill for their pockets. And who cares about those blog posts
about growing old or playing games? People read them and move on. Like I do,
when I&rsquo;m reading online. Even if I am moved, I will move on. And there are so
many posts to read, the folders on my disk with saved articles and snippets are
more like compost heaps, where layer upon layer of good stuff gets dropped,
never to see the light of day again.</p>

<p>Perhaps it sparked a thought somewhere, and perhaps that spark starts a fire,
somewhere, much later. There is practically no connection and that is fine. The
world moves and humanity is moved like a dreamer, one thought knows not the
next, and we all partake in that eternal digestion of the sleepless mind. Our
books, our journals, our blogs, our posts, they all participate. Perhaps we
fall for those waves of outrage and the galaxy brain has a seizure as we all
throw our weight around in unison, crushing innocent lives, leaving those we
hurt behind, forgetting them as quickly as we forget about the outrage.</p>

<p>Or perhaps blogging is leaving a trail of blazing sparks, each one sparking a
fire in the next generation. Spending time reading blogs and posts on social
media has certainly changed me.</p>

<p>Perhaps I would have grown older differently without reading blogs and blogging.
And this is why I cannot stop blogging.
To blog in that half-shadow where perhaps our thoughts are read and
perhaps they are not, where every text lights up and shines and drops and sinks
onto that great pile where thousands of text are rotting, that is to participate
in the galaxy brain that is our world. Some of us can vote and some of us can
talk. Some of us can fight and some of us will weep. I try to blog.</p>

<p>I try to blog to prove to myself that it was a struggle, that I tried to think
long and hard about things and that I tried to do the right thing. I keep
failing and so I must keep blogging.</p>

## Biden Announces Drastic Gaza Aid Measure, Warns Against Trump in State of Union Address

date: 2024-03-08, from: VOA News USA

US President Joe Biden used his third State of the Union speech Thursday evening to announce a dramatic measure to facilitate aid into Gaza, push funding for Ukraine’s war efforts and to warn the country of the threat posed by Donald Trump, his likely opponent in the November election. VOA's White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has this wrap-up of what may be the most consequential speech ahead of the president’s reelection bid.

## Biden Targets China During State of Union Speech

date: 2024-03-08, from: VOA News USA

BEIJING — U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday criticized China’s "unfair economic practices" and insisted he has done a better job standing up to Beijing than did former President Donald Trump, his rival in this year’s presidential election.


In his State of the Union address, Biden also touted other aspects of his China policy, including "standing up for peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits" and revitalizing "our partnerships and alliances in the Pacific."


"I’ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can’t be used in China ... frankly for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that," Biden added.


Biden’s China comments, which made up only a brief part of his nationally televised speech, come a day after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi escalated his country’s verbal attacks on the United States.


On the sidelines of an annual meeting of China’s National People’s Congress, Wang accused the United States of trying to contain China through sanctions, and insisted that Washington has "wrong perceptions" about Beijing.


"The means to suppress China are constantly updated, the list of unilateral sanctions is constantly extended, and the desire to inflict punishment on China has reached an unimaginable level," said Wang during what appeared to be a tightly scripted interaction with local and foreign media.


Wang’s comments were a contrast from September, when Biden met Chinese President Xi Jinping in California. At that meeting, both sides agreed to restart dialogue and cooperate on several initiatives, including to counter the flow of fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic opioid, into the United States.


While Wang acknowledged that "some progress" was made at what he called the "historic meeting," he accused the United States of breaking some of its promises.


"If the United States always says one thing and does another, where will its credibility be as a major country? If the United States is nervous and anxious whenever it hears the word 'China,' where is the self-confidence of a major country?" Wang said.


Even as high-level talks resumed, the United States has expanded sanctions against China on a range of issues, from human rights abuses to its relations with Russia. U.S.-China ties are also strained over a wide range of other issues, including China’s behavior in disputed areas of the South China Sea, its military intimidation of Taiwan, and a growing U.S.-China technological competition.


Political cudgel


In his speech Thursday, Biden reiterated that he wants "competition with China, but not conflict," while noting that the United States is "in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st century against China or anyone else for that matter."


"For years, I’ve heard many of my Republican and Democratic friends say that China is on the rise and America is falling behind. They’ve got it backwards ... America is rising," Biden said.


"We have the best economy in the world. And since I’ve come to office, our GDP is up. Our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade," he added.


China is expected to get more public attention as the U.S. presidential election campaign intensifies. On Thursday, both Biden, a Democrat, and U.S. Senator Katie Britt, who delivered the Republican response, used China to attack their political opponents.


"The Chinese Communist Party is undercutting America’s workers. China is buying up our farmland, spying on our military installations, and spreading propaganda through the likes of TikTok," Britt said, referring to the popular video-sharing social media app owned by a Chinese company.


"The CCP knows that if it conquers the minds of our next generation, it conquers America," Britt said. "And what does President Biden do? He bans TikTok for government employees, but creates an account for his own campaign."


U.S. lawmakers are making a renewed push to pass legislation that would effectively force Beijing-based ByteDance to sell TikTok within six months or face a U.S. ban. Some U.S. lawmakers warn ByteDance could pass private information about U.S. users to China’s Communist Party – an allegation rejected by the company’s CEO. Previous attempts to ban TikTok have been unsuccessful.


But despite recent developments, U.S.-China relations remain more stable than in past years, said Wang Huiyao, the founder and president of the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization.


"We don't want to see a downward spiral like we used to have. Because if that happens, that could be very dangerous for not only the U.S. and China, but for the world," Wang told VOA during an interview at his office.


"I’m still cautiously optimistic," Wang said. "Because people realize that [after] the last six, seven years, if the U.S. and China really get into a very ugly situation, then the whole world is finished."

## March 7, 2024 

date: 2024-03-08, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

The Republican Party now belongs to Trump. On the heels of his wins on Super Tuesday, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, his last serious rival for the Republican presidential nomination, suspended her campaign Wednesday morning. That afternoon, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who enabled Trump during his administration but apparently hoped to see him replaced at the top of the party, endorsed him.

## Why Biden Talked Up the IRA Without Saying Its Name

date: 2024-03-08, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTY3NzQyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNjg0MzYxMH0.eeFrNs6N0WwaBF5PtvE7omnwWfKujepY5QXLs9vgSlc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Would the IRA by any other name be as sweet to voters? </p><p>It’s a valid question. President Biden’s final State of the Union address before the November election represented as good a chance as any for him to make his pitch to the American people — and he did so without ever saying the name of his <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self">most significant piece of legislation</a>, the Inflation Reduction Act. </p><p>That might seem like a curious, or even downright disastrous, choice to make regarding a law that has struggled with branding. Though the actual contents of the law are popular with voters, some 63% of Americans say they’ve heard “not much” or “nothing” about the IRA, according to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self">a 2023 Heatmap poll</a>. And while the “Inflation Reduction Act” is only a little more descriptive than “H.R.5376,” the law has been called “<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-inflation-reduction-act-is-called-what-it-is-200054655.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">misnamed</a>” and “<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self">silly</a>” from the start, in large part because it obscures all trace that it is, in actuality, the biggest climate law in U.S. history.</p><p>On Thursday night, Biden appeared to lean into that confusion rather than fight it. Or, perhaps more accurately, he seemed to double down on the avoidance inherent in the law’s very name. Far from giving up on touting the IRA’s accomplishments, Biden repeatedly boasted about “clean energy, advanced manufacturing,” and creating “tens of thousands of jobs here in America.” He further referred to a Stellantis plant in Belvidere, Illinois, that reopened partly due to a federal grant <a href="https://www.chicagobusiness.com/manufacturing-logistics/joe-biden-helped-keep-stellantis-belvidere-plant-open" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">made possible</a> by the IRA. </p><p>Meanwhile, other laws got shout-outs. He cited the CHIPS and Science Act — which rivals the Inflation Reduction Act for dryness. He credited the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for “46,000 new projects … across your communities.” </p><p>It was also notable that the economic upsides of the IRA were largely separated from Biden’s brief mention of “confronting the climate crisis” in the second half of his speech. Just as he’d paid rote attention to childhood literacy initiatives and veteran healthcare, Biden reiterated his established goals like “cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030,” “building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations,” and “conserving 30% of American lands and waters by 2030.” Absent were mentions of consumer incentives, like the IRA making <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/inflation-reduction-act-solar-panels-heat-pumps?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" target="_self">heat pumps, solar panels</a>, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/how-many-evs-ira" target="_self">EVs</a> more accessible. Tellingly, his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/03/07/us/biden-state-of-the-union-updates/d9eef57e-2ecc-54c6-af4a-c1477d3f0714?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lone new climate announcement</a> pertained to a rather minor piece in his more extensive agenda: Biden promised to triple the Climate Corps of young people working in clean energy “in a decade.”</p><p>This divorce of climate change from the economy in the speech is, in actuality, a little like what the name “Inflation Reduction Act” is functionally doing, too. The Biden administration has consistently moved its climate goals forward by not calling attention to the fact that they <em>are</em> climate goals. After all, any Republicans who voted against something called the “Inflation Reduction Act” could be hammered for being — what, <em>pro</em>-inflation?! At the same time, using the State of the Union to draw attention to specific economic accomplishments that<em> just so happen </em>to be in the clean energy space allows Biden to go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump on the economy — an issue voters are more concerned about this election cycle <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/#:~:text=Climate%20change%20is%20a%20lower,and%20reducing%20health%20care%20costs." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">than the climate</a> — without letting such a talking point be dismissed as <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nikki-haley-ron-desantis-fracking-environmentalist-gop-debate" target="_self">green liberal woo-woo</a>.</p><p>Biden can’t avoid talking about climate directly, of course. It’s an issue that is important to young voters, and some progressives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/climate/willow-biden-climate-voters.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worry</a> he’s losing their support over his approval of the <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climate-president-bomb-biden-willow" target="_self">Willow oil drilling project</a>. No wonder, then, that the most prominent part of the State of the Union’s climate section centered on a program explicitly designed to create jobs for 18- to 35-year-olds.</p><p>This isn’t a matter of cynicism — it’s messaging. Admittedly, that is a bit ironic, given that the long-standing criticism of the IRA is that no one knows what it i. Still, Biden is embracing the very spirit of the name of the Inflation Reduction Act by never saying the words.</p>

## US: Stopping Iran’s Resupply of Houthis ‘Most Important’ to Secure Red Sea

date: 2024-03-08, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon   — As attacks by Iran-backed Houthis continue in the Red Sea, the commander in charge of U.S. military operations in the Middle East says the U.S. needs to stop Iran from providing the militants with weapons.


"The most important thing is to deny their ability to resupply from Iran. The Houthis are not building. They're putting it all together and assembling, but they don't create inertial navigation systems. They don't create medium-range ballistic missile engines," Gen. Erik Kurilla, the chief of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.


The U.S. and British militaries have launched multiple combined operations against weapons facilities, radars and launch sites in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The U.S. has also continued near-daily strikes to take out weapons that were prepared to launch and shoot down incoming Houthi weapons, including strikes late Wednesday against two Houthi drones.


An anti-ship ballistic missile launched earlier Wednesday from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen killed three crew members of the Barbados-flagged, Liberian-owned bulk carrier True Confidence in the Gulf of Aden, CENTCOM said in a statement. It was the first fatal strike by Iran-backed Houthi militants since the onslaught on international shipping lanes began in mid-November.


More than a dozen commercial ships have been impacted by Houthi drones or missiles during that time. Those vessels have included an aid ship with grain bound for Yemen and at least one ship with cargo bound for Iran. One vessel carrying fertilizer, the MV Rubymar, sank over the weekend after is was damaged in a Houthi attack last month.


On Tuesday, the Houthis targeted the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Carney, which shot down bomb-carrying drones and one anti-ship ballistic missile, according to CENTCOM.


Some senators on Wednesday expressed a desire for more forceful action against Iran, the Houthis’ supplier of weapons, funding and intelligence needed to attack vessels.


"Why are we not sinking those Iranian ships if there’s an Iranian spy ship providing targeting information," asked Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska.


Gen. Kurilla said that deterring Iran requires a "whole of government" effort.


Last month, the United States carried out a cyberattack against two Iranian military ships. A U.S. official who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity to discuss covert operations said the Iranian spy ship MV Behshad was one of the targeted ships. It had been collecting intelligence on vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.


The Houthis have said their attacks against international shipping lanes are carried out in solidarity with Hamas.


Hamas terrorists launched a brutal attack that killed hundreds of Israelis on October 7. Israel responded with an operation to root out Hamas in the Gaza Strip, an ongoing operation that has killed thousands.


Close calls


Shortly after the attack, Iranian proxies in Iraq and Syria began a series of attacks against U.S. forces in the region. After more than 170 attacks that left dozens of service members injured, the militants flew a drone into Tower 22 air base in Jordan, killing three American service members and injuring dozens more.


Kurilla revealed on Thursday that U.S. forces had "several" close calls before the deadly Tower 22 attack, and that he had balanced the U.S. response options that he provided to the president against escalating the conflict.


Asked by Senator Roger Wicker, the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, whether the militias in Iraq and Syria could have killed U.S. troops prior to the deaths in Jordan with "a little bit of extra luck," Kurilla replied, "That is correct."


"There were several incidents where UAVs (unidentified aerial vehicles) coming into a base hit another object, got caught up in netting, or other incidents where had they hit the appropriate target that they were targeting, it would have injured or killed service members," he said.


VOA previously reported on one of these incidents that occurred in late October. A drone crashed into a barracks housing U.S. services members but failed to detonate, likely saving several lives, according to defense officials.


Threat from Afghanistan


As a result of the attacks on U.S. service members in the region and international shipping lanes, Kurilla said that the U.S. has had to divert intelligence and reconnaissance assets from Afghanistan to Iraq, Syria and Yemen.


He warned that the risk of an attack by violent extremists in Afghanistan on American and Western interests abroad is increasing, saying that Islamic State-Khorasan Province affiliates in Afghanistan and Syria "retain the capability and will to attack U.S. and Western interests abroad in as little as six months and with little to no warning."


The general said such an attack would be more likely in Europe, as it would take "substantially more resources" to hit the U.S. at home.


U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

## US Army Soldier Indicted on Charges of Selling Sensitive Military Information

date: 2024-03-08, from: VOA News USA

nashville, tennessee — An Army soldier has been arrested on accusations of selling sensitive information related to U.S. military capabilities, Justice Department officials said Thursday. 


Sgt. Korbein Schultz, who is also an intelligence analyst, was accused in a six-count indictment of charges including conspiring to obtain and disclose military defense information and bribery of a public official. The 24-year-old was arrested at Fort Campbell, which straddles the Tennessee-Kentucky border, shortly after the indictment was released Thursday. 


"The men and women of the United States Armed Forces dedicate their lives to maintain our national security," Henry C. Leventis, U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, told reporters. "Our laws protecting national defense information are critical to that mission, and they must be enforced. Illegal dissemination of national defense information puts our country, our fellow citizens, members of our military and our allies at risk." 


According to the indictment, Schultz — who had a top-secret security clearance — allegedly had conspired with an individual identified only as "Conspirator A" to disclose various documents, photographs and other national defense materials since June 2022. The indictment said Schultz was recruited by the individual not only because of his security clearance but also because he was tasked with gathering sensitive U.S. military information. 


Some of the information that Schultz is alleged to have given to the individual included information related to the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, hypersonic equipment, studies on future developments of U.S. military forces, and studies on military drills and operations in major countries like China. 


Lessons from Ukraine war


The indictment outlines that Schultz was initially asked to provide documents detailing lessons that could be learned from Russia's war with Ukraine and how those lessons could be applied to the U.S. helping Taiwan in the event of an attack. Schultz was paid $200 for that information, which then prompted Conspirator A, to ask for a "long-term partnership." 


Conspirator A, who was described in the indictment as a foreign national purporting to reside in Hong Kong, later suggested that Schultz could earn more money if he handed over "internal only" material rather than unclassified documents. 


In total, Schultz received at least 14 payments totaling $42,000. 


"The defendant and his co-conspirator also discussed recruiting another member of the U.S. military to join their conspiracy and to provide additional national defense information in order to conceal their illegal conduct," Leventis said. 


Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro said in a statement that Schultz has been in the Army since November 2018 and his hometown is Wills Point, Texas. 


Schultz was previously assigned to Fort Cavazos, Texas, and was deployed once to Eastern Europe, according to Lt. Col. Tony Hoefler, a spokesperson for Fort Campbell. 


The case is the latest in a series of federal prosecutions of current or former military members accused of illegally disclosing sensitive government secrets. 


In April 2023, Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira was charged with leaking highly classified military documents about Russia's war in Ukraine on Discord, a social media platform popular with people playing online games. He pleaded guilty on Monday in a deal with prosecutors that calls for him to serve at least 11 years in prison. 


In August, two U.S. Navy sailors were charged with providing sensitive military information to China — including details on wartime exercises, naval operations and critical technical material. 


And more recently, the Justice Department announced charges this week against a civilian Air Force employee and retired Army lieutenant colonel for allegedly sharing classified information about the war in with Ukraine on a foreign dating site.

## Judge Denies Trump Relief From $83.3 Million Defamation Judgment

date: 2024-03-08, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The federal judge who oversaw a New York defamation trial that resulted in an $83.3 million award to a longtime magazine columnist from Donald Trump refused Thursday to relieve the ex-president from the verdict's financial pinch.


Judge Lewis A. Kaplan told Trump's attorney in a written order that he won't delay deadlines for posting a bond that would ensure 80-year-old writer E. Jean Carroll can be paid the award if the judgment survives appeals.


The judge said any financial harm to the Republican front-runner for the presidency results from his slow response to the late-January verdict in the defamation case resulting from statements Trump made about Carroll while he was president in 2019 after she revealed her claims that he raped her in her memoir.


At the time, Trump accused her of making up claims that he raped her in the dressing room of a luxury Manhattan department store in spring 1996. A jury last May at a trial Trump did not attend awarded Carroll $5 million in damages, finding that Trump sexually abused her but did not rape her as rape was defined under New York state law. It also concluded that he defamed her in statements in October 2022.


Trump attended the January trial and briefly testified, though his remarks were severely limited by the judge, who had ruled that the jury had to accept the May verdict and was only to decide how much in damages, if any, Carroll was owed for Trump's 2019 statements. In the statements, Trump claimed he didn't know Carroll and accused her of making up lies to sell books and harm him politically.


Trump's lawyers have challenged the judgment, which included a $65 million punitive award, saying there was a "strong probability" it will be reduced or eliminated on appeal.


In his order Thursday, Kaplan noted that Trump's lawyers waited 25 days to seek to delay when a bond must be posted. The judgment becomes final Monday.


"Mr. Trump's current situation is a result of his own dilatory actions," Kaplan wrote.


Kaplan said the expense of ongoing litigation does not constitute irreparable injury.


Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, did not immediately comment.


Since the January verdict, a state court judge in New York in a separate case has ordered Trump and his companies to pay $355 million in penalties for a yearslong scheme to dupe banks and others with financial statements that inflated his wealth. With interest, he owes the state nearly $454 million.

## US Navy Looking to S. Korean, Japanese Shipbuilders to Revive American Shipyards

date: 2024-03-08, from: VOA News USA

washington — The United States is looking to Korean and Japanese shipbuilders to help revive its dormant naval shipyards and boost maritime competitiveness in the face of China's accelerated naval buildup.


U.S. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro toured shipyards in South Korea operated by HD Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan and Hanwha Ocean on Geoje Island last week.


He encouraged top executives of the companies to establish subsidiaries and "invest" resources in integrating commercial and naval shipbuilding facilities in the U.S., said a statement by the Navy.


During a speech at Harvard University in September, Del Toro called for "new maritime statecraft" to prevail in an era of intense strategic competition.


South Korean shipbuilding is "an asset" to the U.S. "as China continues to aggressively pursue worldwide shipbuilding dominance," said the Navy statement issued during Del Toro's East Asia visit.


"In addition to our currently active shipyards," it added, "there are numerous former shipyard sites around the country which are largely intact and dormant."


Del Toro said during the tour that these are ready to be redeveloped to produce military and commercial ships.


Yokohama shipyard


Following his visit to South Korea last week, Del Toro traveled to Japan, where he toured Mitsubishi's shipyard in Yokohama and discussed efforts to revive the U.S. maritime industry with leading shipbuilding executives, said the Navy in a separate statement.


Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow for the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said these meetings "underscore a strategic effort by the U.S. to bolster alliance and enhance technological and industrial cooperation" with its allies.


"China may be the world's largest shipbuilder, but South Korea and Japan are number two and three, respectively," continued Funaiole via email on Tuesday.


China has the largest number of naval vessels in the world, having overtaken the U.S. Navy in 2014. According to a Pentagon report published in October, the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) of China has more than 370 battle force ships compared with the U.S. Navy's 292.


The Pentagon report also said that China's navy is expected to have 395 ships by 2025 and 435 by 2030.


According to the U.S. Naval Institute, China commands almost 50% of the global shipbuilding market, with South Korea and Japan following at nearly 30% and 17%, respectively. US capacity is only 0.13 percent.


"It is clear that the United States is having trouble producing ships – both surface ships and submarines – at numbers and costs that can keep up with China's naval modernization," said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Defense Department official during the George W. Bush administration.


"One way to address this shortfall is to work more closely with allies and partners to try and field more vessels or to offload some of the maintenance responsibilities to other players," he told VOA via email on Wednesday.


Protection against competition


But, Cooper said, the opportunities for collaboration "have to be balanced" against the opposition by U.S. shipbuilders that are protected from foreign competitors by the Jones Act.


That act, passed in 1920 in response to German U-boat attacks during World War I that crippled the U.S. Merchant Marine, requires that any vessel carrying goods between two U.S. points be built, owned and crewed by Americans and registered in the U.S.


Terence Roehrig, a professor of national security at the Naval War College, said the U.S. faces a lack of "shipbuilding capacity that can crank out the needed number of vessels at a cost that can be sustained."


He continued via email on Tuesday: "It will be difficult for the U.S. to match the size of the PLAN but the United States retains advantages in technology and weapons systems along with certain classes of ships including aircraft carriers and submarines."


Roehrig added that South Korean and Japanese investment could help the U.S. increase its capacity to keep up with China.


The U.S. Navy currently operates public shipyards in Norfolk, Virginia; Portsmouth, Maine; Puget Sound, Washington; and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Seven public shipyards closed from the 1960s to 1990s.


Seven shipyards owned by four contractors in the U.S. build warships for the Navy while China operates more than 20 shipyards to support naval shipbuilding, according to the U.S. Naval Institute.


Funaiole said: "The gap in shipbuilding capabilities can be attributed to several factors, including China's focused efforts on accelerating military modernization through dual-use applications, strategic prioritization of naval expansion to assert its maritime interests, and effective utilization of its commercial industrial capacity."


He continued that the U.S. should warn its international partners about engaging with Chinese commercial shipbuilders.


"These entities often bolster China's military through its Military-Civil Fusion strategy," which aims to eliminate barriers among commercial, scientific and military sectors to enhance its defense.

## Biden Calls for Defending Democracy in State of Union Address

date: 2024-03-08, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden concluded his State of the Union address Thursday night as he began it: highlighting the importance of defending democracy at home and around the world.


“I see a future where we defend democracy, not diminish it. I see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect other freedoms, not take them away,” Biden said as he wrapped up his speech.


Earlier in the night, Biden began by emphasizing what he said are threats facing democracy around the world and calling on Congress to approve additional aid to Ukraine in its war against Russia.




“I say this to Congress: We have to stand up to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. Send me a bipartisan national security bill,” he said.


House Republicans are blocking a Senate-approved $95 billion foreign aid package that includes $61 billion to help Kyiv in its fight against Russia.


“My message to [Russian] President [Vladimir] Putin, who I’ve known for a long time, is simple: We will not walk away. We will not bow down,” Biden said.


More broadly, Biden said that democracy and freedom are under threat around the world.


“What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack both at home and overseas at the very same time,” he said.


The president also lauded the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, which he called “the strongest military alliance the world has ever seen.”


He pointed out Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, who attended the address as a guest of first lady Jill Biden. Sweden officially joined NATO on Thursday.




Biden took his time walking down the chamber aisle as he stopped to greet, talk and take photos with various lawmakers and other individuals. A collection of attendees began clapping and chanting, “Four more years,” as Biden walked toward the lectern.


The president’s entrance into the chamber was preceded by that of his Cabinet, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, who entered and shook hands with lawmakers as they walked to their seats.


Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona was the designated survivor, which refers to the single member of the president’s Cabinet who does not attend the State of the Union address to ensure that someone in line for presidential succession is safe in the potential event of a catastrophic incident during the address.




Biden’s speech comes as lawmakers work to fund the government and avoid a shutdown, and the Biden administration urges Congress to pass security aid for Ukraine and Israel.


He addressed the ongoing war between Israel and the militant group Hamas near the end of his speech. He called on Hamas to release all of the Israeli hostages still being held by the group.


“I pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring their loved ones home,” Biden said.


But Biden also emphasized that Israel has a responsibility to protect civilians in Gaza. “It’s heartbreaking,” Biden said about the civilian crisis, which has seen more than 30,000 Palestinians killed.


Biden announced that the U.S. military will establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean Sea on the Gaza coast that can receive large ships carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters for civilians in the beleaguered Gaza Strip.


Elsewhere in his speech, Biden drew attention to the Supreme Court’s 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed the right to abortion.


“Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024,” Biden said.


“If Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you: I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again,” he continued.


Several Democratic women are dressed in suffragette white, part of a tradition that began in opposition to former President Donald Trump.


Meanwhile, some Republicans are wearing buttons and T-shirts that reference Laken Riley, the 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia who was killed in February. Authorities charged a Venezuelan migrant who entered the United States illegally and was later released on parole in the case.




Some conservative lawmakers have blamed Riley’s killing on White House immigration policies. During his address, Biden urged Congress to pass the border security fund bill.


“I will not demonize immigrants saying they are ‘poisoning the blood of our country,’” Biden said. “I will not separate families.”


Earlier in his address, Biden took credit for improving the country’s economy and guiding it out of the pandemic-caused slump.


“I came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history. And we have. It doesn’t make the news but in thousands of cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told,” he said.


He went on to cite 15 million new jobs in three years, unemployment at a 50-year low, and a record 16 million Americans starting small businesses.


Biden also committed to protecting the Affordable Care Act.


Also in his sights: halting tax breaks for major corporations and billionaires.


“No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse,” he said, before going on to say he has proposed a minimum 25% tax for billionaires.


Whereas the wars in Ukraine and Gaza featured significantly in Biden’s address, the president only briefly discussed China, which some lawmakers view as an existential adversary to the United States. But Biden projected confidence.


“For years, all I’ve heard from my Republican friends and so many others is China’s on the rise, and America is falling behind. They’ve got it backward. America is rising,” he said.


“We want competition with China, but not conflict,” he added.


Following Biden’s address, Alabama Senator Katie Britt is due to give the Republican response.


Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.

## US-China Science, Tech Pact Is Renewed for Another Six Months

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

State Department — The United States and China have agreed to extend a science and technology agreement for another six months, the U.S. State Department said Thursday.


“The Department of State on behalf of the U.S. government is negotiating to amend, extend and strengthen protections within the U.S.-PRC Science and Technology Agreement (STA). In February 2024, the United States and PRC agreed to an additional short-term six-month extension of the U.S.-PRC STA,” a spokesperson told VOA.


“The short-term six-month extension keeps the agreement in force while we continue negotiations,” the spokesperson added.


U.S. officials have said the STA provides consistent standards for government-to-government scientific cooperation between the U.S. and China.


While the agreement supports scientific collaboration in areas that benefit the United States, U.S. officials acknowledge the challenges posed by China's national science and technology strategies and its domestic legal framework.


Critics, including U.S. lawmakers, point out China’s restrictions on data and a lack of transparency in sharing scientific findings. Washington is also concerned about Beijing's potential military application of shared research.


The STA was originally signed in 1979 by then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter and then-PRC leader Deng Xiaoping.


The agreement has been renewed about every five years since its inception, with the most recent 5-year extension occurring in 2018. Last August, it received a 6-month extension as officials from the two countries undertook negotiations to amend and strengthen the terms.

## A peculiarity of the X Window System: windows all the way down

date: 2024-03-07, from: OS News

Every window system has windows, as an entity. Usually we think of these as being used for, well, windows and window like things; application windows, those extremely annoying pop-up modal dialogs that are always interrupting you at the wrong time, even perhaps things like pop-up menus. In its original state, X has more windows than that. Part of how and why it does this is that X allows windows to nest inside each other, in a window tree, which you can still see today with &#8216;xwininfo -root -tree&#8216;. One of the reasons that X has copious nested windows is that X was designed with a particular model of writing X programs in mind, and that model made everything into a (nested) window. Seriously, everything. In an old fashioned X application, windows are everywhere. Buttons are windows (or several windows if they&#8217;re radio buttons or the like), text areas are windows, menu entries are each a window of their own within the window that is the menu, visible containers of things are windows (with more windows nested inside them), and so on. ↫ Chris Siebenmann This is wild.

## Fedora Workstation 41 to no longer install GNOME X.org session by default

date: 2024-03-07, from: OS News

Fedora Workstation has long defaulted to using GNOME&#8217;s Wayland session by default, but it has continued to install the GNOME X.Org session for fallback purposes or those opting to use it instead. But for the Fedora Workstation 41 release later in the year, there is a newly-approved plan to no longer have that GNOME X.Org session installed by default. ↫ Michael Larabel Expect more and more of the major distributions to abandon X.org completely. For the KDE version of Fedora, X.org will be dropped entirely in Fedora 40 already, so one release earlier.

## US Threatens Action Against Iran at Nuclear Agency Over 'Stonewalling'

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

VIENNA — The United States on Thursday threatened future action against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency if Tehran keeps "stonewalling" the U.N. nuclear watchdog by denying it the cooperation and answers it seeks on issues that include long-unexplained uranium traces. 


At a quarterly meeting of the IAEA’s 35-nation Board of Governors, Washington again told Iran to cooperate with IAEA inspectors who for years have been seeking explanations from Tehran on the origin of uranium particles at undeclared sites. 


The United States has stopped short, for now, of seeking a resolution against Iran. Diplomats have cited the U.S. presidential election in November as a reason Washington has been reluctant to do that. Tehran bristles at such resolutions and often responds by stepping up its activities. 


"We believe we have come to the point that we and the broader international community must consider anew how to respond to Iran's continued stonewalling," the United States said in a statement to the board meeting. "We cannot allow Iran's current pattern of behavior to continue." 


It is now more than a year since the last board resolution against Iran, which ordered it to cooperate urgently with the investigation into the particles. Tehran dismissed the resolution as "political" and "anti-Iranian" even though only China and Russia opposed it. 


The United States and its three top European allies, Britain, France and Germany, again opted against seeking a resolution against Iran at this week's meeting. But the United States said that if Iran did not provide the necessary cooperation soon, it would act. 


"It is our strongly held view that Iran's continuing lack of credible cooperation provides grounds for pursuing further Board of Governors action, including the possibility of additional resolutions and consideration of whether Iran is once again in noncompliance with its safeguards obligations," it said. 


In 2018, then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 deal under which major powers lifted sanctions against Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear activities. After sanctions were reimposed, Iran expanded those activities far beyond the deal's limits. 


It is now enriching uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% that is weapons grade and far above the deal's cap of 3.67%. Western powers say there is no credible civil explanation for enriching to that level, and the IAEA says no country has done so without producing a nuclear bomb. 


Iran says that its aims are entirely peaceful and that it has the right to enrich to high levels for civil purposes.  


The United States said Iran should provide the IAEA with cooperation including access "for the purposes of collecting environmental samples ... and it must begin to do so now."  


If it did not, it would ask IAEA chief Rafael Grossi to provide a "comprehensive report" on Iran's nuclear activities more wide-ranging than his regular quarterly ones, it said. 


"Then, based on the content of that report, we will take appropriate action in support of the IAEA and the global nuclear nonproliferation regime," it said.

## Bitcoin Has a Feel-Good Energy Story

date: 2024-03-07, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTY2MjAwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3Mjk3NzY0N30.aPoKU2w41euESQhPwen8kd1QQtAA6J8mblQo8jWCms0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The price of Bitcoin set a new all time high this week, crossing the $69,000 mark on Tuesday before falling back down to around $67,500 by Thursday afternoon. That almost certainly means Bitcoin’s energy usage is rising, too — although any chance of getting a precise idea of how much, even just in the U.S., may be delayed for months. Last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/crypto-miner-lawsuit-sets-back-us-effort-track-booming-power-use-2024-02-28/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">agreed to stop</a> collecting data on crypto mining operations after a federal court in Texas <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172776308/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172776308.24.0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">put a halt</a> on the project until the EIA goes through a more fulsome approval process. </p><p>That Bitcoin eats up a lot of power is beyond dispute. Bitcoin mining involves solving increasingly complex math problems, which at this point requires vast amounts of computing power; using outside data, the EIA estimated that crypto accounts for around <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/bitcoin-crypto-electricity-consumption" target="_self">2% of the nation’s total electricity use</a>. Both the industry’s electricity usage and how it participates in electricity markets have been subject to <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-green-lawmakers-open-investigation-into-texas-energy-grid-operators-subsidies-to-cryptominers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">criticism from Democratic lawmakers,</a> who have <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/reports/warren-colleagues-call-on-environmental-protection-agency-and-department-of-energy-to-require-cryptomining-companies-to-disclose-energy-use-and-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pushed for more information-gathering</a>. If the price of Bitcoin continues to climb, that skepticism could ratchet up.</p><p>“There is a very direct relationship between the value of what is being mined by the miners and how much is being spent on electricity,” Alex De Vries, a cryptocurrency and energy researcher, told me.<br/></p><p>An extensive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>New York Times</em> investigation</a> last year found that large-scale mining operations were “putting immense pressure on the power grid,” and that “their operations can create costs — including higher electricity bills and enormous carbon pollution — for everyone around them.” According to the University of Cambridge Judge Business School, Bitcoin’s energy consumption has risen about 50% in the past year, from an annualized rate of around 110 terawatt-hours a year <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just over 163 TWh</a>, comparable to the electricity production of Ukraine or Pakistan. (That is, of course, an estimate, based on a model derived from the performance of mining hardware and the assumption that miners only operate with hardware that allows them to mine Bitcoin profitably.)</p><p>With all the attention on consumption and emissions, Bitcoin miners have been eager to portray themselves as, if not quite the goodies, at least not the baddies.</p><p>“The industry as a whole has a good story to tell about the energy piece,” Tom Mapes, president of a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/digital-energy-council-launches-championing-synergy-between-energy-and-bitcoin-crypto-mining" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">newly formed industry group</a> called the Digital Energy Council, told me. He also told me that I “have to be realistic about it. We do use a lot of power — not to say that using power in every facet is bad.”</p><p>The feel-good Bitcoin energy story goes something like this: Crypto miners are always ready to use energy at the right price — and to shut things down at the right price, too. “We have the ability as a bulk power user of our size has the ability to flex load like no another,” Mapes said. “Datacenters cannot flex load like this. We can be built in as a tool to work within constraints of these grids.”</p><p>If a mining facility is co-located with an energy resource, it can be there to purchase power production that might otherwise be curtailed because there isn’t enough transmission capacity to get it to other customers. It can also be a buyer of first resort for a newly developed generator or it can keep an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-miners-are-giving-new-life-to-old-fossil-fuel-power-plants-11621594803" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">old one in business</a>, as Bitcoin mining has with some fossil fuel generators. </p><p>“You tend to see Bitcoin miners anywhere there’s stranded energy and excess power,” said Margot Paez, a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute. There are some examples of crypto mining <a href="https://www.montrosepress.com/free_access/solar-farm-near-olathe-confirmed-as-bitcoin-operation/article_76e751b6-f32b-11ec-8575-f7d05affe945.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">co-located with renewables</a>, but that does not always mean that <a href="https://compassmining.io/facilities/7f16ba9a-33e4-dd15-a7f7-438e015b98cb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the power they use</a> is entirely renewable. There’s also a crypto mining operation set up at a <a href="https://www.power-eng.com/nuclear/aws-acquires-data-center-campus-connected-to-susquehanna-nuclear-station/#gref" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania</a>, adjacent to what will be an Amazon Web Services data center.</p><p>The main way crypto operations interact with the grid is not by supporting any particular resource, though, but rather by being flexible about when they operate. Shutting off when demand is high can be quite lucrative — sometimes even more so than the crypto mining itself. </p><p>Riot Networks, a mining company with extensive operations in Texas and a plaintiff in the EIA record collection suit, has become a flashpoint for crypto’s interaction with the electricity markets precisely because it eagerly shares data with investors and the public about its participation in programs to maintain grid stability. In August, when <a href="https://www.ercot.com/news/release/2023-09-14-ercot-provides-new" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">demand hit record highs</a> and Texas consumers <a href="https://www.ercot.com/news/release/2023-08-17-ercot-issues-voluntary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">were asked to conserve</a> energy, Riot reported $8.6 million in revenue from selling Bitcoins it had mined and $31.6 million either from selling power it had bought for a prearranged price back to the grid at the higher market price or from incentive payments for being willing to power down during demand spikes. </p><p>The company’s chief executive said that last August “was a landmark month for Riot in showcasing the benefits of our unique power strategy.” (Of the 34 large Bitcoin mining operations in the <em>New York Times</em> investigation, Riot was the largest and had the most fossil fuel consumption attributed to it.)</p><p>But that was then and this is now. The revenues Riot is deriving from Bitcoin mining are likely substantially greater than they were five or six months ago, as the price of Bitcoin has almost doubled. The company <a href="https://d2ghdaxqb194v2.cloudfront.net/2865/193123.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has told investors</a> that it costs around $7,500 to mine a single Bitcoin, which could mean that it and other crypto miners operating strategically in the electricity market will be less willing to sell power back to the grid or turn off during demand spikes.</p><p>If you’re thinking this all sounds a lot like the conversation around demand response, well, so was I. Demand response is something climate people love to talk about. They want consumers to get paid for using less power when demand spikes, and they think it’s <a href="https://blinkcharging.com/demand-response-management-for-evs/#:~:text=Electric%20vehicle%20demand%20response%20programs,the%20grid%20and%20mitigating%20blackouts." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">really neat</a> that you can charge an electric car overnight when demand is low and want you to be able to sell that power back to the grid when demand gets high.</p><p>Putting energy consumers near renewables and other non-carbon-generating energy sources that can absorb excess power when renewable production is “too high” for the grid is something you hear about a lot with, say, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030626192300380X#:~:text=Hydrogen%20production%20through%20water%20electrolysis,of%20balancing%20supply%20and%20demand." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hydrogen production</a> or<a href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/energy-storage-smooths-duck-curve" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> energy storage</a>. Why let that energy go to waste when we could incentivize people to store it, instead?</p><p>But an electrolyzer or a battery is not just a clever way to figure out how to deal with the peaks and valleys of variable renewable energy resources like wind and solar, it’s also potentially a key component of a decarbonized energy system. It doesn’t just consume non-carbon energy, it can store and transfer carbon-free energy as well. </p><p>Crypto, on the other hand, takes energy, renewable or not, and turns it into money. It’s a greedy and flexible consumer of electricity, and there are market designs where non-carbon generators would be happy to work with such a consumer. But from the perspective of the energy system, a consumer is all it will ever be.</p>

## 20 Years Ago: First Image of Earth from Mars and Other Postcards of Home

date: 2024-03-07, from: NASA breaking news

On March 8, 2004, the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit took the first image of Earth from the surface of another planet. The Earth appearing as nothing more than a bright star provided a new perspective on our home planet, a perspective reshaped over the past eight decades as cameras aboard rockets and spacecraft traveled farther [&#8230;]

## NASA, US Navy Prepare Astronauts for Moon Mission

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

San Diego, California — The USS San Diego is a warship designed to deliver troops and equipment into combat zones, something the crew routinely trains for from their base in San Diego, California, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.


But a closer look at the patches and colors of some of the uniforms on board recently are clues that one of their current missions has objectives about as far away from a theater of war as one can get.


“This is a unique opportunity, but this is well within the wheelhouse of what we do day in and day out,” says Lieutenant Jackson Cotney, a U.S. Navy helicopter pilot attached to the USS San Diego conducting search and rescue training operations supporting NASA’s Artemis crewed missions to the moon.




During recent exercises in the Pacific Ocean, Cotney and hundreds of sailors worked with NASA’s four-person Artemis II crew to prepare for a critical part of the complex operation — the safe return and recovery of the Orion capsule and crew once it completes reentry through Earth’s atmosphere.


“This is the 11th underway recovery test,” but the first with astronauts engaged in the training, explains Captain David Walton, who is the commanding officer of the USS San Diego. “Once the crew comes back, really their health and welfare is our number one concern. Getting them out of the capsule and getting them medical treatment rapidly is what we’re driving for, and then recovering the equipment for further flights back to the moon or further.”


Cotney is already an Artemis veteran. He piloted one of the helicopters monitoring the uncrewed Orion capsule that touched down in the Pacific Ocean at the end of the 25-day Artemis 1 mission in 2022, which orbited the moon and traveled the farthest into space of any craft designed to carry humans.


“We were the first platform up at 10,000 feet to see that the capsule was intact as it came over the horizon,” he told VOA during a recent interview on board the San Diego. “Super exciting to see it come out of the sky. This mission itself is new to me, but not new to naval aviation. Naval aviators and the naval helicopter community have been rescuing astronauts, picking up astronauts out of the water since the early Apollo days.”


Although NASA has delayed the launch of a crewed mission to orbit the moon until 2025 at the earliest, it has already selected four astronauts for the first such journey in more than 50 years.


“This Artemis mission campaign is not just about going back to the moon and going back responsibly and sustainably, it’s about building on what we learned there and exploring even deeper and answering some of those fundamental questions that we all have about ourselves,” says Christina Koch, who could make history as the first woman to orbit the moon. “What does it mean to be human, are we alone in the universe, how did we all get here?”




Speaking at a press conference at the conclusion of their session aboard the San Diego, Koch said the training isn’t preparing them just for a path already forged by astronauts five decades ago. It’s helping them compete in a new “space race,” in which the United States isn’t the only country with aspirations beyond Earth’s orbit.


“The question really isn’t why we go; it’s are we going to lead or are we going to follow. To see this team work together and innovate to come up with a unique solution for getting four people out of the Pacific Ocean, the answer was very clear to me that we are going to be leading,” he says.


“Space kind of got back to being cool,” says Lieutenant Derek Pelletier, who, along with most of the crew of the San Diego, wasn't alive the last time people reached the moon. But they know their role in this training is one small step in NASA’s greater leap in the Artemis program that doesn’t stop on the lunar surface.


“The next step is going to be to Mars and beyond, so knowing that we played a part in getting humanity back to the moon and out to the space frontier is going to be fantastic to us, so the importance that we feel as a crew is great,” he says.


NASA astronauts Koch, Reid Wiseman and Victor Glover and Canada’s Jeremy Hansen could orbit the moon as early as September 2025. The return of astronauts to the lunar service is scheduled for the following mission — Artemis III — which NASA plans to launch in 2026.

If blogging does come back now, it'll have features it didn't have last time we were really working on it. The reason is cheap servers, we know how to use them, and the software is already written. You'll get a chance to see how that works in a matter of days now, Murphy-willing of course.

## Mukkpet Tank review: How good is a super low-cost full-suspension fat tire e-bike?

date: 2024-03-07, from: Electrek Feed

<div class="feat-image"><img src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/mukkpet-tank-header.jpg?quality=82&#038;strip=all&#038;w=1600" /></div><p>Full-suspension and fat tires are basically the holy grail of comfort when it comes to e-bikes. They’re excessive in many situations, but that doesn’t stop a large swath of new e-bike shoppers looking for both. The only problem is they both tend to add to the cost of an e-bike, often pushing the number into the $2k range or higher. But what if you could get a full-suspension fat tire electric bike for under a thousand bucks? That’s what the Mukkpet Tank offers, and so I was excited to test it out and see how good it could be.</p>

## Companies need to calculate risks as the climate changes

date: 2024-03-07, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission passed new rules this week requiring public companies to disclose climate-related risks to investors. The rules are meant to standardize reporting requirements on things like emissions and exposure to climate change-related disasters. We unpack. Also: When will the Fed cut rates? Senators are likely to put Jay Powell on the spot when he testifies. And New York Community Bancorp gets a $1 billion injection from investors.</p>

## Will Climate Get a SOTU Shout Out?

date: 2024-03-07, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Red flag fire warnings are in place across West Texas • Heavy rainfall caused extreme flooding in parts of West Java • Tourists in Morocco are disappointed to find the country’s public baths have been <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ca3d3b1963&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">closed</a> three days a week due to severe drought.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
1. Biden urged to highlight climate wins in SOTU 
</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Happy State of the Union day! President Biden will address Congress this evening, just as election season gets going in earnest, and some in his party are urging him to use the opportunity to make a Very Big Deal of his progress in the clean energy transition, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e2e035a5b9&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> <em>E&E News</em>. “We have a great story to tell,” Environment and Public Works Chair Tom Carper (D-Del.) said. “He has to tell it. We have to tell it. Eventually it will break through.” Some recent polls suggest that most Americans aren’t aware of Biden’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and may consider Biden’s likely rival, former President Donald Trump, to be best positioned on issues like energy and economy. “Climate voters could make or break Joe Biden in 2024,” Nathaniel Stinnett, executive director of the nonprofit Environmental Voter Project, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f9f392d286&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a><em> The New York Times</em>. The Natural Resources Defense Council <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=bbd761700e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> the speech is “a chance for Biden to rally the nation around the climate progress of the past three years and show the way to build on those gains going forward.” Will he make the most of it? TBD.
</p><h3>
2. New SEC climate disclosure rules blasted as both too harsh and too weak
</h3><p>
	As expected, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a rule yesterday that will require companies to disclose information about their climate-related risks to investors. But the final rule differs dramatically from the proposal the Commission released two years ago, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=65c1db1285&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained <em>Heatmap</em>’s Emily Pontecorvo</a>, with significantly weaker provisions that leave it up to companies to decide how much information to share. Most of the climate-related disclosures the rule covers are now mandatory only if they’re considered “material.” Further, only about 40% of domestic public companies will even be required to consider whether their emissions are material. Smaller companies and emerging growth businesses — generally companies with less than $1.2 billion in annual revenues — are exempt.
</p><p>
Though the final rules are weaker than the original draft, they’re still too stringent for some. At least 10 Republican-led states are 
	<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dd9eea2628&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">suing the SEC</a>, accusing the Biden administration of playing “puppeteer” in using states to further a climate agenda. Meanwhile the Sierra Club environmental group might sue the SEC because it thinks the rules aren’t strict enough. An SEC spokesperson said the agency will “vigorously defend” the rules in court.
</p><p>
	Also yesterday, 25 states, along with industry groups, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9eccac396b&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">filed three lawsuits</a> against the Environmental Protection Agency for its recent crackdown on soot pollution.<br/>
</p><h3>3. February warmth breaks records </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Last month was the warmest February ever recorded, the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3594b2cdfb&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">said</a> today. This marks the 9th record-breaking month in a row, and the effects were felt world wide. Temperatures in Europe, for example, were 5.9 degrees Fahrenheit above averages seen between 1991 and 2020. But even more startling was the <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=270645e58f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ocean temperature</a>, which was higher last month than it was last August.

	“Sea surface temperatures are at record levels over regions far away from the centre of the El Niño action, such as the tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=78874e029d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> climate scientist Richard Allan of the University of Reading, suggesting climate change was playing a big part in heating the ocean heat.
</p><h3>4. Strong global gusts could set new wind-power records</h3><p>
<strong></strong>Wind speeds in China, Europe, and the U.S. are expected to hit seasonal peaks in the coming weeks, which could result in record wind-power output, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0e9ca9b756&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>. In both the U.S. and China, last year’s spring wind power hit new highs in terms of share of total electricity generation. In the months since, both countries have added more wind generation capacity, which means new records are likely. Wind’s share of global electricity generation peaked at 9.59% in November of last year, and could jump beyond 10% “easily” in 2024, <em>Reuters</em> said.

The report looked at 75 of the largest retailers, including Target, Walmart, Trader Joe’s, and 7-Eleven and found that charging is available on average at 1 out of every 14 big box store locations, 1 out of every 15 grocery stores, and 1 out of every 40 department stores. “These results show that there is no retail category where a driver can be confident that an EV charger will be available,” the report concludes. This is despite the fact that installing EV chargers has been shown to increase both foot traffic and revenue for retail shops. Here’s a look at how charging availability breaks down by big box brands:

## Build Your Own Decentralized Dropbox with Syncthing

date: 2024-03-07, from: mrusme blog

In the world of file synchronization, most people are familiar with services
like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. These centralized cloud solutions are
convenient but come with privacy concerns and potential security risks.
What if I told you that to synchronize files between individual devices, you
don't need *the cloud&trade;* ?

## Under the Weather: The National Security Risks from Climate Change Could Go Well Beyond What the U.S. Government Thinks

date: 2024-03-07, updated: 2024-03-07, from: RAND blog

Climate change has at least two characteristics that are likely to drive second- and third-order political and social reactions whose effects on U.S. strategic interests may be substantially greater than those that occur in direct reaction to individual extreme weather events.

## WANDERLUST

date: 2024-03-07, from: Howard Jacobson blog

He saw her first - no he didn&#8217;t: he beheld her first - in the library of St Ursula&#8217;s College, a grammar school in North Manchester which had agreed to let him research its holdings of once venerated textbooks. Her head appeared above the stacks like that of a browsing giraffe. She even swivelled her jaw as though chewing on an acacia leaf. That was a tic he would come to hate &#8211; as for example when it accompanied a confession that she loved another man, or another woman, or both - but at first it beguiled him. It suggested the absent-mindedness of a person who was always somewhere else. She caught his gaze and smiled at him.

Also does he feel it's fair for a prosecutor to use his public platform to smear the reputation of an innocent person? And finally if there is no respect for the president as a person, what about the office, and the country the president serves? Does he have any respect for that?

## Guestbooks are cool

date: 2024-03-07, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>As I mentioned in a previous post, this site now has a <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/guestbook">guestbook</a>. But, as someone pointed out, I didn’t explain what the heck a guestbook is. I thought it was pretty self-explanatory but I think it’s worth writing a post about it anyway. On the <a href="https://indieweb.org/guestbook">IndieWeb website</a>, guestbooks are defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a way to allow visitors to your site to leave a comment about the website as a whole, instead of a comment about a specific post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it’s a good definition. Guestbooks are a relic of a different time, back when the web wasn’t dominated by social media and interactions among people moved at a different pace. A guestbook is like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_register">summit book</a>, in a way. It’s something you can use to leave a trace of your presence.</p>
<p>But what do you write on the guestbook? Whatever you want. You can let me know how you landed here, you can use it to suggest a topic, or you can use it to just say hi. Just be kind and respectful.</p>
<p>I first toyed with the idea of adding a guestbook almost a year ago, after stumbling on <a href="https://sarajoy.dev/guestbook/">Sara Joy’s website</a>. I don’t remember how or why I was there but I loved the guestbook and it took me almost a year to finally code mine.</p>
<p>And I’m happy to see that <a href="https://kevquirk.com/i-have-a-guestbook">Kev</a> now has one on his site as well! If you decide to add a guestbook to your site send me an email, and I’ll be happy to come sign it.</p>                <hr>
                <h2>Get in touch</h2>                <p>Have something to share? Want me as your <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/i-ll-read-it">first reader</a>? Get in touch. My inbox is always open.</p>                <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">Connect</a> —

## China Criticizes US for Suppressing Its Rise While Touting Partnership With Russia

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

TAIPEI, TAIWAN    — Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi Thursday criticized the United States for trying to suppress China’s rise through sanctions and reiterated Beijing’s commitment to uphold the multipolar world order with partners such as Russia.


Speaking to local and foreign media during the annual meeting of China’s rubber-stamp parliament, Wang said while relations between China and the United States have improved since the summit between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November, Washington’s misconception of China remains strong and it has not honored the promises made during the summit.


“The U.S. continues to renew their means of suppressing China while expanding the sanctions list,” he said, adding that Washington’s desire to punish Beijing has reached an “unimaginable level.”


Questioning Washington’s credibility as a great power, Wang urged the U.S. to view China’s rise and development objectively and rationally handle its interactions with Beijing.


“We urge the U.S. to recognize the general trend of historical development and put its promises into practice,” Wang added.




Some analysts say Wang’s criticism of the U.S. reflects Beijing’s concern about facing technological bottlenecks and economic encirclement by Washington and its allies.


“Beijing is hoping to elicit further American concessions and it’s asking the U.S. to lower its walls on technological de-risking from China,” Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at Australian National University told VOA in a written response.


While Wang urged the U.S. to promote a healthy and stable development of bilateral relations alongside China, he touted Beijing’s close partnership with Russia, saying both countries continue to deepen political mutual trust while pursuing mutually beneficial cooperation.


“As major world powers and permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China, and Russia have forged a new paradigm of great power relations that adheres to permanent good neighborliness while deepening comprehensive strategic cooperation on the basis of nonalignment, nonconfrontation and nontargeting of third parties,” Wang said.


Some experts say China’s efforts to double down on its “no limits partnership” with Russia is mainly due to its attempt to build an alliance that can resist pressure imposed by the United States.


“Since Russia is anti-U.S., China needs an ally to help it resist pressure from Washington,” Liu Dongshu, an expert on Chinese politics at the City University of Hong Kong, told VOA by phone.


Since China has been highlighting the importance of its partnership with Russia before the Ukraine war, Liu said China may feel the need to stick with that commitment.


“It’s difficult for Beijing to admit that it’s made a mistake in being too supportive of Russia, so for the sake of saving its face, China needs to insist that it’s not wrong for maintaining the partnership with Russia,” he added.


As the war in Ukraine and the Middle East continue, Wang, a 70-year-old veteran diplomat who returned to the role of foreign minister last year following the mysterious dismissal of former Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang, said China is actively putting forward proposals for resolving regional and global issues.


He said the only way to end the vicious cycle extended from the conflict between Israel and Hamas is to “comprehensively implement the two-state solution” and said Beijing supports establishment of a Palestinian U.N. member state.


On the Ukraine war, Wang said China has always “maintained an objective and impartial position” and reiterated Beijing’s support for convening an international peace conference that is recognized by both Russia and Ukraine.


Liu in Hong Kong said China is facing a dilemma where it wants to present itself as a responsible great power internationally, but it doesn’t want to take action to address the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.


“Unlike the U.S., which has experience in mediating global conflicts, China has long adopted this nonintervention approach,” he told VOA. “China is unwilling to take actions to get involved in these conflicts and it also may not be capable of doing that.”


Amid rising tension across the Taiwan Strait in recent weeks, with Chinese coast guard vessels increasing efforts to patrol disputed waters near Taiwan’s outlying islands, Wang said Beijing will never allow Taiwan to be separated “from the motherland” and warned countries around the world not to support Taiwan’s potential pursuit of independence.


“Whoever engages in ‘Taiwan independence’ on the island will be held accountable by history and whoever in the world supports ‘Taiwan independence’ will get burned for playing with fire and taste the bitter fruit of their own doing,” he warned during the 90-minute press conference.


Sung from Australian National University said Wang’s comments on Taiwan are intended to intensify pressure on Taiwan’s diplomatic partners and ensure Taiwan remains internationally isolated. Wang is trying to “warn other countries about the consequences of offering support for Taiwan while reiterating Beijing’s ultimate goal of achieving unification,” he told VOA.


As tension between China and the Philippines grows because of repeated confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the disputed South China Sea, Wang said China has always exercised “a high degree of restraint” when handling maritime disputes.


“China has always respected historical and legal facts and sought a solution that’s acceptable to each party,” he said, adding that Beijing will not allow its “good intentions” to be abused or the law in the sea to be “distorted.”




After Wang set the tone for China’s foreign policy in 2024 through the press conference on Thursday, some analysts think Beijing will likely adopt a multiprong approach to manage its relationship with different countries.


“China will focus on managing ties with Europe, maintaining close relations with Russia and other pariah states, heightening tensions with Taiwan, India and in the South China Sea, cautiously testing the waters with the U.S. while seeking to court the Global South,” Sana Hashmi, a postdoctoral a fellow at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation, told VOA in a written response.

## March 6, 2024 

date: 2024-03-07, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Black Americans outnumbered white Americans among the 29,500 people who lived in Selma, Alabama, in the 1960s, but the city&#8217;s voting rolls were 99% white. So, in 1963, Black organizers in the Dallas County Voters League launched a drive to get Black voters in Selma registered. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, a prominent civil rights organization, joined them.

## Biden to Address Nation as Two Wars Rage Abroad

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The State of the Union address is traditionally the venue where American presidents highlight domestic successes, and President Joe Biden is expected to discuss his handling of the economy, reproductive rights, gun control, and immigration Thursday evening.


But as the United States deals with wars in the Middle East and Europe, foreign policy may be higher on the agenda in Biden’s fourth, and potentially final, such speech to a joint session of Congress.


The president intends to highlight his achievements in “restoring American leadership on the world stage,” John Kirby, White House national security communications adviser, told VOA during an interview on Wednesday.


American leadership, he added, gives it the ability to influence actions of world leaders and adversaries “in ways that are more in keeping with our national security interests.”




That influence has failed to overcome stark differences between Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on issues including how to deliver more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza, the postwar role of the Palestinian Authority and the U.S. vision for a future Palestinian state.


On Ukraine, American leadership is overshadowed by House Republicans’ obstruction of a Senate-approved $95 billion foreign aid package that includes $61 billion to support Kyiv in its fight against Russia. The bill also includes $14 billion in security assistance for Israel, $9 billion in humanitarian assistance and $5 billion to support partners in the Indo-Pacific, as Washington competes against Beijing for regional influence.


The wars in Ukraine and Gaza will be prominently featured in the foreign policy portion of Biden’s speech, as will the U.S. strategic rivalry with China. Analysts say the president will employ different approaches on the two issues as he considers voters’ sentiments ahead of his bid for reelection in November.


Push for Ukraine aid


Biden will use his address to again call for the passage of the foreign aid bill and argue that it is not in America’s interest to embrace isolationism amid signs of growing Russian expansionism.


“The president is going to continue to make his case that House Republicans need to move forward. The speaker needs to put the national security supplemental on the floor,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during her briefing Wednesday. “We know that it would get overwhelming support.”


While the Biden administration has gathered international support for an effort that includes substantial military and economic aid to Ukraine, major sanctions on Russia and greatly increasing NATO’s military posture in eastern Europe, it has failed to provide a strong case for this policy for the American people, said John Herbst, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine who is now senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center.


“This in turn has made it easier for naïve voices, especially in the one corner of the Republican Party to block the assistance Ukraine needs to avoid a defeat,” Herbst told VOA.


Vanderbilt University presidential historian Thomas Schwartz predicted Biden “will go all in” on Ukraine, particularly in light of the recent death of Alexey Navalny in a Siberian prison. The Russian dissident’s death has intensified U.S. views that supporting Ukraine’s efforts to push back against Russian President Vladimir Putin is “a real moral cause,” Schwartz told VOA.


“This will also allow him to draw a sharp contrast with Trump, who has, of course, expressed admiration for Putin in the past and has not been as supportive on the Ukraine issue,” Schwartz added.


Polls show that Americans’ support for sending military aid to Kyiv is fractured along party lines, with voters of the president’s party largely sympathetic to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s war efforts.


According to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, 67% of Democrats see it as a priority for the U.S. government to prevent Russia from gaining more territory in Ukraine and to help Ukraine regain territory that is currently occupied by Russia. Only 37% of Republicans agree.


Biden will use his address to rally support amid Americans’ war fatigue. Overall, 37% of respondents — 55% of Republicans and 17% of Democrats — say the U.S. government is spending too much on aid to Ukraine.




Tread carefully on Gaza


The president is likely to tout his immediate support for Israelis following Hamas’ October 7 attack and underscore the importance of ensuring that Israel can defend itself against the U.S.-designated terror group’s threats.


But he will need to tread carefully on the issue, taking into account the division between pro-Israel Democrats and independents who support his stance on the conflict and progressive Democrats, as well as Arab and Muslim Americans, who are angered by it.


Outrage over the more than 30,000 people killed in Gaza and Biden’s refusal to put conditions on U.S. military aid for Israel has resulted in significant portions of Democratic primary election voters in Michigan and Minnesota marking their ballots “uncommitted” to signal their protest and demand an immediate and permanent cease-fire.


Negotiators have not yet been able to bring the fighting in Gaza to a halt ahead of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which begins this weekend. On Tuesday, Biden said the fate of the temporary cease-fire deal is in the “hands of Hamas” after Israel agreed to a “rational offer” that had been put on the table.


Hamas has since responded saying there can be no hostage exchange without a permanent cease-fire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The group accused Israel of stalling the talks.


Israeli politicians will be carefully watching Thursday to see who Biden blames for the deadlock and how critical he is of Israeli efforts to protect and deliver aid to Palestinian civilians, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the Department of Political Studies at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University.


As Biden is likely to reiterate his call for a two-state solution, Israelis will be anxious to see whether he calls on Israel to “present a clear vision that includes a Palestinian state,” Rynhold told VOA. “I doubt he'll do it, but if he does, it's bad for Netanyahu but not bad for the war.”




Biden is likely to focus his criticisms on the far-right elements within the Israeli government and signal displeasure at violence committed by what he calls “extreme settlers” in the West Bank, as he has done several times in the past.


Kirby said the president will also call for increasing humanitarian aid for Palestinians. With the Netanyahu government’s refusal to open more land crossings for aid convoys and the death of more than 100 people after Israeli troops opened fire as desperate Palestinians mobbed a convoy of food trucks, the U.S. has resorted to using military aircraft to drop supplies — a more expensive, inefficient and dangerous means to deliver aid.


A Gallup poll released this week shows 58% of Americans hold a favorable view of Israel, down from 68% last year, and the lowest favorable rating for the country in over two decades.

## How to Have Sex (2023)

date: 2024-03-07, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>Last August, Vivian took me to see the film <cite>How to Have Sex</cite>, which was screening at the Astor as part of the <abbr title="Melbourne International Film Festival">MIFF</abbr>. What Viv did <em>not</em> warn me of adequately before we saw the film was that it&rsquo;s about an eighteen-year-old girl who gets much too drunk and loses her virginity in a sexual encounter that was fundamentally not consensual but also difficult to describe as &ldquo;rape&rdquo;, and as someone who basically <em>was</em> that eighteen-year-old girl a long time ago I&rsquo;d <em>really</em> have appreciated more of a heads-up about that. Watching the film dredged up a <em>lot</em> of long-buried bitterness in me, and truth be told, all these months later I still haven&rsquo;t successfully buried it again. I have been told, of course, that &ldquo;burying trauma isn&rsquo;t the same as dealing with trauma,&rdquo; which honestly I would like to call bullshit on because when my trauma was buried, I felt fine, and now it&rsquo;s been resurrected, I don&rsquo;t, and on the surface that seems to me like a regression.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> To be fair, I don&rsquo;t think Viv looked that deeply into the movie; I think he saw &ldquo;eighteen-year-olds having sex on holiday&rdquo; and went, &ldquo;Sounds amazing, sign me up.&rdquo; Anyway, what&rsquo;s done is done.  Apparently, the film&rsquo;s just entered general release here (<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-06/how-to-have-sex-molly-manning-walker-cannes/103481472" title="ABC News: Molly Manning Walker&#39;s feature debut How to Have Sex explores consent and sex through the eyes of teens">see ABC article<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>), so I thought I&rsquo;d dust off this long-stalled draft and try to polish it up.</p>
<p>The filmmaker herself, Molly Manning Walker, was actually in attendance on that night in August, and there was a Q&amp;A with her after the screening. That was really good in and of itself, and I&rsquo;m glad we stayed for it. She described her film as (along these lines) &ldquo;a very personal story, and one that a lot of people relate to,&rdquo; and made the excellent point that our conversations about consent need to be more nuanced, which I agree with wholeheartedly. She said that &ldquo;the law, which doesn&rsquo;t protect us anyway&rdquo; has its own legal standard for what sexual assault is, but it&rsquo;s such a high bar to clear, and it doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything that falls short of that bar is A-OK and acceptable. So, she said, &ldquo;since the law doesn&rsquo;t protect us anyway,&rdquo; we should move to using our own definitions and having our own conversations about consent, which should be human-focused and centre &ldquo;people just having a good time&rdquo;. People shouldn&rsquo;t just think to themselves, &ldquo;Is this <em>literally rape?</em>&rdquo; but, &ldquo;How can I make sure this other person has a good experience?&rdquo; This is a much more important question.</p>
<p>Another thing she talked about is the need to reach out to people (and <abbr title="Let's Be Real">LBR</abbr>, mostly men) who are currently engaging in these kinds of coercive, pushy, or not-entirely-consensual sexual practices, and how you&rsquo;ll never actually reach them – you&rsquo;ll repel them and they won&rsquo;t listen – if you brand them &ldquo;rapists&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil scum&rdquo; or whatever. (Even though, I&rsquo;ll admit, I&rsquo;ve succumbed to this temptation myself.) She talked about a meeting she went to with French film distributors who were considering screening this film, and said that one of the men had watched the film and come to the realisation that: &ldquo;I am Paddy.&rdquo; (Paddy being the pushy, manipulative dickhead in the film. And yes, OF COURSE it would be a Frenchman in her anecdote, of course.) She said that while on one level it&rsquo;s obviously shit that he has been a Paddy, it&rsquo;s good that he&rsquo;s been able to come to that realisation and one can only hope that he won&rsquo;t be a Paddy in the future. My experience with my own &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; leads me to believe it&rsquo;s not <em>nearly</em> as simple as that, but generally speaking I think it&rsquo;s true: there needs to be a &ldquo;way back&rdquo; for people who have been insensitive or, you know, coercive, or sexually cruel, or whatever you could say. There&rsquo;s a huge stigma around &ldquo;being a rapist&rdquo;, for good reason obviously and it&rsquo;s clearly better than society being OK with rapists, but it&rsquo;s just so profoundly unhelpful to have this binary where behaviour is either &ldquo;rape&rdquo; <em>or</em> it&rsquo;s completely fine, or where men are either &ldquo;rapists&rdquo; – forever – <em>or</em> totally innocent. There has to be a way to say, &ldquo;What you did was unacceptable, but you can learn from it; it doesn&rsquo;t have to define you forever.&rdquo; Assuming he actually wants to learn, of course, but convincing such men to want to learn was one of Manning Walker&rsquo;s goals with the film.</p>
<p>In the critical scene of <cite>How to Have Sex</cite>, the protagonist – Tara – gets separated from her friends during a night&rsquo;s partying and winds up alone on a beach with Paddy, who gets increasingly physical and pushy before pressuring her to have sex with him. Very drunk, and vulnerable, she agrees, but her body language makes it clear it&rsquo;s really not what she wants. As the ABC article quotes her saying, Manning Walker finds it interesting the split reactions she gets about what actually happened in that scene:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lots of women would come into the room and say &rsquo;thank you for making this film, I&rsquo;ve been through that, I feel seen&rsquo;, and a lot of men would come in quite defensive and say, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not an assault because she said yes&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I may not have got to tell her so personally, but I absolutely would&rsquo;ve been among those women. Because that really is the critical point&hellip; in the moment, she said yes! So did I, to my everlasting shame. I said more, even, but not because I wanted to. Because I felt trapped, and scared, and I was always way too much of a people-pleaser. I was so afraid I&rsquo;d upset him, because I <em>did</em> really like him, and I didn&rsquo;t want to screw my chances for the future when the situation might actually have felt right. My skin was crawling the entire time, my mind buzzing with a million and one reasons why I was a fucking idiot to have even landed myself there. I could never fully, or even mostly, blame myself – after all, he was the one who stripped me of my clothes without so much as a word when I was frozen up in panic, and there was a <em>huge</em> imbalance in power and experience between us that did not favour me. But of course I blamed myself, in part.</p>
<p>So was that rape, or was it not? Believe me, I endured a truly exhausting number of arguments both ways, to the point that I really want never to have to try to address that question again. The Q&amp;A with the filmmaker was really excellent because it gave me the liberating answer: <em>it doesn&rsquo;t fucking matter</em>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it was <em>technically</em> rape, or whether I <em>technically</em> consented, or at what exact point of drunkenness one is <em>technically</em> too drunk to consent, or whether there&rsquo;s some kind of sliding scale whereby you can be partially, but not fully, responsible for &ldquo;consenting&rdquo; against your better judgement. Literally none of the bullshit I had to fight about, over and over again, matters at all. The only thing that matters is &ldquo;people having a good time&rdquo;. And by that metric, he utterly failed.</p>
<p>The problem is, I don&rsquo;t think we have good language for it, this kind of callous sexual behaviour that, perhaps, falls short of being rape. The protagonist of the film is never really able to find the words for what happens to her; at most, I remember her saying weakly, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t really count though.&rdquo; I remember trying to use that same line myself, once, with someone who was trying to &ldquo;YEAHHH YOU GETTEM GIRL&rdquo; me just like Tara&rsquo;s shitty friend was at that point in the film. But in my case, I also had other people – <strong>so many people</strong><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> – arguing with me very sternly that if I was drunk I couldn&rsquo;t consent and it was <em>rape</em>, and scolding me if I ever failed to call it <em>rape</em>, so I did used to call it that, but it always felt uncomfortably <em>off</em>. I ended up clinging to it anyway, because what else was I going to call it? It was either that or nothing, and I was <em>really</em> sure that what happened wasn&rsquo;t nothing. My &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; actually became a close friend – not a <em>good</em> friend, but a close one – but the events of that night were always a sticking point between us. Interestingly, given the topic, he did actually accept the label &ldquo;rapist&rdquo;, but he also treated it as a bit of joke. I guess he was defensive; I don&rsquo;t think he ever truly accepted he&rsquo;d done anything I hadn&rsquo;t wanted that night. I was defensive, too, because I knew that he had. For all that the word &ldquo;rape&rdquo; sat uneasily with me, I used it because consensual sex isn&rsquo;t what it felt like either. I clung to it because it felt like anything else would&rsquo;ve been letting him off the hook. If there had been a better word, one that correctly assigned the blame to him for <em>hurting</em> me without trying to imply consent is always a black and white yes–no binary, then sure, I&rsquo;d have preferred to use that. But that word doesn&rsquo;t exist. Probably it should.</p>
<p>What I really wanted was for him to change. As his friend, I saw all his good qualities too. I was sure he was capable of doing better, being better, than he had been with me (&hellip;and a bunch of other girls about the same age, in different ways, but that&rsquo;s by-the-by). He was a <em>feminist</em>, he claimed; <em>surely</em> he could come to understand the complicated interplay between power dynamics and sex! And so&hellip; I really appreciated Manning Walker&rsquo;s insistence on the same thing, that men can and must learn to be better, rather than &ldquo;rapist&rdquo; becoming a lifelong label that someone can never, ever grow free from. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve so rarely heard articulated but it strikes me as obviously true. I haven&rsquo;t spoken to my ex-friend in more than a decade now but I really hope he did, eventually, learn.</p>
<p>One last thing I&rsquo;ll say about this film is that it also depicts that really obnoxious kind of &ldquo;British people getting shitfaced at resorts in southern Europe&rdquo; subculture, which is definitely not my thing. In fact, before I realised what the movie was really about, I&rsquo;d thought I was going to have to tease Viv for taking me to a movie about the three most annoying English girls in film history. Basically they arrive in Greece with two goals: to get wasted and to get laid&hellip; and with the life experience I&rsquo;ve had, I find it truly gobsmacking that <em>anyone</em> would still think these are two things that can be combined.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out the position the film took on this. You might think, given the subject matter, that it came down firmly against it, but I didn&rsquo;t feel it did. I felt it kind of implied that it <em>is</em> possible to have sex (in a healthy, non-abusive way) when you&rsquo;re shitfaced, it&rsquo;s just Paddy didn&rsquo;t do that, and&hellip; that&rsquo;s not a message I&rsquo;m comfortable with. Of course, given my experiences, I gave a lot of thought back in the day to what it is that <em>makes</em> drunk sex (potentially) abusive, and the thing I kept coming back to is power. Two adults who respect each other as equals, and feel comfortable around each other&hellip; it&rsquo;s unlikely to be abusive in that case. But when you have a power imbalance – like when one of the parties is a young, frightened, virgin – it becomes very problematic, very quickly. So&hellip; I was very uncomfortable with the atmosphere of the resort in the film, which is full of <em>very</em> young adults who seem to have the expectation that they <em>can</em> get fucked up and <em>also</em> have sex with almost total strangers&hellip; like, of course this is going to end badly, what the hell! I just think there needs to be a complete division in people&rsquo;s minds, where &ldquo;partying/clubbing&rdquo; and &ldquo;hooking up&rdquo; are completely unrelated activities. Honestly, there&rsquo;s basically a zero percent chance that a drunken hookup with a guy you barely know is going to feel any good, anyway. I&rsquo;ll admit it&rsquo;s easy for me to say now, as an adult very far removed from that eighteen-year-old girl embarrassed about her ongoing virginity and insecure about whether anyone would ever find her attractive (as Tara, in the film, also is, despite her brash exterior). Even so&hellip; caving in to the advances of a pushy drunk guy who doesn&rsquo;t really care about you at all is not the way. Which is not to try to victim-blame&hellip; the pushy guys are still, ultimately, the ones with the responsibility. I just don&rsquo;t think girls, either, should have this expectation of getting laid on a holiday where they plan to be drunk 24/7. It&rsquo;s not worth the risk, man! Save the hookups for when you&rsquo;re sober.</p>

## US Muslims to Begin Ramadan Observance as War Rages in Gaza

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Islamic month of Ramadan is being observed this year as the Israel-Hamas war surges in Gaza, where the United Nations is warning of a growing humanitarian crisis.


Imam Talib Shareef of Masjid Muhammad, the Nation’s Mosque, in Washington said there will be differences in how Muslims observe this year because of the conflict.


Other than organizing prayers for the community, the mosque is "more engaged in service and feeding; we actually feed at the masjid and [also at] shelters, and we also go to other faith communities," said Shareef, who served for more than 30 years in the U.S. Air Force and helped to establish the first Islamic military chaplain in 1993.




"I do expect that … religious communities are going to be trying to come together," he said, noting that his mosque also works with churches and gives food to others in the community.


"Obviously [the conflict] is going to be on people's hearts, on people's souls, it's bothering people," Shareef said.


Nearly 2 billion Muslims around the world will begin observing the Islamic month of Ramadan, which is expected to begin on March 10 or 11, depending on the sighting of the moon.


During the month of Ramadan, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking, gossip and sexual relations from sunrise to sunset. Fasting is meant to bring Muslims closer to God and help them better empathize with those who are less fortunate.


US Muslims


In the United States, the Muslim population is about 3.45 million, which accounts for slightly more than 1% of the population, according to Pew Research.


Depending on where Muslims live in the United States, their experience can vary. In some rural areas, Muslims may not have access to a mosque or a community where they can practice their faith.


This is particularly true for immigrants who move to areas without a large Muslim population.




Jemal Yasin, who immigrated to the U.S. from Ethiopia in 2008 to do postgraduate research at the University of Vermont, described his first experience in the United States as "a little bit lonely."


He said there was a community of Somali immigrants, though he didn’t get a chance to pray with them.


During that first year in the States, he said he had to "pray in my room by myself," which he said was a typical experience of many Muslim immigrants.


Now, Yasin is president of the board of directors of a the First Hijrah Foundation in Washington.


The FHF started as a small organization that aimed to "promote and preserve the Islamic heritage," and "foster the Islamic principles of brotherhood, equality, mutual assistance and teachings of peace, love and justice," according to its website.


Initially, the organization didn't have a building, and members of the foundation would meet at one another's houses. It wasn't until 2005 that their current building was officially secured, said Yasin.


"This is a center for Muslims, all Muslims. … So, when you come here, you see [people of many] backgrounds – African Americans, Ethiopians, Somalians, Arabs – they will come pray together and break fast together, so this is a place for everybody," Yasin said.


He added that the foundation works with the community and organizes events for Muslims, before, during and after Ramadan.


When he moved to Washington later in 2008 Yasin became involved with the foundation and was able to be part of a larger Muslim community.


Ramadan observations are becoming more common in the United States, with many organizations hosting events to observe the month.


Shareef said, "We used to have more … private iftars in the past, and now they're more open … and we are able to share more."


After sunset, Muslims typically gather for iftar — the breaking of the fast and the most important meal of the day.


Yasin said the foundation helped organize a bazaar on Sunday to help the community prepare for Ramadan. Traditional clothing, incense and foods, such as dates, were sold.


During Ramadan, the First Hijrah Foundation will be providing free iftars for the community each night.


Ramadan this year


The ongoing Israel-Hamas war is the result of an October 7 terror attack in which Hamas crossed into Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking more than 240 civilians hostage. The Israeli military response has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry.


Negotiators are pushing for a possible cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas conflict ahead of the start of Ramadan.

## US Indictment Details Russian Oligarch’s Sanctions-Busting Scheme

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

washington — On Facebook, Vadim Wolfson makes his political position clear. His profile picture shows him in a baseball cap emblazoned with the words “Puck Futin,” while his banner image features a Russian anti-war flag.


In words and memes, Wolfson criticizes Russian President Vladimir Putin, top Russian officials and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.


But Wolfson — who formerly went by the last name Belyaev and founded the Otkritie financial group, once Russia’s largest private bank — is now accused of crimes that would appear to contradict these political views.


U.S. federal prosecutors say that in 2018 and 2019, the Austin, Texas, resident helped Andrei Kostin, an oligarch and head of Russia’s state VTB Bank, to own and manage an elite mansion in Colorado. That would have violated U.S. sanctions against the banker.


Wolfson was detained in Austin on February 22 but was soon released on his own recognizance. He is charged with violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which forms the foundation of the sanctions regime, and with conspiracy to violate it. Each charge could carry up to 20 years in prison.




Kostin is charged with sanctions violations, conspiracy to violate sanctions and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Each count is also punishable by up to 20 years behind bars. He remains at large, likely in Russia.


The charges, announced in a U.S. Justice Department press release last month, shed light on the alleged holdings of Kostin, whose bank is sometimes called "Putin's piggy bank,” and his alleged efforts to evade sanctions.




Kostin has called these accusations “baseless.”


“I have never violated any legislation, including American legislation, I have never circumvented any sanctions, and I urge all my partners not to look for or invent any ways to circumvent them, but to build a different world, independent of the pressure of the political elite and the U.S. military lobby,” he said in a comment published by Russia’s state Tass news agency.


In a message, Wolfson declined to comment on the lawsuit or answer questions from VOA. Regarding his political views, he said the following: “Since you read my FB, draw your own conclusions.”


Home in the Rocky Mountains


According to the indictment, Kostin purchased a luxury home in Aspen, Colorado, for $13.5 million in 2010. The formal owner of the house was the Colorado company 40 North Star LLC, and Kostin controlled it through a series of offshore companies, prosecutors say.


Two years later, he purchased three artworks for the house for $1 million. According to the indictment, they are the paintings "Combing the Ridges" by William Robinson Leigh and "Long in the Saddle" and "Arapaho Attack" by Wilhelm Heinrich Detlev Koerner. Both artists are famous for depicting the people and landscapes of the American West.


Prosecutors say that from 2010 to 2017, Kostin and his family spent around two weeks at the Aspen home every year, usually during the winter holidays.


Wolfson and his family also spent time there.


Using the parcel map for Pitkin County, where Aspen is located, Voice of America was able to identify the mansion.




It is located to the southeast of downtown Aspen. According to real estate website Zillow, the 1,027-square-meter (11,054-square-foot) home includes seven bedrooms and 10 bathrooms and features a swimming pool, sauna, whirlpool spa, home cinema and billiard room.


Today, the house rents for $600,000 per month, according to Zillow. It is currently owned by a company that appears to have no connection to Kostin or Wolfson.




Voice of America also found an image of the painting “Combing the Ridges” by Leigh.




The situation became complicated in 2014, after Russia illegally annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea. The United States and European countries began imposing sanctions on Russia and prominent Russian politicians and businesspeople.


Soon, the Aspen mansion’s ownership structure changed.


According to prosecutors, in 2014, Altamonte Holding Limited, a company recently registered in the British Virgin Islands, purchased 40 North Star LLC for $10 million.


A database of offshore leaks maintained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists indicates that the beneficial owner of a BVI company with a nearly identical name — Altamonte Holdings Limited — is Vadim Belyaev (aka Wolfson).


A company ultimately owned by Kostin, Capital Business Finance, provided financing for the purchase, the indictment states.


In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Kostin. The following year, Wolfson bought 40 North Star for $12 million through two financial transactions with a subsidiary of Capital Business Finance controlled by Kostin. The deal violated the sanctions, prosecutors state in the indictment.


In 2018-20, it was Wolfson who primarily used the Aspen home. According to the parcel register, in 2020 the home was sold to another company for $12.5 million. The current owner appears not to be connected to Kostin or Wolfson.

Out at sea


The indictment does not end with real estate and art. Prosecutors also contend Kostin controlled two yachts through offshore companies: Sea Rhapsody and Sea & Us.


According to the document, Kostin mainly used the former yacht with his wife and family, while he primarily spent time on the latter with his mistress.


That latter yacht appeared in a 2019 investigation by the late Russian opposition activist Alexey Navalny, which dealt with the relationship between Kostin and Nailya Asker-zade, a presenter on the state TV channel Rossiya.




Prosecutors say Kostin bought the 66-meter (217-foot) Sea Rhapsody for $65 million between 2008 and 2012. It was built according to his order. It features six luxury cabins, an infinity pool, a whirlpool spa and a cinema.


Sea & Us is 62 meters (203 feet) long and was custom built for the banker in 2016-18. He paid at least $70 million for it.


According to prosecutors, in 2018-22, Kostin and unnamed accomplices carried out a scheme to provide financing, goods and services to operate, maintain and improve the yachts.


The indictment states they engaged in money laundering by transporting monetary instruments and funds in and out of the United States but does not provide further details of these activities.


According to maritime analytics site marinetraffic.com, Sea Rhapsody is now moored in Victoria, the capital of the Seychelles.


Sea & Us was renamed Serenity and Unity. According to the tracker, it is currently off the coast of Turkey.


Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of property and funds that they say Kostin, Wolfson and others obtained by committing the crimes listed in the indictment.

## The future that never was

date: 2024-03-07, from: OS News

Just before the end of 1989, Microsoft made available the first pre-release version of the long promised 32-bit OS/2 2.0, which was intended to be the first mass-market 32-bit PC operating system. This was accompanied by a press release detailing the $2,600 OS/2 2.0 Software Development Kit (SDK). Unfortunately, the December 1989 pre-release of OS/2 2.0 may not have survived to the present day. But in June 1990, Microsoft shipped the second pre-release of the OS/2 2.0 SDK. And that version has now turned up, after twenty years of searching, and nearly a quarter century after its release! ↫ Michal Necasek at OS/2 Museum OS/2 is one of the biggest what-ifs in tech, and the whole origin story and demise of the platform is worthy of a big budget drama series. It also happens to be one of my favourite retrocomputing platforms of all time, so I may be biased.

## US House Passes $460 Billion Package of Spending Bills to Avert Deadline

date: 2024-03-07, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The House passed a $460 billion package of spending bills Wednesday that would keep money flowing to key federal agencies through the remainder of the budget year. The Senate is expected to take up the legislation before a midnight Friday shutdown deadline. 


Lawmakers are negotiating a second package of six bills, including defense, in an effort to have all federal agencies fully funded before a March 22 deadline. In the end, total discretionary spending set by Congress is expected to come in at about $1.66 trillion for the full year. 


A significant number of House Republicans have lined up in opposition to the spending packages, forcing House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, to use an expedited process to bring the bill up for a vote. That process requires two-thirds of the House to vote for the measure for it to pass. 


The House passed the measure by a vote of 339-85. 


The nondefense spending in this year's bills is relatively flat compared with the previous year. Supporters say that keeping that spending below the rate of inflation is tantamount to a cut, forcing agencies to be more frugal and focus manpower on top priorities. Johnson cited a 10% cut to the Environmental Protection Agency, a 7% cut to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and a 6% cut to the FBI. 




But many Republican lawmakers were seeking much steeper cuts and more policy victories. The House Freedom Caucus, which contains dozens of the GOP's most conservative members, urged Republicans to vote against the first spending package and oppose the second one being negotiated. 


"Despite giving Democrats higher spending levels, the omnibus text released so far punts on nearly every single Republican policy priority," the group said. 


Johnson countered that House Republicans have just a two-vote majority in the House while Democrats control the Senate and White House. 


"We have to be realistic about what we're able to achieve," Johnson said. 


Democrats staved off most of the riders that House Republicans sought to include in the package. For example, they beat back an effort to block new rules that expand access to the abortion pill mifepristone. 


Democrats also said the bill would fully fund a nutrition program for low-income women, infants and children, providing about $7 billion for what is known as the WIC program. That's a $1 billion increase from the previous year. 


"The bill certainly doesn't have everything that we may have wanted, but I am very proud to say we successfully defeated the vast majority of the extreme cuts and hundreds of harmful policy riders proposed by the House Republicans," said lawmaker Rosa DeLauro, the top-ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. 




House Republicans were able to achieve some policy wins, however. One provision, for example, will prevent the sale of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China. Another policy mandate prohibits the Justice Department from investigating parents who exercise free speech at local school board meetings. 


Another provision strengthens gun rights for certain veterans. 


Under current law, the Department of Veterans Affairs must send a beneficiary's name to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever a fiduciary is appointed to help manage someone's benefits because they lack the mental capacity to manage their own affairs. This year's spending package prohibits the department from transmitting that information unless a relevant judicial authority rules that the beneficiary is a danger to himself or herself, or others. 


The bills to fund federal agencies are more than five months past due, with the budget year beginning October 1. House Republicans are describing an improved process nevertheless, saying they have broken the cycle of passing all the spending bills in one massive package that lawmakers have little time to study before being asked to vote on it or risk a government shutdown.

## Google’s changes to comply with the DMA

date: 2024-03-07, from: OS News

The European Union&#8217;s Digital Markets Act (DMA) comes into force this week for companies who have been designated. Today, we are sharing some more details about the changes we are making to comply, following product testing we announced earlier this year. ↫ Oliver Bethell on the official Google blog This is Google&#8217;s overview of the changes it&#8217;s implementing to comply with the DMA, some of which the company already announced months ago. Google&#8217;s changes don&#8217;t have as much of a direct, noticeable impact as some other company&#8217;s changes, mostly since a lot of the more impactful consequences of the DMA, such as allowing sideloading and alternative application stores, were already allowed on Android. Other changes, like to Search, will take longer to be noticed. The one thing that stands out is the tone &#8211; compared to Apple&#8217;s communication around the DMA. Whereas Apple sounds like a petulant whiny toddler, Google sounds constructive, to the point, and, well, like an adult. That doesn&#8217;t mean Google&#8217;s post isn&#8217;t also full of shit in places, but at least they&#8217;re being grown-ups about it.
