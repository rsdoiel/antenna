id="if-your-immutable-linux-desktop-uses-flatpak-im-going-to-have-a-bad-time">If
your immutable Linux desktop uses Flatpak, I’m going to have a bad
time</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-29, from: OS News</p>
<p>The openSUSE project recently announced the second release candidate
(RC2) of its Aeon Desktop, formerly known as MicroOS Desktop GNOME.
Aside from the new coat of naming paint, Aeon breaks ground in a few
other ways by dabbling with technologies not found in other openSUSE
releases. The goal for Aeon is to provide automated system updates using
snapshots that can be applied atomically, removing the burden of system
maintenance for “lazy developers” who want to focus on their work rather
than desktop administration. System-tinkerers need not apply. The idea
behind Aeon, as with other immutable (or image-based) Linux
distributions, is to provide the core of the distribution as a read-only
image or filesystem that is updated atomically and can be rolled back if
needed. Google’s ChromeOS was the first popular Linux-based desktop
operating system to follow this model. Since the release of ChromeOS a
number of interesting immutable implementations have cropped up, such as
Fedora Silverblue, Project Bluefin (covered here in December 2023),
openSUSE’s MicroOS (covered here in March 2023), and Ubuntu Core. ↫ Joe
Brockmeier at LWN With the amount of attention immutable Linux desktops
are getting, and how much work and experimentation that’s going into
them, I’m getting the feeling that sooner or later all of the major,
popular desktop Linux distributions will be going this route. Depending
on implementation details, I actually like the concept of a defined base
system that’s just an image that can be replaced easily using btrfs
snapshots or something like that, while all the user’s files and
customisations are kept elsewhere. It makes intuitive sense. Where the
current crop of immutable Linux desktops fall flat for me is their
reliance on (usually) Flatpak. You know how there’s people who hate
systemd and/or Wayland just a little too much, to the point it gets a
little weird and worrying? That’s me whenever I have to deal with
Flatpaks. Every experience I have with Flatpaks is riddled with trouble
for me. Even though I’m a KDE user, I’m currently testing out the latest
GNOME release on my workstation (the one that I used to conclude Windows
is simply not ready for the desktop), using Fedora of course, and on
GNOME I use the Mastodon application Tuba. While I mostly write in
English, I do occasionally write in Dutch, too, and would love for the
spell check feature to work in my native tongue, too, instead of just in
English. However, despite having all possible Dutch dictionaries
installed – hunspell, aspell – and despite those dictionaries being
picked up everywhere else in GNOME, Tuba only showed me a long list of
variants of English. After digging around to find out why this was
happening, it took me far longer than I care to publicly admit to
realise that since the latest version of Tuba is only really available
as a Flatpak on Fedora, my problem probably had something to do with
that – and it turns out I was right: Flatpak applications do not use the
system-wide installed spellcheck dictionaries like normal applications
do. This eventually led me to this article by Daniel Aleksandersen,
where he details what you need to do in order to add spellcheck
dictionaries to Flatpak applications. You need to run the following
commands: The list of languages uses two-letter codes only, and the
first language listed will serve as the display language for Flatpak
applications, while the rest will be fallback languages – which happens
to include downloading and installing the Flatpak-specific copies of the
spellcheck libraries. Sadly, this method is not particularly granular.
Since it only accepts the two-letter codes, you can’t, say, only install
“nl-nl”; you’ll be getting “nl-be” as well. In the case of a widely
spoken language like English, this means a massive list of 18 different
varieties of English. The resulting menus are… Not elegant. This is just
an example, but using Flatpak, you’ll run into all kinds of issues like
this, that then have to be solved by hacks or obscure terminal commands
– not exactly the user-friendly image Flatpak is trying to convey to the
world. This particular issue might not matter to the probably
overwhelming English-speaking majority of Flatpak developers, but for
anyone who has to deal with multiple languages on a daily basis – which
is a massive number of people, probably well over 50% of computer users
– having to mess around with obscure terminal commands hidden in blog
posts just to be able to use the languages they use every day is
terrible design on a multitude of levels, and will outright make Flatpak
applications unusable for large numbers of people. Whenever I run into
these Flatpak problems, it makes it clear to me that Flatpak is designed
not by users, for users – but by developers, for developers. I can
totally understand and see why Flatpak is appealing to developers, but
as a user, they bring me nothing but grief, issues, and weird bugs that
all seem to stem from being made to make developers’ lives easier,
instead of users’. If immutable Linux distributions are really hellbent
on using Flatpak as the the means of application installation – and it
seams like they are – it will mean a massive regression in
functionality, usability, and discoverability for users, and as long as
Flatpak remains as broken and badly designed as it is, I really see no
reason to recommend an immutable Linux desktop to anyone but the really
curious among us.</p>

<h2 id="biden-trump-debate-draws-48m-tv-viewers">Biden-Trump debate
draws 48M TV viewers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Roughly 48 million TV viewers tuned in to watch Thursday’s
U.S. presidential debate between Democratic President Joe Biden and
Republican rival Donald Trump, according to preliminary Nielsen
data.</p>
<p>The number suggests the final audience will be about one-third less
than the 73 million people who watched the candidates’ first face-off in
2020, and among the three lowest-rated first presidential debates since
1976.</p>
<p>The relatively low number compared with past debates in recent
election cycles could be indicative of low voter enthusiasm for both
candidates. It does not capture the full extent of online viewing, which
has grown in popularity as traditional TV audiences decline.</p>
<p>Media experts were looking to see how a new format by host CNN would
play out, and whether it would provide a template for future debates.
The restrictions of that format, which included the option for CNN to
mute the candidates’ microphones, imposed some discipline on the
candidates and should be emulated by other networks, three media experts
said.</p>
<p>CNN, which held the exclusive rights to present the debate, allowed
candidates two minutes for each answer and one minute for rebuttals, and
muted their microphones if they exceeded those limits. The studio did
not have an audience, and moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper did not
fact-check the candidates in real time.</p>
<p>CNN defended itself against the criticism from some media
commentators that the absence of real-time fact-checking allowed both
candidates to spread false claims.</p>
<p>“The role of the moderators is to present the candidates with
questions that are important to American voters and to facilitate a
debate, enabling candidates to make their case and challenge their
opponent,” a CNN spokesperson said in a statement.</p>

<p>When someone tells you who they are, believe them. Microsoft’s AI
chief Mustafa Suleyman: With respect to content that is already on the
open web, the social contract of that content since the ’90s has been
that it is fair use. Anyone can copy it, recreate with it, reproduce
with it. That has been freeware, if you like. That’s been the
understanding. ↫ Mustafa Suleyman This is absolute bullshit from the
first word to the very last. None of this is true – not even in the
slightest. Content on the web is not free for the taking by anyone,
especially not to be chewed up and regurgitated verbatim by spicy
autocomplete tools. There is no “social contract” to that effect. In
fact, when I go to any of Microsoft’s website, documents, videos, or any
other content they publish online, on the open web, and scroll to the
very bottom of the page, it’s all got the little copyright symbol or
similar messaging. Once again, this underlines how entitled Silicon
Valley techbros really are. If we violate even a gram of Microsoft’s
copyrights, we’d have their lawyers on our ass in weeks – but when
Microsoft itself needs to violate copyright and licensing on an
automated, industrial scale, for massive profits, everything is suddenly
peace, love, and fair use. Men in Silicon Valley just do not understand
consent. At all. And they show this time and time again. Meanwhile, the
Internet Archive has to deal with crap like this: The lawsuit is about
the longstanding and widespread library practice of controlled digital
lending, which is how we lend the books we own to our patrons. As a
result of the publishers’ lawsuit, more than 500,000 books have been
removed from our lending library. ↫ Chris Freeland at the Internet
Archive Blogs Controlled lending without a profit motive is deemed
illegal, but violating copyright and licensing on an automated,
industrial scale is fair use. Make it make sense. Make it make
sense.</p>

graphics: more than you wanted to know</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Apple ][ is one of the most iconic vintage computers of all time.
But since Wozniak’s monster lasted all the way until 1993 (1995 if you
could the IIe card, which I won’t count until I get one), it can be easy
to forget that in 1977, it was a video extravaganza. The competitors–
even much bigger and established companies like Commodore and Tandy–
generally only had text modes, let alone pixel-addressable graphics, and
they certainly didn’t have sixteen colors. (Gray and grey are different
colors, right?) ↫ Nicole Branagan If there’s ever anything you wanted to
know about how graphics work on the Apple II, this is the place to go.
It’s an incredibly detailed and illustrated explanation of how the
machine renders and displays graphics, and an excellent piece of writing
to boot. I’m a little jealous.</p>

<h2 id="us-allies-warn-of-north-korea-russia-military-cooperation">US,
allies warn of North Korea-Russia military cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — The United States and its allies warned Friday that
expanding military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is
dangerous, illegal and a growing threat to the wider international
community.</p>
<p>“Last week, Russian and DPRK leaders signed a ‘Treaty on
Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,’ paving the way for further
deepening their military cooperation,” Robert Wood, U.S. deputy U.N.
ambassador, told reporters, surrounded by representatives of nearly 50
like-minded countries.</p>
<p>“We are deeply concerned about the security implications of the
advancement of this cooperation for Europe, the Korean Peninsula, the
Indo-Pacific region and around the world.”</p>
<p>DPRK is the abbreviation for North Korea’s official name, the
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Wood spoke ahead of a meeting of the U.N. Security Council requested
by the United States, Britain, France, Japan and South Korea to discuss
North Korea’s transfer of arms and munitions to Russia, which are
helping drive the Kremlin’s war machine in Ukraine. Such transfers would
violate a U.N. arms embargo on North Korea.</p>
<p>“Before February 2022, it was hard to imagine that the war in Ukraine
would pose such a direct threat to the security of the Korean
Peninsula,” South Korean Ambassador Joonkook Hwang told council members.
“But now we are facing a new reality.”</p>
<p>He said South Korea’s national defense ministry has assessed that
since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir
Putin held a summit in Russia in September, Pyongyang has shipped at
least 10,000 containers to Russia that can hold a total of as many as 5
million artillery shells. His government has also determined that
122-millimeter artillery shells made in North Korea were included in the
weapons Russia has used against Ukraine.</p>
<p>In return for the weapons, North Korea is seeking trade and military
assistance from Russia, which would violate U.N. sanctions. It is also
benefiting from Russia’s political protection in the Security
Council.</p>
<p>“All these developments can bring about a shift in the global
security landscape, and the potential long-term effects are dangerously
uncertain,” Hwang said, adding that Seoul would “resolutely respond” to
any threats to its security in a “prudent and measured” way.</p>
<p>U.N. sanctions experts detailed prohibited transfers of military
equipment and munitions from North Korea to Russia in a report in
February — which Moscow denied. Russia then used its Security Council
veto to shut down the 14-year-old monitoring panel in April.</p>
<p>Russia’s envoy again dismissed accusations it is getting weapons from
North Korea at Friday’s meeting.</p>
<p>“This is completely false,” Vassily Nebenzia told the council, adding
that the two countries’ cooperation “is exclusively constructive and
legitimate in nature.”</p>
<p>Nebenzia dismissed the panel of experts’ findings as controlled and
directed by the West.</p>
<p>“The panel of experts have been following those orders given them and
turning in the direction they were told to turn,” he said.</p>
<p>North Korea’s envoy defended Pyongyang and Moscow’s treaty, saying
relations between the two countries “are completely peace-loving and
defensive in nature.”</p>
<p>“Therefore, there is no reason whatsoever to be concerned about
development of their bilateral relations, unless they have intention to
undertake a military invasion of the DPRK and Russian Federation,”
Ambassador Song Kim said.</p>
<p>China, which has traditionally been North Korea’s closest ally,
expressed concern about heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>“China calls on parties concerned to be rational and pragmatic and to
find joint efforts to find a solution,” Deputy Ambassador Geng Shuang
said.</p>
<p>Washington’s envoy urged Beijing to use its influence with both
Pyongyang and Moscow to persuade them to cease their “increasingly
dangerous cooperation.”</p>
<p>“So I appeal to my Chinese colleague to understand that if indeed the
situation on the Korean Peninsula continues on the trajectory it’s
going, the United States and its allies will have to take steps to
defend their security,” Wood said.</p>

<h2 id="worlds-largest-naval-exercise-sends-message-to-china">World’s
largest naval exercise sends message to China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pentagon — The United States and 28 partner nations have begun the
world’s largest naval war exercise off the shores of Hawaii, known as
the Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC. </p>
<p>This year’s exercise brings international cooperation on a scale like
no other: 40 surface ships, more than 150 aircraft, three submarines and
25,000 people.</p>
<p>Nations from around the globe are practicing a wide range of
missions, from natural disaster response to attack skills needed for
war. While most participants are nations with Pacific coastlines, this
year’s RIMPAC also includes non-Pacific nations, including the United
Kingdom, France, Brazil and Israel.</p>
<p>“Every nation in the world that has interests in the Pacific and will
adhere to the same values is more than welcome to participate,”
said Chilean Navy Commodore Alberto Guerrero, RIMPAC deputy
commander.</p>
<p>One country not invited? China.</p>
<p>Why? Because the warm welcome RIMPAC gave to China in 2014 and 2016
backfired, according to Markus Garlauskas, director of the Indo-Pacific
Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council.</p>
<p>“There was this outreach to China, and definitely the U.S. and its
allies and partners were essentially burned by the Chinese taking
advantage of it … as an opportunity to essentially collect intelligence
and to try and get more acceptance of what should be considered
unacceptable behavior,” Garlauskas told VOA.</p>
<p>Since China’s last RIMPAC in 2016, he said, Beijing ramped up its
aggressive behavior, building and militarizing more artificial islands
in international waters, conducting aggressive maneuvers around Taiwan
in recent months and pummeling Philippine ships with water cannons in
recent days.</p>
<p>But the biennial exercise, officials say, can send a strong message
to China to stop bullying its neighbors. RIMPAC nations this year will
practice targeting the decommissioned assault ship USS Tarawa, in a rare
chance to learn how effective their weapons are at sinking a large and
protected adversary in open waters. </p>
<p>“They’re not just going to be facing the United States in the country
they’re targeting, but they’re potentially going to have to deal with a
response from a wide range of countries that have common interests in
deterring and confronting Chinese aggression as threats to a free and
open Indo-Pacific,” Garlauskas said.</p>
<p>Israel’s inclusion this year sparked calls from pro-Palestinian
activists wanting countries to skip the exercise in protest. Malaysia’s
prime minister addressed the protesters ahead of the exercises, saying
that while his country would continue to speak out in support of the
Palestinian people, Malaysia needed to act in a way that was “not driven
by anger,” while also considering the practical implications of missing
the major military exercise.</p>
<p>RIMPAC is set to end in early August.</p>

not unusual to port the Linux Vector Packet Processor (VPP) to
FreeBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Vector Packet Processor (VPP) is a framework for moving packets
around at high rates. Its core concept is handling packets in groups
known as “vectors,” which allows for the native use of vector processor
instructions for packet classification and processing in different CPU
architectures — currently amd64 and arm64. VPP can process packets at
incredibly high rates and competes with many dedicated forwarding
appliances. This is achieved using userspace networking that bypasses
the host’s normal network stack. This article describes the porting of
VPP to FreeBSD and working with the upstream VPP project to include
FreeBSD as a supported target. ↫ Tom Jones It’s not unusual for me to

<h2 id="what-happens-after-chevron">What Happens After Chevron?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxNjczNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODY5MjA3OH0.vuyCBLSJbd_ee3X8Ot8T3q0giZ73SgCWoDq7OaqgqPQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s a sad day for the regulatory state. On Friday, the Supreme Court
struck down a 40-year-old precedent that deferred to agencies’
interpretations of their own mandates where the statutory guidance was
incomplete or ambiguous, otherwise known as <em><em>Chevron</em></em>
deference, after the losing side in the original case. Not only has it
been cited in
<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/loper-bright-and-relentless-ending-judicial-deference-to-cement-judicial-activism-in-the-courts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more
than 19,000</u></a> federal opinions, it’s the one congressional aides —
the ones actually writing the laws — are most familiar with, as Lisa
Heinzerling, a professor of environmental law at Georgetown Law, told
me.
</p>
<p>
“So there’s a way in which Congress has been relying on
<em><em>Chevron</em></em> for decades, right?” she said. “If Congress
banked on <em><em>Chevron</em></em>, banked on the idea that if they
didn’t make things clear the agency would take care of it, then that
reliance is not being honored.”
</p>
<p>
This is not the first time the court has come for regulators. Two years
ago, in <em><em>West Virginia v. Environmental Protection
Agency</em></em>, the court held that the authority to resolve questions
of interpretation involving high-stakes political and economic
questions, a.k.a. “major questions,” rests with Congress, not the
agencies, raising the threat of legal nightmares should regulators
attempt to take any kind of big swings. This explicitly concerns only
“extraordinary cases,” and yet regulators already appear to be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/epa-rules-biden" target="_self"><u>reining
in</u></a> their own ambition to gird against potential challenges.
</p>
<p>
Friday’s decision comes the day after the court
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-859new_kjfm.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>struck
down</u></a> a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act giving certain
enforcement powers to the Securities and Exchange Commission and granted
a stay on enforcement of the Environmental Protection Agency’s “good
neighbor” rule, aimed at preventing harmful pollution from crossing
state lines.
</p>
<p>
The two cases decided this week — <em><em>Loper Bright Enterprises et
al. v. Raimondo</em></em>, <em>Secretary of Commerce, et al.</em> and
<em><em>Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce</em></em> — turned on
whether private commercial fishing companies could be compelled to pay
for federal monitors to ride along and ensure they were complying with
applicable fishing rules. Or at least they did initially. “The court
decided to decide <em><em>only</em></em> the question whether to
overrule <em><em>Chevron</em></em>, the case that establishes deference
for agencies legal interpretations,” Heinzerling explained the day
before the ruling came down. Our conversation has been edited for length
and clarity.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Without
</strong><em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong>, are we
going to get completely bogged down in revising statutes? Are our courts
going to be clogged up with nuisance suits from people who simply don’t
want to have to follow the rules?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I think there will be a lot of efforts to undo other precedent that
relied on <em><em>Chevron</em></em> — and especially paired with the
<a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2023/22-1008" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Corner
Post</em></em></u><u> case</u></a>, which has to do with the timing of
challenges to agency action. You know, realistically, if that case comes
down, accepting a longer period of time in which to sue people could go
nuts, challenging all sorts of agency interpretations from the past. So
that’s disruptive.
</p>
<p>
The Supreme Court is constantly saying, well, go and get a new statute.
Well, okay, we saw what happens when Congress passes a new statute: The
court holds it unconstitutional. The Dodd-Frank Act. Look what happened
to the Affordable Care Act. These major pieces of legislation, major,
major political stakes, and the court has not respected those. So I feel
like we’re kind of in a shell game, something that’s not quite honest.
That in all of these cases, actually, Congress did pass a law, but the
court either rules it unconstitutional, says it’s not clear enough. And
so I don’t think they’re respecting Congress’s handiwork as it exists
now.
</p>
<p>
<strong>You mentioned </strong><em><strong><em>Corner
Post</em></strong></em><strong>, could you talk about that
case?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It came to the court kind of quietly. It’s got
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/truck-stop-sleeper-case-could-open-old-rules-to-new-lawsuits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rich
backers</u></a>. It’s just a little truckstop, just like the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/climate/koch-chevron-deference-supreme-court.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>commercial
fisherman</u></a>, that wants to challenge a rule on credit cards. They
were incorporated after the rule went into effect, and they want to say,
we weren’t injured when it first passed, so we should get the benefit of
a longer period of time in which to sue. And amazingly, the justices
seemed willing to accept that. That just adds to the stakes of
overruling <em><em>Chevron</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The </strong><em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong>
deference is a big part of how agencies do their job. But after West
Virginia, does it still matter? I’m not a lawyer, but I’m going to
pretend I am one when I ask: Does the major questions doctrine
effectively invalidate </strong><em><strong><em>Chevron
anyway</em></strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</p>
<p>
No. They said that the major questions idea was for extraordinary cases,
to see how it turns out over the years, but it’s not every case. Where
<em><em>Chevron</em></em> applied, theoretically, in every case. At
least it was a mix.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What recent regulatory decisions would be most vulnerable in a
post-</strong><em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong>
world?</strong>
</p>
<p>
It is complicated to know because it has to be a question about a
statute, a question about a statute that a court finds ambiguous, right?
That’s where <em><em>Chevron</em></em> would have helped. And I think it
depends on what court you’re in. If you’re in the Fifth Circuit, there’s
a good chance — I mean, they’ve just stopped using
<em><em>Chevron</em></em>, period.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Is there a world in which courts develop more subject matter
expertise as a result of being forced to decide on questions of
statutory interpretation?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Over the years people have offered the possibility of science courts or
environmental courts — specialized courts where adjudicators have
expertise. That’s never really taken off — never really at all taken
off. Certainly the D.C. Circuit judges handle administrative cases all
the time. Cases go exclusively to them, and I think the judges do
develop some expertise. But it doesn’t turn them into ecologists or
engineers. And the thing is that the structure of a judicial chambers is
both tiny and insular: you have one judge; on the Supreme Court four
clerks, but elsewhere two to three. It’s just not that much. Whereas
EPA, they have teams of people on these rules from all over the agency,
and then the rule gets reviewed by others.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We’re obviously focused on climate-related regulations, but is
there an area of policy that you think will be most vulnerable
immediately without
</strong><em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</p>
<p>
The hallmarks of where <em><em>Chevron</em></em> has been really
important: complicated statutes; technical and/or scientific subject
matter; places where the language is either vague or just broad enough,
it’s not clear how to fill it in. That’s environmental law, but there’s
a lot of other law that’s also … I mean, it’s just OSHA, FDA, the FTC.
Looking for those signature traits, that’s going to be a place where it
pinches particularly hard. I think the agencies now are sort of bracing
for this, but they still have a lot of rules in the works, and this is
going to come down in the middle of that <em><em>in election
year</em></em>.
</p>
<p>
<em><strong><em>Chevron</em></strong></em><strong> started with Reagan
wanting to change the way the EPA interpreted its mandate. Would
removing it potentially make things more difficult for an incoming Trump
administration?</strong>
</p>
<p>
I mean, it should. <em><em>Chevron</em></em> was supposed to work that
way. But certainly the major questions doctrine, at least as it’s been
practiced, so far cuts only against ambitious regulation. It doesn’t cut
in favor of it.
</p>
<p>
The thing that worries me is the anti-regulatory skew that’s in some of
the court’s other recent rulings. So for example, in <em><em>West
Virginia</em></em> itself, the Supreme Court struck down Obama’s Clean
Power Plan but upheld — without even explaining why — Trump’s plan. They
were the same question under the same statute with the same evidence,
the same costs and benefits. Everything was the same except for the
direction. If one was a major question, the other should have been a
major question. And so if you want to put it in the terms of these two
possible administrations, they will go after Biden rules more than
they’ll go after Trump rules, at least on the major questions idea.

<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will expand deportation relief
and work permits to an estimated 309,000 Haitians in the country
already, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Friday.  </p>
<p>The administration will expand access to the Temporary Protected
Status program to Haitians through February 2026 because of violence and
security issues in Haiti that limits access to safety, health care, food
and water, the department said. The expanded program will be available
to Haitians in the U.S. on or before June 3. </p>
<p>About 264,000 Haitians in the U.S. were already covered by the
program, according to the U.S. government.  </p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, a Democrat seeking another term in the
November 5 elections, has walked a political tightrope when it comes to
immigration, both trying to step up security at the U.S.-Mexico border
and take a more humane approach to immigrants in the U.S.
illegally. </p>
<p>In a presidential debate on Thursday, Biden’s Republican challenger,
former president Donald Trump, criticized Biden for failing to stem high
levels of illegal immigration. </p>
<p>Gang wars in Haiti have displaced over half a million people and

Supreme Court curbs federal agency powers, overturning 1984
precedent</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a major blow to federal
regulatory power on Friday by overturning a 1984 precedent that had
given deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they
administer, handing a defeat to President Joe Biden’s
administration.</p>
<p>The justices ruled 6-3 in favor of fishing companies that challenged
a government-run program partly funded by industry that monitored
overfishing of herring off New England’s coast.</p>
<p>It marked the latest decision in recent years powered by the Supreme
Court’s conservative majority that hemmed in the authority of federal
agencies.</p>
<p>The precedent that the court overturned arose from a ruling involving
oil company Chevron that had called for judges to defer to reasonable
federal agency interpretations of U.S. laws deemed to be ambiguous. This
doctrine, long opposed by conservatives and business interests, was
called “Chevron deference.”</p>
<p>The decreasing productivity of Congress – thanks to its gaping
partisan divide – has led to a growing reliance, especially by
Democratic presidents, on rules issued by U.S. agencies to realize
regulatory goals.</p>
<p>The 1984 precedent, set in a ruling involving oil company Chevron,
has called for judges to defer to federal agency interpretations of U.S.
laws that are deemed to be ambiguous.</p>
<p>This doctrine, long opposed by conservatives and business interests,
is called “Chevron deference.”</p>
<p>Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration had defended the
National Marine Fisheries Service regulation at issue and the Chevron
deference doctrine. The fish conservation program was started in 2020
under Republican former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The regulation called for certain commercial fishermen to carry
aboard their vessels U.S. government contractors and pay for their
at-sea services while they monitored the catch.  </p>
<p>The companies – led by New Jersey-based Loper Bright Enterprises and
Rhode Island-based Relentless Inc – in 2020 sued the fisheries service,
claiming the monitoring program exceeded the Commerce Department
agency’s authority.</p>
<p>The bid by the fishermen was supported by various conservative and
corporate interest groups including billionaire Charles Koch’s network.
The litigation is part of what has been termed the “war on the
administrative state,” an effort to weaken the federal agency
bureaucracy that interprets laws, crafts federal rules and implements
executive action.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, with its 6-3 conservative majority, has signaled
skepticism toward expansive regulatory power, issuing rulings in recent
years to rein in what its conservative justices have viewed as overreach
by the Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies.</p>
<p>The fish conservation program aimed to monitor 50 percent of declared
herring fishing trips in the regulated area, with program costs split
between the federal government and the fishing industry. The cost to
commercial fishermen of paying for the monitoring was an estimated $710
per day for 19 days a year, which could reduce a vessel’s income by up
to 20 percent, according to government figures.</p>
<p>The Biden administration said the program was authorized under a 1976
federal law called the Magnuson-Stevens Act to protect against
overfishing in U.S. coastal waters. It said in court papers the program
was suspended for the fishing year starting in April 2023 due to
insufficient federal funding.</p>
<p>The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit and the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
both ruled in favor of the government.</p>
<p>The Biden administration said Chevron deference among other things
“gives due weight to the expertise that agencies bring to bear” and
promotes national uniformity in the administration of federal law.</p>
<p>An attorney for the commercial fishermen said Chevron deference
“incentivizes a dynamic where Congress does far less than the Framers
[of the U.S. Constitution] anticipated, and the executive branch is left
to do far more by deciding controversial issues via regulatory
fiat.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has issued other rulings this term involving the
scope of agency powers, including two rulings on Thursday. It rejected
the Securities and Exchange Commission’s in-house enforcement of laws
protecting investors against securities fraud. It also blocked an
Environmental Protection Agency regulation aimed at reducing ozone
emissions that may worsen air pollution in neighboring states.</p>
<p>The justices on May 16 upheld the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau’s funding mechanism in a challenge brought by the payday loan
industry.</p>

Supreme Court backs anti-camping laws used against homeless people</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court upheld on Friday anti-camping
laws used by authorities in an Oregon city to stop homeless people from
sleeping in public parks and public streets — a ruling that gives local
and state governments a freer hand in confronting a national
homelessness crisis. </p>
<p>The justices ruled 6-3 to overturn a lower court’s decision that
found that enforcing the ordinances in the city of Grants Pass when no
shelter space is available for the homeless violates the U.S.
Constitution’s Eighth Amendment prohibition on “cruel and unusual”
punishments. Various jurisdictions employ similar laws. </p>
<p>The court’s conservative justices were in the majority, while its
three liberal members dissented. </p>
<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch, who authored the ruling, wrote, “Homelessness
is complex. Its causes are many. So may be the public policy responses
required to address it. At bottom, the question this case presents is
whether the Eighth Amendment grants federal judges primary
responsibility for assessing those causes and devising those responses.
It does not.” </p>
<p>Homelessness remains a multifaceted problem for public officials in
the United States as many municipalities experience chronic shortages of
affordable housing. On any given night, more than 600,000 people are
homeless, according to U.S. government estimates. </p>
<p>The case focused on three ordinances in Grants Pass, a city of
roughly 38,000 people in southwestern Oregon, that together prohibit
sleeping in public streets, alleyways and parks while using a blanket or
bedding. Violators are fined $295. Repeat offenders can be criminally
prosecuted for trespassing, punishable by up to 30 days in jail. </p>
<p>Advocates for the homeless, various liberal legal groups and other
critics have said laws like these criminalize people simply for being
homeless and for actions they cannot avoid, such as sleeping in public.
They point to a 1962 Supreme Court ruling that the Eighth Amendment
barred punishing individuals based on their status rather than their
conduct. </p>
<p>A point of contention during the Supreme Court’s arguments in the
case in April was whether homelessness can be deemed a status that would
prohibit enforcing local laws. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s administration agreed with the plaintiffs that
Grants Pass cannot enforce an “absolute ban” on sleeping in the city —
which effectively criminalizes homelessness — but suggested the rulings
by the lower courts against the city were too broad and should be
reconsidered. </p>
<p>Proponents including various government officials have called such
laws a necessary tool for maintaining public safety.  </p>
<p>The case, which began in 2018, involved three homeless people who
filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to block the measures impacting
them in Grants Pass. One of the plaintiffs has since died. </p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark Clarke ruled that the city’s “policy and
practice of punishing homelessness” violates the Eighth Amendment and
barred it from enforcing the anti-camping ordinances. The San
Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Clarke’s
injunction against the ordinances. </p>
<p>The city had defended itself in the case in part by noting that
homeless people have alternatives outside the city, including nearby
undeveloped federal land, county campsites or state rest stops. The
judge said that argument “sheds light on the city’s attitude towards its
homeless citizens” by seeking to drive them out or punish them if they
stay.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Advocates for televised presidential debates argue that they offer the
best chance voters will have during the campaign to get an extended look
at the candidates, beyond what they see in 30-second ads and 8-second
sound bites. We can hear them defend their records as they critique
their opponents, and answer tough questions from seasoned reporters
about key issues. It’s a rare opportunity to delve deep into substance
on important issues.
</p>
<p>
If only that were how televised debates actually turn out. The one
exchange on climate change that occurred in Thursday’s meeting between
Joe Biden and Donald Trump showed just how problematic a forum for voter
education this is.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps we should be thankful that Biden and Trump were asked a single
question about climate, since one is certainly more than zero.
Unfortunately, to consider what ensued at all enlightening, you’d have
to have a pretty low bar.
</p>
<p>
“Will you take any action as president to slow the climate crisis?”
co-moderator Dana Bash asked Trump. “Let me just go back to what he said
about the police,” Trump responded, then rambled for a while on a number
of topics, none of which were climate change. So Bash tried again:
“Thirty-eight seconds left, President Trump, will you take any action as
president to slow the climate crisis?” Trump’s answer was characteristic
gobbledygook:
</p>
<p>
“I want absolutely immaculate clean water. And I want absolutely clean
air and we had it. We had H2O. We had the best numbers ever, and we did
— we were using all forms of energy, all forms, everything. And yet,
during my four years I had the best environmental numbers ever, and my
top environmental people gave me that statistic just before I walked on
the stage, actually.”
</p>
<p>
Though no viewer would have any idea
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-debate-best-environmental-numbers" target="_self"><u>what
Trump was talking about</u></a> with “the best environmental numbers
ever,” I believe I know what he was referring to: Before the debate,
Trump
<a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112689786167440697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>posted</u></a>
on Truth Social some suggested talking points he got from Andrew
Wheeler, the coal lobbyist he appointed to lead the Environmental
Protection Agency, including that Trump should mention that carbon
emissions went down while he was president. It’s
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>true</u></a>
that emissions dipped in 2020, when you may remember there was a
pandemic that shut down much of the economy. That did not, however,
answer the question of what actions he would take in a second term.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps marveling at Trump’s claim that “we had H2O” when he was
president, Biden took a moment to respond. “I don’t know where the hell
he’s been,” the president finally said. “I passed the most extensive
climate change legislation in history.” It would have helped viewers
unfamiliar with the climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act if
Biden had at least mentioned some of them, such as money for research
into new sources of clean energy, incentives for domestic manufacturing
of green technology, grants to help farmers cut emissions, and tax
credits for electric vehicles and home electrification. After a
digression into HBCUs, Biden returned to the issue: “He hadn’t done a
damn thing for the environment. He pulled out of the Paris peace —
Climate Accord. I immediately joined it, because if we reach 1.5 degrees
Celsius at any one point there’s no way back. The only existential
threat to humanity is climate change, and he didn’t do a damn thing
about it. He wants to undo all that I’ve done.”
</p>
<p>
All of which is true, if probably too vague for most viewers to fully
understand. But it did include a statement conveying the seriousness of
the challenge (“The only existential threat to humanity is climate
change”), and reference to some relevant facts. That led Trump to a
criticism of the Paris agreement, that it’s “a rip-off of the United
States.”
</p>
<p>
But any viewer not familiar with the details of the agreement would have
had trouble following what Trump said; he seemed to be objecting to the
fact that the agreement called on developed countries to help less
developed countries adapt; he claimed that the agreement “was going to
cost us a trillion dollars,” one of many fictitious numbers he tossed
out. That left Biden to conclude that “we have made significant
progress” under his administration, and tout his new
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-american-climate-corps" target="_self"><u>Climate
Corps</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In all, it wasn’t the least substantive exchange on climate one could
imagine. A viewer who knew absolutely nothing about either of the
candidates’ records would have learned that they disagree on the Paris
agreement, and that Biden believes climate change is an existential
threat. But as with the rest of this debate — and almost every televised
debate — the best one can say from the standpoint of policy substance
is, “That could have been worse.”
</p>
<p>
And now that there has been one climate question, chances are the
moderators of the second debate will ignore the issue altogether. The
prevailing view among political reporters is that, sure, climate is
important, but the voters just don’t care about it all that much.
Convinced by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climate-inflation-poll" target="_self"><u>polls</u></a>
showing that other issues rank higher when voters are asked what their
most important priorities are, they usually segregate climate coverage
apart from the political stories that will dominate the news between now
and November.
</p>
<p>
That creates a self-fulfilling prophecy: When news organizations run a
thousand stories saying “Inflation dominates voter concerns” and then
ask voters what their concerns are, most of them are going to talk about
what seems to be on the political agenda. It’s not exactly a conspiracy
to downplay climate as an issue in the presidential race, but it has
much the same effect.
</p>
<p>
The savvy observer might suggest that it doesn’t really matter, since we
know where the two candidates stand on climate change and the contrast
couldn’t be clearer. And those of us who pay a great deal of attention
to both politics and the climate issue do understand the difference. But
that describes only a small portion of the electorate, which was why
this debate was another missed opportunity. Even if it could have been
worse.

<li>Biden squanders his climate moment at presidential debate
</h3>
<p>
Well, last night’s first 2024 debate between President Biden and Donald
Trump was “altogether distressing,”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/biden-trump-debate-paris-agreement?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_OSIOOhMAtwMIG46JMD9Cs_8otg3hDsgzRtiHq1c7jHGSnHtxewqYaOQjmxNqxvX5IedsT" rel="noopener" target="_self">writes
Heatmap’s Katie Brigham</a>. And while climate was far from the main
focus, the two candidates did have one notable exchange. Trump initially
dodged a question about whether he would take action to slow the climate
crisis, then briefly noted “I want absolutely immaculate clean water and
I want absolutely clean air. And we had it. We had H2O.” Biden responded
by criticizing Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement. “I
immediately [re]joined, because if we reach 1.5 degrees Celsius, at any
one point, there’s no way back,” Biden said. “The only existential
threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn’t do a damn thing
about it.”
</p>
<p>
Making Paris the focus of the debate’s one exchange around climate was
an odd choice, Brigham says. According to a poll conducted last November
by Heatmap, only 35% of Americans say they are at least “somewhat
familiar” with the Paris Agreement. The Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s
signature piece of climate legislation, didn’t come up once. (Not that
they’re that

that resonate with Americans, none of which were mentioned,” Brigham
adds.

an EPA environmental rule while it is challenged in a lower court. The
so-called good neighor plan would impose strict emissions limits on
power plants and other industrial sources in 23 states, and was intended
to prevent dangerous pollution that can cause breathing problems from
drifting across state lines. The rule has been challenged by a number of
Republican states, as well as companies. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that
those challenges were “likely to succeed on a claim that the Good
Neighbor Plan is ’arbitrary” or “capricious.’” The ruling blocks the EPA
from ramping up pollution limits while the challenges are being heard.
According to the EPA, the plan would prevent 1,300 premature deaths and
cut down on ER visits.

In a separate decision, the Interior Department also said it would
protect 28 million acres of land in Alaska that former President Donald
Trump had tried to make available for drilling and mining. President
Biden has a goal of conserving 30% of U.S. lands and waters.

movements and uncertainty in American politics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
A rule of thumb is that market players don’t like uncertainty. The
question this morning is whether there’s more or less of it in the wake
of President Joe Biden’s rough showing against former President Donald
Trump during last night’s debate. We’ll track how the debate is
affecting the movement of money. Plus, Social Security cuts are
inevitable by 2035 unless lawmakers act. Can a similar crunch from the
’80s offer guidance?

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
I grew up on a ranch in West Texas. Horses, rodeo, and roping were my
life. I was going to be a horse trainer. Then, when my life took a left
turn in high school, I got much more serious about music, started
writing songs, and ended up pursuing a music degree at the University of
North Texas.
</p>
<p>
After college, I had a 3-year stint in Portland, Oregon, where I started
the band
<a href="https://alisonwilder.net/voodoo-economics-accept-no-imitations/">Voodoo
Economics</a>. My bandmates and I moved to Philly in 2004-ish, where I
wrote for, played in, and produced for Voodoo while completing a
Master’s in music theory at Temple University. After a few years of
adjunct teaching, I decided a PhD in music theory &amp; cognition at
McGill University in Montreal was the right move, so I went off to do
that. The timing was epically bad – this was the beginning of the end of
the humanities in North American universities, after all – and I
realized after about a year that it would be nearly impossible to get a
job in a place where I actually wanted to live. So I packed up the piano
yet again and headed back to Philadelphia.
</p>
<p>
Back in Philly, I co-founded a music tech company with a super-cool and
interesting composer/pianist/technologist named Greg Wilder. After a
whirlwind couple of years in the depths of the music industry, we
decided to move away from daily ops with that company, and I was very
much at loose ends. I had never had any real marketable skills (don’t
try to tell me songwriting and music theory are marketable!), and I had
no idea what to do. So I asked Greg, <em>“What should I do?”</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Learn Linux,”</em> he said.
</p>
<p>
So I wiped my laptop, installed Debian, and was off to the races. Then I
said, <em>“but what should I do with Linux?”</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Maybe WordPress?”</em> he said.
</p>
<p>
It was 2011, and the timing couldn’t have been better. I learned
WordPress, started faffing about in PHP, Javascript, and all the rest,
and somehow people started writing checks. Over the last 13 years, Greg
and I have turned my faffing about into a couple of real businesses
(<a href="https://punktdigital.com/">Punkt Digital</a> and
<a href="https://wickedgoodweb.com/">Wicked Good Web</a>). At some point
during all of that, we got married, moved to New Hampshire, divorced,
and stayed best friends.
</p>
<p>
Though I stopped music completely for about 7 years after the start-up
(relationship status: it’s complicated), I’ve spent the last 6 years or
so building my studio back up and pouring myself into songwriting and
producing again (<a href="https://blixbyrd.bandcamp.com/">Blix Byrd</a>
and <a href="https://doctorbody.bandcamp.com/">Doctor Body</a> with
Greg). Which brings us to today. Phew!
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve always loved writing. Some days, I harbor secret aspirations to be
a real writer. (Uh-oh, secret’s out…) So blogging just comes naturally.
I don’t think of my blog as part of a business, or as a way to promote
myself exactly. It’s more of a place that gives me an outlet to organize
my thoughts publicly.
</p>
<p>
I generally find myself writing about a combination of daily life,
music, my own creative process, and things I’m doing or making. I
haven’t used social media much (although I’ve been enjoying
<a href="https://io.waxandleather.com/@alisynthesis">Mastodon</a> for
the last year or two!), so I sometimes use my blog as my own personal
Insta-book feed. It’s fun to make a quick post of something I like
and/or find amusing, and I enjoy perusing my old posts occasionally. My
memory isn’t the greatest, so in the case of daily life posts, I often
wouldn’t remember the thing at all if I didn’t blog about it!
</p>
<p>
Because blogging is purely for my own fun and enjoyment, I don’t force
myself to keep any kind of posting schedule. I just post when I feel
like it. I go through phases where that’s weekly, monthly, or even less.
So if you’re looking for a consistent presence in your RSS feed, my blog
is probably not for you.
</p>
<p>
I don’t have any blog posts from prior to my current website, although I
did have other blogs on Tumblr and early Squarespace over the years. It
looks like I started blogging on my own site in about 2014. See, told
you my memory was bad…I had to sign in to find out when my earliest
posts were!
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
My blogging process probably doesn’t qualify as a process. More like, “I
just blog when I feel like it and say whatever I want to.” That said, I
do also write quite a bit privately, so maybe it would be interesting to
explore the difference between my public and private writing?
</p>
<p>
I’m generally an open book – the kind of person who will tell strangers
whatever they want to know about me. That said, I do write differently
on my blog than in my personal journals. Obviously, I edit a lot more on
the blog. I also tend to post the kinds of things that I think others
might find interesting, which means I don’t often post about my own
internal thoughts and feelings.
</p>
<p>
That said, I enjoy reading blogs where people get personal, so now I’m
wondering why I don’t do that! Perhaps a topic for a future blog post?
</p>
<p>
And to the second question: the above paragraphs illustrate how I get my
inspiration – navel gazing and over-thinking. ;)
</p>
<p>
For quick posts, I write directly in WordPress. For longer bits or
things that come out of my private journaling, I write in Markdown in
Obsidian. (Yes, I’m one of those obsessive Obsidian people.)
</p>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
I’m a very aesthetically-minded person who is most satisfied when I feel
like I’m immersed in beautiful and creative objects. I’ve tried to craft
my home environment so that I feel inspired in every seat in the house.
Right now, I’m sitting on my back porch looking my gardens and typing on
my laptop. It’s May in New Hampshire, and you can almost hear the plants
growing.
</p>
<p>
I tend to write short bits on my laptop wherever I want to be sitting,
because my office/studio is a place I work seriously. That said, my
studio is beautiful, ergonomic, and has a powerful computer, so anything
that takes awhile or requires lots of research/editing/photo work, I’ll
tend to do there.
</p>
<p>
I don’t typically listen to music while I work, because my brain won’t
agree to keep it in the background. And if music can be in the
background, I probably don’t want to hear it at all. (Not a judgment
about wallpaper music, that’s just how it is for me.) So there’s lots of
silence at my house.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
Greg and I operate our own managed WordPress hosting platform (Digital
Ocean + Serverpilot) for our clients, so we also host all of our own
personal websites there. How convenient!
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I think about switching to a static site generator, and have
certainly enjoyed playing around with them and occasionally using them
for client projects, but since I know so much about WordPress, it’s
kinda my default.
</p>
<p>
We register all our domains at Namecheap, which has been rock solid over
the years.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
I don’t think so. If I weren’t a WordPress person for work, I would
probably use a static site generator and really enjoy that experience. I
could easily see using an Obsidian vault at my CMS, and in face, I
maintain a public-not-public recipe site where I do exactly that, using
Obsidian to write, and Jekyll to website.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
That’s a tough question since we run our own Digital Ocean servers. If I
were a client of ours, I would pay $486/year for our managed hosting
plan. But since I’m not, I don’t.
</p>
<p>
My blog generates absolutely no revenue. I haven’t tried, and I doubt I
will, because I prefer keeping my creative life separate from my
financial life. (Now that’s a blog post topic! I’m surprised I haven’t
written about that before. Who knows, maybe I have.)
</p>
<p>
That said, I don’t see anything wrong with other people monetizing their
blog. More power to ’em! I don’t regularly financially support any
bloggers, although I do tend to throw folks the occasional bone when I
enjoy their work for awhile.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
Here’s a
<a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/4QTNCKWFYW#fX4XAW0GJI4Z">link to
all the personal blogs I subscribe to</a> in my RSS reader:
</p>
<p>
A few quick blog recs:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Gotta plug <a href="https://gregwilder.com">Greg Wilder’s blog</a>,
which is an awesome and regularly-updated account of being a
composer/pianist/synthesizer wizard/mountain man.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://ruk.ca/">Peter Rukavina</a> is a writer, printer and
developer on Prince Edward Island. I don’t know him, but I so enjoy his
description of his life on his blog. He seems like a wonderful person!
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://rubenerd.com/">Ruben Schade</a> is an prolific
blogger/developer who I also don’t know, but whose writing style and
perspective I totally enjoy.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
I’ve been obsessed with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Strickland_(director)">Peter
Strickland</a>’s films over the last few years. Berberian Sound Studio
and its soundtrack (by the super-cool band Broadcast) are AMAZING. Check
them out if your taste tends toward the weird and wild.
</p>
<p>
More in weird electronic music: don’t sleep on Mort Garson. He may be
dead, but <a href="https://mortgarson.bandcamp.com/">he’s still on
Bandcamp</a>!
</p>

A compiler cannot catch all semantic errors. An infinite recursion is
often not caught by a compiler. Again, I argue for (in)completeness
reasons: it would, probably, be not that difficult to catch cases like
this one
</p>
<div class="gl-relative markdown-code-block js-markdown-code">
<pre data-sourcepos="2:1-7:3" class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight language-plaintext" v-pre="true"><code><span id="LC1" class="line" lang="plaintext">PROCEDURE P();</span>

<span id="LC3" class="line" lang="plaintext">  P()</span>
<span id="LC4" class="line" lang="plaintext">END P;</span></code></pre>
<p><copy-code></copy-code></p>
</div>
<p data-sourcepos="8:1-8:153" dir="auto">
but it already becomes more difficult when the error is not that obvious
any more like in the following wrong attempt to implement the factorial
function
</p>
<div class="gl-relative markdown-code-block js-markdown-code">
<pre data-sourcepos="9:1-16:3" class="code highlight js-syntax-highlight language-plaintext" v-pre="true"><code><span id="LC1" class="line" lang="plaintext">PROCEDURE F(i: INTEGER): INTEGER;</span>

So, for the time being, I don't know how to handle this. The compiler
would need to do much more sophisticated things than it is currently
doing in order to detect a lot of infinite recursion cases (and it would
never be guaranteed to catch all cases).

The example I made was pretty artificial and I don't think it is a good
idea to mark errors (only) for very special situations. If at all, we
might issue a warning when a local variable is returned by reference
because this is a case that can easily happen. But, to be honest, I am
not that happy with this kind of incomplete solution either. The concept
of return by reference is inherently dangerous and we will have to live
with it or get rid of the concept altogether. I prefer the former
because I cannot stand having getters and setters all over the place
when an assignment operator shall be overloaded – here I prefer the C++
way over the Java way. (Niklaus Wirth would not have admitted a return
by reference in the first place).

Had His Climate Moment and He Used It to Talk About Paris</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxNjIwNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNjkzNzAyMX0.oi8XXMuP0hbK5GwPW6T6Fh_2Yc5pVHaj_DhlrY18ADs/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
In an altogether distressing debate in which climate was far from a main
focus, the two candidates did have one notable exchange regarding the
Paris Agreement. The 2015 treaty united most countries around the world
in setting a goal to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees
Celsius, with 1.5 degrees as the ultimate target.
</p>
<p>
After Trump initially dodged a question about whether he would take
action to slow the climate crisis, he then briefly noted “I want
absolutely immaculate clean water and I want absolutely clean air. And
we had it. We had H2O.”
</p>
<p>
While it is true that there was H2O during Trump’s presidency, Biden
responded by criticizing Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris
Agreement. “I immediately [re]joined, because if we reach 1.5 degrees
Celsius, at any one point, there’s no way back,” Biden said. “The only
existential threat to humanity is climate change. And he didn’t do a
damn thing about it.”
</p>
<p>
But according to a poll conducted last November by Heatmap, only 35% of
Americans say they are at least “somewhat familiar” with the Paris
Agreement at all, perhaps making it an odd choice to anchor the debate’s
one exchange around climate. By contrast, the Inflation Reduction Act,
Biden’s signature piece of climate legislation, didn’t come up once.
(Not that they’re
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self"><u>that
familiar with the IRA</u></a>, either.) Solar, wind, carbon emissions —
all terms that resonate with Americans, none of which were mentioned.
</p>
<p>
Of his decisions to leave the Paris Agreement in 2017, Trump claimed,
“The Paris Accord was going to cost us $1 trillion,” while it would cost
China, Russia, and India “nothing.”
</p>
<p>
The $1 trillion number actually appears to be a discount on Trump’s
previously cited estimate.
<a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accord/" target="_blank"><u>In
his Rose Garden address</u></a> announcing his decision to exit the
agreement, he said that by 2040, compliance would entail a cost to the
economy that would approach “$3 trillion in lost GDP and 6.5 million
industrial jobs,” citing
<a href="https://www.globalenergyinstitute.org/sites/default/files/NERA%20Final%20Report%202.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
study </u></a>conducted by NERA Economic Consulting.
</p>
<p>
According to the fact-checking website
<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jan/21/wayne-christian/attacking-paris-accord-texas-oil-regulator-selecti/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>PolitiFact</u></a>,
the study’s authors were explicit that these projections are highly
uncertain and do not take into account all the job gains and GDP growth
that could be associated with the energy transition. PolitiFact also
said NERA put forth a news release (which now appears to be unavailable
online) stating that “the Trump administration selectively used results”
from its study, and that “NERA’s study was not a cost-benefit analysis
of the Paris Agreement, nor does it purport to be one.”
</p>
<p>
When Trump said that China, Russia, and India would not have financial
commitments under the Paris Agreement, he was perhaps referencing the
obligation (which the Paris Agreement reaffirmed) for wealthier nations
like the U.S. to direct hundreds of billions of dollars to poorer
nations to both aid their transition to clean energy and help them adapt
to the impacts of climate change.
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-67610621" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>It’s
true that there’s controversy</u></a> around whether China or India,
which have giant (but still developing) economies, should either provide
this funding or receive this funding. Russia, which joined the agreement
in 2019, hasn’t really been a part of this conversation though.
</p>
<p>
In response to Trump’s defense of his decision to exit the agreement,
Biden countered, “We were the only ones of consequence who were not
members of the Paris Accord. How can we do anything if the United States
can’t get its pollution under control?” He said the U.S. had made
significant progress on climate, and while it felt like a moment to, I
don’t know, note the job growth from the administration’s investment in
cleantech manufacturing (in predominantly
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/renewable-energy-texas-senate-voting" target="_self"><u>red
states</u></a>), Biden instead cited
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-american-climate-corps" target="_self"><u>the
formation of the Climate Corps</u></a>, a nice but thus-far modest
fellowship program that puts young Americans to work fighting the
climate crisis. Most of the public likely hasn’t heard of it, and Biden
has been mostly quiet about it of late.
</p>
<p>
The exchange ended when Biden said, “We’re moving in directions that are
going to significantly change the elemental cause of pollution. But the
idea that [Trump] claims that he has the biggest heart up here and is
really concerned about pollution, and about climate, I’ve not seen any
indication of that.”
</p>
<p>
And just like that, it was onto prescription drugs, who is better at
golf, and Trump’s weight. You know, the usual debate stuff.

<h2 id="what-were-trumps-environmental-numbers-actually">What Were
Trump’s ‘Environmental Numbers,’ Actually?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
Former President Donald Trump has been known, on occasion,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/24/trumps-false-or-misleading-claims-total-30573-over-four-years/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
exaggerate</u></a>. Still, an assertion he made during the first
presidential debate on Thursday night is one for the books: “During my
four years, I had the best environmental numbers ever,” he said.
</p>
<p>
It was “unclear” what Trump was “talking about,” <em><em>The New York
Times</em></em>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/27/us/biden-trump-debate/1fe60bcd-b3f2-52f8-a321-4b343de2fca6?smid=url-share" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>diplomatically
said</u></a>. But Thursday was hardly the first time
<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/09/donald-trump-environment-roosevelt#:~:text=Trump%20compared%20himself%20to%20conservationist,%E2%80%9CI%20am%2C%20I%20am." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Trump
has claimed</u></a> to be “the number one” environmentalist president.
He’s said that the “environment is very important to me” and that “I’m a
big believer in that word: the environment.” And for proof,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/01/09/this-is-perhaps-trumps-most-cynical-comment-about-environment-yet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he’s
historically pointed to</u></a> a book written by a longtime Trump
Organization staffer that called him “An Environmental Hero” as well as
the fact that “I did the best environmental impact statements.”
</p>
<p>
Trump’s actions tell a different story. Despite insisting on Thursday
that he wants “absolutely immaculate clean water and … absolutely clean
air,” Trump’s Project 2025 roadmap for a second term
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>describes</u></a>
targeting California’s Clean Air Act waiver, reducing fuel economy
requirements, and making it harder to keep big polluters in check.
Trump’s presidential record also speaks for itself: During his four
years in office, he
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/climate-environment/trump-climate-environment-protections/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled
back</u></a> 100 environmental rules or more, including
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/climate/trump-environment-water.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>removing</u></a>
pollution controls on streams and wetlands and
<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/08/trump-coal-plan-will-kill-1400-americans-a-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gutting</u></a>
Obama-era emission standards. According to
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/trump-s-environment-policies-killed-thousands-scientists-say" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
estimate</u></a> in the esteemed British medical journal <em><em>The
Lancet</em></em>, Trump’s environmental policies resulted in 22,000
deaths in 2019 alone. He’s been described as
<a href="https://www.ecowatch.com/trump-worst-president-environment-2645034831.html?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
worst president</u></a> for the environment in U.S. history.
</p>
<p>
President Biden put it even more succinctly in his rebuttal: Trump has
“not done a damn thing for the environment.”

former police officials indicted over Uvalde shooting response, reports
say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>AUSTIN, Texas — The former Uvalde schools police chief and another
former officer have been indicted over their role in the slow police
response to the 2022 massacre at a Texas elementary school that left 19
children and two teachers dead, according to multiple reports
Thursday.</p>
<p>The Uvalde Leader-News and the San Antonio Express-News reported
former schools police Chief Pete Arredondo and former officer Adrian
Gonzales were indicted by a grand jury on multiple counts of felony
child endangerment and abandonment. The Uvalde Leader-News reported that
District Attorney Christina Mitchell confirmed the indictment. </p>
<p>The Austin American-Statesman also reported two former officers had
been indicted but did not identify them.</p>
<p>Mitchell did not immediately return messages from The Associated
Press seeking comment. Several family members of victims of the shooting
did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.</p>
<p>The indictments would make Arredondo, who was the on-site commander
during the attack, and Gonzales the first officers to face criminal
charges in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. A
scathing report by Texas lawmakers that examined the police response
described Gonzales as one of the first officers to enter the building
after the shooting began.</p>
<p>The indictments were kept under seal until the men were in custody,
and both were expected to turn themselves in by Friday, the news outlets
reported. The indictments come more than two years after an 18-year-old
gunman opened fire in a fourth-grade classroom, where he remained for
more than 70 minutes before officers confronted and killed him. In
total, 376 law enforcement officers massed at Robb Elementary School on
May 24, 2022, some waiting in the hallway outside the classroom, even as
the gunman could be heard firing an AR-15-style rifle inside.</p>
<p>The office of a former attorney for Arredondo said they did not know
whether the former chief has new representation. The AP could not
immediately find a phone number to reach Gonzales.</p>
<p>Arredondo lost his job three months after the shooting. Several
officers involved were eventually fired, and separate investigations by
the Department of Justice and state lawmakers faulted law enforcement
with botching their response to the massacre.</p>
<p>Whether any officers would face criminal charges over their actions
in Uvalde has been a question hanging over the city of 15,000 since the
Texas Rangers completed their investigation and turned their findings
over to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Mitchell’s office has also come under scrutiny. Uvalde city officials
filed a lawsuit last year that accused prosecutors of not being
transparent and withholding records related to the shooting. Media
outlets, including the AP, have sued Uvalde officials for withholding
records requested under public information laws.</p>
<p>But body camera footage, investigations by journalists and damning
government reports have laid bare how over the course of over an hour, a
mass of officers went in and out of the school with weapons drawn but
did not go inside the classroom where the shooting was taking place. The
hundreds of officers at the scene included state police, Uvalde police,
school officers and U.S. Border Patrol agents.</p>
<p>In their July 2022 report, Texas lawmakers faulted law enforcement at
every level with failing “to prioritize saving innocent lives over their
own safety.” The Justice Department released its own report in January
that detailed “cascading failures” by police in waiting far too long to
confront the gunman, acting with “no urgency” in establishing a command
post and communicating inaccurate information to grieving families.</p>
<p>Uvalde remains divided between residents who say they want to move
past the tragedy and others who still want answers and accountability.
During the first mayoral race since the shooting, locals voted in a man
who had served as mayor more than a decade ago over a mother who led
calls for tougher gun laws after her daughter was killed in the
attack.</p>
<p>Robb Elementary School is now permanently closed. The city broke
ground on a new school in October 2023.</p>

<p>date: 2024-06-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The International Monetary Fund on Thursday called on
the U.S. to raise taxes to curb rising debt levels while applauding
“robust, dynamic” growth in the world’s largest economy and progress
toward bringing inflation under control.</p>
<p>The IMF said in a closing statement for its “Article IV” review of
U.S. economic policies that high deficits and debt “create a growing
risk to the U.S. and global economy, potentially feeding into higher
fiscal financing costs and a growing risk to the smooth rollover of
maturing obligations.”</p>
<p>The IMF’s statement slightly revised down its 2024 U.S. GDP growth
forecast to 2.6% from the 2.7% forecast in the global lender’s World
Economic Outlook in April.</p>
<p>The IMF forecasts U.S. growth in 2025 to dip to 1.9%, unchanged from
the April outlook, and remaining above 2% through the end of the
decade.</p>
<p>“The U.S. economy has proven itself to be robust, dynamic and
adaptable to changing global conditions,” the IMF said. “Activity and
employment continue to expectations … and the disinflation process has
been considerably less costly than many had feared.”</p>
<p>The IMF said it expects U.S. inflation to return to the Federal
Reserve’s 2% target by mid-2025, considerably sooner than the Fed’s own
forecast of returning to target in 2026.</p>
<p>IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters that the
IMF’s forecast is more optimistic because of the current trajectory of
inflation indicates a quicker return to target, partly because strong
U.S. consumer spending driven by wealth built up during the COVID-19
pandemic is subsiding and the labor market is cooling.</p>
<p>Debt, trade prescriptions</p>
<p>But the IMF chided Washington for rising deficits that, if continued,
would bring the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio to a concerning level of 140% by
the end of the decade. The IMF measure includes Social Security pension
and Medicare health care obligations.</p>
<p>“Such high deficits and debt create a growing risk to the U.S. and
global economy, potentially feeding into higher fiscal financing costs
and a growing risk to the smooth rollover of maturing obligations,” the
Fund said.</p>
<p>For the second year in a row, the fund prescribed that the U.S.
increase income tax rates progressively, not only on the wealthiest
Americans but also for households earning less than $400,000 a year — a
threshold that U.S. President Joe Biden has vowed not to cross in his
re-election campaign pledges.</p>
<p>The fund said the U.S. also should reform entitlement programs, cuts
that Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump have both vowed not to
pursue, and raise the threshold for eligibility for the Earned Income
Tax Credit for workers without children.</p>
<p>Georgieva said the fund was trying to present a policy path for the
U.S. “that in our view would serve the economy and its people well,” as
it would for any IMF member country.</p>
<p>With the U.S. economy strong, it was a “good time” for the U.S. to
consolidate its fiscal position, she said, adding: “It is in good times
where you can do more to prepare yourself for risks in the future.”</p>
<p>The IMF also said that intensifying U.S. tariffs and other trade
barriers along with the increased use of industrial policy to favor
domestic firms represented a downside risk for the U.S. and global
economies, with the potential to distort investment flows and undermine
the global trading system.</p>
<p>Instead, the fund called for Washington to work out differences with
trading partners through negotiations and strengthen the World Trade
Organization.</p>
<p>In her discussion with Georgieva, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen reiterated the importance of “frank and thorough assessments” of
IMF member economies and discussed the “remarkable performance of the
U.S. economy over the past few years,” the Treasury said.</p>

state superintendent orders schools to teach the Bible in schools</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>oklahoma city, oklahoma — Oklahoma’s top education official on
Thursday ordered public schools to incorporate the Bible into lessons
for grades 5 through 12, the latest effort by conservatives to
incorporate religion into classrooms.</p>
<p>The directive drew immediate condemnation from civil rights groups
and supporters of the separation of church and state, with some calling
it an abuse of power and a violation of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>The order sent to districts across the state by Republican State
Superintendent Ryan Walters says adherence to the mandate is compulsory
and “immediate and strict compliance is expected.”</p>
<p>“The Bible is an indispensable historical and cultural touchstone,”
Walters said in a statement. “Without basic knowledge of it, Oklahoma
students are unable to properly contextualize the foundation of our
nation which is why Oklahoma educational standards provide for its
instruction.”</p>
<p>Oklahoma law already explicitly allows Bibles in the classroom and
lets teachers use them in instruction, said Phil Bacharach, a spokesman
for state Attorney General Gentner Drummond.</p>
<p>But it’s not clear if Walters has the authority to mandate that
schools teach it. State law says individual school districts have the
exclusive authority to decide on instruction, curriculum, reading lists,
instructional materials and textbooks.</p>
<p>The head of the Oklahoma chapter of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations criticized the directive as a clear violation of the
Constitution’s Establishment Clause, which prohibits the government from
“establishing” a religion.</p>
<p>“We adamantly oppose any requirements that religion be forcefully
taught or required as a part of lesson plans in public schools, in
Oklahoma, or anywhere else in the country,” Adam Soltani said in a
statement.</p>
<p>“Public schools are not Sunday schools,” Rachel Laser, president and
CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said in a
statement. “This is textbook Christian Nationalism: Walters is abusing
the power of his public office to impose his religious beliefs on
everyone else’s children. Not on our watch.”</p>
<p>The directive is the latest salvo in an effort by conservative-led
states to target public schools: Louisiana has required them to post the
Ten Commandments in classrooms, while others are under pressure to teach
the Bible and ban books and lessons about race, sexual orientation and
gender identity.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the Oklahoma Supreme Court blocked an attempt by
the state to have the first publicly funded religious charter school in
the country.</p>
<p>A former public school teacher who was elected to his post in 2022,
Walters ran on a platform of fighting “woke ideology,” banning books
from school libraries and getting rid of “radical leftists” who he
claims are indoctrinating children in classrooms.</p>
<p>He has clashed with leaders in both parties for his focus on
culture-war issues including transgender rights and banning books, and
in January he faced criticism for appointing a right-wing social media
influencer from New York to a state library committee.</p>

<h2 id="cnn-bans-white-house-pool-reporters-from-debate-room">CNN bans
White House pool reporters from debate room</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The White House Correspondents’ Association said
Thursday that CNN had rejected multiple requests to include White House
pool reporters inside the studio during the first presidential debate
between incumbent Joe Biden and Republican rival Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The press pool, made up of representatives of major news
organizations, accompanies the president on foreign and domestic trips
and normally has access to any event where he speaks or appears in
public, with the goal of keeping the U.S. public informed. </p>
<p>It is extremely rare for it to be barred from an event in the United
States. </p>
<p>“WHCA is deeply concerned that CNN has rejected our repeated requests
to include the White House travel pool inside the studio,” Kelly
O’Donnell, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association,
said in a statement. </p>
<p>“The pool is there for the ‘what ifs?’ in a world where the
unexpected does happen,” she said, and to provide “context and insight
by direct observation and not through the lens of the television
production.” </p>
<p>These reporters are there to see what is said and done when the
microphones and cameras are off, and provide independent observation,
she wrote, with duties “separate from the production of the debate as a
news event.” </p>
<p>O’Donnell said both the Biden and Trump campaigns agreed to the
WHCA’s request. </p>
<p>CNN has agreed to allow only one White House print pool reporter to
enter the studio during a commercial break to “briefly observe the
setting.” </p>
<p>The network will also allow still photographers from other outlets to
cover the candidates inside the studio and will provide a television
feed of the debate to other networks. </p>
<p>CNN has put in place many other rules for the first showdown,
including two commercial breaks, no props and muted microphones except
when the candidates are recognized to speak. The network did not respond
to a request for comment. </p>
<p>“Precedent matters for future debates,” O’Donnell said, alluding to
the next Biden-Trump face-off in September. </p>
<p>The National Association of Black Journalists also asked CNN to
accredit reporters from local Black-owned news organizations, after none
of Atlanta’s Black news groups got credentials to be on-site for the
debate.</p>

id="windows-10-will-be-covered-by-0patch-a-third-party-paid-patching-service">Windows
10 will be covered by 0patch, a third-party paid patching service</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>So I learned something new today: there are companies that provide
security patches for Windows that aren’t Microsoft. I never even
considered this could be a thing, but it turns out that a paid service
called 0patch seems to have been around for a long time, and the
consensus seems to be that not only can it be trusted, it also sometimes
provides patches sooner than Microsoft does. Today, 0patch announced
it’ll also be providing this service for Windows 10 after the end of
support next year. With October 2025, 0patch will “security-adopt”
Windows 10 v22H2, and provide critical security patches for it for at
least 5 more years – even longer if there’s demand on the market. We’re
the only provider of unofficial security patches for Windows (“virtual
patches” are not really patches), and we have done this many times
before: after security-adopting Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 in
January 2020, we took care of 6 versions of Windows 10 as their official
support ended, security-adopted Windows 11 v21H2 to keep users who got
stuck there secure, took care of Windows Server 2012 in October 2023 and
adopted two popular Office versions – 2010 and 2013 – when they got
abandoned by Microsoft. We’re still providing security patches for all
of these. ↫ Mitja Kolsek on the 0patch blog This service implements
patching through what it calls “micropatches”, which are very small sets
of CPU instructions injected into running code in memory without
modifying – in this case – Microsoft’s own code. These micropatches are
applied by briefly stopping the offending program, injecting the fix,
and continuing the program – without having to close the program or
reboot. Of course, they can be unapplied in the same, non-disruptive
way. The 0patch service will provide patches for 0days that Microsoft
hasn’t fixed yet, patches for issues Microsoft won’t fix, and sometimes
patches for third party code. As the headline clearly states, this
service isn’t free, but honestly, at roughly 25 dollars plus tax per
computer per year, it’s not exactly expensive, and definitely cheaper
than Microsoft’s own Windows 10 Extended Security Update program it’s
going to offer for Windows 10 after the end of support date next year.
Diving a bit deeper into who is providing this service, it comes from a
company called ACROS Security, a small company out of Slovenia. The
company details its micropatches on its 0patch blog if you want more
information on how each individual ones works. I still don’t know
exactly what to make of this, and I definitely wouldn’t rely on
something like this for mission-critical Windows computers or servers,
but for something like a home PC that can’t be upgraded to Windows 11
but still works just fine, or perhaps some disposable virtual machines

id="new-migration-patterns-could-fuel-is-plans-for-us-some-officials-contend">New
migration patterns could fuel IS plans for US, some officials
contend</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Recent changes in global migration patterns and
smuggling routes have created an opening for terror groups like the
Islamic State to set their sights on the U.S. southern border.</p>
<p>For years, top U.S. counterterrorism officials have pushed back
against critics who sounded alarms about would-be terrorists streaming
across the U.S. border with Mexico. But changes within the past year
have increased the likelihood of such a reality.</p>
<p>“What we face today is a greater vulnerability to the possibility
that terrorist organizations might use that pathway to get individuals
into the United States,” according to Nick Rasmussen, the
counterterrorism coordinator for the Department of Homeland Security, or
DHS.</p>
<p>“The diversity of the migrant population arriving at our borders —
this is not in any way, shape or form a problem of the Western
Hemisphere,” Rasmussen told a conference Thursday in Omaha,
Nebraska.</p>
<p>“It’s a global migration problem with migrants from literally every
corner of the world, including from most conflict zones around the
world, showing up and arriving on our shores,” he said, describing the
convergence of the migration routes with concerns about terror groups
like Islamic State “relatively recent.”</p>
<p>Concerns about possible infiltration by migrants linked to the
Islamic State, also known as IS or ISIS, have spiked in recent
weeks.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, The New York Post reported the FBI arrested eight
men from Tajikistan who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border partly with the
help of an IS-linked network.</p>
<p>And earlier this week, NBC News reported more than 400 immigrants
from Central Asia crossed into the U.S., again with help from IS-linked
smugglers. Of those, some 150 have been arrested, while another 50
remain at large. The officials did not comment on the status of the
remaining 200.</p>
<p>Senior DHS officials say there is no evidence to suggest any of the
400 Central Asian migrants are IS operatives.</p>
<p>But officials have said the eight men from Tajikistan were arrested
because of potential ties to IS. All eight are in the middle of removal
hearings and face deportation.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have sought to allay concerns.</p>
<p>White House deputy homeland security adviser Jen Daskal told the
counterterrorism conference in Omaha on Wednesday that there is now
increased vigilance along the U.S. southern border.</p>
<p>“We have enhanced our screening and vetting, instituted recurrent
vetting of migrants to identify newly uncovered threats and detain those
who pose a public safety threat,” Daskal said. “We know that there is a
continued risk posed by those inspired by these terrorist organizations,
and we are acutely focused on that risk.”</p>
<p>Rasmussen, speaking a day later, likewise pushed back against fears
of a terrorist free for all.</p>
<p>“Most of the last decade there have been political critics who have
said that terrorists are streaming across the southern border, and we
could look at that analytically as our intelligence and law enforcement
really did, and say, no, that’s actually not happening,” he said. “I
would argue it’s not true today, as well.”</p>
<p>Rasmussen agreed, though, the newfound focus by groups like IS on
exploiting migration to the Western Hemisphere deserves immediate
attention.</p>
<p>The convergence of migration patterns and terrorism is “probably
highest on my worry and priority list today,” he said.</p>

Russia-North Korea ties may create opportunity for US, China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The recent defense pact between Russia and North Korea
could present a diplomatic opportunity for the United States and China
to work together for stability on the Korean Peninsula, an issue of
mutual interest to both countries, some experts say.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Monday that China
would be “somewhat anxious” about enhanced cooperation between Russia
and North Korea, adding that Chinese officials have “indicated so in
some of our interactions, and we can see some tension associated with
those things.”</p>
<p>White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters
after the Russia-North Korea summit last week in Pyongyang that concern
about the new defense agreement between the two countries “would be
shared by the People’s Republic of China” — China’s official name.</p>
<p>During their keenly watched summit, Russian President Vladmir Putin
and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic
partnership treaty, vowing to challenge the U.S.-led world order.</p>
<p>Under the treaty, the two countries, which share a short border along
the lower Tumen River, are now required to provide military assistance
using all available means if either of them is attacked by a third
country.</p>
<p>High-precision weapons</p>
<p>Putin further raised the stakes in this newly cemented relationship,
saying he is not ruling out the possibility of Russia providing
high-precision weapons to North Korea.</p>
<p>According to some experts in Washington, China’s frustration with its
two neighbors could make room for a Sino-American effort to dissuade
Russia and North Korea from moving forward with their nascent defense
pact.</p>
<p>Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson
Institute, told VOA’s Korean Service earlier this week that there is a
way for the U.S. to find “some common ground” with China on this
issue.</p>
<p>He explained that it is in China’s interest not to see the transfer
of Russia’s advanced, offensive military technologies to North Korea,
which could be destabilizing on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>“That opens up a common ground for the United States to deal with
China to limit any destabilizing transfer of technology to the Korean
Peninsula,” he said.</p>
<p>Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party
denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, told VOA’s
Korean Service on Wednesday that the U.S. and China need to come
together on this issue.</p>
<p>DeTrani said North Korea has to be on the list of “the issues of
mutual concern” between the top two powers, as the U.S. pursues dialogue
with China on subjects such as artificial intelligence and trade.</p>
<p>Dennis Wilder, who served as senior director for East Asia affairs at
the White House’s National Security Council during the George W. Bush
administration, was more cautious about the possibility of U.S.-China
coordination.</p>
<p>Wilder told VOA’s Korean Service this week that the current state of
U.S.-China relations makes Beijing averse to working with Washington on
North Korea.</p>
<p>“No, they have no interest in joining with us, considering how they
feel we are treating them,” Wilder said. “I very much doubt that the
Chinese would be interested. A far possibility would be that they might
want to share information, but that would be the only place.”</p>
<p>No ties to call on</p>
<p>Robert Gallucci, who was the chief U.S. negotiator during the 1994
North Korea nuclear crisis, offered a similar view.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a relationship with Beijing right now that we could
call on,” he said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Gallucci told VOA’s Korean Service that China will not appreciate the
possibility of its influence on North Korea being undercut.</p>
<p>Gary Samore, who served as the White House coordinator for arms
control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration,
told VOA’s Korean Service via email on Wednesday that China might have a
limited influence on what is happening between Russia and North Korea,
although Washington and Beijing share an interest in keeping things calm
on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>“I expect that Beijing will discourage any military assistance from
Russia to North Korea that could be destabilizing,” he said. “Whether
Putin or Kim Jong Un will respect China’s wishes, I can’t say.”</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told
VOA’s Korean Service via email earlier this week that “in principle,
China welcomes Russia to consolidate and develop traditional friendly
relations with relevant countries,” without referring to North
Korea.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington is holding out hope that Beijing can still
leverage its historical ties with Pyongyang to drive a solution.</p>
<p>“We urge Beijing to use its influence to encourage the DPRK
[Democratic People’s Republic of Korea] to refrain from destabilizing
behavior and return to the negotiating table,” a State Department
spokesperson told VOA’s Korean Service on Wednesday.</p>

sanctions Iran over nuclear escalations, petroleum transport</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Thursday issued fresh sanctions
targeting Iran in response to “continued nuclear escalations,” U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Over the past month, Iran has announced steps to further expand its
nuclear program in ways that have no credible peaceful purpose,” Blinken
said. “We remain committed to never letting Iran obtain a nuclear
weapon, and we are prepared to use all elements of national power to
ensure that outcome.”</p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately
respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Thursday’s action imposes sanctions on three companies based in the
United Arab Emirates the U.S. accused of being involved in the transport
of Iranian petroleum or petrochemical products, as well as 11 associated
vessels.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Group of Seven advanced industrialized
economies warned Iran against advancing its nuclear enrichment program,
and members said they would be ready to enforce new measures if Tehran
were to transfer ballistic missiles to Russia.</p>
<p>Iran rebuked the statement, calling on the G7 to distance itself from
“destructive policies of the past,” said Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Nasser Kanaani.</p>
<p>Earlier in June, the United Nations nuclear watchdog’s 35-nation
Board of Governors passed a resolution calling on Iran to step up
cooperation with the watchdog and reverse its recent barring of
inspectors.</p>
<p>Iran is enriching uranium to up to 60% purity — close to the 90% of
weapons grade — and has enough material enriched to that level, if
enriched further, for three nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA
yardstick.</p>
<p>Western powers say there is no credible civilian reason for that.
Iran says its aims are entirely peaceful, but officials have recently
said it could change its “nuclear doctrine” if it is attacked or its
existence was threatened by arch-foe Israel. That has prompted alarm at
the IAEA and in Western capitals.</p>

nonprofit sues ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft for ‘exploitative’
copyright infringement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — The Center for Investigative Reporting said Thursday it
has sued ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its closest business partner,
Microsoft, marking a new front in the news industry’s fight against
unauthorized use of its content on artificial intelligence
platforms.</p>
<p>The nonprofit, which produces Mother Jones and Reveal, said that
OpenAI used its content without permission and without offering
compensation, violating copyrights on the organization’s journalism. The
lawsuit, filed in a New York federal court, describes OpenAI’s business
as “built on the exploitation of copyrighted works” and focuses on how
AI-generated summaries of articles threaten publishers.</p>
<p>“It’s immensely dangerous,” Monika Bauerlein, the nonprofit’s CEO,
told The Associated Press. “Our existence relies on users finding our
work valuable and deciding to support it.”</p>
<p>Bauerlein said that “when people can no longer develop that
relationship with our work, when they no longer encounter Mother Jones
or Reveal, then their relationship is with the AI tool.”</p>
<p>That, she said, could “cut the entire foundation of our existence as
an independent newsroom out from under us” while also threatening the
future of other news organizations.</p>
<p>OpenAI and Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to requests for
comment Thursday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is the latest against OpenAI and Microsoft to land at
Manhattan’s federal court, where the companies are already battling a
series of other copyright lawsuits from The New York Times, other media
outlets and bestselling authors such as John Grisham, Jodi Picoult and
George R.R. Martin. The companies also face a separate case in San
Francisco’s federal court brought by authors including comedian Sarah
Silverman.</p>
<p>Some news organizations have chosen to collaborate rather than fight
with OpenAI by signing deals to get compensated for sharing news content
that can be used to train its AI systems. The latest to do so is Time
magazine, which announced Thursday that OpenAI will get access to its
“extensive archives from the last 101 years.”</p>
<p>OpenAI and other major AI developers don’t typically disclose their
data sources but have argued that taking troves of publicly accessible
online text, images and other media to train their AI systems is
protected by the “fair use” doctrine of American copyright law.</p>
<p>CIR’s lawsuit says a dataset that OpenAI has acknowledged using to
build an earlier version of its chatbot technology contained thousands
of links to the website of Mother Jones, a 48-year-old print magazine
that’s been publishing online since 1993. But the text used for AI
training was usually missing information about a story’s author, title
or copyright notice.</p>
<p>Last summer, more than 4,000 writers signed a letter to the CEOs of
OpenAI and other tech companies accusing them of exploitative practices
in building chatbots.</p>
<p>“It’s not a free resource for these AI companies to ingest and make
money on,” Bauerlein said of news media. “They pay for office space.
They pay for electricity. They pay salaries for their workers. Why would
the content that they ingest be the only thing that they don’t [pay
for]?”</p>
<p>The AP is among the news organizations that have made licensing deals
over the past year with OpenAI; others include The Wall Street Journal
and the New York Post publisher News Corp., The Atlantic, Axel Springer
in Germany and Prisa Media in Spain, France’s Le Monde newspaper and the
London-based Financial Times.</p>
<p>Mother Jones and CIR were both founded in the 1970s and merged
earlier this year. Both are based in San Francisco, as is OpenAI.</p>
<p>The lawsuit from CIR, also known for its Reveal podcast and radio
show, outlines the expense of producing investigative journalism and
warns that losing control of copyrighted content will result in less
revenue and even fewer reporters to tell important stories in “today’s
paltry media landscape.”</p>
<p>“With fewer investigative news stories told, the cost to democracy
will be enormous,” the lawsuit says.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-kwins-performance-on-old-hardware">Fixing KWin’s
performance on old hardware</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>KWin had a very long standing bug report about bad performance of the
Wayland session on older Intel integrated graphics. There have been many
investigations into what’s causing this, with a lot of more specific
performance issues being found and fixed, but none of them managed to
fully fix the issue… until now. ↫ Xaver Hugl An excellent deep dive into
a very annoying problem KWin on Wayland running on older Intel hardware
was facing. It turns out the issue was related to display timings, and
older Intel hardware simply not being powerful enough to render frames
within the timing window. The solution consisted of a various smaller
solutions, and one bigger one: triple-buffering. The end result is a
massive performance improvement for KWin on Wayland on older Intel
hardware. This detailed post underlines just how difficult it is to
simply render a bunch of windows and UI elements on time, without
stutters or tearing, while taking into account the wide variety of
hardware a project like KDE Plasma intends to run on. It’s great to see
them paying attention to the older, less powerful systems too, instead
of only focusing on the latest and greatest like Apple, and recently
Microsoft as well, do.</p>

maritime aggression seen as test of US-Philippine alliance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>manila, Philippines — Analysts see China’s increasingly aggressive
attacks on Philippine vessels in the South China Sea as a test of the
U.S.-Philippines alliance. What happens next, they say, will depend
largely on how Manila and Washington respond. </p>
<p>Dramatic footage released last week by the Philippine military showed
Chinese coast guard personnel wielding knives, an ax and other weapons
as they intercepted Philippine soldiers who were in rubber boats
delivering supplies to a garrison at Second Thomas Shoal.  </p>
<p>The June 17 clash was the worst so far in the escalating tension in
the disputed waters, with several Philippine soldiers injured, including
one who lost a thumb, according to Manila. </p>
<p>But while the Philippines tried to de-escalate the tension with
diplomacy, analysts say future such incidents are likely.  </p>
<p>“China will seek to push the Philippines further,” said Don McLain
Gill, an international studies lecturer at De La Salle University in
Manila.  </p>
<p>“The main challenge here is to apply considerable cost on China in
order for it not to illustrate this sort of behavior and turn it into
something regular, like the same way it had regularized water canonning
and ramming [of Philippine vessels],” he told VOA. </p>
<p>There have been several incidents in the past months in which Chinese
coast guard ships blasted Philippine patrol boats with water cannons and
performed dangerous maneuvers in attempts to stop resupply missions to
Philippine troops stationed at the shoal. </p>
<p>The flash point of the conflict is the BRP Sierra Madre, a
dilapidated warship that Manila deliberately ran aground in 1999 to
stake its claim to Second Thomas Shoal, a maritime feature in the
Spratly Islands that is within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone.
 </p>
<p>China claims almost the entirety of the South China Sea, including
the Spratly chain, based on historical maps that an international
tribunal has ruled have no legal basis.</p>
<p>Parallel strand of negotiation</p>
<p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., in his first media
interview since the incident, acknowledged Thursday that more must be
done than to just file diplomatic protests against China. </p>
<p>“We have [lodged] more than 100 protests already. … [What usually
happens is] we summon the ambassador, we tell him our position, that we
don’t want what happened, and that’s it. But we have to do more than
that, so we are. We are doing more than just that,” Marcos told
reporters Thursday, without elaborating. </p>
<p>But Collin Koh, a fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International
Studies in Singapore, said there must also be a “parallel strand of
negotiation and dialogue” between China and the United States to
de-escalate the tension. </p>
<p>The United States is a treaty ally of the Philippines and is
obligated to defend Manila against external armed attack, including in
areas in the South China Sea. </p>
<p>Given the high stakes for all three countries, Koh said, China might
listen to another superpower.  </p>
<p>“I think in large part it will depend very greatly on U.S. signaling
explicitly to China on things that it should refrain from doing, and it
must come with a very explicit threat of repercussions or consequences,”
Koh told VOA. </p>
<p>“If the messaging isn’t done clearly, then we are going to see a
repetition of what’s happening,” he added. </p>
<p>Mutual defense treaty </p>
<p>Marcos has ruled out invoking the mutual defense treaty over the
latest incident, saying it could not be considered an “armed
attack.” </p>
<p>Marcos had earlier said he wanted a review of the treaty, which was
signed in 1951, to respond to the changing security challenges in the
region.  </p>
<p>The recent escalation might provide urgency for Washington and Manila
“to expedite the process of defining particular provisions and enhancing
consultations,” according to Gill of De La Salle University. </p>
<p>One such clarification was provided earlier this year by Marcos, who
said the death of a Philippine serviceman in “an attack or an aggressive
action by another foreign power” could trigger the treaty.  </p>
<p>This specific requirement, however, might work in China’s favor.</p>
<p>“If you set the bar so high, then it means that you are allowing
China to keep doing whatever it is doing just under that threshold,” Koh
said, although he agreed that it was not yet necessary to activate the
treaty.  </p>
<p>“Nobody died and there were no other serious injuries other than the
poor guy who lost his thumb. The question is: Are we going to be lucky
in the future like that?” Koh asked.</p>

2023 fires spewed more heat-trapping gas than millions of cars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Catastrophic Canadian wildfires last year pumped more
heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air than India did by burning
fossil fuels, setting ablaze an area of forest larger than the U.S.
state of West Virginia, new research finds.</p>
<p>Scientists at the World Resources Institute and the University of
Maryland calculated how devastating the impacts were of the monthslong
fires in Canada in 2023 that sullied the air around large parts of the
globe. They figured it put 2.98 billion metric tons of heat-trapping
carbon dioxide into the air, according to a study update published in
Thursday’s Global Change Biology. The update is not peer-reviewed, but
the original study was.</p>
<p>The fire spewed nearly four times the carbon emissions as airplanes
do in a year, study authors said. It’s about the same amount of carbon
dioxide that 647 million cars put in the air in a year, based on U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency data.</p>
<p>Forests “remove a lot of carbon from the atmosphere and that gets
stored in their branches, their trunks, their leaves and kind of in the
ground as well. So, when they burn all the carbon that’s stored within
them, [it] gets released back into the atmosphere,” said the study’s
lead author, James MacCarthy, a research associate with WRI’s Global
Forest Watch.</p>
<p>When and if trees grow back, much of that can be recovered, MacCarthy
said, adding, “It definitely does have an impact on the global scale in
terms of the amount of emissions that were produced in 2023.”</p>
<p>MacCarthy and colleagues calculated that the forest burned totaled
77,574 square kilometers (29,951 square miles), which is six times more
than the average from 2001 to 2022. The wildfires in Canada made up 27%
of global tree cover loss last year; usually it’s closer to 6%,
MacCarthy’s figures show.</p>
<p>These are far more than regular forest fires, but researchers focused
only on tree cover loss, which is a bigger effect, said study co-author
Alexandra Tyukavina, a geography professor at the University of
Maryland.</p>
<p>Syracuse University geography and environment professor Jacob Bendix,
who wasn’t part of the study, said, “The loss of that much forest is a
very big deal, and very worrisome.</p>
<p>“Although the forest will eventually grow back and sequester carbon
in doing so, that is a process that will take decades at a minimum, so
that there is a quite substantial lag between addition of atmospheric
carbon due to wildfire and the eventual removal of at least some of it
by the regrowing forest,” he said.</p>
<p>“So, over the course of those decades, the net impact of the fires is
a contribution to climate warming.”</p>
<p>It’s more than just adding to heat-trapping gases and losing forests;
there were health consequences as well, Tyukavina said.</p>
<p>“Because of these catastrophic fires, air quality in populated areas
and cities was affected last year,” she said, mentioning New York City’s
smog-choked summer. More than 200 communities with about 232,000
residents had to be evacuated, according to another not-yet-published or
peer-reviewed study by Canadian forest and fire experts.</p>
<p>One of the authors of the Canadian study, fire expert Mike Flannigan
at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops, British Columbia, puts the
acreage burned at twice what MacCarthy and Tyukavina do.</p>
<p>“The 2023 fire season in Canada was [an] exceptional year in any time
period,” Flannigan, who wasn’t part of the WRI study, said in an email.
“I expect more fire in our future, but years like 2023 will be
rare.”</p>
<p>Flannigan, Bendix, Tyukavina and MacCarthy all said climate change
played a role in Canada’s big burn. A warmer world means a longer fire
season, more lightning-caused fires and especially drier wood and brush
to catch fire “associated with increased temperature,” Flannigan
wrote.</p>
<p>The average May-to-October temperature in Canada last year was almost
2.2 degrees Celsius warmer than normal, his study found. Some parts of
Canada were 8 to 10 degrees Celsius hotter than average in May and June,
MaCarthy said.</p>
<p>There’s short-term variability within trends, so it’s hard to blame
one specific year and area on climate change, and geographic factors
play a role, Bendix said in an email, but still, “there is no doubt that
climate change is the principal driver of the global increases in
wildfire.”</p>
<p>With the world warming from climate change, Tyukavina said, “The
catastrophic years are probably going to be happening more often, and we
are going to see those spikier years more often.”</p>

<h2 id="us-denies-zimbabwes-claims-it-is-militarizing-zambia">US denies
Zimbabwe’s claims it is militarizing Zambia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HARARE, ZIMBABWE — The head of U.S. Africa Command denied Thursday
claims by Zimbabwean government officials that Washington is setting up
a military base in neighboring Zambia and wants to move AFRICOM
operations there from Germany.</p>
<p>At an online press briefing, General Michael Langley, head of
AFRICOM, rejected Zimbabwe’s claims that the United States is
establishing a base in neighboring Zambia.</p>
<p>“That’s absolutely false,” Langley said from an African Chiefs of
Defense Conference in Botswana. “We have no bases in Zambia. We have no
plans to put one there.”</p>
<p>He said the U.S.’s approach on the continent is “African-led and
U.S.-enabled.”</p>
<p>“We have a deep partnership with Zambia,” he said. “We have increased
security cooperation with them. But there is no footprint. There’s no
posture. There’s no base.”</p>
<p>Zimbabwean officials declined to comment to VOA about Langley’s
remarks. But Rutendo Matinyarare, chairperson of the pro-government
Zimbabwe Anti-Sanctions Movement, alleged that Langley held a briefing
in Lusaka and that the U.S. was setting up the AFRICOM hub in
Zambia.</p>
<p>Matinyarare claimed that several businesspeople who have flown into
the country have seen a substantial amount of American military
equipment at Zambia’s airport.</p>
<p>“And so, the question is, ‘What are these weapons doing in Zambia?’”
he said.</p>
<p>Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema denies that his country is being
militarized by the U.S. He says Zambia’s army has exchange programs with
a number of countries, including the U.S., which should not be mistaken
for the U.S. establishing a base.</p>
<p>Zambia says it has called on two regional bodies — the African Union
and the Southern African Development Community — to mediate talks with
Zimbabwe. Zambia and Zimbabwe are members of both organizations.</p>
<p>Zambian officials have also said the fallout stems from comments that
Zimbabwean President Emerson Mnangagwa made during a recent trip to
Russia — namely, the accusation that the U.S. has been militarizing
Zambia to consolidate power in the region and isolate Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>Western countries imposed travel and financial sanctions on
Zimbabwe’s leadership and affiliated companies in the early 2000s for
alleged election rigging and human rights abuses. The U.S. recently
removed sanctions on most Zimbabweans, but a few prominent figures —
including Mnangagwa — remain on the list.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Langley told reporters that top regional security
challenges throughout Africa were discussed at the just-ended defense
conference.</p>
<p>“Our African partners want this conference here because they want to
own it. But we are AFRICOM, and the U.S. government is here because we
have common values, common objectives, that will affect stability,
security and prosperity on the continent,” he said.</p>
<p>This year’s conference provided a “valuable wealth of information”
and lessons ahead of talks next year, Langley said.</p>

<h2 id="will-this-be-the-hottest-presidential-debate-ever">Will This Be
the Hottest Presidential Debate Ever?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUwODk4Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzY0MTkyNn0.pbW1q2DycZVdPmnamScWJ0gpGEcEXvnlhTE8aOk0KCY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
In spite of a deadly heat wave that has seen temperatures touch 100
degrees Fahrenheit and a first-ever summer date, today’s presidential
debate in Atlanta won’t even come close to being the hottest ever.
Temperatures will reach 84 degrees this afternoon and are forecasted to
settle around 80 degrees by the time the debate begins at 9 p.m.
Eastern.
</p>
<p>
This is the first presidential debate not to be held in September or
October, when most American cities have started to cool down. And of the
cities that have hosted debates, just four are further south Atlanta.
Yet this is just the eighth-hottest debate in history.
</p>
<center>
<iframe aria-label="Scatter Plot" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="466" id="datawrapper-chart-D1plG" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/D1plG/8/" style="border: none;" title="Debate-day highs over the years" width="680">
</iframe>
</center>
<p>
The story would’ve been different if the debate had been held in any of
the past six days. Thermometers in Atlanta have hit 93 degrees all week
— which would’ve made this debate the hottest ever.
</p>
<p>
Even more remarkably, there have been <em><em>three</em></em> previous
debates on days when temperatures surpassed 90 degrees.
</p>
<p>
The high of 92 degrees the day of the third presidential debate in 2004
between then-President George W. Bush and his Democratic challenger John
Kerry was ordinary for a mid-October day in Tempe, Arizona, where the
debate was held. There, temperatures regularly reach into the 90s late
into the month.
</p>
<p>
But the September 21, 1980 presidential debate in Baltimore between
insurgent Republican nominee Ronald Reagan and Independent John B.
Anderson (Democrat Jimmy Carter, the incumbent, declined the invitation)
saw temperatures soar about 14 degrees higher than average, reaching 90
degrees. And in San Francisco on October 6, 1976, the thermometer also
hit 90 degrees — more than 20 degrees above the average for the city at
that time of year.
</p>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p>
<p>
On average, debate-day high temperatures have been trending higher in
recent years. But in truth, there aren’t many conclusions to be drawn
from that metric. Temperatures can vary widely from day to day, and this
will be only the 36th general-election presidential debate since
then-candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon faced off for the
first time on national television in 1960. That doesn’t give us a huge
data set to work with.

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Of the four cities that have hosted 90 degree debates, temperature
variability is especially pronounced in Baltimore, where at least 23
days out of the past year have been 10 degrees hotter or cooler than the
day before. The figure is lower but still pronounced for Atlanta, San
Francisco, and Tempe, underscoring the difficulty of drawing reliable
conclusions on the trajectory of debate-day forecasts. <br/>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
Plus, every debate has been held in the evening, after heat has subsided
for the day. On that scorching day in San Francisco, for instance,
temperatures had fallen to the 70s by the time Carter and then-President
Gerald Ford were making their opening statements.
</p>
<p>
But even if presidential debates go back to their usual early autumn
time slot, we might still see a rise in debate temperatures as the
seasons themselves change. One 2021
<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL091753" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a>
found that climate change had increased the length of summer by 17 days
from 1952 to 2011, while spring, autumn, and winter all lost days. By
2100, summer could last up to half the year, the study found.

<p>Washington — Geopolitical tensions and growing competition in tech

<p>The United States remains the top choice for Chinese students seeking

universities during the 2022-2023 school year. But reports of some cases
that students and professors are facing extra scrutiny while passing
through immigration and the deportation of others are raising
concerns.</p>
<p>For Chen Xiaojin, a doctoral student studying semiconductor materials
at a university in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, it has been
six years since she returned to her hometown of Beijing.</p>
<p>At first, it was the COVID-19 pandemic that kept her from going home.
But over the past two years, she has been deterred by accounts of
Chinese students majoring in science and engineering being required to
reapply for their visas upon returning to China.</p>
<p>She also says she is worried by reports over the past six months of
Chinese students being deported, even at nearby Dulles Airport.</p>
<p>“My current research is relatively sensitive, and my boss [adviser]
is getting funds from the U.S. Department of Defense, making it even
more sensitive,” she told VOA. “I am afraid that I won’t be able to
return after I go back [to China].”</p>
<p>Chen says that if she did return to China, she would have to apply
for a new visa.</p>
<p>In a report late last month, Bloomberg said it had found at least 20
Chinese students and scholars with valid visas who were deported at U.S.
Customs since November and barred from reentry. The U.S. Customs and
Border Protection Agency does not release relevant data.</p>
<p>Immigration attorney Dan Berger represented one Chinese student who
was deported late last year. He tells VOA Mandarin that the student
studied biological sciences at Yale University and was about to complete
her doctorate.</p>
<p>She visited her family in China and got a new visa but was deported
by customs at Dulles Airport and barred from reentering the country for
five years. Berger said he did not see anything suspicious in the
transcript of the conversation between the student and the customs
officer.</p>
<p>“We have seen what seems like a pattern over the last six months of
Chinese PhD students being turned around…. more than I’ve seen in quite
a while,” he said.</p>
<p>Matthew Brazil, a fellow at the Jamestown Foundation, said neither
country seems willing to explain the situation. However, he believes
that in most cases, the United States must have valid reasons for
blocking visa holders from entering the country.</p>
<p>In some cases, the student’s background may not match what is written
on the visa application. In other cases, customs agents may also find
something that the State Department missed, and once they see it, they
are responsible for taking action.</p>
<p>“I wish the Chinese side would be specific about their students who
were refused entry,” he said. “The fact that both sides are mum on
details and that the Chinese side is engaged with the usual angry
rhetoric means that each has security concerns. And that says to me that
there was good reason for the U.S. to stop these particular
applicants.”</p>
<p>Brazil also sees a connection between the entry denials and export
control regulations issued by the United States in October 2022 that
restrict China’s ability to obtain advanced computing chips, develop and
maintain supercomputers, and manufacture advanced semiconductors.</p>
<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection is one of the law enforcement
agencies authorized to investigate violations of export control
regulations, he said.</p>
<p>“Beijing’s intelligence agencies are known to focus attention on PRC
[People’s Republic of China] students and scientists headed abroad who
study or work on dual-use technologies controlled under the Export
Administration Act — compelling Chinese students and scientists to
report on what they’ve learned when they return to China on holiday,” he
said. “This has been true for decades.”</p>
<p>Bill Drexel, a fellow for the Technology and National Security
Program at the Center for a New American Security, said the U.S.
government did find some cases where students tried to steal strategic
technology for China.</p>
<p>“I think it would both not be surprising that they found some really
questionable or incriminating evidence for some students,” he said. “It
would also not be surprising if, in their hunt for really solid
evidence, they also may have made some mistakes on other students.”</p>
<p>Drexel adds that “it’s just kind of an unfortunate fact of the time
that we live in and the tactics that the CCP uses when it comes to these
measures.”</p>
<p>In a post on X in early May, U.S. ambassador to China Nicholas Burns
tried to dispel concerns about visas and entry to the United States for
students and scholars. In the post, he said “99.9% of Chinese students
holding visas encounter no issues upon entering the United States.”</p>
<p>In an interview with The Wall Street Journal Monday, Burns said it is
China that is making it impossible to promote people-to-people ties.
Burns told the Journal that students attending events sponsored by the
United States in China have been interrogated and intimidated.</p>
<p>He also said that since U.S. President Joe Biden and China’s leader
Xi Jinping held their summit in San Francisco last year, China’s
Ministry of State Security and other agencies had interfered with
Chinese citizens’ participation at some 61 events.</p>
<p>At a regular briefing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning dismissed those accusations, saying that they did
not “reflect reality” and that went against key understandings reached
by both countries’ presidents in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“The United States, under the pretext of ‘national security,’
unjustifiably harasses, interrogates, and deports Chinese students in
the U.S., causing them significant harm and creating a severe chilling
effect,” Mao said. “The image of the United States in the minds of the
Chinese people fundamentally depends on the actions of the United States
itself.”</p>
<p>Drexel said he believes Burns’ comments about visas and students’
willingness to study in the U.S. still ring true.</p>
<p>“On balance, it’s still the case that American universities are
overwhelmingly warm towards Chinese students and want them in large
numbers,” he said.</p>
<p>However, Berger, the immigration lawyer, is concerned about the
chilling effect recent cases involving Chinese students could have.</p>
<p>“In general, we are being more careful about advising Chinese
graduate students in STEM fields about traveling and letting them know
that there is some small risk,” he said.</p>
<p>Even though the risk is small, it does seem to be real at the moment,
he said.</p>

<h2 id="ferc-says-yes-to-the-lng-terminal">FERC Says Yes to the LNG
Terminal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUxMTUyNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjIzNTU2NH0.bHFtHzEuq57UYvGvjJ2cljSt__QXAi3IWiq02KhmcOM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The Department of Energy may not be ready to say yes to more liquified
natural gas export projects, but the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission is. In a meeting on Thursday, FERC approved plans for a
massive LNG terminal project in Louisiana by a 2-1 vote, with Allison
Clements, an outgoing Democratic commissioner, as the lone dissenter.
</p>
<p>
The Calcasieu Pass 2, or CP2, project would install some 20 million
metric tons of export capacity in a hurricane-battered coastal Louisiana
community near the Texas border. You may have heard of it if you
followed the drama in January around the Biden administration’s decision
to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-lng-exports-pause-young-voters-climate" rel="noopener" target="_self">pause</a>
approving new LNG export terminals, which will allow the DOE to
reexamine how it assesses whether new energy projects are in the “public
interest.”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/house-lng-hearing-ukraine-emissions" target="_blank">Republicans
haven’t stopped talking about it since</a>, arguing that the pause
chokes off a major American export and that it both was tantamount to a
fossil fuel ban and that it undermined the administration’s climate
goals. Democrats — especially those running for reelection in swing
states — have been lukewarm.
</p>
<p>
CP2 has enjoyed
<a href="https://venturegloballng.com/press/venture-global-and-louisiana-governor-john-bel-edwards-announce-proposed-cp2-lng-export-facility/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bipartisan
political support</u></a> within Louisiana but became a target for
national and local environmental groups who want the Biden
administration to do more to prevent the development of new fossil fuel
resources. These groups argued that CP2 would both
“<a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2023/12/11/cp2-lng/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lock
in</a>” substantial greenhouse gas emissions from the extraction and
transport of natural gas (one former Environmental Protection Agency
official called it a “carbon mega bomb”) and have deleterious
environmental effects on an area that’s already heavily industrialized.
</p>
<p>
“Venture Global is a bad actor in the energy space and FERC is enabling
them to start another disastrous project that puts polluters over
people,” the Sierra Club’s Cathy Collentine said in a statement. “CP2 is
an environmental justice, climate, and economic disaster waiting to
happen, and with this decision, FERC has ignored the harm that will be
caused by CP2 — and gas exports more broadly — and sided with the greedy
fossil fuel industry.”
</p>
<p>
FERC evaluated CP2’s environmental impacts last year and concluded that
they would be “less than significant,” but that the “visual resources”
of the area would see “significant adverse effect” — in other words, it
would be an ugly and permanent addition to the landscape.
</p>
<p>
But final approval has been delayed for months, much to the annoyance of
the industry. FERC released its final environmental impact statement in
July of last year, making the wait for approval one of “the longest to
sit before the commission,” according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. The climate
effect of LNG exports is a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-1-lng" target="_self"><u>matter
of some debate</u></a>, with some researchers arguing that if LNG is
replacing fuels with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/lng-exports-pause-biden-emissions" target="_self"><u>higher
associated emissions</u></a>, it can lead to lower overall global
emissions over time.
</p>
<p>
LNG projects exist in a kind of regulatory Venn diagram. While FERC has
jurisdiction over natural gas pipelines, natural gas exports to
countries that don’t have free trade agreements with the U.S. — which
make up the bulk of the natural gas market — requires DOE approval, and
that’s still in limbo. “No major LNG terminal has ever reached a final
investment decision or started construction without this critical export
authorization,” the Sierra Club noted in its statement.

id="boeing-sanctioned-over-release-of-737-max-investigation-details">Boeing
sanctioned over release of 737 MAX investigation details</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON/SEATTLE — U.S. investigators on Thursday sanctioned Boeing
for revealing details of a probe into a 737 MAX mid-air blowout and said
they would refer its conduct to the Justice Department, prompting the
embattled planemaker to issue an apology.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said Boeing had
“blatantly violated” its rules by providing “non-public investigative
information” and speculating about possible causes of the Jan. 5 Alaska
Airlines ALK.N door-plug emergency during a factory tour attended by
dozens of journalists.</p>
<p>The decision sheds new light on strains between the crisis-hit
planemaker and government agencies at a time when it is trying to avoid
criminal charges being weighed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) ahead
of a July 7 deadline.</p>
<p>“As a party to many NTSB investigations over the past decades, few
entities know the rules better than Boeing,” the NTSB said.</p>
<p>The NTSB said Boeing would keep its status as a party to the
investigation into the Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines emergency but would no
longer see information produced during its probe into the accident,
which involved the mid-air blowout of a door plug with four missing
bolts.</p>
<p>Unlike other parties, Boeing will now not be allowed to ask questions
of other participants at a hearing on August 6-7.</p>
<p>“We deeply regret that some of our comments, intended to make clear
our responsibility in the accident and explain the actions we are
taking, overstepped the NTSB’s role as the source of investigative
information,” Boeing said in a statement.</p>
<p>The NTSB’s criticism revolves around comments made during a media
briefing about quality improvements on Tuesday at the 737 factory near
Seattle - widely seen as part of an exercise to showcase greater
transparency ahead of the Farnborough Airshow.</p>
<p>During the briefing, which was held on Tuesday under an embargo
allowing contents to be published on Thursday, an executive said the
plug had been opened on the assembly line without the correct paperwork
to fix a quality issue with surrounding rivets, and that missing bolts
were not replaced.  </p>
<p>The team that came in and closed the plug was not responsible for
reinstalling the bolts, Elizabeth Lund, Boeing’s senior vice president
of quality, added.</p>
<p>The NTSB said that by providing investigative information and giving
an analysis of information already released, Boeing had contravened its
agreement with the agency.</p>
<p>“Boeing offered opinions and analysis on factors it suggested were
causal to the accident,” it added.</p>
<p>In May, the DOJ said Boeing had violated a 2021 settlement with
prosecutors that shielded it from criminal charges over interactions
with the Federal Aviation Administration prior to MAX crashes in 2018
and 2019 that killed 346 people.</p>
<p>U.S. prosecutors have recommended criminal charges be brought,
Reuters reported on Sunday. The DOJ already has a separate criminal
probe into the door-plug episode.</p>
<p>Thursday’s rare exchange marks the latest sign of strains between
Boeing and the NTSB.  </p>
<p>In 2018, Boeing was widely criticized for issuing a statement
appearing to question the performance of pilots in the first of two
fatal crashes that led to a grounding of the MAX. Later investigations
emphasized the role of flawed software.</p>
<p>In March this year, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy told a U.S. Senate
hearing Boeing had failed to provide names of employees on its 737 MAX
door team for two months, drawing criticism from lawmakers. Boeing then
quickly provided the names.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the NTSB said Boeing had portrayed its investigation of
the Alaska air incident to media as a search to locate the individual
responsible for plug work.</p>
<p>“The NTSB is instead focused on the probable cause of the accident,
not placing blame on any individual or assessing liability,” the agency
said.</p>
<p>Asked during Tuesday’s briefing who had failed to fill in
documentation, Lund said: “There may have been one or more than one
employee. What I will say is the ‘who’ is absolutely in the
responsibility of the NTSB. That investigation is still going on and I
am going to not comment on that right now”.</p>
<p>The role of individuals is a particularly sensitive topic in air
safety amid an increasing focus on litigation and, in some countries, a
trend towards criminalizing air accidents.</p>
<p>Under global rules, agencies carry out civil probes into air
accidents for the sole purpose of finding the cause and making
recommendations to improve safety in future. Such actions are separate
from any judicial probes seeking to attribute blame.</p>
<p>Aviation experts say an 80-year-old international treaty that
encourages people to speak freely and focus on causes rather than blame
allowed the industry to cut the number of accidents dramatically since
the start of the jet age, but depends on curbing any special pleading by
the parties involved.</p>
<p>Critics, including some lawyers, say this system does not
sufficiently take account of the need of the families of victims for
detailed answers.</p>
<p>In 2013, the NTSB barred United Parcel ServiceUPS.N and its pilots
union from an investigation of a crash in Alabama that killed two UPS
pilots.  </p>
<p>In 2018, it removed Tesla as a party to an investigation into a fatal
crash involving a vehicle’s “Autopilot” system. Tesla hit back publicly,
saying it had already decided to withdraw and accusing the NTSB of
violating its own rules.</p>

id="supreme-court-rejects-us-opioid-settlement-with-purdue-pharma">Supreme
Court rejects US opioid settlement with Purdue Pharma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a nationwide
settlement with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that would have shielded
members of the Sackler family who own the company from civil lawsuits
over the toll of opioids but also would have provided billions of
dollars to combat the opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>After deliberating more than six months, the justices in a 5-4 vote
blocked an agreement hammered out with state and local governments and
victims. The Sacklers would have contributed up to $6 billion and given
up ownership of the company but retained billions more. The agreement
provided that the company would emerge from bankruptcy as a different
entity, with its profits used for treatment and prevention.</p>
<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, said “nothing in
present law authorizes the Sackler discharge.”</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh, Elena Kagan
and Sonia Sotomayor dissented.</p>
<p>“Opioid victims and other future victims of mass torts will suffer
greatly in the wake of today’s unfortunate and destabilizing decision,”
Kavanaugh wrote.</p>
<p>The high court had put the settlement on hold last summer, in
response to objections from the Biden administration.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what happens next.</p>
<p>“Today’s Supreme Court ruling marks a major setback for the families
who lost loved ones to overdose and for those still struggling with
addiction,” Edward Neiger, a lawyer representing more than 60,000
overdose victims, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The Purdue plan was a victim-centered plan that would provide
billions of dollars to the states to be used exclusively to abate the
opioid crisis and $750 million for victims of the crisis, so that they
could begin to rebuild their lives. As a result of the senseless
three-year crusade by the government against the plan, thousands of
people died of overdose, and today’s decision will lead to more needless
overdose deaths.”</p>
<p>An opponent of the settlement praised the outcome.</p>
<p>Ed Bisch’s 18-year-old son Eddie, died from an overdose after taking
OxyContin in Philadelphia in 2001.</p>
<p>The older Bisch, who lives in New Jersey, has been speaking out
against Purdue and Sackler family members ever since and is part of a
relatively small but vocal group of victims and family members who
opposed the settlement.</p>
<p>“This is a step toward justice. It was outrageous what they were
trying to get away with,” he said Thursday. “They have made a mockery of
the justice system and then they tried to make a mockery of the
bankruptcy system.”</p>
<p>He said he would have accepted the deal if he thought it would have
made a dent in the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>He’s now calling on the Department of Justice to seek criminal
charges against Sackler family members</p>
<p>Arguments in early December lasted nearly two hours in a packed
courtroom as the justices seemed, by turns, unwilling to disrupt a
carefully negotiated settlement and reluctant to reward the
Sacklers.</p>
<p>The issue for the justices was whether the legal shield that
bankruptcy provides can be extended to people such as the Sacklers, who
have not declared bankruptcy themselves. Lower courts had issued
conflicting decisions over that issue, which also has implications for
other major product liability lawsuits settled through the bankruptcy
system.</p>
<p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee, an arm of the Justice Department, argued
that the bankruptcy law does not permit protecting the Sackler family
from being sued. During the Trump administration, the government
supported the settlement.</p>
<p>The Biden administration had argued to the court that negotiations
could resume, and perhaps lead to a better deal, if the court were to
stop the current agreement.</p>
<p>Proponents of the plan said third-party releases are sometimes
necessary to forge an agreement, and federal law imposes no prohibition
against them.</p>
<p>OxyContin first hit the market in 1996, and Purdue Pharma’s
aggressive marketing of it is often cited as a catalyst of the
nationwide opioid epidemic, with doctors persuaded to prescribe
painkillers with less regard for addiction dangers.</p>
<p>The drug and the Stamford, Connecticut-based company became
synonymous with the crisis, even though the majority of pills being
prescribed and used were generic drugs. Opioid-related overdose deaths
have continued to climb, hitting 80,000 in recent years. Most of those
are from fentanyl and other synthetic drugs.</p>
<p>The Purdue Pharma settlement would have ranked among the largest
reached by drug companies, wholesalers and pharmacies to resolve
epidemic-related lawsuits filed by state, local and Native American
tribal governments and others. Those settlements have totaled more than
$50 billion.</p>
<p>But the Purdue Pharma settlement would have been only the second so
far to include direct payments to victims from a $750 million pool.
Payouts would have ranged from about $3,500 to $48,000.</p>
<p>Sackler family members no longer are on the company’s board, and they
have not received payouts from it since before Purdue Pharma entered
bankruptcy. In the decade before that, though, they were paid more than
$10 billion, about half of which family members said went to pay
taxes.</p>

It seems to me that this particular problem can be solved if the

This will not solve all problems with returning by reference, but it

id="supreme-court-halts-enforcement-of-the-epas-plan-to-limit-downwind-pollution-from-power-plants">Supreme
Court halts enforcement of the EPA’s plan to limit downwind pollution
from power plants</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is putting the Environmental
Protection Agency’s air pollution-fighting “good neighbor” plan on hold
while legal challenges continue, the conservative-led court’s latest
blow to federal regulations.</p>
<p>The justices in a 5-4 vote on Thursday rejected arguments by the
Biden administration and Democratic-controlled states that the plan was
cutting air pollution and saving lives in 11 states where it was being
enforced and that the high court’s intervention was unwarranted.</p>
<p>The rule is intended to restrict smokestack emissions from power
plants and other industrial sources that burden downwind areas with
smog-causing pollution. It will remain on hold while the federal appeals
court in Washington considers a challenge to the plan from industry and
Republican-led states.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly
reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent
years. The justices have restricted the EPA’s authority to fight air and
water pollution — including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited the
EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants
that contribute to global warming. The court also shot down a vaccine
mandate and blocked President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness
program.</p>
<p>The court is currently weighing whether to overturn its 40-year-old
Chevron decision, which has been the basis for upholding a wide range of
regulations on public health, workplace safety and consumer
protections.</p>
<p>Three energy-producing states — Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia —
have challenged the air pollution rule, along with the steel industry
and other groups, calling it costly and ineffective. They had asked the
high court to put it on hold while their challenge makes it way through
the courts.</p>
<p>The challengers pointed to decisions in courts around the country
that have paused the rule in a dozen states, arguing that those
decisions have undermined the EPA’s aim of providing a national solution
to the problem of ozone pollution because the agency relied on the
assumption that all 23 states targeted by the rule would
participate.</p>
<p>The issue came to the court on an emergency basis, which almost
always results in an order from the court without arguments before the
justices.</p>
<p>But not this time. The court heard arguments in late February, when a
majority of the court seemed skeptical of arguments from the
administration and New York, representing Democratic states, that the
“good neighbor” rule was important to protect downwind states that
receive unwanted air pollution from other states.</p>
<p>The EPA has said power plant emissions dropped by 18% last year in
the 10 states where it has been allowed to enforce its rule, which was
finalized a year ago. Those states are Illinois, Indiana, Maryland,
Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and
Wisconsin. In California, limits on emissions from industrial sources
other than power plants are supposed to take effect in 2026.</p>
<p>The rule is on hold in another dozen states because of separate legal
challenges. Those states are Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West
Virginia.</p>
<p>States that contribute to ground-level ozone, or smog, are required
to submit plans ensuring that coal-fired power plants and other
industrial sites don’t add significantly to air pollution in other
states. In cases in which a state has not submitted a “good neighbor”
plan — or in which the EPA disapproves a state plan — the federal plan
was supposed to ensure that downwind states are protected.</p>
<p>Ground-level ozone, which forms when industrial pollutants chemically
react in the presence of sunlight, can cause respiratory problems,
including asthma and chronic bronchitis. People with compromised immune
systems, the elderly and children playing outdoors are particularly
vulnerable.</p>

<h2 id="carbon-removals-existential-question">Carbon Removal’s
Existential Question</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ2NTIzMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNzk0MzYxOX0.Bcg_DnKquj1RJlM5lx6cZ8OXatN2u8Vf6AmGTF1YqKc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Carbon removal would seem to have a pretty clear definition. It’s the
reverse of carbon emissions. It means taking carbon out of the
atmosphere and putting it somewhere else — underground, into products,
into the ocean — where it won’t warm the planet. But a new kind of
carbon removal project shows how this formula can conceal consequential
differences between approaches.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A few months ago, Puro.earth, a carbon removal registry, certified a
small ethanol refinery in North Dakota to sell carbon removal credits —
the first ethanol plant to earn this privilege. Red Trail Energy, which
owns the facility, captures the CO2 released from the plant when corn is
fermented into ethanol, and injects it into a porous section of rock
more than 6,000 feet underground. Since Red Trail started doing this in
June of 2022, it’s prevented some 300,000 metric tons of CO2 from
entering the atmosphere, according to
<a href="https://www.dmr.nd.gov/dmr/oilgas/ClassVI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a>
published by the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to look at what’s happening here.
</p>
<p>
If you just follow the carbon, it started in the atmosphere and ended up
underground. In between, the corn sucked up carbon through
photosynthesis; when it was processed into ethanol, about a third of
that carbon went into the fuel, a third was left behind as dried grain,
and the remainder was captured as it wafted out of the fermentation tank
and stashed underground. “That is, in a broad sense, how that looks like
carbon removal,” Daniel Sanchez, an assistant professor at the
University of California, Berkeley who studies biomass carbon removal,
told me.
</p>
<p>
But if you zoom out, the picture changes. For the carbon to get from the
atmosphere to the ground, a few other things had to happen. The corn had
to be grown, harvested, and transported in trucks to the plant. It had
to be put through a mill, cooked, and then liquified using heat from a
natural gas boiler. And this was all in service, first and foremost, of
producing ethanol to be burned, ultimately, in a car engine. If you
account for the CO2 emitted during these other steps, the process as a
whole is putting more into the atmosphere than it’s taking out.
</p>
<p>
So, is Red Trail Energy really doing carbon removal?
</p>
<p>
Puro.earth takes the first view — the registry’s rules essentially draw
a box around the carbon capture and storage, or CCS, part of the
process. Red Trail has to count the emissions from the energy it took to
capture and liquify and inject the carbon, but not from anything else
that happened before that. So far, Puro has issued just over 157,000
carbon removal credits for Red Trail to sell.
</p>
<p>
This is, essentially, industry consensus. Other carbon market registries
including Gold Standard, Verra, and Isometric more or less take the same
approach for any projects involving biomass, though they haven’t
certified any ethanol projects yet. (Isometric’s current rules
disqualify ethanol plants because they only allow projects that use
waste biomass.)
</p>
<p>
But the nonprofit CarbonPlan, a watchdog for the carbon removal
industry, argues that it’s a mistake to call this carbon removal. In a
<a href="https://carbonplan.org/research/ethanol-cdr-claims" target="_blank">blog
post</a> published in December, program lead Freya Chay wrote that
because the carbon storage is “contingent upon the continued production
of ethanol,” it’s wrong to separate the two processes. The project
<em><em>reduces</em></em> the facility’s overall emissions, Chay argued,
but it’s not “carbon removal.”
</p>
<p>
This debate may sound semantic, and to some extent, it is. As long as an
action results in less pollution warming the planet, does it matter
whether we label it “carbon removal” or “emission reduction”?
</p>
<p>
The point of carbon credits is that they are paying for an intervention
that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. “You have to look at, what part
of the project is being built because they receive carbon removal
credits?” Marianne Tikkanen, the co-founder and head of standard at Puro
told me. “In this case, it was the capture part.” Previously, the
emissions from the fermentation tank were considered to be zero, since
the carbon started in the atmosphere and ended up back in the
atmosphere. If you just look at the change that the sale of credits
supported, those emissions are now negative.
</p>
<p>
But the logic of carbon credits may not be totally aligned with the
point of carbon <em><em>removal.</em></em> Scientists generally see
three roles for technologies that remove carbon from the atmosphere. The
first is to reduce net emissions in the near term — Red Trail’s project
checks that box. In the medium term, carbon removal can counteract any
remaining emissions that we don’t know how to eliminate. That’s how
we’ll “achieve net-zero” and stop the planet from warming.
</p>
<p>
But those who say these labels really matter are thinking of the third
role. In the distant future, if we achieve net-zero emissions, but
global average temperatures have reached dangerous heights, doing
additional carbon removal — and lowering the total concentration of CO2
in the atmosphere — will be our only hope of cooling the planet. If this
is the long term goal, there is a “clear conceptual problem” with
calling a holistic process that emits more than it removes “carbon
removal,” Chay told me.
</p>
<p>
“I think the point of definitions is to help us navigate the world,” she
said. “It will be kind of a miracle if we get there, but that is the
lighthouse.”
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Red Trail may have been the first ethanol company to get certified to
sell carbon removal credits, but others are looking to follow in its
footsteps. Chay’s blog post, written in December, was responding to news
of another project: Summit Carbon Solutions, a company trying to build a
major pipeline through the midwest that will transport CO2 captured from
ethanol refineries and deliver it to an underground well in North
Dakota,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/carbon-credit-deal-targets-us-pipeline-to-remove-corn-based-ethanol-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced
a deal</u></a> to pre-sell $30 million worth of carbon removal credits
from the project; it plans to
<a href="https://www.goldstandard.org/news/first-carbon-dioxide-removal-and-storage-methodolo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>certify
the credits through Gold Standard</u></a>. In May, Summit
<a href="https://summitcarbonsolutions.com/anew-climate-summit-carbon-solutions-advance-megaton-co2-removal-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
it planned to sell more than 160 million tons of carbon removal credits
over the next decade.
</p>
<p>
Decarbonization experts often refer to the emissions from ethanol plants
as low-hanging fruit. Out of all the polluting industries that we could
be capturing carbon from, ethanol is one of the easiest. The CO2
released when corn sugar is fermented is nearly 100% pure, whereas the
CO2 that comes from fossil fuel combustion is filled with all kinds of
chemicals that need to be scrubbed out first.
</p>
<p>
Even if it’s relatively easy, though, it’s not free, and the ethanol
industry has historically ignored the opportunity. But in the past few
years, federal tax credits and carbon markets have made the idea more
attractive.
</p>
<p>
Red Trail’s CCS project has been a long time in the making. The company
began looking into CCS in 2016, partnering with the Energy and
Environmental Research Center, the North Dakota Industrial Commission
Renewable Energy Council, and the U.S. Department of Energy on a
five-year feasibility study. Jodi Johnson, Red Trail’s CEO, answered
questions about the project by email. “Building a first-of-its-kind CCS
project involved significant financial, technical, and regulatory
risks,” she told me. “The technology, while promising, required
substantial upfront investment and a commitment to navigating uncharted
regulatory frameworks.”
</p>
<p>
The primary motivation for the project was the company’s “commitment to
environmental stewardship and sustainability,” Johnson said, but
low-carbon fuel markets in California and Oregon were also a “strategic
incentive.” Ethanol companies that sell into those states earn carbon
credits based on how much cleaner their fuel is than gasoline. They can
sell those credits to dirtier-fuel makers who need to comply with state
laws. The carbon capture project would enable Red Trail to earn more
credits — a revenue stream that at first, looked good enough to justify
the cost. A
<a href="https://undeerc.org/research/projects/_files/docs/integrated-cc-storage-for-ethanol-production.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2017
economic assessment</u></a> of the project found that it “may be
economically viable,” depending on the specific requirements in the two
states.
</p>
<p>
But today, two years after Red Trail began capturing carbon, the
company’s application to participate in California’s low-carbon fuel
market is still pending. Though the company does sell some ethanol into
the Oregon market, it decided to try and sell carbon removal credits
through Puro to support “broader decarbonization and sequestration
efforts while awaiting regulatory approvals,” Johnson said. Red Trail
had already built its carbon capture system prior to working with Puro,
but it may not have operated the equipment unless it had an incentive to
do so.
</p>
<p>
Puro didn’t just take Red Trail’s word for it. The project underwent a
“financial additionality test” including an evaluation of other
incentives for Red Trail to sequester carbon. For example, the company
can earn up to $50 in tax credits for each ton of CO2 it puts
underground. (The Inflation Reduction Act increased this subsidy to $85
per ton, but Red Trail is not eligible for the higher amount because it
started building the project before the law went into effect.) In
theory, this tax credit alone could be enough to finance the project. A
recent
<a href="https://efifoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/20230212-CCS-Final_Full-copy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a>
from the Energy Futures Initiative concluded that a first-of-a-kind CCS
project at an ethanol plant should cost between $36 and $41 per ton of
CO2 captured and stored.
</p>
<p>
Johnson told me Red Trail does not pay income tax at the corporate
level, however — it is taxed as a partnership. That means individual
investors can take advantage of the credit, but it’s not a big enough
benefit to secure project finance. The project “requires significant
capital expenditure, operating expense, regulatory, and long-term
monitoring for compliance,” she said. “Access to the carbon market was
the needed incentive to secure the investment and the continuous project
operation.”
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, after an independent audit of Red Trail’s claims, Puro
concluded that the company did, in fact, need to sell carbon removal
credits to justify operating the CCS project. (Red Trail is currently
also earning carbon credits for fuel sold in Oregon, but Puro is
accounting for these and deducting credits from its registry
accordingly.)
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
All this helps make the case that it’s reasonable to support projects
like Red Trail’s through the sale of carbon credits. But it doesn’t
explain why we should call it carbon removal.
</p>
<p>
When I put the question to Tikkanen, she said that the project
interrupts the “short cycle” of carbon: The CO2 is captured during
photosynthesis, it’s transferred into food or fuel, and then it’s
released back into the air in a continuous loop — all in a matter of
months. Red Trail is turning that loop into a one-way street from the
atmosphere to the ground, taking more and more carbon out of the air
over time. That’s different from capturing carbon at a fossil fuel
plant, where the carbon in question had previously been trapped
underground for millennia.
</p>
<p>
Robert Hoglund, a carbon removal advisor who co-founded the database
CDR.fyi, had a similar explanation. He told me that it didn’t make sense
to categorize this project as “reducing emissions” from the plant
because the fossil fuel-burning trucks that deliver the corn and the
natural gas boilers cooking it are still releasing the same amount of
carbon into the atmosphere. “If we say only processes that, if they’re
scaled up, lead to lower emissions in the atmosphere are carbon removal,
that’s looking at it from a system perspective,” he said. “I can
understand where they come from, but I think it does add some
confusion.”
</p>
<p>
Red Trail Energy and Summit Carbon Solutions defended the label, noting
that this is the way carbon market registries have decided to treat
biomass-based carbon sequestration projects. “The fact that emissions
remain from the lifecycle of the corn itself is not the focus of the
removal activity,” Johnson told me. “The biogenic CO2 is clearly removed
from the atmosphere permanently.”
</p>
<p>
Sanchez, the Berkeley professor, argued that Puro’s rules are adequate
because there’s a path for ethanol plants to eventually achieve
net-negative emissions. They will have to capture emissions from the
boiler, in addition to the fermentation process, and make a few other
tweaks, like using renewable natural gas, according to
<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c04784" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
recent peer-reviewed study</u></a> Sanchez authored. “That’s not what’s
happening here,” he told me, “but I view that as indicative that this is
part of the basket of technologies that we use to reach net-zero and to
suck CO2 out of the air.”
</p>
<p>
(Red Trail is working on reducing its emissions even more, Johnson told
me. The company is finishing engineering on a new combined heat and
power system that will improve efficiency at the plant.)
</p>
<p>
In addition to teaching at Berkeley, Sanchez is a principal scientist
for the firm
<a href="https://www.carbon-direct.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Carbon
Direct</u></a>, which helps corporate buyers find “high quality” carbon
removal credits. He added that he felt the project was “worthy” of the
dollars companies are designating for carbon removal because of the risk
it involved, and the fact that it would blaze a trail for others to
follow. Ethanol CCS projects will help build up carbon storage
infrastructure and expertise, enabling other carbon removal projects in
the future.
</p>
<p>
Though there is seeming consensus among carbon market participants that
this is carbon removal, scientists outside the industry are more
skeptical. Katherine Maher, an Earth systems scientist who studies the
carbon cycle at Stanford University, said she understood the argument
for calling ethanol with CCS carbon removal, but she also couldn’t
ignore the fact that capturing the carbon requires energy to grow the
corn, transport it, and so on. “You really need to be conscious about,
what are the other emissions in the project, and are those being
accounted for in the calculation of the CO2 removed?”
</p>
<p>
Carbon180, a nonprofit that advocates for carbon removal policy, shares
that perspective. “When it comes to ethanol with CCS, we want to see the
actual net negativity,” Sifang Chen, the group’s managing science and
innovation advisor, told me.
</p>
<p>
In the U.S. Department of Energy’s
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/articles/department-energy-roads-removal-report-maps-path-gigatonne-scale-co2-removal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Road
to Removals report</u></a>, a 221-page document that highlights all of
the opportunities for carbon removal in the United States, the agency
specifically chose not to analyze ethanol with CCS “due largely to its
inability to achieve a negative [carbon intensity] without substantial
retrofitting of existing corn-ethanol facilities.”
</p>
<p>
It’s possible to say that both views are correct. Each follows a clear
logic — one more rooted in creating practical rules for a market in
order to drive innovation, the other in the uncompromising math of
atmospheric science.
</p>
<p>
At times throughout writing this, I wondered if I was making something
out of nothing. But the debate has significance beyond ethanol. Sanchez
pointed out to me that you could ask the same question about any
so-called carbon removal process that’s tied to an existing industry.
Take enhanced rock weathering, for example, which involves crushing up
special kinds of rocks that are especially good at absorbing carbon from
the air. A lot of the companies trying to do this get their rocks from
mining waste, but they don’t include all the emissions from mining in
their carbon removal calculation.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, Summit Carbon Solutions noted that CarbonPlan supports claims
of carbon removal by Charm Industrial, a company that takes the biomass
left behind in corn fields, turns it into oil, and sequesters the oil
underground. In that case, the company is not counting emissions from
corn production or the downstream uses of corn.
</p>
<p>
Chay admitted that she didn’t have a great answer for why she drew the
boundaries differently for one versus the other. “We don’t claim to have
all the answers, and this back-and-forth illustrates just how much
ambiguity there is and why it’s important to work through these issues,”
she told me in an email. But she suggested that one point of comparison
is to look at how dependent the carbon removal activity is on “the
ongoing operation of a net emitting industry, and how one thinks about
the role of that emitting industry in a net-zero world.” There is no
apparent version of the future where we no longer have mining as an
industry, or no longer grow corn for food. But there is a path to
eliminating the use of ethanol by electrifying transportation.
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s worth mentioning that this niche debate about carbon removal is
taking place within a much larger and longer controversy about whether
ethanol belongs in a low-carbon future at all.
</p>
<p>
Red Trail told me the company sees the adoption of electric vehicles as
an opportunity to diversify into making fuels for aviation and
heavy-duty transportation, which are more difficult to electrify. But
some environmental groups, like the World Resources Institute, argue
that
<a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/us-sustainable-aviation-fuel-emissions-impacts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
more sustainable approach</u></a> would be to develop synthetic fuels
from captured carbon and hydrogen. I should note that experts from both
sides of this debate told me that carbon credit sales should not justify
keeping an ethanol plant open or building a new one if the economics of
the fuel don’t work on their own.
</p>
<p>
In Chay’s blog post, she presented real stakes for this rhetorical
debate. If we call net-emitting processes carbon removal, we could
develop an inflated sense of how much progress we’ve made toward our
overall capacity to remove carbon from the atmosphere, which in turn
could warp perceptions of how quickly we need to reduce emissions.
</p>
<p>
Peter Minor, the former director of science and innovation at Carbon180
who is starting a company focused on measurement and verification,
raised the same concern. “When the definition of what it means to remove
a ton of CO2 from the air is subjective, what happens is you get a bunch
of projects that might have quite different climate impacts,” he told
me. “And you may or may not realize it until after the fact.”
</p>
<p>
There’s also a risk of diverting funding that could go toward scaling up
more challenging, more expensive, but truly net-negative solutions such
as direct air capture. This risk is compounded by the growing pressure
on carbon market players like Puro and Carbon Direct to identify new,
more affordable carbon removal projects. Over the past several years,
influential groups like the Science Based Targets initiative and
corporate sustainability thought leaders like Stripe and Microsoft have
decided that old-school carbon credits — the cheaper so-called “offsets”
that represent emissions reductions — are not good enough. Now companies
are expected to buy carbon removal credits to fulfill their climate
promises to customers, lest they be accused of greenwashing.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the industry has backed itself into a corner, Minor told
me. “We have come out as a society and said, the only thing that is
worth it, the only thing that is allowed to be used is carbon removal,”
he said. “So if that’s the only thing with economics behind it, then
yeah, like, magic! Everything is now all of a sudden carbon removal! Who
would have predicted that this could have happened?”
</p>
<p>
The success of carbon removal depends, ultimately, on integrity — the
industry’s favorite word these days. From the companies trying to remove
carbon, to the carbon credit registries validating those efforts, to the
nonprofits, brokers, and buyers that want to see the market scale,
everyone is talking about developing transparent and trustworthy
processes for measuring how much carbon is removed from the atmosphere
by a given intervention. But how good is good measurement if experts
don’t agree on what should be measured?
</p>
<p>
“There hasn’t been a way to standardize the climate impacts that are
being promised,” said Minor. “And so I think unless we solve that
problem, I just don’t see how we’re going to build the trust we need, to
create the economics that we need and justify an industry that can’t
really exist outside of the millions or billions of tons scale.”

The report says the trend is driven in part by a rise in lawsuits
targeting the “professional and financial services that enable the work
of fossil fuel companies.” For example, marketing and advertising
companies that create positive campaigns for oil and gas firms. And
another factor here is sectors that rely heavily on fossil fuels
(airlines, for example) but may attempt to “climate wash” by overstating
their environmental initiatives. These kinds of corporate lawsuits are
becoming more and more common, and more than 70% have been successful.
The report concludes that “companies from many sectors are now at risk
of being taken to court over the climate.”

I don't see the problem. The assignment operator
<code data-sourcepos="1:51-1:52">:=</code> is used within its own

but not something that the compiler should syntactically reject.

<h2 id="ads-hypocrisy">Ads hypocrisy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I was browsing the web—like I often do—and I stumbled on a message on a website that read:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
If you’re reading this, you blocked our ad. That’s cool, we block ads
too. This site is free though, so maybe unblock the ad so we can keep
paying for this website that you’re on, thanks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This message rubbed me in the wrong way for a variety of reasons. First,
the hypocrisy of its content is annoying: we do something to others but
you should not do the same to us. Isn’t the whole <em>“Don’t do unto
others what you don’t want done unto you.”</em> common wisdom at this
point? Second, the <em>“This site is free though”</em> is a shitty
attempt to justify having ads served by an AD network because that’s
literally what every goddamn site out there does. Facebook is free.
Should I allow the tracking because of it? And lastly, the <em>“so we
can keep paying for this website”</em> is a desperate attempt to guilt
trip me into disabling my adblocker. I know very well how much running a
site like that costs. And I know for a fact the people behind that site
all have daily jobs. And so they can easily afford to pay for this site
exactly like countless others are paying for theirs.
</p>
<p>
The discourse around advertising on the web is messy. And the
pervasiveness of ads doesn’t help. You can just see how advertising
manages to find its way into almost everything. But if you’re a creator
of any kind it’s important to recognise the hypocrisy in some of the
arguments that are floating out there. The most glaring example is
YouTube. People often argue that by watching YouTube with adblockers I’m
stealing revenues from creators. Fair. The proposed solution is to pay
for YouTube Premium. Again, fair. My question is: are creators going to
upload YT Premium exclusive versions of the videos without their
sponsors’ ad reads baked in? The answer is no because that’s where the
vast majority of the revenues come from for them. And that’s another
example of the hypocrisy that’s powering this entire business model.
</p>
<p>
I don’t hate the general concept of an AD. I think sponsorships and
partnerships can be a net benefit if done correctly, especially when
done without tracking and profiling. If you run a site that’s focused on
a niche, the profiling is implicit. For example, the people who visit
minimalissimo.com probably have an interest in design and architecture
otherwise they wouldn’t waste their time on that site. And so if I were
to do some sort of partnership it would make sense to work with
companies that make products within those niches. That’s how “good”
advertising should work on the web. And that’s how it used to be before
hyper-targeting was a thing. Mind you, it’s still an option and plenty
of people do do it. It pays less than targeting advertising, for obvious
reasons. But creators need to do their part if we hope to make progress
on this front. Because the future can’t be targeted advertising
everywhere at anytime.
</p>
<p>
I’m not going to disable my adblocker for you. I’m running two at the
same time precisely because I don’t give a fuck about your stupid
targeted ad. But if you give me an option to donate something to you
directly I’m gonna do it. Because I believe contributing directly is the
most sane way to keep this whole boat afloat.

pandas en route from China to US under conservation partnership</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO — A pair of giant pandas are on their way from China to the
U.S., where they will be cared for at the San Diego Zoo as part of an
ongoing conservation partnership between the two nations, officials said
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance were on hand in
China for a farewell ceremony commemorating the departure of the giant
pandas, Yun Chuan and Xin Bao.</p>
<p>The celebration included cultural performances, video salutations
from Chinese and American students and a gift exchange among
conservation partners, the zoo said in a statement. After the ceremony,
the giant pandas began their trip to Southern California.</p>
<p>“This farewell celebrates their journey and underscores a
collaboration between the United States and China on vital conservation
efforts,” Paul Baribault, the wildlife alliance president, said in a
statement. “Our long-standing partnership with China Wildlife
Conservation Association has been instrumental in advancing giant panda
conservation, and we look forward to continuing our work together to
ensure the survival and thriving of this iconic species.”</p>
<p>It could be several weeks before the giant pandas will be viewable to
the public in San Diego, officials said.</p>
<p>Yun Chuan, a mild-mannered male who’s nearly 5 years old, has
connections to California, the wildlife alliance said previously. His
mother, Zhen Zhen, was born at the San Diego Zoo in 2007 to parents Bai
Yun and Gao Gao.</p>
<p>Xin Bao is a nearly 4-year-old female described as “a gentle and
witty introvert with a sweet round face and big ears.”</p>
<p>The San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance has a nearly 30-year partnership
with leading conservation institutions in China focused on protecting
and recovering giant pandas and the bamboo forests they depend on.</p>

mounts Islamic State is looking to the US southern border</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. intelligence and security officials are increasing
their focus on the country’s southern border, worried the constant flow
of migrants has attracted the attention of the Islamic State terror
group.</p>
<p>The heightened concern follows the arrests earlier this month of
eight men from Tajikistan, all of whom entered the United States via its
southern border with Mexico, some making the trip over a year ago.</p>
<p>While the initial background checks came up clean, U.S. law
enforcement subsequently turned up information indicating potential ties
to the Islamic State group, also known as IS or ISIS.</p>
<p>“It’s not lost on us that the people who killed over 150 Russians in
that theater were from the same part of the world,” said Ken Wainstein,
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s undersecretary for
intelligence and analysis, referring to the March attack on a Moscow
concert hall, claimed by the terror group’s Afghan affiliate. </p>
<p>Wainstein, testifying Wednesday before the House Homeland Security
Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, said concern about the potential for
IS to exploit the border has led to daily meetings with the director of
the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), as well as
unprecedented cooperation with the FBI.</p>
<p>But he sought to downplay concerns stemming from intelligence
suggesting that the IS-linked human smuggling network may have brought
more than 400 migrants from Central Asia into the U.S., across the
southern border.</p>
<p>“There is not information which suggests those particular individuals
are terrorist operatives,” Wainstein told lawmakers.</p>
<p>Information on the 400 migrants, first reported by NBC News,
indicates more than 150 of the migrants have been arrested. But
officials told NBC that the whereabouts of more than 50 others are
unknown.</p>
<p>The newfound concerns about terror groups like IS actively trying to
exploit the southern border seems to indicate a significant shift in the
threat landscape.</p>
<p>For years, U.S. counterterrorism officials have maintained there was
no evidence that IS or other Sunni terror groups were trying to
infiltrate the U.S. along its border with Mexico. </p>
<p>And this past November, NCTC Director Christine Abizaid told
lawmakers that while counterterrorism officials “absolutely recognize
the risk,” evidence for such plots was lacking.</p>
<p>“We don’t have indications that are credible or corroborated,” she
told members of the House of Representatives at the time.</p>
<p>But U.S. and Turkish sanctions unveiled earlier this month may point
to the Islamic State terror group’s growing interest in human
smuggling.</p>
<p>The sanctions focus on what the U.S. Treasury Department described as
a Eurasian human smuggling network that was providing support for IS
members in Turkey. </p>
<p>One of the key operatives, Olimkhon Ismailov, is based in Uzbekistan.
And Ismailov had high-level help, with Treasury alleging he was given
guidance by the leader of IS in the Republic of Georgia, Adam
Khamirzaev.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. State Department, Khamirzaev apparently had his
sights set on the U.S. </p>
<p>The IS-Georgia emir “provided guidance to this network on a range of
activities supporting ISIS and was aware of its efforts to facilitate
travelers to the United States,” the State Department said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Multiple U.S. agencies, including DHS, the FBI and the State
Department declined to respond to questions about the reach of the
Eurasian human smuggling network involved with IS operatives in Turkey
and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p>There are also no indications that the sanctioned network is
connected to the same IS-linked network that brought the eight men from
Tajikistan, or the hundreds of other Central Asian migrants, into the
U.S. through the southern border.</p>
<p>As for the eight men from Tajikistan, Homeland Security Secretary
Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters in Tucson, Arizona, Wednesday that,
“They are in removal proceedings as we speak.”</p>
<p>And other U.S. officials say they have stepped up security
measures.</p>
<p>“We have increased our vigilance at our border,” said Jen Daskal, the
White House deputy Homeland Security adviser, virtually addressing a
counterterrorism conference Wednesday in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>
<p>“We have enhanced our screening and vetting, instituted recurrent
vetting of migrants to identify newly uncovered threats and detain those
who pose a public safety threat,” she said.</p>
<p>But Daskal admitted the threat from IS, and especially its Afghan
affiliate, persists.</p>
<p>“Both ISIS and ISIS-Khorasan, or what we call ISIS-K, have
demonstrated a capability and intent to conduct external operations,”
she said.</p>

<h2>
Upgrading to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 2
</h2>
<p>
To upgrade to PostgreSQL 17 Beta 2 from an earlier version of
PostgreSQL, you will need to use a strategy similar to upgrading between
major versions of PostgreSQL (e.g. <code>pg_upgrade</code> or
<code>pg_dump</code> / <code>pg_restore</code>). For more information,
please visit the documentation section on
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/static/upgrading.html">upgrading</a>.
</p>
<h2>
Changes Since Beta 1
</h2>
<p>
Fixes and changes in PostgreSQL 17 Beta 2 include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Correctly enforce the default behavior of the <code>ON EMPTY</code>
clause when it’s not present in a SQL/JSON query.
</li>
<li>
Fixed issue with <code>pg_logical_slot_get_changes</code> related to
resource ownership.
</li>
<li>
Several fixes around the new data structure for vacuum-related data.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Testing for Bugs &amp; Compatibility
</h2>
<p>
The stability of each PostgreSQL release greatly depends on you, the
community, to test the upcoming version with your workloads and testing
tools in order to find bugs and regressions before the general
availability of PostgreSQL 17. As this is a Beta, minor changes to
database behaviors, feature details, and APIs are still possible. Your
feedback and testing will help determine the final tweaks on the new
features, so please test in the near future. The quality of user testing
helps determine when we can make a final release.
</p>
<p>
A list of
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_17_Open_Items">open
issues</a> is publicly available in the PostgreSQL wiki. You can

<h2>
Beta Schedule
</h2>
<p>
This is the second beta release of version 17. The PostgreSQL Project
will release additional betas as required for testing, followed by one
or more release candidates, until the final release around
September/October 2024. For further information please see the

<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-metadata-matching">The anatomy of metadata
matching</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-27, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-matching-101-what-is-it-and-why-do-we-need-it/">previous
blog post</a> about metadata matching, we discussed what it is and why
we need it (tl;dr: to discover more relationships within the scholarly
record). Here, we will describe some basic matching-related terminology
and the components of a matching process. We will also pose some typical
product questions to consider when developing or integrating matching
solutions.
</p>
<h2 id="basic-terminology">
Basic terminology
</h2>
<p>
Metadata matching is a high-level concept, with many different problems
falling into this category. Indeed, no matter how much we like to focus
on the similarities between different forms of matching, matching
affiliation strings to ROR IDs or matching preprints to journal papers
are still different in several important ways. At Crossref and ROR, we
call these problems matching tasks.
</p>
<p>
Simply put, a <strong>matching task</strong> defines the kind or nature
of the matching. Examples of matching tasks are bibliographic reference
matching, affiliation matching, grant matching, or preprint matching.
</p>
<p>
Every matching task has an input, which is all the data that is needed
to perform the matching. Input data can come in many shapes and forms,
depending on the matching task. For example, all of the following could
be inputs to a matching task:
</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan
</code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;fr:program xmlns:fr=&#34;http://www.crossref.org/fundref.xsd&#34; name=&#34;fundref&#34;&gt;

&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;fr:assertion name=&#34;award_number&#34;&gt;721624&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;/fr:assertion&gt;
&lt;/fr:program&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Everitt, W. N., &amp; Kalf, H. (2007). The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform. Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 208(1), 3–19.
</code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
&#34;title&#34;: &#34;Functional single-cell genomics of human cytomegalovirus infection&#34;,

]
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Every matching task also has an <strong>output</strong>. For our
purposes, this is almost exclusively zero or more matched identifiers.
In the context of a specific matching task, output identifiers may be of
a specific type (e.g. we might match to a ROR ID, and never to an ORCID
ID). In some cases, there can be a certain target set as well
(i.e. matching only to DataCite DOIs). The output identifiers can have
different
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality" target="_blank">cardinality</a>
depending on the task, meaning that the matching task might allow for
zero, one, or more identifiers as a result of matching to a single
input.
</p>
<p>
A <strong>matching strategy</strong> defines how the matching is done.
Multiple strategies can exist for a specific matching task. Compound
strategies can run other strategies and combine their outcomes into a
single result.
</p>
<p>
In some cases, we may also want the matching strategy to output a
confidence score for each matched identifier. A confidence score
represents the degree of certainty or likelihood that the matched
identifier is correct, typically expressed as a value between 0 and 1.
This score may help with post-processing or further interpretation of
the results.

To summarise, the anatomy of the matching task can be diagrammed as
follows:

How to specify a matching task
</h2>
<p>
Whenever we plan the development or integration of a matching solution,
it is good to begin by answering a few basic questions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What problem do we plan to solve with our matching task? What would we
call our matching task and how would we describe it?
</li>
<li>
What do we expect as the input for this matching task? Which input
formats do we need to be able to accept? What information do we expect
to find in this input?
</li>
<li>
What kind of identifiers should be output? Is there a target set of
identifiers? Can our matching output zero/one/or multiple identifiers,
and under what conditions might that occur?
</li>
</ol>
<p>
These sound fairly simple, but the answers to these questions can be
remarkably complex. Once one tries to apply these concepts to real-world
problems, they might encounter several non-obvious challenges.
</p>
<p>
For example, one common concern is at what level we should define each
matching task. Consider the following problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Matching bibliographic reference strings to DOIs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Everitt, W. N., &amp; Kalf, H. (2007). The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform. Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics, 208(1), 3–19.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
Matching structured bibliographic reference to DOIs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>{
volume: &#34;208&#34;,
author: &#34;Everitt&#34;,
journal-title: &#34;J. Comput. Appl. Math.&#34;,
article-title: &#34;The Bessel differential equation and the Hankel transform&#34;,
first-page: &#34;3&#34;,
year: &#34;2007&#34;,
issue: &#34;1&#34;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
Are those discrete matching tasks (<em>unstructured reference
matching</em> vs. <em>structured reference matching</em>), or are they
the same task (<em>reference matching</em>) that can accept different
types of inputs (unstructured or structured)?
</p>
<p>
Similarly, let’s compare the following tasks:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Matching affiliation strings to ROR IDs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
Matching funder names to ROR IDs. Example input:
</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Alexander von Humboldt Foundation
</code></pre>
<p>
Are these different matching tasks (<em>affiliation matching</em>
vs. <em>funder matching</em>), or the same task with different inputs
(<em>organisation matching</em>)?
</p>
<p>
Defining the boundaries of a matching task can also be difficult.
Consider, for example, the need to obtain ROR IDs for organisations
mentioned in the acknowledgements section of a full-text academic paper.
To begin, one may first extract the acknowledgement section from the
full text, then run something like a named entity recognition (NER) tool
to isolate the organisation names from the extracted text, and finally
match these names to ROR IDs. Is this entire process matching, with the
input being the full text of a paper? Or perhaps matching starts with
the acknowledgement section as the input? Instead, is it only the last
phase, where we try to match the extracted name to the ROR ID, that
constitutes the matching task, with the extraction phases being
completely separate processes?
</p>
<p>
There are also important questions related to the expected behaviour of
a matching strategy. Consider, for example, developing an affiliation
matching strategy where we define our input as “an affiliation string”.
What should happen when the strategy gets something else on the input,
for example, song lyrics? Perhaps the strategy should simply return no
matches, or an error, or we could say that in such a situation the
behaviour is undefined and it simply doesn’t matter what is returned.
But what should happen if in this input we have the lyrics of
<a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/roxymusic/streetlife.html" target="_blank">Street
Life by Roxy Music</a>, a song that mentions the names of a few
universities that happen to have ROR IDs?
</p>
<p>
It is likewise important to consider what should happen if different
parts of the input match to different identifiers, like in the following
example:
</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Department of Haematology, Eastern Health and Monash University, Box Hill, Australia
</code></pre>
<p>
Here, “Eastern Health” matches to
<a href="https://ror.org/00vyyx863" target="_blank">https://ror.org/00vyyx863</a>
and “Monash University” to
<a href="https://ror.org/02bfwt286" target="_blank">https://ror.org/02bfwt286</a>.
Should the matching strategy return all the identifiers, one of them (if
so, which one?), or nothing at all?
</p>
<p>
Similar questions arise when it is possible to match to multiple
versions (or duplicates) in the target identifier set. This can happen,
for example, in the context of bibliographic reference matching or
preprint matching. Multiple matches may occur when there are different
editions, reprints, or variations of the same publication in the target
dataset, each with its own unique identifier.
</p>
<p>
If you are waiting for an answer to these questions, we unfortunately
must disappoint you here. These can only be answered in the context of a
specific problem, considering who the users are and what it is they need
and expect.
</p>
<p>
Did you notice any other subtleties related to metadata matching and its
concerns? Are there other non-obvious questions that should be
considered when planning to develop or integrate metadata matching
strategies? Let us know—we’d love to hear from you!
