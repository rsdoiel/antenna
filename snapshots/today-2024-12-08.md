date: 2024-12-08, from: Liliputing

This little [&#8230;]</p>

I drive a Tesla Model Y, the best car I&#39;ve ever owned. I wish Elon Musk wasn&#39;t associated with it. If there were a good alternative to the Tesla, I would divest in a minute. I could afford to do it and would welcome the opportunity.

## Matchup in Neovim for Go templates

date: 2024-12-07, from: Miek Giebin blog

After dealing with Go templates (also HTML templates) for more than a year and keep loosing track of where each block {{ends}} I finally did something about it.
But that didn&rsquo;t work that good. So I&rsquo;ve switch to the match-up plugin, which is better than the built-in matchit that I was using previously. With Neovim I&rsquo;m using this setup:
Plug &#39;andymass/vim-matchup&#39; And this extra bit of config:
require&#39;nvim-treesitter.configs&#39;.setup { matchup = { enable = true, }, } This in itself does not make template completion work, for this I just copied the Hugo template completion (which is just like Go templating) to the correct place.
