## ‘Robust' US has helped improve global economic outlook, IMF chief says

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Strong growth in the United States has helped to lift the outlook for the world economy, but more needs to be done to stem a slide in productivity, the head of the IMF said Thursday. 


"Global growth is marginally stronger on account of robust activity in the United States and in many emerging markets economies," International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva told reporters in prepared remarks. 


The U.S. economy grew by 2.5 percent last year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, far outstripping most other advanced economies. 


"Robust household consumption and business investment, and an easing of supply chain problems helped," Georgieva added. "And inflation is going down, somewhat faster than previously expected." 


She spoke just a few days before the IMF-World Bank spring meetings of world financial leaders in Washington, one of two such gatherings hosted each year by the international financial institutions. 


Her remarks suggest the IMF now expects the world economy to grow faster than it predicted in January, when it forecast global growth to rise by 3.1 percent in 2024, and 3.2 percent in 2025. 


"It is tempting to breathe a sigh of relief. We have avoided a global recession and a period of stagflation — as some had predicted," Georgieva said. "But there are still plenty of things to worry about." 


Among the challenges, Georgieva mentioned rising geopolitical tension, which, she said, is increasing the risks of fragmentation of the global economy. 


She also highlighted the challenges of growing public debt and a "broad-based slowdown in productivity." 


Because of this, the IMF expects growth to remain at just above 3 percent over the medium term — below its historical average. 


To help the global economy to heal and fix the productivity challenge, Georgieva laid out a series of steps to bring global inflation and public debt back down to sustainable levels, and also called for steps to eliminate "constraints to economic activity" and boost productivity. 


"In short, if there is a market failure that is being addressed — such as accelerating innovation to address the existential threat of climate change — there is a case for government intervention, including through industrial policy," she said. 


"If there is no market failure, there is a need for caution," she added.

## Meta trials a new feature to protect teens

<p>Meta’s latest answer to protecting kids on Instagram is automatically blurring images that may contain nudity. The company says it will test this on the platform’s direct messaging feature. We&#8217;ll parse the details. Plus, the FCC is requiring large internet providers to post &#8220;broadband nutrition labels&#8221; that provide a snapshot of charges and performance data. Will they impact consumers&#8217; internet diet? And a recent survey finds that CEOs are feeling pretty optimistic.</p>

## China sanctions 2 US defense companies and says they support arms sales to Taiwan

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

Beijing — China on Thursday announced rare sanctions against two U.S. defense companies over what it said is their support for arms sales to Taiwan, the self-governing island democracy Beijing claims as its own territory to be recovered by force if necessary.


The announcement freezes the assets of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and General Dynamics Land Systems held within China. It also bars the companies' management from entering the country. 


Filings show General Dynamics operates a half-dozen Gulfstream and jet aviation services operations in China, which remains heavily reliant on foreign aerospace technology even as it attempts to build its own presence in the field. 


The company helps make the Abrams tank being purchased by Taiwan to replace outdated armor intended to deter or resist an invasion from China. 


General Atomics produces the Predator and Reaper drones used by the U.S. military. Chinese authorities did not go into details on the company's alleged involvement with supplying arms to Taiwan. 


Beijing has long threatened such sanctions, but has rarely issued them as its economy reels from the COVID-19 pandemic, high unemployment and a sharp decline in foreign investment. 


"The continued U.S. arms sales to China's Taiwan region seriously violate the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, interfere in China's internal affairs, and undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity," China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It insists that the mainland and the island to which Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces fled amid civil war in 1949 remain part of a single Chinese nation. 


Sanctions were leveled under Beijing's recently enacted Law of the People's Republic of China on Countering Foreign Sanctions. 


General Dynamics fully owned entities are registered in Hong Kong, the southern Chinese semi-autonomous city over which Beijing has steadily been increasing its political and economic control to the point that it faces no vocal opposition and has seen its critics silenced, imprisoned or forced into exile. 


Despite their lack of formal diplomatic ties — a concession Washington made to Beijing when they established relations in 1979 — the U.S. remains Taiwan's most important source of diplomatic support and supplier of military hardware from fighter jets to air defense systems. 


Taiwan has also been investing heavily in its own defense industry, producing sophisticated missiles and submarines. 


China had 14 warplanes and six navy ships operating around Taiwan on Wednesday and Thursday, with six of the aircraft crossing into Taiwan's air defense identification zone — a tactic to test Taiwan's defenses, wear down its capabilities and intimidate the population. 


So far, that has had little effect, with the vast majority of the island's 23 million people opposing political unification with China.

## Backdoor in XZ Utils That Almost Happened

<p>Last week, the internet dodged a major nation-state attack that would have had catastrophic cybersecurity repercussions worldwide. It’s a catastrophe that didn’t happen, so it won’t get much attention&#8212;but it should. There’s an important moral to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/">story of the attack</a> and its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/technology/prevent-cyberattack-linux.html">discovery</a>: The security of the global internet depends on countless obscure pieces of software written and maintained by even more obscure unpaid, distractible, and sometimes vulnerable volunteers. It’s an untenable situation, and one that is being exploited by malicious actors. Yet precious little is being done to remedy it...</p>

## Decarbonization Won’t Pay — at Least Not on Its Own

date: 2024-04-11, from: Heatmap News

I kept hearing that our job was ultimately to make these projects “bankable.” As the logic went, “<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1234" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>there is a sizeable universe of good projects that fall just below many private investors’ desired rate of return</u></a>,” and therefore lowering the risks of investing in these “good projects” would put them within reach of private investors’ return expectations. To make decarbonization possible, we had to make decarbonization profitable.</p>
<p>This claim cuts straight through Brett Christophers’ latest book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-price-is-wrong-why-capitalism-won-t-save-the-planet-brett-christophers/20125262" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The Price is Wrong: Why Capitalism Won’t Save the Planet</em></em></u></a>, which argues that the cost of developing and generating renewable energy is <em><em>not</em></em> what will determine the speed or scale of its uptake. It might finally be cheaper to build solar panels and wind farms than a coal or gas plant, that’s for sure. But given the structure of our energy markets today, it does not follow that assets that are cheap to build are necessarily profitable enough to provide adequate returns to investors.</p>
<p>My old colleagues might have already been aware of this fact, but as Christophers highlights, it’s certainly not intuitive, even to many analysts. Nor are its implications: Decarbonization won’t happen if it’s not profitable enough ― and it’s not profitable enough. </p>
<p>Christophers is a professor at Sweden’s Uppsala University in its “department of human geography,” whose research focuses on how capitalism and the modern financial system shape our lives; in this book, that also includes our energy systems. To make his case, he highlights the vicious feedback loop affecting renewables endemic to today’s energy markets. Government support to build renewable energy drives down its marginal cost, but because there’s now more renewable energy available at any given moment, the falling costs cut into developers’ expected returns, requiring more government support to keep investors and developers interested in the sector. </p>
<p>Combine this dynamic with technical features endemic to renewable energy generation, including its intermittency, and the result is a wholesale electricity market with perennially unstable prices. This volatility throttles the expected returns on any investment in renewable energy. No matter how cheap it is to build renewable energy, private investors and developers won’t decarbonize our globe at the speed or scale we deserve ― not under these financial conditions, at least.</p>
<p>Christophers leans on two theoretical guideposts here. First, Andreas Malm, whose assessment of how the profit motive, not relative costs, drove Britain’s first energy transition from water-wheels to coal and steam is an unmistakable conceptual parallel to today’s transition. Second, Karl Polanyi, whose theory of “fictitious commodities” — referring to land, labor, and money, each of which the state and society must painstakingly regulate<em> </em>into fungible market-friendly products ― Christophers aptly applies to electricity and the artificial markets created around it. </p>
<p>But rather than hew to theory to justify why the energy system needs to be socialized to achieve decarbonization ― which is definitely true, by the way; the profit motive is supremely unhelpful here ― Christophers embraces a holistic understanding of the economy as a set of financial relationships, supply chains, planned markets, and legal institutions connecting various public and private entities with different motives.</p>
<p>That means interviewing investors, who tell him things like: “Low returns and volatility don’t go. No bank in the world will take power price risk at low returns.” Christophers also produces a detailed and data-rich breakdown of the interlocking global energy crises in 2021 and 2022, jumping between Texas, China, India, Australia, and across Europe, to make a larger point about energy markets. These crises were “not taken to be evidence of the failings of markets, or even a reason to question their role as the pre-eminent mechanism of coordination to the state’s electricity sector,” he writes; “the market was regarded as the very means to <em><em>manage </em></em>the crisis.” But the markets aren’t working. Something has to give.</p>
<p>He ends the book with a call for socialized power, inspired by the Green New Deal and New York’s Build Public Renewables Act, championed by the state’s democratic socialists on the explicit grounds that, because delivering on the state’s emissions targets is not profitable enough for the private sector to do alone, the public sector must get the job done. With the force of the whole book’s arguments and evidence behind it, this policy prescription hardly appears radical.</p>
<h3>How to Intervene in an Energy Market</h3><p>Public developers can accept lower profitability thresholds, and public finance institutions can provide debt on more forgiving terms; under the public aegis, rates of return and costs of capital become policy choices. Christophers admits in his introduction that he is more focused on unearthing the fragile relationships among actors across the renewable energy industry than on describing the ways a New York-inspired socialized power sector could function. Given <em><em>how much</em></em> there is to unearth, it’s a reasonable choice, but it leaves readers without a working heuristic for the different ways states can intervene in the business of energy. </p>
<p>Here’s my attempt: Energy must be financed, generated, distributed, and consumed. Government intervention in favor of decarbonization looks distinct at each step. </p>
<p>Governments can provide <em><em>consumption support</em></em> by shielding ratepayers from the higher electricity bills that come from potential utility investments into renewable energy procurement and decarbonization-related grid management, backstopping utility investments through a demand guarantee. Consumption support is equitable, but it’s also indirect and incomplete — it might provide a utility with more financial breathing room to procure or develop renewables, but if renewables are not available to procure on the grid or are not easy to develop, this demand guarantee likely just pads the utility’s bottom line.</p>
<p>Governments can provide <em><em>distribution support</em></em> by encouraging utilities to purchase renewable energy. Distribution support most often takes the form of regulatory nudges: In the United States, mandates like Renewable Portfolio Standards force utilities to increase their clean energy procurement, guaranteeing purchase demand for clean electricity and Renewable Energy Certificates, which companies might buy to clean up their own energy portfolios. </p>
<p>These demand-guarantee interventions <em><em>have</em></em> helped speed up renewable energy development nationwide, but with limits. In particular, utility power purchase agreements don’t provide developers with adequate price stability because utilities fix the quantity of energy they purchase rather than the price; corporate PPAs, meanwhile, cannot be relied on at scale because there aren’t enough large creditworthy corporations like Google and Amazon willing to commit to buying energy from new projects at a fixed price. For these reasons and more, supporting utilities’ efforts to decarbonize will not call forth adequate renewable energy generation sources into existence.</p>
<p><em><em>Generation support</em></em> is what most governments already do. Whether through feed-in tariffs, production tax credits, or contracts for difference, generation support entails propping up generators’ profitability, ensuring that the sale price of their energy is never too low. Christophers explains why this mechanism — that is, a revenue guarantee rather than a demand guarantee — is deeply necessary: Renewable energy sources and the energy markets they’re plugged into are both structurally volatile, so, no matter how much energy they generate, they never generate all that much profit. Withdrawing generation support would be, in no uncertain terms, a death knell for renewables development.</p>
<p>And, finally, <em><em>financing support</em></em> targets renewable energy sources as capital-intensive assets requiring huge amounts of upfront debt. Whether through the investment tax credit, viability gap funding, concessional financing, or other forms of cost-share plans, financing support is another form of <em><em>direct</em></em> price support for generation companies; by lowering a project’s cost of capital, it helps lower its developer’s threshold for project profitability, meaning that generators pay less debt service and keep more of their revenues. High interest rates have lately forced up the cost of debt for renewable energy projects to unsustainable levels, far above private developers’ prospective rates of return. Financing support is a must-have these days ― and it’s all the more necessary across the Global South, where the costs of capital are far higher.</p>
<p>None of this is to say that socializing generation and finance solves every problem ― as far as the United States is concerned, non-financial barriers abound, such as regulations and interconnection queues ― but within the existing structure of energy markets, public ownership <em><em>does</em></em> solve a lot.</p>
<p>What does direct government intervention into energy consumption and distribution look like? Public ownership of local distribution utilities is a start. Unlike private utility companies, they don’t need to promise <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-26/green-goals-clash-with-higher-power-bills-exelon-ceo-says" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ten percent returns</u></a> to shareholders, and can use the financial breathing room that comes from lower profitability thresholds to tamp down rate hikes and, perhaps more importantly, rate volatility. Public utilities will not drive decarbonization, but they could potentially help advance transmission reform and better integrate distributed energy resources into the grid.</p>
<p>Christophers all but argues that the best thing governments can do for all four support categories is to redesign energy markets. Beyond simply incentivizing the deployment of clean firm and battery technologies to complement renewables, policymakers’ biggest task is to build an energy system where volatile wholesale energy prices ― which even publicly owned renewable energy developers will have to face for the foreseeable future ― are not the reason that a project fails to get built. That would be a policy failure, and we don’t have time for those.</p>

## Scientists struggle to protect infant corals from hungry fish

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.  — South Florida researchers trying to prevent predatory fish from devouring laboratory-grown coral are grasping at biodegradable straws in an effort to restore what some call the rainforest of the sea.


Scientists around the world have been working for years to address the decline of coral reef populations. Just last summer, reef rescue groups in South Florida and the Florida Keys were trying to save coral from rising ocean temperatures. Besides working to keep existing coral alive, researchers have also been growing new coral in labs and then placing them in the ocean.


But protecting the underwater ecosystem that maintains more than 25% of all marine species is not easy. Even more challenging is making sure that coral grown in a laboratory and placed into the ocean doesn't become expensive fish food.


Marine researcher Kyle Pisano said one problem is that predators like parrot fish attempt to bite and destroy the newly transplanted coral in areas like South Florida, leaving them with less than a 40% survival rate. With projects calling for thousands of coral to be planted over the next year and tens of thousands of coral to be planted over the next decade, the losses add up when coral pieces can cost more than $100 each.


Pisano and his partner, Kirk Dotson, have developed the Coral Fort, claiming the small biodegradable cage that's made in part with drinking straws boosts the survival rate of transplanted coral to over 90%.


"Parrot fish on the reef really, really enjoy biting a newly transplanted coral," Pisano said. "They treat it kind of like popcorn."




Fortunately the fish eventually lose interest in the coral as it matures, but scientists need to protect the coral in the meantime. Stainless steel and PVC pipe barriers have been set up around transplanted coral in the past, but those barriers needed to be cleaned of algae growth and eventually removed.


Pisano had the idea of creating a protective barrier that would eventually dissolve, eliminating the need to maintain or remove it. He began conducting offshore experiments with biodegradable coral cages as part of a master's degree program at Nova Southeastern University. He used a substance called polyhydroxyalkanoate, a biopolymer derived from the fermentation of canola oil. PHA biodegrades in ocean, leaving only water and carbon dioxide. His findings were published last year.


The coral cage consists of a limestone disc surrounded by eight vertical phade brand drinking straws, made by Atlanta-based WinCup Inc. The device doesn't have a top, Pisano said, because the juvenile coral needs sunlight and the parrot fish don't generally want to position themselves facing downward to eat.


Dotson, a retired aerospace engineer, met Pisano through his professor at Nova Southeastern, and the two formed Reef Fortify Inc. to further develop and market the patent-pending Coral Fort. The first batch of cages were priced at $12 each, but Pisano and Dotson believe that could change as production scales up.


Early prototypes of the cage made from phade's standard drinking straws were able to protect the coral for about two months before dissolving in the ocean, but that wasn't quite long enough to outlast the interest of parrot fish. When Pisano and Dotson reached out to phade for help, the company assured them that it could make virtually any custom shape from its biodegradable PHA material.


"But it's turning out that the boba straws, straight out of the box, work just fine," Dotson said.


Boba straws are wider and thicker than normal drinking straws. They're used for a tea-based drink that includes tapioca balls at the bottom of the cup. For Pisano and Dotson, that extra thickness means the straws last just long enough to protect the growing coral before harmlessly disappearing.


Reef Fortify is hoping to work with reef restoration projects all over the world. The Coral Forts already already being used by researchers at Nova Southeastern and the University of Miami, as well as Hawaii's Division of Aquatic Resources.


Rich Karp, a coral researcher at the University of Miami, said they've been using the Coral Forts for about a month. He pointed out that doing any work underwater takes a great deal of time and effort, so having a protective cage that dissolves when it's no longer needed basically cuts their work in half.


"Simply caging corals and then removing the cages later, that's two times the amount of work, two times the amount of bottom time," Karp said. "And it's not really scalable."


Experts say coral reefs are a significant part of the oceanic ecosystem. They occupy less than 1% of the ocean worldwide but provide food and shelter to nearly 25 percent of sea life. Coral reefs also help to protect humans and their homes along the coastline from storm surges during hurricanes.

## Lately

date: 2024-04-11, from: Rachel Kwon blog

I&rsquo;ve been a little less online lately, but not to worry, I have just been living my life :)
Several weeks ago, I gave notice at work and left. Some people in my life were surprised, because it was a good job at a good company, I generally enjoyed it, I got to work with wonderful people, and I was paid money to do it. The younger version of me who hadn&rsquo;t yet figured out a career direction would be curious (and more than a little skeptical) about why I would quit such an objectively good job.

## New York appeals court rejects Donald Trump’s third request to delay Monday's hush money trial

date: 2024-04-11, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Donald Trump is now 0 for 3 in last-minute attempts to get a New York appeals court to delay his looming hush money criminal trial. An appeals court judge Wednesday swiftly rejected the latest salvo from the former president’s lawyers, who argued he should be on the campaign trail rather than “in a courtroom defending himself” starting next week.


Trump's lawyers had asked the state’s mid-level appeals court to halt the case indefinitely while they fight to remove the trial judge and challenge several of his pretrial rulings, which they argue have seriously hindered the presumptive Republican nominee's defense.


Justice Ellen Gesmer’s ruling, after a third straight day of emergency hearings on Trump’s delay requests, was yet another loss for Trump, who has tried repeatedly to get the trial postponed. Barring further court action, the ruling clears the way for jury selection to begin next Monday.




“We’re here for this stay because there are restrictions in place that cannot operate in a constitutional way in a trial environment,” Trump lawyer Emil Bove argued at the hearing, which was held in a court basement lobby because the regular courtroom was in use.


“It’s an incredibly important trial. It’s a historic, unprecedented proceeding,” Bove said, adding: “This can only be done once, and it must be done right.”


Trump’s hush-money case is the first of his four criminal indictments slated to go to trial and would be the first criminal trial ever of a former president.


Adding to a litany of complaints registered this week with the appeals court, Bove argued that trial Judge Juan Merchan “exceeded his authority” in refusing to postpone the case until the Supreme Court rules on an immunity claim Trump raised in another of his criminal cases. Trump's lawyers argue some evidence in the hush-money case could be excluded if the Supreme Court rules in his favor.


Merchan last week declared that request untimely, ruling that Trump’s lawyers had “myriad opportunities” to raise the immunity issue before they finally did so in March, well after a deadline for pretrial motions had passed.


Steven Wu, the appellate chief for the Manhattan district attorney’s office, echoed that sentiment at Wednesday’s emergency hearing. He argued that Trump's lawyers had months to raise immunity and other issues and should not be rewarded with a delay at the eleventh hour.


“Staying the trial at this point would be incredibly disruptive,” Wu said. “The court, the people, witnesses have made extraordinary efforts to make sure this trial can take place on Monday.”


“There’s a powerful public interest to ensure this criminal trial goes forward,” he added.


Gesmer presided over the emergency hearing from an armchair, facing a hodgepodge of wooden seats, a collapsable table and a restroom.


Trump is accused of falsifying his company’s records to hide the nature of payments to his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who helped Trump bury negative stories during his 2016 campaign. Cohen’s activities included paying porn actor Stormy Daniels $130,000 to suppress her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump years earlier.


Trump pleaded not guilty last year to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He has denied having a sexual encounter with Daniels. His lawyers argue the payments to Cohen were legitimate legal expenses.


Trump already struck out twice this week with the appeals court. One appeals court judge Monday rejected his bid to delay the trial while he seeks to move it out of Manhattan. A different judge on Tuesday denied a request, framed as part of a lawsuit against Merchan, that the trial be delayed while Trump fights a gag order imposed on him in recent weeks.


Trump's lawyers had asked Merchan last month to adjourn the New York trial indefinitely until Trump’s immunity claim in his Washington, D.C., election interference case is resolved.


Trump contends he is immune from prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office. His lawyers have not raised that as a defense in the hush-money case, but they argued that some evidence — including Trump’s social media posts about former lawyer Cohen — is from his time as president and should be excluded from the trial because of his immunity protections.


The Supreme Court is to hear arguments in that matter on April 25.


"This is a situation where a judge has exceeded his authority under circumstances with very, very serious federalism implications,” Bove argued at Wednesday's emergency hearing.


Trump's lawyers also renewed their argument that Merchan should step aside from the case. They've accused him of bias and a conflict of interest, citing his daughter’s work as the head of a firm whose clients have included President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats.


Trump's lawyers filed a formal recusal request with Merchan last week. The judge rejected a similar request in August and has not ruled on Trump’s pending request. The judge has also yet to rule on another defense delay request, which claims that Trump won’t get a fair trial because of “prejudicial media coverage.”


“Their recusal arguments are completely meritless," Wu argued.


Trump's lawyers also took issue with a protocol Merchan put in place last month to manage a flood of last-minute court filings. And they revisited their complaints — aired at an emergency hearing Tuesday — about the gag order Merchan imposed on Trump last month that bars him from making public comments about witnesses, jurors and others regarding their connections to the case.


Trump’s ability to campaign "is something that’s protected under the First Amendment, for President Trump and the American people,” Bove argued.

## Me and FSD

date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Check out my <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/04/09/160339.html">political preamble</a> on Tesla, X and Musk. </p>
<p>One more disclaimer: I love my Tesla Model Y. Best car ever. I've been driving a Tesla since late 2021, and I still feel privileged to drive the car every time I do. It's the Macintosh of cars.</p>
<p>I don't generally use <a href="https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/modely/en_us/GUID-2CB60804-9CEA-4F4B-8B04-09B991368DC5.html">FSD</a>, even though I paid for it and have had it available all the time I've driven a Tesla.</p>
<p>They say you should always be fully attentive when using FSD. I am always <i>soooo</i> ready to take over for it. I don't trust it. And I also don't feel that when I'm in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-knuckle">white-knuckle</a> mode when it's driving, that my reflexes are anywhere near as good as the reflexes I have when I'm driving, with fifty years of experience, and maybe a few hours of experience supervising a FSD car. I don't have a sense of how to work with it. So I err on the side of turning it off whenever I feel like even slightly scared. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/10/trumpBeingCarriedAway.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I also don't like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_coaster">roller coasters</a>, but if I did, I'd recognize that this is different. A roller coaster is designed to give the exact same experience to every user every time. It's designed to give the impression that your life is about to end, using gravity and eyesight and all that evolution trained you to be scared of. It fools you into being scared, when you're actually safe. Every so often you read about someone dying on a rollercoaster. That probably improves the fun for thrill-seekers, and gives people like me justification for staying away. People also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungee_jumping">bungee jump</a> knowing there's a chance the chord could break, but they know it's not going to. </p>
<p>None of that is true for the Tesla. It's making it up as it goes along. And it definitely encounters situations it can't handle, or it misinterprets a set of obvious facts, or even worse it hallucinates just like ChatGPT.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Lake+Katrine,+New+York/Woodstock,+NY/@41.9949908,-74.0943946,13z/data=!4m19!4m18!1m10!1m1!1s0x89dd05c97bfa4075:0xbf2d119b7e29d940!2m2!1d-73.9881934!2d41.9856476!3m4!1m2!1d-74.0796429!2d41.972964!3s0x89dd042d11d4346d:0xbe2f0b18a2064238!1m5!1m1!1s0x89dd0733c0cf4c2b:0xb85cbeef880771fc!2m2!1d-74.1181971!2d42.0409247!3e0?entry=ttu">driving</a> from Lake Katrine to Woodstock with FSD, and it was doing really well, up to a point. First I was on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_28">Route 28</a>, a four-lane road, for about five miles, it <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@41.9972259,-74.1046808,3a,75y,343.4h,68.85t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1srkTm7bYH3qW0CqLfUyT18w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">turned</a> onto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_State_Route_375">375</a> which is a curvy two-lane road.

A busy <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.0369198,-74.1109242,3a,75y,19.14h,83.49t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJbEh3c4hgugNZsCx4uUtZw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu">intersection</a>. Traffic coming from the left and right, and many are turning onto the road I'm on. I watched in awe as FSD tried to find a way to make a left turn in this complicated situation, starting, stopping, it tried, found itself out in traffic, and got stuck there. I had enough and took over. Luckily the car waiting behind us had left a little room. I've dealt with this intersection probably a few hundred times in the last few years. I know the crazy things the other drivers do here, and I know to watch out for them. The Tesla didn't know.  </p>

## Why are we still suffering inflation? Monopoly power!

date: 2024-04-10, from: Robert Reich on Substack

Friends, We learned today that the Consumer Price Index climbed 3.5 percent in March from a year earlier, up from 3.2 percent in February, and faster than most economists anticipated. This poses a conundrum for central bankers who have made it clear that they want to see further evidence that inflation is cooling before they cut interest rates.

## The native app install experience

date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p><video controls preload="none" poster="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/download-app.jpg" src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/download-app.mp4"></video></p>
<p>At the end of each MSNBC YouTube video right now they have a 30 second post-roll of Ali Velshi explaining the 5-step process on how to install the new MSNBC app.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tap on the App Store on your phone</li>
<li>Hit “Search” on the bottom right corner</li>
<li>Type in “MSNBC”</li>
<li>Click on the MSNBC app</li>
<li>Click on “Get” or the cloud icon</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s an implied sixth step where you need to actually open the newly installed app. Opening the app for the first time you swipe through a little slideshow that has two more (optional) steps: give your email and turn on notifications. Standard engagement economy tactics.</p>
<p>Hearing the 5-step native app install process a few times a day makes me think we lost something along the way. Remember when the call to action was to visit a URL? Not only is “Visit msnbc.com” more succinct, catchier, private, less prone to user error, and immune to competitive advertisements but it also doesn’t require a paid presenter to coach you through it. Once upon a time users might have needed Ali Velshi’s help getting to a website, but in my experience visiting a website is one of the first computing skills my kids learned without my direct involvement. The URL isn’t a foreign concept anymore.</p>
<p>I know I’m making a mountain out of a “We just want to promote our new app, maaan” molehill here, but even saying “Visit msnbc.com/mobile” with a redirect to their <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/information/msnbc-info/download-msnbc-app-n1241692">actual app download page</a> would be easier. It boggles my mind why you’d push a clunky app store install flow over a five-letter domain name. I’d even bet $5 that the “native app” is actually a bunch of web views in a trench coat. In an even wilder twist, that app download page isn’t linked anywhere on the website! Ughck. I’m 0% invested on what’s happening over at MSNBC but I’m already getting whiffs of misaligned goals, interdepartmental strife, and poorly designed content management systems.</p>
<p>Anyways, websites. They’re old tech but still work great from time to time.</p>

## EU’s new tech laws are working; small mobile browsers gain market share

date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News

Independent browser companies in the European Union are seeing a spike in users in the first month after EU legislation forced Alphabet&#8217;s Google, Microsoft and Apple to make it easier for users to switch to rivals, according to data provided to Reuters by six companies. The early results come after the EU&#8217;s sweeping Digital Markets Act, which aims to remove unfair competition, took effect on March 7, forcing big tech companies to offer mobile users the ability to select from a list of available web browsers from a &#8220;choice screen.&#8221; ↫ Supantha Mukherjee and Foo Yun Chee I can&#8217;t believe this is even remotely surprising. A lot of especially Apple fans and people from outside of the European Union complained left, right, and centre about the choice screen and how it was ugly, unnecessary, and would just confuse users. These are interesting claims, considering the fact that setting up a modern smartphone such as the iPhone takes the user through 40-50 setup screens chockful of confusing choices to make, so adding one more surely wouldn&#8217;t make a difference. Of course giving users the option to choose a different default browser would lead to an increase in browsers other than Safari (iOS) or Chrome (Android) being set as the default. I&#8217;m pretty sure quite a few users learned, through the choice screen, for the first time, that there even are different browsers to choose from, and that some of those might offer features and benefits they didn&#8217;t even know they could enjoy. That&#8217;s the whole point of this endeavour: informing users that they have a choice, something Apple, Google, and others would rather you either do not have, or at least not know about. It&#8217;s far too early to tell if these spikes are a one-off thing, or if the rise in browsers other than Safari on iOS and Chrome on Android is more structural. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it&#8217;s the latter, and even if the numbers remain in the single digits or low double digits, it will still lead to an increase in competition, and a more vibrant mobile browser market. Good news, regardless.

## House lawmakers reject renewal of key US intelligence program

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

washington — U.S. House lawmakers rejected an attempt to reform a controversial foreign intelligence program Wednesday, the latest blow in Speaker Mike Johnson’s effort to lead a narrow Republican majority.


A renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, failed to advance, 228-193, following a warning from former President Donald Trump on TruthSocial.


Trump said that FISA “was illegally used against me, and many others. They spied on my campaign!!” he wrote, using all capital letters.


A Justice Department investigation found in 2019 that surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page continued for months after it should have ended.


The law — also referred to as Section 702 — allows U.S. intelligence agencies to collect data on foreigners overseas without obtaining a warrant. But it has received the most criticism for so-called “backdoor searches” that allow collection of U.S. citizens’ data. An attempted reform would have required the FBI to secure a warrant before collecting data.


“We’re enacting sweeping changes — 50 reforms, 56 to be exact — to the program that are in the base text that will stop the abuse of politicized FBI queries and prevent another Russia hoax debacle, among many other important reforms,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday morning. “No more of the intelligence community relying on fake news reports to order a FISA order, no more collusion.”



But Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene — who has filed a procedural motion to remove Johnson from the speakership — said those reforms were not enough.


“It's like asking the deep state to hold itself accountable,” Greene told reporters Wednesday. “The FBI is abusing American people's trust. The [Justice Department] has abused the American people's trust. So, this doesn't give me confidence that it will stop it.”


Nineteen House Republicans voted against the bill. Democrats said Wednesday that the proposed FISA reforms had not secured their votes.


“Whatever the vote count is, or whatever happens to that, it's because the speaker has chosen not to advance this issue in a single standalone process. If he chooses to go a different route, then we'll reassess,” Representative Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, said Wednesday morning.


An attempt to pass surveillance laws failed in December when House leadership pulled a vote amid internal Republican divisions.


Johnson argued to colleagues in a letter on Friday that the law would “establish new procedures to rein in the FBI, increase accountability at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISC, impose penalties for wrongdoing, and institute unprecedented transparency across the FISA process so we no longer have to wait years to uncover potential abuses.”


Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, warned against some of the proposed changes in a speech Tuesday to the American Bar Association.


"Bottom line, a warrant requirement would be the equivalent of rebuilding the pre-9/11 intelligence 'wall,' " he said in his prepared remarks. "As the threats to our homeland continue to evolve, the agility and effectiveness of 702 will be essential to the FBI’s ability — and really our mandate from the American people — to keep them safe for years to come.”


Unless Congress acts, authorization for the program expires on April 19.


Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.

## Microsoft details new features coming in Windows Server 2025

date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News

Microsoft recently held a streaming event in which it detailed a lot of the new features and changes coming in Windows server 2025, and has now followed that up with a blog post, as well. There&#8217;s a lot to go over here, and I&#8217;m anything but a Windows Server specialist, so I&#8217;ll highlight some of the thing I&#8217;m certain will be welcomed by Windows Server administrators. First and foremost, the biggest improvement: hot-patching. Security updates can be installed without having to reboot, because Server 2025 will modify code in memory without restarting the processes in question. Quarterly updates, however, will still require reboots. Hot-patching will be free on all versions of Server 2025. Microsoft also promises a massive performance boost for NVMe drives &#8211; the company claims a 70% improvement going from Server 2022 to Server 2025. Microsoft&#8217;s other file system, ReFS, is also seeing improvements, and Storage Replica&#8217;s compression will be available in all editions of Windows Server 2025. A major improvement in Hyper-V is the ability to partition GPUs, so you can use one GPU to power multiple virtual machines. As far as licensing goes, the most important news here is that you&#8217;ll still be able to buy a normal, regular, run-of-the-mill perpetual license for Windows Server 2025, so even though there&#8217;s various more &#8216;modern&#8217; options, you can also just opt for the way it&#8217;s always been.

## Think diplomacy is tough? Try a White House state dinner

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

the white house — Preparations take months. No detail is overlooked, for this is perhaps the most evolved form of diplomacy: the state dinner.


As first lady Jill Biden prepared Wednesday to host her fifth state dinner, for Japan's leader, she made sure that every aesthetic detail — the crystal on the tables, the food on the White House china, the decor in the State Dining Room, the music and the fashion — dripped with diplomatic significance. This dinner, she said in her preview of the event, would make frequent reference to Washington's famous cherry trees, a gift from Japan more than a century ago.


"As guests sit among the field of flowers, glass and silk butterflies from both our countries will dance over the tables, their graceful flight a reminder that as our nations navigate the winds of change, we do so together as partners in peace and prosperity," she said.


The White House Historical Association laid out the high stakes, saying a state dinner "showcases global power and influence and sets the tone for the continuation of dialogue between the president and the visiting head of state."  




Roxanne Roberts, a style writer for The Washington Post who has covered state dinners for more than 30 years, likens them to "the frosting on an already-baked cake."


"The state dinner is the least important part of a state visit, but it's the thing that gets the most attention," she told VOA. "And it sends a signal to not only the government of that country but the people of that country that you're important to us. We care about you."


That's reflected in the numbers. Records that journalists requested from the State Department, which foots the bill, show that Obama-era dinners cost U.S. taxpayers more than half a million dollars each. More recent dinner tabs have not been released.


The food!


Imagine, Roberts said, a lavish wedding.


"It's as if there was a marriage between the two countries, and this is the wedding reception," she said.




The most obvious manifestation of that is on the plate.


White House executive chef Cristeta Comerford said this menu took her "a couple of months" to design and field test. Over three courses, guests took a tour through her Japan-influenced creations, starting with a nod to the beloved American twist on sushi, the California roll. Her version was rendered as a salad of house-cured salmon with avocado, grapefruit, watermelon radish, cucumber and shiso leaf fritters.


Beef has been a fixture of past Biden dinners — the exception, of course, being the menu for the 2023 state dinner for Indian leader Narendra Modi, a strict vegetarian. Guests at this year's dinner, accordingly, moved on to a dry-aged rib-eye steak with blistered shishito pepper butter; a fricassee of fava beans, morels and cipollini mushrooms; and a sesame oil sabayon.


And for dessert: a salted caramel pistachio cake with matcha tea ganache, cherry ice cream and a drizzle of raspberry coulis.


"We wanted to bring a little bit of the cherry blossoms that are here on the Tidal Basin right here to our dessert, in order for everyone to enjoy the cherry blossoms that we enjoy every year," said White House executive pastry chef Susie Morrison.


The wines, as is now custom, will be American.


"The days when only French wines were served at state dinners are long gone," Roberts said. "Primarily because there were a lot of American vineyards who basically said, 'Whoa, what about us? We're cool.'" 




The fripperies!


A temporary installation in the White House's Cross Hall featured swimming koi – "symbols of friendship, peace, luck and perseverance," Biden said.


In the Bookseller’s Hall arrival area, a massive vinyl floor decal with images of cherry blossoms, butterflies and koi was laid over the marble flooring, as guests strolled in — including former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, gold-medal figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi, Biden family members and actor Robert DeNiro. Dresses bore floral motifs, lace and long hems. One guest wore a formal montsuki, a version of a kimono.


Musical entertainment featured Paul Simon, a favorite of the first lady. And the first couples exchanged gifts that included a three-legged black walnut table made by a Japanese-American-owned company, a set of records autographed by American singer Billy Joel, and, as a personal touch, a framed painting of the Yoshino cherry tree that Jill Biden planted with Japan's first lady, Yuko Kishida, on the South Lawn last spring.


The fashion!


Yuko Kishida had garnered rave reviews for her choice to don India's most culturally and technically fraught of garments, the sari, by draping and meticulously pleating 5 meters of green Kanjeevaram silk around her body for a summit of global leaders last year in New Delhi.


As she landed in Washington for her first state visit on Tuesday — but her second trip to meet the Bidens — she greeted the couple in a flowing dress of autumn-toned watercolor florals. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida wore suits, while the U.S. first lady donned a black dress with a deep keyhole neckline and razor-sharp tailoring.  




For the main event, the first ladies coordinated in shades of deep, purple-toned blue, with Biden in a long-sleeved floor-length beaded gown in what the White House described as "sapphire ombre" made by the house of Dominican-born American designer Oscar de la Renta.


The Japanese first lady donned a silky blue gown with exaggerated shoulders and black beaded floral embellishments along the neckline. The dress was cinched with a black belt, evoking the sash traditionally used to secure a kimono.


These decisions, Roberts said, are "more than just going off to the store and going, 'Oh, that's pretty. I think I'll wear that.'"


And the pressure, she said, falls disproportionately on the leaders' spouses, who are traditionally women.


"They're ambassadors for the clothing that they wear, the look that they have," she said. "And so, all of those, all of those elements play into all of these choices. You know, the guys have it easy — just throw on the tuxedo."


... And finally, the faux pas!


What could possibly go wrong?  




Surprisingly, not a lot, Roberts said, adding, "The truth of the matter is that these state dinners tend to go off without a hitch, because the planning is done so well."


But, she said, mistakes sometimes happen.


She described a long-ago dinner for Mexico's leader that featured "an elaborate dessert that had a guy with a sombrero sleeping as a decorative piece."


"It was meant to be charming and kind of fun, and it just hit wrong," she said.


Another memorable slip, she said, was at a 2009 state dinner for India, where two uninvited reality stars crashed the event.


"The fact that two people were able to get in who were not supposed to be there was, in fact, a scandal," she said.


The East Wing, in its preview, chose to focus instead on the positive, with White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo homing in on the theme while raising the stakes of this impossibly complex event.


"That's what we hope to capture," he said. "The magic of spring in our lasting friendship, each detail chosen to create a once-in-a-lifetime experience."

Growing military and economic ties between Russia and Iran pose a threat to U.S. and Western interests. But their relationship remains largely transactional. The Ukraine war has incentivized them to paper over their disputes for now, but has not erased significant differences which make it more difficult for Moscow and Tehran to forge a true strategic partnership.

## Top US general warns Ukraine on brink of being overrun by Russia

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The tenacity of Ukrainian troops will soon be no match for Russia’s manpower and missiles should U.S. lawmakers fail to approve additional security assistance for Ukraine, the top American general in Europe told lawmakers, part of a stark warning about the direction of the more than two-year-old conflict.


U.S. military officials have warned repeatedly in recent weeks that Russian forces have been able to make incremental gains in Ukraine and that without renewed U.S. backing, Ukraine’s forces will eventually falter.


Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday, the commander of U.S. European Command described the battlefield in blunt terms.


"If we do not continue to support Ukraine, Ukraine will run out of artillery shells and will run out of air defense interceptors in fairly short order,” said General Christopher Cavoli, explaining that Kyiv is dependent on the United States for those key munitions.


"I can't predict the future, but I can do simple math,” he said. "Based on my experience in 37-plus years in the U.S. military, if one side can shoot and the other side can't shoot back, the side that can't shoot back loses."


Cavoli also said the failure of U.S. lawmakers to approve a $60 billion supplemental security package is already giving Russia a significant advantage.


"They [Ukraine] are now being outshot by the Russian side 5-to-1," he told lawmakers. “That will immediately go to 10-to-1 in a matter of weeks.


“We are not talking about months. We are not talking hypothetically,” Cavoli said.




Multiple U.S. officials have warned that Ukraine’s military has been forced to ration artillery and air defense capabilities as Kyiv waits for U.S. lawmakers to approve the supplemental assistance.


“We are already seeing the effects of the failure to pass the supplemental,” Assistant Secretary of Defense Celeste Wallander told the panel, testifying alongside U.S. European Command’s Cavoli.


“We don’t need to imagine,” she said, blaming the lack of U.S. provided artillery for why “the Russian attacks are getting through.”


That supplemental defense package passed in the U.S. Senate back in February, but leadership in the House of Representatives has so far refused to bring the legislation to the floor for a vote.


During a press conference on Capitol Hill Wednesday, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said lawmakers were continuing to “actively discuss our options on a path forward.”


“It’s a very complicated matter at a very complicated time. The clock is ticking on it, and everyone here feels the urgency of that,” Johnson said. “But what’s required is that you reach consensus on it, and that’s what we’re working on.”


House Democrats, however, have voiced frustration with Johnson’s refusal to call a vote.


“The House has waited months now to approve the security package to help protect Ukraine,” said Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. “Weeks ago, we were too late. And now every day is at an extreme cost to our ability to deter Russia.”


Another Democrat on the committee, Representative Elissa Slotkin, scolded Johnson, saying he needs to call a vote despite opposition from a small group of House Republicans.


“We do need to get it over the finish line,” she said. “I accept that he’s at risk of losing his job over that choice, but that’s what leadership is — it’s the big boy pants and making tough choices.”


Some Republicans, though, chastised Democratic lawmakers for what they described as misguided priorities.


"We’ve got hundreds of thousands of Americans who are dying, fentanyl overdoses, child and human sex trafficking, not to mention 178-plus countries that are crossing our border,” said Republican Representative Cory Mills.


“But, oh wait, that’s not the priority. Let’s secure Ukraine’s borders,” he said.


VOA’s Katherine Gypson contributed to this report.

## A weighted vest

date: 2024-04-10, from: Dave Rupert blog

<picture style="margin-inline: auto">
  <source srcset="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/vest-dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
  <img alt="Illustration of a large round man with a tiny vest in the middle of his chest" src="https://cdn.daverupert.com/posts/2024/vest.svg" width="461" height="429" >
</picture>
<p>I bought <a href="https://amzn.to/3xsz1Xj">a 40 pound weighted vest for $40 dollars on Amazon</a>. The workout term for this is “rucking” and has connotations with being outdoorsy and/or in the military. Load up a backpack full of weights (or in my case, a vest full of sand bags) and head outdoors. The <a href="https://www.goruck.com/pages/what-is-rucking">marketing benefits</a> of rucking sound great:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is simple and anyone can do it</li>
<li>Gets you outside</li>
<li>Active Resistance Training™️</li>
<li>Burns up to 3x more calories than walking</li>
<li>Good for your back and improves your posture</li>
<li>Good for your mental health</li>
</ul>
<p>A neighbor friend of mine (that’s also a physical therapist) has one and she recommended it.  My body is adept at carrying heavy objects<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>, so this seems like an easy way to squeeze out some gains from my regular walks. Bonus points that it gets me outside and gets rid of my developer hunch. After a handful of walks, I’m enjoying the vest and –as expected– my body handles the weight fine but it’s sweatier and hills knock the wind out of me a bit more.</p>
<p>There’s an army fetish around rucking. It’s hard to tell if that’s fragile male ego in workout culture or if it’s because an armored plate carrier is a well-tested and efficient way to carry weight. My vest doesn’t look that masculine and looks more like I duct taped C4 to my chest. With my uni-bomber glasses, long hair, beard, and resting scowl I don’t need more help looking like a disgruntled domestic terrorist but I suppose this completes the look. If I can sustain <a href="/2021/06/two-options/">the $40 fix</a>, then I’ll upgrade to the $200 plate vest solution.</p>
<p>The cynical side of me wonders if this is more skinny people shit. As I dawn the weighted vest, the irony is not lost on me I used to be about the same amount of weight heavier. Being heavy never helped me lose weight. No one gives you an approving head nod for walking while fat, but velcro a little vest to your torso and people give you the “good for you” pity eyes.</p>
<p>Putting my optimist hat back on, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Po4adxJxqZk">it might work this time</a>. Maybe this is the one weird trick my body needs to activate dormant caveman genetics that will unleash my inner Adonis. Walking in hard mode seems sustainable for the time-being and I can already feel my ass morphing into a perfect badonkadonk.</p>

## Putin's Cordon Sanitaire in Ukraine

date: 2024-04-10, updated: 2024-04-10, from: RAND blog

Moscow is signaling a renewed Russian lunge into northern Ukraine to create a buffer zone and seize Kharkiv. Any Russian escalation in northern Ukraine deserves to be met with the full force of Ukraine's own arms and those from the West.

## Trump says Arizona's abortion ban goes 'too far,' defends overturning of Roe v. Wade

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA — Donald Trump said Wednesday that an Arizona law that criminalizes nearly all abortions goes too far and called on Arizona lawmakers to change it, while also defending the overturning of Roe v. Wade that cleared states to ban the procedure. 


"It'll be straightened out and as you know, it's all about states' rights," the former president told supporters and journalists after landing in Atlanta for a fundraiser. "It'll be straightened out, and I'm sure that the governor and everybody else are going to bring it back into reason and that'll be taken care of, I think, very quickly." 


Though Trump has waffled on whether he supports abortion rights, he appointed three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a federally guaranteed right to abortion. Now facing growing political backlash as Democrats notch victories around the nation by campaigning on abortion rights, Trump increasingly has been put on the defensive and urged Republicans to avoid supporting bans that are unpopular with many Americans. 


Trump issued a video statement this week declining to endorse a national abortion ban and saying he believes limits should be left to the states. His statement angered some religious conservatives and energized allies of President Joe Biden who see abortion rights as one of Trump's weaknesses. 




The Arizona Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday cleared the way for the enforcement of an 1864 law that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape or incest and allows abortions only if the mother's life is in jeopardy. 


Biden called the 1864 Arizona law cruel. 


"Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban, which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic cases of rape or incest," he said in a statement. "Vice President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman's right to choose. We will continue to fight to protect reproductive rights and call on Congress to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe v. Wade." 


The decision drastically altered Arizona's legal landscape for terminating pregnancies. The court suggested doctors can be prosecuted under the Civil War-era law, though the opinion written by the court's majority did not say that. 


Trump maintains he is proud that the three Supreme Court justices he nominated voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, saying states will have different restrictions. He supports three exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. 


He also spoke about a Florida law that bans abortions after six weeks, saying that "is probably maybe going to change also." Last week, the state Supreme Court upheld the state's ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy and the ruling also clears the way for the state to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. 


"For 52 years, people have wanted to end Roe v. Wade, to get it back to the states. We did that. It was an incredible thing, an incredible achievement," he said. "Now the states have it, and the states are putting out what they want. It's the will of the people. So Florida is probably going to change." 


Trump ignored questions about how he plans to vote himself on Florida's pending state constitutional amendment that would enshrine abortion access as a right of his home state's residents. He did not elaborate on what he thinks the level of restrictions and access should be in Arizona or any other state.

I finally managed to log in, but that doesn't help. They have all kinds of links that say click here to pay the thing you want to pay, and that just takes me to a login page where it says someone with that email address already has an account, which I knew because I'm already logged in using that account. The IRS site was a comparative breeze, even though it had its own mysteries to solve and a certain amount of luck was required to be allowed to pay my freaking taxes. I think when Reagan said the government was the problem this is one of the times he was right about that.

## Maldives 2024

date: 2024-04-10, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="maldives-2024">Maldives 2024</h1>

<p>The biosphere as we know it is ending and I’m spending two weeks in the Maldives with my wife for her 50th birthday. I feel conflicted.</p>

<p>The trip to get here was long. Zurich Doha by plane, Doha Male by plane, Male Kurudu by water-plane, Kurudu Komandoo by speedboat. I felt like sleeping for 20h when we finally got here. And all the <a href="2024-04-05-travel">anxiety before leaving</a> was terrible, too.</p>

<p>With that, I think we have all out must-see locations before the end. We went to the <a href="2017-10-28_Australia">Great Barrier Reef</a> in 2017, to the <a href="Galapagos_2020">Galapagos</a> in 2020 and now to the Maldives.</p>

<p><a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Pictures">#Pictures</a> <a class="tag" href="/search/?q=%23Maldives">#Maldives</a></p>

<p><strong>2024-04-06</strong>.
The last leg of the journey – our water-plane was delayed because of the bad weather.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking out from the porch the ocean is blue, the sky is blue and the reef begins a few meters in.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-5.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We go snorkeling every day. Our last two trips showed me that we need an underwater camera. Oh to have videos of Reef Number Nine in Australia or the penguins and sea lions in the Galapagos! I bought a GoPro Hero 10 before we left.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This cowtail stingray (?) we keep seeing is about 2m long and likes to hide in the sand.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There’s sea grass sprouting right now and sea turtles grazing.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Black tipped reef sharks… harmless! At a later point we did see it attack something hidden in the rocks and it was scary to see!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-6.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most corals look dreary! It’s certainly not as colourful and busy as in Australia or the Galapagos.
This purple giant is cool, though.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-7.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There are still plenty of colourful fish.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-8.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Whenever we’re away on a trip, we play games.
The most popular tropical island game is Race for the Galaxy.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-9.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday we also played <a href="http://mixedsignals.ml/games/petition/">Petition</a> by <a class="account" href="https://mastodon.xyz/@klaatu" title="@klaatu@mastodon.xyz">@klaatu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>2024-04-10</strong>. More pictures.</p>

<p>We saw our first hermit crabs in Costa Rica where we spent our honey moon. We love these little ones. Maybe because they’re slow and easily scared and therefore obviously harmless.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-10.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The parrot fish have super sharp teeth and gnaw on the corals. And when you’re snorkeling, you can hear them. Kchrrr! Kchhhrrk!</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-11.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I also love those lone corals harbouring a small school of tiny fearful fish that retreat and hide in the coral as somebody approaches.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="2024-04-06-maledives-12.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>When you swim past the nearby reef the bottom drops out and the deep blue begins. I am always afraid some huge fish will show up.</p>

</video>

<p>There is a strange tourism industry, here. The islands are either uninhabited, inhabited by locals, or reserved for tourism. Tourists can stay on the “local islands” since 2007. Natives are only allowed to work on the tourist islands.</p>

<p>The capital city is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density">one of the densest urban areas</a> on the planet. Just look at the image of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%C3%A9">Malé on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>I would lament this urban sprawl, the land reclamation, the garbage problem, the democracy deficit, the dependence on tourism – but I know what my friend Peter would say, pointing at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factfulness">Factfulness</a> book. Check out these stats from the <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malediven">German Wikipedia page on the Maldives</a>:
In 2020, the Maldives had 541000 inhabitants.
In 1950, they had about 74000 inhabitants. At the time, a woman had about 7.5 children on average in 1980 but these days they are so much better off that the growth rate has dropped to 1.8% in 2020 and a woman has about 1.8 children on average. Life expectancy rose from 34.5 years in 1950 to 81 for women and 77.8 for men in 2020. An amazing improvement from the point of view of the locals.</p>

<p>From my green perspective, though… let’s not forget the garbage island <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi">Thilafushi</a>. The picked an island and use it as a garbage dump because they don&rsquo;t know what to do with all the garbage. Sure, every island needs a garbage incinerator now, but in the nineties, there was just garbage and it had to go somewhere. And some of the stuff starts leaking. It accumulates in the the fish. People eat the fish. It&rsquo;s easy to feel grim about this. I need to remind myself that life expectancy was less than 35 years just a generation or two ago (I was born in the seventies). Poverty is much, much worse than pollution and we tend to forget it.</p>

<p>If you’re wondering why I’m basically skimming, reading and finally summarizing Wikipedia articles on my blog, I guess the answer is that this is how I try to deal with it all. To not close my eyes. Not to look away.</p>

## US restricts trade with companies tied to drones used by Russia, Houthis

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States restricted trade with five companies on Wednesday that it said help produce and procure drones for use by Russia in Ukraine and by Iran-backed Houthis in Red Sea shipping attacks. 


The companies from Russia and China were among 11 additions to the Commerce Department's Entity List, which means suppliers need licenses before shipping goods and technology to them. 


Russia has intensified its drone and missile strikes against Ukrainian energy facilities in recent weeks, causing significant damage and threatening a repeat of the blackouts experienced in the first year after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. 


The Commerce Department added a Chinese entity, Jiangxi Xintuo Enterprise Company, for supporting Russia's military through the procurement, development and proliferation of Russian drones, it said.


Shenzhen Jiasibo Technology Company of China was cited for being part of a network procuring aerospace components, including drone applications, for an aircraft company in Iran. Three Russian entities — Aerosila JSC SPE, Delta-Aero LLC, and JSC ODK-Star — were added for being part of the network. 


"These components are used to develop and produce Shahed-series UAVs which have been used by Iran to attack oil tankers in the Middle East and by Russia in Ukraine," the Federal Register notice said, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles. 


Attacks on ships, including oil tankers, by Iranian-backed Houthis have disrupted global shipping through the Red Sea. Yemen's Houthi militia say they are retaliating against Israel's war against Palestinian Hamas militants in Gaza. 


Companies are added to the U.S. Entity List when Washington deems them a threat to U.S. national security or foreign policy. Suppliers must then be granted licenses, which are likely to be denied, before shipping goods to entities on the list. 


The two United Arab Emirates citations, Khalaj Trading LLC and Mahdi Khalaj Amirhosseini, were added for apparently violating Iran sanctions by exporting or trying to export items from the United States to Iran through UAE, according to the posting. 


Four Chinese entities were cited for acquiring U.S. items to support China's military modernization efforts, it said. They are LINKZOL (Beijing) Technology Company, Xi’an Like Innovative Information Technology Company, Beijing Anwise Technology Company and Sitonholy (Tianjin) Company. 


U.S.-Chinese military contacts resumed late last year, but tensions continue due to fundamental differences over Taiwan and the South China Sea that remain dangerous potential flashpoints.  


Chinese leader Xi Jinping has pumped billions into buying and developing equipment as part of his modernizing efforts to build a "world-class" military by 2050, with Beijing's outsized defense budget growing at a faster pace than the economy for some years.

## Colorado reporter's expulsion from Republican gathering causes uproar

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

DENVER, COLORADO — Politicians and news outlets in Colorado expressed anger over the expulsion from a Republican gathering this past weekend of an experienced politics reporter who was told that the state party chairman "believes current reporting to be very unfair." 


Journalists and prominent politicians, including the former chair of the Colorado Republican Party, came to the defense of Colorado Sun reporter Sandra Fish and against current state Republican Chairman Dave Williams, who said he had "no apologies" for ejecting Fish. 


The controversy follows the contours of attacks on the press nationally, partly brought on by former President Donald Trump with the popularization of the term "fake news." The ejection also appears to have influenced an endorsement Monday in the Republican primary race. 


The state Republican Party announced on the social media platform X that it was endorsing U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert over one of her primary opponent, Deborah Flora, in the state's 4th Congressional District race, partly because "Deb Flora lied about participating in the CD4 Assembly process, & now she's boot licking fake journalists who only help Democrats." 


The post was a direct reply to Flora's post on X defending Fish, in which Flora said the expulsion was "wrong and a violation of the First Amendment." 


The chair, who introduces himself on the party’s website as "Dave 'Let's Go Brandon' Williams," is seeking the nomination to run for the 5th District seat held by Republican U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, who is retiring from Congress. 


In a text, Williams said he had no apologies for kicking Fish out of the assembly in Pueblo on Saturday and accused her of being a "fake journalist" and The Colorado Sun of being biased. When asked by text for examples, Williams did not respond. The Colorado Sun is an independent, nonprofit and nonpartisan news outlet that covers Colorado. 


"I invite anyone to share any example of The Colorado Sun or Sandra Fish being unfair or inaccurate. So far I have heard nothing," said Larry Ryckman, editor of the news outlet. "The Founding Fathers weren't any big fans of newspapers back in the day. But they understood that a healthy democracy demands free, unfettered press." 


The assembly, held about two hours south of Denver, was partly to select representatives to the Republican National Committee and to work on a party platform for the election. 


"There are 900,000 Republicans in the state of Colorado and a lot of unaffiliated voters who are interested in what happens at this assembly. And how they find out is via reporters like me being there to cover it," Fish told The Associated Press by phone Monday. 


"I am, as one person on Twitter noted, a little old lady and I've been in this business for a long time, and I just don't think it's right to eject a reporter from a meeting like this," said Fish, who has covered politics since 1982. 


Fish said she heard rumors prior to the event that she'd be barred from attending, and she asked event organizer, Eric Grossman, who texted her Thursday that he'd get back to her. 


"Thanks. I've been covering these assemblies for at least seven cycles and have never had issues before," Fish texted back. Ryckman attempted to reach Williams on Thursday night to discuss but said Williams never responded. 


Before dawn on Saturday, Grossman texted Fish saying she wouldn't be included on the press list and that "the state chairman believes current reporting to be very unfair." 


"I went anyway because, come on, this should be an open event," said Fish, who was checked in and given press credentials that she wore around her neck along with a Colorado Sun nametag. 


About an hour later, security asked her to leave. Fish showed her press credentials, then Grossman arrived and soon a sheriff's deputy was called. Fish left with the deputy. 


"We make no apologies for kicking out a fake journalist, who actually snuck into our event," Williams said in a text. "Her publication is just an extension of the Democrat Party's PR efforts, and the only backlash we see is from the fake news media, radical Democrats, and establishment RINOs who hate our conservative base." 


Grossman, in a text, said Fish's actions were "a selfish political stunt." 


Republican state Senator Barbara Kirkmeyer defended the reporter, writing in a post on X: "Sandra Fish is a fair; honest and respected reporter, as a Republican I'm embarrassed by the GOP chair." 




Former Colorado Republican Party chair Kristi Burton Brown also chimed in on X, describing Fish as "hard-hitting but fair. ... This is a dangerous take by the current (Colorado GOP). ... Transparency is necessary for our nation." 


Among other stories, Fish has reported on how the Colorado Republican Party under Williams' leadership paid for mailers that subtly attacked one of Williams' primary opponents, and that fundraising slowed under his chairmanship.

## Trump ex-deputy Weisselberg sentenced to five months for perjury

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

New York — Former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was sentenced on Wednesday to five months in jail after pleading guilty last month to perjury charges for lying to investigators and a judge about Donald Trump's finances.


Judge Laurie Peterson handed down the sentence at a hearing in Manhattan criminal court. The sentence was in line with the punishment the judge said she would impose at Weisselberg's March 4 plea hearing.  


Court officers led Weisselberg out of the courtroom in handcuffs following a brief hearing. 


The sentence marks the second stint behind bars for the former U.S. president's longtime loyal deputy.  


Weisselberg, 76, spent around three months in New York's Rikers Island jail in 2023 after pleading guilty to participating in a 15-year tax fraud scheme at the Trump Organization. 


The perjury charges stem from Weisselberg's testimony at a civil fraud case New York state Attorney General Letitia James brought against Trump, Weisselberg and other executives at Trump's family real estate company for manipulating property values to dupe lenders and insurers. 


Weisselberg testified at the trial on Oct. 10 that he was not involved in an incorrect valuation of Trump's Manhattan townhouse. Trump's 2015 and 2016 financial statements valued the unit at $327 million based on its stated size of more than 30,000 square feet, nearly three times the actual size. 


Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office, which brought the charges against Weisselberg, said the former CFO's emails showed he was in fact paying close attention to the apartment.  


Weisselberg also admitted to lying about his role in Trump's financial statements during two earlier depositions with James' office. James' investigation culminated in a $454 million penalty imposed on Trump for fraudulently valuing properties. Trump is appealing the order by Justice Arthur Engoron.  


Engoron also ordered Weisselberg to pay $1.1 million including interest. 


Weisselberg worked for the former president's family for half a century. His written plea agreement did not indicate if he would be cooperating with Bragg's office. 


Trump is set to go on trial starting on Monday on criminal charges of covering up $130,000 in hush money his former lawyer Michael Cohen paid porn star Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she says she had with Trump in 2006. 


Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records and denies any such encounter with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. 


The case, also brought by Bragg, is poised to be the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Trump also faces three other indictments, which stem from his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss and his handling of sensitive government documents. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

## Microsoft may want to add a dedicated Windows 11 button for ads and promos

date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News

The company is seemingly contemplating on whether to add a new &#8220;Recommended&#8221; button on the Taskbar. Interestingly, it is unfinished at the moment, or perhaps Microsoft is just not sure if it should proceed with this button at all. ↫ Sayan Sen at Neowin The beatings will continue until morale improves.

## “Why does part of the Windows 98 Setup program look older than the rest?”

date: 2024-04-10, from: OS News

Well, this is something I never knew. Over on the retrocomputing section of StackExchange, someone asked why the second phase of the Windows 98 installation looked decidedly different from the third phase, even though they&#8217;re both graphical phases (the first phase is textual). The answer turns out to be both surprising, and entirely predictable. The first phase is a DOS program called DOSSETUP.BIN, which is the infamous blue part of the installation. The second part, however, is what we&#8217;re interested in here, and if the first phase is DOS, and the third phase is Windows 98 itself&#8230; What do you think the second phase is running? Yeah, exactly. Basically, because it is running under Windows 3.1 at that point. The second uses this minimal Windows 3.1 to run a Windows 3 program, W98SETUP.BIN (specified as the “shell” in SYSTEM.INI). This starts by copying more files to support all the information-gathering during setup, and various other niceties including the 3D look shown in your screenshot (the contents of the PRECOPY CABs); it ends by copying most of Windows 98, setting the system up so that it will boot Windows 98 from the target drive, and rebooting. ↫ Stephen Kitt So, in order to install Windows 98, you first run DOS, followed by Windows 3.1, ending in Windows 98. I have no idea why this is so funny to me, especially since it fits entirely within expectations of how Microsoft does things.

For me, using FSD in my Tesla is like riding a roller coaster. I don't trust the car not to kill me though. I spend most of my working life dealing with bugs in software. It's very easy for me to imagine what could go wrong. I don't understand how people can trust a computer with their lives this way. It's also disconcerting that the car coming at me in the other direction could be computer-driven. And nowadays when I see the other car is a Tesla, esp this month when everyone's getting a free demo of FSD, it's somewhat likely the OP is a computer.

The change is “the biggest shift in wildfire management in decades.” It involves creating more leadership teams – the top-level crewmembers who take on the biggest and most complex fires – and recruiting a lot of new wildland firefighters. The Forest Service aims to hire around 11,300 firefighters this year, <em><em>AP</em></em> reports. While in the past many firefighting jobs were seasonal, a longer season calls for more permanent positions. Fire season is already underway. More than 2,669 square miles burned in the first three months of 2024, more than half of last year’s total.

## Undocumented Indian migrants chart new path to US via Canada

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

washington — In recent years, the United States has seen an unprecedented surge in undocumented migrants from India, most slipping in through Mexico. But as the U.S.-Mexico border faces growing pressure, many are turning to a less conventional path: crossing the expansive and lightly guarded border with Canada.  


In fiscal year 2023, U.S. border agents encountered nearly 97,000 undocumented Indian migrants nationwide, including more than 30,000 at the northern border, according to data from the Customs and Border Patrol or CBP.   


Encounters include apprehensions and expulsions. In fiscal year 2019, more than 16,000 Indian migrants were encountered nationwide, CBP data shows.   


In recent months, the numbers have continued largely unabated. Between October 2023 and February 2024, nearly 14,000 Indians were encountered at the U.S.-Canada border.  


The record influx is part of a migration rush through Canada that has overwhelmed border security officials and unsettled communities in northern U.S. states. CBP data show that there were nearly 190,000 encounters at the Canadian border in 2023, more than six times the number in 2021.  


A spokesperson for the Indian embassy in Washington said the "extent of illegal immigration from India to the United States is unclear." 


"We have been constantly engaged with the United States authorities including through dialogues such as the India- U.S. Consular Dialogue and the Homeland Security Dialogue to enhance cooperation and strengthen people to people ties and to facilitate legal mobility and migration and to check illegal immigration and human trafficking," the spokesperson said in a statement to VOA. 


Indians drawn to US asylum process 


The end of the COVID-19 pandemic has spawned a rise in global migration. While people migrate for different reasons, experts say many Indian migrants are drawn to the U.S. by the Biden administration's perceived openness to asylum-seekers.  


"Overall, people are looking to come to the U.S. because they've heard about the asylum process here," said Chirag Patel, a Maryland-based immigration lawyer who handles Indian asylum cases.  


Patel and other experts say the flow of asylum-seekers to the border will likely keep up as they anticipate potential policy changes with the November U.S. presidential election.  


"People are trying to get a lot of things in before November, but also obviously before January, if November ends up being in favor of Trump," Patel said.  


'From all over the globe'


Once a trickle, the flood of Indian asylum-seekers entering the country shows the changing face of unauthorized migration to the U.S.  


"They're coming from all over the globe, literally all over the globe," said Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute.  


The rise in unauthorized Indian migration has made Indians the third-largest group of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. There were about 725,000 undocumented Indians in the U.S. in 2021, more than from any other country outside the Western Hemisphere, according to a recent Pew Research Center report.  


Though many have genuine claims of persecution, experts say Indian asylum-seekers are predominantly economic migrants, drawn by the prospect of a better life in the U.S.  


"Very few of these are the professionals," said Devesh Kapur, Starr Foundation professor of South Asian studies at Johns Hopkins University. "Because these youths are not very well-educated, their economic opportunities in India are pretty limited." 


Most are relatively well off by Indian standards and hail from Punjab and Gujarat, two of India's more prosperous states with a long history of immigration to the United States.  


"One of the mistakes we make is to think it's the poor that migrate," Kapur said. "The poor in South Asia simply cannot afford to take a flight."  


But those who can often lack a legal pathway into the United States. U.S. student visas are hard to come by, and because of a massive backlog of immigration cases, an immigrant visa can take up to 20 years to secure.  


That leaves the "donkey route" as the only option for many Indians anxious to reach America. The sometimes-dangerous journey across several continents, widely publicized on social media, is facilitated for a hefty fee by global human trafficking networks.  


The cost of getting to the U.S. can exceed $50,000, but even a small-scale landlord in Punjab can afford it. An acre of agricultural land in the fertile state can command the same price, Kapur noted.    


While Indian migrants often take the donkey route to Mexico, many find Canada a quicker and safer option, according to experts.    


Political scientist Shinder Purewal said the current Canadian government's push to attract international students has made it easier for Indians to obtain visas.   


"It's easier to get a visa to Canada than to Pakistan," said Purewal, who teaches at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Surrey, British Columbia.  


Until recently, Indians often moved from Canada to the U.S. when they couldn't get Canadian residency, Purewal said.  


"Now, more and more people are just entering Canada so they can just go straight to the U.S. because the economy is better, job prospects are better there," Purewal said.  


In a statement, Canada's immigration agency said all study permits are reviewed "holistically" to ensure applicants "respect Canada's immigration laws and regulations." 


"Canada's visa policy decisions are made in an effort to support travel and people-to-people connections, while preserving the integrity of our immigration system," the agency said. "We continuously monitor the impacts of our visa policy for both visa-exempt and visa-required countries and consider objective criteria when deciding whether to lift or impose a visa requirement. And new developments would be communicated publicly." 


But economic prospects are not the only reason Indian migrants choose the U.S. Support from established Indian communities in the U.S. also influence their decision.  


A smuggling network recently uncovered by U.S. investigators ferried Gujarati migrants from the Canadian border to Gujarati American-owned business establishments in the Chicago area.  


"People who come have a way of coming," said Pawan Dhingra, an associate provost and associate dean of the faculty at Amherst College who teaches immigration studies. "They have a connection to the country. If it was just escaping India, they could just go anywhere in the world."  


Not all cross border safely


Despite its reputation for safety, crossing the Canadian border has occasionally proven fatal for Indian migrants. 


In January 2022, an Indian family of four was found frozen to death in Manitoba just meters from the U.S. border. In March 2023, the bodies of eight migrants, including four Indians, were recovered from the St. Lawrence River.    


Maureen Silcoff, a Canadian refugee and immigration lawyer, said the extreme risks migrants take show their dire need to flee hardship.  


"People don't simply pick up and leave their homes, their communities, their families, their jobs out of a sense of wanting a thrilling adventure," Silcoff said in an interview. "People become desperate, and sometimes people are subject to very serious human rights abuses, and they try to alleviate those kinds of problems and other hardships by relocating to another country."

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I guess a question I’d have, maybe, for both of you is, how much of this is a China story? How much of the amount of progress that we’ve been able to do is actually because of Chinese industrial policies — the sheer scale of the Chinese market and the different incentives that exist on the demand side there to bring down the cost of solar, or batteries, or any of these technologies that are now the main engines of decarbonization?<br/><br/><strong>Sophie Purdom:</strong> I think so much about the supply side of the market, right? Those solutions and the innovation, which then kind of ideally ports over, if you succeed, into deployment, which has its own set of challenges and concerns and capital levers and policy integrations. I’d argue that the U. S. overall sits further on the supply versus demand side, relative to a global positioning, and that China’s been playing the demand side of the game much better. <br/><br/><strong>Akshat Rathi: </strong>The beauty of wanting to do this book was, to me, watching these lessons. So if you look at the solar story: invented in America; really scaled up in Europe, when Germany and Spain were providing a ton of subsidies for solar manufacturers to put rooftop solar in the early 2000s; and then really scaled up in China when they made a ton more capital available and just flooded the market, so to speak.<br/><br/>Take the electric vehicle story, a very different one because the new energy vehicle policy that made China the biggest maker and consumer — and now exporter — of electric cars actually takes inspiration from California’s zero emissions policy. It’s a vehicle mandate, right? So you have this policy that kind of worked in one state, forced the rest of America to think about it, but China just applied it nationwide and ran with it. So you can apply lessons from one country to another and have policies — one of those beautiful things, which, it can translate if you can tweak it to work in that political economy where it needs to operate.<br/><br/><strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>Let’s talk a little bit more about the particular form of climate capitalism with Chinese characteristics, how this sort of worked out. There’s a couple of case studies in the book of CATL and BYD and how they have come about. One of the things I want to underscore is, we’ve talked about how American-centric we often are. We sort of think, well, we got to drive all of this. But China increasingly is the world’s biggest market for all of these solutions, right? For EVs, for solar PV. They’re also, in many cases, the world’s largest manufacturer. And the scales are just staggering. <br/><br/>Now, I mean, we in the U.S. deployed just shy of 40 gigawatts of solar last year, something like 36 to 38 gigawatts. China deployed 280 gigawatts. More than half of the global market for solar was in China last year. So it’s not ... They started off selling to Spain and Germany, but now, their domestic market is enormous. You can tell a very similar story about EVs, where more than half of the market for EVs is in China — increasingly, more than half of the manufacturing, and now, rapidly, exports too. So what is the flavor of the capitalism story there?<br/><br/>Because many of these companies are state-owned enterprises, at least partially, there’s a strong hand of industrial policy guiding where investment occurs and making it cheaper, and giving free land, and all kinds of different things there. But of course, at the end of the day, there is a lot of ... it is in many ways capitalism. There’s a lot of financial motivation that has led these companies to scale and grow. </blockquote><div class="horizontal-rule">

## Carbon Removal’s $100 Billion Conundrum

date: 2024-04-10, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTk2MTQ0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDM4NDA4MX0.negH_EUPaUvtAvIIEJy3fqgcwkE561qCCndZPX_QLTU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Money seems to be pouring into the field of carbon removal from every direction. Every other week there’s an announcement about a <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/carbon-removal-orchard-one-spiritus" target="_self">new project</a>. Multimillion dollar <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heirloom-carbon-microsoft-removal" target="_self">carbon removal procurement deals</a> are on the rise. The Department of Energy is <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self">rolling out grants</a> as part of its $3.5 billion “direct air capture” hubs program and also funding research and development. Some carbon removal companies can even start claiming a $130 tax credit for every ton of CO2 they suck up and store underground. </p><p>The federal government alone spends <a href="https://carbon180.org/carbon-removal-funding-tracker/#total-funding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">just under $1 billion per year</a> on carbon removal research, development, and deployment. According to a <a href="https://rhg.com/research/carbon-dioxide-removal-us-policy/" target="_blank">new report</a> from the Rhodium Group, however, the U.S. is going to have to spend a lot more — roughly <em>$100 billion</em> per year by 2050 — if carbon dioxide removal, or CDR, is ever going to become a viable climate solution.</p><p>“The current level of policy support is nowhere near what's needed for CDR to play the role that people say it needs to play in solving climate change,” Jonathan Larsen, one of the authors, told me. “We wanted to reset the policy conversation with that in mind.”</p><p>Carbon removal is what’s implied by the “net” in net-zero — a way to compensate for whatever polluting activities are going to take longer to replace with clean solutions. It will be impossible to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, either at the national or global level, without removing carbon from the atmosphere. But how much carbon removal will we need, and how do we make sure we’re ready to deploy it?</p><p>These questions are, in a sense, unique to the field. When we talk about cutting carbon emissions from buildings or transportation, experts are relatively confident in the set of solutions and the scale of the task — they know how many buildings and cars there are and can make reasonable estimates of growth rates. </p><p>But carbon removal is a moving target. We know how much we’re removing today — roughly 5 million metric tons, mostly from nature-based solutions like planting trees. Based on current policies, Rhodium estimates we could scale that up to about 50 million metric tons by 2035. But figuring out how much we <em>need</em> depends entirely on how successful we are at decarbonizing everything else. Even if we know we need to electrify all our cars, for example, no one can say whether that will happen by 2050, or at least not with any meaningful degree of certainty. </p><p>The Rhodium Group report attempts to narrow the range of this uncertainty so that policymakers can better attack the problem. The authors looked at a handful of different decarbonization roadmaps for the U.S. and found that the minimum amount of carbon removal needed to compensate for residual emissions in 2050 is 1 gigaton, which is the same as one billion metric tons, or a 20x increase from where current policies will get us. It's also equal to about 20% of the carbon that the U.S. emitted last year. “There's a very likely scenario where we need a lot more than that,” said Larsen. “There's scenarios where we need less. But most of the studies out there say at least a gigaton.”</p><p>Even if it’s only a rough estimate, landing on a number is useful, he told me. Rhodium Group spends a lot of time answering questions about, for example, what some new policy means for achieving Biden’s goal of cutting emissions in half by 2030. “I don't know if we’d get those questions if there wasn't a 50% target to shoot for,” he said. “So I think this way, people can be like, what does this next wave of policy support for CDR do for getting the U.S. on track for a gigaton?”</p><p>The level of investment it will take to get there is also highly uncertain. The authors did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to land on $100 billion by 2050: We need to be removing a minimum of one billion tons by then, and the Department of Energy has <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a goal to bring the cost of carbon removal down</a> to $100 per ton.</p><p>The meat of the new report focuses on how to bridge the gap between the roughly $1 billion we spend today and $100 billion, which starts, according to the authors, with treating carbon removal as a public service. It’s not like other climate solutions such as wind turbines or heat pumps, they write, which can rely on private markets to provide predictable demand or to stimulate innovation. “There are very few pathways one can envision where the private sector is going to both scale and deliver those tons,” Larsen told me. Voluntary carbon removal purchases by companies could play a role, he said, but it will not be big enough to get to a gigaton. </p><p>Rhodium recommends expanding and extending many of the federal policy programs that already exist — by, for example, providing more R&D funding, doing more <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/carbon-removal-us-government" target="_self">government procurement</a>, handing out more loan guarantees, and creating more “hubs” centered on other approaches besides direct air capture, like <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-4-enhanced-rock-weathering" target="_self">enhanced weathering</a> or biomass burial. Right now, the tax credit for capturing carbon from the air and burying it underground can only be claimed for 12 years, and projects have to start construction by 2032. The authors call for extending the claim period and moving up the construction start deadline. They also recommend expanding the program to apply to a wider range of carbon removal methods. </p><p>A common criticism of government support for carbon removal is that policy makers will over-rely on it. If we aim to do 1 gigaton of carbon removal, does that mean we won’t cut emissions as much as we could have? What happens if, for whatever reason, we can’t achieve the 1 gigaton?</p><p>Larsen disagreed with that framing. For one, it’s easy to turn it around: If we don’t scale up the capacity to remove carbon, and we also don’t eliminate emissions by mid-century, we’re not even going to have the option to halt climate change at that point.</p><p>But also, decarbonization shouldn’t stop in 2050, he said. If we can achieve that 1 gigaton of annual removal and then keep cutting emissions from remaining sources, we could eventually get to net-<em>negative</em> emissions — even without more CDR. In other words, if we reach a point where we’re removing more than we’re emitting, we could start to reverse global warming, not just stop it.</p><p>“I know that's, like, sci-fi,” he told me. “But that's ultimately where we as a species have to go and that’s why setting a target here of at least a gigaton, to me, does not take away the need to reduce elsewhere.”</p>

## On video podcasts

## House to delay sending Mayorkas impeachment articles to Senate

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Speaker Mike Johnson will delay sending the House's articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to the Senate this week as planned after Republican senators requested more time Tuesday to build support for holding a full trial.


The sudden change of plans cast fresh doubts on the proceedings, the historic first impeachment of a Cabinet secretary in roughly 150 years. Seeking to rebuke the Biden administration's handling of the southern border, House Republicans impeached Mayorkas in February but delayed sending the articles while they finished work on government funding legislation.


Johnson had planned to send the impeachment charges to the Senate on Wednesday evening. But as it became clear that Democrats, who hold the majority of the chamber, had the votes to quickly dismiss them, Senate Republicans requested that Johnson delay until next week. They hoped the tactic would prolong the process.


While Republicans argued Tuesday that forgoing a full Senate trial would break precedent, most Senate Republicans voted to do just that when Donald Trump, the former president, was impeached a second time on charges he incited an insurrection in the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Their effort to halt the proceedings failed. Trump was ultimately acquitted in the Senate trial.


"Our members want to have an opportunity not only to debate but also to have some votes on issues they want to raise," said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican Senate leader. Under procedural rules, senators are required to convene as jurors the day after the articles of impeachment are transmitted for a trial.


Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. D-N.Y., who has decried the impeachment push as a sham, suggested Democrats still plan to deal with the charges quickly.


"We're ready to go whenever they are. We are sticking with our plan. We're going to move this as expeditiously as possible," Schumer said.


"Impeachment should never be used to settle policy disagreements," he told reporters earlier Tuesday.


House Republicans charged in two articles of impeachment that Mayorkas has not only refused to enforce existing law but also breached the public trust by lying to Congress and saying the border was secure.


Democrats — and a few Republicans — say the charges amount to a policy dispute, not the Constitution's bar of high crimes and misdemeanors.


"Ultimately, I think it's virtually certain that there will not be the conviction of someone when the constitutional test has not been met," said Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.


Still, with elections approaching, Republicans want to force Congress to grapple with the Biden administration's handling of the southern border as long as possible.


"I think there are a lot of Democrats who really want to avoid the vote. I don't blame them. I mean, this is the number one issue on the minds of Americans," Thune said.


Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is facing a tough reelection bid in Ohio, pointed to Republican senators rejecting a bipartisan deal aimed at tamping down the number of illegal border crossings from Mexico.


"Instead of doing this impeachment — the first one in 100 years — why are we not doing a bipartisan border deal?" Brown said.


Before Mayorkas, only one U.S. Cabinet official had ever been impeached. Secretary of War William Belknap in 1876. A House investigation found evidence that he had received kickback payments while administering government contracts.

## Taiwan’s Navy leaders seek cooperation with US at annual exposition

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

washington — Taiwan Navy Commander Admiral Tang Hua said during a trip to Maryland that the self-governing island wants more cooperation with the U.S. and other countries amid military pressure from China.


But as to whether or not he would hold direct talks with U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti, as reported by Reuters, Tang said he would not comment so as to avoid China's protest causing trouble to the U.S. side.


Speaking to VOA on Monday at this year's Sea-Air-Space Conference hosted by the Navy League of the U.S. at National Harbor, outside of Washington, Tang said he would meet with navy personnel from the U.S. and other countries.


"I think the People's Liberation Army's problem with Taiwan is not just about Taiwan," he said. "It may be in the East China Sea or the South China Sea. It is a global issue, not an issue specifically targeting Taiwan."


Taiwan split from China in 1949 after the nationalists lost to the communists and fled to the island, where they established a government that eventually became a democracy.


China claims Taiwan is a breakaway province that must one day reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary.


China also has territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea and claims most of the South China Sea as its own, putting it in conflict with Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.


The U.S. supports a "One China" policy that Beijing is the only recognized government of China while maintaining non-diplomatic relations with Taiwan and vowing to defend its right to self-governance.


In response to a Reuters question at a briefing March 29 about the Taiwan Navy chief's trip to the U.S., Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said China firmly opposes "military collusion between the U.S. and Taiwan."


He urged the U.S. to "immediately stop official interactions and military contact with Taiwan, and refrain from sending any wrong message to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces."


Tang said other countries' navies at the conference were also looking to partner up.


"Not only are the U.S. military, but also the navies of various countries here. In fact, regarding much of our current cooperation, you just heard them talk about many things, including manpower issues, shipbuilding issues, and demand and cooperation, so I think on these occasions, everyone is seeking opportunities for cooperation and integration," he said.


Tang, along with Rear Admiral Chung-Hsing Wei, defense attache with the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the U.S., and the visiting Taiwan delegation attended meetings and speeches of naval leaders from the U.S. and other countries.


He also visited the booths of major U.S. military manufacturers at the exhibition, including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, and inquired about weapons and equipment with companies that have procurement projects with Taiwan.


This included General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which produced four MQ-9B "SkyGuardian" drones for Taipei.


A senior official from the company also told him that he will join a U.S. Taiwan Business Council delegation to visit Taiwan in early June.

## US pushes back at Russia’s protest over South Korean sanctions

date: 2024-04-10, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States is welcoming South Korean sanctions imposed on Russian vessels suspected of transporting weapons from North Korea, despite Russian protests. 


“We applaud the recent actions taken by the ROK to disrupt and expose arms transfers between the DPRK and Russia – including the sanctions … on two Russian vessels involved in arms transfers to Russia,” a State Department spokesperson said.


“It is important for the international community to send a strong, unified message that the DPRK must halt its irresponsible behavior, abide by its obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions, and engage in serious and sustained diplomacy,” the spokesperson said Friday via email to the VOA Korean Service.


South Korea on April 2 unilaterally sanctioned two Russian vessels involved in delivering military supplies from North Korea to Russia.  


The next day at a press briefing, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova called Seoul’s move “an unfriendly step” that “leads only to escalation of tensions” and “will affect South Korea-Russia relations in a negative way.” 


She said Moscow would respond to the sanctions but did not specify how. 


On Friday, Russia said it had summoned South Korea’s ambassador.  




The South Korean sanctions followed Russia’s veto of a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the annual extension of the U.N. experts panel that monitors sanctions on North Korea. The panel’s mandate ends at the end of April.


The ties between Pyongyang and Moscow have been growing since a summit in September. Since then, North Korea has been providing munitions that Russia needs to fight its war in Ukraine.


“The ROK government getting involved in applying sanctions, seizures, and other active counterproliferation authorities and capabilities against the North is a huge step forward in joint cooperation to counter, protect and contain the DPRK regime’s weapons exports,” said David Asher, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.   


Asher worked on disrupting North Korea’s illicit financial, trading and weapons of mass destruction networks under the George W. Bush administration.


In an email to VOA on Monday, Asher added, “I fully expect ROK-U.S.-Japan cooperation to expand in counterproliferation, including the identification and targeting of weapons supply networks using intelligence operations, law enforcement, and sanctions.”


A day after announcing the sanctions, Seoul said it had seized a vessel that was suspected of violating U.N. sanctions on North Korea. South Korea said it was investigating the DEYI, a cargo ship that was en route to Russia from North Korea via China, after seizing it in waters off the South Korean port city of Yeosu.


“This reinforces that countries can implement U.N. sanctions, on their own, as they have responsibility to do so,” especially after Russia blocked the U.N. experts panel’s mandate, said Anthony Ruggiero, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Ruggiero has over 19 years working on financial sanctions and proliferation issues, including ones involving North Korea.


There is a broad international and domestic set of legal authorities that countries like South Korea could rely on to go after illicit exports and maritime activities by North Korea, but it is a matter of “whether countries are willing to stop” vessels making illegal actions, Ruggiero said during a telephone interview on Monday. 


A U.N. Security Council resolution passed in 2017 authorizes member states to seize, inspect, freeze and impound vessels in their territorial waters found to be conducting illicit activities with Pyongyang and carrying banned goods from North Korea.  


A State Department spokesperson told VOA’s Korean Service on Thursday that the U.S. is “coordinating closely with the ROK in its investigation of this ship in connection with U.N. sanctions violations.”


“Despite Russia’s veto of the 1718 Committee Panel of Experts mandate in order to bury reporting on its violation of U.S. Security Council resolutions, U.N. sanctions on the DPRK remain in place, and all U.N. member states are still required to implement them,” the spokesperson said.


Nate Evans, the spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the U.N., said Monday that U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield will travel to South Korea and Japan next week to discuss ways to monitor international sanctions on North Korea.


South Korea estimated in March that North Korea has shipped about 7,000 containers full of munitions to Russia since last year. The U.S. assessed the same month the number of containers to be 10,000.


Joshua Stanton, an attorney based in Washington who helped draft the Sanctions and Policy Enforcement Act in 2016, told VOA on Monday via email that Seoul could seize ships carrying weapons from North Korea to Russia if certain criteria are met. 


Seoul could do so “if South Korea has reasonable cause to believe that the vessel is engaged in sanctions evasion, and if one of the following conditions is also met: the [vessel’s] flag state consents, the vessel is stateless, or the ship enters a South Korean port.”

## Deep Bug

date: 2024-04-10, from: Marginallia log

The project has been haunted by a mysterious bug since sometime February. It relates to the code that constructs the index, particularly the code that merges partial indices.
In short the search engine constucts the reverse index through successive merging of smaller indices, which reduces the overall memory requirement.
You can conceptualize the revese index itself as two files, one with offset pointers into another file, which has sorted numbers. This code runs after each partition finishes crawling and processing its data, and has a run time of about 4 hours.
