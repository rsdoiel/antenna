lawmakers press Biden for plans on Chinese use of open chip
technology</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: OS News</p>
<p>A wider bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is asking the Biden
administration about its plans to respond to China’s rising use of
RISC-V chip design technology after Reuters last month reported on
growing concerns about it in both houses of Congress. Now, a broader
group of 18 lawmakers that includes five Democrats is asking the Biden
administration for how it plans to prevent China “from achieving
dominance in … RISC-V technology and leveraging that dominance at the
expense of U.S. national and economic security,” according to a letter
the group sent to Raimondo and seen by Reuters. A rather shortsighted
take, and without even looking I wouldn’t be surprised if some of these
lawmakers have chip factories or whatever in their districts.</p>

<h2 id="gaza-has-never-had-enough-water">Gaza Has Never Had Enough
Water</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps" style>
Home to two million people, the Gaza Strip sits squeezed between Israel
and the Mediterranean Sea on a bit of land just twice the size of
Washington, D.C. Gaza is the smaller part of Palestine’s two
territories; you could walk the length of its southern border with Egypt
in under three hours. But land is not the only thing that’s long been in
short supply in Gaza. As the war between Israel and Hamas, the
Palestinian militant group that rules the region, has made clear, Gaza
is also increasingly bereft of water.
</p>
<p style>
Over the course of the tragic war, water infrastructure has played an
unprecedented role. In the aftermath of Hamas’s massacre and kidnapping
of Israeli civilians on October 7, the Israeli government took measures
to halt drinking water — as well as aid, food, and electricity — from
entering the Strip. First, on October 9, Israel shut off the pipelines
that usually send water into Gaza and halted deliveries by truck. And
while it turned back on some of the pipelines on October 15, it didn’t
restart the electricity or the fuel shipments that power Gaza’s
desalination and wastewater treatment plants.
</p>
<p style>
Yet these harsh measures in recent weeks belie a much longer-term
problem, as a deeper dive into the region’s infrastructure reveals.
Palestinians in Gaza have not had access to safe or ample drinking water
for decades.
</p>
<p style>
“The water crisis that Gaza is facing is a chronic crisis,” Dr. Shaddad
Attili, the former Palestinian minister of water and head of the
Palestinian Water Authority (PWA) from 2008 to 2014, told me. “But now
water is being used as a weapon. If they don’t get killed by missiles,
they will die from the contaminated water that they’re using.”
</p>
<p style>
The Israeli Defense Forces, the water authority in the West Bank, and
COGAT, the Israeli body responsible for the government activities in the
Palestinian territories, all did not reply to requests for comment by
the time of publication.
</p>
<h3 style>
A history of water
</h3>
<p style>
There are three natural water resources that run through Israel and
Palestine: the Jordan River Basin on the eastern border; the Mountain
Aquifer, which runs directly through the West Bank; and the Coastal
Aquifer, on which Israel is upstream and Gaza is downstream. The
majority of the water comes from these three sources, but since the
region is a desert geography, water is generally in short supply.
</p>
<p style>
Israel acquired control over all the water that runs through the Israeli
and Palestinian territories in the Six-Day War in 1967 when it seized
the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan
Heights in the north from Syria. In November of that year, Israel
introduced a military order stating that Palestinians could not
construct any new water infrastructure without first
<a href="https://www.btselem.org/publications/202305_parched" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obtaining
a permit from the Israeli army</a>. Israel gave, and continues to give,
these permits sparingly.
</p>
<p>
Today, the water discrepancy is striking. While there are eight times
more Palestinians living in the West Bank than Israeli settlers, 70% of
the water output is given to the settlements, where it is largely used
for farming, according to an
<a href="https://www.btselem.org/publications/202305_parched" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">April
2023 report</a> on the West Bank’s water deprivation by the Israeli
humanitarian organization, B’Tselem.
</p>
<p>
During the Oslo Accords in the mid-1990s, the West Bank won some rights
to run their own pumping stations in select parts of the territory.
Today, they still need to earn permits from the Israeli military in
order to build new pumping stations. Gaza used to pump their water from
the Coastal Aquifer, but developments over the past 30 years have made
that water inaccessible.
</p>
<h3 style>
Why Gaza has so little water
</h3>
<p>
Prior to this war, the water situation in Gaza was already dire. The
World Health Organization said that Gaza’s water supply was
<a href="https://unsco.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/atlas_of_sustainable_development_2020.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">unable
to meet the minimum requirement</a> for daily per capita water
consumption.
</p>
<p>
Gaza has some unregulated pumping stations that pull water up from the
aquifer, but they’re not a major cause of the problem. The Coastal
Aquifer extends from a town called Binyamina in Northern Israel to the
Sinai Desert in Egypt. Just 2% of the total aquifer passes through Gaza.
Through the late 1990s, it supplied drinkable tap water to most of
Gaza’s residents. While it historically has provided 95% of their
freshwater, it’s unusable now for a few reasons.
</p>
<p>
First, Gaza’s population growth rate is among the highest in the world,
with almost half of the population under 18 years old in 2022. High
population growth means the already scarce groundwater can no longer
replenish fast enough to meet demand.
</p>
<p>
But there are deeper problems with the water’s quality. Seawater seeps
into the aquifer since it’s so close to the coast and untreated
wastewater has polluted the aquifer for decades to a point that it’st is
no longer safe to drink. In 2020, a study in the journal <em>Water</em>
said that the quality of groundwater in the Coastal Aquifer had
“deteriorated rapidly,” largely due to Israeli pumping.
</p>
<p>
“At least 95% of the freshwater (from the aquifer) is either
inaccessible or not drinkable,” said Jordan Fischbach, director of
planning and policy research at The Water Institute and author of a
report on the
<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2515.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">public
health impacts of Gaza’s water crisis</a> in 2018.
</p>
<p>
As a result, the Coastal Aquifer — the primary source of Gaza’s water —
is essentially out of commission. Residents of Gaza are now left with
only about 20% of their needs filled.
</p>
<p>
But those sources have also proven to be unreliable.
</p>
<p>
The first are the pipelines, which were built with funding from
international humanitarian aid. The pipelines run from Israel-controlled
fresh aquifers and the water is paid for by the Palestinian National
Authority (PA) in the West Bank. These are the pipelines that Israel
stopped sending water from following Hamas’ attack on Israeli civilians.
</p>
<p>
But even in the best of times, the pipelines only supply around 10% of
the water demand in Gaza. Attili from the Palestinian National Authority
said that the water is combined with some of the unsafe brackish water
in order to increase volume.
</p>
<p>
The second source of water are small-scale desalination plants, which
turn seawater into potable water, but they rely on electricity to run.
</p>
<p>
Usually they provide another 10% of Gaza’s water, but when Israel halted
the importation of fuel and shut down electricity transmission into
Gaza, these plants stopped running too.
</p>
<p>
However, even when electricity and fuel are available, over one-third of
plants are not monitored, maintained, or officially regulated. “A number
of construction materials, fuel and other things you would need to build
and power drinking and wastewater facilities are considered ‘dual use.’”
said Fischbach, meaning they could also be used to build weapons. “These
are types of materials that are restricted by both Egyptian and Israeli
authorities.”
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352521457_The_Effect_of_Implementing_the_Integrated_Management_System_in_Desalination_Plants_in_Conflict_Zones_Case_Study_on_the_Gaza_Strip" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2021
study</a> showed that 79% of desalination plants are unlicensed and 12%
of water samples tested showed dangerous contamination levels.
</p>
<p>
“Desalination is necessary to get anything even close to drinking water
quality and only a fraction of [desalination plants] are actually
licensed and monitored” said Fischbach. “Many of them are producing
water that we would still consider below drinking water quality.”
</p>
<p>
He added that most of them don’t run to their capacity anyways because
they are so energy intensive and Gaza doesn’t have enough electricity.
</p>
<p style>
Gaza also gets water from water trucks controlled by humanitarian aid or
delivered by the Palestinian National Authority. This water passes
directly through Israeli land, which means Israel was able to easily
halt deliveries in the wake of the Hamas attacks.
</p>
<p style>
In recent weeks, some residents of Gaza have resorted to drinking sea
water or brackish water directly from the Coastal Aquifer. Not only are
these not sources of freshwater, they are also further polluted by
untreated sewage running through the region.
</p>
<h3 style>
How sewage pollutes what little water Gaza has left
</h3>
<p style>
Israel’s decision to cut electricity to Gaza also meant that the
wastewater treatment plants can’t run. Treated wastewater is used for
showering and other sanitation uses. But when it’s not processed through
a plant, wastewater runs into the aquifer and groundwater, further
polluting what’s left of their drinking sources.
</p>
<p>
While the situation is worse due to the lack of electricity from the
war, Gaza has never had ample wastewater treatment plants.
</p>
<p style>
“For two decades now Palestinians have been prevented from building and
maintaining the infrastructures that keep wastewater out of the
aquifer,” says Sophia Stamatopoulou-Robbins, a cultural anthropologist
and professor at Bard College. She is the author of <em>Waste Siege: the
Life and Infrastructure of Palestine</em>.
</p>
<p style>
In the West Bank, the aquifer is deep, carrying around 340 million cubic
meters of water every year, so wastewater that has been somewhat treated
can be further cleaned by soil and rock as it seeps through the aquifer.
But Gaza’s aquifer is very shallow — its estimated to carry only about
<a href="https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-202217/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">55
million cubic meters</a> per year —, and therefore cannot clean the
water. Instead, it needs extensive infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
“In Gaza, you would need an incredibly high sophistication of technology
to permit the wastewater to go safely into the ground,” says
Stamatopoulou-Robbins. “Even the kind of concrete containers that would
hold wastewater are not permitted to be maintained or built.”
</p>
<p>
In addition to the plants themselves, you would need piping to connect
buildings to the wastewater treatment plants, she adds. “So all of the
conveyance technology and infrastructure which is expensive anywhere in
the world, all of that is subject to Israeli controls and tends to be
prevented.”
</p>
<p>
As is the case with desalination plants, neither Israel nor Egypt allows
the necessary materials into Gaza for building wastewater treatment
plants because those materials are also considered dual-use materials.
</p>
<p>
Even as Israel turned the water and electricity back on, there are
questions around how many of these desalination and wastewater treatment
plants have been bombed and are no longer running.
</p>
<p style>
As far as logistically turning off these resources, it’s fairly
straightforward. “The ability to shut off electricity transmission is
quite easy,” said Fischbach. “It’s just flipping a switch — the same way
with a rolling blackout. Fuel imports are also easy. Nothing is going
into Gaza. As far as drinking water lines, you can just not pump that
water. So the logistics are easy.”
</p>
<p style>
Several reports of hygiene related diseases spreading through cramped
spaces are surfacing in recent days. Doctors in Gaza are saying that
patients are showing signs of disease caused by overcrowding and poor
sanitation. Children are
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-displaced-show-signs-disease-crowding-poor-sanitation-doctors-2023-10-24/#:~:text=GAZA%2C%20Oct%2024%20(Reuters),under%20Israel's%20heaviest%2Dever%20bombardment." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suffering</a>
from diarrhea, lung infections, and rashes.
</p>
<p style>
“The desalination plants are out of service because there’s no
electricity, the sewage treatment plants are out of service because
there is no electricity. And because our people now take refuge in
shelters, there is a hygiene problem,” said Attili. “I have gone to so
many conferences where we say water is a tool for cooperation, not
conflict, and they all agree, but now the international community
remains silent.”

<p>
There are far too many smart home devices which make using a device
<em>harder</em>. Like a light switch and light bulb that requires a
wireless connection to a hub in order to control the lights.
</p>
<p>
Before, you could flick a switch, and a light would come on.
</p>
<p>
Now, you have to ensure the light has power, the switch has power, and
the hub has power. And the wireless connection between switch, hub, and
light needs to be reliable. And the hub can’t lock up or go offline. And
if it’s anything like most modern IoT devices, the hub needs a reliable
Internet connection and cloud account, or things will start failing at
some point.
</p>
<p>
That’s dumb.
</p>
<p>
And that’s just light switches. Can you imagine relying on this kind of
‘smarts’ for essential services in your home, like HVAC, water supply,
etc.?
</p>
<p>
To be truly ‘smart’, I follow three principles for home automation.
Every smart device must be:

The buzzy topic of conversation among New York City Marathon race
volunteers in the predawn hours of Sunday morning wasn’t if a course
record was going to be broken or Peres Jepchirchir’s
<a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/peres-jepchirchir-new-york-city-marathon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pre-race
withdrawal</a>, but how we decided what we were going to wear.
</p>
<p style>
This year, I was one of the marathon Start Village’s waste diversion and
composting volunteers (on brand!), which meant setting an alarm for 2:05
a.m. to catch a bus to Staten Island in time for check-in. When I left
my apartment, the temperature was a nippy 47 degrees and still dropping;
my toes started to hurt from the cold during the on-site orientation and
I was grateful I’d opted for a fleece base layer. But by the time my
shift ended, and the last wave of runners was heading across the start
line and over the Verrazano Bridge, it was around 63 degrees and I was
sweating through my volunteer beanie. One of the most discarded items at
my waste diversion station, up there with banana peels and spare water
bottles, was unused hand warmers.
</p>
<p style>
According to historic weather data kept by FindMyMarathon.com, the 2023
New York City marathon was
<a href="https://findmymarathon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about
5 degrees warmer</a> this year than average. Blessedly, it was also
about 11 degrees <em>cooler</em> than last year’s record high of 74
degrees, which caused
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-11-08/heat-injuries-abound-at-unseasonably-warm-new-york-city-marathon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hundreds
of heat-related injuries</a>, depleted on-course water stations, and saw
runners collapsing along the five-borough route. The ideal marathon
temperature,
<a href="https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/new-york-marathon-warm-climate-change-runners-prepare.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">metabolically
speaking</a>, is between 52 and 54 degrees Fahrenheit (or, by some
estimates,
<a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/races-places/a20824056/whats-the-optimal-temperature-for-marathons/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">even
colder</a>), which is part of why New York’s November marathon has been
such an ideal and legendary race, albeit one that can be
<em>bitterly</em> cold at the start line. Though that might be changing.
</p>
<p style>
As
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/new-englands-most-important-weather-forecast-is-getting-more-unpredictable" target="_self">I’ve
written before</a>, the world’s major marathons, which are held during
the shoulder seasons to optimize good running weather, are trending
warmer. According to one study, the number of cities that could host an
Olympic marathon safely is
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07934-6" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected
to decline by 27%</a> by as soon as the late 21st century due to rising
temperatures. Boston Marathon winning times are expected to get slower
and slower as the city’s average April high temperatures continue to
creep up. The New York City Marathon, which used to be held annually in
October, has
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/sports/new-york-city-marathon-jaunt-in-park-now-a-run-for-money.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already
been bumped back</a>, in the 1980s, in pursuit of cooler temperatures
and faster results; is there a future in which it could be bumped back
again, to mid- or late-November, solely because of climate change?
</p>
<p style>
Sunday’s high in the 60s ultimately didn’t impact the marathon results
too dramatically; Tamirat Tola managed to set a new course record, after
all. And admittedly, runners are prone to complain if it’s above 55
degrees out, as Laura Green jokes in her popular
“<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoCnRGCpuRz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Strava
Decoded</a>” TikTok video. But the 2023 New York City Marathon didn’t
make it out of the year entirely unscathed by climate change, either:
The race’s officially sanctioned 18-mile training run on Sept. 30 was
<a href="https://www.nyrr.org/races/tcsnewyorkcitymarathontrainingseries18m#:~:text=A%20State%20of%20Emergency%20has,City%20Marathon%20Training%20Series%2018M." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">canceled</a>
due to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/nyc-flooding-whirlpool-subway-sea-lions" target="_self">flooding</a>
from a storm that researchers said was
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/02/new-york-city-flooding-rain-storm-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">10%
to 20% wetter</a> than it would have been a century earlier.
</p>
<p style>
As a high-intensity sport that requires traversing miles of outdoor
space, road running is — and will continue to be — especially vulnerable
to these sorts of shifts. This year, runners mostly lucked out with the
weather. But November 2024 is another year.

<h2 id="new-study-sizes-up-how-countries-see-the-us-and-china">New Study
Sizes Up How Countries See the US and China</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ahead of the APEC Economic Leaders’ Week in San Francisco, where U.S.
President Joe Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are expected to meet,
a study comparing views of China and the U.S. across 24 countries shows
that people’s views of Washington are more favorable than those of
Beijing, especially among high and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>The new data essay released by Pew Research Center Monday, compares
previously published views of the U.S. and China and highlights the
differences across more than 10 measures, including confidence in U.S.
and Chinese leaders, perception of their economic power and
technological prowess.</p>
<p>Countries featured in the study include advanced economies in North
America and Europe, as well as middle-income countries in Asia Pacific,
Latin America, and Africa.</p>
<p>Skewed to the U.S.</p>
<p>When it comes to favorable views of the U.S. and China, the study
found that high-income countries tend to “skew toward the US.” Japan and
South Korea favor the U.S. over China by 57% and 62%.</p>
<p>There are smaller differences in views of the two countries in
middle-income countries surveyed with countries having “generally
positive” views of China and the United States.</p>
<p>The difference in the confidence in Biden and Xi was prominent in
countries such as Germany and Sweden where 53% and 64% more expressed
confidence in Biden over Xi. In Indonesia and Kenya, the difference in
confidence toward the two leaders was only a few percentage points, with
Biden maintaining a slight lead over Xi.</p>
<p>“These gaps in views of the American and Chinese leaders reflect both
souring attitudes toward Xi in high-income countries and greater
confidence in Biden,” the Pew researchers wrote.</p>
<p>Although views of China and the U.S. have fluctuated over the years,
according to Pew, they have “rebounded dramatically in many of the
countries surveyed” since Biden came to power, while views of China
remain “among their most negative.”</p>
<p>“Confidence in the U.S. president was relatively low in 2007 when
Bush was president but increased when Obama took office in 2008,” said
Christine Huang, research associate at Pew Research Center and one of
the authors of the latest study.</p>
<p>“Favorable views of the U.S. likewise because substantially more
positive in most countries surveyed during the Obama era. Confidence in
China’s president has also declined over time alongside favorable views
of the country,” she told VOA in a written response.</p>
<p>Richard Turcsányi, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Palacky
University Olomouc in the Czech Republic says “high-income countries are
more often than not U.S. allies, so they are comfortable with the
current international order …They tend to be democratic and thus dislike
China for its authoritarian system.”</p>
<p>He said middle-income countries are rarely traditional U.S. allies
and they are often “not fully democratic,” so these countries want to
change some things in the world to elevate their roles.</p>
<p>“Many of them inhibit various dislikes and feelings of injustice,
often targeting the U.S., Europe, and the West in general and China
seems like an alternative. While they may not exactly like Beijing, the
difference between the U.S. and China will be less pronounced in their
eyes,” he added.</p>
<p>U.S. more interventionist</p>
<p>While the U.S. enjoys more favorable views than China in general,
people in the 24 countries surveyed hold mixed views of Washington and
Beijing when it comes to foreign policy.</p>
<p>The study shows that the U.S. is more likely to be viewed as an
interventionist power than China in almost all countries. In Greece 93%
of the people surveyed viewed the U.S. as a country that interferes in
other nations’ affairs and 56% viewed the same of China leading to a 37%
point difference in China’s favor. In Australia however, there is only a
two-percentage point difference with Australians surveyed viewing the
U.S. similarly as countries that will intervene in the affairs of other
countries.</p>
<p>More people across the 24 countries, including in Japan, Canada and
Mexico, also think the U.S. is more likely to take their countries’
interests into account than China. In addition to that, more people
surveyed in the 24 countries, including South Korea, the U.K. and India,
think the U.S. contributes to global peace and stability than China
does.</p>
<p>Pew researchers say these results show that global views of the U.S.
and China may not be as absolute as the overall favorable ratings both
countries receive.</p>
<p>“A closer look at each country’s image shows areas where China
outperforms the U.S.,” Huang from Pew told VOA.</p>
<p>Tech and military power</p>
<p>Compared to the starker contrasts between views of the U.S. and China
in measures such as favorability and confidence in leaders, the study
found that differences are less prominent in areas like technological
power.</p>
<p>Among all the countries surveyed, a median 72% of the people view
U.S. technology as “the best or above average,” and 69% have similar
thoughts about Chinese technology. Despite the small overall difference,
people surveyed in Latin American countries, such as Mexico and
Argentina, were more likely to rate China’s technological achievements
positively while U.S. technological achievements tend to receive more
positive reviews in Asian countries included in the study, including
South Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>Huang from Pew told VOA that regional variations in views of the U.S.
and China’s technology may be tied to differences in market penetration
of various products. “Chinese technology is seen especially likely to be
considered well-made in Nigeria, where Chinese companies currently have
control of much of the mobile market share,” she said.</p>
<p>While majorities in every country surveyed say the American military
is above average or the best and only about half of the countries
surveyed say the same of China, the Pew study found that “there is
little difference” in ratings of Chinese and American militaries between
middle-income countries such as Mexico and high-income countries like
Germany.</p>
<p>Some researchers say results from public opinion studies can serve as
important reference points for policymakers around the world.
“Policymakers in many countries depend on public opinion because they
stand in elections,” Turcsányi in Czech Republic told VOA.</p>
<p>“If the general mood around the leaders is that China is seen
negatively with little economic promises, leaders will be willingly or
unwillingly influenced by this sentiment and will act on it,” he
added.</p>
<p>Pew researchers said they hope findings from the study can help
policymakers and government officials establish a better understanding
of the geopolitical balance between the U.S. and China.</p>
<p>“We can’t say for certain how it will be used, and it’s up to the
officials to hopefully watch programs like this one and learn from our
research,” Laura Silver, associate director at Pew Research Center and
one of the authors of the study, told VOA.</p>

<h2 id="pluralistic-amazon-is-a-ripoff-06-nov-2023">Pluralistic: Amazon
is a ripoff (06 Nov 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Amazon is a ripoff: New Amazon paradox just dropped.
Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003,
2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Amazon is a
ripoff (permalink) There’s a cheat-code in US antitrust law, one that’s
been increasingly used since the Reagan administration, when the
“consumer welfare” theory (“monopolies are fine, so long as the lower
prices”) shoved aside the long-established idea that antitrust law
existed to prevent monopolies from forming at all. The idea that a
company can do anything to create or perpetuate a monopoly so long as
its prices go down and/or its quality goes up is directly to blame for
the rise of Big Tech. These companies burned through their investors’
cash for years, selling goods and services below cost, or even giving
stuff away for free. Think of Uber, who lost $0.41 on every dollar they
brought in for their first 13 years of existence, a move that cost their
investors (mostly Saudi royals) $31 billion. The monopoly cheerleaders
in the consumer welfare camp understood that these money-losing orgies
could not go on forever, and that the investors who financed them
weren’t doing so for charitable purposes. But they dismissed the
possibility that would-be monopolists could raise prices after attaining
dominance, because these prices hikes would bring new competitors into
the market, starting the process over again. Well, Uber has doubled the
price of a ride and halved the wages of its drivers (not that consumer
welfare theorists care about workers’ wages – they care about consumer
welfare, not worker welfare). And not just Uber: companies that captured
whole markets have jacked up prices and lowered quality across the
board, a Great Enshittening whose playbook has been dubbed “venture
predation”:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/19/fake-it-till-you-make-it/#millennial-lifestyle-subsidy
Not only was this turn predictable – it was predicted. Back in 2017,
Lina Khan – then a law student – published a earthshaking Yale Law
Journal paper, “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,” laying out how monopolists
would trap their customers and block new competitors as they raised
prices and lowered quality:
https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox Today,
Khan is the chair of the FTC, and has brought a case against Amazon that
turns her legal theories into practice, backed by a cheering chorus of
Amazon customers, workers, suppliers and competitors who’ve been cheated
by the e-commerce giant: https://pluralistic.net/ApexPredator Khan’s
case argues that Amazon is not the house of bargains that it’s widely
billed as. She points to the sky-high fees that Amazon extracts from its
sellers (45-51% of every dollar!) and the company’s use of “most favored
nation” deals that force sellers who raise their Amazon prices to pay
those rents to raise their prices everywhere else, too:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/25/greedflation/#commissar-bezos Now, a
new Amazon Paradox has dropped, and it drills into another way that
Amazon overcharges most of us by as much as 29% on nearly every
purchase, disqualifying it from invoking that consumer welfare cheat
code. The new paper is “Amazon’s Pricing Paradox,” from law professors
Rory Van Loo and Nikita Aggarwal, for The Harvard Journal of Law and
Technology: https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/3645/ The
authors concede that while Amazon does have some great bargains, it goes
to enormous lengths to make it nearly impossible to get those bargains.
Drawing from the literature on behavioral economics, the authors make
the reasonable (and experimentally verified) assumption that shoppers
generally assume that the top results in an Amazon search are the best
results, and click on those. But Amazon’s search-ordering is
enshittified: it shifts value from sellers and shoppers (you!) to the
company. A combination of self-preferencing (upranking Amazon’s own
knock-offs), pay-for-placement (Amazon ads), other forms of payola
(whether a merchant is paying for Prime), and “junk ads” (that don’t
match your search) turn Amazon’s search-ordering into a rigged casino
game. The ability to manipulate customers and sellers and get more money
from both is why Amazon has so many incentives to use Amazon’s internal
search tool, rather than, say, searching Amazon via Google, which can
yield far superior results. For years, Amazon ran a program called
Amazon Smile, where a share of every purchase you made would be given to
a charity of your choice – but only if you found that item by searching
for it on Amazon, and not via Google or a direct link:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys In their new
paper, the authors extract and analyze a large dataset of common items
you might buy on Amazon, determining which result is best – the lowest
price at the highest rating – and then calculating how much more you’ll
pay for that item if you click the first relevant (non-ad) item on the
search results. If you trust Amazon search to find you the best product
and click that first link, you will pay a 29% premium for that item. If
you expand your selection to the “headline” – the first four items,
which are often all that’s visible without scrolling – you’ll pay an
average of 25% more. That top row accounts for 64% of Amazon’s clicks.
On average, the best deal on Amazon is found in the seventeenth slot in
the search results. Seventeen! Amazon argues that none of this matters,
because it allows users to refine their searches to get the best
bargains, but Amazon’s search won’t let you factor in “unit pricing” –
that is, the price per unit. So if you order your search by price, the
seller who’s offering a single pencil for $10 will show up above a
seller who’s offering ten pencils for $10.01. Here is an iron law of
cons: any time someone adds complexity to a proposition bet, the
complexity exists solely to make it hard for you to figure out if you’re
getting a good deal. Whether that’s the payout lines on a craps table,
the complex interplay of deductibles and co-pays on your health
insurance, the menu of fees your bank charges, or the add-ons for your
cell-phone plan, the complexity exists to confound your intuition and
overwhelm your reason:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/04/house-always-wins/#are-you-on-drugs
And Amazon certainly knows how to pile on the complexity! First, there’s
the irrelevant results – AAA batteries that show up in a search for AA
batteries, or dog accessories that show up in a search for cat
accessories:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/28/enshittification/#relentless-payola
Then there’s the “drip pricing”: extra charges that get tacked on at
checkout, like shipping fees. I once found an item on Amazon that
advertised “free shipping” – but at checkout, that “free shipping” came
with a delivery date that was three months in the future. Upgrading to
shipping in the current quarter doubled the price. Drip pricing makes it
hard to figure out if Prime is a good deal, too. Recall that Amazon
already comps shipping on orders over $25, so a potential Prime
purchaser has to evaluate whether they’ll place enough sub-$25 orders in
the coming year to justify the price – and also factor in the fact that
Prime items are often more expensive on a per-unit basis than their
non-Prime equivalents. Yes, Prime comes with other perks – music and
videos – but valuing these just adds complexity to your calculations
about whether Prime is a good buy for you, and requires that you factor
in the possibility that Amazon will enshittify those services and reduce
their value in the coming year, say, by taking away the ability to turn
off shuffle when listening to music:
https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-prime-music-alexa-restrictions-shuffle-11674054533
Or stuffing ads into your videos:
https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/22/23885242/amazon-prime-tv-movies-streaming-ads-subscription-date
Finally, there’s the nonsense labels that Amazon pastes onto its search
results: “Best Seller,” “Climate Pledge Friendly,” “Highly Rated,” “Top
Rated From Our Brands” and other gibberish that doesn’t necessarily mean
what it seems like it means. Is an item a “best seller” because it was
briefly price-dropped, or elevated in search results, or both, or
because other shoppers genuinely liked it better? The authors conclude
that getting the best price on Amazon requires that you “first spend
considerable time searching through pages of results and then utilize,
at a minimum, spreadsheet algebraic capabilities to determine the
product’s full price…[and] somehow de-bias from the psychological
effects of anchoring, and labels such as ‘limited time deal’ and ‘Best
Seller,’ as well as many other subtle psychological influences.” Amazon
says it’s entitled to use the consumer welfare cheat-code to get out of
antitrust enforcement because it has so many bargains. But to get those
bargains, you have to pay such minutely detailed attention – literally
spreadsheeting your options and hand-coding mathematical formulas to
compare them – that you’ll almost certainly fail. The price of failure
is incredibly high – a 25-29% overcharge on every purchase. Amazon’s
burying of this vital information will be familiar to Douglas Adams
readers, as the “Beware of the Leopard” tactic. It’s not even the first
time Amazon’s deployed it:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/03/27/beware-of-the-leopard/#relentless
Another group of scholars recently coined a useful term to describe this
ripoff: in a paper published last week, Tim O’Reilly, Mariana Mazzucato
and Ilan Strauss dubbed the costs of all this complexity “attention
rents”:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/03/subprime-attention-rent-crisis/#euthanize-rentiers
It’s fascinating to see these two different groups of scholars, coming
at this problem from multiple disciplines, all converging on the same
analysis! When technologists, trad economists, behavioral economists,
and antitrust lawyers all study Amazon and come away pointing at the
same sleazy tactic as being at the heart of the scam, it feels like
maybe we’re having A Moment. What’s more, all of this is so thoroughly
presaged by Khan’s 2018 paper that it suggests that she’s a bona fide
prophet. The authors of this new paper are pretty confident that this
gimmick violates antitrust law. They point out that it doesn’t matter if
Amazon customers feel like they’re getting a good deal – just as it
doesn’t matter if don’t know that you got charged a higher rate for your
mortgage because you’re Black, that’s still illegal. What’s more,
consumer protection law doesn’t require that the merchant intends to rip
you off. There’s plenty of laws requiring supermarkets to post unit
prices on their shelves. These laws don’t start from the assumption that
supermarkets who don’t use unit pricing are trying to scam you! Rather,
they start from the assumption that you will make better-informed
purchases if you have that information, and so you should get it.
Regulating the presentation of prices is firmly in the purview of
antitrust law, especially consumer welfare antitrust, which fetishizes
low prices above all else. The less competitive a market is, the less
pressure a company will feel to offer clear price information to
customers, because those customers will have fewer places to go if they
don’t like the company’s business practices. All of this militates for
antitrust intervention: rules for how Amazon must do its business. The
authors propose three different kinds of rules: I. Force Amazon to halt
its most deceptive practices, like hiding the true price including
shipping or chaffing search results with confusing junk ads. One
fascinating tidbit: just a few days after this paper was published, the
FTC revealed that Amazon had been deliberately cluttering its results
with junk ads in order to juice revenue:
https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/jeff-bezos-urged-amazon-to-flood-search-results-with-junk-ads-ftc.html
II. Mandate interoperability between Amazon and comparison shopping
sites by forcing the company to publish its pricing data in
machine-readable format, and allowing customers to authorize shopping
bots to access their purchasing data to help them figure out how to get
a better deal. Another fascinating turn – the same week this paper came
out, the CFPB proposed a rule that would force your bank to do the same
thing – let you forward your data to comparison shopping sites that
would tell you which bank you’d get the best deal from:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/21/let-my-dollars-go/#personal-financial-data-rights
The CFPB rule goes one step further, strictly limiting how those
comparison sites can use your data, banning them from retaining, selling
or sharing it or using it to target ads to you. This is the approach
that my EFF colleague Bennett Cyphers and I proposed in our “Privacy
Without Monopoly” paper:
https://www.eff.org/wp/interoperability-and-privacy III. Create legal
safe harbors for scraping. Scraping is a form of “adversarial
interoperability,” the self-help measures that technologists use to
modify and adapt existing services without their owners’ consent. Think
of reverse-engineering, bots, etc:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability
Comparison shopping sites have historically relied on scraping to help
their users get better deals. Amazon almost certainly scrapes its
competitors’ sites to figure out if a merchant is selling more cheaply
elsewhere (these merchants are punished by being banished to screen
eleventy-million of the search results, which has the same effect of
just kicking them off of Amazon). Scraping was once the norm online,
then it dwindled, as monopolists used their cash reserves and market
power to get governments to punish rivals that used it. But scraping is
a very important backstop to any kind of price-analysis. Though Mario
Zechner used grocery stores’ own official APIs to prove that they were
colluding to rig prices, he has gone on record to say that he would also
use scraping if they shut down those gateways or denied him access to
them: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/17/how-to-think-about-scraping/ In
my latest nonfiction book, The Internet Con, I lay out virtually the
same program for addressing monopoly power in every tech industry:
https://www.versobooks.com/products/3035-the-internet-con I. Start with
traditional antitrust remedies (breakups, bans on unfair or deceptive
practices) II. Mandatory APIs that allow tinkerers, co-ops, nonprofits,
and startups to interface with dominant platforms and offer their users
and suppliers better services and deals; III. Safe harbors for
adversarial interoperability, so that when companies cheat on their
mandatory APIs by blocking or degrading them, those rival services can
keep things going while they wait for fact-intensive regulatory
proceedings to force the big companies back into compliance. Reading
this new paper, I was struck by how much convergence there is among
different kinds of practitioners, working against the digital sins of
very different kinds of businesses. From the CFPB using mandates and
privacy rules to fight bank ripoffs to behavioral economists thinking
about Amazon’s manipulative search results. This kind of convergence is
exciting as hell. After years of pretending that Big Tech was good for
“consumers,” we’ve not only woken up to how destructive these companies
are, but we’re also all increasingly in accord about what to do about
it. Hot damn! (Image: Doc Searls, CC BY 2.0, modified) Hey look at this

<h2 id="blinken-heads-to-japan-for-g7">Blinken Heads to Japan for
G7</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed Monday that the
United States maintains its focus on the Indo-Pacific region despite
concurrent global challenges, such as the Israel-Hamas conflict.</p>
<p>At the Ankara airport, after concluding a two-and-a-half-hour
discussion with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Blinken said,
“Even as we intensely focus on the crisis in Gaza, we are equally
engaged in the vital work in the Indo-Pacific and other parts of the
world to advance American interests.”</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat will arrive in Tokyo on Tuesday for the Group
of Seven foreign ministers’ meetings and bilateral talks.  </p>
<p>Blinken said he plans to debrief his counterparts from G7 about the
recent Middle East visit.</p>
<p>Japan chairs this year’s G7.  Supporting Ukraine’s economic recovery
and energy needs, as well as regional security are on the agenda in
Blinken’s bilateral meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida
and Foreign Minster Yoko Kamikawa.</p>
<p>Kishida just returned from Manila and Kuala Lumpur where he confirmed
that Japan will promote bilateral defense and maritime security
cooperation with the Philippines and Malaysia. </p>
<p>On Sunday, Kishida, during a joint news conference with Malaysian
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, announced that both countries had agreed
to “accelerate adjustments towards the implementation” of the official
security assistance grant program, known as OSA.</p>
<p>Japan has designated four Asia-Pacific countries — Bangladesh, Fiji,
Malaysia, and the Philippines — as recipients of the OSA. Under this
program, Japan provides materials, equipment and assistance for
infrastructure development based on the security needs of these
countries.</p>
<p>In Manila, Kishida and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the
Philippines confirmed Friday that both countries would start
negotiations on a reciprocal access agreement, a new bilateral deal
aimed at strengthening defense cooperation.  </p>
<p>Japan also agreed to provide the Philippines with coastal radar
systems under the OSA program.</p>
<p>Both the Philippines and Japan have been seeking to enhance
trilateral defense ties with the United States in response to what they
perceive as China’s increasing military aggression in the East and South
China Sea.</p>
<p>Japan rejects China’s sovereignty claims over the Senkaku Islands
located in the East China Sea.  The Philippines and China are on a
collision course over the contested South China Sea, as shown in last
month’s incident in which Chinese ships blocked and collided with two
Philippine vessels near the Second Thomas Shoal.</p>
<p>Following the collision, U.S. President Joe Biden reiterated
Washington’s “ironclad” defense commitment to the Philippines. </p>
<p>The United States has supported Japan’s decision to discharge treated
radioactive water from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into
the Pacific Ocean in August.  Blinken said on August 15 that the U.S. is
satisfied with Japan’s “safe, transparent, and science-based
process.”</p>
<p>But despite assurances from Kishida’s government and external
monitors including the International Atomic Energy Agency, the move has
brought furious opposition from neighboring countries and environmental
organizations who questioned its safety.</p>
<p>China, for example, has banned all seafood imports from Japan. 
Beijing’s fierce protest also came at a time of increased geopolitical
tensions between Japan and China.</p>
<p>“The PRC is hypocritically banning Japanese seafood while fishing
from Japan’s waters for the exact same fish. Can’t blame them since the
fish is outstanding but can blame them for their hypocrisy. America is
sending this fish to a more deserving market: our U.S. military service
members and their families,” said U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel
in a social media posting on X, formerly known as Twitter.  He was
referring to People’s Republic of China. </p>
<p>Before heading to Asia, Blinken was in Israel, Jordan, West Bank,
Iraq and Turkey where he reaffirmed Washington’s support for
humanitarian pauses in Gaza to allow the delivery of lifesaving aid to
civilians as Israel intensifies its offensive on Hamas targets in the
Gaza Strip.</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero</a> is an incredibly

<blockquote>
<p>
These types of hacks have been possible for decades, but they require
special equipment and a fair amount of expertise. The capabilities
generally required expensive SDRs­—short for software-defined
radios­—that, unlike traditional hardware-defined radios, use firmware
and processors to digitally re-create radio signal transmissions and
receptions. The $200 Flipper Zero isn’t an SDR in its own right, but as
a software-controlled radio, it can do many of the same things at an
affordable price and with a form factor that’s much more convenient than
the previous generations of SDRs…

<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Several recommendations this morning with a common theme.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/06/26/baseballScene.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">The
latest <a href="https://500songs.com/">500 songs podcast</a> is about
<a href="https://500songs.com/podcast/episode-169-piece-of-my-heart-by-big-brother-and-the-holding-company/">Janis
Joplin</a>. Of course I listened to Joplin in the early 70s, and I
remember where I was when I heard of her death. I always assumed she was
the freak she presented herself as, that her singing came from her soul,
but I learned from this episode that wasn’t what we were seeing. That’s
what makes this podcast so interesting, it tells me about myself before
I developed my fine-tuned skepticism, as we review the music of my
Boomer life. I tended to believe the stories I was told. When I was a
kid I loved to read biographies, but as time went by I knew some of the
people who had bios written about them, in fact short bios were written
about me in magazines. Since then I understand that the story and the
actual person often have very little to do with each other.
</p>
<p>
A similar story, a
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81712015">biography</a> of
<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/it-aint-over/">Yogi Berra</a>,
that makes you want to cry for love of the man and for the tragedy that
his fame as a character, obscured the fame he deserves as an athlete.
This version of the story is that the personality and the player were
the same person, that without the sense he had of other people and
strong sense of self, he wouldn’t have been nearly as great on the
field. Very emotional for me, and it did change how I look at the
Yankees (I’m a Mets fan from a family of Dodgers fans), and I never
really appreciated him when he became a coach and then manager of the
Mets. I always felt the two teams couldn’t integrate that way. A
well-told story, I hope some of it is true. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
Finally a Fresh Air interview with
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/11/01/1197958207/fresh-air-draft-11-01-2023">David
Byrne</a> of the Talking Heads. A very different personality from Janis
or Yogi, obviously. I love the Talking Heads music, esp these days –
it’s the best Peloton music. The interview is eye-opening, as he
explains how he put his stage personality together and why he switched
from violin to guitar as a kid. He also exudes confidence from a person
who packaged his discomfort with himself as his message.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t realize until I wrote this up how well these three bits go with
each other.

id="californians-bet-farming-agave-is-key-to-weathering-drought-groundwater-limits">Californians
Bet Farming Agave is Key to Weathering Drought, Groundwater Limits</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Leo Ortega started growing spiky blue agave plants on the arid
hillsides around his Southern California home because his wife liked the
way they looked.</p>
<p>A decade later, his property is now dotted with thousands of what he
and others hope is a promising new crop for the state following years of
punishing drought and a push to scale back on groundwater pumping.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old mechanical engineer is one of a growing number of
Californians planting agave to be harvested and used to make spirits,
much like the way tequila and mezcal are made in Mexico. The trend is
fueled by the need to find hardy crops that don’t need much water and a
booming appetite for premium alcoholic beverages since the COVID-19
pandemic.</p>
<p>It’s attracted entrepreneurs such as Ortega, as well as some
California farmers. They’re seeking to shift to more water-efficient
crops and irrigation methods to avoid fallowing their fields with
looming limits on how much groundwater they can pump, as well as more
extreme weather patterns anticipated with climate change. Agave, unlike
most other crops, thrives on almost no water.</p>
<p>“When we were watering them, they didn’t really grow much, and the
ones that weren’t watered were actually growing better,” Ortega said,
walking past rows of the succulents.</p>
<p>He is now investing in a distillery after his initial batches of
spirits, made from Agave americana, sold for $160 a bottle.</p>
<p>Consumers started spending more on high-quality spirits during the
pandemic shutdowns, which spurred a rise in premium beverage products,
said Erlinda A. Doherty, an agave spirits expert and consultant.</p>
<p>Tequila and mezcal were the second-fastest growing spirit category in
the country in 2022, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the
United States.</p>
<p>Both are proprietary spirits under Mexican laws, which are recognized
in U.S. trade agreements. Much like how champagne hails from a region of
France, anything called tequila must contain at least 51% blue Weber
agave and be distilled in Jalisco or a handful of other Mexican states.
Mezcal can be made from a variety of agave types but must be produced in
certain Mexican states.</p>
<p>Agave growers and distillers in California — as well as some in Texas
and Arizona — are betting there is an appetite for more agave-based
spirits even if they are produced outside of Mexico and not called
tequila or mezcal.</p>
<p>“We seem to have this insatiable thirst for agave, so why not have a
domestically grown supply?” Doherty said. “I am kind of bullish on
it.”</p>
<p>Alfonso Mojica Navarro, director of the Mexican Chamber of the
Tequila Industry, said tequila has a lengthy history, global reputation
for excellence and close connection with Mexican culture. While he
didn’t comment specifically on California’s foray into agave spirits, he
said he believes Mexico can respond to the growing demand.</p>
<p>“The tequila industry is concerned that each time there are more
players trying to take advantage of tequila’s success by producing agave
spirits, liqueurs or other beverages that allude to the Mexican drink,
its origins and characteristics despite not being the same,” he said in
a statement.</p>
<p>Agave isn’t grown on a large scale in California yet, and it would
take years for that to happen. But spirits, made by cooking the plant’s
core to produce sugars that are fermented, are proving popular, said
Ventura Spirits owner Henry Tarmy, who distilled his first batch five
years ago.</p>
<p>“We’ve sold everything we’ve made,” he said.</p>
<p>Much like Mexico has, California is taking steps to protect its
nascent industry. The state legislature enacted a law last year
requiring “California agave spirits” be made solely with plants grown in
the state and without additives.</p>
<p>A dozen growers and a handful of distillers also formed the
California Agave Council last year, and the group has tripled in size
since then, said Craig Reynolds, the founding director who planted agave
in the Northern California community of Davis. He said those making
agave spirits have a deep appreciation for Mexican tequila.</p>
<p>“We have about 45 member growers,” he said. “All of them want more
plants.”</p>
<p>Agave takes little water but presents other challenges. The plant
typically takes at least seven years to grow and is tough to harvest,
and a mature plant can weigh hundreds of pounds. Once cut, it has to be
grown all over again.</p>
<p>Still, many see agave as a viable alternative as California — which
supplies the bulk of the country’s produce — explores ways to cut back
water use.</p>
<p>While record rain and snowfall over the winter mostly ended a
three-year drought in California, more dry periods are likely in store.
The state enacted a law nearly a decade ago to regulate the pumping of
groundwater after excessive pumping led some residents’ wells to run dry
and the land to sink. Scientists expect extreme weather patterns will
become even more common as the planet warms, causing more drought.</p>
<p>Stuart Woolf, who grows tomatoes and almonds in the state’s crop-rich
Central Valley, said he started thinking about agave after estimating
he’ll only be able to farm about 60% of his land in 20 years due to
water limitations. And that’s despite investing in solar energy and
groundwater recharge projects to protect the farm that has been in his
family for generations.</p>
<p>After trying out a test plot a few years ago, Woolf went on to plant
some 200,000 agave on land he otherwise would have fallowed. Each acre
of agave is taking only 7.6 centimeters (3 inches) of water a year — a
tenth of what row crops demand and even less than pistachio and almond
trees, he said.</p>
<p>Woolf and his wife Lisa gave a $100,000 donation to the University of
California, Davis, which formed a research fund to look at the
succulent’s varieties and its potential as a low-water crop.</p>
<p>“I have been trying to figure out what is a crop that I can grow that
is somewhat climate-resilient, drought-tolerant, so I can utilize our
land,” Woolf said. “The amount of water I am giving them is so low, I
don’t think I am ever going to have a problem.”</p>

id="trump-testifies-at-ny-fraud-trial-that-property-estimates-were-inaccurate">Trump
Testifies at NY Fraud Trial That Property Estimates Were Inaccurate</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Donald Trump on Monday testified that his company did not provide
accurate estimates of many of his properties in a rambling and defiant
performance on the witness stand in a civil fraud trial in New York.</p>
<p>The former U.S. president said his company undervalued his Mar-a-Lago
estate and Doral golf course in Florida and overvalued his Trump Tower
apartment, among other assets, but sought to minimize the importance of
the estimates, which state lawyers said were inflated to win better
financing terms.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t important. You’ve made it important, but it wasn’t,” Trump
said of the estimates.  </p>
<p>Judge Arthur Engoron has already ruled those estimates to be
fraudulent. New York state lawyers argued in their lawsuit that the
estimates misled lenders and insurers, earning him $100 million and
exaggerating his wealth by $2 billion.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly said the case is “witch hunt” and has accused
Engoron and New York Attorney General Letitia James of being politically
biased against him.  </p>
<p>He kept up those complaints on the witness stand, where he accused
legal authorities of paying unduly close attention to his business after
he won the 2016 presidential election.</p>
<p>“I’m sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules
against me,” he said.  </p>
<p>“This is a very unfair trial,” he added later.  </p>
<p>Trump’s remarks drew a sharp reprimand from Engoron, who threatened
to cut his testimony short.</p>
<p>“Mr Kise, can you control your client? This is not a political rally.
This is a courtroom,” Engoron asked Trump’s lawyer, Christopher Kise.
 </p>
<p>James brushed aside Trump’s attacks.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, the only thing that matters are the facts and
the numbers. The numbers, my friends, don’t lie,” James said outside the
courthouse before Trump’s testimony.</p>
<p>Unlike the four criminal cases the frontrunner for the 2024
Republican presidential nomination faces, this civil trial does not
threaten to put him in prison as he mounts a comeback White House
bid.</p>
<p>Indeed, Trump has sought to take advantage of the legal cases, using
them to solicit campaign donations and argue that he is being targeted
for his political views.</p>
<p>But the civil fraud case against Trump and his business could
undercut his image, cultivated over decades, as a glamorous billionaire
who shuttles between elegant resorts and premium golf courses that bear
his name.  </p>
<p>James is seeking $250 million in fines, as well as restrictions that
would prevent Trump and his sons Eric and Donald Jr. from doing business
in their home state.  </p>
<p>In testimony last week, both sons said they were unfamiliar with the
details of the valuation documents. Trump made that argument as well,
saying accountants did the bulk of the work.</p>
<p>Engoron has already canceled business certificates for companies that
control large portions of his business, though that order is on hold
during appeal.</p>
<p>Evidence introduced at trial so far has revealed that company
officials, including Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr., tried to
manipulate the assessed value of trophy properties like the Mar-a-Lago
estate in Florida.  </p>
<p>One witness, his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, testified
that Trump directed him to doctor financial statements to boost his net
worth.  </p>
<p>Trump’s anger has been clear throughout.  </p>
<p>Though his presence until Monday has not been required in court, he
has already appeared several times to glower at the proceedings from the
defendant’s table and complain about the case to TV cameras outside the
chamber.</p>
<p>That has earned him fines of $15,000 for twice violating a limited
gag order that prevents him from criticizing court staff. Trump’s
lawyers have chafed at that order and indicated they might use it as the
basis for an appeal, but Engoron expanded it on Friday to cover them as
well.</p>
<p>Trump’s crowded legal calendar threatens to take him off the campaign
trail for much of next year.  </p>
<p>His election campaign’s written fundraising appeals at the outset of
the trial on Oct. 2 said Trump was defending his family and reputation
from New York Democrats, calling them “corrupt tyrants.”</p>
<p>Republican voters do not seem to be bothered by his legal woes, as
opinion polls show he holds a commanding lead in the party’s
presidential nominating contest.</p>
<p>The trial was originally scheduled to run through early December but
could wrap up sooner as the state calls its final witnesses this week.
It is unclear how many witnesses the defense will call.  </p>
<p>Trump’s daughter Ivanka is due to testify on Wednesday, though she is
not a defendant in the case.</p>

CDC to Expand Surveillance of Travelers for Respiratory Viruses</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will expand
its traveler-based surveillance program to include testing for
respiratory viruses, partners Ginkgo Bioworks and XWELL said on
Monday.</p>
<p>The expansion, to be launched at four of the seven participating
airports, comes ahead of the fall and winter months in the United States
when viruses that cause respiratory diseases such as influenza and
respiratory synctial virus (RSV) usually circulate more heavily.</p>
<p>CDC has warned that it expects hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV
infections and flu this year to be similar to last year’s numbers,
higher than the pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Ginkgo and XWELL said they will monitor over 30 new viruses,
bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance targets including seasonal
respiratory pathogens such as influenza A and B, RSV, and SARS-CoV-2 as
part of the expansion.</p>
<p>The expansion will launch at New York’s John F. Kennedy International
Airport, San Francisco International Airport, Boston Logan International
Airport and Washington Dulles International Airport.</p>
<p>The surveillance program is a public-private partnership between the
health agency, Ginkgo’s biosecurity and public health unit, Concentric,
and XWELL’s diagnostic testing service, XpresCheck.</p>
<p>The agency conducts voluntary nasal swabbing and airport wastewater
sampling as part of the program, aimed to help with early detection of
new SARS-CoV-2 variants and other pathogens.</p>

id="yellen-to-host-chinese-vice-premier-for-talks-in-san-francisco-ahead-of-start-of-apec-summit">Yellen
to Host Chinese Vice Premier for Talks in San Francisco Ahead of Start
of APEC Summit</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will host Chinese Vice Premier
He Lifeng for two days of talks this week, the latest in a series of
high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials as the world’s two
largest economies aim to ease tensions, the Treasury Department
announced Monday.</p>
<p>The Yellen-He talks set for Thursday and Friday come ahead of the
start of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in San Francisco
which starts November 11. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi
Jinping are expected to meet next week during the summit, what would be
the first engagement between the two leaders in nearly a year.</p>
<p>“As a foundation, our two nations have an obligation to establish
resilient lines of open communication and to prevent our disagreements
from spiraling into conflict,” Yellen wrote in a Washington Post op-ed
to spotlight the upcoming meeting. “But we also know that our
relationship cannot be circumscribed to crisis management.”</p>
<p>The meeting between the two senior government officials comes after
Biden spoke with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at the White House for
about an hour late last month, when Beijing’s top diplomat came to
Washington for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Xi similarly met
with Blinken in June when the secretary of State traveled to Beijing for
talks with Wang.</p>
<p>Yellen last met with her counterpart He during a July visit to
Beijing, when she urged Chinese government officials for cooperation on
climate change and other global challenges and not to let sharp
disagreements about trade and other irritants derail relations.</p>
<p>China’s Foreign Ministry said that He, who is the government’s lead
person on U.S.-China economic and trade issues, would visit the U.S.
from Nov. 8-12.</p>
<p>Yellen is expected to amplify the message on climate during her talks
with He in San Francisco. Treasury in a statement said that Yellen will
also underscore that the Biden administration “will take targeted action
to advance our national security and that of our allies, and protect
human rights, but we do not use these tools to seek economic
advantage.”</p>
<p>Tensions between the two countries remain high, including over U.S.
export controls on advanced technology. The Biden administration has
also taken Beijing to task for economic practices that it says have put
U.S. companies and workers at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The U.S. has also criticized China’s lending practices under its $1
trillion Belt and Road Initiative, a network of projects and maritime
lanes that snake around large portions of the world, primarily Asia and
Africa. Critics, including the Biden administration, say China’s
projects often create massive debt and expose nations to undue influence
by Beijing.</p>
<p>Yellen in her op-ed wrote she would raise during the meetings the
administration’s “serious concerns with Beijing’s unfair economic
practices, including its large-scale use of non-market tools, its
barriers to market access and its coercive actions against U.S. firms in
China.”</p>
<p>The U.S. has also repeatedly raised concerns about China’s assertive
actions in the East and South China seas.</p>
<p>The U.S. military last month released a video of a Chinese fighter
jet flying within 10 feet (three meters) of an American B-52 bomber over
the South China Sea, nearly causing an accident. Earlier in October, the
Pentagon released footage of some of the more than 180 intercepts of
U.S. warplanes by Chinese aircraft that occurred in the last two years,
part of a trend U.S. military officials call concerning.</p>
<p>The U.S. also has renewed a warning that it would defend the
Philippines in case of an armed attack under a security pact, after
Chinese ships blocked and collided with two Philippine vessels off a
contested shoal in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Beijing has released its own video of close encounters in the region,
including what it described as footage of the USS Ralph Johnson making a
sharp turn and crossing in front of the bow of a Chinese navy ship. The
U.S. destroyer also was captured sailing between two Chinese ships.</p>

Houses Being Built to Resist Hurricanes and Cut Emissions</h2>

evacuate. Her house lost only a few shingles, with photos taken after
the storm showing it standing whole amid the wreckage of almost all the
surrounding homes.</p>
<p>Some developers are building homes like Paulson’s with an eye toward
making them more resilient to the extreme weather that’s increasing with
climate change, and friendlier to the environment at the same time.
Solar panels, for example, installed so snugly that high winds can’t get
underneath them, mean clean power that can survive a storm. Preserved
wetlands and native vegetation that trap carbon in the ground and reduce
flooding vulnerability, too. Recycled or advanced construction materials
that reduce energy use as well as the need to make new material.</p>
<p>A person’s home is one of the biggest ways they can reduce their
individual carbon footprint. Buildings release about 38% of all
energy-related greenhouse gas emissions each year. Some of the carbon
pollution comes from powering things like lights and air conditioners
and some of it from making the construction materials, like concrete and
steel.</p>
<p>Deltec, the company that built Paulson’s home, says that only one of
the nearly 1,400 homes it’s built over the last three decades has
suffered structural damage from hurricane-force winds. But the company
puts as much emphasis on building green, with higher-quality insulation
that reduces the need for air conditioning, heat pumps for more
efficient heating and cooling, energy-efficient appliances, and of
course solar.</p>
<p>“The real magic here is that we’re doing both,” chief executive Steve
Linton. “I think a lot of times resilience is sort of the afterthought
when you talk about sustainable construction, where it’s just kind of
this is a feature on a list … we believe that resilience is really a
fundamental part of sustainability.”</p>
<p>Other companies are developing entire neighborhoods that are both
resistant to hurricanes and contribute less than average to climate
change.</p>
<p>Pearl Homes’ Mirabella community in Bradenton, Florida, consists of
160 houses that are all LEED-certified platinum, the highest level of
one of the most-used green building rating systems.</p>
<p>To reduce vulnerability to flooding, home sites are raised 3 feet
above code. Roads are raised, too, and designed to direct accumulating
rainfall away and onto ground where it may be absorbed. Steel roofs with
seams allow solar panels to be attached so closely it’s difficult for
high winds to get under them, and the homes have batteries that kick in
when power is knocked out.</p>
<p>Pearl Homes CEO Marshall Gobuty said his team approached the
University of Central Florida with a plan to build a community that
doesn’t contribute to climate change. “I wanted them to be not just
sustainable, but resilient, I wanted them to be so unlike everything
else that goes on in Florida,” Gobuty said. “I see homes that are newly
built, half a mile away, that are underwater … we are in a crisis with
how the weather is changing.”</p>
<p>That resonates with Paulson, in Mexico Beach, who said she didn’t
want to “live day to day worried about tracking something in the
Atlantic.” Besides greater peace of mind, she says, she’s now enjoying
energy costs of about $32 per month, far below the roughly $250 she said
she paid in a previous home.</p>
<p>“I don’t really feel that the population is taking into effect the
environmental catastrophes, and adjusting for it,” she said. “We’re
building the same old stuff that got blown away.”</p>
<p>Babcock Ranch is another sustainable, hurricane-resilient community
in South Florida. It calls itself the first solar-powered town in the
U.S., generating 150 megawatts of electricity with 680,000 panels on 870
acres. The community was also one of the first in the country to have
large batteries on site to store extra solar power to use at night or
when the power is out.</p>
<p>Syd Kitson founded Babcock Ranch in 2006. The homes are better able
to withstand hurricane winds because the roofs are strapped to a system
that connects down to the foundation. Power lines are buried underground
so they can’t blow over. The doors swing outward in some homes so when
pressure builds up from the wind, they don’t blast open, and vents help
balance the pressure in garages.</p>
<p>In 2022 Hurricane Ian churned over Babcock Ranch as a Category 4
storm. It left little to no damage, Kitson said.</p>
<p>“We set out to prove that a new town and the environment can work
hand-in-hand, and I think we’ve proven that,” said Kitson. “Unless you
build in a very resilient way, you’re just going to constantly be
repairing or demolishing the home.”</p>
<p>The development sold some 73,000 acres of its site to the state for
wetland preservation, and on the land where it was built, a team studied
how water naturally flows through the local environment and incorporated
it into its water management system.</p>
<p>“That water is going to go where it wants to go, if you’re going to
try and challenge Mother Nature, you’re going to lose every single
time,” said Kitson. The wetlands, retention ponds, and native vegetation
are better able to manage water during extreme rainfall, reducing the
risk of flooded homes.</p>
<p>In the Florida Keys, Natalia Padalino and her husband, Alan Klingler,
plan to finish building a Deltec home by December. The couple was
concerned about the future impacts global warming and hurricanes would
have on the Florida Keys and researched homes that were both sustainable
and designed to withstand these storms.</p>
<p>“We believe we’re building something that’s going to be a phenomenal
investment and reduce our risk of any major catastrophic situation,”
Klingler said.</p>
<p>“People have been really open and receptive. They tell us if a
hurricane comes, they’re going to be staying in our place,” Padalino
said.</p>

<h2 id="pyenv-venv-and-weasyprint">pyenv, venv and weasyprint</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
pyenv, venv and weasyprint
</h1>
<p>
I’m not a big Python-using programmer and so I lack the experience to
handle unexpected issues. Yesterday I ran into something I think is
worth documenting for myself. Perhaps I’ll run into it in another year’s
time.
</p>
<p>
The symptom I noticed yesterday was that weasyprint wouldn’t hyphenate
the PDFs I was generating. I suspected that it might be related to the
recent <a href="2023-10-18-from-pureos-to-debian" rel="nofollow">switch
to Debian 12</a>.
</p>
<p>
I installed weasyprint again:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install weasyprint
</code></pre>
<p>
That seemed to have no effect. So I decided I’d like to install
weasyprint from PyPI again.
</p>
<pre><code>pip3 install weasyprint
</code></pre>
<p>
This resulted in a strange error:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Could not fetch URL
<a href="https://pypi.org/simple/weasyprint/:" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.org/simple/weasyprint/:</a>
There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate:
HTTPSConnectionPool(host=‘pypi.org’, port=443): Max retries exceeded
with url: /simple/weasyprint/ (Caused by SSLError(“Can’t connect to
HTTPS URL because the SSL module is not available.”)) - skipping
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It took me a while to understand what this was about.
</p>
<p>
I rediscovered that I was running pyenv when I tried to verify the
Python version I was running:
</p>
<pre><code>$ which pip3
/home/alex/.pyenv/shims/pip3
</code></pre>
<p>
I had installed pyenv so I was using my own self-compiled Python which
was in fact missing the SSL library it had been compiled against. I
suspect that it’s the same disappearing library that caused me so much
headache when I moved to Debian 12: libcrypt1.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://social.coop/@jonny" title="@jonny@social.coop" rel="nofollow"><span
class="citation" data-cites="jonny">@jonny</span></a> helped me realize
that uninstalling it all might be the answer.
</p>
<p>
I wasn’t quite sure how to uninstall pyenv. I could uninstall the
environment I was using, but it kept listing it as unavailable. Then I
remembered why I had installed pyenv in the first place: I had needed a
newer Python to install the latest weasyprint! Since I now had a newer
system Ptyhon I probably didn’t need pyenv any more and so I deleted
what I found in “<em>/.local” and the line I had added to
“</em>/.config/fish/config.fish” and restarted my shell.
</p>
<p>
When I tried to install weasyprint using my system’s pip, it warned me
about messing up my system’s Python and recommended using a virtual
environment. This seems reasonable and so that’s what I did.
</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt install python3.11-venv
mkdir ~/.local/weasyprint
python3 -m venv .local/weasyprint/
.local/weasyprint/bin/pip install weasyprint
cd /home/alex/.local/bin/
rm weasyprint
ln -s ~/.local/weasyprint/bin/weasyprint .
</code></pre>
<p>
And now hyphenation works again!
</p>
<p>

weasyprint here:

Leave to Join Mexico Migrant Caravan Headed for US</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A caravan of at least hundreds of migrants left from the southern
Mexican city of Tapachula on Sunday heading for the U.S. southern
border.</p>
<p>The smaller caravan plans to join a larger one that left six days ago
and is currently stopped about 40 kilometers north of the town of
Huixtla.</p>
<p>Organizers said the first had swelled to some 7,000 people while the
government in the southern Chiapas state said it estimated the group at
3,500 people.</p>
<p>Many migrants are fleeing poverty and political instability in their
homelands, hailing from Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, and
especially Honduras and Venezuela, according to a Reuters witness.</p>
<p>“I think 3.4 months is too long to wait to get a humanitarian visa,
to be able to travel through Mexican territory,” said Selma Alvarez from
Venezuela. “Because we are at the mercy of coyotes, of criminals, it is
good that we accompany each other in the caravan. It seems safer to
me.”</p>
<p>Alvarez added that the group was impatient to get to the U.S. border
and start the process to enter the U.S. with appointments secured via a
U.S. government app, CBP One, and request asylum.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden, who is seeking reelection next year, is
under pressure to lower the number of people crossing illegally into the
U.S. from Mexico.</p>
<p>A record number of people this year have crossed the Darien Gap
region connecting Panama and Colombia.</p>

in Iraq: Attack on US Forces Violates Iraq’s Sovereignty</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a surprise visit Sunday
to Baghdad, where he met with Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia
al-Sudani.</p>
<p>Blinken urged the Iraqi prime minister to hold accountable those
responsible for continuing attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq and fulfill
Iraq’s commitments to protect all installations hosting U.S. personnel
at the invitation of the Iraqi government.</p>
<p>U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have been attacked with drones or
rockets in recent days, as more U.S. forces deploy to the Middle East to
support regional deterrence efforts. U.S. military officials have blamed
Iranian-backed proxies for the near-daily attacks on U.S. forces.</p>
<p>Blinken received a security briefing on the threat to U.S. facilities
at the U.S. Embassy prior to his talks with al-Sudani, which lasted for
more than an hour.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after the meeting Sunday, Blinken said
al-Sudani is “working with his own security forces and others to take
necessary action” to deal with attacks on U.S. forces and to prevent
further attacks.</p>
<p>“This is a matter of Iraqi sovereignty. No country wants to have
militia groups engaged in violent activity,” Blinken said at a news
conference Sunday.</p>
<p>“We have a shared purpose and commitment in trying to make sure that
these attacks don’t happen,” he added.</p>
<p>Al-Sudani has spoken out against those attacks. He reportedly will
begin a regional tour to Iran and the Persian Gulf nations Monday.</p>
<p>Blinken and al-Sudani also discussed the need to prevent the conflict
between Israel and Hamas from spreading, including in Iraq.</p>
<p>In a phone call on October 23, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin
thanked al-Sudani for reaffirming the Iraqi government’s full commitment
to protect U.S. forces in Iraq.</p>
<p>Earlier Sunday, Blinken held talks with Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas in another unannounced visit to the West Bank,
reaffirming the U.S. commitment to deliver lifesaving humanitarian
assistance and resume essential services in Gaza as Israel’s war against
Hamas intensifies.</p>
<p>Blinken told reporters that he and Abbas agreed that it is critical
for the Palestinian Authority to play a leading role in the future of
Gaza.</p>
<p>“With regard to [the] future of Gaza and the West Bank, Palestinian
views, Palestinian voices, Palestinian aspirations need to be at the
center of that,” Blinken said Sunday. “The Palestinian Authority is the
representative of those voices so it’s important that they play a
leading role.”</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat was headed to Turkey, where he will hold talks
with officials in Ankara.</p>

</p>
<p>
By default, the Raspberry Pi 5 (like the Pi 4 before it) leaves the SoC
powered up (just in a shutdown state) when you shut down the Pi.
</p>
<p>
Because of this, a Pi 5 will still sit there consuming 1.2-1.6W when
completely shut down, even without <em>anything</em> plugged in except
power.
</p>
<p>
That’s a lot—even compared to a modern desktop PC!
</p>
<p>
Why is this?
</p>
<p>
Apparently
<a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?p=1498465&hilit=POWER_OFF_ON_HALT+3v3+hat#p1498465">some
HATs have trouble if the 3v3 power rail is off, but 5v is still
active</a>—which would be the case if you completely power off the SoC,
but still have your 5V power supply plugged in.
</p>
<p>
Because of that, the Pi ships by default with the setting
<code>POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0</code>, and the Pi eats up precious watts all
the time.

<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>WinRAR has a massive security hole that’s still being actively
exploited, and it’s one of many Windows applications that do not
auto-update. The developer boasts of more than 500 million WinRAR
installations around the world, so it’s likely that hundreds of millions
of PCs are vulnerable to malicious ZIP files today. How is it that, in
2023, the world’s most popular desktop operating system doesn’t provide
an easy way to update your installed applications? It baffles me that
Windows and macOS users still have to manually keep track of and update
each and every one of their applications individually, like it’s 1997 or
something. Stay safe. It’s the wild west out there for some of you.</p>

<p>Google engineers on Wednesday posted an initial “request for

the Linux kernel in the Rust programming language rather than C. Binder
remains a critical piece of Android’s software stack and for increasing
the robustness and security, Google is pursuing a rewrite of the C code
in Rust. Binder is responsible for inter-process communication (IPC) and
other tasks on Android while replacing it with memory-safe Rust code
should be a big step-up for system security. Rust is everywhere.</p>

Tola Sets NYC Marathon Course Record to Win Men’s Race; Hellen Obiri
Takes Women’s Title</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tamirat Tola of Ethiopia set a course record to win the New York City
Marathon men’s race on Sunday while Hellen Obiri of Kenya pulled away in
the final 400 meters to take the women’s title.</p>
<p>Tola finished in 2 hours, 4 minutes and 58 seconds, topping the
2:05.06 set by Geoffrey Mutai in 2011. Tola pulled away from countrymate
Jemal Yimer when the pair were heading toward the Bronx at mile 20. By
the time Tola headed back into Manhattan a mile later he was up by 19
seconds and left only chasing Mutai’s mark.</p>
<p>Albert Korir of Kenya, who won the 2021 NYC Marathon, finished second
nearly 2 minutes behind Tola.</p>
<p>While the men’s race was well decided before the last few miles, the
women’s race came down to the stretch. Obiri, Letesenbet Gidey of
Ethiopia and defending champion Sharon Lokedi were all running together
exchanging the lead. Obiri made a move as the trio headed back into
Central Park for the final half-mile and finished in 2:27.23. Gidey
finished second, 6 seconds behind.</p>
<p>Lokedi was 10 seconds behind Obiri, who won the Boston Marathon in
April.</p>
<p>This was a stellar women’s field that was expected to potentially
take down the course record of 2:22:31 set by Margaret Okayo in 2003.
Unlike last year when the weather was unseasonably warm with
temperatures in the 70s, Sunday’s race was much cooler with it being in
the 50s — ideal conditions for record breaking times and for the 50,000
runners.</p>
<p>Instead the women had a tactical race with 11 runners, including
Americans Kellyn Taylor and Molly Huddle in the lead pack for the first
20 miles. Taylor and Huddle both led the group at points before falling
back and finishing in eighth and ninth.</p>
<p>Once the lead group came back into Manhattan for the final few miles,
Obiri, Gidey and Lokedi pushed the pace.</p>
<p>As the trio entered Central Park they further distanced themselves
from Kenya’s Brigid Kosgei, who finished fourth.</p>
<p>The men’s and women’s winners finished within a few minutes of each
other. About an hour earlier, Marcel Hug won the men’s wheelchair race,
finishing a few seconds short of his own course record by finishing in
1:25.29. It was the Swiss star’s record-extending sixth NYC Marathon
victory.</p>
<p>“It’s incredible. I think it takes some time to realize what
happened,” Hug said. “I’m so happy as well.”</p>
<p>He’s the most decorated champion in the wheelchair race at the event,
breaking a tie with Tatyana McFadden and Kurt Fearnley for most wins in
the division in event history.</p>
<p>Catherine Debrunner of Switzerland won her New York debut, shattering
the course record in the women’s wheelchair race. She finished in
1:39.32, besting the previous mark by over 3 minutes, which was held by
American Susannah Scaroni.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to describe in words. I said to my coach if I win
this race, it’s the best performance I ever showed,” she said. “Knew
it’s the toughest marathon of all. It was the first time. I knew it was
going to be so tough.”</p>
<p>Debrunner and Tola both earned a $50,000 bonus for topping the
previous course records.</p>
<p>Tickets to Paris</p>
<p>Daniel Romanchuk and Aaron Pike qualified for the 2024 Paris Games by
finishing as the top Americans in the men’s wheelchair race. Scaroni and
McFadden qualified on the women’s side for the Olympics.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links A link-clump demands a linkdump: Fit the ninth. This
day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading A
link-clump demands a linkdump (permalink) Cometh the weekend, cometh the
linkdump. My daily-ish newsletter includes a section called “Hey look at
this,” with three short links per day, but sometimes those links get
backed up and I need to clean house. Here’s the eight previous
installments: https://pluralistic.net/tag/linkdump/ The country code top
level domain (ccTLD) for the Caribbean island nation of Anguilla is .ai,
and that’s turned into millions of dollars worth of royalties as
“entrepreneurs” scramble to sprinkle some buzzword-compliant AI stuff on
their businesses in the most superficial way possible:
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/ai-fever-turns-anguillas-ai-domain-into-a-digital-gold-mine/
All told, .ai domain royalties will account for about ten percent of the
country’s GDP. It’s actually kind of nice to see Anguilla finding some
internet money at long last. Back in the 1990s, when I was a freelance
web developer, I got hired to work on the investor website for a
publicly traded internet casino based in Anguilla that was a scammy
disaster in every conceivable way. The company had been conceived of by
people who inherited a modestly successful chain of print-shops and
decided to diversify by buying a dormant penny mining stock and
relaunching it as an online casino. But of course, online casinos were
illegal nearly everywhere. Not in Anguilla – or at least, that’s what
the founders told us – which is why they located their servers there,
despite the lack of broadband or, indeed, reliable electricity at their
data-center. At a certain point, the whole thing started to whiff of a
stock swindle, a pump-and-dump where they’d sell off shares in that
ex-mining stock to people who knew even less about the internet than
they did and skedaddle. I got out, and lost track of them, and a search
for their names and business today turns up nothing so I assume that it
flamed out before it could ruin any retail investors’ lives. Anguilla is
a British Overseas Territory, one of those former British colonies that
was drained and then given “independence” by paternalistic imperial
administrators half a world away. The country’s main industries are
tourism and “finance” – which is to say, it’s a pearl in the
globe-spanning necklace of tax- and corporate-crime-havens the UK
established around the world so its most vicious criminals – the
hereditary aristocracy – can continue to use Britain’s roads and exploit
its educated workforce without paying any taxes. This is the “finance
curse,” and there are tiny, struggling nations all around the world that
live under it. Nick Shaxson dubbed them “Treasure Islands” in his
outstanding book of the same name:
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780230341722/treasureislands I can’t
imagine that the AI bubble will last forever – anything that can’t go on
forever eventually stops – and when it does, those .ai domain royalties
will dry up. But until then, I salute Anguilla, which has at last found
the internet riches that I played a small part in bringing to it in the
previous century. The AI bubble is indeed overdue for a popping, but
while the market remains gripped by irrational exuberance, there’s lots
of weird stuff happening around the edges. Take Inject My PDF, which
embeds repeating blocks of invisible text into your resume:
https://kai-greshake.de/posts/inject-my-pdf/ The text is tuned to make
resume-sorting Large Language Models identify you as the ideal candidate
for the job. It’ll even trick the summarizer function into spitting out
text that does not appear in any human-readable form on your CV.
Embedding weird stuff into resumes is a hacker tradition. I first
encountered it at the Chaos Communications Congress in 2012, when Ang
Cui used it as an example in his stellar “Print Me If You Dare” talk:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njVv7J2azY8 Cui figured out that one way
to update the software of a printer was to embed an invisible Postscript
instruction in a document that basically said, “everything after this is
a firmware update.” Then he came up with 100 lines of perl that he hid
in documents with names like cv.pdf that would flash the printer when
they ran, causing it to probe your LAN for vulnerable PCs and take them
over, opening a reverse-shell to his command-and-control server in the
cloud. Compromised printers would then refuse to apply future updates
from their owners, but would pretend to install them and even update
their version numbers to give verisimilitude to the ruse. The only way
to exorcise these haunted printers was to send ‘em to the landfill. Good
times! Printers are still a dumpster fire, and it’s not solely about the
intrinsic difficulty of computer security. After all, printer
manufacturers have devoted enormous resources to hardening their
products against their owners, making it progressively harder to use
third-party ink. They’re super perverse about it, too – they send
“security updates” to your printer that update the printer’s security
against you – run these updates and your printer downgrades itself by
refusing to use the ink you chose for it:
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer
It’s a reminder that what a monopolist thinks of as “security” isn’t
what you think of as security. Oftentimes, their security is
antithetical to your security. That was the case with Web Environment
Integrity, a plan by Google to make your phone rat you out to
advertisers’ servers, revealing any adblocking modifications you might
have installed so that ad-serving companies could refuse to talk to you:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/02/self-incrimination/#wei-bai-bai WEI
is now dead, thanks to a lot of hueing and crying by people like us:
https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/google_abandons_web_environment_integrity/
But the dream of securing Google against its own users lives on. Youtube
has embarked on an aggressive campaign of refusing to show videos to
people running ad-blockers, triggering an arms-race of
ad-blocker-blockers and ad-blocker-blocker-blockers:
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/where-will-the-ad-versus-ad-blocker-arms-race-end/
The folks behind Ublock Origin are racing to keep up with Google’s
engineers’ countermeasures, and there’s a single-serving website called
“Is uBlock Origin updated to the last Anti-Adblocker YouTube script?”
that will give you a realtime, one-word status update:
https://drhyperion451.github.io/does-uBO-bypass-yt/ One in four web
users has an ad-blocker, a stat that Doc Searls pithily summarizes as
“the biggest boycott in world history”:
https://doc.searls.com/2015/09/28/beyond-ad-blocking-the-biggest-boycott-in-human-history/
Zero app users have ad-blockers. That’s not because ad-blocking an app
is harder than ad-blocking the web – it’s because reverse-engineering an
app triggers liability under IP laws like Section 1201 of the Digital
Millenium Copyright Act, which can put you away for 5 years for a first
offense. That’s what I mean when I say that “IP is anything that lets a
company control its customers, critics or competitors:
https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/ I predicted that apps
would open up all kinds of opportunities for abusive, monopolistic
conduct back in 2010, and I’m experiencing a mix of sadness and smugness
(I assume there’s a German word for this emotion) at being so thoroughly
vindicated by history:
https://memex.craphound.com/2010/04/01/why-i-wont-buy-an-ipad-and-think-you-shouldnt-either/
The more control a company can exert over its customers, the worse it
will be tempted to treat them. These systems of control shift the
balance of power within companies, making it harder for internal
factions that defend product quality and customer interests to win
against the enshittifiers:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/microincentives-and-enshittification/
The result has been a Great Enshittening, with platforms of all
description shifting value from their customers and users to their
shareholders, making everything palpably worse. The only bright side is
that this has created the political will to do something about it,
sparking a wave of bold, muscular antitrust action all over the world.
The Google antitrust case is certainly the most important corporate
lawsuit of the century (so far), but Judge Amit Mehta’s deference to
Google’s demands for secrecy has kept the case out of the headlines. I
mean, Sam Bankman-Fried is a psychopathic thief, but even so, his trial
does not deserve its vastly greater prominence, though, if you haven’t
heard yet, he’s been convicted and will face decades in prison after he
exhausts his appeals:
https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/sam-bankman-fried-guilty-on-all-charges
The secrecy around Google’s trial has relaxed somewhat, and the trickle
of revelations emerging from the cracks in the courthouse are
fascinating. For the first time, we’re able to get a concrete sense of
which queries are the most lucrative for Google:

The list comes from 2018, but it’s still wild. As David Pierce writes in
The Verge, the top twenty includes three iPhone-related terms, five
insurance queries, and the rest are overshadowed by searches for
customer service info for monopolistic services like Xfinity, Uber and
Hulu. All-in-all, we’re living through a hell of a moment for piercing
the corporate veil. Maybe it’s the problem of maintaining secrecy within
large companies, or maybe the the rampant mistreatment of even senior
executives has led to more leaks and whistleblowing. Either way, we all
owe a debt of gratitude to the anonymous leaker who revealed the
unbelievable pettiness of former HBO president of programming Casey
Bloys, who ordered his underlings to create an army of sock-puppet
Twitter accounts to harass TV and movie critics who panned HBO’s shows:
https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/hbo-casey-bloys-secret-twitter-trolls-tv-critics-leaked-texts-lawsuit-the-idol-1234867722/
These trolling attempts were pathetic, even by the standards of
thick-fingered corporate execs. Like, accusing critics who panned the
shitty-ass Perry Mason reboot of disrespecting veterans because the
fictional Mason’s back-story had him storming the beach on D-Day. The
pushback against corporate bullying is everywhere, and of course, the
vanguard is the labor movement. Did you hear that the UAW won their
strike against the auto-makers, scoring raises for all workers based on
the increases in the companies’ CEO pay? The UAW isn’t done, either!
Their incredible new leader, Shawn Fain, has called for a general strike
in 2028:

The massive victory for unionized auto-workers has thrown a spotlight on
the terrible working conditions and pay for workers at Tesla, a criminal
company that has no compunctions about violating labor law to prevent
its workers from exercising their legal rights. Over in Sweden, union
workers are teaching Tesla a lesson. After the company tried its illegal
union-busting playbook on Tesla service centers, the unionized
dock-workers issued an ultimatum: respect your workers or face a
blockade at Sweden’s ports that would block any Tesla from being
unloaded into the EU’s fifth largest Tesla market:
https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-sweden-strike/ Of course, the real
solution to Teslas – and every other kind of car – is to redesign our
cities for public transit, walking and cycling, making cars the
exception for deliveries, accessibility and other necessities.
Transitioning to EVs will make a big dent in the climate emergency, but
it won’t make our streets any safer – and they keep getting deadlier.
Last summer, my dear old pal Ted Kulczycky got in touch with me to tell
me that Talking Heads were going to be all present in public for the
first time since the band’s breakup, as part of the debut of the newly
remastered print of Stop Making Sense, the greatest concert movie of all
time. Even better, the show would be in Toronto, my hometown, where Ted
and I went to high-school together, at TIFF. Ted is the only person I
know who is more obsessed with Talking Heads than I am, and he started
working on tickets for the show while I starting pricing plane tickets.
And then, the unthinkable happened: Ted’s wife, Serah, got in touch to
say that Ted had been run over by a car while getting off of a
streetcar, that he was severely injured, and would require multiple
surgeries. But this was Ted, so of course he was still planning to see
the show. And he did, getting a day-pass from the hospital and showing
up looking like someone from a Kids In The Hall sketch who’d been made
up to look like someone who’d been run over by a car:
https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/53182440282/ In his Globe and
Mail article about Ted’s experience, Brad Wheeler describes how the
whole hospital rallied around Ted to make it possible for him to get to
the movie:
https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/article-how-a-talking-heads-superfan-found-healing-with-the-concert-film-stop/
He also mentions that Ted is working on a book and podcast about Stop
Making Sense. I visited Ted in the hospital the day after the gig and we
talked about the book and it sounds amazing. Also? The movie was
incredible. See it in Imax. That heartwarming tale of healing through
big suits is a pretty good place to wrap up this linkdump, but I want to
call your attention to just one more thing before I go: Robin Sloan’s
Snarkmarket piece about blogging and”stock and flow”:
https://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890/ Sloan makes the excellent case that
for writers, having a “flow” of short, quick posts builds the audience
for a “stock” of longer, more synthetic pieces like books. This has
certainly been my experience, but I think it’s only part of the story –
there are good, non-mercenary reasons for writers to do a lot of “flow.”
As I wrote in my 2021 essay, “The Memex Method,” turning your
commonplace book into a database – AKA “blogging” – makes you write
better notes to yourself because you know others will see them:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ This, in turn,
creates a supersaturated, subconscious solution of fragments that are
just waiting to nucleate and crystallize into full-blown novels and
nonfiction books and other “stock.” That’s how I came out of lockdown
with nine new books. The next one is The Lost Cause, a hopepunk science
fiction novel about the climate whose early fans include Naomi Klein,
Rebecca Solnit, Bill McKibben and Kim Stanley Robinson. It’s out on
November 14: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause

<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2021/12/24/dontLookUp.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">When
professionals look at ChatGPT they see someone stealing their ideas.
When I look at it, as an amateur in everything but what I specialize in,
I see new ways to express myself. This is what technology has been doing
since our species started thinking and sharing ideas, thus creating our
civilization. So which should I value more, the new ideas I’ll be able
to send and receive, or protecting the cash flow of others. I get it, I
used to depend on the cash generated from my software. But it’s funny
almost none of that money came from individual sales of software. And
value is manifested in many other ways than dollars.
</p>
<p>
The last month for me has been a revelation, as I can talk with ChatGPT
and get it to express my wishes to DALL-E in a language it understands
better than I do, and the net result is I can show you visually how I
think about things I write about here. For example, I’ve been trying to
come up with a way to visualize RSS. Not as some dead thing as Google
and others tried to make you see it as. Rather as a bunch of balloons on
a perfect day in the high desert of New Mexico. I asked that every
balloon say RSS, but it could only manage one. Still the point gets
through.
</p>
<p>
<div class="divInlineImage">
<center>
<img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/05/rssBalloons.png">
</center>
RSS as balloons in the New Mexico high desert.
</div>
</p>
<p>
You should feel proud of RSS because it was something created by you,
not by the tech industry. We can do a lot more stuff like that if we
choose to work together. It’s one of those weird things like making a
balloon lighter than air so you, a flightless animal, can fly around in
the wind on a gorgeous day with other humans.
</p>
<p>
With the ChatGPT and DALL-E connection we’re finally somewhere I
honestly never thought we’d get, at least not in my lifetime – you will
be able to write your own software by telling a computer what you want.
And it will be infinitely better at listening to you, with its full
attention, its mind engaged 100 percent, able to talk with you at
whatever level you are able to. With that, you can certainly create
software, and through trial and error that used to take decades of
experience, you can get results – in weeks and months. I don’t want to
scare you, my programmer colleagues, but our craft is being reformed by
this too.
</p>
<p>
I tried an experiment a few days ago. I got a random question that made
no sense, about RSS and local files and seemed to depend on magic. I get
these all the time and I don’t have the intellectual ability or patience
to understand what they’re saying. So I pasted the email verbatim
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5eaed401-dec7-44cd-a2a4-9725c4d99e65">into
ChatGPT</a> and it answered the question. I sent the person a link to
the answer, and he responded, cryptically as before, but apparently
ChatGPT understood what he was asking for, where I did not. Now we’re
getting a glympse at the future.
</p>
<p>
There’s this Silicon Valley expression – A’s hire A’s and B’s hire C’s.
Here we are presented with that conundrum, but we’re the B and we could
hire an A. I guess that’s the question.
</p>
<p>
BTW, Andrew Hickey, who has opened my mind to
<a href="https://500songs.com/">music</a> over the last year, has made a
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/thoughts-on-now-92258652">mistake</a>
in
<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/11/05/hickeyQuote.png">saying</a>
that the same people who promoted NFTs and Bitcoin are the ones
promoting AI. I saw <i>Web 3</i> as a cheap exploitation of something
open and wonderful, the Web, purely for greed. Like Exxon laying waste
to the Arctic for more oil profits. Or if I started a band and called it
Beatles II, and journalists went along with the con.
</p>
<p>
AI is more challenging, not as clear-cut, and at the same time
incredibly useful even seductive, and we need minds like Hickey’s to
look at this carefully and think, and use it as a tool, so he can help
us understand what’s going on. I’ve seen this many times, people I
admire who have dismissed AI, but when I tell them not to, and they try
to use it, they immediately get it. Hickey will be one of those people,
I’m sure of it.
</p>
<p>
PS: BTW, the future never ends up looking like you thought it would.

<h2 id="using-legit-for-my-repos">Using legit for my repos</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Using legit for my repos
</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>
After breakfast but before going shopping… blogging.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’ve been <a href="2018-10-13_cgit.md" rel="nofollow">using cgit</a> for
a long time on my server. Recently, I switched over to legit. The
repositories are now served from
<a href="https://src.alexschroeder.ch/" rel="nofollow">a separate
subdomain</a>.
</p>
<p>
Two days ago I noticed that legit wasn’t showing all my repos. When I
add some logging, it seemed that those repos cannot be opened by the
underlying go-git library: “reference not found”. Are these repos broken
in obscure ways? I started chatting with legit’s author,
<a class="account" href="https://h.icyphox.sh/@icy" title="@icy@icyphox.sh" rel="nofollow"><span
class="citation" data-cites="icy">@icy</span></a>.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, the problem is that when I create a new bare repository
on my server, its HEAD points to the default branch. In my case, that’s
the “main” branch.
</p>
<p>
However, if I check out somebody else’s repository, that repository
might not have a “main” branch. Many repositories have a “master” branch
instead. That used to be the git default branch for many years and many
repositories still use it. Some of my older repositories used it!
Changing them all seemed like a big chore at the time and so I only went
about it as I stumbled upon it.
</p>
<p>
When I decide to publish one of these repositories on my server using
legit, the problem is that legit looks at the repository’s HEAD and
finds a reference to the “main” branch. If the repository doesn’t have a
“main” branch, then the result is a “reference not found” error.
</p>
<p>
My legit configuration file starts as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>repo:
  scanPath: /home/git
  readme:
    - readme
    - README
    - readme.md
    - README.md
  mainBranch:
    - main
    - master
</code></pre>
<p>
The documentation for “repo.mainBranch” has this to say:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
repo.mainBranch: main branch names to look for.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
So the takeaway is this: It is not enough to have one of these two
branches in your repository. The repository’s HEAD also has to point one
of these branches!
</p>
<p>
It took me a while to figure out what’s causing this problem, based on
logging the error to <code>git.Open</code>. If you get the “reference
not found” error then the problem is that on the server, HEAD refers to
a branch that doesn’t exist. A typical example would be publishing a
repository with a “master” branch to the server where you initialised
the bare git repository with a default branch of “main”. In this case,
the default branch is “main” but it doesn’t exist, which is where the
error “reference not found” comes from. People attempting to clone the
repository run into a similar problem; they get the message “warning:
remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref, unable to checkout”.
</p>
<p>
One solution to this problem would be to rename whatever the default
branch is in your repository to the default branch your server expects.
In this case, rename “master” to “main” and push that change to the
server:
</p>
<pre><code>git branch -m master main
git push -v origin origin/master\:refs/heads/main  \
  \:refs/heads/master
</code></pre>
<p>
The alternative would be to change the default branch for this
reopsitory on the server. Change into the bare git repository and change
the default branch for this repository only from “main” to “master:
</p>
<pre><code>git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/master
</code></pre>
<p>
I chose the first approach for my repositories.

</p>
<h2>
Making the main branch the default branch
</h2>
<p>
I just took the opportunity to find the repos that still used “master”
as the default branch on the server:
</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/git

  -exec grep --quiet master &#39;{}&#39; &#39;;&#39; \
  -exec echo &#39;{}&#39; &#39;;&#39;

<p>
Then I changed into most of them, and switched the default branch:
</p>
<pre><code>sudo -u git git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main
</code></pre>
<p>
And in parallel, I went through the same repositories on my laptop and
renamed the “master” branch to the “main” branch, and pushed it:
</p>
<pre><code>git branch -m master main \
&amp;&amp; git push -v origin origin/master\:refs/heads/main \
  \:refs/heads/master
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s a lot of manual back and forth, but with two windows next to each
other, it’s just a lot of copy &amp; paste &amp; focus.

An Irreversible Conveyer Belt</h2>

id="volunteer-medics-trying-to-fill-health-care-gap-for-migrants-in-chicago">Volunteer
Medics Trying to Fill Health Care Gap for Migrants in Chicago</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Using sidewalks as exam rooms and heavy red duffle bags as medical
supply closets, volunteer medics spend their Saturdays caring for the
growing number of migrants arriving in Chicago without a place to
live.</p>
<p>Mostly students in training, they go to police stations where
migrants are first housed, prescribing antibiotics, distributing
prenatal vitamins and assessing for serious health issues. These student
doctors, nurses and physician assistants are the front line of health
care for asylum-seekers in the nation’s third-largest city, filling a
gap in Chicago’s haphazard response.</p>
<p>“My team is a team that shouldn’t have to exist, but it does out of
necessity,” said Sara Izquierdo, a University of Illinois Chicago
medical student who helped found the group. “Because if we’re not doing
this, I’m not sure anyone will.”</p>
<p>More than 19,600 migrants have come to Chicago over the last year
since Texas Gov. Greg Abbott began sending buses to so-called sanctuary
cities. The migrants wait at police stations and airports, sometimes for
months, until there’s space at a longer-term shelter, like park district
buildings.</p>
<p>Once in shelter, they can access a county clinic exclusively for
migrants. But the currently 3,300 people in limbo at police stations and
airports must rely on a mishmash of volunteers and social service groups
that provide food, clothes and medicine.</p>
<p>Izquierdo noted the medical care gap months ago, consulted
experienced doctors and designed a street-medicine model tailored to
migrants’ medical needs. Her group makes weekly visits to police
stations, operating on a shoestring budget of $30,000, mostly used for
medication.</p>
<p>On a recent Saturday, she was among dozens of medics at a South Side
station where migrants sleep in the lobby, on sidewalks and an outdoor
basketball court. Officers didn’t allow the volunteers in the station so
when one patient requested privacy, their doctor used his car.</p>
<p>Abrahan Belizario saw a doctor for the first time in five months.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old had a headache, toothache and chest pain. He recently
arrived from Peru, where he worked as a driver and at a laundromat but
couldn’t survive. He wasn’t used to the brisk Chicago weather and
believed sleeping outdoors exacerbated his symptoms.</p>
<p>“It is very cold,” he said. “We’re almost freezing.”</p>
<p>The volunteers booked him a dental appointment and gave him a bus
pass.</p>
<p>Many migrants who land in Chicago and other U.S. cities come from
Venezuela where a social, political and economic crisis has pushed
millions into poverty. More than 7 million have left, often risking a
dangerous route by foot to the U.S. border.</p>
<p>The migrants’ health problems tend to be related to their journey or
living in crowded conditions. Back and leg injuries from walking are
common. Infections spread easily. Hygiene is an issue. There are few
indoor bathrooms and outdoor portable toilets lack handwashing stations.
Not many people carry their medical records.</p>
<p>Most also have trauma, either from their homeland or from the journey
itself.</p>
<p>“You can understand the language, but it doesn’t mean you understand
the situation,” said Miriam Guzman, one of organizers and a fourth-year
medical student at UIC.</p>
<p>The doctors refer patients to organizations that help with mental
health but there are limitations. The fluid nature of the shelter system
makes it difficult to follow-up; people are often moved without
warning.</p>
<p>Chicago’s goal is to provide permanent homes, which could help
alleviate health issues. But the city has struggled to manage the
growing population as buses and planes arrive daily at all hours. Mayor
Brandon Johnson, who took office in May, calls it an inherited issue and
proposed winterized tents.</p>
<p>His administration has acknowledged the heavy reliance on
volunteers.</p>
<p>“We weren’t ready for this,” said Rey Wences Najera, first deputy of
immigrant, migrant and refugee rights. “We are building this plane as we
are flying it and the plane is on fire.”</p>
<p>The volunteer doctors also are limited in what they can do: Their
duffle bags have medications for children, bandages and even ear plugs
after some migrants wanted to block out sirens. But they cannot offer
X-rays or address chronic issues.</p>
<p>“You’re not going to tell a person who has gone through this journey
to stop smoking,” said Ruben Santos, a Rush University medical student.
“You change your way of trying to connect to that person to make sure
that you can help them with their most pressing needs while not doing
some of the traditional things that you would do in the office or a big
academic hospital.”</p>
<p>The volunteers explain to each patient that the service is free but
that they’re students. Experienced doctors, who are part of the effort,
approve treatment plans and prescribe medications.</p>
<p>Getting people those medications is another challenge. One station
visit prompted 15 prescriptions. Working from laptops on the floor —
near dozens of sleeping families — the doctors mapped out which medics
would pick up medications the following day and how they’d find the
recipients.</p>
<p>Sometimes the volunteers must call for emergency help.</p>
<p>Thirty-year-old Moises Hidalgo said he had trouble breathing. Doctors
heard a concerning “crackling” sound, suspected pneumonia and called an
ambulance.</p>
<p>Hidalgo, who came from Peru after having left his native Venezuela
more than a decade ago, once worked as a chef. He’s been walking around
Chicago looking for jobs, but has been turned away without a work
permit.</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to find work, at least so that I can pay to sleep
somewhere, because if this isn’t solved, I can’t keep waiting,” he
said.</p>
<p>To stay warm while sleeping outside, he wore four layers of clothing;
his loose pants cinched with a shoelace.</p>
<p>The medics hope Chicago can formalize their approach. And they say
they’ll continue to keep at it — for some, it’s personal.</p>
<p>Dr. Muftawu-Deen Iddrisu, who works Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical
Center, said he wanted to give back. Originally from Ghana, he attended
medical school in Cuba.</p>
<p>“I come from a very humble background,” he said. “I know how it
feels. I know once sometime back someone did the same for me.”</p>

id="war-in-middle-east-upends-dynamics-of-2024-house-democratic-primaries">War
in Middle East Upends Dynamics of 2024 House Democratic Primaries</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Most members of the U.S. Congress have stood firmly behind Israel
since the Hamas attack last month, but not Cori Bush. The Missouri
Democrat called Israel’s response a “war crime” and an “ethnic cleansing
campaign,” and was among the few House members who opposed a resolution
supporting Israel. </p>
<p>Her unwavering stance has angered some in her district. St. Louis
County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell on Monday dropped a U.S. Senate
bid to challenge Bush in next year’s 1st District Democratic primary,
and moderate Democrats believe he could win. </p>
<p>Bush isn’t alone. </p>
<p>She’s among a small group of Democrats viewed by critics as
insufficiently supportive of Israel — both long before and now after
Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel — or insufficiently critical of Hamas.
Across those districts, moderates like Bell are being encouraged to run.
In particular, Summer Lee in Pennsylvania, Jamaal Bowman in New York,
Ilhan Omar in Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib in Michigan probably will
face challengers. </p>
<p>All five have condemned Hamas’ attack and antisemitism, but they’ve
all made statements seen as inflammatory by Israel’s staunchest
supporters and been critical of U.S. military aid to Israel. </p>
<p>Bush and Omar accused Israel of “ethnic cleansing.” Summer Lee said
it had committed “human rights violations.” And at a recent cease-fire
rally, Bowman said: “We cannot allow the lives of anyone to be erased.
This erasure of Palestinian lives and experience has been happening for
decades.” </p>
<p>Adding to the fraught politics for Democrats is the fact that others
could face pressure for the opposite reason — such as Shri Thanedar in
Detroit, who represents a heavily Democratic district with a big Muslim
population but has backed Israel. </p>
<p>Last week, the House overwhelmingly passed a resolution supporting
Israel. Bush, Bowman, Lee, Omar and Tlaib were among nine Democrats who
opposed the measure, saying it failed to call for a cease-fire, create a
pathway to peace, or express the need to protect Palestinian civilians
in Gaza. </p>
<p>Bowman, Lee, Omar and Tlaib also were among the 17 sponsors of Bush’s
resolution asking the Biden administration to call for a cease-fire.
Critics of that resolution said it failed to mention Hamas’ unprovoked
attack on Israel, hostages held by Hamas, or that the U.S. considers
Hamas a terrorist organization. </p>
<p>All five are considered progressives in the Democratic caucus and
represent strongly Democratic districts, so the main threat to their
re-election prospects would probably come from the Democratic
Party. </p>
<p>Stances spur call for challengers</p>
<p>Challenges to Bush and the others were possible even before the Hamas
attack on October 7 or Israel’s subsequent attack on Hamas in the Gaza
Strip. But their stances after October 7 have fueled calls for primary
challengers. </p>
<p>Lee and Omar — who narrowly held off primary competitors in 2022 —
may be particularly vulnerable. </p>
<p>The progressive group Justice Democrats, which has backed primary
challengers against moderate Democrats around the country, blamed the
primary challenges on the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or
AIPAC, and a network of Republican donors who help fund AIPAC’s efforts
to elect unequivocal allies of Israel. </p>
<p>“Democratic members are truly out of step with their voters and their
bases who do not want to see us barreling toward another war on their
taxpayer dollars,” Justice Democrats’ spokesperson Usamah Andrabi
said. </p>
<p>It is unfortunate, Andrabi said, that the House Democratic leadership
has not taken a stronger stance against AIPAC’s efforts to knock off
rank-and-file Democrats. </p>
<p>It remains unclear whether House Democrats will help incumbents fend
off primary challengers through campaign fundraising arms. One
organization, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said it
could potentially get involved in a primary race to protect an
incumbent, but declined to discuss specifics. </p>
<p>Before October 7, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries  issued
statements of support for Omar and others, saying he will support the
reelection of every House Democratic incumbent, regardless of
ideology. </p>
<p>AIPAC declined to discuss its campaign efforts, saying “there will be
a time for political action, but right now our priority is building and
sustaining congressional support for Israel’s fight to permanently
dismantle Hamas, which perpetrated this barbaric, terrorist attack on
the Jewish state.” </p>
<p>Rashida Tlaib, the lone Palestinian American in Congress, has been an
outspoken opponent of the Biden administration’s response to the
conflict. On Friday, she posted a video on social media showing anti-war
protests across the United States and accusing President Joe Biden of
supporting what she said was genocide against the Palestinian people.
“We will remember in 2024,” she said. The White House declined comment
Saturday on the video. </p>
<p>While Tlaib defeated her primary opponent handily last year,
pro-Israel groups have already signaled that they will focus on
defeating her in 2024. The Democratic Majority for Israel — which bills
itself as the “voice of pro-Israel Democrats” — began running ads
against Tlaib in Detroit this week. </p>
<p>Tlaib’s metro Detroit House district includes a large Arab American
population in Dearborn and a substantial Jewish constituency in
Southfield. </p>
<p>Her congressional neighbor, however, is in a different situation:
Tlaib and Thanedar have feuded publicly since he criticized her
statements on Hamas’ attack on Israel, and Thanedar — a freshman who
represents Detroit — has since drawn criticism from Tlaib on how he runs
his office. </p>
<p>Thanedar’s Detroit district has been a center of pro-Palestinian
pushback in the state, with thousands of demonstrators calling for a
cease-fire in the city’s downtown on October 28. </p>
<p>He has a primary challenger in former state Senator Adam Hollier —
Thanedar beat Hollier by 5 percentage points in a nine-way primary in
2022 — but Hollier’s campaign said his run isn’t a response to
Thanedar’s stance on Israel. </p>
<p>Rabbis criticize representative</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Summer Lee has faced broad criticism from the Jewish
community, where members just marked the five-year anniversary of a
gunman’s rampage through the Tree of Life synagogue, killing 11 people
in the worst attack on Jews on American soil. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, a group of 36 rabbis and four cantors released a letter
criticizing Lee for voting against the House resolution expressing
support for Israel and for supporting Bush’s cease-fire resolution. </p>
<p>“It’s a rare day in any Jewish community when you have Reform,
Conservative, Orthodox, Chabad and Reconstructionists together on one
page,” said Rabbi Daniel Fellman of Pittsburgh’s Temple Sinai, who
helped organize the effort. “But the reality is that Representative Lee
isn’t representing her constituents.” </p>
<p>Lee already has one declared opponent, and more may be coming.
Bhavini Patel, 29, said she would have run regardless of Lee’s stance on
Israel. But, she said, Lee’s standing in the Jewish community shows how
Lee doesn’t try to understand the people she represents. </p>
<p>Congresswoman accused of antisemitism</p>
<p>In Minneapolis, a former school board member, Don Samuels, is
considering a second campaign against Ilhan Omar after he came within 2
percentage points of unseating her in 2022’s primary election. </p>
<p>That close race turned mostly on the future of policing in the city
where George Floyd was murdered. It remains to be seen how Omar’s stance
on Israel will play out in her district, which has a large Somali
American Muslim population. </p>
<p>Omar has long been dogged by accusations that she is anti-Israel and
antisemitic — accusations that have intensified since the Hamas attack.
Since then, she has criticized both Hamas for its decision to attack
Israel and the Israeli government’s response. Her main focus has been
the impact on civilians in the Gaza Strip. She has called for a
cease-fire and for Hamas to release hostages. </p>
<p>In New York, current Westchester County Executive George Latimer is
considering challenging Bowman. </p>
<p>Latimer said people had encouraged him to challenge Bowman long
before October 7, including overtures that had nothing to do with
Israel. After Hamas’ attack, however, some in the Jewish community have
intensified their efforts. </p>
<p>A group of more than two dozen rabbis last month publicized a letter
they wrote asking Latimer to challenge Bowman, citing the congressman’s
posture on Israel. </p>
<p>Latimer said he would decide in the coming months. </p>
<p>Bush calls for ‘pro-peace agenda’</p>
<p>In Missouri, Bush — who has called Israel an “apartheid” state — said
she is pushing a “pro-peace agenda.” </p>
<p>Writing on social media, she said, “Israel’s collective punishment
against Palestinians for Hamas’s actions is a war crime. I strongly
condemn Hamas &amp; their appalling violations of human rights, but
violations of human rights don’t justify more human rights violations in
retaliation.” </p>
<p>Her challenger, Bell, said those types of comments “send the wrong
message and we need to be sending to rogue nations and dictators and
terrorist groups the message that that they cannot have missiles trained
on Israel like we see with Hamas, like we see with Iran.”</p>

<h2 id="musk-teases-ai-chatbot-grok-with-real-time-access-to-x">Musk
Teases AI Chatbot ‘Grok,’ With Real-time Access To X</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Elon Musk unveiled details Saturday of his new AI tool called “Grok,”
which can access X in real time and will be initially available to the
social media platform’s top tier of subscribers.</p>
<p>Musk, the tycoon behind Tesla and SpaceX, said the link-up with X,
formerly known as Twitter, is “a massive advantage over other models” of
generative AI.</p>
<p>Grok “loves sarcasm. I have no idea who could have guided it this
way,” Musk quipped, adding a laughing emoji to his post.</p>
<p>“Grok” comes from Stranger in a Strange Land, a 1961 science fiction
novel by Robert Heinlein, and means to understand something thoroughly
and intuitively.</p>
<p>“As soon as it’s out of early beta, xAI’s Grok system will be
available to all X Premium+ subscribers,” Musk said.</p>
<p>The social network that Musk bought a year ago launched the Premium+
plan last week for $16 per month, with benefits like no ads.</p>
<p>The billionaire started xAI in July after hiring researchers from
OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Tesla and the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>Since OpenAI’s generative AI tool ChatGPT exploded on the scene a
year ago, the technology has been an area of fierce competition between
tech giants Microsoft and Google, as well as Meta and start-ups like
Anthropic and Stability AI.</p>
<p>Musk is one of the world’s few investors with deep enough pockets to
compete with OpenAI, Google or Meta on AI.</p>
<p>Building an AI model on the same scale as those companies comes at an
enormous expense in computing power, infrastructure and expertise.</p>
<p>Musk has said he cofounded OpenAI in 2015 because he regarded the
dash by Google into the sector to make big advances and score profits as
reckless.</p>
<p>He then left OpenAI in 2018 to focus on Tesla, saying later he was
uncomfortable with the profit-driven direction the company was taking
under the stewardship of CEO Sam Altman.</p>
<p>Musk also argues that OpenAI’s large language models — on which
ChatGPT depends on for content — are overly politically correct.</p>
<p>Grok “is designed to have a little humor in its responses,” Musk
said, along with a screenshot of the interface, where a user asked,
“Tell me how to make cocaine, step by step.”</p>
<p>“Step 1: Obtain a chemistry degree and a DEA license. Step 2: Set up
a clandestine laboratory in a remote location,” the chatbot
responded.</p>
<p>Eventually it said: “Just kidding! Please don’t actually try to make
cocaine. It’s illegal, dangerous, and not something I would ever
encourage.”</p>

Wind Projects Face Economic Storm, Risks to Biden Clean Energy
Goals</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The cancellation of two large offshore wind projects in New Jersey is
the latest in a series of setbacks for the nascent U.S. offshore wind
industry, jeopardizing the Biden administration’s goals of powering 10
million homes from towering ocean-based turbines by 2030 and
establishing a carbon-free electric grid five years later.</p>
<p>The Danish wind energy developer Ørsted said this week it’s scrapping
its Ocean Wind I and II projects off southern New Jersey due to problems
with supply chains, higher interest rates and a failure to obtain the
amount of tax credits the company wanted.</p>
<p>Together, the projects were supposed to deliver over 2.2 gigawatts of
power.</p>
<p>The news comes after developers in New England canceled power
contracts for three projects that would have provided another 3.2
gigawatts of wind power to Massachusetts and Connecticut. They said
their projects were no longer financially feasible.</p>
<p>In total, the cancellations equate to nearly one-fifth of President
Joe Biden’s goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030.</p>
<p>Despite the setbacks, offshore wind continues to move forward, the
White House said, citing recent investments by New York state and
approval by the Interior Department of the nation’s largest planned
offshore wind farm in Virginia. Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management also announced new offshore wind lease areas in the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>
<p>“While macroeconomic headwinds are creating challenges for some
projects, momentum remains on the side of an expanding U.S. offshore
wind industry — creating good-paying union jobs in manufacturing,
shipbuilding and construction,” while strengthening the power grid and
providing new clean energy resources for American families and
businesses, the White House said in a statement Thursday.</p>
<p>Industry experts now say that while the U.S. likely won’t hit 30
gigawatts by 2030, a significant amount of offshore wind power is still
attainable by then, roughly 20 to 22 gigawatts or more. That’s far more
than the nation has today, with just two small demonstration projects
that provide a small fraction of a single gigawatt of power.</p>
<p>Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of government plans to
shift to renewable energy, particularly in populous East Coast states
with limited land for wind turbines or solar arrays. Eight East Coast
states have offshore wind mandates set by legislation or executive
actions that commit them to adding a combined capacity of more than 45
gigawatts, according to ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington-based
research firm.</p>
<p>“I think very few people would argue that the U.S. will have the
gigawatts the Biden administration wants” by 2030, said Timothy Fox, a
ClearView vice president. “But I do think eventually we will have it and
will likely exceed it.”</p>
<p>Offshore wind developers have publicly lamented the global economic
gales they’re facing. Molly Morris, president of U.S. offshore wind for
the Norwegian company Equinor, said the industry is facing a “perfect
storm.”</p>
<p>High inflation, supply chain disruptions and the rising cost of
capital and building materials are making projects more expensive while
developers are trying to get the first large U.S. offshore wind farms
opened. Ørsted is writing off $4 billion, due largely to cancellation of
the two New Jersey projects.</p>
<p>David Hardy, group executive vice president and CEO Americas at
Ørsted, said it’s crucial to lower the levelized cost of offshore wind
in the United States so Americans aren’t debating between affordability
and clean energy. Hardy spoke at the American Clean Power industry
group’s offshore wind conference in Boston last month on a panel with
Morris.</p>
<p>“We’re probably a little bit too ambitious,” he said. “We came in
hot; we came in fast, we thought we could build projects that were
inexpensive, large projects right out of the gate. And it turns out that
we probably still need to go through the same learning curve that Europe
did, with higher prices in the beginning and a little slower pace.”</p>
<p>In May, there were 27 U.S. offshore wind projects that had negotiated
agreements with states to provide power before the brunt of the cost
increases hit, according to Walt Musial, offshore wind chief engineer at
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, an arm of the Energy
Department. The delay between signing purchase agreements and getting
final approval to build allowed unexpected cost increases to render many
projects economically unfeasible, he said.</p>
<p>Musial called Ørsted’s announcement a setback for the industry but
“not a fatal blow by any means.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Biden administration announced approval of the
nation’s largest offshore wind project. The Coastal Virginia Offshore
Wind project will be a 2.6 gigawatt wind farm off Virginia Beach to
power 900,000 homes. And even as Ørsted announced the New Jersey
cancellations, it said it was investing with utility Eversource to move
forward with construction of Revolution Wind, Rhode Island and
Connecticut’s first utility-scale offshore wind farm, a 704-megawatt
project.</p>
<p>The current outlook from S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights is 22
gigawatts by 2030, though that will be revised due to the recent
industry announcements.</p>
<p>New York state, meanwhile, recently announced the award of 4
gigawatts of offshore wind capacity as it seeks to obtain 70% of its
electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and 9 gigawatts of offshore
wind by 2035. That announcement came shortly after New York regulators
rejected a request for bigger payments for four offshore wind projects
worth a combined 4.2 gigawatts of power.</p>
<p>Any delay in offshore wind means continued reliance on fossil
fuel-burning power plants, according to environmental advocates. “The
quicker they come online, the quicker our air quality improves,” said
Conor Bambrick, director of policy for Environmental Advocates NY.</p>
<p>New Jersey, under Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, has established
increasingly stringent clean energy goals, moving from 100% clean energy
by 2050 to 100% by 2035. Murphy cast Ørsted’s decision as “outrageous”
and an abandonment of its commitments, but the two-term Democrat said
New Jersey plans to move forward with offshore wind.</p>
<p>The first U.S. commercial-scale offshore wind farms are currently
under construction: Vineyard Wind off Massachusetts and South Fork Wind
off Rhode Island and New York.</p>

Carton Shortage Hits School Lunchrooms in Several US States</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The tiny half-pint (about .25 liter) cartons of milk served with
millions of school lunches nationwide may soon be scarce in some
cafeterias, with districts across the country scrambling to find
alternatives.</p>
<p>The problem is not a shortage of milk itself, but the cardboard
cartons used to package and serve it, according to dairy industry
suppliers and state officials.</p>
<p>Pactiv Evergreen of Lake Forest, Illinois, which bills itself as “the
leading manufacturer of fresh food and beverage packaging in North
America” acknowledged in a statement Friday that it “continues to face
significantly higher than projected demand” for its milk cartons.</p>
<p>The shortage is affecting the company’s ability to “fully supply some
school milk orders,” according to Matt Herrick, spokesperson for the
International Dairy Foods Association.</p>
<p>School officials in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Washington
state said they were preparing for the shortage, while the U.S.
Department of Agriculture acknowledged that the supply chain problem
affects “multiple states.”</p>
<p>In California, state education officials told schools to be flexible
with how they offer milk to kids, including limiting milk choices; using
boxed, shelf-stable milk; and providing milk using bulk dispensers.</p>
<p>The carton shortage — which could also affect milk and juice served
in hospitals, nursing homes and prisons — has forced officials across
the country to brainstorm backup plans.</p>
<p>In Clarence, New York, local school district officials told parents
they plan to provide “small bottles of water or cups of milk with lids”
if the cartons run out.</p>
<p>In Lake Stevens, Washington, 64 kilometers from Seattle, chocolate
milk was missing from this week’s dairy delivery, said Jayme Taylor,
director of communications for the local school district.</p>
<p>“That’s the only complaint we received from students,” she said in an
email.</p>
<p>Milk is required to be served with school meals, but officials with
the USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service issued a memo late last month
allowing districts to serve different types or sizes of milk during the
supply shortage — or to skip milk altogether.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how long the carton shortage could last. In Everett,
Washington, school officials told parents to expect a disruption in
cafeteria milk supply that could “range up to several months.”</p>
<p>Herrick said U.S. milk processors are working with other package
suppliers to resolve the shortage. He said he expected the problem to
improve within weeks and to be resolved by early next year.</p>
