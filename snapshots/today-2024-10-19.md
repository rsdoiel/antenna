## Chromium’s influence on Chromium alternatives

date: 2024-10-19, from: OS News

I don’t think most people realize how Firefox and Safari depend on Google for more than “just” revenue from default search engine deals and prototyping new web platform features. Off the top of my head, Safari and Firefox use the following Chromium libraries: libwebrtc, libbrotli, libvpx, libwebp, some color management libraries, libjxl (Chromium may eventually contribute a Rust JPEG-XL implementation to Firefox; it’s a hard image format to implement!), much of Safari’s cryptography (from BoringSSL), Firefox’s 2D renderer (Skia)…the list goes on. Much of Firefox’s security overhaul in recent years (process isolation, site isolation, user namespace sandboxes, effort on building with ControlFlowIntegrity) is directly inspired by Chromium’s architecture. ↫ Rohan “Seirdy” Kumar Definitely an interesting angle on the browser debate I hadn&#8217;t really stopped to think about before. The argument is that while Chromium&#8217;s dominance is not exactly great, the other side of the coin is that non-Chromium browsers also make use of a lot of Chromium code all of us benefit from, and without Google doing that work, Mozilla would have to do it by themselves, and let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re in a great position to do so. I&#8217;m not saying I buy the argument, but it&#8217;s an argument nonetheless. I honestly wouldn&#8217;t mind a slower development pace for the web, since I feel a lot of energy and development goes into things making the web worse, not better. Redirecting some of that development into things users of the web would benefit from seems like a win to me, and with the dominant web engine Chromium being run by an advertising company, we all know where their focus lies, and it ain&#8217;t on us as users. I&#8217;m still firmly on the side of less Chromium, please.

## Google’s ad-blocking crackdown underway

date: 2024-10-18, from: OS News

Google has gotten a bad reputation as of late for being a bit overzealous when it comes to fighting ad blockers. Most recently, it’s been spotted automatically turning off popular ad blocking extension uBlock Origin for some Google Chrome users. To a degree, that makes sense—Google makes its money off ads. But with malicious ads and data trackers all over the internet these days, users have legitimate reasons to want to block them. The uBlock Origin controversy is just one facet of a debate that goes back years, and it’s not isolated: your favorite ad blocker will likely be affected next. Here are the best ways to keep blocking ads now that Google is cracking down on ad blockers. ↫ Michelle Ehrhardt at LifeHacker Here&#8217;s the cold and harsh reality: ad blocking will become ever more difficult as time goes on. Not only is Google obviously fighting it, other browser makers will most likely follow suit. Microsoft is an advertising company, so Edge will follow suit in dropping Manifest v2 support. Apple is an advertising company, and will do whatever they can to make at least their own ads appear. Mozilla is an advertising company, too, now, and will continue to erode their users&#8217; trust in favour of nebulous nonsense like privacy-respecting advertising in cooperation with Facebook. The best way to block ads is to move to blocking at the network level. Get a cheap computer or Raspberry Pi, set up Pi-Hole, and enjoy some of the best adblocking you&#8217;re ever going to get. It&#8217;s definitely more involved than just installing a browser extension, but it also happens to be much harder for advertising companies to combat. If you&#8217;re feeling generous, set up Pi-Holes for your parents, friends, and relatives. It&#8217;s worth it to make their browsing experience faster, safer, and more pleasant. And once again I&#8217;d like to reiterate that I have zero issues with anyone blocking the ads on OSNews. Your computer, your rules. It&#8217;s not like display ads are particularly profitable anyway, so I&#8217;d much rather you support us through Patreon or a one-time donation through Ko-Fi, which is a more direct way of ensuring OSNews continues to exist. Also note that the OSNews Matrix room &#8211; think IRC, but more modern, and fully end-to-end encrypted &#8211; is now up and running and accessible to all OSNews Patreons as well.

## Qualcomm cancels its mini PC with the Snapdragon X Elite processor

date: 2024-10-18, from: OS News

Something odd happened to Qualcomm&#8217;s Snapdragon Dev Kit, an $899 mini PC powered by Windows 11 and the company&#8217;s latest Snapdragon X Elite processor. Qualcomm decided to abruptly discontinue the product, refund all orders (including for those with units on hand), and cease its support, claiming the device &#8220;has not met our usual standards of excellence.&#8221; ↫ Taras Buria at Neowin The launch of the Snapdragon X Pro and Elite chips seems to have mostly progressed well, but there have been a few hiccups for those of us who want ARM but aren&#8217;t interested in Windows and/or laptops. There&#8217;s this story, which is just odd all around, with an announced, sold, and even shipped product suddenly taken off the market, which I think at this point was the only non-laptop device with an X Elite or Pro chip. If you are interested in developing for Qualcomm&#8217;s new platform, but don&#8217;t want a laptop, you&#8217;re out of luck for now. Another note is that the SoC SKU in the Dev Kit was clocked a tiny bit higher than the laptop SKUs, which perhaps plays a role in its cancellation. The bigger hiccup is the problematic Linux bring-up, which is posing many more problems and is taking a lot longer than Qualcomm very publicly promised it would take. For now, if you want to run Linux on a Snapdragon X Elite or Pro device, you&#8217;re going to need a custom version of your distribution of choice, tailored to a specific laptop model, using a custom kernel. It&#8217;s an absolute mess and basically means that at this point in time, months and months after release, buying one of these to run Linux on them is a bad idea. Quite a few important bits will arrive with Linux 6.12 to supposedly greatly improve the experience, but seeing is believing. Qualcomm made a lot of grandiose promises about Linux support, and they simply haven&#8217;t delivered.

## Playing with PyGame Zero

date: 2024-10-18, from: Stephen Smith's blog

Introduction I recently read the two books: “Code the Classics” Volumes I and II from Raspberry Pi Press. These books examine the history of several classic video games such as Centipede and Double Dragon and then provide a Python implementation of a similar game. I found the history of all these various video games fascinating [&#8230;]

## Go Plan9 memo, speeding up calculations 450%

date: 2024-10-18, from: OS News

I want to take advantage of Go’s concurrency and parallelism for some of my upcoming projects, allowing for some serious number crunching capabilities. But what if I wanted EVEN MORE POWER?!? Enter SIMD, Same Instruction Muliple Data . Simd instructions allow for parallel number crunching capabilities right down at the hardware level. Many programming languages either have compiler optimizations that use simd or libraries that offer simd support. However, (as far as I can tell) Go’s compiler does not utilizes simd, and I cound not find a general propose simd package that I liked. I just want a package that offers a thin abstraction layer over arithmetic and bitwise simd operations. So like any good programmer I decided to slightly reinvent the wheel and write my very own simd package. How hard could it be? After doing some preliminary research I discovered that Go uses its own internal assembly language called Plan9. I consider it more of an assembly format than its own language. Plan9 uses target platforms instructions and registers with slight modifications to their names and usage. This means that x86 Plan9 is different then say arm Plan9. Overall, pretty weird stuff. I am not sure why the Go team went down this route. Maybe it simplifies the compiler by having this bespoke assembly format? ↫ Jacob Ray Pehringer Another case of light reading for the weekend. Even as a non-programmer I learned some interesting things from this one, and it created some appreciation for Go, even if I don&#8217;t fully grasp things like this. On top of that, at least a few of you will think this has to do with Plan9 the operating system, which I find a mildly entertaining ruse to subject you to.
