Apparently Substack&#39;s RSS feeds are a disaster, according to Manton Reece, who I trust on things like this. I&#39;ll have to take a look.

The Big Interview with Dan Rather podcast is gold. Just listened to his interview with Steven Van Zandt of the E Street Band and the Sopranos. There are nine seasons of this podcast between 2013 and 2021. Going to keep me busy for a while. The RSS feed works.

## OpenWrt One router is now available for $89

date: 2024-12-01, from: Liliputing

<p>OpenWrt is a free and open source, Linux-based operating system designed for routers and other networking applications. While it&#8217;s most often used as an aftermarket replacement for the firmware that comes pre-installed on a router, earlier this year the OpenWrt team announced it was partnering with Banana Pi to design and sell the first router [&#8230;]</p>

## Me and Skiing

date: 2024-12-01, from: Chris Coyier blog

I don&#8217;t seem like I&#8217;d be much of a skiier, do I? (I do not.) But here I am, doing skiing. It&#8217;s very (very) popular in Bend, Oregon because of the proximity to Mt. Bachelor (and to a lesser degree Hoodoo) and the outdoor lifestyle vibes here. People you know will be downhill skiing in [&#8230;]

## Wisdom of the crowds, or lowest common denominator?

date: 2024-12-01, from: Status-Q blog

I liked this: People have too inflated sense of what it means to &#8220;ask an AI&#8221; about something. The AI are language models trained basically by imitation on data from human labelers. Instead of the mysticism of &#8220;asking an AI&#8221;, think of it more as &#8220;asking the average data labeler&#8221; on the internet. &#8230; But <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/12/01/12284/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>
