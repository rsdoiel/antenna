NATO Troops Participate in Biggest Exercise Since Cold War</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>London — NATO began its biggest military exercises since the Cold War
this week, with tens of thousands of troops set to move across Europe in
a show of force meant as a warning to Russia, following its full-scale
invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Operation Steadfast Defender 24 will see some 90,000 NATO military
personnel take part in a range of drills across Europe in coming months.
Fifty naval vessels, 80 aircraft and over 1,000 combat vehicles are
involved.</p>
<p>The exercises “will show that NATO can conduct and sustain complex
multi-domain operations over several months, across thousands of
kilometers, from the high north to central and eastern Europe, and in
any condition,” the 31-nation alliance said.</p>
<p>Logistics</p>
<p>“We do all of this to show we have the readiness, preparedness and
the forces in place to remove any room for miscalculation or
misunderstanding in Moscow about our readiness to protect every inch of
NATO territory. And as long as we do that there will be no attack
against NATO territory,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told
reporters in Brussels Tuesday.</p>
<p>The logistical challenge of moving soldiers and equipment is a vital
part of the exercise, said Liana Fix, fellow for Europe at the Council
on Foreign Relations in Washington.</p>
<p>“How do they get there? And how do they get there quick? Because the
war in Ukraine has shown that being too slow means that a part of your
territory can be occupied and has to be re-conquered, rather than
defending that territory the moment the attack happens,” Fix told
VOA.</p>
<p>Sweden, which hopes to join NATO in coming months, will also take
part in the operation, the biggest NATO drill since the Reforger
exercises of the 1980s. Hungary is the only NATO member yet to ratify
Sweden’s application.</p>
<p>Ukraine</p>
<p>The exercises come ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia’s
invasion of Ukraine, on February 24. The conflict has descended into a
war of attrition, with neither side seemingly able to make significant
territorial gains.</p>
<p>While NATO flexes its muscles in Europe, Kyiv is running low on
ammunition, as military aid packages in both the United States and the
European Union remain blocked by political infighting.</p>
<p>“The narrative from Ukraine is that Ukraine is defending NATO. And
that is a valid narrative if one follows the logic that Ukraine is
actually diminishing Russia’s army, has diminished Russia’s army, and
has diminished the military threat that Russia poses to the NATO
alliance. So from Ukraine’s perspective, it must be a lonely moment to
watch this NATO exercise,” analyst Liana Fix told VOA.</p>
<p>Artillery</p>
<p>NATO this week signed a $1.2 billion contract to buy some 220,000
rounds of artillery ammunition. The alliance says it will pass on the
shells to Ukraine, which has complained of ammunition shortages, or to
member states that want to replenish stockpiles that have been depleted
through supplying Ukrainian forces.</p>
<p>“This is important to defend our own territory, to build up our own
stocks, but also to continue to support Ukraine,” said NATO chief
Stoltenberg.</p>
<p>“We will support Ukraine with the systems and the weapons and
ammunitions they need to prevail as a sovereign independent country,
because we cannot allow (Russian) President (Vladimir) Putin to win in
Ukraine. That would be a tragedy for the Ukrainians and dangerous for
all of us,” he added.</p>

id="swedish-national-security-adviser-reflects-on-challenges-facing-europe">Swedish
National Security Adviser Reflects on Challenges Facing Europe</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Sweden, which dropped its position of military
nonalignment and sought NATO membership in the wake of Russia’s 2022
invasion of Ukraine, is now one vote away from joining the alliance as
its 32nd member.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Henrik Landerholm, Sweden’s national security adviser,
met with VOA in Washington to discuss his country’s imminent membership
and his perspectives on security challenges facing the alliance in
2024.</p>
<p>In Landerholm’s view, if Russia prevails in its war against Ukraine,
its appetite will only increase, resulting in greater security threats
for a much wider region.</p>
<p>Landerholm said he was grateful for America’s strong support for
Swedish NATO membership and is pleased the process now seems to be
coming to a close. Hungary is the sole remaining NATO ally yet to ratify
Swedish membership, and its National Assembly has indicated it intends
to vote soon.</p>
<p>According to Landerholm, there is nothing left to negotiate; it is
just a matter of waiting for Hungary’s ratification.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.</p>
<p>VOA: The Turkish parliament voted yesterday to approve Sweden’s NATO
membership. How does it feel and what does this mean for Sweden?</p>
<p>Henrik Landerholm, Swedish national security adviser: It definitely
feels good. It’s a confirmation that we have been on the right path and
that Turkey is fulfilling its obligations — what they promised in the
agreement between President [Recep Tayyip] Erdogan and Prime Minister
[Ulf] Kristersson in Vilnius [Lithuania] last year. We haven’t doubted
that this would happen, but of course it’s a good day when it
happens.</p>
<p>VOA: And now the next step is for the president to sign the decision.
Do you anticipate any complications?</p>
<p>Landerholm: We don’t anticipate [complications] other than that it’s
a formality. It has to be published in the official Gazette, and then
President Erdogan has to [deposit] the instruments in the State
Department, as is stated in the Washington Treaty. Then, of course, the
next step is Hungarian ratification. We will see what will happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOA: Prime Minister [Viktor] Orban said he is inviting Prime Minister
Kristersson to Budapest to negotiate. Do we know what he wants to
negotiate?</p>
<p>Landerholm: Well, to quote my foreign minister, there is not much to
negotiate. In the very kind and open letter he sent to my prime
minister, [Orban] suggests a visit to Budapest, and I foresee that this
will happen sooner or later. We should remember that Hungary invited
Sweden [to join] NATO without any preconditions, which is a very
different situation [from] Turkey, which had security concerns linked
mainly to Swedish and Finnish approaches toward terrorism. We’ve been
working with … Turkish authorities on that for about a year. With
Hungary, I believe it’s more of a general need to have a dialogue. We
are open to such a dialogue but have noticed no preconditions or need
for negotiation.</p>
<p>VOA: The U.S. has been very supportive of Sweden throughout this
process. How was the news received here?</p>
<p>Landerholm: Very positive — even relief — from the U.S. side. Sweden
has had strong support from the U.S. from the beginning. Sweden and
Finland are more welcomed as NATO members than we ever perceived before.
Speaking for Sweden, our understanding was that when Russia … showed
itself to be a predator without limits with a full-scale invasion of
Ukraine, we needed to safeguard our own security. The general feeling
was that we were on the demanding side, needing support from NATO.</p>
<p>[But the U.S.] was very clear that we were not only welcome due to
the general Open Door policy, but that we would create an important
addition to NATO. Over the last year, we have understood that our
contributions are appreciated. We have assets that are pretty unique in
the Baltics. We have military assets that few others have. Our force may
not be overwhelming in size, but in quality it is second to few. We have
an impressive defense industry. We have space assets, and our territory
is of utmost importance for the defense of Finland and the Baltic
States.</p>
<p>VOA: There was a perception about Turkey’s position on Swedish NATO
membership that it was never about Sweden or the PKK [Kurdistan Workers’
Party, considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and
European Union] but about F-16s. Turkey wanted the U.S. to agree on the
sale of F-16s in exchange for its consent to admit Sweden as a NATO
member. What can you share with us about this debate?</p>
<p>Landerholm: We have not been involved in any of the discussions in
that regard. From our perspective, we’ve done our homework in relation
to Turkey. We made an agreement with Turkey in Vilnius, and since then
we have just waited. They have put no extra demands on us. We take
Turkish security concerns seriously. We now have good cooperation
between Swedish and Turkish police, intelligence, and security services,
which fulfills the expectations that Turkey has had to a large extent
about PKK.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>VOA: What does Swedish and Finnish membership in NATO change for
Russia?</p>
<p>Landerholm: Well, if you listen to Russian interlocutors in general
and President [Vladimir] Putin in particular, it doesn’t change much. I
think that’s something Putin has to say, because otherwise it would be
obvious to the Russian population that the invasion of Ukraine was a
miscalculation.</p>
<p>In the long term, perhaps not in my lifetime, I’m hopeful that Russia
will develop in a democratic direction. We had high hopes during the
[1990s]. Those are now shattered.  We cannot trust Russian goodwill
anymore, and we need to seek our security in a wider context together
with others.</p>
<p>If Russia would be successful in Ukraine, its appetite would increase
further. We need to be cautious. We need to prepare. We need to rearm to
prepare for, perhaps unlikely, but fully possible events. That has been
the actual discussion in Sweden over the last few weeks.</p>
<p>VOA: More than 90% of Swedes support Ukraine in this war. What is
your government doing to continue this support and now, with NATO
membership, what is Sweden’s position on Ukraine as it comes to
enlargement?</p>
<p>Landerholm: The issue of Ukraine’s NATO membership has not been an
issue for us thus far, as we are not NATO members. I would not
anticipate what our position would be. Ukraine eventually has a natural
place in Euro-Atlantic security structures. So, it’s not an issue about
if, but rather about when and how.</p>
<p>VOA: Would it be more on the faster track side, or would it be more
like the French position that says that it will take decades?</p>
<p>Landerholm: We haven’t, as I said, taken any final decision in that
regard. But we are strong supporters of Ukraine. Sweden has militarily
supported Ukraine very strongly. We spent 3 billion euros over the past
two years, and the majority of this in military support. If Ukraine
loses the current war against Russia, it would be devastating not only
for Europe in general, but also for Sweden and our adjacent area. That
would give Russia an increased appetite of meddling in our affairs and
trying to divide and rule among EU as well as NATO countries. Weakness
is an invitation to Russia in this regard.</p>

In 2023, $23 billion in federal contracts went to companies run by
tribal nations, Alaska Native corporations and Native Hawaiian
organizations. That’s 3% of the total federal contracting pool. We’ll
get into why that money — and jobs that come with it — matter. Plus, the
indie film market at Sundance and a ten-year high for IBM stock.

<p>
For most of history, communicating with a computer has not been like
communicating with a person. In their earliest years, computers required
carefully constructed instructions, delivered through punch cards; then
came a command-line interface, followed by menus and options and text
boxes. If you wanted results, you needed to learn the computer’s
language.
</p>
<p>
This is beginning to change. Large language models—the technology
undergirding modern chatbots—allow users to interact with computers
through natural conversation, an innovation that introduces some baggage
from human-to-human exchanges. Early on in our respective explorations
of ChatGPT, the two of us found ourselves typing a word that we’d never
said to a computer before: “Please.” The syntax of civility has crept
into nearly every aspect of our encounters; we speak to this algebraic
assemblage as if it were a person—even when we know that …

<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce
yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My name is Ran Prieur. I’ve lived most of my life in Washington state. I
did well in school, and I was expected to be a computer engineer. But
looking back, the kids who went on to do that, were actually excited
about computers. For me, it was just one more tedious academic subject.
In college, after cruising through the “weed-out” courses, I couldn’t
bring myself to take an actual engineering course, and switched to the
humanities, which were somewhat interesting. I ended up getting two BAs,
in English and Philosophy.
</p>
<p>
I was born to be retired. Most people are always trying to fill time,
and I’m always trying to empty it. I had enough self-discipline to grind
through the academic system, but any full time job exhausts me, and I
spent the 90s working part time office jobs and living super-frugally. I
would have probably become high-end homeless, but I did some
housesitting for my family, and had some luck with money, and now I’m
retired on less than they say you need to retire.
</p>
<p>
For some reason, it’s easy for me to keep blogging, and I’ve been doing
it for almost 20 years. More recently I’ve been writing fiction, which
is harder than blogging but more rewarding. I practice improvisational
piano, where my style is to see how much I can squeeze out of one chord.
And when I have a lot of time, I play solo games of my favorite board
game, Spirit Island, and I’ve designed some custom spirits that I
haven’t released yet.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
In the 90s I made zines: hand-written, photocopied, and mailed. When the
internet came along, it was a much more efficient way to get words to an
audience. Two other zine people started a website called Unknown News,
and I started writing a column there every few weeks. After maybe a
year, around 2003, I bought my own domain name and posted my stuff
there.
</p>
<p>
I named the blog after myself, because whatever I end up writing about,
the name is still accurate. I started out writing essays about
contemporary politics and the critique of civilization, and now I write
short posts about different things, lately psychology, metaphysics,
societal collapse, and little personal tidbits. The main reason I
shifted to a shorter form, is that I learned to say things in fewer
words, in five paragraphs instead of five pages.
</p>
<p>
The most famous thing I’ve written, by far, is a 2004 essay called How
To Drop Out. I haven’t read it in more than ten years, because I’m sure
I’ll find all kinds of cringey stuff. But it continues to bring people
to my website.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to
blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Elvis Costello said, people think being a songwriter is cool, but really
it means walking around all day humming to yourself like a loony. That’s
basically my process. I have an idea, and I run the words through my
head, often muttering them in a whisper, until I’m ready to write them
down. That could take anywhere from ten minutes to a week. Sometimes I
do it in the middle of the night when I can’t sleep, and by morning I
have a whole post laid out in my head. But when I go to type it in,
there are always complications and changes.
</p>
<p>
For minor posts, I do the writing straight to the file manager. For
major posts, I type them into Notepad++, and I usually keep massaging
the words for a few days before posting them. I have a large text file
full of posts that are half finished or not good enough. Nobody reads my
stuff before I post it, but I often get reader feedback that sends me
off on tangents to new posts.
</p>
<p>
Asking a writer where ideas come from, is like asking a sailor where the
wind comes from. If your sails are working, the wind is just there. So
in terms of the work I put into writing, getting ideas is zero percent.
Ten percent is figuring out how to word it. And ninety percent is
figuring out how to <em>order</em> it. Even non-fiction has to be
written like a story, where one idea flows into the next.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe
the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I haven’t noticed any differences between physical spaces. It’s all
about mental space, and all I need is a block of time with no other
demands on my attention, which is hard to get in this world. I often
fantasize about being in solitary confinement, except with good food. I
would have loved to be a medieval monk, doing a couple hours a day of
simple useful tasks, and then going to my tiny room to contemplate the
divine.
</p>
<p>
When I’m writing fiction or playing music, cannabis does wonders for my
creativity. But when I write blog posts high, they turn out to be
second-rate. I suppose weed improves my intuition but not my rational
thinking.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your
tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My original web host was DR2, a tiny company that later got bought by
Mesopia, which got bought by Netbunch, which suspiciously lost my site
and all backups around 2006. I recovered it from my own old backups and
the web archive, and switched to a Hong Kong company called ICDsoft,
where I’ve been ever since for both domain registration and hosting.
</p>
<p>
From the beginning, I’ve used simple hand-coded html and css. It took me
a few weeks to build the site, and now it’s just a matter of copying and
pasting text and a few tags. I like to have my hands right on the actual
stuff, and I’m trying to hold onto the golden age of web 1.0, when a
non-programmer could get under the hood, and when sites had to be
compact for fast loading. I try to keep my home page under 40kB, and I
don’t run any scripts, except one that a reader contributed to do an
automatic archive, because I only archive about half my stuff.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would
you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
In terms of technical choices, I wouldn’t do anything differently. What
I regret about my early writing, is that it was too exciting and
inspirational, and also too negative. I was trying to slay dragons, and
it felt good and got me readers, but at some point the overall vibe of
reader feedback led me to dial it down, and I remain fame-phobic. Fame
is when people who don’t know you, build an image of you in their head
for their own purposes, and if you behave differently from that image,
they get mad at you.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how
much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it
generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising
personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The site costs me less than $100 a year. In the early years I had a link
where people could donate, but now I don’t take any money.
</p>
<p>
It’s a tragedy of the modern world that we need money to not die on the
streets. I’m lucky that I don’t need to monetize my blog, because it’s
difficult to not start making decisions about what you write, based on
where the money is coming from.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth
checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing
next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My favorite obscure blog is a newsletter called
<a href="https://thewhippet.org" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">The
Whippet</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another good one is
<a href="https://skunkledger.substack.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Skunk
Ledger</a>
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with
us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
My latest philosophical interest is acausal metaphysics. I learned about
it from a brilliant 1982 book called Physics as Metaphor, and there’s an
important 2003 paper called Causation as Folk Science. Physics is
causal: For two things to have a legitimate connection, there has to be
some chain of influence through matter directly influencing other matter
– although physics has a hint of acausality with quantum entanglement.
</p>
<p>
An example of acausality at work is astrology. In physics, there’s no
realistic way that remote planets can influence your life. But in
acausal metaphysics, the positions of the planets, and events in your
life, might be two different aspects of something deeper that we don’t
understand yet, so they can line up without any causality. This was what
Jung was trying to get at with synchronicity, and I try to cultivate
synchronicity in everyday life, by noticing and being grateful when
little things line up.

<h2 id="what-is-winter-anymore">What Is Winter Anymore?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
If you’ve had the uneasy sense that winter weather isn’t what it used to
be, you’re not alone — and you’re probably right. The everyday effects
of climate change on the year’s coldest months are quickly becoming too
blatant to dismiss.
</p>
<p>
As annual heat records continue to topple year after year — 2023, now
officially the hottest year on record, came
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/every-single-day-of-2023-was-extraordinarily-hot" target="_self">terrifyingly
close</a> to averaging 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial
temperatures — winter weather is responding. In some places, it’s
turning snowy days into rainy ones. In others, it’s turning cold days
bitterly so.
</p>
<p>
So — what, exactly, is going on? Let’s start with the basics.
</p>
<h2>
What does climate change have to do with winter?
</h2>
<p>
The main thing is that climate change is pushing winter temperatures
higher. In fact, the average winter temperature is rising faster than
that of any other season. Average temperatures in the lower 48 U.S.
states from December through February rose by almost 3 degrees
Fahrenheit between 1896 and 2021, compared to 2 degrees in spring and
1.5 degrees in summer and fall,
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-seasonal-temperature" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">federal
data show</a>.
</p>
<p>
The number of days below freezing each year is also on the decline
across the country and across the planet. A decade ago, the U.S. was
already seeing two weeks less snow cover, on average, than it did in
1972,
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-snow-cover" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to federal data</a>. And parts of the country, including cities in the
Northeast and Northwest, are on track to lose
<a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/12/20/18136006/climate-change-warmer-winters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over
a month</a> of freezing days by midcentury.
</p>
<p>
But in many places, daily highs and lows aren’t shifting at the same
rate. Winter nights, for instance, are
<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/us-trends/tmin/win" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">warming
even faster</a> than winter days — the total number of freezing nights
has been dropping in the U.S.
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/fewer-frigid-nights-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">since
the 1970s</a>. Colder places are also warming more quickly, with the
northern U.S. and especially the Northeast experiencing the most
significant rise in average winter temperatures.
</p>
<p>
That dreary, muddy weather that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/22/us/christmas-snow-weather-forecast.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">most
of the U.S.</a> saw this past Christmas does, admittedly, happen
sometimes for natural reasons. Same with the incessant rain that fell
(and then turned to ice) across the Midwest and Northeast in
mid-January. With every fraction of a degree the planet warms, however,
events like these become more likely — or, at least, that’s what
hundreds of the world’s leading climate scientists concluded in the
United Nations’ latest synthesis report on the
<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state
of the global climate</a>.
</p>
<h2>
And just to be clear, these rising temperatures are the result of human
activities, most significantly the burning of fossil fuels?
</h2>
<p>
Bingo.
</p>
<h2>
If winter is getting warmer, what’s with these bouts of extreme cold the
U.S. has been getting?
</h2>
<p>
Some evidence suggests that climate change is actually making cold
shocks <em>more</em> likely by destabilizing the polar jet stream, which
keeps the frigid air in the far northern hemisphere from moving too far
southward (and keeps warm air in the tropics from moving too far
northward). As a result, the polar vortex that’s normally confined to
the Arctic is liable to
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/why-extreme-cold-weather-events-still-happen-in-a-warming-world" target="_blank">stretch
south</a> and blast bitterly cold air into the contiguous U.S. That’s
what happened in mid-January, when temperatures in Montana and the
Dakotas
<a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/152333/arctic-chill-sweeps-us" target="_blank">dropped
as low</a> as -30 degrees Fahrenheit and the wind chill bottomed out at
-60 degrees. Cold air from the same weather system blew all the way to
Texas.<br/>
</p>
<p>
That said, this evidence is
<a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2023/02/is-climate-change-affecting-the-polar-vortex/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
rock solid</a>. Whether or not it bears out in the long term, it’s
important to remember that a warmer world doesn’t mean it will
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">never
be cold</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tennessee-valley-authority-record-electricity-ercot-texas" target="_self">Recent
experience</a> notwithstanding, cold snaps — short periods of abnormally
cold weather — are going away, too. Their average duration dropped by
six days between 1970 and 2021, a
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/shrinking-cold-snaps" target="_blank">Climate
Central analysis</a> found.
</p>
<h2>
<span></span>A month ago I thought it would never snow again. Now I’m
shoveling my driveway for the third time this week. Why are some places
suddenly getting even worse snowstorms than usual?
</h2>
<p>
One of the most predictable consequences of climate change is that, as
year-round temperatures soar, an increasing share of annual
precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow. That’s just what you
get when it’s too warm for water vapor to freeze.
</p>
<p>
One of the less obvious consequences, it turns out, is that a warmer
atmosphere holds more moisture, enabling it to
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-a-warming-climate-can-bring-bigger-snowstorms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dump
more precipitation</a> — whether that comes as rain, snow, or wintry mix
— during a single storm. As a result, even though climate change is
making certain places drier, the biggest winter snowstorms are becoming,
well, bigger.
</p>
<p>
This apparent contradiction had a major impact on the parched West in
2023. Drought is expected to become the norm there as the planet warms,
fueling epic wildfires and straining already limited water supplies.
</p>
<p>
But a string of
<a href="https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2023/05/30/how-much-snow-did-alta-ski-area/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">record</a>
<a href="https://www.powder.com/trending-news/jackson-snow-record" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">snowstorms</a>
across the West last winter replenished the region’s dwindling snowpack,
feeding mountain streams and helping
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/california-drought-rainfall-2024" target="_self">keep
drought conditions at bay</a> (and creating a really good year for ski
towns). In California, meanwhile, a barrage of atmospheric rivers
drenched lower elevations and
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/03/15/california-snowfall-record/11435377002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">broke
snowfall records</a> in parts of the Sierra Nevada mountains.
</p>
<p>
California and its neighbors got off to another
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/weather/article/california-storm-total-18621444.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rainy
(and snowy) start</a> in 2024 — though the recent reprieve from years of
severe drought isn’t
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/california-drought-rainfall-2024" target="_self">expected
to last</a>.
</p>
<h2>
I’m raising kids in a place that used to get at least a few inches of
snow each winter, but lately has hardly been getting any. Will my
children know what snow is?
</h2>
<p>
The best answer we can give you today is to say that yes, snow will most
likely still exist. But rising generations probably won’t be able to
count on snow falling — and sticking — with the regularity it did when
you were their age.
</p>
<p>
Climate scientists don’t have a perfect picture of how quickly the
winters we grew up with will give way to a string of months that are
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/10/climate/snow-loss-northern-hemisphere-study-climate/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rainy,
slushy, and unpredictable</a>, but that’s the direction the evidence is
pointing. As global temperatures continue to rise, the trends we’ve seen
in winter weather over the past couple of decades aren’t expected to
reverse course anytime soon.
</p>
<h2>
Are these shifting winter weather patterns impacting other seasons, too?
</h2>
<p>
Many of the ways climate change affects winter are hard to miss. Snow
falls
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/shifting-snow-in-the-warming-u.s" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">later
and less often</a>, and when it does come, it doesn’t last as long. That
comes with a few perks for the average American — such as fewer frigid
winter days — and huge downsides for the communities,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-snow-drought-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ecosystems</a>,
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/ski-snowboard-season-snow-climate-change" target="_self">industries</a>
that depend on winter being snowy and cold.
</p>
<p>
The ramifications of warming winters across the U.S. also extend far
beyond the end of the season. Accelerated snowmelt causes plants to
green and bloom earlier, which can have
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/17/warmer-winters-climate-crisis-scientists" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cascading
effects</a> on soil moisture and drought, as well as on the wildlife
that depend on these plants for food and habitat. If snowpack fails to
accumulate or melts too early, streams will run dry during the hottest
months of the year, when animals, plants, <em>and</em> people need them
most.
</p>
<p>
Traditional strains of some fruit crops — like blueberries, cherries and
peaches, for example —
<a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/climate-matters/fruit-trees-need-winter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">don’t
grow properly</a> in the spring and summer if the preceding winter was
too warm. The increasing volatility of winter weather is also affecting
the success rate of
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-agriculture-crops-georgia-peaches-8fbe7e899207a632418ab6bbdc9f4884" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wintertime
crops</a>, especially in the South. By some estimates, the agriculture
sector’s biggest companies could lose
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/farm-food-investors-face-150-bln-loss-climate-change-report-2022-09-20/#:~:text=Environment-,Farm%20and%20food%20investors%20face%20%24150,on%20climate%20change%2C%20report%20says" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tens
of billions of dollars</a> in value by 2030 because of climate change.
</p>
<p>
And pests like ticks and mosquitoes are not only expanding northward,
they’re also surviving the winter more easily in their historical range,
causing their
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/pubs/vector-borne-disease-final_508.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">populations
to grow</a> and rates of disease transmission to climb.
</p>
<h2>
It’s super warm where I am right now. Is that climate change?
</h2>
<p>
Unfortunately, that’s one question we can’t answer — not for every
instance of unseasonably warm temperatures everywhere in the world. What
we do know for sure is that warmer average temperatures make
unseasonable and extreme weather more likely. So in that sense, yes,
odds are very good that climate change is playing a role in that
thermometer reading.
</p>
<p>
But also, events rarely have just one cause. Climate change could be
exacerbating a natural weather phenomenon, or you might just have gotten
a brief winter reprieve. Whether one sultry February day is “because of
climate change” isn’t really the point. The point is that, unless and
until we stop emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and start
pulling them out, the weather will just keep getting weirder. There is
no new normal.

Scientist Offers Britain Advice on Making Tea; Brits Aren’t Having
It</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LONDON — An American scientist has sparked a trans-Atlantic tempest
in a teapot by offering Britain advice on its favorite hot beverage.</p>
<p>Bryn Mawr College chemistry professor Michelle Francl says one of the
keys to a perfect cup of tea is a pinch of salt. The tip is included in
Francl’s book Steeped: The Chemistry of Tea, published Wednesday by the
Royal Society of Chemistry.</p>
<p>Not since the Boston Tea Party has mixing tea with salt water roiled
the Anglo-American relationship so much.</p>
<p>The salt suggestion drew howls of outrage from tea lovers in Britain,
where popular stereotype sees Americans as coffee-swilling boors who
make tea, if at all, in the microwave.</p>
<p>“Don’t even say the word ‘salt’ to us,” the etiquette guide Debrett’s
wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>The U.S. Embassy in London intervened in the brewing storm with a
social media post reassuring “the good people of the U.K. that the
unthinkable notion of adding salt to Britain’s national drink is not
official United States policy.”</p>
<p>“Let us unite in our steeped solidarity and show the world that when
it comes to tea, we stand as one,” said the tongue-in-cheek post. “The
U.S. Embassy will continue to make tea in the proper way — by
microwaving it.”</p>
<p>The embassy later clarified that its statement was “a lighthearted
play on our shared cultural connections” rather than an official press
release.</p>
<p>Steeped, in contrast, is no joke. The product of three years’
research and experimentation, the book explores the more than 100
chemical compounds found in tea and “puts the chemistry to use with
advice on how to brew a better cup,” its publisher says.</p>
<p>Francl said adding a small amount of salt — not enough to taste —
makes tea seem less bitter because “the sodium ions in salt block the
bitter receptors in our mouths.”</p>
<p>She also advocates making tea in a pre-warmed pot, agitating the bag
briefly but vigorously and serving it in a short, stout mug to preserve
the heat. And she says milk should be added to the cup after the tea,
not before — another issue that often divides tea lovers.</p>
<p>Francl has been surprised by the level of reaction to her book in
Britain.</p>
<p>“I kind of understood that there would hopefully be a lot of
interest,” she told The Associated Press. “I didn’t know we’d wade into
a diplomatic conversation with the U.S. Embassy.”</p>
<p>It has made her ponder the ocean-wide coffee-tea divide that
separates the U.S. and Britain.</p>
<p>“I wonder if we’re just a more caffeinated society — coffee is higher
in caffeine,” she said. “Or maybe we’re just trying to rebel against our
parent country.”</p>

Student Convicted of Stalking, Threatening Pro-Democracy Activist in
US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>boston, Massachusetts — A federal jury in Boston has convicted a
Chinese music student on charges of stalking and harassing one of his
Chinese classmates after she posted flyers in support of democracy in
China around the campus of the Berklee College of Music in the fall of
2022.</p>
<p>According to evidence presented at the trial and court documents,
Xiaolei Wu, 25, sent his classmate online messages in late October of
that year after she posted flyers that read: “We want democracy,” “We
want freedom” and “Stand with the Chinese people.”</p>
<p>Wu threatened to chop off her hands and demanded she tear down the
“reactionary posters.”</p>
<p>Wu also told the individual, who was referred to in court as Zooey,
that he had informed public security authorities in China about her
actions and that they would go to “greet” her family.</p>
<p>During the four-day trial, Wu’s lawyers argued that his comments were
not threats but just an “immature” online dispute between two young
people who knew each other and had different political views. His
lawyers also said he was trying to remind his classmate of the
consequences her actions could have back in China.</p>
<p>However, the federal jury Thursday found Wu guilty on charges of
cyberstalking and threats. Both charges carry a maximum penalty of five
years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to
$250,000. Wu will face sentencing on April 24.</p>
<p>After the guilty verdict was announced, prosecutors requested that Wu
be immediately detained, citing concerns that he is a flight risk and
that Chinese authorities have repeatedly expressed concern about the
case. However, after listening to the opinions of the defense and
prosecutors, Wu was granted bail. The judge said that Wu had not
previously violated the conditions of his bail and that those
requirements would remain in place.</p>
<p>Wu is barred from changing his address, entering the Berklee campus,
or contacting those involved in the case. He has surrendered his
passport and cannot leave the state of Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Case spotlights efforts to quiet critics</p>
<p>Wu’s trial highlights a growing problem that U.S. and other Western
authorities have been working to counter — China’s efforts to silence
its critics abroad.</p>
<p>In a U.S. Department of Justice statement following the announcement
of Wu’s conviction, Acting U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy for the District
of Massachusetts noted the Justice Department’s commitment to free
speech for all.</p>
<p>“No one in this country should ever be subjected to threats of
violence or a cyberstalking harassment campaign for expressing their
political views,” Levy said.</p>
<p>Special Agent in Charge Jodi Cohen of the FBI Boston Division added:
“What Xiaolei Wu did in attempting to silence and intimidate an activist
who expressed dissension with the ruling Communist Party of China is not
only criminal, but completely against our country’s democratic
values.”</p>
<p>VOA reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment on the case but
has yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>Flyers echo protest banner</p>
<p>Wu’s classmate Zooey posted the flyers around Berklee’s campus at a
time when many Chinese around the world were inspired by the courage of
a lone man in Beijing. The man, Peng Lifa, hung a large protest banner
on a bridge on a busy street in the country’s capital in October 2022
with similar slogans.</p>
<p>Some of the slogans on the large banner, such as “We don’t want
[dictatorial] leaders, we want elections” and “We don’t want Cultural
Revolution, we want reform,” were protests against Chinese leader Xi
Jinping.</p>
<p>Other slogans, such as “We don’t want nucleic acid testing, we want
food to eat” and “We don’t want lockdowns, we want freedom,” highlighted
the frustration that many felt at the time with China’s draconian
COVID-19 controls.</p>
<p>Peng was quickly arrested after hanging the banner and remains in
custody at an undisclosed location. Sources told VOA’s Mandarin Service
in October of last year that authorities have yet to deliver any legal
documents related to his case, and his relatives and friends have been
unable to hire a lawyer to provide him with legal assistance.</p>
<p>According to Weiquanwang, a Chinese blog that posts updates on rights
abuses and cases in China, Peng marked his 50th birthday earlier this
month in secret detention. His whereabouts and health condition are
unknown, the site said, quoting an anonymous source.</p>

<h2 id="stop-using-opera-browser-and-opera-gx">Stop using Opera Browser
and Opera GX</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hindenburg alleged that when the Opera browser continued losing users
(due to competition from Google and Apple), the company shifted gears to
building mobile apps that provided predatory short-term loans. The
interest rates on those loans ranged from 365-876% per year, and loan
terms from 7-29 days. Opera also falsely advertised longer loan terms
and lower interest rates in the app descriptions, because the Google
Play Store had rules against predatory loan services. The loan apps
specifically targeted customers in Kenya, India, and Nigeria. Hindenburg
also confirmed through user reports and a former employee that two of
the apps, OKash and OPesa, asked for permission to the phone contacts
during the setup process. The service would then start sending
threatening messages to the user’s contacts when a borrower was late on
their payments. The issue was also covered by local media prior to
Hindenburg’s report. The money from these loan apps amounted to 42.5% of
Opera’s revenue by mid-2019. Yes, almost half of Opera’s revenue came
from extracting money from people in developing countries with false
advertising and direct harassment. ↫ Corbin Davenport As if this wasn’t
horrible enough, Opera also pushed the usual crypto and NFT scams, and
is now chasing that “AI” high by adding spicy autocomplete to its
Chromium skin. Much like Brave – good people don’t let friends use Brave
– Opera is just a veneer around shady business practices, and you just
shouldn’t use this garbage. Just use Firefox.</p>

<h2 id="the-itanic-saga">The Itanic Saga</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>After three years of delays, Merced shipped as Itanium on the 29th of
May in 2001. The first OEM systems from HP, IBM, and Dell were shipped
in June. Itanium, whose architecture was now referred to as IA-64, was a
6-wide VLIW chip running at either 733 to 800 MHz with a 266 MT/s front
side bus. It had 16K of L1 cache, 96K of L2 cache, 2 or 4 MB of L3
cache, and it was a single core chip on socket PAC418 built on a 180nm
process. That this chip under performed is an understatement. Given the
long development time, multi-billion-dollar development cost,
significant hype, and claims that it would out-compete everything on the
market… Itanium was a massive failure. The 32 bit x86 chips of the time
were able to best it in most workloads. Embarrassingly, the Pentium 4
(whose own performance wasn’t that good) beat Itanium on integer
performance and memory bandwidth. Those areas where the chip was strong
were in transaction processing and scientific applications. John
Crawford, Merced project leader at Intel, reflects: “Everything was
crazy. We were taking risks everywhere. Everything was new. When you do
that, you’re going to stumble.” The five hundred person team working on
the chip was also relatively inexperienced, and disagreements between HP
and Intel led to many compromises in design. ↫ Bradford Morgan White
Itanium is the future. This entire article is anti-Itanium propaganda
and misinformation. Do your own research.</p>

id="windows-nt-synchronization-primitives-driver-for-the-linux-kernel-proposed">Windows
NT synchronization primitives driver for the Linux kernel proposed</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-26, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Wine project emulates the Windows API in user space. One
particular part of that API, namely the NT synchronization primitives,
have historically been implemented via RPC to a dedicated “kernel”
process. However, more recent applications use these APIs more
strenuously, and the overhead of RPC has become a bottleneck. The NT
synchronization APIs are too complex to implement on top of existing
primitives without sacrificing correctness. Certain operations, such as
NtPulseEvent() or the “wait-for-all” mode of NtWaitForMultipleObjects(),
require direct control over the underlying wait queue, and implementing
a wait queue sufficiently robust for Wine in user space is not possible.
This proposed driver, therefore, implements the problematic interfaces
directly in the Linux kernel. ↫ Elizabeth Figura on the lkml This
proposed driver would yield some serious performance results.</p>

id="central-asia-seen-as-key-to-breaking-chinas-rare-earth-monopoly">Central
Asia Seen as Key to Breaking China’s Rare Earth Monopoly</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. officials hoping to break China’s near monopoly on
the production of rare earth elements needed for many cutting-edge
technologies should engage the governments of Central Asia to develop
high concentrations of REEs found in the region, says a new report. </p>
<p>The study by the U.S.-based International Tax and Investment Center
warns that a failure to act could leave China with a “decisive
advantage” in the sector, which is crucial to green energy, many new
weapons systems and other advanced technologies. </p>
<p>“As the uses for these minerals has expanded, so too has global
competition for them in a time of sharply increasing geostrategic and
geo-economic tension,” the report says. </p>
<p>“Advanced economies with secure, reliable access to REEs enjoy
economic advantages in manufacturing, and corresponding economic
disadvantages accrue for those without this access.” </p>
<p>China, which accounts for most of the world’s rare earth mining
within its own borders, has not yet had to seek additional supplies from
Central Asia, which enjoys plentiful reserves of minerals ranging from
iron and nonferrous metals to uranium. </p>
<p>But, the report says, “the massive size of the Chinese economy and
the Chinese Communist Party’s conscious efforts to dominate the REE
sector globally mean such increases are a matter of time.”  </p>
<p>Oil-rich Kazakhstan, the region’s economic giant, holds the world’s
largest chromium reserves and the second-largest stocks of uranium,
while also possessing other critical elements.  </p>
<p>Report co-author Ariel Cohen says it is up to the governments of
Central Asia to create the investment climate for development of these
resources.   </p>
<p>“They may be the next big thing in Central Asia as the engine of
economic growth,” Cohen said this week during a panel discussion at the
Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank.  </p>
<p>Across Central Asia, experts note, REEs are found in substantial
volumes in the Kazakh steppe and uplands as well as in the Tien Shan
mountains across Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, and in the Pamir
Mountains in Tajikistan.  </p>
<p>Monazite, zircon, apatite, xenotime, pyrochlore, allanite and
columbite are among Central Asia’s most abundant rare metals and
minerals.  </p>
<p>In 2016, the U.S. Geological Survey listed 384 REE occurrences in the
region: 160 in Kazakhstan, 87 in Uzbekistan, 75 in Kyrgyzstan, 60 in
Tajikistan, and two in Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>Wesley Hill, another expert on Central Asia’s mineral reserves, says
production of rare earths at present “is almost wholly monopolized by
China.”  </p>
<p>“Depending on how you count, between 80 to 90% of REE refining is
controlled by China and done directly inside of China,” Hill said.
  </p>
<p>But, he argued, despite China’s heavy involvement in Central Asia, it
has yet to fully take over the region’s rare earth sector. “So, this
means that Central Asia is very much at a crossroads,” he said. “Central
Asia has the opportunity to expand its REE production without being
wholly dependent on China.” </p>
<p>Central Asia is currently in a position where it can develop its REE
refining capacities both for its national development strategies and to
break the Chinese monopoly, Hill said.  </p>
<p>“But this is only going to happen with good policy, both from the
American side and the Central Asian side.”  </p>
<p>Ambassador John Herbst, Washington’s former top diplomat in
Uzbekistan and Ukraine, says the region’s REE assets are “simply another
reason for enhanced engagement by the West.” </p>
<p>He said he is not sure that Central Asian governments appreciate how
important rare earths can be to their development. “But I do know that
the countries of Central Asia want a closer relationship with the United
States, and that is one important part of their maintaining their
hard-won independence.” </p>
<p>Herbst added that the United States and Central Asia have a common
interest in working together to develop the region’s rare earths “for
the economy of the future.” </p>
<p>“We have an ability to innovate that far exceeds [China’s]. Their
innovation is based largely on taking our technology.”</p>
<p>Suriya Evans-Pritchard Jayanti, who serves as energy transition
counsel at the U.S. Department of Commerce, says the region is eager for
investment. </p>
<p>“It is a development opportunity. Particularly with the geostrategic
energy realignment after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but also,
because of the energy transition. Lithium and other REE are necessary
for different parts of that transition. So that’s primarily an economic
incentive,” she said. </p>
<p>She pointed to the Mineral Strategic Partnership Initiative run by
the U.S. State Department’s Bureau on Energy Resources, which is able to
promote foreign direct investment in the region while providing
technical assistance in the mining sector. </p>
<p>Cohen said the Central Asian countries cannot wait long to develop
their rare earths. “There is a competition, and the African countries,
Latin American countries and others will compete increasingly.”  </p>
<p>Wilder Alejandro Sanchez, who heads a consultancy called Second Floor
Strategies, says Central Asia needs a rare earth research center that
can provide timely information to prospective customers and investors.
 </p>
<p>Transportation is key, Sanchez said. “It’s not just about finding and
mining them. You have to get them to the international market.”  </p>
<p>Access from the landlocked region at present is limited to China’s
Belt and Road infrastructure or routes through Russia. Sanchez and
others recommend using the Middle Corridor, also called the
Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, which can carry goods to
Europe across the Caspian and Black seas.  </p>
<p>These experts also say progress will depend on regional governments
overcoming their traditional secretiveness regarding natural resources.
They emphasize the importance of transparency, the rule of law,
adherence to best practices and compliance with international norms if
they hope to attract Western investment.</p>

id="biden-to-host-japan-pm-kishida-for-official-visit-in-april">Biden to
Host Japan PM Kishida for Official Visit in April</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Joe Biden will host Japanese
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for an official visit to the United States
on April 10, the White House said  Thursday. </p>
<p>The formal event, which will include a state dinner and a policy
meeting, follows a promise by Biden to host the closely allied nation
key to the United States’ strategy toward China, North Korea and other
Asian security issues. </p>
<p>Biden and Kishida will discuss “efforts to strengthen our political,
security, economic and people-to-people ties” to improve Indo-Pacific
security, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. </p>
<p>The visit comes at a challenging time for both leaders, who have low
public approval ratings at home. Biden is likely facing a close-fought
November election against Republican Donald Trump, and Kishida is
managing the fallout from a fundraising scandal, economic difficulty and
a major earthquake this month. </p>
<p>“2024 will be a pivotal year for Japan-U.S. relations,” Japan’s
ambassador to Washington, Shigeo Yamada, said in prerecorded remarks to
an event hosted by the Wilson Center think tank on Thursday. </p>
<p>“The Japan alliance is indispensable to the peace, stability and
prosperity not only of our two countries, but also of the international
community,” he said.  </p>
<p>Mieko Nakabayashi, a professor at Japan’s Waseda University, told
Washington’s Wilson Center there was growing concern in Japan about the
prospect of a second presidency for Trump, who has questioned the value
of alliances and complained about cost of U.S troop deployments in Japan
and South Korea. </p>
<p>“We are very, very worried, and we are thinking about a variety of
scenarios of whoever becomes the president of the United States,” she
said.</p>
<p>Nakabayashi also said factional rivalries inside Japan’s ruling
Liberal Democratic Party raised questions about whether Kishida could
hold on to power long enough to make the visit. </p>
<p>Frank Jannuzi, president and chief executive officer of Washington’s
Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation, told the think tank the
U.S.-Japan alliance was long-standing but not unbreakable. </p>
<p>“The easiest way to break it … would be for the United States to in
the future somehow compromise the extent of our commitment to the
security of our allies in Northeast Asia,” he said. </p>
<p>U.S. deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said the Biden
administration took a “very different” view from that of Trump. </p>
<p>“America’s network of alliances … are a force multiplier for U.S.
interests,” he told an Asia Society event. “They are a unique advantage
that the United States has among our nearest peer competitors, not a
burden on the country.” </p>
<p>While the security relationship between the U.S. and Japan has been
growing ever stronger and they are looking to make a deal for Japanese
shipyards to overhaul and maintain U.S. Navy warships, Nippon Steel’s
proposed purchase of U.S. Steel is a source of controversy. </p>
<p>Democratic and Republican U.S. senators have criticized the deal,
citing national security concerns or raising questions about why the
companies did not consult U.S. Steel’s main union ahead of the
announcement. </p>
<p>Brian Deese, a key player in Biden’s reelection bid, said last month
that the proposed purchase was concerning and that the administration
should look closely at it.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Every few months, corporate earnings announcements give us the chance to
(pretty literally) take stock of how the energy transition is going.
After a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-power-solaredge-enphase-empire-wind-2-equinor" target="_blank">rocky
end-of-year for many renewables companies</a>, this earnings season was,
perhaps, more warily anticipated than most.
</p>
<p>
A bunch of energy companies reported this week, ranging from fossil fuel
stalwarts to the bleeding edge of decarbonization and in between. The
results indicate an industry that’s a bit unsure of itself — showing
promising signs overall, but with lots still to figure out, especially
in how to make
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_blank">offshore
wind</a> a real business. Everyone expects growth, but turning that
growth in consistent profits can be tricky.
</p>
<p>
Here are four takeaways from a mixed bag:
</p>
<h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>TL;DR: Look at GE.
</h2>
<p>
GE’s renewable energy business is a kind of snapshot for utility scale
investment: it’s doing a lot, but at least for now struggling to make
money and taking a bath on offshore wind. The business reported both a
fourth quarter loss and a full-year loss for 2023, but its onshore wind
turbine business was profitable, as was its business servicing the
electric grid. Offshore wind, meanwhile, remained something of a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/offshore-wind-power-cost-expensive" target="_blank">money
suck</a>.
</p>
<p>
So while <strong> </strong>one large offshore wind order was cancelled
(<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/why-america-s-wind-power-failures-are-good-for-ge" target="_blank">likely
a New Jersey project</a>), GE’s renewables head Scott Strazik said the
massive
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/permian-basin-wind-jobs-sunzia" target="_blank">SunZia
wind project</a> in the Southwest was still full steam ahead with an
order for 2.4 gigawatts worth of wind capacity.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Transmission is hot right now.
</h2>
<p>
The rush to build out new power lines to deliver new electricity also
buoyed GE’s business, with “a number of large [high voltage direct
current] orders” — infrastructure for sending power over long distances
— and a 40% jump in orders for power transformers, equipment necessary
to help move electricity. “There’s a lot of healthy demand across
renewables that we expect to continue into 2024,” Strazik said.
</p>
<p>
That demand is coming from
<a href="https://www.investor.nexteraenergy.com/~/media/Files/N/NEE-IR/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/2024/01-25-24/4Q%202023%20Slides%20vF.pdf" target="_blank">companies
like NextEra</a>, <strong> </strong>which combines a regulated utility
in Florida with a wind, solar, and storage development business. The
company told investors in a presentation on Thursday that it “continues
to see strong demand for new renewables and storage,” and had added
9,000 megawatts of combined renewables and storage in 2023. The company
said it would spend almost $2 billion to build out transmission through
2027, creating a virtuous cycle with manufacturers like GE.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Storage is taking off.
</h2>
<p>
If NextEra is on one end of the storage business, then Tesla is on the
other. The former builds out utility-scale battery operations,
<a href="https://www.nexteraenergy.com/company/work/battery-storage.html" target="_blank">often
on the same sites as solar projects</a>, and could “operate up to 53
gigawatts of generation with the potential to co-locate battery
storage,” its chief executive John Ketchum told investors.
</p>
<p>
In
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tesla-earnings-call-model-y-3-cybertruck" target="_blank">Tesla’s
earnings call</a> on Wednesday, meanwhile, CEO Elon Musk spotlighted the
company’s Tesla Energy business, which sells the Powerwall battery and
solar system, as an area of high growth while its core auto business
goes through a period of transition. A new model code-named
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-redwood-iea-electricity" target="_blank">Redwood</a>”
coming, Musk said, in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Musk said the company’s energy storage business “delivered nearly 15
GW-hours of batteries in 2023, compared to 6.5 GW-hours the year
before,” growth he described as “tremendous.” And while investors were
miffed that Tesla didn’t provide a forecast for growth in car sales —
which implied it wouldn’t hit its traditional 50% target — Musk was
happy to say that he thought the company’s storage business “would grow
much faster than the car business.”
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Don’t count out fossil fuels.
</h2>
<p>
While the oil majors have yet to release their fourth quarter earnings,
the market got a hint at how things were going from the results released
by Halliburton, the oil services firm that’s also a major player in
fracking.
</p>
<p>
The company hiked up its dividend and reported both revenue and profit
growth in 2023. Overall, the business was the most profitable it had
been “in over a decade,” the company’s chief financial officer, Eric
Carre, told analysts.
</p>
<p>
It did, however, note that the footprint of its North American business
was shrinking as the number of active oil rigs had declined, and that it
expected “flattish revenue and margin environment,” the company’s chief
executive, Jeff Miller, added. Meanwhile, overseas, Miller <em>
</em>said he expected industry spending to “grow at a low double-digit
pace,” with “multiple years of sustained activity growth.”<br/> <br/> He
did not, however, expect an end to oil any time soon. “[The] long-term
expansion of the global economy will continue to create enormous demands
on all forms of energy,” Miller said. “I expect oil and gas remains a
critical component of the global energy mix with demand growth well into
the future.”

Warned Iran of ISIS-K Threat Ahead of Deadly Blasts, US Official
Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. government privately warned Iran that the
Islamic State group’s affiliate in Afghanistan was preparing to carry
out a terrorist attack before bombings in Kerman earlier this month that
killed 95 people, a U.S. official said Thursday. </p>
<p>The official, who was not authorized to comment and insisted on
anonymity to discuss the intelligence, said the U.S. was following its
long-standing policy of a “duty to warn” other governments against
potential lethal threats. </p>
<p>The official did not detail how the United States, which does not
have diplomatic relations with Iran, conveyed the warning about its
intelligence on ISIS-Khorasan, known as ISIS-K, but noted that
government officials “provide these warnings in part because we do not
want to see innocent lives lost in terror attacks.” </p>
<p>Iranian state media did not acknowledge the U.S. giving Tehran the
information, and Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not
immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the CSIS think
tank in Washington, said the warning may reflect a wider U.S. desire to
seek dialogue with Iran despite recent attacks by Iranian-backed proxies
on U.S., Israeli and other Western interests and the advances of
Tehran’s nuclear program. </p>
<p>“This is an olive branch,” Alterman said, adding that U.S. President
Joe Biden’s administration came into office believing dialogue between
Washington and Tehran could benefit both sides.  </p>
<p>Aaron David Miller of Washington’s Wilson Center think tank largely
concurred, noting the failed efforts on the nuclear deal and the
improbability of transforming relations that have been largely
antagonistic since the Islamic Republic’s birth. </p>
<p>“You can’t transform the U.S.-Iranian relationship. All you can do is
to look for opportunities … to transact, to de-escalate and avoid an
escalatory ladder that would lead to war,” he said.  </p>
<p>The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the January 3
attack on Kerman, about 820 kilometers (510 miles) southeast of Iran’s
capital, Tehran. The dual suicide bombing killed at least 95 people and
wounded dozens of others attending a commemoration for the late General
Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guard’s expeditionary
Quds Force, who was killed in a 2020 U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. </p>
<p>In the time since, Iran has been trying to blame the U.S. and Israel
for the attack amid Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. It has
launched missile attacks on Iraq and Syria. It then launched strikes on
nuclear-armed Pakistan, which responded with its own strikes on Iran,
further raising tensions in a region inflamed by the Israel-Hamas
war. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal was first to report that the U.S. had
provided the warning to Iran. </p>
<p>ISIS-K was behind the August 2021 suicide bombing at the Kabul
airport that killed 13 U.S. troops and about 170 Afghans during the
chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. </p>
<p>ISIS-K has thousands of members and is the Taliban’s most bitter
enemy and top military threat. The group has continued to carry out
attacks in Afghanistan and beyond since the Taliban takeover.</p>

<h2 id="positive-internalization">Positive Internalization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is my entry for
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/indieweb-carnival-january-2024-positive-internalization/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">January’s
IndieWeb Carnival</a>, hosted by
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">foreverliketh.is</a>
on the topic of positive internalisation, hence the title of this post.
</p>
<p>
When I first read the topic for this month I thought it was going to be
an easy write:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Your entry for this month’s carnival will have you intentionally seek
out positive memories. Memories that remind you of the good parts of
yourself; the facets of your being that you want to see more of, that
you wish to nurture and grow.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I was wrong. Extracting memories that remind me about the good parts of
myself is hard. Painfully hard. And that’s because each good memory is
covered by a veil of self-criticism and self-doubt. And the older I grow
the more that vision of myself solidifies: I’m convinced I’m not good
enough, I’m not smart enough, but also don’t have enough willpower to
change any of that. Was I always like this? I honestly can’t tell you.
</p>
<p>
The only genuinely happy memories I have are not tied to me but to
others. Doing something—no matter how big or small—for someone else is
one of the few things in life that can consistently make me happy. This
is especially great when that someone else is a stranger. We live in
such a sad world that people are genuinely surprised when you go out of
your way to help them just because you want to be kind.
</p>
<p>
Actually, now that I think about it, there is something I used to do
that I want back. Years ago, when I was still in high school, I used to
walk around the city, listening to music, and having a great time
smiling at people. It was such a great way to live my life. Rather than
looking down and marching towards my destination I was taking my time,
walking slowly, smiling at random people on the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>
I kinda loved that version of me and I’m sure it’s still there
somewhere. I only need to figure out how to bring it out again.
</p>
<p>
Eden, I’m not sure this nonsense I just wrote fits with the topic you
set up for January’s carnival but since I know you read my blog you know
I’m all over the place with my thinking and so this is what you gonna
get.
</p>
<p>
As for everyone else, the carnival needs hosts for the months of July,
August, September, October, and November. If you have a blog and—like
me—love the IndieWeb you should consider becoming a host for one of
those months. You can do it by calming your spot on the
<a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">wiki page of the
carnival</a>

Over the past few months, a new type of washer-dryer combo has emerged
on the scene in North America (Yes, Europe and Asia have had great, tiny
heat pump tech for decades). These new big combo units from
<a href="https://howl.me/cluQzObYr4O">GE Profile UltraFast

weeks, and the <a href="https://howl.me/cluQA93PVMs">LG</a> is on the
way for testing head-to-head, but for now, I want to tell you about all
of the ways both of these things are amazing, and energy savings is just
the tip of the iceberg…

Tabs give me superpowers (25 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Tabs give me superpowers: Lifehacks are good, actually.
Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004,
2009, 2014, 2019 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Tabs give me
superpowers (permalink) “Lifehacking” is in pretty bad odor these days,
and with good reason: a once-useful catch-all for describing how to make
things easier has become a pit of productivity porn, grifter hustling,
and anodyne advice wreathed in superlatives and transformed into
SEO-compliant listicles. But I was there when lifehacking was born, and
I’m here to tell you, it wasn’t always thus. Lifehacking attained
liftoff exactly 19 years and 348 days ago, on Feb 11, 2004, when Danny
O’Brien presented “Life Hacks: Tech Secrets of Overprolific Alpha Geeks”
at the 0’Reilly Emerging Technology Conference (aka ETCON). I was there,
and I took notes: https://craphound.com/lifehacksetcon04.txt O’Brien’s
inspiration was his social circle, in which people he knew to be no
smarter or better or motivated than anyone else in that group were
somehow able to do much more than their peers, in some specific domain.
O’Brien delved deeply into these peoples’ lives and discovered that each
of them had merely (“merely!”) gotten very good at using one or two
tools to automate things that would otherwise take up a lot of their
time. These “hacks” freed up their practitioners to focus on things that
mattered more to them. They accomplished the goal set out in David
Allen’s Getting Things Done: to make a conscious choice about which
things you are going to fail to do today, rather than defaulting to
doing the things that are easy and trivial, at the expense of the things
that matter, but are more complicated:
https://gettingthingsdone.com/what-is-gtd/ One trait all those lifehacks
shared: everyone who created a little hack was faintly embarrassed by
it, and assumed that others who learned about their tricks would find
them trivial or foolish. O’Brien changed the world by showing that other
people were, in fact, delighted and excited to learn about their peers’
cool little tricks. (Unfortunately, this eventually opened the
floodgates of overheated posts about some miraculous hack that turned
out to indeed be silly and trivial or even actively bad, but that wasn’t
O’Brien’s fault!) I’m one of those people whom others perceive as very
“productive.” There are some objective metrics on which this is true: I
wrote nine books during lockdown, for example. Like the lifehackers
O’Brien documented in 2004, I have lots of little hacks that aren’t
merely a way of getting more done – they’re a way to make sure that I
get the stuff that matters to me (taking care of my family and my
health, and writing books) done. A lot of these lifehacks boil down to
making your life easier. There’s a spot on our kitchen counter where I
put e-waste. Whenever I go out to the car, I carry any e-waste out and
put it in a bag in the trunk. Any time I’m near our city dump, I stop
and throw the bag into their e-waste bin. This is now a habit, and
habits are things you get for free: I spend zero time thinking about
e-waste, which means I have more time to think about things that matter
(and our e-waste still ends up in the right place). There’s other ways I
use habits to make my life easier: after many years, I learned how to
write every day: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/22/walking-the-plank/
For longer-form works like novels, I “leave myself a rough edge,”
finishing the day’s work in the middle of a sentence. That way I get a
few words for free the next day, meaning I never start the day’s work
wondering which words I’ll type:
https://locusmag.com/2014/01/cory-doctorow-cheap-writing-tricks/ One of
the most powerful habits I’ve cultivated is to have a group of daily
tabs that I open in a new browser every morning. The meat of this tab
group is websites I want to check in with every day, either because they
don’t have RSS feeds, or because I want to make sure I never miss an
update. This tab-group habit started before RSS was widespread, when
most of the websites I wanted to check in on every day didn’t have feeds
yet, and for many years, this group was just a set of daily reads. But
over the years, I started throwing things in the tab-group that I needed
to stay on top of. My daily tabs are in a folder called “unfucked rota”
(they were originally in a folder called “rota,” which got corrupted and
had to be reconstructed in a folder I called “fucked rota,” until I
finally took a couple hours off and got it in good running order, hence
“unfucked rota”). As I type this, “unfucked rota” contains more than a
hundred websites I visit every morning, but it also contains: The
edit-history pages for four Wikipedia entries I’m watching;
Chronological feeds of my books on Amazon and Audible, to catch
counterfeits as they are posted; The parent notification portal for my
kid’s school; The mileage history for the airline I flew on yesterday
(I’ll delete this once the flight is posted); The credit card history
for a card I reported a fraudulent charge on (I’ll delete this once the
refund is posted); The sell-pages for three products that are out of
stock (I’ll delete these once the products are in stock and ordered); A
bookmarked newest-first Ebay search for a shirt I like that has been
discontinued by the manufacturer; The new-survey-completed pages for my
last two Kickstarters; The courier tracking page for an item being
shipped sea-freight to me from Asia. The tail end of this unfucked rota
changes all the time, but as you can tell, it’s got a lot of stuff that
would be time-consuming to build a whole new system to track, but which
has a web-page that can be easily added to a daily, habitual check-in
and then removed when it’s not relevant anymore. Some of these things
have email notifiers or RSS feeds, but those are too easy to lose in the
noise. I generally delete email from ecommerce sites unread, since
99.99% of the messages they send me are unsolicited marketing nonsense,
not the “notify me when this is back in stock” message I do want to see
(same goes for my kid’s school, which sends me fifty unimportant
messages for every message that I must reply to). Most of the internet
is still on the web, which means it can be bookmarked, which means that
it takes me one second to add it to the group of things I’m staying on
top of, and one second to remove from that group. I get up in the
morning, middle-click the “unfucked rota” item in my bookmarks pane,
make a cup of coffee, and then sit down and race through those tabs,
close-close-close. It takes less than a second to scan a tab to see if
it’s changed (and if I close a tab too quickly, the ctrl-shift-T
“unclose” shortcut is there in muscle-memory, another habit). The whole
process takes between one and 15 minutes (depending on whether there’s
anything useful and new in one of those tabs). Tabs, like lifehacks, are
also in bad odor. Everyone stresses about how many tabs they have open.
It’s even inspired Rusty Foster’s excellent newsletter, Today In Tabs:
https://www.todayintabs.com/ But this is a very different way to think
about tabs. Rather than opening a window full of tabs that need your
detailed, once-off attention later, this method is about using groups of
tabs so that you can pay cursory, frequent attention to them. In a world
full of administrative burdens, where firms and institutions play the
“sure, we’ll do that, but you’re going to have to track our progress”
game to get out of living up to their obligations, this method is a
powerful countermeasure:
https://memex.craphound.com/2015/02/02/david-graebers-the-utopia-of-rules-on-technology-stupidity-and-the-secret-joys-of-bureaucracy/
My little tab habit is so incredibly useful, such a powerful way to
seize back time and power from powerful actors who impose burdens on me,
that I sometimes forget how, for other people, tabs are a symptom of a
life that’s spiraling out of control. For me, a couple hundred tabs are
a symbol of a couple hundred tasks that I’m totally on top of, a symbol
of control wrestled back from others who are hostile to my interests.
This isn’t how tabs were “meant” to be used, of course. It’s an example
of the kind of “innovation” that comes from users repurposing things in
ways their designers didn’t necessarily anticipate or intend. This is
what Jonathan Zittrain meant by “generative” technology back in 2008,
when he published his incredibly prescient The Future of the Internet:
And How To Stop It:
https://memex.craphound.com/2008/07/22/zittrains-the-future-of-the-internet-how-to-save-the-internet-from-the-internet/
For Zittrain, “generativity” was the property of some technologies that
let its users generate new, useful tools and solutions for themselves
(this is very different from “generative AI!”) Zittrain described how
“curated” computing systems, like mobile devices that relied on apps
that couldn’t be adapted by their users, were dead ends for
generativity. 15 years later, the dismal world of apps has proven him
right:
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/24/everything-not-mandatory/#is-prohibited
To the extent that “lifehacking” is about doing more, rather than being
more deliberate about what you accomplish, it can be harmful. I am not
immune to the failure modes of lifehacking:
https://locusmag.com/2017/11/cory-doctorow-how-to-do-everything-lifehacking-considered-harmful/
But overall, using tabs as something I close, rather than something I
open, is a source of comfort and calm for me. For one thing, ripping
through a group of tabs every morning means that I don’t have to worry
about missing something if I go too fast. I’ll get another chance
tomorrow: https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/27/probably/ Decades ago, Dori
Smith dubbed her pioneering blog her “#Backup Brain”:
https://web.archive.org/web/20020120231027/http://www.backupbrain.com/
At their best, our systems – be they physical, like a spot on the
counter where the e-waste goes, or digital, like a tab-group – are
“congitive prostheses.” They allow us to move important things from the
highly contested, busy and precious space between our ears and out there
into the world: https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/
Like those lifehackers that O’Brien studied for his presentation in
2004, I confess to feeling a little silly about telling you all about
this. For me, this habit of decades is so ingrained that it feels
trivial and obvious. And yet, when I look at people in my life
struggling to stay on top of a million nagging administrative tasks that
could be easily watched through a morning’s flick through a tab-group, I
can’t help but think that maybe some of you will find a useful idea or
two in my unfucked rota. Hey look at this (permalink) Am I My

id="former-trump-aide-navarro-gets-4-month-sentence-for-defying-january-6-subpoena">Former
Trump Aide Navarro Gets 4-Month Sentence for Defying January 6
Subpoena</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Trump White House official Peter Navarro, who was
convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with a
congressional investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S.
Capitol, was sentenced on Thursday to four months behind bars. </p>
<p>He was the second Trump aide convicted of contempt of Congress
charges, after former White House adviser Steve Bannon, who also got a
four-month sentence but is free pending appeal. </p>
<p>Navarro was found guilty of defying a subpoena for documents and a
deposition from the House January 6 committee. He served as a White
House trade adviser under then-President Donald Trump and later promoted
the Republican’s baseless claims of mass voter fraud in the 2020
election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. </p>
<p>He has vowed to appeal the verdict, saying he couldn’t cooperate with
the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. A judge
barred him from making that argument at trial, however, finding that he
didn’t show Trump had actually invoked it. </p>
<p>Navarro said in court before his sentencing Thursday that the House
committee investigating the January 6 attack had led him to believe that
it accepted his invocation of executive privilege. “Nobody in my
position should be put in conflict between the legislative branch and
the executive branch,” he told the judge. </p>
<p>The judge told Navarro that it took “chutzpah” for him to assert that
he accepted responsibility for his actions while also suggesting that
his prosecution was politically motivated. “You are not a victim. You
are not the object of a political prosecution,” the judge said. “These
are circumstances of your own making.” </p>
<p>Navarro’s lawyers had advised him not to address the judge, but he
said he wanted to speak after hearing the judge express disappointment
in him. Responding to a question about why he didn’t initially seek a
lawyer’s counsel, he told the judge, “I didn’t know what to do,
sir.” </p>
<p>The judge is allowing Navarro’s defense to submit a written brief on
the question of allowing him to remain free pending appeal. </p>
<p>Justice Department prosecutors said Navarro tried to “hide behind
claims of privilege” even before he knew what the committee wanted,
showing a “disdain” for the committee that should warrant a longer
sentence. Prosecutors had asked a judge to sentence him to six months
behind bars and impose a $200,000 fine. </p>
<p>Defense attorneys said Trump did claim executive privilege, putting
Navarro in an “untenable position,” and they asked for a sentence of
probation and a $100 fine. </p>
<p>Bannon, who also made executive-privilege arguments, was convicted of
two counts.</p>
<p>Navarro’s sentencing comes after a judge rejected his bid for a new
trial. His attorneys had argued that jurors may have been improperly
influenced by political protesters outside the courthouse when they took
a break from deliberations. Shortly after their break, the jurors found
Navarro guilty of two misdemeanor counts of contempt of Congress.</p>
<p>But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta found that Navarro didn’t show
that the eight-minute break had any effect on the September verdict. He
found no protest was underway and no one approached the jurors — they
interacted only with each other and the court officer assigned to
accompany them.</p>

id="apple-to-allow-sideloading-alternative-application-stores-alternative-browser-engines-lower-costs-and-more-on-ios-but-only-in-the-eu">Apple
to allow sideloading, alternative application stores, alternative
browser engines, lower costs, and more on iOS, but only in the EU</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: OS News</p>
<p>In order to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act, Apple has
announced a set of sweeping changes to iOS and the App Store in the
European Union. First and foremost, starting with iOS 17.4, users in the
European Union will be able to download and install applications from
outside of the App Store. On top of that, alternative application stores
will become possible as well. When a developer submits an application to
Apple, the developer can choose to distribute the application through
the App Store, alternative application stores, or both. Apple will not
charge a commission on installations from outside the App Store, and it
will also allow alternative payment processors, over which Apple will
also not charge any additional fees. Apple will, however, charge
something called a “Core Technology Fee”. Under the new terms, apps
distributed through the App Store which choose to use an alternative
payment system will pay a 17 percent commission (rather than 30 percent)
on digital goods and services. This commission rate falls to 10 percent
for any apps that currently qualify for Apple’s reduced “small business”
rate. The additional 3 percent fee then applies for developers who
choose to use Apple’s payment processing system. The company is also
introducing a new type of fee for particularly popular apps. The new
Core Technology Fee will charge developers €0.50 (around 54 cents) per
annual app install; however, this fee only kicks in after a million
annual installs in the EU. Apple estimates that over 99 percent of
developers will either “reduce or maintain the fees they owe to Apple”
under the new business terms and that “less that 1 percent” of
developers would pay a core technology fee. ↫ Jon Porter at The Verge
Overall, developers in the EU will be paying a lot less to Apple than
developers in the US and elsewhere, while also gaining more options of
distributing their applications outside of the App Store. I’m already
seeing some serious rumblings in Apple developer circles over on
Mastodon, where US-based developers are not happy these serious cost
reductions will only apply to EU developers. The only kink in the cable
is this “Core Technology Fee”, though, as the total bill for that
nebulous cost can balloon quickly. Apple will still check applications
outside of the App Store for safety, security, and privacy, though, with
a system very similar to how macOS handles applications outside of the
Mac App Store right now through a new – to iOS – notarisation system.
This notarisation will not check applications for quality (because as we
all know, the App Store is a beacon of quality) or content (hello
emulators!). Another major change coming to iOS is the availability of
browsers other than Safari. Right now, even if you think you’re using an
alternative, non-Safari browser on iOS, you’re really just using a skin
on top of a hobbled version of Safari. In the EU, starting with iOS
17.4, non-WebKit browser engines like Firefox’ Gecko or Chrome’s Blink
can come to iOS, and live as equal citizens on your iOS device.
Furthermore, NFS on iOS will be opening up in Europe, giving European
users the ability to use services other than Apple Pay and Wallet with
NFC, and even set them as default. Apple is also allowing game streaming
services to come to iOS, and this change happens to be available
worldwide instead of being restricted to just the EU. These are sweeping
changes to how iOS and the App Store works, but much to the chagrin of
US-based users and developers in my Mastodon timeline and elsewhere,
they’re exclusive to the European Union. It’s unclear if Americans can
import EU devices to gain access to these new features, or if they need
EU-based Apple IDs. Let the grey market provide.</p>

Apple has made good on its promise to add Stolen Device Protection to
iOS 17.3, allowing users concerned about iPhone passcode and
snatch-and-run theft to require biometric authentication and sometimes a
delay to carry out critical security and financial actions. We look at
what it does and doesn’t protect, how to turn it on, and who can’t use
it.

Wraps Up Four-Nation Africa Tour, Commits to Ongoing Security, Economic
Partnership</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said
Thursday the United States will continue intensive engagement with
African partners in hopes of resolving the ongoing conflicts in the
Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>Blinken held talks Thursday with Angolan President Joao Lourenco in
which they discussed “concrete ways” to achieve “a durable peace” in the
DRC’s conflict-ridden eastern region.</p>
<p>These discussions come against a backdrop of escalating tensions
between Rwanda and the DRC, marked by several alleged cross-border
attacks by Congolese and Rwandan forces.</p>
<p>“The United States very much appreciates President Lourenco’s
continued efforts to de-escalate tensions between Rwanda and the DRC. We
believe that the Luanda process, in tandem with the Nairobi process, is
the best hope for enduring peace. Angola is trusted by all sides.
President Lourenco’s leadership is vital for breakthrough,” said Blinken
during a press conference before wrapping up the visit, which was part
of a four-nation tour of Africa.</p>
<p>The chronic and escalating conflicts in eastern Congo have led
regional countries to initiate two peace processes. The Nairobi Process
is aimed at the disarmament of rebel groups within the DRC, while the
Luanda Process focuses on resolving tensions between the DRC and its
neighbor, Rwanda, which the DRC accuses of supporting the M23 rebel
group. Rwanda denies the accusation.</p>
<p>In his meeting with Angolan Foreign Minister Tete Antonio, Blinken
discussed the U.S.-Angola bilateral relationship, emphasizing the
growing cooperation with Luanda in major railway infrastructure projects
and outer space exploration.</p>
<p>“The United States has committed funding to refurbish the existing
1,300-kilometer Lobito Atlantic Railway. And we’ve taken the first steps
to build out 800 kilometers a new rail reaching Zambia, including
through a consortium with Angola and other partners,” said Blinken
during a joint press conference.</p>
<p>Blinken said these projects are the biggest investment the United
States has made in railways on the African continent in over a
generation and are central to the partnership for global infrastructure
investment work in Angola.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the U.S. and Angola signed the Artemis Accords, a
set of principles to guide space exploration cooperation among
nations.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, the U.S. has significantly increased its
military assistance to Angola, providing more than $18 million from 2020
to 2023. In the coming year, the U.S. will explore new opportunities to
expand capacity-building efforts in cybersecurity and for Angola’s Navy,
according to the State Department.</p>
<p>Blinken began his four-nation tour of Africa on Monday. Besides
Angola, the trip included stops in Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, and
Nigeria.</p>
<p>In Cape Verde’s capital Praia, Blinken met with Prime Minister
Ulisses Correia e Silva and toured Porto da Praia, modernized with U.S.
Millennium Challenge Corporation funding. Blinken praised Cape Verde for
being the first country to complete two Millennium Challenge Corporation
compacts and starting a third. He also acknowledged Cape Verde’s WHO
certification as malaria-free.</p>
<p>In Ivory Coast, Blinken met with President Alassane Ouattara and
announced $45 million in new funding to help the West African country
and its neighbors prevent conflict and promote stability amid regional
threats. This contribution brings the total U.S. stability-focused
assistance in coastal West Africa to nearly $300 million since 2022.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast borders three countries that have experienced coups in
recent years: Guinea in September 2021; Mali in August 2020 and May
2021; and Burkina Faso in January and September 2022.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, Blinken held talks focused on regional security with
President Bola Tinubu and Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar.</p>
<p>Nigeria shares a border with Niger, where the military ousted its
elected leader, Mohamed Bazoum, in July 2023.</p>
<p>Highlighting Nigeria’s role in the Economic Community of West African
States, or ECOWAS, Blinken commended its efforts toward restoring
constitutional order and democracy in Niger.</p>
<p>During a press conference in Abuja, Blinken said the United States is
determined to remain a strong security partner for Nigeria, a key
partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist insurgents in West
Africa.</p>
<p>The chief U.S. diplomat’s trip to three countries in West Africa, and
one in southern Africa, Angola, comes as Washington seeks to deepen its
economic and security partnerships in regions where China and Russia
have made significant inroads.</p>

Coolest Thing in Climate Tech is a Super Hot Rock</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDk3NTczOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDQ3MjkxMn0.02OFifb2o4JbEkVsHX5ARUnqwySd6P--p6ZDfwPZ08I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
One of the oldest ways to store up energy is in hot rocks. Egyptians
built adobe homes millennia ago that absorbed heat during the day and
released it at night, and wood-fired ovens with bricks that radiate
residual heat have been around since the Middle Ages.
</p>
<p>
Now, this ancient form of heating is poised for a breakout year as one
of the hottest things in climate tech: thermal batteries. These aren’t
the kinds of batteries you’d find in a laptop or electric vehicle.
Instead, these stationary, shipping container-sized units can provide
the high temperatures necessary to power hard-to-decarbonize industrial
processes like smelting or chemical manufacturing. And thanks to the
changing economics of clean energy and a generous tax credit in Biden’s
Inflation Reduction Act, investors are increasingly bullish about the
technology, helping Silicon Valley startups Antora Energy and Rondo
Energy dramatically scale up production with new gigafactories.
</p>
<p>
The underlying technology is fairly basic. Using essentially the
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-storage/this-startups-energy-storage-tech-is-essentially-a-giant-toaster" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">same
technology as a toaster, electricity from renewable energy is converted
into heat and then</a> stored in thermally conductive rocks or bricks.
That heat is then delivered directly as hot air or steam to the
industrial facilities that the stationary batteries are sited on. Rondo
says it can supply continuous heat at full capacity — that’s over 1,000°
Celsius — for 16 to 18 hours, and Antora’s system is rated at 25 hours,
helping fill the gaps when sun and wind resources are scarce.

</p>
<p>
The climate benefits of this process are clear — and potentially huge.
Heat alone comprises half of the world’s total energy consumption, and
about 10% of global CO2 emissions come from burning fossil fuels to
generate the high temperatures necessary for industrial processes like
steel and cement production, chemicals manufacturing, and minerals
smelting and refining. These industries are notoriously hard to
decarbonize because burning gas or coal has been much cheaper than using
electricity to generate high heat.
</p>
<p>
That’s also why we haven’t traditionally heard a lot about thermal
batteries. Before renewables became ubiquitous, the tech just wouldn’t
have been very clean or very cheap.
</p>
<p>
But thanks to the rapidly falling cost of wind and solar, its economics
are looking increasingly promising. “There’s this glut of cheap, clean
power that is just waiting to be used,” Justin Briggs, Antora’s
co-founder and COO, told me. “It’s just going to waste in a lot of cases
already.”
</p>
<p>
John O’Donnell, the co-founder and CEO of Rondo, concurred.“This
industrial decarbonization is going to start out absolutely absorbing
those negative and zero prices,” he told me. “But it is also going to
drive massive new construction of new renewables specifically for its
own purpose.”
</p>
<p>
Of course thermal batteries aren’t the only technology trying to solve
industrial heat emissions.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/concentrating-solar-department-of-energy" target="_blank">Concentrating
solar</a> thermal power systems can store the sun’s heat in molten
salts,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-occidental-direct-air-capture-data-progress" target="_blank">carbon
capture and storage</a> systems can pull the emissions from natural gas
combustion at the source, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_blank">green
hydrogen</a> can be combusted for heat delivery.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the same forces making thermal energy more attractive are also
benefiting green hydrogen in particular. Cheap renewables and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self">lucrative
hydrogen subsidies in the IRA</a> mean green hydrogen is also poised to
rapidly fall in price. But proponents of thermal batteries argue their
technology is much more efficient.
</p>
<p>
Electrical resistance heating (i.e. turning electricity into heat like a
toaster) is already a 100% efficient process. And after storing that
heat in rocks for hours or days, you still can get over 90% of it back
out. But producing green hydrogen through electrolysis and subsequently
combusting it for heat is only about 50-66% efficient overall, says
Nathan Iyer, a senior associate at the think tank RMI. That means green
hydrogen could require around 1.5 to two times the amount of renewable
electricity as thermal batteries to generate the same amount of heat.
</p>
<p>
“Pretty much all of the major models are saying thermal batteries are
winning when they run all of their optimizations,” Iyer said. “They’re
finding a huge chunk of industrial heat is unlocked by these thermal
batteries.”
</p>
<p>
However, when it comes to the most heat-intensive industries, such as
steel and cement production, combusting green hydrogen directly where
it’s needed could prove much easier than generating and transporting the
heat from thermal batteries. As Iyer told me, “At a certain level of
heat, the materials that can actually handle the heat and move the heat
around the facility are very, very rare.”
</p>
<p>
Iyer says these challenges begin around 600° or 700° Celsius. But the
lion’s share of industrial processes take place below this temperature
range, for use cases that thermal batteries appear well-equipped to
handle.
</p>
<p>
And now, the gigafactories are on their way. Rondo has partnered with
one of its investors, Thailand-based Siam Cement Group, to scale
production of its heat battery from 2.4 gigawatt-hours per year to 90
GWh per year, which will equal about 200-300 battery units. This
expanded facility would be the largest battery manufacturing plant in
the world today — about 2.5 times the size of Tesla’s Gigafactory in
Nevada.
</p>
<p>
Rondo, which has raised $82 million to date, says it can scale rapidly
because its tech is already so well understood. It relies on the same
type of refractory brick that’s found in Cowper stoves, a centuries old
technology used to recycle heat from blast furnaces.
</p>
<p>
In Rondo’s case, renewable electricity is used to heat the bricks
instead. Then, air is blown through the bricks and superheated to over
1,000° Celsius before being delivered to the end customer as either heat
through a short high-temperature duct or as steam through a standard
boiler tube.
</p>
<p>
“We’re using exactly the same heating element material that’s in your
toaster, exactly the same brick material that’s in all those steel
mills, exactly the same boiler design and boiler materials so that we
have as little to prove as possible,” O’Donnell says.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Rondo operates one small, 2 megawatt-hour commercial facility
at a Calgren ethanol plant in California. The company hopes to expand
its U.S. footprint, something the IRA will help catalyze.
<a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2023-27498.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Last
month’s guidelines</a> from the IRS clarify that thermal batteries are
eligible for a $45 per kilowatt-hour tax credit, which will help them
compete with cheap natural gas in the U.S.
</p>
<p>
Antora is already planning to produce batteries domestically, recently
launching its new manufacturing facility in San Jose, California. The
company has raised $80 million to date, and operates a pilot plant in
Fresno, California. Similar to Rondo, Antora’s tech relies on common
materials, in this case low-grade carbon blocks. “It’s an extremely
low-cost material. It’s produced at vast scales already,” says Briggs.
</p>

</p>
<p>
When heated with renewable electricity, these blocks emit an intense
glow. Much like the sun, that thermal glow can then be released as a
beam of 1,500° Celsius heat and light through a shutter on the box.
</p>
<p>
“And you can do one of two things with that beam of light. One, you can
let that deliver thermal energy to an industrial process,” says Briggs.
Or Antora’s specialized thermophotovoltaic panels can convert that hot
light back into electricity for a variety of end uses.
</p>
<p>
It’s all very promising, but ultimately unproven at scale, and the
companies wouldn’t disclose early customers or projects. But they have
some big names behind them. Both Antora and Rondo are backed by the Bill
Gates-funded Breakthrough Energy Ventures. Antora also receives funding
from Lowercarbon Capital, Shell Ventures, and BHP Ventures, indicating
that the oil, gas, petrochemical, and mining industries are taking note.
</p>
<p>
Along with funding from Energy Impact Partners, Rondo has a plethora of
industry backers too, including Siam Cement Group, TITAN Cement Group,
mining giant Rio Tinto, Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund, Saudi
chemicals company SABIC, and oil company Saudi Aramco.
</p>
<p>
“The investors that just joined us have giant needs,” O’Donnell says of
the company’s decision to massively ramp up manufacturing. “Rio Tinto
has announced 50% decarbonization by 2030. Microsoft is buying 24-hour
time-matched energy in all kinds of places. SABIC and Aramco have
enormous steam needs that they want to decarbonize.”
</p>
<p>
Primary uses of this tech will likely include chemical manufacturing,
mineral refining, food processing and paper and biofuel production.
Industries like these, which require heat below 1,000° Celsius (and
often much less),
<a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/shifts-to-decarbonize-industry#:~:text=The%20bigger%20challenge%20will%20be%20to%20electrify%20high%2Dtemperature%20heat%20processes%2C%20such%20as%20those%20used%20for%20cement%20production.%20About%C2%A032%25%20of%20industrial%20emissions%C2%A0are%20from%20generating%20heat%20above%201%2C000%20degrees%20Celsius%20(1%2C832%20degrees%20Fahrenheit)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">account
for 68% of all industrial emissions</a>. While steel and cement
production are two of industry’s biggest emitters, their heat needs can
exceed 1,500° Celsius, temperatures that Rondo and Antora admit are more
technically challenging to achieve.
</p>
<p>
In any case, 2024 is the year when hot rocks could start making a dent
in decarbonization. The IRA’s tax credits mean this emergent tech could
become competitive in more markets, beyond areas with excess renewable
power or substantial carbon taxes. This is the year that Antora says
they’ll begin mass production, and Rondo’s first commercial projects are
expected to come online.
</p>
<p>
As O’Donnell says, “This is not 10 years away. It’s not five years away.
It’s right now.”

S&amp;P Global Mobility released its latest round of US data on new EV
registrations for November 2023, and some surprising new trends are
popping up – with very modest gains by Tesla and Ford, compared to
bigger moves from smaller EV players Rivian and Kia, as well as luxury
EVs from Mercedes and BMW.

<h2 id="signed-commits">Signed commits</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Signed commits
</h1>
<p>
The <a href="https://blog.glyph.im/2024/01/unsigned-commits.html">post
on commit signing</a> by
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.social/@glyph" title="@glyph@mastodon.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="glyph">@glyph</span></a> reminds me of my
reluctance to electronically sign private emails. To me, signing
documents is a tool society uses against the people doing the signing.
It’s a liability I take upon myself in order to get something: a
wedding, a house – the other party is binding me to something.
Conversely, when I’m not getting something of value I’m not signing
anything. I prefer the liberty to repudiate everything. “I didn’t write
this.” I’m not promising anything.
</p>
<p>
Let’s go back to signed commits, however. When looking at it from the
point of view of a corporation, I feel that cryptographically signed
commits don’t help against bugs, malware, spies, or anything like that.
</p>
<p>
No, signed commits provide a different kind of security, if you can call
it that. The only leverage signed commits provide is that the
corporation can blame the person who signed the commit and inflict
consequences on them because it’s hard to deny that they did sign the
commit. Even if the corporation didn’t want to inflict consequences on
developers, it might have to abide by some certification process or
insurance-related policies that enables other corporations to go after
the developers.
</p>
<p>
It’s a bit like the security provided by cameras. They don’t help the
victim being filmed. They might help punish a perpetuator, maybe.
There’s no guarantee that this increases overall security.
</p>
<p>
In all cases, as a developer, these signed commits are against my
personal interest. Signing commits is a liability. It’s in the interest
of the employer, never in the interest of the employee.
</p>
<p>
As a user interested in code quality, I don’t really care who committed
the code. I’m interested in access control to the repository so that
only the people I trust merge code they deem to be correct. If this kind
of verification isn’t possible, then I’m starting to see a use case for
signed commits.
</p>
<p>
Assume that somebody sends me commits from a remote repository and I
can’t look at them for lack of time or lack of expertise. They claim to
be somebody I trust, like a contributor I know, or a co-worker, and I
need to decide whether to merge the commit. Now a signature for the
commit they’re trying to get me to add (and therefore all its ancestors)
might make sense.

SOAP was a tangle of specs, which must have made sense to someone, not

ActivityPub is today. I have no idea if the BDG helped, but it was the
only way I felt I could be supportive of the protocol, without saying it
was a complete failure. I was unusual in that among the developers of
the protocol, I was the only one who didn’t work at a big company, so if
I wanted to do something badly enough, I could just do it. The basic

On Thursday, House lawmakers will unveil a bipartisan bill that will
fund safe places to park for people who are living in their vehicles.
New Beginnings, a California nonprofit that pioneered the program, says
in addition to an influx of families with young children, senior
citizens make up half of their safe parking enrollees. We’ll also hear
about researchers using satellite radar data to assess the scale of
damage done by Israeli forces in Gaza.

<li>Report: Biden delaying approval of major LNG export terminal

<p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration has delayed approval of 17 new
facilities for the export of liquified natural gas (LNG), according to a
<em>New York Times

Officials are instead asking the Department of Energy to widen its
review of the first of these 17 — known as Calcasieu Pass 2, or CP2 — to
include effects on the global climate. <em>Heatmap</em> reached out to
the White House and got a “no comment” in response. Such a decision, if
confirmed, would be seen as a win for climate advocates who oppose the
terminals due to their potential environmental toll: At least one
analysis shows that, if all 17 export terminals were to be approved, the
emissions related to the fuel that would flow through them would exceed
the annual greenhouse gas emissions of the entire European Union. “Um, I
think we all just won,”

Bill McKibben, who is perhaps the project’s staunchest foe.<br/> <br/>
Republicans would likely oppose the decision, and some already accuse
President Biden of waging a war on affordable domestic energy. “What was
never in question is that this would be a major campaign issue, no
matter what Biden did,”

landscape: Demand for EVs is still growing but at a slower pace than
before, and competition is heating up at home and abroad. China’s BYD
overtook Tesla at the end of last year as the world’s top-selling EV
maker. During the earnings call, Musk took the opportunity to call for

Argentina recorded more than 12,500 cases last month and stores are
running out of bug spray. In Brazil, cases more than doubled in the
first week of January compared to last year. Hospitals in Paraguay have
set up night clinics to deal with a surge in patients. Dengue is often
asymptomatic but can cause terrible joint pain in some patients and more
than 35,000 people die from infections each year. “Climate change has
expanded the range for mosquitoes to breed,” explained Thais dos Santos
from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). A mass vaccination
program is underway in Brazil.

Delegation Affirms Bipartisan Support for Taiwan During Visit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TAIPEI, Taiwan — A bipartisan delegation from the U.S. Congress
reaffirmed support for Taiwan during a visit Thursday, following the
election of its new president. The delegation’s visit is the first from
U.S. lawmakers to the island since the independence-leaning Democratic
Progressive Party won a third-straight term in the January 13
presidential election.</p>
<p>China, America’s chief competitor for global influence, claims Taiwan
as its own territory and threatens to use force to bring the self-ruling
island under its control. Beijing strongly condemned Lai Ching-te’s
election and appears set to continue its policy of refusing to engage
with the island’s government — a practice that’s been in place since
Tsai Ing-wen’s election in 2016.</p>
<p>“The support of the United States for Taiwan is firm. It’s real, and
it is 100% bipartisan,” U.S. Representative Mario Díaz Balart said.</p>
<p>Balart, a Florida Republican, was joined by California Democrat Ami
Bera.</p>
<p>“In the 21st century, there’s no place for aggressive action. We have
to learn to live together, to trade together, to work together, to solve
problems together,” Bera said.</p>
<p>“Just know that we are proud of the people of Taiwan. We are proud of
the relationship and as strong as that relationship has always been.
That is assured. It will even be stronger,” Balart said.</p>
<p>“So, we look forward to working together to continue to protect the
peace, prosperity (and) the future of Taiwan. It’s up to people of
Taiwan,” Bera said.</p>
<p>President-elect Lai thanked the visiting co-chairs of the U.S.
Congressional Taiwan Caucus for their visit, saying that “today’s Taiwan
is a Taiwan of the world.”</p>
<p>“Moving forward, I will work with Vice President-elect Hsiao Bi-khim
to build upon the foundation laid by President Tsai to unite the people
of Taiwan, strengthen social resilience and continue to defend the
cross-strait status quo of peace and stability.”</p>
<p>The president-elect also touched on continued military assistance
from the U.S. and a proposed agreement to avoid mutual taxation of
companies.</p>
<p>Beijing objects to any form of official contact between the U.S. and
Taiwan. In 2022, it responded to a visit by then-House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi with some of its largest military maneuvers in years, including
missile launches and a simulated blockade of the island. It views visits
by foreign government officials as a recognition of the island’s
sovereignty.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden, seeking to calm that complaint, insists there’s
no change in America’s longstanding “One-China” policy, which recognizes
Beijing as representing China but allows informal relations and defense
ties with Taipei.</p>
<p>Washington cut formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979 in
order to recognize China, but U.S. law requires it to ensure the island
has the ability to defend itself. That has translated into a heavy
reliance on U.S. military hardware and a law saying that Washington must
treat threats against the island as a matter of “grave concern.”</p>
<p>China regularly sends warplanes and navy ships to intimidate and
harass Taiwan, with 18 planes and six ships operating near the island in
the 24 hours before 6 a.m. Thursday. Another three Chinese balloons were
recorded as crossing the island, although it remains unclear if they
have a military or intelligence gathering purpose.</p>

<h2 id="concerns-over-us-support-of-israel-hang-over-2024-poll">Concerns
Over US Support of Israel Hang Over 2024 Poll</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington/nashua, new hampshire — The burning conflict in Gaza has
lit a spark under untold numbers of American voters, and put extra heat
on U.S. President Joe Biden’s reelection bid. Protesters have
interrupted his recent campaign appearances to express their anger over
his support of Israel’s military campaign.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, protesters briefly disrupted a labor union event where
Biden was speaking. During a Tuesday rally focused on abortion access,
14 protesters shouted through most of Biden’s speech in Manassas,
Virginia. The interruptions clearly frustrated the president.</p>
<p>“This is going to go on for a while,” Biden said. “They have got this
planned.”</p>
<p>That protest was organized by Die-In For Humanity, a 700-member
strong protest group that has made nearly 100 appearances at Biden
events, the U.S. Capitol, outside administration members’ homes, outside
the Israeli Embassy, and at January’s protest in Washington.</p>
<p>“I think the majority of people are not OK with American tax dollars
being used to commit atrocities overseas,” Hazami Barmada, the group’s
lead organizer, told VOA. She was among the protesters escorted out of
Tuesday’s event.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing a shift in the tide in the United States with complete
rejection — in essence — of Biden,” said Barmada. “…what we’re saying is
that you’re not going to get the vote of the American community when you
constantly continue to disregard the voices of the Arab American
community that are saying stop the injustice and the atrocities in
Gaza.”</p>
<p>The White House said Wednesday the president supports Americans’
right to peacefully protest.</p>
<p>“He also believes it’s really important that Israel have the right
and the ability to continue to defend themselves against — which is …
what is clearly still a viable threat from Hamas,” said John Kirby,
strategic communications coordinator for the National Security
Council.</p>
<p>“But that doesn’t mean we’re going to stop, again, urging a stronger
focus by our Israeli counterparts on minimizing civilian casualties and
on getting aid in,” Kirby said.</p>
<p>Foreign policy, political analysts say, rarely drives elections but
can make a difference when the competition is tight. Like for undecided
New Hampshire voter Isaac Geer, who participated Tuesday in a primary
vote that Biden and Republican contender Donald Trump won for their
respective parties.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing I’m voting for this election season is foreign
policy,” he told VOA, speaking in Nashua, New Hampshire. “It’s really
important to me that we stay out of any foreign wars and keep our
military spending down, and bring our troops back home or keep them
home.”</p>
<p>Trump’s plan to resolve the Gaza crisis is unclear, and his previous
actions as president included a much-criticized “ban” of Muslim
immigrants. VOA reached out several times to the Trump campaign, but
they did not respond.</p>
<p>For Muslim activists, it’s a stark choice. Hassan Abdel Salam is a
Minneapolis-based professor who co-founded the Abandon Biden movement of
Muslim voters, which focuses on swing states. He is a Canadian
citizen.</p>
<p>“Mr. Trump prevented our friends and colleagues and family from
entering the country,” he told VOA. “But Mr. Biden killed them. And that
four years under any Republican is incomparable to one day in Gaza, that
an argument has emerged within our communities, that we have to
sacrifice.”</p>
<p>Political analysts say Biden is in a difficult position.</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt that the situation in Gaza is a political problem
for Biden,” Norm Ornstein, a senior fellow emeritus at the American
Enterprise Institute, told VOA. “If you step back and look objectively,
Biden has handled this issue adroitly about as well as any president
could. He understood early on that by hugging [Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin] Netanyahu close, he could keep some of the worst things from
happening in Gaza. But he’s now getting very close to pushing Bibi
aside. And that means that the initial move — which alienated a lot of
voters, not just Arab American voters, but young progressives — may in
fact end up being worse for him, because if he pushes or spurns Bibi
Netanyahu aside, then some of his strongest supporters, pro-Israel
supporters, may be unhappy as well.”</p>

is to entering beta! It looks like they just need to add a way to create
an account through the web interface (rather than the server admin
having to create accounts manually), and add support for the ActivityPub
<code>Move</code> activity (so you can migrate your account from, say,
Mastodon). There’s other stuff they want to add after that, but nothing
that would hold back “beta” status.
</p>
<p>
I can’t really see myself migrating my main Fedi account to GoToSocial
in the near future, but I <em>could</em> see myself trying it out for my
auxlangs or “political toots” accounts. Hopefully some more parties will
get on board with offering managed GoToSocial hosting once it’s in beta,
though, because working out how to deploy it and put it behind a
reverse-proxy and whatnot might be a liiiiiittle beyond me 🙃

<h2 id="chinas-foreign-visitor-numbers-slow-to-recover">China’s Foreign
Visitor Numbers Slow to Recover</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Austin, Texas — As China tries to show itself as welcoming foreign
trade and tourism, its border authorities announced last week that the
country had more than 35 million entries and exits by foreign nationals
in 2023.</p>
<p>That was nearly seven times more than 2022, when Beijing’s draconian
Zero-COVID policy was still in effect and visitors stayed away.  </p>
<p>Still, the 2023 figure is around a third of the 97 million foreigner
border crossings that were recorded in 2019 before the pandemic.  </p>
<p>Experts and visa applicants say concerns about personal freedom are
discouraging visitors, despite Beijing’s loosening visa requirements.
 </p>
<p>China’s embassy in the United States announced in late December that
from January it would relax visa applications for U.S. citizens, no
longer requiring them to submit detailed materials such as round-trip
flight tickets, hotel reservations, itineraries, or invitation letters.
 </p>
<p>That is a welcome change for some Americans, like one recent graduate
who tells VOA he has a long, complicated trip that he hopes to start in
China and end in Southeast Asia. </p>
<p>“I want to stay in Beijing for a while first, visit China’s ancient
sites, and then go all the way south to Yunnan (Province), and then
continue south to visit Laos and other Southeast Asian countries,” said
the graduate, who asked to be called Michael to avoid the attention of
Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>But Michael said he’s reluctant to go through with the China leg,
despite it being the country he wants to visit most, because he fears
his personal freedom could be at risk – even as a tourist. </p>
<p>“I saw the State Department updated their travel advisory to
‘reconsider travel.’ I am not sure if I should plan to visit China, or
maybe I can go but should take a few precautions.”  </p>
<p>In June of last year, the U.S. State Department re-issued its level 3
travel alert on China with an update to reconsider travel there due to
the “risk of wrongful detentions.”  It also contained language on
previous alerts to reconsider travel based on the risk of “arbitrary
enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans.” </p>
<p>Such concern is part of the challenge Beijing faces as it tries to
present a positive image of the country as welcoming to traders and
visitors.</p>
<p>The relaxed rules for Americans came just a month after China
announced a visa-free policy from December for ordinary passport holders
from six countries — France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Malaysia, and
Spain.</p>
<p>China’s National Immigration Administration says the number of
visitors from those countries was 28.5% higher in December than in the
previous month. Beijing last week added Switzerland and Ireland to the
visa-free policy.  </p>
<p>China’s Civil Aviation Administration this month said it aims to
boost direct flights between China and the U.S. from the current 63
flights per week.  It had in November set a goal of reaching 70 flights
per week to boost tourism and trade. </p>
<p>While it’s not yet clear whether the increased flights and loosened
visa restrictions have boosted the number of Americans visiting China,
those VOA spoke to who plan or regularly visit China expressed concerns
about the worsening risks.  </p>
<p>A Chinese-American from Houston, Texas, who works in international
trade and travels to China five to six times per year, told VOA that
while the requirements for tourist visa applications have been relaxed,
since last year he noticed Chinese customs officers ask arriving
visitors more questions than in the past.  He asked to use the pseudonym
“Mr. Li” in order to speak more freely with VOA about the issue.  </p>
<p>“One difference is that China now [tacitly implies] that every
foreigner, including every foreign Chinese, is a spy,” he said.</p>
<p>Last July, a revised version of China’s counter-espionage law went
into effect raising fears of more arbitrary arrests. That has made
Americans more concerned about traveling to China and Chinese citizens
more wary of foreigners. </p>
<p>Zev Faintuch, a senior intelligence analyst with Global Guardian - a
risk assessment firm that works with multinational companies - says
there is still plenty of interest in going to China. </p>
<p>But, he adds, “because of that law, it’s legally much easier to
detain foreigners as a result.” </p>
<p>Faintuch says he’s seen an increase in businesses wanting to assess
the overall situation in China but is not optimistic conditions will
improve.</p>
<p>“At least from where we are sitting, what we’re telling our clients,
our message here is, we believe that the window for doing business in
China is closing for Western companies,” he said.</p>
<p>Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on
Foreign Relations, told VOA that visitors should take that into
consideration before planning to go to China.  </p>
<p>“The release of the counter-espionage law encourages Chinese citizens
to report to the government the people who they consider are like the
FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation),” Huang said, adding that the
approach treats “potential visitors like they are not that welcome.”</p>

id="nevada-judge-approves-signature-gathering-stage-for-petition-to-put-abortion-rights-on-2024-ballot">Nevada
Judge Approves Signature-Gathering Stage for Petition to Put Abortion
Rights on 2024 Ballot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>RENO, Nevada — A Nevada judge has approved a petition by abortion
access advocates as eligible for signature gathering in their
long-standing attempt to get abortion rights on the 2024 ballot.</p>
<p>Carson City District Judge James T. Russell made the ruling Tuesday,
about two months after he struck down a similar yet broader version
that, if passed, would have enshrined additional reproductive rights
into the state’s constitution.</p>
<p>If the Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom political action committee
gets enough signatures, a question would appear on the November ballot
that would enshrine abortion access for up to 24 weeks, or as needed to
protect the health of the pregnant patient, into the Nevada
Constitution.  Then, voters would need to approve it again on the 2026
ballot to amend the constitution.</p>
<p>Abortion rights up to 24 weeks are already codified into Nevada law
through a 1990 referendum, where two-thirds of voters were in favor.
That could be changed with another referendum.</p>
<p>The standards are higher for amending the constitution, which
requires either approval from two legislative sessions and an election,
or two consecutive elections with a simple majority of votes.</p>
<p>The petition that was cleared for signatures is one of two efforts
from the Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom committee to get the right to
abortion on the 2024 ballot.</p>
<p>Russell rejected an earlier petition in a November ruling, saying the
proposed ballot initiative was too broad, contained a “misleading
description of effect” and had an unfunded mandate.</p>
<p>The petition would have included protections for “matters relating to
their pregnancies” including prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care,
birth control, vasectomies, tubal ligations, abortion and abortion care,
as well as care for miscarriages and infertility. Nevadans for
Reproductive Freedom appealed that rejection to the Nevada Supreme Court
and are waiting for a new ruling.</p>
<p>The petition approved for signatures Tuesday had narrower language —
“establishing a fundamental, individual right to abortion,” which
applies to “decisions about matters relating to abortion” without
government interference.</p>
<p>In a statement following the ruling, Nevadans for Reproductive
Freedom spokesperson Lindsey Harmon celebrated the ruling but said she
remained confident that the committee’s initial petition would be
recognized as eligible by the Nevada Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“Abortion rights are not the only form of reproductive freedom under
attack across the country,” Harmon said. “Protecting miscarriage
management, birth control, prenatal and postpartum care, and other vital
reproductive health care services are inextricably linked pieces of a
singular right to reproductive freedom.”</p>
<p>Abortion rights have become a mobilizing issue for Democrats since
the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 court
decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion.</p>
<p>Constitutional amendments protecting abortion access are already set
to appear on the 2024 ballot in New York and Maryland and could also
show up in a host of states, including Missouri and Arizona.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Nevada’s Democratic-controlled Legislature are also
attempting to get reproductive rights including abortion access in front
of voters on the 2026 ballot. The initiative, which would enshrine those
rights in the state constitution, passed the state Senate and Assembly
in May 2023 and now must be approved with a simple majority again in
2025 before being eligible for the 2026 ballot.</p>

id="analysts-us-south-korea-should-be-ready-for-russia-north-korea-alliance">Analysts:
US, South Korea Should Be Ready for Russia-North Korea Alliance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Depending on what kinds of weapons technology Moscow
transfers to Pyongyang, the United States and South Korea may need to
update their measures for dealing with North Korean threats, said
analysts.  </p>
<p>John Kirby, White House National Security Council spokesman, said the
U.S. is watching “very closely” as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un
pursues advanced military capabilities from Russian President Vladimir
Putin.</p>
<p>Kirby said at a press briefing on Tuesday that Kim’s ability to
benefit from this relationship is concerning, but the U.S. and South
Korean defensive posture on the Korean Peninsula “is appropriate to the
risk.”</p>
<p>Since July, when Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu visited North
Korea, Pyongyang has been deepening its military ties with Moscow while
escalating threats on the peninsula and calling for preparations to
occupy South Korea if war breaks out.</p>
<p>North Korea fired cruise missiles into the waters off its western
coast on Wednesday, according to South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. It
also began taking down a monument in Pyongyang symbolizing reunification
with South Korea.</p>
<p>Putin and North Korean Ambassador Choe Son Hui discussed bilateral
relations in Moscow on January 16, according to Tass, the Russian
state-owned news agency. It quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov
the next day saying Moscow and Pyongyang “intend to boost relations in
all areas, including sensitive ones.”</p>
<p>The most worrisome technology North Korea could seek from Russia
would enable Pyongyang to miniaturize nuclear warheads to fit into a
ballistic missile cone, survive reentry and hit targets in South Korea,
Japan and North America, said Robert Peters, a fellow for nuclear
deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>“This technology is the last and the most critical step in North
Korea fielding a credible nuclear strike capability and is well within
Russia’s ability to share,” Peters told VOA via email.</p>
<p>He continued, “South Korea and the United States should prepare to
face a North Korea that is technically more capable than it has been
before.”</p>
<p>At an event in Washington hosted by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies on January 18, Pranay Vaddi, the National Security
Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, warned
that the North Korean threat “could drastically change over the coming
decade” as a result of military cooperation with Moscow.</p>
<p>“What we are seeing between Russia and North Korea is an
unprecedented level of cooperation in the military sphere,” Vaddi
said.</p>
<p>Last year, Putin turned to North Korea to replenish Russia’s weapons
stockpile, which has been drawn down severely since the invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022. He met with Kim in Russia in September to
discuss possible arms dealings.</p>
<p>In October, Washington released satellite photos showing North Korea
shipping more than 1,000 containers of weapons to Russia in violation of
sanctions.</p>
<p>Artillery and missiles North Korea provided to Russia have been
turning up in Ukraine, The New York Times reported on Monday.</p>
<p>John Erath, senior policy director for the Center for Arms Control
and Non-Proliferation, said Russian technology transfers “would not so
much change the threat as add to the atmosphere of tension on the
peninsula.”</p>
<p>But he told VOA via email, “It will be important to keep defense and
deterrence arrangements updated.”</p>
<p>In November, the U.S. and South Korea held an annual Security
Consultative Meeting in Seoul, where they announced the revision of the
2013 Tailored Deterrence Strategy “in recognition of the changing
security environment.</p>
<p>Their meeting followed a summit that U.S. President Joe Biden and
South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held in April in Washington, where
they announced the Washington Declaration aimed at strengthening nuclear
deterrence on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Gary Samore, White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of
mass destruction during the Obama administration, said in a telephone
interview that weapons technology Pyongyang could obtain from Moscow
could embolden it to raise threats but would not be a game changer
requiring the revision of “fundamental deterrence” on the Korean
Peninsula.</p>
<p>Samore, a professor at Brandeis University, thinks Pyongyang could
seek enhanced technology to include surface-to-air missiles, spy
satellite collection capabilities and advanced military fighter
aircraft.</p>
<p>He told VOA that although Moscow would be “happy whenever there is
trouble for the U.S.,” it would not encourage Pyongyang to cause
conflict on the Korean Peninsula that would “jeopardize the flow of
weapons to Russia” for its war in Ukraine.</p>

Woman Who Lost Lawsuit to Get Abortion to Attend Biden’s State of the
Union</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-25, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden have
extended an invitation to attend the president’s State of the Union
address to a Texas woman who sued her state and lost over the ability to
get an abortion.</p>
<p>The Texas Supreme Court denied Kate Cox’s request. But by then, her
lawyers said, she had already traveled out of state for an abortion.</p>
<p>The Bidens spoke with Cox on Sunday and invited her to the annual
address set for March 7 at the U.S. Capitol. Cox will sit with the first
lady, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday. Cox
accepted the invite, she said.</p>
<p>“They thanked her for her courage in sharing her story and speaking
out against the impact of the extreme abortion ban in Texas,”
Jean-Pierre said.</p>
<p>Cox, 31, was pregnant with her third child when she learned the fetus
had a rare genetic disorder. The couple was informed by doctors that
their baby would live at best a week. She sued over the right to have an
abortion to end the pregnancy but lost because the judges said she
hadn’t shown her life was in danger enough to be granted the
procedure.</p>
<p>The White House invitation reflects how strongly the administration
is leaning into reproductive rights as a galvanizing force for voters in
the upcoming presidential election after the Supreme Court in 2022
overturned abortion protections. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris
and their spouses on Tuesday centered their first major campaign rally
of the election year on abortion rights.</p>
<p>In his speech, Biden spoke about the increased medical challenges
women are facing since the fall of Roe v. Wade, particularly for women
who never intended to end their pregnancies. He laid the blame on
Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, who as president appointed three
conservative justices to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>This will be the first State of the Union under Republican House
Speaker Mike Johnson, who will sit behind the president and to his left
during the address to Congress. This year’s speech will offer an
opportunity for Biden to detail his broader vision and policy priorities
as he campaigns for reelection in November.</p>
