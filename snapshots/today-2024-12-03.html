<p>
The GHC developers are happy to announce the availability of GHC 9.8.4.
Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation are
available on the
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_9_8_4.html">release</a>
page.
</p>
<p>
This release is a small release fixing a few issues noted in 9.8.3,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Update the <code>filepath</code> submodule to avoid a misbehavior of
<code>splitFileName</code> under Windows.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Update the <code>unix</code> submodule to fix a compilation issue on
<code>musl</code> platforms
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix a potential source of miscompilation when building large projects on
32-bit platforms
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Fix unsound optimisation of <code>prompt#</code> uses
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A full accounting of changes can be found in the
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/9.8.4/docs/users_guide/9.8.4-notes.html">release
notes</a>. As some of the fixed issues do affect correctness users are
encouraged to upgrade promptly.
</p>
<p>
We would like to thank Microsoft Azure, GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake
pool, Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.
</p>
<p>
As always, do give this release a try and open a
<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if
you see anything amiss.
</p>
<p>
Happy compiling!
