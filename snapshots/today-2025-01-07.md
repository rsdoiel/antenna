## Five years after Alienware UFO concept, Dell still isn’t ready to launch a handheld gaming PC

<p>The UnifyDrive UP6 is a portable computer that&#8217;s also a network-attached storage device. Or maybe it&#8217;s a NAS that&#8217;s also a portable computer.

## The future of htmx

date: 2025-01-06, updated: 2025-01-06, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://htmx.org/essays/future/">The future of htmx</a></strong></p>
Carson Gross and Alex Petros lay out an ambitious plan for <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>: stay stable, add few features and try to earn the same reputation for longevity that jQuery has (estimated to be used on <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library">75.3% of websites</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In particular, we want to emulate these technical characteristics of jQuery that make it such a low-cost, high-value addition to the toolkits of web developers. Alex has discussed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lASLZ9TgXyc">"Building The 100 Year Web Service"</a> and we want htmx to be a useful tool for exactly that use case.</p>
<p>Websites that are built with jQuery stay online for a very long time, and websites built with htmx should be capable of the same (or better).</p>
<p>Going forward, htmx will be developed with its <em>existing</em> users in mind. [...]</p>
<p>People shouldn’t feel pressure to upgrade htmx over time unless there are specific bugs that they want fixed, and they should feel comfortable that the htmx that they write in 2025 will look very similar to htmx they write in 2035 and beyond.</p>

## AI’s next leap requires intimate access to your digital life

date: 2025-01-06, updated: 2025-01-06, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/05/agents-ai-chatbots-google-mariner/">AI’s next leap requires intimate access to your digital life</a></strong></p>
I'm quoted in this Washington Post story by Gerrit De Vynck about "agents" - which in this case are defined as AI systems that operate a computer system like a human might, for example <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/22/computer-use/">Anthropic's Computer Use demo</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The problem is that language models as a technology are inherently gullible,” said Simon Willison, a software developer who has tested many AI tools, including Anthropic’s technology for agents. “How do you unleash that on regular human beings without enormous problems coming up?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got the closing quote too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you ignore the safety and security and privacy side of things, this stuff is so exciting, the potential is amazing,” Willison said. “I just don’t see how we get past these problems.”</p>
</blockquote>
