<h2 id="enough-space-for-everyone-us-china-target-africa">Enough Space for Everyone? US, China Target Africa</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Johannesburg, south africa — As a new space race between the United States and China takes off, Africa is increasingly an arena for competition between the two superpowers. And so far, analysts say, China is ahead.  </p>
<p>While Africa’s space agencies are still in their infancy compared to those of the U.S. and China, analysts say space has become a new frontier for diplomacy with African countries. </p>
<p>“In recent years, China has emerged as the leading partner with Africa,” said Nigerian space scientist Temidayo Oniosun, who is the founder of Space in Africa, an analytics and consulting company.  </p>
<p>Oniosun says there have been a lot of collaborations across sectors including communications, observation, navigation and positioning. China is developing satellites for different partners, ground station infrastructure, and is pushing for countries to adopt its BeiDou satellite navigation system, seen as an alternative to America’s GPS. </p>
<p>“Chinese companies have been capitalizing on this for years. It’s now that the U.S. is waking up to this,” he said during a recent forum on the topic at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington or USIP, a think tank founded by Congress.  </p>
<p>“U.S. strategy towards Africa in space is actually more about reducing the hegemony of China over Africa than anything else. … I think one of the major reasons they’re [the U.S.] paying attention is because China is doing so much,” Oniosun told VOA.  </p>
<p>Asked whether the U.S. was indeed playing catch-up, a National Security Council spokesperson did not comment on Chinese competition directly, but said in that “U.S. companies are at the forefront” of working with Africa.  </p>
<p>The spokesperson detailed some of the agreements on space announced at last year’s U.S.-Africa Leaders’ Summit, including Nigeria’s partnership with U.S. firm SpaceX, which also helped Kenya launch its first operational earth satellite in April.</p>
<p>China regards Space X as competition</p>
<p>China sees Elon Musk’s company as a major rival to its ambition to become a dominant space power by 2045. </p>
<p>Asked whether China was ahead when it came to space cooperation with Africa, a NASA spokesperson told VOA: “The United States continues to work internationally for a safe, peaceful, and prosperous future in space. Working with both new and existing partners will add new energy and capabilities to help ensure the entire world can benefit from our journey of exploration and discovery.”</p>
<p>As one example of cooperation with Africa, the NASA spokesperson pointed to the U.S. agency’s current collaboration with the South African National Space Agency (SANSA) on plans to build a new tracking and communications antenna site near Matjiesfontein, in the country’s semi-desert area of Karoo. </p>
<p>“NASA is currently finalizing negotiations for an agreement for NASA to build an 18-meter Lunar Exploration Ground Sites antenna to support the Artemis Program and the human lunar return to the moon,” the spokesperson said. </p>
<p>U.S. led Artemis Accords is described as a “set of principles designed to guide civil space exploration and use in the 21st century.” Other African countries have also been signing onto NASA’s Artemis Accords, including Angola whose president signed the accords on November 30, during a visit to the White House. </p>
<p>View from Africa  </p>
<p>According to a USIP report, co-authored by Oniosun, there are currently space programs in more than 20 African countries, and Africa accounted for 0.7 percent of global space expenditure in 2020. </p>
<p>Rather than seeking to participate in deep space exploration or human spaceflight, the report says many African countries see space development as a way of achieving national development goals and space-linked infrastructure as an important way to address problems such as climate change, national disaster preparedness and counter-terrorism.   </p>
<p>A list sent to VOA by the South African National Space Agency, mentioned 11 partnerships with the U.S., including on deep space exploration, space education, space science research, hosting of Global Navigation Satellite System equipment, and six standing agreements relating to space operations.  </p>
<p>“SANSA also has long-standing working relationships with USA and Canadian researchers in space weather,” Asanda Sangoni, acting managing director of SANSA Earth Observation, told VOA in a written response. </p>
<p>The agency has three projects or agreements with China on space exploration, satellite navigation, and general space cooperation, according to Sangoni. </p>
<p>Asked whether Africa is becoming one of the areas of competition in a new Cold War space race, Sangoni wrote: “There is no single”Space Race" (if there is any) in the traditional sense." </p>
<p>“The global space landscape is evolving, with an increasing number of nations, including emerging nations, participating and often partnering in space activities. These nations pursue various goals and objectives based on their unique circumstances and interests, contributing to the overall development of space exploration and utilization,” Sangoni wrote. </p>
<p>“SANSA strongly believes that space-related activities should be inclusive and beneficial for all mankind. SANSA promotes the peaceful use of space and respectful cooperation,” she added. </p>
<p>National Security Concern? </p>
<p>During the U.S. Institute of Peace panel, Joseph Sany, the vice president of the Africa Center, explained some of the perceived risks that are fueling the new space race. </p>
<p>“As great powers vie for dominance in space, the risk of conflict between them looms large,” he said. “In an environment where space assets are essential for intelligence gathering, communication and military operation, disparities in capabilities could heighten tensions and create an atmosphere conducive to conflict.” </p>
<p>“As competition intensifies, the trust and willingness to cooperate may diminish” Sany said. “Misunderstandings, miscommunications or deliberate disruptions in communication systems could easily escalate into full-blown conflict.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s 2023 annual report to Congress on China’s military developments makes numerous references to Beijing’s ambitions in space.  </p>
<p>The People’s Liberation Army “views space superiority, the ability to control the space-enabled information sphere and to deny adversaries their own space-based information gathering and communication capabilities, as critical components to conduct modern ‘informatized warfare’,” the report states.  </p>
<p>“The PLA continues to acquire and develop a range of counter-space capabilities and related technologies, including kinetic-kill missiles, ground-based lasers, and orbiting space robots, as well as expanding space surveillance capabilities, which can monitor objects in space within their field of view and enable counter space actions,” according to the report. </p>
<p>It’s not just Africa where China’s space industry footprint is expanding. A recent article in The Washington Post said the Pentagon is concerned that some of China’s space and satellite programs in Latin America having defense capabilities.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred VOA’s questions on its space cooperation with Africa to the Chinese Mission to the African Union, which did not reply to requests for comment.</p>

<h2 id="victims-in-oregon-small-plane-crash-were-resettled-afghan-refugees">Victims in Oregon Small Plane Crash Were Resettled Afghan Refugees</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Oregon — Three men who died in a small plane crash in Oregon were Afghan air force pilots who fought with the American military and came to the U.S. as refugees after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in 2021, according to groups that helped with their resettlement. </p>
<p>Salem for Refugees said it resettled Mohammad Hussain Musawi, 35, Mohammad Bashir Safdari, 35, and Ali Jan Ferdawsi, 29, in the Salem area last spring. The nonprofit provides financial aid to newly arrived refugees and helps them find housing and employment, among other support services. It said it was devastated by their deaths. </p>
<p>“In 2022, they sought refuge and new beginnings in Oregon, where their kindness, skills, and determination quickly touched the lives of those around them,” the group said on a GoFundMe page it created to help cover funeral expenses and support the pilots’ families. </p>
<p>The men lost their lives Saturday when a small plane that was piloted by Musawi and carrying Safdari and Ferdawsi as its only passengers crashed into power lines near Independence, a small city in the Willamette Valley about 12 miles (19 kilometers) southwest of Salem. </p>
<p>Darwaish Zakhil, co-founder and community advancement director of Afghan Support Network, a nonprofit based in Portland, described Musawi as committed and ambitious. He had spoken on the phone with him and met him in person, he said, and had also met Safdari and Ferdawsi at events. </p>
<p>They were all working toward their commercial pilot licenses and wanted to be reunited with their families. </p>
<p>“They were happy. They were hopeful for the future,” he said. “When you look back and see their work and their life, what they’ve been through, it’s so sad for all Afghans around the globe and especially here in the state of Oregon.” </p>
<p>Darin Chung, co-founder of the Afghan American Development group, a nonprofit that helps some 600 former Afghan military aviation personnel in the U.S. with refugee resettlement, job training and family reunification, said he also met Musawi — at the aviation hangar in Independence this past spring. Chung, who was a U.S. Marines pilot for 20 years and served in Afghanistan, described him as “terrifically respectful.” </p>
<p>“As a veteran myself, who spent time in combat, I consider these guys every bit of veteran as a U.S. citizen who spent time in the U.S. military in combat,” he said. </p>
<p>“They’re incredible people,” he said of the Afghans his nonprofit assists. “They have been under more stress than I ever have experienced.” </p>
<p>The pilots’ families have remained in Afghanistan while waiting to be able to come to the U.S., according to the group, which has also created a GoFundMe page. The men hadn’t seen their families since August 2021, when the Taliban swept back to power after seizing the Afghan capital Kabul. </p>
<p>As the Taliban advanced on Kabul, the pilots were among those who flew their aircraft, under fire, to the neighboring country of Tajikistan to prevent air force equipment from falling into the hands of the group’s fighters, said Russ Pritchard, the nonprofit’s CEO. </p>
<p>They came to the U.S. as part of Operation Allies Welcome, Pritchard said. The program has helped resettle at least 90,000 Afghans since 2021, including those who worked for the U.S. government and military, according to the U.S. State Department. </p>
<p>“All three of those men were heroes, fought side by side with their American counterparts, participated in one last heroic act and were granted asylum,” Pritchard said. “They all dreamed of their children coming and being educated in the United States.” </p>
<p>Pritchard said most of the people that his group helps have been separated from their families for more than two years. </p>
<p>The small plane carrying Musawi, Safdari and Ferdawsi was traveling in heavy fog Saturday from McMinnville, Oregon, to the Independence State Airport, police said. </p>
<p>Authorities said the initial investigation found the collision with electrical power lines resulted in a small brush fire and a power outage in the community. </p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating with assistance from Independence police. A possible cause was not immediately released. </p>
<p>The nonprofits working to support the pilots’ families said the Afghan community was grieving the loss. Some 1,400 Afghans have resettled as refugees in Oregon since 2021, according to the state’s department of human services. </p>
<p>“These heroes will be deeply missed,” Salem for Refugees said. “Let’s unite in their honor and give their families the support they need during this unimaginable time.”</p>

Growing up, I begrudgingly attended the annual Father’s Day car show on our local Main Street. My dad liked to spend the morning ogling muscle cars and chatting up their often tattooed or bearded owners. I tried my best to feign interest, but as much as I love my dad, I just couldn’t get excited about cars. I don’t think he passed along the “car guy” gene to me.
</p>
<p>
At least that’s what I thought until about a month ago. I’m now the proud new owner of a (used) 2020 Chevy Bolt Premier, and I’m ready to talk about it with anyone willing to listen.

<p>
There is a dearth of options for a small, affordable electric vehicle. The Chevy Bolt is one of the very few cars that meets that criteria today.
</p>
<p>
So what’s to like about the Bolt?
</p>
<p>
First off, it’s a blast to drive. Its small size and zippy acceleration makes me feel like I’m in the driver’s seat of my childhood remote control car. It never feels too small, however. We comfortably fit our family of four, including two carseats, and the hatchback and spacious trunk provide ample cargo space.
</p>
<p>
The Premier trim also comes with what to me — whose last primary vehicle was a 2006 Civic — feel like luxury features: a 360 camera (that makes parking this small car that much easier), a heated steering wheel, wireless phone charging, and a Bose sound system.
</p>
<p>
It also has impressive range for a car its size. On a full charge, the Chevy Bolt can travel an estimated 259 miles. That’s 100 miles more than another small and affordable EV, the Nissan Leaf.

But most importantly the Bolt is an insanely good deal — maybe one of the best car deals of all time, particularly if you buy one used and live in a state that has additional used EV incentives.
</p>
<p>
And you probably will have to. Early in 2023, GM curiously (a nice way to put it) decided to discontinue the Bolt, though they more recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/24/general-motors-chevrolet-bolt-ev-ultium.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reversed that decision</a> thanks to growing demand. However, there will be no 2024 model. As such, it’s easier today to find a used Bolt than a new one.
</p>
<p>
You can easily find a used Bolt for under $20,000. Pair that with a federal $4,000 used <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EV tax credit</a>, and in some cases a state rebate (Massachusetts, where I live, offers a $3,500 used-EV rebate for certain income thresholds), and you just got yourself a steal of a deal.
</p>
<p>
For instance, suppose you don’t opt for the “luxurious” Premier level trim and give up that heated steering wheel. Using Autotrader.com, I found a used 2020 Bolt EV on sale in Massachusetts with just 9,900 miles. It’s listed at $17,795. Add on sales tax and some other fees, and now you’re looking at $19,500, give or take. However, that’s before the incentives kick in.
</p>

<img alt="Screenshot of Autotrader.com." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="8c8efa2219fdddd115dc05ea34926d8a" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="df338" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDkxMDU4My9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxOTc1NTMwNX0.LLffMdnetZlze6tMq5McJQxCGF6vFS0rR8jfuDA9zkQ/image.png?width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Screenshot of Autotrader.com.</small>
</p>
<p>
Subtract the combined federal and Massachusetts used EV incentives of $7,500, however, and this (hardly) used EV now only cost you $12,000.
</p>
<p>
By comparison, I used the same site to see what other non-electric 2020 vehicles I could buy for $12,000, and I came up with less than 10 results within a 100 mile radius. All but one had 100,000 miles or more. The only comparable vehicle was a 2020 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 SE with 36,400 miles. And really, there is no comparison. On the fun factor alone, the Bolt can accelerate from 0-60 in 6.5 seconds, while the Mirage takes nearly twice as long at 13 seconds.
</p>
<p>
If you’re thinking about buying a Bolt (or any EV, really), there is more good news. Beginning in 2024, many dealerships will even offer the federal credit at <a href="https://apnews.com/article/electric-vehicle-tax-credit-point-of-sale-new-used-670990726b378ba972fc038471fb29eb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">point of sale</a> instead of having to wait until tax season.
</p>
<p>
Another pro-tip for potential buyers: due to a recall, it’s possible to find a used Bolt that has recently received a brand new battery which resets the 8 year/100,000 mile battery warranty to its installation date. Many Bolts have just received a <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/06/14/bolt-battery-recall-diagnostics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">software update </a>instead, but you can ask your local dealer to keep an eye out for one with a new battery.
</p>
<p>
Now, the Bolt isn’t perfect.
</p>
<p>
Even though its range is great, it is one of the <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/g46011090/fastest-slowest-ev-charging-times-tested/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slowest charging</a> electric vehicles out there. Even for Bolt models with high speed DC fast charging, it takes about 30 minutes to charge 100 miles, compared to 10 minutes for the Hyundai Ioniq 6.
</p>
<p>
But if you’re like the average American that drives <a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/average-miles-driven-per-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">37 miles a day</a>, and you have somewhere at home to plug into, the relatively slow fast charging speed doesn’t have to be a deal breaker. My family has so far gotten away with almost exclusively trickle charging our Bolt at home using a standard 120 volt outlet which yields us about 4 miles per hour charged.
</p>
<p>
We’ve even managed to find some free level 2 chargers (about 39 miles per hour charged) in neighboring towns. Imagine just rolling up to a gas station and getting a couple of free gallons for your tank with no strings attached. We basically found that, but with fewer emissions.
</p>
<p>
If you’re on the fence about a Bolt, don’t just take it from me, someone who couldn’t care less about cars until last month. Tom McParland, an automotive consultant and contributor at Jalopnik, wrote a <a href="https://jalopnik.com/used-chevy-bolt-might-be-the-best-20-000-commuter-car-1850774000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similar screed</a> this past summer.
</p>
<p>
Given used car prices have been falling across the board in the last few months, I called McParland to see if his recommendation of buying a used Bolt still stands.
</p>
<p>
I just had to get one qualification out of the way to start my interview. “Do you consider yourself a car guy?,” I asked the automotive consultant that has written <a href="https://muckrack.com/tom-mcparland" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over 1,600 articles</a> about cars.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” he replied and said no more on the topic. Car guy confirmed.
</p>
<p>
“Overall, my thesis still remains,” he said. “Right now the Bolt doesn’t have a lot of other competitors that match it for range, recency, and the other key thing here is remaining warranty balance.”
</p>
<p>
In his article, McParland concludes, “used Bolts should get most folks where they need to go and offer a ton of savings.”
</p>
<p>
I can’t wait to take the Bolt 100 miles south to my parent’s house for the holidays and answer all of my dad’s questions about the car while he takes it for a test drive.

<h2 id="pacific-storm-that-unleashed-flooding-now-barreling-down-on-southeastern-california">Pacific Storm That Unleashed Flooding Now Barreling Down on Southeastern California</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA BARBARA, California — A Pacific storm that pounded California’s coastal areas and stranded motorists was poised to pounce on the southeastern area of the state through Friday, bringing flood threats to a sweeping area extending from San Diego into the Mojave Desert and even into parts of Arizona. </p>
<p>As millions of Californians scrambled to finish their holiday shopping or prepared to head out onto highways, the National Weather Service issued flood watches for low-lying urban areas and the deserts. </p>
<p>Showers and thunderstorms could dump up to 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) of rain through the day, but the real concern was that some areas could be drenched with a half-inch to 1.3 to 2.5 centimeters of rain in just an hour, causing streams, creeks and rivers to overflow, the weather service said. </p>
<p>On Thursday, motorists were stranded in their vehicles on flooded roadways northwest of Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Downpours swamped areas in the cities of Port Hueneme, Oxnard and Santa Barbara, where a police detective carried a woman on his back after the SUV she was riding in got stuck in knee-deep floodwaters.</p>
<p>Between midnight and 1 a.m., the storm dumped 8 centimeters of rainfall in downtown Oxnard, surpassing the area’s average of 6.5 centimeters for the entire month of December, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>Hours later, at Heritage Coffee and Gifts in downtown Oxnard, manager Carlos Larios said the storm hadn’t made a dent in their Thursday morning rush despite “gloomy” skies.</p>
<p>“People are still coming in to get coffee, which is surprising,” he said. “I don’t think the rain is going to stop many people from being out and about.”</p>
<p>By midday, the rain and wind had eased, and residents ventured outside to look at the damage. No serious damage or injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Sven Dybdahl, owner of olive oil and vinegar store Viva Oliva in downtown Santa Barbara, said he had trouble finding dry routes to work Thursday morning, but most of the heavy rains and flooding had receded shortly before 11 a.m.</p>
<p>He said he was grateful that the weather is only expected to be an issue for a few days at the tail end of the holiday shopping season, otherwise he’d be worried about how the rain would affect his store’s bottom line.</p>
<p>“It will have an impact, but thankfully it’s happening quite late,” he said.</p>
<p>“This is a genuinely dramatic storm,” climate scientist Daniel Swain, of the University of California, Los Angeles, said in an online briefing. “In Oxnard, particularly, overnight there were downpours that preliminary data suggests were probably the heaviest downpours ever observed in that part of Southern California.”</p>
<p>The storm swept through Northern California earlier in the week as the center of the low-pressure system slowly moved south off the coast. Forecasters described it as a “cutoff low,” a storm that is cut off from the general west-to-east flow and can linger for days, increasing the amount of rainfall.</p>
<p>The system was producing hit-and-miss bands of precipitation rather than generalized widespread rainfall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Californians were gearing up for holiday travel and finishing preparations for Christmas. The Automobile Club of Southern California estimates 9.5 million people in the region will travel during the year-end holiday period.</p>
<p>The Northeast was hit with an unexpectedly strong storm earlier this week, and some parts of Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont were still digging out from rain and wind damage. Parts of Maine along the Androscoggin and Kennebec rivers were hit especially hard.</p>
<p>At least seven people in East Coast states have died in the storms, with deaths reported in Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts and Maine.</p>

<h2 id="the-year-states-passed-on-gas">The Year States Passed on Gas</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
One of the biggest climate stories of the year — the first, and perhaps only, to go viral — didn’t so much draw attention to the warming planet as it did to the dangers of using fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
During the second week of January, <em>Bloomberg </em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-09/us-safety-agency-to-consider-ban-on-gas-stoves-amid-health-fears" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that a federal safety agency would “consider a ban on gas stoves amid health fears.” Though the headline was somewhat misleading — the commission was investigating the risks of cooking with gas, but a ban was not immediately forthcoming — the article invited swift backlash.
</p>
<p>
The next day, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> editorial board <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-is-coming-for-your-gas-stove-consumer-product-safety-commission-richard-trumka-environmental-protection-agency-11673303864" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published an op-ed</a> warning readers that “Biden is coming for your gas stove.” Conservative politicians expressed their undying loyalty to the appliance. “If the maniacs in the White House come for my stove, they can pry it from my cold dead hands. COME AND TAKE IT!!,” Ronny Jackson, a Republican congressman from Texas, <a href="https://twitter.com/RonnyJacksonTX/status/1612839703018934274" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on Twitter. Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida <a href="https://flvoicenews.com/desantis-team-advertises-dont-tread-on-florida-aprons-with-gas-stoves/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">designed aprons</a> bearing an illustration of a gas stove that said “Don’t Tread on Florida.” Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia also piled on, <a href="https://twitter.com/Sen_JoeManchin/status/1612903995605147649" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweeting</a>, “I can tell you the last thing that would ever leave my house is the gas stove that we cook on.” House Republicans eventually passed a bill called the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1615" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Gas Stove Protection and Freedom Act</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, everyday Americans were trying to make sense of the news that their gas stoves could be harming them. Every major media outlet ran stories on the risks of cooking with gas and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/11/well/live/gas-stoves-health-risks.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">how to minimize them</a>. “How bad is it actually?,” friends started asking me over drinks.
</p>
<p>
It’s not good. Burning natural gas releases nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant that contributes to respiratory illnesses like asthma. Concentrations from cooking can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S036013231730255X?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">often exceed government standards</a> for outdoor air quality. Proper ventilation with a range hood can <a href="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2018/03/06/use-your-range-hood-for-a-healthier-home-advises-indoor-air-quality-researcher/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reduce your exposure</a>. But it won’t do anything about the effects gas has on the climate.
</p>
<p>
About <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks#:~:text=Key%20findings%20from%20the%201990,sequestration%20from%20the%20land%20sector." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">13% of U.S. emissions</a> come from the fuels burned in buildings. Stoves may be a small part of that, but officials in some of the most climate-forward cities and states have been grappling with reducing the use of all fossil fuel-burning appliances in buildings for a number of years now. In February, the Building Decarbonization Coalition <a href="https://grist.org/buildings/how-the-electrify-everything-movement-went-mainstream/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a> that 98 municipalities and four states — California, Washington, Maryland, and Colorado — had adopted policies promoting a switch to electric appliances. When the gas stove hysteria erupted, one in five Americans was already living under laws that encouraged or required landlords and developers to eschew gas.
</p>
<p>
A lot has happened in the months since, and not every state is swimming in the same direction on the issue. But in 2023, policymakers took big leaps toward a future without gas in buildings in three key ways:

<strong>1. The first statewide ban on gas i</strong><strong>n new buildings</strong>
</p>
<p>
There’s no blueprint for how to decommission thousands of miles of gas pipelines and retrofit millions of homes with electric appliances in a systematic, let alone equitable way. As a start, policymakers have generally followed the Law of Holes, as in, the first step is to stop digging — or in this case, stop growing demand for gas.
</p>
<p>
In 2019, the city of Berkeley, California, led the way, passing the first ordinance in the country to prohibit gas hookups in new buildings, and dozens of other cities followed. This year, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/new-york-climate-budget" target="_self">New York became the first</a> state to enact such a policy. The law requires all new buildings that are smaller than seven stories to be fully electric beginning in 2026, and applies to taller buildings in 2029.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s huge that a state is doing it, not only because New York is a big-impact state,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/05/03/us/new-york-natural-gas-ban-climate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told CNN</a> at the time. It’s no longer “fringe cities passing these policies,” she said. “This is becoming a mainstream policy that a state like New York is taking on.”
</p>
<p>
However, this year also saw a continuation of Republican-led states taking the opposite tack. Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Idaho joined <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/half-of-us-states-are-on-pace-to-prohibit-local-gas-bans-76245300" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a list of 24 states</a> that have passed laws prohibiting municipalities from setting these kinds of restrictions on gas in buildings. By my estimation, using 2022 population data from the U.S. Census Bureau, that means two in five Americans live in states with such preemption laws.
</p>
<p>
Berkeley’s gas ban was also <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/berkeley-gas-ban-future" target="_self">struck down</a> by a federal appeals court, and the city is now fighting for a rehearing. That decision led to some uncertainty, but no loss of momentum. In Washington, where regulators created a de facto ban on gas in new construction through the building code last year, officials recently <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/new-homes-in-washington-will-have-to-include-energy-efficient-heating-and-cooling" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">amended the code</a> to safeguard it against legal challenges.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Limits on investment in the gas </strong><strong>system</strong>
</p>
<p>
Utilities typically spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year maintaining, replacing, and building new pipes — funds they expect to recover from ratepayers over the course of decades.
</p>
<p>
This year, in a few states with strong emission reduction laws that imply heating will have to be electrified in the next few decades, regulators started to scrutinize these investments more. In Illinois, for example, the Commerce Commission ordered People’s Gas, which serves the Chicago area, to pause its pipe replacement program, rejecting the company’s request to hike rates to fund it.
</p>
<p>
“This program was deeply flawed,” Abe Scarr, state director of the Public Interest Research Group in Illinois, told me. It was supposed to address the real problem of risky iron pipes, but it had been mismanaged and over-budget for years, he said. At the current rate, the company won’t be done until 2049, “right around the time that a lot of us think we should be stopping to use the gas system.”
</p>
<p>
The commission ordered an investigation into the program. It also initiated a new “Future of Gas” proceeding for all utilities in the state to determine how to align the sector with Illinois’ clean energy goals. “As the State embarks on a journey toward a 100 percent clean energy economy, the gas system’s operations will not continue to exist in its current form,” said Illinois Commerce Commission Chairman Doug Scott in a <a href="https://ltgov.illinois.gov/news/press-release.27314.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, regulators in Massachusetts were wrapping up their own “Future of Gas” proceeding that had kicked off in 2020. In early December, the state’s Department of Public Utilities <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/department-of-public-utilities-issues-order-20-80" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a final order</a> declaring, among many other things, that it will no longer allow companies to recover costs for gas infrastructure without showing that alternatives, like helping customers electrify, were considered. Regulators also rejected the utilities’ preferred path to reducing emissions — switching to lower-carbon fuels like renewable natural gas and hydrogen — as not yet proven. Unless and until the evidence changes, any money the companies spend investigating these solutions will have to be covered by shareholders, not ratepayers.
</p>
<p>
Also this year, Massachusetts began testing one potentially more systematic pathway to transition off gas. Eversource, a utility there, broke ground on <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/networked-geothermal-thermal-energy-community" target="_self">a first-of-its-kind project</a> to switch an entire neighborhood to “networked geothermal,” a form of electric heating that draws on the steady temperature of the ground beneath the earth’s surface to heat and cool buildings.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. Prohibi</strong><strong>tions on charging customers for marketing and lobbying</strong>
</p>
<p>
In many states, it’s standard practice for utilities to bake the cost of political activities like lobbying, advertising, and trade association memberships into customers’ gas and electric rates. These activities often amount to efforts to slow down the clean energy transition — for example, an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/17/1183551603/gas-stove-utility-tobacco" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investigation</a> published this year found that the American Gas Association has fought to stifle warnings about the risks of gas stoves for decades.
</p>
<p>
“[Utilities] are conscripting their customers into an unknowing army of millions of small-dollar donors to prolong the era of dirty energy,” David Pomerantz, executive director of the nonprofit Energy and Policy Institute, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/05/opinion/utility-bills-clean-energy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em></a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
But now Maine, Colorado, and Connecticut, have all outlawed the practice; if utilities in those states want to spend money on lobbying or trade groups, they’ll have to pay for it out of their own profits. Massachusetts regulators took a similar step, banning gas companies from charging customers for any marketing related to the promotion of natural gas.
</p>
<p>
I asked Mike Henchen, a principal at the clean energy think tank RMI who follows gas utility regulation around the country, what the next wave of action on the issue might look like.
</p>
<p>
He said he expects progress to continue next year, with states rolling out <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/inflation-reduction-act-solar-panels-heat-pumps" target="_self">rebates for heat pumps</a> with money from the Inflation Reduction Act. Some, like New Jersey and Maryland may follow the playbooks written by first movers like New York and Massachusetts, and those leading states could continue to break new ground. One of the next fronts, he said, is removing the gas industry’s “obligation to serve,” a rule written into most state laws that gives customers the right to demand gas service. That means that even if there’s a strong economic argument to electrify a city block rather than replace a risky pipeline, one resident’s refusal could sink the whole project.
</p>
<p>
On the bright side, some utilities are starting to talk more openly about needing to reduce the amount of natural gas they sell to customers, Henchen told me. But midway through sharing this thought, he stopped to laugh. “I laugh, because it seems like it should be more obvious that that is the case.”

<h2 id="biden-signs-order-aimed-at-financial-facilitators-of-russian-military">Biden Signs Order Aimed at Financial Facilitators of Russian Military</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order Friday giving the Treasury Department the authority to target financial institutions that facilitate Russia’s efforts to bolster its defense industry.</p>
<p>The new sanctions authority is meant to gum up the Kremlin’s push to restock the Russian military’s depleted arsenal after 22 months of fighting in Ukraine. Russia has already lost over 13,000 pieces of equipment, including tanks, drones and missile systems, according to a U.S. assessment.</p>
<p>The order also seeks to tighten existing restrictions on diamonds and seafood imported from Russia after a review by U.S. agencies.</p>
<p>“We expect financial institutions will undertake every effort to ensure that they are not witting or unwitting facilitators of circumvention and evasion,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement announcing the order. “And we will not hesitate to use the new tools provided by this authority to take decisive, and surgical, action against financial institutions that facilitate the supply of Russia’s war machine.”</p>
<p>The latest effort to tighten pressure on Russia comes just weeks after Biden and G7 leaders met virtually to discuss support for Ukraine as rancor spreads in Washington over the cost of backing Kyiv in a war that has no end in sight.</p>
<p>The White House has been locked in talks with key lawmakers to approve more money for Ukraine. Biden has proposed $110 billion package of wartime aid for Ukraine, Israel and other national security priorities. GOP lawmakers have declined to approve the money until the White House agrees to major immigration and U.S.-Mexico border policy changes. The Defense Department says it has nearly run out of available funds for supporting Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>The G7 leaders said in a statement following the December 6 meeting that they would work to curtail Russia’s use of the international financial system to further its war in Ukraine and target “Russian military procurement networks and those who help Russia acquire machine tools, equipment and key inputs.”</p>
<p>Russian defense spending rose by almost 75% in the first half of 2023, and Russia is on track for record military spending next year.</p>
<p>“This executive order comes at a critical juncture,” Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo wrote in a Financial Times op-ed published Friday. “By raising the stakes for banks supporting sensitive trade with Russia and continuing to sanction new front companies and procurement networks, our coalition is pouring sand into the gears of Russia’s military logistics.”</p>

<h2 id="conversation-vs-publishing">Conversation vs publishing</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Conversation has a place, but I think we’ve explored that pretty well, and now I want to create better publishing and reading systems, that are as fast as social web systems, but place less emphasis on replies that can be seen by everyone, because that often is not really conversation, it’s spam.
</p>
<p>
I think ultimately we’ll be disappointed with federation for all the reasons we’re frustrated with earlier social web systems. People trying to get attention for their ideas, which often are spam or trolling. I also think this means RSS will be more valuable going forward because it’s great at publishing, checking all the <a href="http://textcasting.org/">textcasting</a> boxes.
</p>
<p>
I plan to build with and around WordPress. I think of WordPress as a basic platform the way I saw Twitter between 2006 and 2022. Now the question is what are the steps to use WordPress as the back-end of a social communication system. Behind the scenes, its database has all the capabilities we need to provide the tools writers need. And it has excellent RSS support. It all runs at scale and has a mature yet simple API. That is all we need to form a hub.

<p>Here, rather than an individual card to each of my subscribers, is the jacket of my new novel to be published by Jonathan Cape on Feb 1, 2024. With it, I wish you all a Happy New Year! I take the title from Philip Larkin’s poem An Arundel Tomb. That’s the one in which Larkin notes with ‘sharp tender shock’ that the entombed earl has removed his gauntlet and has been holding the countess’s hand for centuries. The feelings defy the cold stone in which they’re expressed. It’s an elegant poem, similarly defying its own rigidity. If you can read it and not weep a stony tear you have never held a lover’s hand. I can’t go for long without a hand in my mine. I’ve always been a love poet masquerading as a Rabelaisian novelist, it’s just that no one has noticed. In my new novel – as the title suggests - I celebrate love from its first ecstatic minute to its final devotional hour and make fewer jokes than in earlier work.</p>

But to qualify for the subsidy, would-be hydrogen producers will have to demonstrate that they used clean, zero-carbon electricity to power their <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-electrolysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">electrolyzers</a>, the energy-hungry machines that pull hydrogen out of water or other molecules.

Some industry groups allege the new rules could stunt the field in its infancy. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo was effusive about the new rules’ benefits. “We’ve developed a structure that will drive innovation and create good-paying jobs in this emerging industry while strengthening our energy security and reducing emissions in hard-to-transition sectors of the economy,” he told reporters.

<li>Analysis shows U.S. battery production is on track to meet demand
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>New analysis from the Environmental Defense Fund, provided <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/us-ev-battery-production-demand" target="_self">exclusively to Heatmap</a>, suggests that U.S. battery production is going really well. The data shows American battery manufacturers around the country — many of them automakers — have announced over 1,000 gigawatt hours of U.S. battery production that’s slated to come online by 2028, far outpacing projected demand.

As Heatmap’s Neel Dhanesha <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/us-ev-battery-production-demand" target="_self">explains</a>, this matters because the Inflation Reduction Act stipulates that, in order to be eligible for tax credits, electric vehicle components can’t be made by a country on the U.S.’s “foreign entities of concern” list. That rules out batteries made in China. Without an increase in American battery manufacturing, we run the risk of Americans being either unwilling or unable to pay for the EVs that we’d need to hit strict new EPA vehicle emissions standards.

<li>7,000 car dealers join portal for quick EV tax credit payments
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Let’s stick with EVs for a moment: The U.S. Treasury today announced that more than 7,000 car dealers have registered with the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1868" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">IRS Energy Credits Online portal</a>. Many electric vehicles are eligible for sizable federal tax credits, and this portal, unveiled last month, helps streamline the crediting process by allowing dealers to apply the credit as a kind of discount at the point of sale. If the dealer is registered on the portal, they can submit the sales information to the IRS and receive payment for the value of the credits within 72 hours.

<h2 id="bidens-new-hydrogen-rules-are-here.-theyre-way-bigger-than-hydrogen.">Biden’s New Hydrogen Rules Are Here. They’re Way Bigger Than Hydrogen.</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDkwMjEyNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcwOTU2NDI4NX0.5-Y9TlcTWt_q28QCdsNPFnsZ1gtGmiUopoiE3BYg1hg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The most generous, lucrative, and all-around lavish subsidy in President Joe Biden’s climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, is the new tax credit for clean hydrogen production. Under the policy, a company can get a bounty of up to $3 for each kilogram of hydrogen made with clean electricity that it produces and sells. There are few legal limits to what a company can earn.
</p>
<p>
So it figures, then, that this subsidy has been the subject of maybe the most acrimonious, dramatic, hair-tearing fight over the law so far, one that saw snoozy lobbyists and power plant operators take out Spotify spots and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/21/advertising-blitz-behind-bidens-hydrogen-tax-credits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">full-page <em>New York Times</em> ads</a> in order to make their point.
</p>
<p>
On Friday, the first phase of that battle ended — and the side supported by most environmental groups claimed a provisional victory. The Biden administration proposed strict rules governing the tax credit, designed to ensure that only zero-carbon electricity meeting rigorous standards can be used to make subsidized hydrogen. The rules, which some industry groups allege could stunt the field in its infancy, will have far-reaching consequences not only for hydrogen itself, but for how America’s power grid prepares for an age of abundant, zero-carbon electricity. It will create a system for organizing clean electricity that could soon determine how companies, consumers, and the federal government buy and sell that electricity — even when it has nothing to do with hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
But all of that is in the future. Now, to get the highest value of the tax credit, companies must — like other subsidies in the law — demonstrate that they paid a prevailing wage and took advantage of local apprenticeship programs.
</p>
<p>
They also must demonstrate that they used clean, zero-carbon electricity to power their <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-electrolysis" target="_blank">electrolyzers</a>, the energy-hungry machines that pull hydrogen out of water or other molecules. And defining clean electricity <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self">has proven to be an enormous challenge</a>. However the Biden administration chose to define it, someone was going to be left out — or let in.
</p>
<p>
Consider just one hypothetical. Pretend you own a fancy new electrolyzer. If you buy power for it from a wind farm that’s already hooked up to the grid, then another power plant will have to replace the electrons that you’re now using. That marginal electricity will probably have to come from a coal or natural gas power plant, meaning that it will need to burn extra fuel, meaning it will release extra carbon pollution. Does that mean that the electricity that <em>you </em>bought is actually clean? And if not, do you still get the tax credit?
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, climate groups proposed that any clean electricity used to make hydrogen had to meet three requirements: It had to come from a truly new source of power on the grid; it had to generate power at the same time that it was used; and it had to be produced on essentially the same grid where it was used. The Biden administration largely adopted those requirements in Friday’s proposal. On a briefing call with reporters ahead of the rule’s release, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo was effusive about the new rule’s benefits. “We’ve developed a structure that will drive innovation and create good-paying jobs in this emerging industry while strengthening our energy security and reducing emissions in hard-to-transition sectors of the economy,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Not everyone feels that way. Senator Joe Manchin, who provided a key vote for the IRA, <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4362098-manchin-hydrogen-tax-credit-guidance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Bloomberg </em>that the draft</a> is “horrible” and promised that “we are fighting it.”
</p>
<p>
“It doesn’t do anything the bill does. They basically made it 10 times more stringent for hydrogen,” he said. The trade group for the nuclear industry has also expressed its “disappointment,” arguing, more or less correctly, that the proposal “effectively eliminates all existing clean energy from qualifying” for the credit.
</p>
<p>
But debate about the proposal has not quite run on green vs. industry lines. Air Products, the world’s largest hydrogen producer, <a href="https://hystorenergy.com/hydrogen-industry-support-of-strong-45v-rules/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has backed the administration’s approach</a>, as have half a dozen other hydrogen companies. So has <a href="https://www.synergetic.partners/#:~:text=Synergetic%20is%20accelerating%20the%20adoption,delivery%2C%20storage%20markets%20and%20policy." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Synergetic</a>, a hydrogen developer that recently left the trade group the American Clean Power Association to protest its laxer stance. “Consumer groups are behind these rules, and environmental justice has also come out to express support,” Rachel Fakhry, a policy director at the Natural Resource Defense Council, told me.
</p>
<p>
The excessive focus on the hydrogen tax credit has been, in one sense, surprising. If you care most about cutting carbon pollution in the near-term, the hydrogen tax credit is unlikely to be the most important part of the IRA. Other policies — such as <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/investment-tax-credit-guidance-interconnection-grid-biden" target="_self">the clean electricity tax credit</a>, which could add vast amounts of new wind and solar to the grid, or <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2023" target="_self">new subsidies for electric vehicles</a> — will likely reduce greenhouse gas pollution by far more in the next decade.
</p>
<p>
But a clean hydrogen industry <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/bidens-grand-energy-plan-is-finally-getting-real" target="_self">could soon be crucial</a> to the climate fight. Hydrogen could eventually be used to fuel medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which are responsible for <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">roughly a quarter of the country’s transportation emissions</a>.
</p>
<p>
It could also decarbonize the production of steel, chemicals, and fertilizer, all of which require fossil fuels today. These are a looming climate problem: By the middle of this decade, heavy industry will pollute the climate more than any other sector of the American economy, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Yet this does not explain why the hydrogen tax credit attracted so much attention. It became a big fight, in short, because it stood the biggest chance of backfiring. Because the tax credit is <em>so</em> generous, incentivizing hydrogen companies to use more and more power, it risked gobbling up too much electricity and distorting the country’s power markets. In the disaster-movie scenario, the tax credit could wind up like the federal government’s ethanol subsidies, which <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-true-cost-of-corn-ethanol" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have cost billions</a> while <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/us-corn-based-ethanol-worse-climate-than-gasoline-study-finds-2022-02-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">doing nothing to help the climate</a>.
</p>
<p>
The hydrogen tax credit “has been the most challenging piece of policy that we’ve had to contend with,” John Podesta, the White House adviser in charge of implementing the IRA, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/john-podesta-tax-credits-schedule-hydrogen-sustainable-aviation-fuel-manufacturing" target="_self">told me on the sidelines</a> of COP28 in Dubai earlier this month.
</p>
<p>
He described the administration as balancing between two extremes. On the one hand, overly strict rules could cause companies to invest more in so-called “blue hydrogen,” which is produced by separating natural gas and capturing the resulting carbon. Yet overly loose rules could cause emissions to balloon and power prices to soar.
</p>
<p>
“We could kind of blow it in either direction, I think,” he said.
</p>
<p>
This hasn’t always been seen as a problem. Since the IRA passed last year, the clean hydrogen tax credit has stood out for its extreme generosity, which goes far beyond what is contemplated by other tax credits in the law.
</p>
<p>
Once the Treasury Department decides that a hydrogen project qualifies for the tax credit, for instance, then that project can receive credits for the next 10 years. For five of those years, it can even get that money as a direct payment from the government, rather than as a tax cut. What’s more, projects can qualify for the tax credit as long as they begin construction by 2033. That means the tax credit will still be used well into the 2040s, even if Congress does not extend it.
</p>
<p>
Almost no other policy in the law spends federal dollars so lavishly or directly. Manchin, who negotiated the final text of the IRA with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, has long championed the hydrogen industry and seen it as a way to use fossil-fuel assets, such as pipelines, in the energy transition.
</p>
<p>
Soon after the IRA passed, however, climate advocates realized that this generosity could pose risks to the rest of the law. In the summer of 2022, Wilson Ricks, an engineering Ph.D. student at Princeton, was interning for the Department of Energy, studying how to measure the climate impact of hydrogen produced by electrolysis.
</p>
<p>
Ricks had already concluded that the “lifecycle” of the electricity used to make hydrogen mattered: If electricity from a nuclear power plant was sent to an electrolyzer instead of the power grid, thereby forcing a natural-gas plant to turn on and send power to the grid instead, then so-called “clean hydrogen” could actually result in more climate pollution than the traditional approach of using natural gas to make hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
Then the IRA passed, and “potentially hundreds of billions of dollars hinged on that question,” he told me. In January, Ricks and his colleagues at <a href="https://environmenthalfcentury.princeton.edu/experts/jesse-jenkins" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Princeton’s ZERO Lab</a> <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/acacb5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published a study</a> urging the Biden administration to adopt stringent guidelines for the tax credit. Without hourly matching, they concluded, the subsidy could wreak havoc in the country’s electricity markets.
</p>
<p>
Ricks wasn’t the only expert suddenly worried about what a giant new hydrogen subsidy could do to electricity markets. Nearly a year earlier, Taylor Sloane, an energy developer for the utility and power company AES, virtually predicted the hydrogen fight <a href="https://medium.com/@tsloane/what-should-be-considered-green-hydrogen-b2fa2cfe1753" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in a Medium post</a>.
</p>
<p>
“The reason it matters that we get these rules right is that we don’t want to have an environmental backlash against green hydrogen in a few years demonstrating how it actually <em>increases</em> emissions,” he wrote. “Getting the rules right from the start will ensure more stable long-term growth of green hydrogen.”
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the administration decided that nearly all clean electricity used to produce hydrogen must meet three requirements — largely inherited from the climate groups’ proposals. They also mirror hydrogen regulations already adopted in the European Union.
</p>
<p>
First, the electricity must come from a relatively new source of zero-carbon power, such as a wind or nuclear plant: You can’t use electrons that once would have powered homes or cars to power an electrolyzer.
</p>
<p>
Second, the electricity must be produced at roughly the same time that it is used to make hydrogen: You can’t buy cheap solar power at noon and claim that you’re using it to make hydrogen at midnight.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the electricity must have been made on the same power grid that the electrolyzer itself is using: You can’t buy wind power in Iowa and claim that you’re using it to make hydrogen in Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>
Today, no power company in the country has a way of certifying that its electricity meets all three requirements of the new hydrogen rule — and none has any way of selling it, either. So the rules also require local power grids to set up and sell “energy attribute certificates,” or EACs, which certify that a given kilowatt-hour of electricity was produced on a certain grid, at a certain time, and using a certain source of clean energy.
</p>
<p>
Utilities and grid managers have until 2028 to launch this new system; until then, hydrogen companies can keep using the existing system of renewable energy credits, or RECs, which certify only that zero-carbon electricity was generated during a certain year.
</p>
<p>
Although this new system of EACs may sound like so much bureaucratic legerdemain, it could eventually become more important than the hydrogen tax credit itself, because it could all but reshape how the country’s electricity systems work.
</p>
<p>
Right now, even though the availability of clean energy rises and falls throughout the day — solar panels make more power at noon than at midnight, for instance — there is no way to buy or sell claims to that power. By creating a systematic way to describe and sell an hour of clean electricity, EACs could actually create a market for 24/7 clean electricity.
</p>
<p>
The existence of that system could alter corporate sustainability pledges, climate-friendly government orders, and even how companies measure their own progress toward meeting their Paris Agreement goals. Even though hundreds of American companies say that they buy their electricity from zero-carbon sources, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/microsoft-google-others-partner-with-levelten-to-create-first-marketplace-for-24-7-clean-energy/#:~:text=LATEST%20NEWS-,Microsoft%2C%20Google%2C%20others%20partner%20with%20LevelTen%20Energy%20to%20create%20first,for%2024%2F7%20clean%20energy&text=A%20growing%20number%20of%20organizations,energy%20to%20power%20their%20operations." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">only Google, Microsoft, and a few other companies</a> have committed to buying 24/7 clean electricity.
</p>
<p>
“I know the administration faced absurd amounts of pressure given how lucrative this is,” Ricks told me. “But it seems like they pretty much held firm and went with the science.”
</p>
<p>
That said, the proposal kicks two issues down the road. It asks companies whether it should allow any exceptions to the general rule requiring that clean electricity come from clean sources. Some nuclear power plant operators, for instance, have argued that electricity from a nuclear plant should count toward the credit if the plant would otherwise be slated to shut down.
</p>
<p>
That decision could shape other administration priorities. <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-hydrogen-hubs-silicon-valley" target="_self">Two of the government’s seven proposed “hydrogen hubs,”</a> new industrial facilities funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law, are planning to use nuclear power to generate clean hydrogen. Under the current rules, these hubs may not qualify for the generous hydrogen tax credit, even though they could still earn billions in other subsidies.
</p>
<p>
The proposal also asks for advice about how to count so-called renewable natural gas, which is captured methane released from cows or landfills. Some environmentalists worry that the rules for this technology, if poorly drafted, could allow companies to engage in aggressive carbon accounting that does not align with reality. But so far, the Biden administration seems to have little appetite for that approach.

<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
This is the 17th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Chris Butler and his blog, <a href="https://www.chrbutler.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">chrbutler.com</a>

<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Hi, I’m Chris Butler. I’m a digital graphic designer. I work at <a href="https://newfangled.com">Newfangled.com</a> and write at <a href="https://chrbutler.com">Chrbutler.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was fortunate to study art and design at <a href="https://risd.edu">RISD.edu</a>. While majoring in Film/Animation/Video, I became interested in motion graphics, which began a winding path toward interaction design.
</p>
<p>
Though I’ve been happily settled in Durham, NC for over a decade now – the longest I’ve lived in one spot! – I’ve lived in many places; the most distant was Penang, Malaysia.
</p>
<p>
I was recently asked to choose three adjectives to describe myself. The first that came to mind was “curious.” I have more interests than I have time to pursue them. Many come up in the course of my writing. More on that in a bit…
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What's the story behind your blog?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I’m not sure there’s much of a story other than that I’ve always wanted to maintain a record of some kind. I created my first webpage in the late 1990s and have tried to maintain the ability to do so ever since. I’ve kept several different personal URLs over the years, but my current one (<a href="https://chrbutler.com">chrbutler.com</a>) – just the shortest viable and available version of my name when I registered it – has endured the longest.
</p>
<p>
I’ve written professionally at several different places. <a href="https://newfangled.com">Newfangled.com</a> has been where I’ve published the most practical writing on interaction design. I wrote the Interaction design column for PRINT Magazine for several years, contributed to their blog as well as their sister publication, HOW Magazine, and wrote a book published by HOW Books called The Strategic Web Designer. I’ve also written for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com">SmashingMagazine.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
But on my website, I’m less focused on a particular topic. I’m much more seasonal in the way I write there – sometimes longer, developed essays, sometimes very brief blog posts. Most of the time, I share my writing with my email list.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I keep a “Files” drive connected to my machine, and on it, a folder called “TEXTS.” In it are a few sub-folders: Articles, Fragments, Journal, Notes. In those are thousands of .txt files. I back this up on another RAID drive and on the cloud.
</p>
<p>
Every day I create some kind of entry on that drive. If it’s not a journal entry, I typically start with hastily writing down scattered comments about something I am thinking about and save it to the Notes folder. If I begin to develop that entry, I’ll usually move it up to the root level. When it’s finished, I file it under Articles. If it languishes for too long, I’ll move it to Fragments. Every now and then, I mine the Fragments folder. Most of the time, I read over something and remark, “what on Earth was I thinking.” But every now and then, I’ll pull something back out of there and work on it again. A few months ago, I published an essay called “<a href="https://www.chrbutler.com/personal-machines-and-portable-worlds">Personal Machines and Portable Worlds</a>” that was the result of several resurrections from the Fragments folder – some nearly a decade old.
</p>
<p>
When I’m ready to publish something, I duplicate the .txt file to a Dropbox folder that syncs with my <a href="https://blot.im">Blot.im</a> account. Blot is a lovely, simple flat-file CMS. I’ve used it for many years now and would recommend it to anyone.

<strong>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I have these childhood memories of visiting my sister’s room, which was always in a state of near-chaos, and being inspired by the energy in there. She’d often be making things and always had a creative spark that was just so different from mine. I began to associate creativity and disorder, which, for me, has been a lifelong irony because, back then, I’d return to my room, which I’d probably just meticulously cleaned. I’m still that way – I put a huge amount of energy toward creating and maintaining order. I’ve learned over the years that creativity isn’t dependent upon either disorder or order. Both can feed it.
</p>
<p>
And so both are present in my working space. I’ll probably always lean more toward order (<a href="https://www.chrbutler.com/organization-office">this post on my setup will make that clear</a>), but the disorder comes from having a lot of variety available around me. I love having interesting things to look at – even just a glance at something can inspire me and fuel me through the day. I am constantly shuffling the things on my office’s display shelves to feed my mind with images and ideas that I can use.

<p>
<strong>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The post I referenced above will provide much more exhaustive detail on this, but to summarize:
</p>
<p>
I work at home, and my primary machine is an M1 Mac Mini. I haven’t owned a laptop in many years. I like to keep my computer time focused in one place, for the most part (though I do have an iPad Mini, which is a very useful device and optimally sized, in my opinion). I connect into a large LG display and communicate via Zoom using a Sony a7c and a Shure SM7B connected through a Focusrite Scarlett interface.
</p>
<p>
I write with Ulysses and store all my text files on a 1TB NVMe SSD I assembled myself. I back up everything on a LaCIE RAID.
</p>
<p>
As I mentioned above, my blog is run on Blot.im and all its files are stored on Dropbox.
</p>
<p>
I’m an evangelist for maintaining an uninterruptible power supply (UPS). In a time of increasingly weird weather, power outages are becoming more common. The CyberPower CP1500 keeps us up and running so we can save our work and shutdown when we feel like it.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Content-wise, I don’t think so. I like the personal nature of my website and how its variety reflects who I am. If I were motivated to build a larger audience and somehow monetize that attention, then specializing in some way would probably be necessary. But that’s not what my website is for.
</p>
<p>
What my website is for is, first and foremost, to be a record for me. I like that it traces interests and modes over the years, and I like that it’s there for anyone to see. On that note, it’s also for making connections. I have made numerous friends through engaging online. These are relationships that have developed far beyond digital acquaintance – they’ve gone deep and lasted for many years. I met of my very good friends because I commented on his blog and then he on mine. I love that the internet makes this possible.
</p>
<p>
Technically and creatively, of course I am often itchy. I routinely want to try out a new technology or platform and experiment with the design. I’ve revamped my site plenty of times, but the ease of the flat-file approach on Blot is hard to trade in for something that might offer me more creative options. It makes it easy for me to write and publish things, which has always been the point.
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
The website’s <em>direct</em>, yearly costs are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
domain name registration: $16
</li>
<li>
blot.im account: $40
</li>
<li>
Dropbox account: $120
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Total: $176
</p>
<p>
That breaks down to ~$15/month, which is a pretty cheap price for such an enriching hobby, I think.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the site generates no revenue! Like some of your previous guests, it has created connections that have led to money through various side writing, speaking, or consulting work, but that’s never been its purpose. When that happens, it’s a nice thing, and I’m happy to leave it at that for now. (It has happened a handful of times, and in the aggregate, they have paid for the all-time costs of the site so far. I’d be fine with it if that wasn’t true.)
</p>
<p>
My position on monetizing personal blogs is to each their own!
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
Patrick Tanguay’s Sentiers (<a href="https://sentiers.media/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">sentiers.media</a>) is a must. I will read anything that Maciej Ceglowski (<a href="https://idlewords.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">idlewords.com</a>) writes. Erin Kissane recently wrapped a series examining Meta’s role in the genocide of Rohingya people in Myanmar (<a href="https://erinkissane.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">erinkissane.com</a>).
</p>
<p>
Lara Hogan’s wisdom overflows here: <a href="https://larahogan.me/">larahogan.me</a>. Reading Nicholas Magand (<a href="https://thejollyteapot.com/">thejollyteapot.com</a>) got me to loosen up on my blog. Maggie Appleton (<a href="https://maggieappleton.com/">maggieappleton.com</a>) is inspiring. I like Carl Barenbrug’s blog (<a href="http://carlbarenbrug.com">carlbarenbrug.com</a>), Chris Hannah’s (<a href="https://chrishannah.me/">chrishannah.me</a>), and Jose Gilgado’s (<a href="https://josem.co/articles/">josem.co</a>). Scott Buffington’s “Full Pints” posts always yield something of interest (<a href="https://irongeek.net/">irongeek.net</a>).
</p>
<p>
I just met Robert Rackley through my own blog and I’ve been enjoying catching up on his (<a href="https://canneddragons.net/">canneddragons.net</a>).
</p>
<p>
When it comes to the weird, I never miss a post from Håkan Blomqvist (<a href="https://ufoarchives.blogspot.com/">ufoarchives.blogspot.com</a>) or The Anomalist (<a href="https://www.anomalist.com">anomalist.com</a>).
</p>
</div>
<div class="q">
<p>
<strong>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</strong>
</p>
</div>
<div class="a">
<p>
I wrapped my last episode of my <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/design-tomorrow/id1433919260">Design Tomorrow podcast</a> nearly five years ago, but I still think it’s good and worth a listen.

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas faces escalating calls to recuse himself from upcoming cases centered on former President Donald Trump&amp;#8217;s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The requests gained new urgency in recent days as consequential cases related to Trump speed toward the high court. Critics &amp;#8211; including Democrats in the House and Senate &amp;#8211; say Thomas&amp;#8217;s wife&amp;#8217;s publicly documented efforts to challenge the 2020 election results should disqualify him from making decisions on pivotal issues related to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Thomas, who was appointed by former President George H. W. Bush, has garnered a reputation for refusing to back down to his critics. But legal experts said it will be more difficult for Thomas to ignore the requests to abstain from participation in the Trump cases this time &amp;#8211; particularly considering provisions of the Supreme Court&amp;#8217;s new code of ethics. &amp;#8220;Under the standard in the new Supreme Court code, an objective, unbiased observer would question whether Justice Thomas can be objective in a case so closely related to his wife&amp;#8217;s political interests,&amp;#8221; said Steven Lubet, a judicial ethics expert at Northwestern University&amp;#8217;s Pritzker School of Law. The code, released in November, was signed by all nine justices. It includes a section saying a justice should recuse him or herself if their &amp;#8220;impartiality might be reasonably questioned.&amp;#8221; The code specifies that a justice&amp;#8217;s spouse having an &amp;#8220;interest that could be affected substantially&amp;#8221; by a case or who could be a &amp;#8220;material witness in the proceeding&amp;#8221; would be grounds for recusal. No Precedent&lt;/p&gt;

<p>KWin now supports ICC profiles: In display settings you can set one for each screen, and KWin will use that to adjust the colors accordingly. The Plasma 6 beta is already shipping with that implementation in KWin, and with a few additional steps you can play most HDR capable games in the Wayland session. ↫ Xaver Hugl I’ll admit colour management and HDR is a bit outside my wheelhouse, but I do know both are essentially vital for quite a few digital professions, and that support for them on Wayland specifically has been subpar or missing entirely.

<h2 id="white-house-says-it-is-preparing-new-proposal-to-free-american-journalist-jailed-in-russia">White House Says It Is Preparing New Proposal to Free American Journalist Jailed in Russia</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The White House said Thursday that it is preparing a new proposal to Russia to secure the release of journalist Evan Gershkovich and another jailed American.</p>
<p>“We’re working hard to see what we can do to get another proposal that might be more successful,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters. The Kremlin rejected a previous proposal.</p>
<p>Wall Street Journal reporter Gershkovich has been imprisoned since March on espionage charges that he, his employer and the U.S. government vehemently deny. Gershkovich’s jailing underscores Moscow’s years-long crackdown on press freedom, experts say.</p>
<p>The other American is Paul Whelan, a former U.S. Marine who was arrested in Moscow in 2018 and is currently serving a 16-year sentence on spying charges that he and the U.S. government deny.</p>
<p>“We’re always heartened to see signs that the government is working on Evan and Paul’s release. We hope very much that those efforts will bear fruit soon,” Paul Beckett, an assistant editor at the Journal, told VOA. Beckett is leading the newspaper’s campaign to secure Gershkovich’s release.</p>
<p>The news from the White House came one day after Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington is “very actively working” on securing the release of Gershkovich and Whelan.</p>
<p>“With regard to Russia and Evan and Paul Whelan, all I can say is this: We are very actively working on it, and we will leave no stone unturned to see if we can’t find the right way to get them home, and to get them home as soon as possible,” Blinken said during a year-end news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The State Department said earlier this month that Russia rejected a “substantial” proposal to free Gershkovich and Whelan.</p>
<p>Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow wants “to reach an agreement” with Washington on the release of Gershkovich and Whelan.</p>
<p>“We want to reach an agreement, and these agreements must be mutually acceptable and must suit both sides. We have contacts with our American partners in this regard, and there is an ongoing dialogue,” Putin said in his first public remarks on Gershkovich.</p>
<p>The Journal reported in September that Moscow is seeking the return of Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov, currently jailed in Germany, possibly in exchange for Gershkovich and Whelan.</p>
<p>In announcing a prisoner exchange with Venezuela on Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that his administration will continue to prioritize freeing detained Americans.</p>
<p>“We also remain deeply focused on securing the release of the hostages in Gaza and wrongfully detained Americans around the world, including Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan,” Biden said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Poynter Institute on Thursday named Gershkovich its Media Person of the Year.</p>
<p>“Gershkovich represents the dangers of being a journalist, but also provides inspiration, showing there are those willing to dedicate their lives to shining a light on the truth for the entire world to see,” Poynter said in announcing the distinction.</p>
<p>Gershkovich is set to remain in pretrial detention until at least January 30 while he waits for a trial. He faces up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Absent from these recent statements from top U.S. leaders about freeing Gershkovich and Whelan, however, was a mention of journalist Alsu Kurmasheva. The dual U.S.-Russian national has been jailed in Russia since October.</p>
<p>A Prague-based editor at VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Kurmasheva stands accused of failing to register as a foreign agent and spreading false information about the Russian military. Kurmasheva and her employer reject the charges, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 15 years.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva’s family and employer, as well as press freedom groups, have for weeks called on the U.S. State Department to declare her wrongfully detained, which would open up additional resources to help secure her release.</p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson previously told VOA that it “continuously reviews the circumstances surrounding the detentions of U.S. nationals overseas, including those in Russia, for indicators that they are wrongful.”</p>
<p>Both Gershkovich and Whelan have been declared wrongfully detained.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva traveled to Russia in May for a family emergency. When she tried to leave the country in June, her passports were confiscated and she was waiting for them to be returned when she was detained in October.</p>
<p>The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.</p>

<h2 id="icbm-test-may-soon-bring-all-of-us-within-north-korean-nuclear-range">ICBM Test May Soon Bring All of US Within North Korean Nuclear Range</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington  — North Korea’s launch of a Hwasong-18 this week shows it may soon have a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile that can target any part of the United States, analysts say.</p>
<p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said Monday’s test “of the most powerful ICBM” demonstrated the reliability of the country’s nuclear strategic force. He added that Pyongyang will not hesitate to strike back if provoked, the state-run KCNA reported Thursday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, U.S. B-1B and South Korean and Japanese fighter jets conducted joint aerial drills off the South Korean island of Jeju in what South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff described as a show of force in response to the ICBM test.</p>
<p>Monday’s ICBM launch followed a test of a short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) the previous day, making this the third consecutive year to end with North Korean missile tests.</p>
<p>It was Pyongyang’s fifth ICBM test of 2023 and third Hwasong-18 launch, following tests in April and July.</p>
<p>Ankit Panda, a senior fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said, “The Hwasong-18 program appears to now have transitioned into operational exercises, indicating that the missile may be closer to being commissioned formally into the country’s strategic forces.”</p>
<p>He said that aside from “minor modifications to the launcher, there doesn’t appear to be anything technically novel about this latest missile, suggesting that they’re looking to evaluate its performance under operational conditions.”</p>
<p>The missile Kim lauded as “the most powerful” reached a maximum altitude of 6,000 km and traveled a distance of 1,000 km. Analysts said it could carry a nuclear warhead and if launched at a normal trajectory, its range could be over 15,000 km — far enough to reach any part of the United States.</p>
<p>However, that “doesn’t necessarily mean that it is operational to the standard that we would hold,” said David Schmerler, senior research associate who focuses on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.</p>
<p>“As long as it doesn’t blow up prior to launch, gets up in the air, and goes a certain distance,” Pyongyang could consider the missile as working, he said. “But there are other things that go into it as well,” such as whether it could reliably strike a far-distant target.</p>
<p>The day Pyongyang launched the ICBM, Pak Myong Ho, its vice minister of foreign affairs, held talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in China, according to Wang Wenbin, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson.</p>
<p>South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lim Soo-suk called on China during a news briefing the next day to play a constructive role in persuading Pyongyang to end its destabilizing actions.</p>
<p>Robert Rapson, formerly charge d’affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said while Beijing could rein in Pyongyang’s missile program, it “chooses not to” because it does not see the missile launches as “a direct threat.”</p>
<p>“Moreover, it serves Beijing’s interest in the ongoing rivalry or competition with the U.S. and its allies,” Rapson said.</p>
<p>However, Sydney Seiler, who dealt with North Korea issues at the U.S. National Intelligence Council in 2022-23, told VOA he believes Pyongyang is “not going to refrain from advancing” its weapons program “out of China’s concerns.”</p>
<p>Gary Samore, a former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said he sees this week’s missile tests in part as “a political signal” to protest deepening security cooperation between Washington and Seoul.</p>
<p>The U.S. and South Korea held their second Nuclear Consultative Group session in Washington on December 15, and the U.S. reaffirmed its commitment to use the full range of its hardware, including nuclear weapons, to defend Seoul.</p>
<p>On December 17, the U.S. nuclear-powered submarine USS Missouri arrived at the South Korean port of Busan, according to the Seoul-based news agency Yonhap. That was the same day as the North Korean SRBM test, which traveled 570 km, far enough to have reached Busan.</p>
<p>“Whenever we send some sort of high-value asset to the region, North Korea often reacts” with missile launches, said Ken Gause, a senior adversary analytics specialist at the Virginia-based Center for Naval Analyses.</p>
<p>“There’s a possibility that North Korea was trying to demonstrate” that its SRBM “has the capability” to strike the USS Missouri during a crisis.</p>

<h2 id="white-house-biden-will-focus-on-turbulent-international-environment-in-2024">White House: Biden Will Focus on ‘Turbulent’ International Environment in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — As 2023 closes with violence in Gaza, a war in Ukraine and tension between the world’s largest powers, VOA White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara spoke with National Security Council spokesman John Kirby on foreign policy challenges in the year ahead.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: On Gaza, the president is losing a lot of goodwill from Arab states, Muslim states and the Global South at the U.N. At home, it’s costing him votes from Muslims, Arabs, progressive Democrats and young voters. At what point would the president decide that his support for Israel is costing him too much?</p>
<p>John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications: The president understands that there’s strong feelings on all sides here. People have many different views about what’s going on between Israel and Hamas and the struggle in Gaza. He respects that, he appreciates that, and we’re reaching out to communities all over the country, and of course, the world, to get their perspectives.</p>
<p>We just had the national security adviser in the region, the secretary of defense and of course, Secretary of State [Antony] Blinken in just a week or so before that. We’re absolutely listening and trying to get a better understanding of all these different perspectives.</p>
<p>That said, no nation should have to live with the threat that Hamas poses to Israel. No nation should have to live with that next door. And what Israel went through on the seventh of October was one of the most deadly terrorist attacks they’ve ever experienced, if not the deadliest terrorist attack that they ever experienced. So, we’re going to make sure that they can continue to defend themselves, at the same time, urging them to be more precise, more careful, and more cautious in the execution of those military operations. Too many civilians have been killed, and the right number is zero.</p>
<p>VOA: On China, is the administration bracing for a more muscular posture from Beijing, particularly as it relates to Taiwan?</p>
<p>Kirby: I won’t talk about the diplomatic conversations that we’ve been having with our Chinese counterparts or the meeting between President Xi [Jinping] and President [Joe] Biden. I’ll just tell you that we don’t believe that the status quo over the Taiwan Strait, tense as it may be, should be resolved unilaterally. Certainly, those tensions should not be resolved by force, and everything that the president is doing with respect to our relationships in the Indo-Pacific, including with the PRC [People’s Republic of China], is designed to prevent that outcome.</p>
<p>VOA: On Venezuela, should we expect a U.S. recognition of the Nicolas Maduro government in 2024?</p>
<p>Kirby: I don’t have anything like that to preview. We’re focused on monitoring as closely as we can President Maduro’s commitments to the electoral proposals that he promised to implement in keeping with, and with the support of, opposition parties. We want to see the democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people respected and recognized and pursued.</p>
<p>VOA: This year, the U.S. secured hostage deals with Venezuela and also Iran. How would you respond to those who criticize the administration for negotiating with these regimes — one which is a state sponsor of terrorism, and the other one which you don’t consider to be legitimate?</p>
<p>Kirby: No apologies for working hard to get Americans that are wrongfully detained overseas back home with their families where they belong. Ten American families will now be able to spend the holidays together because of the work that this administration did with respect to Venezuela, and that we’re going to continue to do to get wrongfully detained Americans home.</p>
<p>VOA: As we approach the end of 2023, we may not be able to continue to support Ukraine’s fight against Russia. Twenty thousand people are dead in Gaza with no end in sight in fighting. The Houthis are attacking ships in the Red Sea. Xi Jinping is moving to take Taiwan. Kim Jong Un has ICBMs that may be able to reach the U.S. What does that say about President Biden, who ran on a campaign that he’s experienced on foreign policy?</p>
<p>Kirby: All those examples you just laid out are examples of how turbulent this international environment is. As the president has said, we’re at an inflection point, and democracy is under threat all around the world. Some of the examples that you just laid out are examples of exactly that — Israel, Ukraine in particular.</p>
<p>We’ve seen a threat to democracy here on our own home shores just up the road here, on Capitol Hill. We are at a very significant moment in history. And when you’re at a moment like that, you want a leader. You want a commander in chief who understands these relationships, who knows that history, who can pick up the phone and call a foreign leader and try to get something done — as we did in recent days to get Americans home out of Venezuela, as we did to try to get additional humanitarian assistance into Gaza over the objections of some in the Israeli government. That’s what President Biden brings to this very turbulent world here that we’re seeing.</p>
<p>VOA: Can we expect the same kind of commitment and focus from President Biden next year, an election year?</p>
<p>Kirby: One hundred percent.</p>

<h2 id="us-bans-pentagon-from-using-chinese-port-logistics-platform">US Bans Pentagon From Using Chinese Port Logistics Platform</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Congress has passed legislation that would ban the Pentagon from using any seaport in the world that relies on a Chinese logistics platform known as LOGINK.</p>
<p>LOGINK, by tracking cargo and ship movements, lets Beijing monitor America’s military supply chain, which relies on commercial ports, according to sponsors Senator Tom Cotton and Representative Michelle Steel.</p>
<p>Their amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal 2024 also bans federal funding of any port that uses LOGINK. The spending bill passed December 14 and the LOGINK ban goes into effect six months after the bill is signed. President Joe Biden has not yet signed the NDAA.</p>
<p>Steel, in an email interview with VOA, called LOGINK’s threat “very serious” because it operates under the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing already has investments in about 100 ports in more than 60 nations.</p>
<p>The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC), which monitors the national security implications of U.S.-China trade, said in a September 2022 report, “LOGINK’s visibility into global shipping and supply chains could also enable the Chinese government to identify U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities and to track shipments of U.S. military cargo on commercial freight.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Pentagon’s U.S. Transportation Command told VOA via email on Tuesday, “USTRANSCOM understands the visibility into global logistics China has through their Belt and Road Initiative and related public-private arrangements.”</p>
<p>LOGINK partners with more than 20 ports worldwide, including six in Japan, five in South Korea and one in Malaysia. There are also at least nine across Europe and three in the Middle East. There are no LOGINK port contracts in the U.S., according to the commission’s report, which says Beijing subsidizes the free platform.</p>
<p>Under the NDAA, Congress must commission a study of how foreign influence at the 15 largest American container ports “could affect” U.S. national and economic security.</p>
<p>“Chinese companies are operating ports in the United States, which poses a national security risk to our critical infrastructure. This report will spur policy to counter that risk,” said Ivan Kanapathy, who served on former President Donald Trump’s National Security Council as director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia. He is now a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. </p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred VOA to China’s General Administration of Customs for comment, but an email inquiry received no reply.</p>
<p>‘Major step’ by Congress</p>
<p>Michael Wessel, an original member of the USCC who helped write the report, now heads a consulting firm, the Wessel Group. He told VOA the legislation is “a major step taken by Congress to begin to address the challenge of the threat posed by LOGINK.”</p>
<p>Wessel and others say an alternative to LOGINK needs to be developed. </p>
<p>Gabe Collins, a fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy and a former Department of Defense China analyst, told VOA he’s not seen an alternative to LOGLINK “that can operate at that scale.”</p>
<p>Collins estimates that LOGINK collects data on as much as half of all global shipping capacity — through contracts with ports and data sharing agreements with existing logistics networks.</p>
<p>He said the U.S. ban sends a “demand signal” telling the marketplace it must invent an alternative to LOGINK, though he said it could take as long as five years to develop one.</p>
<p>Washington’s new ban also requires the secretary of state to begin negotiations with allies and partners to remove LOGINK from their ports. Compliance must begin in six months.</p>
<p>It is unclear how the amendment will affect ports worldwide used by the U.S. military. The International Association of Ports and Harbors told VOA it would need more time to survey its members on how they might respond to the new legislation.</p>
<p>Randall Schriver, former assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs,  said that while working with the USCC in April, he discovered some European leaders were in the dark about LOGINK and its monitoring capacity.</p>
<p>“These were administrative matters handled at a lower level, and they were going with a cheap but good product without thinking through all of the possible implications,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="tcapture-replication-server-1.0-beta">TCapture Replication Server 1.0 Beta</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
We are pleased to announce the upcoming release of TCapture Replication Server 1.0 Beta We are currently releasing a beta version for community testing.
</p>
<p>
TCapture is a bidirectional multi master replication server based on a ‘capture and apply’ asynchronous replica engine
</p>
<p>
Key Features
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Transactional. SQL are captured transactionally, can be coupled with surrounding business logic.
</li>
<li>
Efficient. It capture transactions for replication from Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) instead of using triggers, eliminating overhead on master databases and significantly reduces latency
</li>
<li>
Flexible. No limits on the number of producers or consumers, but complexity increases
</li>
<li>
Reliable. Transactions are stored in PostgreSQL database – this adds the benefit of write ahead logging and crash recovery.
</li>
<li>
Transparent. No impact on the applications already running on that database, since both engine and ‘store database’ can run separate from production databases.
</li>
<li>
Easy to use. Simple to set up and configure, is an effective tool for data replication between different Postgres versions
</li>
<li>
Open Source. No licensing fees, but occasionally you’ll have to get your hands dirty
</li>
</ul>

<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
Water distribution systems in hotels have been related to outbreaks caused by <italic>Legionella</italic> spp. Certain measures, including disinfection by chlorination, maintaining increased temperatures are usually undertaken to prevent <italic>Legionella</italic> outbreaks. However, these preventive strategies are not always effective, since there are several factors (e.g., synergistic interactions with other microbes, physico-chemical factors, biofilm formation, availability of nutrients) that promote survival and proliferation of the pathogen in water pipes., Accordingly, there is a need of a holistic approach in development of preventive models for <italic>Legionella</italic> outbreaks associated with water distribution systems.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Water samples were collected from hotel water systems and were tested for the presence of <italic>Legionella</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, total coliforms, total mesophilic count and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. In each sample, temperature and chlorine were also tested. Other epidemiological factors were additionally recorded including number of rooms, stars, proximity of sampling point to the boiler, etc. Data were processed by generalized linear analysis, and modeling based on logistic regression analysis to identify independent predictive factors associated with the presence of <italic>Legionella</italic> in hotel water systems.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
According to the generalized linear model, temperature affected (p&lt;0.05) the presence of <italic>Legionella</italic> regardless of the species or the water supply (hot or cold). Additionally, opportunistic (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) or non-opportunistic (<italic>E. coli</italic>, coliforms) pathogens were significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with the presence of all <italic>Legionella</italic> species. Temperature also exhibited a positive effect to all pathogens tested except for <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> according to the linear model. Multivariate analysis showed that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, total coliforms, HPC and temperature had a statistically significant effect on the presence of <italic>Legionella</italic>. Based on a binomial model, cold water had a positive effect on <italic>Legionella</italic>. Type of sampling and proximity of the sample to the boiler seemed to pose different effect on <italic>Legionella</italic> depending on the cfu/L. The number of hotel stars and rooms did not appear to have any effect in all tested models.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
Collectively, these results indicate the need for development of individualized water safety plans tailored by the presence of other microbiological agents, and unique physico-chemical factors, which could facilitate the survival of <italic>Legionella</italic>.in hotel water systems.

<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
<italic>Mycobacterium orygis</italic>, a member of MTBC has been identified in higher numbers in the recent years from animals of South Asia. Comparative genomics of this important zoonotic pathogen is not available which can provide data on the molecular difference between other MTBC members. Hence, the present study was carried out to isolate, whole genome sequence <italic>M. orygis</italic> from different animal species (cattle, buffalo and deer) and to identify molecular marker for the differentiation of <italic>M. orygis</italic> from other MTBC members.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Isolation and whole genome sequencing of <italic>M. orygis</italic> was carried out for 9 samples (4 cattle, 4 deer and 1 buffalo) died due to tuberculosis. Comparative genomics employing 53 genomes (44 from database and 9 newly sequenced) was performed to identify SNPs, spoligotype, pangenome structure, and region of difference.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
<italic>M. orygis</italic> was isolated from water buffalo and sambar deer which is the first of its kind report worldwide. Comparative pangenomics of all <italic>M. orygis</italic> strains worldwide (n= 53) showed a closed pangenome structure which is also reported for the first time. Pairwise SNP between TANUVAS_2, TANUVAS_4, TANUVAS_5, TANUVAS_7 and NIRTAH144 was less than 15 indicating that the same <italic>M. orygis</italic> strain may be the cause for infection. Region of difference prediction showed absence of RD7, RD8, RD9, RD10, RD12, RD301, RD315 in all the <italic>M. orygis</italic> analyzed. SNPs in virulence gene, PE35 was found to be unique to <italic>M. orygis</italic> which can be used as marker for identification.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The present study is yet another supportive evidence that <italic>M. orygis</italic> is more prevalent among animals in South Asia and the zoonotic potential of this organism needs to be evaluated.

<h2 id="immune-response-and-severity-of-omicron-ba.5-reinfection-among-individuals-previously-infected-with-different-sars-cov-2-variants">Immune response and severity of Omicron BA.5 reinfection among individuals previously infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
COVID-19 continues to spread worldwide, with an increasing number of individuals experiencing reinfection after recovering from their primary infection. However, the nature and progression of this infection remain poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the immune response, severity and outcomes of Omicron BA.5 reinfection among individuals previously infected with different SARS-CoV-2 variants.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We enrolled 432 COVID-19 cases who had experienced prior infection with the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus, Delta variant or Omicron BA.2 variant between January 2020 and May 2022 in Guangzhou, China. All cases underwent follow-up from March to April, 2023 through telephone questionnaires and clinical visits. Nasal lavage fluid and peripheral blood were collected to assess anti-RBD IgA, anti-RBD IgG and virus-specific IFN-γ secreting T cells.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Our study shows that 73.1%, 56.7% and 12.5% of individuals with a prior infection of the ancestral virus, Delta or Omicron BA.2 variant experienced reinfection with the BA.5 variant, respectively. Fever, cough and sore throat were the most common symptoms of BA.5 reinfection, with most improving within one week and none progressing to a critical condition. Compared with individuals without reinfection, reinfected patients with a prior Delta infection exhibited elevated levels of nasal anti-RBD IgA, serum anti-RBD IgG and IFN-γ secreting T cells, whereas there was no noticeable change in reinfected individuals with a prior BA.2 infection.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
These results suggest that BA.5 reinfection is common but severe outcomes are relatively rare. Reinfection with a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant different from the prior infection may induce a more robust immune protection, which should be taken into account during vaccine development.

<h2 id="herpesvirus-reactivation-in-respiratory-tract-is-associated-with-increased-mortality-of-severe-pneumonia-patients-and-their-respiratory-microbiome-dysbiosis">Herpesvirus reactivation in respiratory tract is associated with increased mortality of severe pneumonia patients and their respiratory microbiome dysbiosis</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Severe pneumonia (SP) is a respiratory tract disease that seriously threatens human health. The herpesvirus detected in patients, especially with severe and immunodeficient diseases, is gradually attracting the attention of clinical doctors. However, little is known about the effect of herpesvirus on the prognosis of SP patients and the pulmonary microbial community. Here, we retrospectively analyzed respiratory samples from 45 SP patients detected by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). A total of five types of herpesviruses were detected, with <italic>Human alphaherpesvirus 1</italic> (HHV-1) in 19 patients, <italic>Human betaherpesvirus 5</italic> (CMV) in 7 patients, <italic>Human betaherpesvirus 7</italic> (HHV-7) in 6 patients, <italic>Human alphaherpesvirus 2</italic> (HHV-2) in 5 patients, and <italic>Human gammaherpesvirus 4</italic> (EBV) in 4 patients. Further analysis showed that the mortality of the herpesvirus-positive group was significantly higher than that of the negative group. The results also showed that HHV-1 was significantly associated with the prognosis of SP patients, while the other herpesviruses did not have a significant difference in patient mortality. A comparison of the microbial community characteristics of SP patients showed a significant difference in beta-diversity between herpesvirus-positive and negative groups. Species difference analysis showed that the herpesvirus-positive group was related to more conditional pathogens, such as <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia cepacia</italic>. In summary, our results suggest that the presence of herpesvirus is associated with the mortality of SP patients. Furthermore, enrichment of conditional pathogens in the respiratory tract of herpesvirus-positive SP patients may be a potential reason for the increased mortality.

<h2 id="the-metaproteome-of-the-gut-microbiota-in-pediatric-patients-affected-by-covid-19">The metaproteome of the gut microbiota in pediatric patients affected by COVID-19</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Introduction
</title>
<p>
The gut microbiota (GM) play a significant role in the infectivity and severity of COVID-19 infection. However, the available literature primarily focuses on adult patients and it is known that the microbiota undergoes changes throughout the lifespan, with significant alterations occurring during infancy and subsequently stabilizing during adulthood. Moreover, children have exhibited milder symptoms of COVID-19 disease, which has been associated with the abundance of certain protective bacteria. Here, we examine the metaproteome of pediatric patients to uncover the biological mechanisms that underlie this protective effect of the GM.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
We performed nanoliquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry on a high resolution analytical platform, resulting in label free quantification of bacterial protein groups (PGs), along with functional annotations via COG and KEGG databases by MetaLab-MAG. Additionally, taxonomic assignment was possible through the use of the lowest common ancestor algorithm provided by Unipept software.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A COVID-19 GM functional dissimilarity respect to healthy subjects was identified by univariate analysis. The alteration in COVID-19 GM function is primarily based on bacterial pathways that predominantly involve metabolic processes, such as those related to tryptophan, butanoate, fatty acid, and bile acid biosynthesis, as well as antibiotic resistance and virulence.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Discussion
</title>
<p>
These findings highlight the mechanisms by which the pediatric GM could contribute to protection against the more severe manifestations of the disease in children. Uncovering these mechanisms can, therefore, have important implications in the discovery of novel adjuvant therapies for severe COVID-19.

<h2 id="metagenomic-next-generation-sequencing-for-detecting-aspergillosis-pneumonia-in-immunocompromised-patients-a-retrospective-study">Metagenomic next-generation sequencing for detecting Aspergillosis pneumonia in immunocompromised patients: a retrospective study</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-22, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Purpose
</title>
<p>
The identification of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) remains a challenging task due to the difficulty of nucleic acid extraction. The objective of this study was to determine whether mNGS could provide an accurate and efficient method for detecting invasive pulmonary <italic>aspergillosis</italic> (IPA) in immunocompromised patients (ICP).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
A total of 133 ICP admitted to the ICU between January 2020 and September 2022 were enrolled in the study, of which 46 were diagnosed with IPA and 87 were non-IPA cases. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed for the presence of <italic>Aspergillosis</italic> and other co-pathogens using mNGS, and its diagnostic performance was compared to conventional microbial tests (CMTs) that included smear, cultures, serum and BALF galactomannan (GM) test. Clinical composite diagnosis was used as the reference standard
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
mNGS had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 82.6%, 97.7%, and 92.5%, respectively, in diagnosing IPA. These findings were comparable to those of the combination of multiple CMTs. Interestingly, the sensitivity of mNGS was superior to that of any single CMT method, as demonstrated by comparisons with smears (8.7%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), culture (39.1%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), serum GM (23.9%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and BALF GM (69.6%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.031). mNGS was capable of accurately distinguish strains of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> genus, with a consistency of 77.8% with culture. Furthermore, mNGS also identified <italic>A. fumigatus</italic>, <italic>A. flavus</italic>, <italic>A. terrestris</italic>, <italic>A. oryzae</italic> and <italic>Mucor</italic> spp. in culture-negative cases. The sequencing reads of <italic>Aspergillus</italic> by mNGS exhibited extensive variation, ranging from 11 to1702. A positive correlation was observed between the optical density index of BALF GM and unique reads by mNGS (r = 0.607, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) in BALF-GM positive patients. Notably, mNGS was able to diagnose 35 out of 37 cases with mixed infection, with <italic>P. jirovecii</italic> and <italic>cytomegalovirus</italic> being the most common co-pathogens.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
mNGS presents a feasible and remarkably sensitive approach for detecting <italic>Aspergillus</italic> in ICP, thereby serving as a valuable adjunctive tool to CMT. Furthermore, mNGS’s ability to accurately identify fungal species and co-pathogens can assist in guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

<h2 id="chinese-chip-import-concerns-prompt-us-to-review-semiconductor-supply-chain">Chinese Chip Import Concerns Prompt US to Review Semiconductor Supply Chain</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Department of Commerce said Thursday that it would launch a survey of the U.S. semiconductor supply chain and national defense industrial base to address national security concerns from Chinese-sourced chips. </p>
<p>The survey aims to identify how U.S. companies are sourcing so-called legacy chips — current-generation and mature-node semiconductors — as the department moves to award nearly $40 billion in subsidies for semiconductor chip manufacturing. </p>
<p>The department said the survey, which will begin in January, aims to “reduce national security risks posed by” China and will focus on the use and sourcing of Chinese-manufactured legacy chips in the supply chains of critical U.S. industries. </p>
<p>A report released by the department on Thursday said China had provided the Chinese semiconductor industry with an estimated $150 billion in subsidies in the last decade, creating “an unlevel global playing field for U.S. and other foreign competitors.” </p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, “Over the last few years, we’ve seen potential signs of concerning practices from [China] to expand their firms’ legacy chip production and make it harder for U.S. companies to compete.” </p>
<p>China’s embassy in Washington said Thursday that the United States “has been stretching the concept of national security, abusing export control measures, engaging in discriminatory and unfair treatment against enterprises of other countries, and politicizing and weaponizing economic and sci-tech issues.” </p>
<p>Raimondo said last week that she expected her department to make about a dozen semiconductor chip funding awards within the next year, including multibillion-dollar announcements that could drastically reshape U.S. chip production. Her department made the first award from the program on December 11. </p>
<p>The Commerce Department said the survey would also help promote a level playing field for legacy chip production. </p>
<p>“Addressing non-market actions by foreign governments that threaten the U.S. legacy chip supply chain is a matter of national security,” Raimondo added. </p>
<p>U.S.-headquartered companies account for about half of the global semiconductor revenue but face intense competition supported by foreign subsidies, the department said. </p>
<p>Its report said the cost of manufacturing semiconductors in the United States may be “30-45% higher than the rest of the world,” and it called for long-term support for domestic fabrication construction. </p>
<p>It added that the U.S. should enact “permanent provisions that incentivize steady construction and modernization of semiconductor fabrication facilities, such as the investment tax credit scheduled to end in 2027.”</p>

<h2 id="american-fuel-economy-just-hit-a-record-thanks-to-evs-and-hybrids">American Fuel Economy Just Hit a Record, Thanks to EVs and Hybrids</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDkwMjY3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzYyOTEyMX0.aSCgAyBtsiV5HKjV2oPy-33h-vgKv3NOBTrLp5NHOSw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is out with its <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-12/420r23033.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual Automotive Trends Report</a> for 2022 model-year vehicles, and the numbers are some of the best it’s seen. Average emissions are at a record low and fuel economy is at a record high — and according to preliminary 2023-model-year data, those trends will continue into the new year.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the EPA says average real-world CO2 emissions for new vehicles sold in 2022 dropped by 10 grams of carbon dioxide per mile for an average of 337 g/mile, the lowest the agency has recorded. On the other side, fuel economy averages are at 26 miles per gallon, an improvement of 0.6 MPG and another record high for new vehicles sold.
</p>
<p>
Of the five categories of vehicles tested, four are the most fuel efficient the agency has seen since its inception, with crossovers (what the EPA classifies as “car SUVs”) showing the biggest drop in emissions at 27 g/mile, followed by pickup trucks, sedans/wagons, minivans, and SUVs.
</p>
<p>
The not-so-good-news is the EPA also recorded its highest number of SUVs, pickups, and minivans/vans sold since 1975, accounting for a whopping 63% of new vehicles that rolled off dealer lots. And across the board, 2022 vehicles were also the heaviest and largest ever sold.
</p>
<p>
This is primarily due to two things: First, automaker safety is at an all-time high, swelling cars with better crumple zones, dozens of airbags, and scads of active safety systems. Second, Americans just like big vehicles with more power — what the EPA calls “market trends.” That likely won’t change with 2023’s numbers.
</p>
<p>
Thankfully, there will be more EVs and hybrids coming to market, which should help to offset some of the emissions. Electrics helped reduce average emissions by 22 g/mile in 2022 and increased overall fuel economy by 1.2%, and projections for the next report show an even bigger boost to 26.9 MPG in 2023.

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Advertisements are a part of our lives, including our digital ones. They are in the websites we browse, the search results we receive, and the online news we read. Tired of receiving so many ads, some users try to avoid them by installing an adblocker. But is this a legal practice? Is using adblockers an act of restricting market autonomy, or do they help achieve user freedom? Imagine a scenario where website owners hold copyright over their websites, including whatever ads they place, and could effectively sue for copyright infringement if users were to remove or suppress ads when visiting these websites. This hypothetical situation would enable any website copyright holder to use the legal system to stop any ordinary user on the internet who tries to bypass these ads. This would lead to an internet where unsolicited information and advertisements are imposed on users. Fortunately, recent court decisions have at least prevented this hypothetical from becoming a reality in Germany. ↫ FSFE Good. My position has always been clear: your computer, your rules.

<p class="drop-caps">
Katherine Ricke, a University of California at San Diego sustainability professor, turned to face the roomful of attentive scientists at the American Geophysical Union a few weeks ago. In any other year, she would have been about to break one of climate science’s biggest taboos.
</p>
<p>
“Geoscientists know very well at this point that solar geoengineering is not a very good substitute for emissions reductions,” she said. “The question that comes next, then, is, <em>Is solar geoengineering a complement to mitigation?</em>”
</p>
<p>
The answer, she then argued, was yes. While cutting greenhouse gas emissions might bring down the planet’s temperature in the long term, she said, it would not do so immediately. But spraying sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere was pretty cheap, and it could quickly help relieve the planet’s fever. “Solar geoengineering has a rapid but temporary effect on global temperatures, while the effect of emissions reduction is deferred but persistent,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Ricke went on to ask whether the economics of solar geoengineering made sense — and about its risks. Would it deprive other important efforts of research funding? Probably not. Could it encourage the public to procrastinate on cutting emissions? Maybe yes.
</p>
<p>
Yet perhaps the presentation’s biggest surprise — for people who have long thought about the issue — was that nobody in the audience of normal climate scientists gasped. Nobody shooed Ricke out of the room or told her that her talk didn’t belong in a session devoted to achieving net zero — that is, to climate <em>mitigation,</em> to reducing carbon pollution, not blotting out its effects.
</p>
<p>
To get a sense of what American climate scientists are talking about, you can do a lot worse than attending the annual fall meeting of the AGU, where more than 20,000 scientists come to network, present new research, and gossip about their superiors. This year, AGU was held in the cavernous Moscone Center in San Francisco. The arrival of tens of thousands of people immediately broke the city’s post-pandemic downtown; Starbucks ran out of breakfast sandwiches and every restaurant within a quarter mile of the conference site was jammed before the 8:30 a.m. sessions.
</p>
<p>
AGU is almost always held, for some nonsensical reason, at roughly the same time as the <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/cop28-global-stocktake-climate-tech" target="_self">annual United Nations climate conference</a>, and the two events have a lot in common: They are bazaars, free-for-alls, half salon and half trade show, and each way too big for any one person to see. Yet by keen attention to sounds and signals, one can detect a <em>vibe </em>at both events<em>. </em>The vibe of this year’s AGU was clear: Geoengineering is here to stay.
</p>
<p>
This sincere interest in geoengineering and climate modification represents <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/this-is-the-end-of-climate-science" target="_self">a broader shift</a> in climate science from observation to intervention. It also represents a huge change for a field that used to regard any interference with the climate system — short of cutting greenhouse gas emissions — as verboten. “There is a growing realization that [solar radiation management] is not a taboo anymore,” Dan Visioni, a Cornell climate professor, told me. “There was a growing interest from NASA, NOAA, the national labs, that wasn’t there a year ago.”
</p>
<p>
At the highest level, this acceptance of geoengineering shows that scientists have seriously begun to imagine what will happen if humanity blows its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
</p>
<div class="horizontal-rule">

</div>
<p class="drop-caps">
Why the sudden embrace of geoengineering? Part of it is that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-carbon-removal-new-insights-in-climate-science" target="_self">has become increasingly insistent</a> that carbon removal is crucial — and opened the door to other once-taboo ideas.
</p>
<p>
But another part is that climate disasters seem to get bigger and bigger every year, and humanity seems to be growing more and more alarmed about them, yet no country plans to cut emissions fast enough to relieve global warming’s near-term dangers. 2023 was the warmest year in modern human history, but the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals remain far off. “It was always pretty clear that the kind of emissions reduction to stay below 1.5 [degrees Celsius] was never going to happen in any realistic scenario, but there was always a conviction that just by saying it was <em>physically</em> possible, it was going to inspire people into some kind of action,” Visioni said. “2023 has shown this to not be the case.”
</p>
<p>
Perhaps one more reason is that, for better or worse, geoengineering is already happening. Economists have long argued that stratospheric aerosol injection is so cheap that someone will eventually try to do it. Then, last year, Luke Iseman, a 39-year-old former employee of the startup incubator Y Combinator, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/24/1066041/a-startup-says-its-begun-releasing-particles-into-the-atmosphere-in-an-effort-to-tweak-the-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">claimed</a> to have conducted rogue experiments in western Mexico delivering reflective sulfur molecules to the atmosphere using weather balloons. It’s unclear whether this “move fast and break things”-styled effort actually reflected any meaningful sunlight back into space. What it did do was awaken the Mexican government to a regulatory arbitrage. It responded by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/18/23560446/mexico-ban-solar-geoengineering-make-sunsets-startup-experiments" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">banning</a> solar geoengineering.
</p>
<p>
Yet more serious attempts have been made at bringing geoengineering into the mainstream. In September, the Overshoot Commission, a panel of current and former world leaders — including an influential Chinese adviser and a former Canadian prime minister — <a href="https://www.overshootcommission.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recommended </a>that the world begin to seriously study solar geoengineering. And Congress recently <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/06/30/congressionally-mandated-report-on-solar-radiation-modification/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mandated</a> that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy study the technique — although the office’s resulting report also suggested that scientists are still treading carefully around it. Its hilariously curt title: “Congressionally-Mandated Report on Solar Radiation Modification.”
</p>
<p>
“The way that broader climate intervention has started to move into the mainstream has been kind of astounding,” said Shuchi Talati, a University of Pennsylvania scholar and former Energy Department official. “If you look at AGU of four or five years ago, if there was one [solar radiation management] panel, that was novel,” she told me. But this year, there were more panels and side conversations than ever. “You can feel it in the air that there was more interest.”
</p>
<p>
Ricke’s was far from the only geoengineering presentation in San Francisco this year. In a packed lunchtime session, Lisa Graumlich, AGU’s president, led a town hall about the organization’s <a href="https://www.agu.org/learn-about-agu/about-agu/ethics/ethical-framework-for-climate-intervention" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">draft proposal</a> on how to research climate intervention ethically. “Are we attempting to play God? Do we have the right to do this? What risks are we willing to accept? Or … do we have the right <em>not</em> to?” <a href="https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/people/cynthia-scharf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cynthia Scharf</a>, a former UN adviser who helped lead a Carnegie Foundation project on how the world could possibly govern geoengineering, told the room by video conference. The crowd wasn’t exactly rewarded for attending: After every panelist had finished going through their introductions, the audience only had time to ask two questions.
</p>
<p>
Across the hall, more than 60 people were talking about a different kind of climate intervention. For years, scientists have known that the stability of a few glaciers in West Antarctica could mean the difference between quasi-manageable amounts of sea-level rise this century and a rapid, catastrophic surge. So small groups of glaciologists have now started to ask whether those specific glaciers — such as <a href="https://thwaitesglacier.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Thwaites</a>, which holds a quadrillion gallons of water and is larger than Florida — could be engineered or modified somehow to slow their collapse.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps a berm <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/a-new-geo-engineering-proposal-to-stop-sea-level-rise/550214/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">could be built</a> on the seafloor, in front of each of the glaciers, in order to prevent warm water from eroding them. Or maybe holes could be drilled into the glaciers, allowing the warmth of their subsurface to be vented to the surface. Glacial scientists have already met twice this year — at the University of Chicago and later Stanford — to begin hashing out the idea.
</p>
<p>
Another approach — using ships to spray ocean water into the atmosphere, thereby brightening clouds and reflecting more sunlight into space — was also the subject of several events. One scholar, Chih-Chieh Jack Chen, showed research suggesting that brightening the clouds over just 5% of the ocean surface could cool the planet enough to meet the world’s temperature targets — but that the climatic ripple effects of doing so might simultaneously <em>raise</em> temperatures in Southeast Asia by even more than what global warming would do alone. Others presented work showing that cloud brightening might accidentally shut down the planet’s westerly trade winds — or even silence the Pacific Ocean’s El Niño oscillation.
</p>
<p>
Then there were the carbon removal people, who arrived by the tens and who seemed to have graduated to a less controversial (and possibly more remunerative) plane than geoengineering. Most scientists seem to have accepted that carbon dioxide removal, or CDR, will need to happen to at least some degree. “CDR is a given. People don’t even consider it to be geoengineering any more, which is what the CDR people have always wanted,” Visioni told me. <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/article/50686/new-analysis-outlines-national-opportunities-remove-carbon-dioxide-gigaton-scale" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A new Department of Energy report</a>, released during the conference, argues that by 2050, the United States might be able to suck 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere for a mere $130 billion a year, creating 440,000 jobs. In other scenarios — and not only those sponsored by the federal government — America seems likely to become the keystone of the global carbon removal industry, its vast geological capacity and fossil-fuel expertise giving it a competitive advantage.
</p>
<p>
In anticipation, venture capital and public-sector cash has surged into carbon removal, creating a corps of CDR startups with one foot in the geosciences and the other in Silicon Valley. Their employees were at AGU too, mingling in full force. “It was interesting how much industry was there — researchers at companies, even heads of companies,” Talati told me. “I’ve never really experienced that at AGU.” Employees from <a href="https://www.lithoscarbon.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Lithos</a>, <a href="https://www.heirloomcarbon.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heirloom</a>, <a href="https://www.carbon-direct.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Carbon Direct</a>, <a href="https://stripe.com/climate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Stripe</a>, and <a href="https://www.additionalventures.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Additional Ventures</a> all registered for the conference; in what might be an AGU first, scientists and technologists sipped cappuccinos and nibbled pastries during an early-morning confab at the Salesforce Tower, a few blocks from the official conference site. “AGU is not the place where you would have expected to find these kinds of people, even just for CDR, so it’s interesting that they’re there,” Visioni said.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing presented both a stark contrast and an inescapable mirror to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/cop28-dubai-sultan-al-jaber-controversy" target="_self">COP28</a>, where oil lobbyists roamed the grounds. Some environmental old-timers grumble that the UN climate conference has transformed from a diplomatic meeting into a trade show. But maybe there is now so much money and interest and public attention directed at the climate problem that any major gathering about it will take on shades of the commercial. There are lots of rich people with huge amounts of money who want to help do something about climate change. At the same time, the United States government is looking like less and less of a long-term reliable partner on climate research. Sooner or later, someone is going to try to do more serious geoengineering than releasing a few balloons in Mexico. Scientists have started preparing for that day. Is that smart? I don’t know. But it seems like a better strategy than feigned ignorance about where we’re headed.

<h2 id="giuliani-files-for-bankruptcy-after-losing-148-million-defamation-case">Giuliani Files for Bankruptcy After Losing $148 Million Defamation Case</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Rudy Giuliani has filed for bankruptcy, days after being ordered to pay $148 million in a defamation lawsuit brought by two former election workers in Georgia who said his targeting of them led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.</p>
<p>In his filing Thursday, the former New York City mayor listed nearly $153 million in existing or potential debts, including close to a million dollars in tax liabilities, money he owes his lawyers and many millions of dollars in potential legal judgments in lawsuits against him. He estimated his assets to be between $1 million and $10 million.</p>
<p>The biggest debt is the $148 million he was ordered to pay a week ago for making false statements about the election workers in Georgia stemming from the 2020 presidential contest.</p>
<p>Ted Goodman, a political adviser and spokesperson for Giuliani, a one-time Republican presidential candidate and high-ranking Justice Department official, said in a statement that the filing “should be a surprise to no one.”</p>
<p>“No person could have reasonably believed that Mayor Giuliani would be able to pay such a high punitive amount,” Goodman said. He said the bankruptcy filing would give Giuliani “the opportunity and time to pursue an appeal, while providing transparency for his finances under the supervision of the bankruptcy court, to ensure all creditors are treated equally and fairly throughout the process.”</p>
<p>But declaring bankruptcy likely will not erase the $148 million in damages a jury awarded to the former Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss. Bankruptcy law does not allow for the dissolution of debts that come from a “willful and malicious injury” inflicted on someone else.</p>
<p>Last week’s jury verdict was the latest and costliest sign of Giuliani’s mounting financial strain, exacerbated by investigations, lawsuits, fines, sanctions and damages related to his work helping then-President Donald Trump try to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
<p>In September, Giuliani’s former lawyer Robert Costello sued him for about $1.4 million in unpaid legal bills, alleging that Giuliani breached his retainer agreement by failing to pay invoices in full and a timely fashion. Giuliani has asked a judge to dismiss the case, claiming he never received the invoices at issue. The case is pending.</p>
<p>Costello represented Giuliani from November 2019 to this past July in matters ranging from an investigation into his business dealings in Ukraine, which resulted in an FBI raid on his home and office in April 2021, to state and federal investigations of his work in the wake of Trump’s 2020 election loss.</p>
<p>In August, the IRS filed a $549,435 tax lien against Giuliani for the 2021 tax year.</p>
<p>Copies were filed in Palm Beach County, Florida, where he owns a condominium, and New York, under the name of his outside accounting firm, Mazars USA LLP. That’s the same firm that Trump used for years before it dropped him as a client amid questions about his financial statements.</p>
<p>Giuliani, still somewhat popular among conservatives in the city he once ran, hosts a daily radio show in his hometown on a station owned by a local Republican grocery store magnate. Giuliani also hosts a nightly streaming show watched by a few hundred people on social media, which he calls “America’s Mayor Live.”</p>

<h2 id="chinese-still-largest-group-of-foreign-students-in-us">Chinese Still Largest Group of Foreign Students in US</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Students from China retained their position in 2023 as the largest group of international students in the United States. Despite a slight dip, they are still the leading country of origin for foreign students pursuing an education in the U.S.</p>
<p>The State Department granted more than 600,000 international student visas in fiscal 2023, which ended in September, the highest issuance since fiscal 2017. Among these, 289,526 visas were awarded to Chinese students, a decrease of 560 students compared to the previous year, according to State Department data. </p>
<p>In a November call with reporters about the agency’s 2023 visa operations, Julie Stufft, deputy assistant secretary for visa services in the State Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs, said in fiscal 2024, they will be focusing on shortening wait times. </p>
<p>“We’ve driven down wait times in all categories worldwide, except for one, and that category is first-time visitors,” she said wait times for the 20-plus different types of visa categories, including students, are almost non-existent.</p>
<p>As of December 4, the current wait times for student visa applicants from China vary at U.S. consulates across China from three to eight days.</p>
<p>For all other countries, Stufft said wait times have “gotten so low that we don’t necessarily have to track.” </p>
<p>For those who have gone through the process, like Shawn Zhan, an international student from China, the visa process is complex and “a lot of paperwork,” he told VOA. </p>
<p>“And just going through all the examinations, taking TOEFL, and also physical exams as well. Took a lot of vaccines. But I will say, it’s worth the trouble if you’re determined to come,” he said. The Test of English as a Foreign Language assesses the English language ability of a student who wants to enroll in an English-speaking university.</p>
<p>Zhan is in his last school year at the University of Maryland. He is graduating with a degree in economics and plans to stay in the U.S. for graduate school. </p>
<p>“I’m going to continue in the business school program in MSBA, the Master of Science in Business Analytics, for one more year,” he said.</p>
<p>According to the Open Doors 2023 Report on International Educational Exchange, the total number of students from China has decreased in the last three years mostly because of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>The 2022-2023 school year, with 289,526 Chinese students, is the lowest number since the 2013-2014 academic year when 274,439 Chinese students attended U.S. colleges and universities. The highest enrollment number for Chinese students was 372,532 in 2019-2020. </p>
<p>“However, this year we did see some modest increases in graduate students, non-degree, and students on [Optional Practical Training],” said Mirka Martel, head of research, evaluation and learning at the Institute of International Education.</p>
<p>Optional Practical Training allows international students to temporarily work in a field related to their academic focus.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In an email to VOA, a State Department official said on background that they have seen a two-year rebound of all international students in the United States following the pandemic, with more than a 14% percent growth in new enrollments this past year.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The official also said the U.S. government is “committed to facilitating legitimate travel to the United States while maintaining high national security standards.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Zhan said his first impression of the United States was “actually pretty nice,” and he had a host family who welcomed him.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“It definitely helped me a lot to adapt to the language, environment, and all that. … People are so nice,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="u.s.-battery-production-is-going-great-actually">U.S. Battery Production Is Going Great, Actually</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDg3OTYyNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTAxMjMzMH0.NjTSHpc2tdAVmqxx6yoA6Q6hCOBC3O9SqJN8GbORsqM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Back in April, the Environmental Protection Agency announced new vehicle emissions standards that seem poised to transform how our roads look. They’re so strict, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/12/1169269936/electric-vehicles-emission-standards-tailpipes-fuel-economy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NPR</a>, that up to 67% of new vehicles sold in 2032 would have to be electric to meet them.
</p>
<p>
Immediately, it looked like that would be a problem. The Inflation Reduction Act stipulates that, in order to be eligible for tax credits, electric vehicle components — including, crucially, the batteries — can’t be made by a country on the U.S.’s “foreign entities of concern” list. That rules out batteries made in China, which is, unfortunately, the world’s leader in battery manufacturing. As my colleague Emily Pontecorvo <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_self">recently pointed out</a>, that can lead to situations where nobody knows exactly which EVs qualify for tax credits to begin with. Without an increase in American battery manufacturing, we run the risk of Americans being either unwilling or unable to pay for the EVs that we’d need to hit those EPA standards.
</p>
<p>
But a new <a href="https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/2023-12/EDF%20Analysis%20on%20US%20Battery%20Capacity%2012.13.23%20final%20v3.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a> from the Environmental Defense Fund, provided exclusively to Heatmap, shows that things might actually be quite bright on that front. Battery manufacturers around the country — many of them automakers themselves — have announced over 1,000 gigawatt hours of U.S. battery production that’s slated to come online by 2028, far outpacing projected demand.
</p>
<center>
<p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="Chart of U.S. EV battery demand and announced battery production capacity." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="abed7c4bea8636374c05984fb9c8e48d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="fa821" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDkwMDY5Ny9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNTg0OTM2OX0.5k0_9kvb-vEng3ABDF4YXOCuWDbTuX-Kt37_MbJ5YI4/image.png?width=980"/> <small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Source: EDF</small>
</p>
</center>
<p>
“A really large investment has been made in the U.S. for domestic battery manufacturing, and many of these [announcements] came before the EPA announced their standards,” Ellen Robo, the author of the report, told me. “This is a transition that is following market trends and is not necessarily being driven by EPA standards, so I think that shows that the EPA’s standards are feasible.”
</p>
<p>
These findings are in line with a recent <a href="https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/dlm_uploads/2023/12/xchange_batteries_the_battery_domino_effect.pdf?stream=top" target="_blank">report</a> from RMI, which found that demand for EVs rose as battery technology improved, and that investments in battery factories outstrip investments in both solar and wind factories combined. Robo also points out that the announced production capacity line in the above chart will likely change; it usually takes about two years for a battery factory to go from announcement to production in the U.S., and Robo expects to see many more factories announced in the next few years, many of which could be churning out batteries by 2028. The caveat, of course, is that these are mostly just announcements; there could be delays or cancellations that change the timeline.
</p>
<p>
Still, this all bodes well for both automakers and customers. If automakers are able to source their critical minerals from places that aren’t foreign entities of concern — a requirement that kicks in for 2025 — the IRA tax credits will likely apply to their vehicles. Rather than us writing yet another story about the confusing state of EV tax credits a year from now, that means you could walk into a car dealership safe in the knowledge that you will get a hefty discount on the EV you’ve had your eye on.
</p>
<p>
But if you’re impatient, as Emily mentioned, you could always take advantage of the tax credit by <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/04/05/how-to-bypass-nearly-every-restriction-of-the-ev-tax-credit-by-leasing/" target="_blank">leasing</a> an EV in the meantime.

<h2 id="chatgpt-is-my-css-advisor">ChatGPT is my CSS advisor</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
People who don’t program must not have any idea how much of a boon ChatGPT is to us programmers.
</p>
<p>
I am doing <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> coding far in advance of my previous capability. When I know something is possible, but I haven’t the slightest idea how to specify it, I just ask, in my own words.
</p>
<p>
For example, a very common thing to want to do is to put a : after the text in the first column every row of a table.
</p>
<p>
So I <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/b19c1c8d-3e19-4039-86aa-803eb7cf46d6">asked ChatGPT</a> how to do it, in English, as I did above. This is what it came up with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>tr td:first-child::after {content: “:”;}</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you see it like that you can almost figure out what’s going on if you squint and close one eye.
</p>
<p>
And it works. I literally shrieked when it did.
</p>
<p>
Now I am the boss of CSS..
</p>
<p>
Nice.

<p>The generalist times in the media are over. Differentiation is the name of the game; “riches in niches” is the often-used motto. Digital success comes to those operating between the axes of quality and focus — if you don’t, you are either not distinctive enough or are not producing the best content in your chosen…</p>

Like many companies, Microsoft made a big bet on virtual &amp; augmented reality a few years back. But it looks like the company has decided that bet hasn’t really paid off. Windows Mixed Reality has been added to Microsoft’s list of deprecated features, and it will be removed from Windows altogether in an upcoming release. […]

The costs that go with owning a home — including mortgage payments, insurance and taxes — now eat up about 34% of the average wage nationwide, according to a report out today. That’s more than many lenders advise and comes as a wave of millennials and Gen Zers look toward homeownership. Also on the show: Apple watches, consumer confidence, and Turkey’s painfully interest rates.

<h2 id="pluralistic-a-year-in-illustration-2023-edition-21-dec-2023">Pluralistic: A year in illustration, 2023 edition (21 Dec 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links A year in illustration, 2023 edition: I amuse myself, at least. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading A year in illustration, 2023 edition (permalink) I am objectively very bad at visual art. I am bad at vision, period – I’m astigmatic, shortsighted, color blind, and often miss visual details others see. I can’t even draw a stick-figure. To top things off, I have cataracts in both eyes and my book publishing/touring schedule is so intense that I keep having to reschedule the surgeries. But despite my vast visual deficits, I thoroughly enjoy making collages for this blog. For many years now – decades – I’ve been illustrating my blog posts by mixing public domain and Creative Commons art with work that I can make a good fair use case for. As bad as art as I may be, all this practice has paid off. Call it unseemly, but I think I’m turning out some terrific illustrations – not all the time, but often enough. Last year, I rounded up my best art of the year: https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/25/a-year-in-illustration/ And I liked reflecting on the year’s art so much, I decided I’d do it again. Be sure to scroll to the bottom for some downloadables – freely usable images that I painstakingly cut up with the lasso tool in The Gimp. The original AD&amp;D hardcover cover art is seared into my psyche. For several years, there were few images I looked at so closely as these. When Hasbro pulled some world-beatingly sleazy stuff with the Open Gaming License, I knew just how to mod Dave Trampier’s ‘Eve Of Moloch’ from the cover of the Players’ Handbook. Thankfully, bigger nerds than me have identified all the fonts in the image, making the remix a doddle. https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/12/beg-forgiveness-ask-permission/#whats-a-copyright-exception Even though I don’t keep logs or collect any analytics, I can say with confidence that “Tiktok’s Enshittification” was the most popular thing I published on Pluralistic this year. I mixed some public domain Brother’s Grimm art, mixed with a classic caricature of Boss Tweed, and some very cheesy royalty-free/open access influencer graphics. One gingerbread cottage social media trap, coming up: https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys To illustrate the idea of overcoming walking-the-plank fear (as a metaphor for writing when it feels like you suck) I mixed public domain stock of a plank, a high building and legs, along with a procedurally generated Matrix “code waterfall” and a vertiginous spiral ganked from a Heinz Bunse photo of a German office lobby. https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/22/walking-the-plank/ Finding a tasteful way to illustrate a story about Johnson &amp; Johnson losing a court case after it spent a generation tricking women into dusting their vulvas with asbestos-tainted talcum was a challenge. The tulip (featured in many public domain images) was a natural starting point. I mixed it with Jesse Wagstaff’s image of a Burning Man dust-storm and Mike Mozart’s shelf-shot of a J&amp;J talcum bottle. https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/01/j-and-j-jk/#risible-gambit “Google’s Chatbot Panic” is about Google’s long history of being stampeded into doing stupid things because its competitors are doing them. Once it was Yahoo, now it’s Bing. Tenniel’s Tweedle Dee and Dum were a good starting point. I mixed in one of several Humpty Dumpty editorial cartoon images from 19th century political coverage that I painstakingly cut out with the lasso tool on a long plane-ride. This is one of my favorite Humpties, I just love the little 19th C businessmen trying to keep him from falling! I finished it off with HAL 9000’s glowing red eye, my standard ‘this is about AI’ image, which I got from Cryteria’s CC-licensed SVG. https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/16/tweedledumber/#easily-spooked Though I started writing about Luddites in my January, 2022 Locus column, 2023 was the Year of the Luddite, thanks to Brian Merchant’s outstanding Blood In the Machine: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/26/enochs-hammer/#thats-fronkonsteen When it came time to illustrate “Gig Work Is the Opposite of Steampunk,” I found a public domain weaver’s loft, and put one of Cryteria’s HAL9000 eyes in the window. Magpie Killjoy’s Steampunk Magazine poster, ‘Love the Machine, Hate the Factory,’ completed the look. https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/12/gig-work-is-the-opposite-of-steampunk/ For the “small, non-profit school” that got used as an excuse to bail out Silicon Valley Bank, I brought back Humpty Dumpty, mixing him with a Hogwartsian castle, a brick wall texture, and an ornate, gilded frame. I love how this one came out. This Humpty was made for the SVB bailout. https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/23/small-nonprofit-school/#north-country-school The RESTRICT Act would have federally banned Tiktok – a proposal that was both technically unworkable and unconstitutional. I found an early 20th century editorial cartoon depicting Uncle Sam behind a fortress wall that was keeping a downtrodden refugee family out of America. I got rid of most of the family, giving the dad a Tiktok logo head, and I put Cryteria’s HAL9000 eyes over each cannonmouth. Three Boss Tweed moneybag-head caricatures, adorned with Big Tech logos, rounded it out. https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/30/tik-tok-tow/#good-politics-for-electoral-victories When Flickr took decisive action to purge the copyleft trolls who’d been abusing its platform, I knew I wanted to illustrate this with Lucifer being cast out of heaven, and the very best one of those comes from John Milton, who is conveniently well in the public domain. The Flickr logo suggested a bicolored streaming-light-of-heaven motif that just made it. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/01/pixsynnussija/#pilkunnussija Old mainframe ads are a great source of stock for a “Computer Says No” image. And Congress being a public building, there are lots of federal (and hence public domain) images of its facade. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/04/cbo-says-no/#wealth-tax When I wrote about the Clarence Thomas/Harlan Crow bribery scandal, it was easy to find Mr. Kjetil Ree’s great image of the Supreme Court building. Thomas being a federal judge, it was easy to find a government photo of his head, but it’s impossible to find an image of him in robes at a decent resolution. Luckily, there are tons of other federal judges who’ve been photographed in their robes! Boss Tweed with the dollar-sign head was a great stand-in for Harlan Crow (no one knows what he looks like anyway). Gilding Thomas’s robes was a simple matter of superimposing a gold texture and twiddling with the layers. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/06/clarence-thomas/#harlan-crow “Gig apps trap reverse centaurs in wage-stealing Skinner boxes” is one of my best titles. This is the post where I introduce the idea of “twiddling” as part of the theory of enshittification, and explain how it relates to “reverse centaurs” – people who assist machines, rather than the other way around. Finding a CC licensed modular synth was much harder than I thought, but I found Stephen Drake’s image and stitched it into a mandala. Cutting out the horse’s head for the reverse centaur was a lot of work (manes are a huuuuge pain in the ass), but I love how his head sits on the public domain high-viz-wearing warehouse worker’s body I cut up (thanks, OSHA!). Seeing as this is an horrors-of-automation story, Cryteria’s HAL9000 eyes make an appearance. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men Rockefeller’s greatest contribution to our culture was inspiring many excellent unflattering caricatures. The IWW’s many-fists-turning-into-one-fist image made it easy to have the collective might of workers toppling the original robber-baron. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/14/aiming-at-dollars/#not-men I link to this post explaining how to make good Mastodon threads at least once a week, so it’s a good thing the graphic turned out so well. Close-cropping the threads from a public domain yarn tangle worked out great. Eugen Rochko’s Mastodon logo was and is the only Affero-licensed image ever to appear on Pluralistic. https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/16/how-to-make-the-least-worst-mastodon-threads/ I spent hours on the sofa one night painstakingly cutting up and reassembling the cover art from a science fiction pulp. I have a folder full of color-corrected, high-rez scans from an 18th century anatomy textbook, and the cross-section head-and-brain is the best of the lot. https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/04/analytical-democratic-theory/#epistocratic-delusions Those old French anatomical drawings are an endless source of delight to me. Take one cross-sectioned noggin, mix in an old PC mainboard, and a vector art illo of a virtuous cycle with some of Cryteria’s HAL9000 eyes and you’ve got a great illustration of Google’s brain-worms. https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/14/googles-ai-hype-circle/ Ireland’s privacy regulator is but a plaything in Big Tech’s hand, but it’s goddamned hard to find an open-access Garda car. I manually dressed some public domain car art in Garda livery, painstakingly tracing it over the panels. The (public domain) baby’s knit cap really hides the seams from replacing the baby’s head with HAL9000’s eye. https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/15/finnegans-snooze/#dirty-old-town Naked-guy-in-a-barrel bankruptcy images feel like something you can find in an old Collier’s or Punch, but I came up snake-eyes and ended up frankensteining a naked body into a barrel for the George Washington crest on the Washington State flag. It came out well, but harvesting the body parts from old muscle-beach photos left George with some really big guns. I tried five different pairs of suspenders here before just drawing in black polyhedrons with little grey dots for rivets. https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/03/when-the-tide-goes-out/#passive-income Illustrating Amazon’s dominance over the EU coulda been easy – just stick Amazon ‘A’s in place of the yellow stars that form a ring on the EU flag. So I decided to riff on Plutarch’s Alexander, out of lands to conquer. Rama’s statue legs were nice and high-rez. I had my choice of public domain ruin images, though it was harder thank expected to find a good Amazon box as a plinth for those broken-off legs. https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/14/flywheel-shyster-and-flywheel/#unfulfilled-by-amazon God help me, I could not stop playing with this image of a demon-haunted IoT car. All those reflections! The knife sticking out of the steering wheel, the multiple Munsch ’Scream’ers, etc etc. The more I patchked with it, the better it got, though. This one’s a banger. https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon To depict a “data-driven dictatorship,” I ganked elements of heavily beribboned Russian military dress uniforms, replacing the head with HAL9000’s eye. I turned the foreground into the crowds from the Nuremberg rallies and filled the sky with Matrix code waterfall. https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/26/dictators-dilemma/#garbage-in-garbage-out-garbage-back-in The best thing about analogizing DRM to demonic possession is the wealth of medieval artwork to choose from . This one comes from the 11th century ’Compendium rarissimum totius Artis Magicae sistematisatae per celeberrimos Artis hujus Magistros.’ I mixed in the shiny red Tesla (working those reflections!), and a Tesla charger to make my point. https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/edison-not-tesla/#demon-haunted-world Yet more dividends from those old French anatomical plates: a flayed skull, a detached jaw, a quack electronic gadget, a Wachowski code waterfall and some HAL 9000 eyes and you’ve got a truly unsettling image of machine-compelled speech. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/02/self-incrimination/#wei-bai-bai I had no idea this would work out so well, but daaaamn, crossfading between a Wachowski code waterfall and a motherboard behind a roiling thundercloud is dank af. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/03/there-is-no-cloud/#only-other-peoples-computers Of all the turkeys-voting-for-Christmas self-owns conservative culture warriors fall for, few can rival the “banning junk fees is woke” hustle. Slap a US-flag Punisher logo on and old-time card imprinter, add a GOP logo to a red credit-card blank, and then throw in a rustic barn countertop and you’ve got a junk-fee extracter fit for the Cracker Barrel. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/04/owning-the-libs/#swiper-no-swiping Putting the Verizon logo on the Hinderberg was an obvious gambit (even if I did have to mess with the flames a lot), but the cutout of Paul Marcarelli as the ‘can you hear me now?’ guy, desaturated and contrast-matched, made it sing. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/10/smartest-guys-in-the-room/#can-you-hear-me-now Note to self: Tux the Penguin is really easy to source in free/open formats! He looks great with HAL9000 eyes. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/18/openwashing/#you-keep-using-that-word-i-do-not-think-it-means-what-you-think-it-means Rockwell’s self-portrait image is a classic; that made it a natural for a HAL9000-style remix about AI art. I put a bunch of time into chopping and remixing Rockwell’s signature to give it that AI look, and added as many fingers as would fit on each hand. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/20/everything-made-by-an-ai-is-in-the-public-domain/ The West Midlands Police were kind enough to upload a high-rez of their surveillance camera control room to Flickr under a CC license (they’ve since deleted it), and it was the perfect frame for dozens of repeating clown images with HAL9000 red noses. This worked out great. The clown face is from a 1940s ad for novelty masks. https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/23/automation-blindness/#humans-in-the-loop I spent an absurd amount of time transforming a photo I took of three pinball machines into union-busting themed tables, pulling in a bunch of images from old Soviet propaganda art. An editorial cartoon of Teddy Roosevelt with his big stick takes center stage, while a NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo’s official portrait presides over the scene. I hand-made the eight-segment TILT displays. https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/06/goons-ginks-and-company-finks/#if-blood-be-the-price-of-your-cursed-wealth Working with the highest-possible rez sources makes all the difference in the world. Syvwlch’s extremely high-rez paint-scraper is a gift to people writing about web-scraping, and the Matrix code waterfall mapped onto it like butter. https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/17/how-to-think-about-scraping/ This old TWA ad depicting a young man eagerly pitching an older man has incredible body-language – so much so that when I replaced their heads with raw meat, the intent and character remained intact. I often struggle for background to put behind images like this, but high-rez currency imagery, with the blown up intaglio, crushes it. https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/04/dont-let-your-meat-loaf/#meaty-beaty-big-and-bouncy I transposed Photoshop instructions for turning a face into a zombie into Gimp instructions to make Zombie Uncle Sam. The guy looking at his watch kills me. He’s from an old magazine illustration about radio broadcasting. What a face! https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/18/the-people-no/#tell-ya-what-i-want-what-i-really-really-want The mansplaining guy from the TWA ad is back, but this time he’s telling a whopper. It took so much work to give him that Pinnocchio nose. Clearly, he’s lying about capitalism, hence the Atlas Shrugged cover. Bosch’s “Garden of Earthly Delights” makes for an excellent, public domain hellscape fit for a nonconensual pitch about the miracle of capitalism. https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/27/six-sells/#youre-holding-it-wrong There’s no better image for stories about techbros scamming rubes than Bosch’s ‘The Conjurer.’ Throw in Jeff Bezos’s head and an Amazon logo and you’re off to the races. I boobytrapped this image by adding as many fingers as I could fit onto each of these figures in the hopes that someone could falsely accuse me of AI-generating this. No one did. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/06/attention-rents/#consumer-welfare-queens Once again, it’s Bosch to the rescue. Slap a different smiley-face emoji on each of the tormented figures in ‘Garden of Earthly Delights’ and you’ve got a perfect metaphor for the ‘brand safety’ problem of hard news dying online because brands don’t want to be associated with unpleasant things, and the news is very unpleasant indeed. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/11/ad-jacency/#brand-safety I really struggle to come up with images for my linkdump posts. I’m running out of ways to illustrate assortments and varieties. I got to noodling with a Kellogg’s mini-cereal variety pack and I realized it was the perfect place for a vicious gorilla image I’d just found online in a WWI propaganda poster headed ‘Destroy This Mad Brute.’ I put so many fake AI tells in this one – extra pupils, extra fingers, a super-AI-esque Kellogg’s logo. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/05/variegated/#nein Bloodletting is the perfect metaphor for using rate-hikes to fight inflation. A vintage image of the Treasury, spattered with blood, makes a great backdrop. For the foreground, a medieval woodcut of bloodletting quacks – give one the head of Larry Summers, the other, Jerome Powell. For the patient, use Uncle Sam’s head. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/20/bloodletting/#inflated-ego I killed a long videoconference call slicing up an old pulp cover showing a killer robot zapping a couple of shrunken people in bell-jars. It was the ideal image to illustrate Big Tech’s enshittification, especially when it was decorated with some classic tech slogans. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/22/who-wins-the-argument/#corporations-are-people-my-friend There’s something meditative about manually cutting out Tenniel engravings from Alice – the Jabberwock was insane. But it was worth it for this Tron-inflected illustration using a distorted Cartesian grid to display the enormous difference between e/acc and AI doomers, and everyone else in the world. https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space Multilayer source images for your remixing pleasure: Scientist in chemlab</p>

<li>U.S. may hike tariffs on Chinese EVs</li>
</ol>
</h3>
<p style>
The Biden administration is reportedly considering raising tariffs on electric vehicles made in China, which tend to run cheaper than those made in the U.S. The move would be an attempt to “bolster the U.S. clean energy industry,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5754c71f95&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explains</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. Chinese EVs are already subject to a 25% tariff. While an increase wouldn’t mean much in the immediate term for most Americans, it would put added strain on relations with China, which are already tense. Global markets are facing a glut of cheap Chinese clean-energy products, and the administration is reportedly also considering higher levies on solar products and EV battery packs, the <em>Journal</em> reports.

<strong></strong>Wildflowers may be evolving to rely less on pollinators in order to reproduce as insect numbers decline.

Sharks have been around for millions of years, but their population has dropped by 70% in the past 50 years. That’s mostly been driven by the value of their fins, which are considered a delicacy and status symbol in parts of Asia. Today, we’ll hear how demand for the fins has driven a network of illicit trafficking. Plus, new cars see big gains in fuel efficiency.

<h2 id="poinsettias-origins-namesakes-checkered-history-get-new-attention">Poinsettia’s Origins, Namesake’s Checkered History Get New Attention</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SANTA FE, N.M. — Like Christmas trees, Santa and reindeer, the poinsettia has long been a ubiquitous symbol of the holiday season in the U.S. and across Europe.</p>
<p>But now, nearly 200 years after the plant with the bright crimson leaves was introduced in the U.S., attention is once again turning to the poinsettia’s origins and the checkered history of its namesake, a slaveowner and lawmaker who played a part in the forced removal of Native Americans from their land. Some people would now rather call the plant by the name of its Indigenous origin in southern Mexico.</p>
<p>Some things to know:</p>
<p>Where did the name poinsettia come from?</p>
<p>The name comes from the amateur botanist and statesman Joel Roberts Poinsett, who happened upon the plant in 1828 during his tenure as the first U.S. minister to the newly independent Mexico.</p>
<p>Poinsett, who was interested in science as well as potential cash crops, sent clippings of the plant to his home in South Carolina and to a botanist in Philadelphia, who affixed the eponymous name to the plant in gratitude.</p>
<p>A life-size bronze statue of Poinsett still stands in his honor in downtown Greenville, South Carolina.</p>
<p>However, he was cast out of Mexico within a year of his discovery, having earned a local reputation for intrusive political maneuvering that extended to a network of secretive masonic lodges and schemes to contain British influence.</p>
<p>Is the ‘poinsettia’ name losing its luster?</p>
<p>As more people learn of its namesake’s complicated history, the name “poinsettia” has become less attractive in the United States.</p>
<p>Unvarnished published accounts reveal Poinsett as a disruptive advocate for business interests abroad, a slaveowner on a rice plantation in the U.S., and a secretary of war who helped oversee the forced removal of Native Americans, including the westward relocation of Cherokee populations to Oklahoma known as the “Trail of Tears.”</p>
<p>In a new biography titled Flowers, Guns and Money, historian Lindsay Schakenbach Regele describes the cosmopolitan Poinsett as a political and economic pragmatist who conspired with a Chilean independence leader and colluded with British bankers in Mexico. Though he was a slaveowner, he opposed secession, and he didn’t live to see the Civil War.</p>
<p>Schakenbach Regele renders tough judgment on Poinsett’s treatment of and regard for Indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>“Because Poinsett belonged to learned societies, contributed to botanists’ collections, and purchased art from Europe, he could more readily justify the expulsion of Natives from their homes,” she writes.</p>
<p>A Christmas flower of many names</p>
<p>The cultivation of the plant dates back to the Aztec empire in Mexico 500 years ago.</p>
<p>Among Nahuatl-speaking communities of Mexico, the plant is known as the cuetlaxochitl (kwet-la-SHO-sheet), meaning “flower that withers.” It’s an apt description of the thin red leaves on wild varieties of the plant that grow to heights above 3 meters.</p>
<p>Year-end holiday markets in Latin America brim with the potted plant known in Spanish as the “flor de Nochebuena,” or “flower of Christmas Eve,” which is entwined with celebrations of the night before Christmas. The “Nochebuena” name is traced to early Franciscan friars who arrived from Spain in the 16th century. Spaniards once called it “scarlet cloth.”</p>
<p>Additional nicknames abound: “Santa Catarina” in Mexico, “estrella federal,” or “federal star” in Argentina and “penacho de Incan,” or “headdress” in Peru.</p>
<p>Ascribed in the 19th century, the Latin name, Euphorbia pulcherrima, means “the most beautiful” of a diverse genus with a milky sap of latex.</p>
<p>So what is its preferred name?</p>
<p>“Cuetaxochitl” is winning over some enthusiasts among Mexican youths, including the diaspora in the U.S., according to Elena Jackson Albarrán, a professor of Mexican history and global and intercultural studies at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a trend towards people openly saying: ‘Don’t call this flower either poinsettia or Nochebuena. It’s cuetlaxochitl,’” said Jackson Albarrán. “There’s going to be a big cohort of people who are like, ‘Who cares?’”</p>
<p>Most ordinary people in Mexico never say “poinsettia” and don’t talk about Poinsett, according to Laura Trejo, a Mexican biologist who is leading studies on the genetic history of the U.S. poinsettia.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’s only the historians, the diplomats and, well, the politicians who know the history of Poinsett,” Trejo said.</p>
<p>The Mexican roots of U.S. poinsettias</p>
<p>Mexican biologists in recent years have traced the genetic stock of U.S. poinsettia plants to a wild variant in the Pacific coastal state of Guerrero, verifying lore about Poinsett’s pivotal encounter there. The scientists also are researching a rich, untapped diversity of other wild variants, in efforts that may help guard against the poaching of plants and theft of genetic information.</p>
<p>The flower still grows wild along Mexico’s Pacific Coast and parts of Central America as far as Costa Rica.</p>
<p>Trejo, of the National Council of Science and Technology in the central state of Tlaxcala, said some informal outdoor markets still sell the “sun cuetlaxochitl” that resemble wild varieties, alongside modern patented varieties.</p>
<p>In her field research travels, Trejo has found households that preserve ancient traditions associated with the flower.</p>
<p>“It’s clear to us that this plant, since the pre-Hispanic era, is a ceremonial plant, an offering, because it’s still in our culture, in the interior of the county, to cut the flowers and take them to the altars,” she said in Spanish. “And this is primarily associated with the maternal goddesses: with Coatlicue, Tonantzin and now with the Virgin Mary.”</p>
<p>A lasting figure in history</p>
<p>Regardless of his troubled history, Poinsett’s legacy as an explorer and collector continues to loom large: Some 1,800 meticulously tended poinsettias are delivered in November and December from greenhouses in Maryland to a long list of museums in Washington, D.C., affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p>A “pink-champagne” cultivar adorns the National Portrait Gallery this year.</p>
<p>Poinsett’s name may also live on for his connection to other areas of U.S. culture. He advocated for the establishment of a national science museum, and in part due to his efforts, a fortune bequeathed by British scientist James Smithson was used to underwrite the creation of the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

<h2 id="international-astronaut-will-be-invited-on-future-nasa-moon-landing">International Astronaut Will Be Invited on Future NASA Moon Landing</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — An international astronaut will join U.S. astronauts on the moon by decade’s end under an agreement announced Wednesday by NASA and the White House.</p>
<p>The news came as Vice President Kamala Harris convened a meeting in Washington of the National Space Council, the third such gathering under the Biden administration.</p>
<p>There was no mention of who the international moonwalker might be or even what country would be represented. A NASA spokeswoman later said that crews would be assigned closer to the lunar-landing missions, and that no commitments had yet been made to another country.</p>
<p>NASA has included international astronauts on trips to space for decades. Canadian Jeremy Hansen will fly around the moon a year or so from now with three U.S. astronauts.</p>
<p>Another crew would actually land; it would be the first lunar touchdown by astronauts in more than a half-century. That’s not likely to occur before 2027, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p>All 12 moonwalkers during NASA’s Apollo program of the 1960s and 1970s were U.S. citizens. The space agency’s new moon exploration program is named Artemis after Apollo’s mythological twin sister.</p>
<p>Including international partners “is not only sincerely appreciated, but it is urgently needed in the world today,” Hansen told the council.</p>
<p>NASA has long stressed the need for global cooperation in space, establishing the Artemis Accords along with the U.S. State Department in 2020 to promote responsible behavior not just at the moon but everywhere in space.</p>
<p>Representatives from all 33 countries that have signed the accords so far were expected at the space council’s meeting in Washington.</p>
<p>“We know from experience that collaboration on space delivers,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, citing the Webb Space Telescope, a U.S., European and Canadian effort.</p>
<p>Notably missing from the Artemis Accords: Russia and China, the only countries besides the U.S. to launch their own citizens into orbit.</p>
<p>Russia is a partner with NASA in the International Space Station, along with Europe, Japan and Canada.</p>
<p>Even earlier in the 1990s, the Russian and U.S. space agencies teamed up during the shuttle program to launch each other’s astronauts to Russia’s former orbiting Mir station.</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s meeting, Harris also announced new policies to ensure the safe use of space as more and more private companies and countries aim skyward.</p>
<p>Among the issues that the U.S. is looking to resolve: the climate crisis and the growing amount of space junk around Earth.</p>
<p>A 2021 anti-satellite missile test by Russia added more than 1,500 pieces of potentially dangerous orbiting debris, and Blinken joined others at the meeting in calling for all nations to end such destructive testing.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Jirka’s blog</p>
<p>The PILOT Pentopia Chameleon stylus for Palm III and VI {sup}1{/sup} arrived today. It is a stylus with integrated reset pin and - last but not least - an actual pen. The pen refill is thin and it is labelled “Pilot” but I assume that a thin (non-pressurized) Fischer refill will fit here. This stylus has a bit different shape than the original Palm III pen and its tip is a bit harder but it is usable (I am writing this post with it). It is also little thicker than the original which is actually a plus - it sits more reliable in stylus housing of my heavily used Palms - I lost several styli from my old IIIxe and almost lost one of my TRGpro recently. The {sup}1{/sup} says that it is better for writing than the original stylus but I don’t think so. I see no improvement.</p>

<p>The title is all wrong because I extensively used the TRG Pro in the past. But the last time when I synced the TRG was in 2/2016 and then I have been using the original Palm III devices (IIIx + IIIxe) instead of the TRG. I have not wanted to damage or lost my only TRG Pro (which is pretty rare as you may know). Now I have two TRGs so I can use one of them on daily basis, I think.</p>

<h2 id="solstice-gatherings-memorialize-homeless-people-who-died-on-us-streets">Solstice Gatherings Memorialize Homeless People Who Died on US Streets</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Phoenix — With his gap-tooth smile, hip-hop routines and volunteer work for a food charity, Roosevelt White III was well-known in the downtown Phoenix tent city known as The Zone.</p>
<p>But like many homeless people, White suffered from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. He died unexpectedly one sweltering September day at age 36.</p>
<p>Thousands of people like White who died this year without a permanent home are being memorialized on Thursday in communities from Cape Cod, Massachusetts, to La Crosse, Wisconsin, to Riverside, California.</p>
<p>Established in 1990, the increasingly popular Homeless Persons’ Memorial Day is observed with prayers, candles, moments of silence and the reading of names on Dec. 21, the first day of winter and the longest night of the year.</p>
<p>A national gathering called “One Life, Too Many. Another Year, Too Long” is planned for Thursday afternoon in Washington, with a Zoom call so people can follow from afar.</p>
<p>Other gatherings will be in Cincinnati, Ohio; Wilmington, Delaware; and San Diego. A ceremony in Phoenix will honor 758 homeless people confirmed to have died so far this year in Maricopa County, the most populous in Arizona and home to Phoenix, the state’s largest city.</p>
<p>That’s already a record. The Maricopa County Medical Examiner investigated 732 deaths of homeless people in 2022, representing a 42% jump in deaths from 2021.</p>
<p>“Without sufficient housing and services, people will continue to die on the streets,” said Lisa Glow, CEO at Central Arizona Shelter Services, which operates the state’s largest emergency shelter, a 600-bed facility in Phoenix.</p>
<p>DeBorah Gilbert White, the public education director for the National Coalition for the Homeless, said learning about those who died can shatter stereotypes. At one event several years ago, she learned of a 3-year-old homeless girl who died in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>White said that as the population grows older, more people are dying in their 60s. She noted that many with chronic conditions like diabetes don’t have the necessary conditions, such as refrigeration for insulin, to care for their health.</p>
<p>Overall, homelessness is surging. The recent Annual Homeless Assessment Report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development showed that roughly 653,100 people in the United States were experiencing homelessness. That’s a 12% overall increase over the previous year and the highest since reporting began in 2007.</p>
<p>“A lot of people living in encampments are uninsured and without access to medical treatment for a variety of illnesses that are exacerbated by living unsheltered,” said Etel Haxhiaj, a spokesperson for the National Healthcare for the Homeless Council.</p>
<p>The council supports remembrance events to push for better tracking of the deaths.</p>
<p>Maricopa County is among the few U.S. jurisdictions engaged in such tracking.</p>
<p>Drug and alcohol abuse played a role in many of the deaths and was often the main cause. While a stroke killed White, methamphetamine intoxication contributed to his death, according to the medical examiner. Cardiovascular events like strokes and heart attacks, followed by traffic injuries, are also common ways that homeless people die.</p>
<p>Many homeless people are estranged from family, which means their deaths can pass virtually unnoticed. But when White died, at least 60 people, including family members from Arizona and Oklahoma, showed up for his funeral. The food was catered by Feed Phoenix, the nonprofit organization he volunteered with.</p>
<p>Among the mourners was Phoenix documentary photographer Eric Elmore, who created numerous black and white portraits of White over a year. The downtown encampment where White lived once housed hundreds of people in tents, but it has since been cleared out under a court order.</p>
<p>“He had this kind of energy that would just draw you in,” Elmore said of White. “He had a huge personality.”</p>
<p>Megan Kepler, who volunteered with White, remembered him on Wednesday as “a man who was full of kindness and joy.”</p>
<p>“Although he had many struggles, he always had a smile on his face and a positive attitude. He stayed hopeful in the face of difficulties,” Kepler said. “We miss our friend dearly, and hope that others can see that he was not just a number, but instead a valued and loved human being.”</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>So what can you do with it? Well, let’s first address the elephant in the room – the internet is still lousy on OS 9. Despite Cameron Kaiser’s genius effort put into his Classilla browser project, he’s pretty much squeezed every ounce of usability from the now 20+ year old underlying networking frameworks. A lot of websites still render “ok” in the browser, but most of the modern web will simply cause it to spit back an error. Also, file sharing with other machines on your network takes a bit more forethought these days as OS 9’s implementation of AppleTalk will only work with OS X versions up to 10.4 Tiger. In Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) and later, AppleTalk will not function at all without some difficult technical workarounds, so a “bridge” Mac is generally recommended (for those not familiar with that term – bridge Macs are machines that can handle both legacy and modern technologies and can be networked between both old and new hardware). It is also possible to wring out a bit more usability by setting up a web proxy such as macHTTP and running a small Netatalk server on one of your modern Macs (this is something I’d like to feature in the future). ↫ Adam Goff at Low End Mac Running Mac OS 9 today has become somewhat of a rite of passage for retrocomputing and operating system nerds (…2006), and every few years a new article about the experience makes the rounds. For good reason, too – OS 9 is fun, quirky, has tons of software to play around with, and still looks and feels great.</p>

<h2 id="farm-rail-companies-urge-reopening-of-us-mexico-crossings-shut-over-migrants">Farm, Rail Companies Urge Reopening of US-Mexico Crossings Shut Over Migrants</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>EAGLE PASS, Texas — Dozens of major U.S. agricultural groups on Wednesday urged the U.S. to reopen two rail crossings on the Texas-Mexico border in an effort by businesses to restore the trade routes shuttered because of increased migrant crossings. </p>
<p>In a sharply worded letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the growers - representing corn, milk, rice and soybean producers, among others - said the crossings could be easily reopened and that closures already had caused steep export losses. </p>
<p>“Each day the crossings are closed we estimate almost 1 million bushels of grain exports are potentially lost along with export potential for many other agricultural products,” the groups wrote, adding that blocking food heading to Mexico could lead to inflation or food insecurity there. </p>
<p>Railroad companies and business groups - including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce - in recent days have pressed U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to reopen the two rail bridges in Eagle Pass and El Paso after U.S. border authorities closed them on Monday in order to “redirect personnel” to process migrants crossing the border.  </p>
<p>Among the groups signing the agricultural business letter were the National Grain and Feed Association, U.S. Wheat Associates, American Soybean Association and National Corn Growers Association.</p>
<p>The U.S. Border Patrol apprehended about 10,800 migrants at the southwest border on Monday, according to an internal agency report reviewed by Reuters, a tally several current and former officials said was near or at a single-day record high.  </p>
<p>The news came after Mexico’s immigration agency said in an internal December 1 memo reviewed by Reuters that it would suspend migrant removals because of an end-of-year funding crunch.  </p>
<p>Operations should return to normal in January, a Mexican source familiar with the matter said, adding that the U.S. closure of legal border crossings appeared to be an attempt by the U.S. to pressure Mexico over the scaled-back enforcement. </p>
<p>Mexico’s foreign ministry spokesperson said no date had been set for resuming the repatriations. </p>
<p>The agricultural groups said CBP could reopen the railroad bridges with as few as five employees per crossing, challenging the agency’s rationale for closing the trade routes. </p>
<p>Acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said on Tuesday that illegal crossings were “presenting a serious challenge” and that CBP was using all available resources to keep agents and migrants safe. </p>
<p>CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment related to the agricultural groups’ demands, which echoed concerns from Mexico’s top farm lobby. </p>
<p>Billions in monthly trade</p>
<p>In October, total rail freight between the El Paso and Eagle Pass ports topped $3 billion in both directions, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. That accounted for 4% of total trade across the U.S.-Mexico border that month. </p>
<p>Neil Bradley, chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement to Reuters that the rail shutdowns “will inflict significant economic harm” and “do nothing to secure the border.”  </p>
<p>The increase in migrant crossings comes as Democratic President Joe Biden, who is running for re-election in 2024, has sought to strike a deal with Republican lawmakers that would pair increased U.S. border security with military aid for Ukraine and Israel.  </p>
<p>But a bipartisan group of senators negotiating a compromise have so far failed to reach a deal as a Christmas break approaches. </p>
<p>Eagle Pass and El Paso have received thousands of newcomers in recent days, as migrants - including many families with young children - make their way to the border by bus, atop cargo trains, on foot and even by bicycle. </p>
<p>On Wednesday in Eagle Pass, hundreds of migrants were being held in an outdoor area near the Rio Grande. Three migrants were carried out with medical emergencies in the afternoon while others called out for food, a Reuters witness said.  </p>
<p>CBP said it was aware of two medical emergencies, one related to dehydration and another that appeared to be seizure-related. </p>
<p>During a press conference near the border, U.S. Representative Tony Gonzales, a Republican who represents Eagle Pass, urged U.S. lawmakers to make legal changes to deter illegal border crossings that have disrupted trade and transit. </p>
<p>“This has to come to an end,” Gonzales said. “We need to have open trade and commerce again.” </p>
<p>Some 270 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have been pulled from their jobs handling deportations and international investigations to help with migrant transport and other tasks at the border, a Department of Homeland Security official told Reuters, requesting anonymity to discuss internal operations.  </p>
<p>Union Pacific and Berkshire Hathaway’s BNSF Railway, two of the nation’s largest freight railroad companies, warned of supply chain disruptions ahead of the Christmas holiday because of the railway bridge closures. </p>
<p>Union Pacific said in a statement on its website that a range of products - including grain, beer, metals, cement and automotive parts - have been halted because of the closures. The closed bridges account for about 45% of its cross-border shipments, and the overall economic impact of the closure will be more than $200 million per day, the rail company said.  </p>
<p>BNSF declined to comment on the value of goods affected by the closings. </p>
<p>In addition to the railroad crossing closures, U.S. border authorities this month have closed a busy pedestrian crossing near San Diego, California, and another crossing in remote Lukeville, Arizona, to free up workers to process arriving migrants.</p>

<h2 id="vibe-check-30">Vibe Check №30</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Dave Rupert blog</p>
<p>
The year is almost over. The weather is delightful in Austin and walking the neighborhood is a joy. Happiness arrives in holiday cards. The tree is up and the ambient stress of moonlighting as an assistant to a jolly, fat norseman takes its toll. The power grid still hums but –the question on every Texan’s mind– for how long?
</p>
<p>
There’s a lot going on behind the scenes, big life changes, but here’s some of the highlights (nay, lowlights?) from the past couple months.
</p>
<h2>
My wife’s back went out
</h2>
<p>
Right after my last vibe check my wife’s back went out. We’re not sure what caused it, but this was the most severe episode she’s ever experienced. One parent down had a massive impact on our quality of life. November productivity was a wash due as I scrambled to assist her, visiting doctors, and assuming a large swath of family responsibilities. She is so much better at keeping the family gears turning, I was drowning.
</p>
<p>
After some successful PT she’s doing much better and we’re almost back to where we were before November, which is welcome. And our kids pitched in and helped as best they could, I’m thankful for that.
</p>
<h2>
Covid strikes again
</h2>
<p>
The week after Thanksgiving my beautiful daughter comes into our room at night and is restless. In a moment of uncool dadsmanship I inform her that she’s snoring too loud. A steam shower fixed the issue, poor kid. A couple days later I started to feel ill… then I felt terrible… then I tested positive for Covid. Oof.
</p>
<p>
This one laid me out pretty good with that terrible incurable headache and sandbag-like sinus gunk. I spent six days sick and isolated, whisking myself away like a goddamed phantom of the opera whenever my family came home. No one else tested positive, but seems like a clear case that my daughter carried it home from school after the break and gave it to me, the immune system deprived remote worker; a blank petri dish ripe for infection.
</p>
<p>
I’m all better now, but let me say getting Covid the first week of December puts you super far behind in your Christmas shopping.
</p>
<h2>
The Great Subscription Culling
</h2>
<p>
After interviewing family members about what shows they actually watch from each service and organizing it all in a spreadsheet, I nuked about $100 worth of monthly subscriptions. Services including but not limited to…
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Streaming: Peacock, Disney/Hulu, YouTube Premium, Apple One, Dropout, Crunchyroll
</li>
<li>
Community: Some Patreons, some Discord boosts
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The hard thing is that I like these services. I find value in them… just not all at the same time. How are we going to live without them? Well there’s some strategy…
</p>
<ol>
<li>
On-demand services - If we want Service X more than Netlfix, we cancel Netflix.
</li>
<li>
Move to the ad-supported version of services (YouTube, Disney/Hulu) - Way cheaper and if we all hate the ads, we can decide as a family to remove them.
</li>
<li>
Ask for some as gifts (Dropout, Crunchyroll) - A monthly service fee for entertainment for one person in the household is excessive… but those make great gifts! It’s some bank account slight of hand, but I can enjoy my weird Gundam obsession guilt free.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
On that note, a ShopTalk listener heard wind about my plans and graciously gifted me a subscription to Crunchyroll. Incredibly thoughtful. Thank you, Melanie.
</p>
<p>
I think Subscription Culling should be a national holiday we do every equinox. If streaming services are going to raise prices every quarter, we should normalize the threat of abandoning them en masse.

<a href="https://amzn.to/48FMBof">The Big Myth</a> - A dismantling of the idea about the invisible hand of the market. Paired with other books I’ve read this year, you see how “That’s socialism!” is a propaganda dogwhistle to cover for a much bigger lie that unfettered capitalism works. Starting back in the union busting days because people were getting their arms cut off in the machines, businesses began promoting the idea that regulating business is bad. The conservative thinktank at the Chicago school of economics developed the lie by cherry-picking and bastardizing Adam Smith’s writings to suit their “greed is good” agenda. I never knew Milton Friedman was a person I could get mad at… but here we are. This lie was then carried on by GE propagandists like (former SAG union president) Ronald Reagan who popularized trickle down economics during his US presidency and continued with neoliberal bank deregulation in the Clinton administration. The too-big-to-failures of the market never fall on the corporations, it’s always on the public and the taxpayer. [/rant]

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
As a part of having new x86_64 build instances, we updated all of the RPM signing keys to meet FIPS requirements (except RHEL7, where updated GPG keys will appear but not meet FIPS requirement) for RHEL 9, 8 and 7 (and their derivatives), and Fedora 39 &amp; 38. Existing keys are weak and throwing warnings to many users.
</p>
<p>
We will also update aarch64 and ppc64le signing keys as well.
</p>
<p>
New repo RPMs, the new keys and RPMs re-signed with the new keys will be published on 3 January 2024.
</p>
<p>
If you want to receive updates from the PostgreSQL RPM repo after 3 January 2024, you’ll need to update the repository RPM and install new keys. We will publish detailed information and howto in <a href="https://yum.postgresql.org">https://yum.postgresql.org</a> before new year.

<h2 id="effects-of-ondansetron-exposure-during-icu-stay-on-outcomes-of-critically-ill-patients-with-sepsis-a-cohort-study">Effects of ondansetron exposure during ICU stay on outcomes of critically ill patients with sepsis: a cohort study</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with high morbidity and mortality, characterized by an inadequate systemic immune response to an initial stimulus. Whether the use of ondansetron (OND) during intensive care unit (ICU) stay is associated with the prognosis of sepsis patients remains unclear.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Critically ill patients with sepsis were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to explore the association between OND use and clinical outcomes after adjusting for confounders. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used for survival analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) and subgroup analysis were performed to further confirm the results.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
The OND-medication group showed reduced in-hospital mortality, 28-day and 90-day mortalities. The OR for in-hospital mortality was 0.80 (0.64-0.99) and HRs for 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality were 0.77 (0.64-0.92) and 0.83 (0.70-0.98), respectively. After PSM, the clinical outcomes remained consistent. In-hospital mortality was lower in the OND-medication group (28.1% <italic>vs</italic>. 35.8%, P= 0.044), as well as 28-day mortality (23.4% <italic>vs</italic>. 32.1%, P=0.022) and 90-day mortality (27.4% <italic>vs</italic>. 35.8%, P=0.035). The protective effect of OND in sepsis patients was relatively robust, independent of age, septic shock, vasopressin and mechanical ventilation. Additionally, the OND users had longer lengths of stay in ICU (6.9(3.1-13.2) <italic>vs</italic>. 5.1(2.5-11.0), P = 0.026) while no statistical differences were found in lengths of stay in hospital (P = 0.333).
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
OND exposure might be associated with lower in-hospital, 28-day, and 90-day mortality rates in critically ill patients with sepsis. This study indicated that OND might help improve the prognosis of patients with sepsis.

<h2 id="drosophila-melanogaster-as-a-model-to-study-polymicrobial-synergy-and-dysbiosis">Drosophila melanogaster as a model to study polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has emerged as a valuable model for investigating human biology, including the role of the microbiome in health and disease. Historically, studies involving the infection of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> with single microbial species have yielded critical insights into bacterial colonization and host innate immunity. However, recent evidence has underscored that multiple microbial species can interact in complex ways through physical connections, metabolic cross-feeding, or signaling exchanges, with significant implications for healthy homeostasis and the initiation, progression, and outcomes of disease. As a result, researchers have shifted their focus toward developing more robust and representative <italic>in vivo</italic> models of co-infection to probe the intricacies of polymicrobial synergy and dysbiosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the pioneering work and recent advances in the field, highlighting the utility of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as an alternative model for studying the multifaceted microbial interactions that occur within the oral cavity and other body sites. We will discuss the factors and mechanisms that drive microbial community dynamics, as well as their impacts on host physiology and immune responses. Furthermore, this review will delve into the emerging evidence that connects oral microbes to systemic conditions in both health and disease. As our understanding of the microbiome continues to evolve, <italic>Drosophila</italic> offers a powerful and tractable model for unraveling the complex interplay between host and microbes including oral microbes, which has far-reaching implications for human health and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.

<h2 id="protective-role-of-n-acetylcysteine-and-sulodexide-on-endothelial-cells-exposed-on-patients-serum-after-sars-cov-2-infection">Protective role of N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide on endothelial cells exposed on patients’ serum after SARS-CoV-2 infection</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 causes hyperinflammation and activation of coagulation cascade and, as a result, aggravates endothelial cell dysfunction. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide have been found to mitigate endothelial damage. The influence on coronary artery endothelial cells of serum collected after 4 ± 1 months from coronavirus infection was studied. The concentrations of serum samples of interleukin 6, von Willebrand Factor, tissue Plasminogen Activator, and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 were studied. The cultures with serum of patients after coronavirus infection were incubated with N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide to estimate their potential protective role. The blood inflammatory parameters were increased in the group of cultures incubated with serum from patients after coronavirus infection. Supplementation of the serum from patients after coronavirus infection with N-acetylcysteine or Sulodexide reduced the synthesis of interleukin 6 and von Willebrand Factor. No changes in the synthesis of tissue Plasminogen Activator were observed. N-acetylcysteine reduced the synthesis of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1. N-acetylcysteine and Sulodexide increased the tPA/PAI-1 ratio. N-acetylcysteine may have a role in reducing the myocardial injury occurring in the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Sulodexide can also play a protective role in post-COVID-19 patients.

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Aims
</title>
<p>
This study aimed to investigate the association between the gut microbiota and the risk of stroke.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Faecal samples from 60 participants in South China, including 45 individuals with risk factors for stroke and 15 healthy controls, were collected and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. A bioinformatics analysis was performed to characterise the gut microbial diversity and taxonomic compositions at different risk levels (low, moderate, and high) of stroke. Functional prediction and correlation analyses between the microbiota and laboratory markers were performed to explore the potential mechanisms.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
A significant difference in beta diversity was observed between the participants from the stroke risk and healthy control groups. Linear discriminant effect size analysis revealed a large number of vascular beneficial bacteria enriched in the participants from the healthy control and low-risk groups, but a few vascular harmful bacteria were more abundant in the participants from the high-risk group than in those from the other groups. In addition, <italic>Anaerostipes</italic>, <italic>Clostridium_XlVb</italic>, and <italic>Flavonifractor</italic>, all of which belonged to the <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum, were enriched in the participants from the low-risk group, and their relative abundances gradually decreased as the stroke risk increased. Spearman’s analysis revealed that these outstanding microbiota correlated with the levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, white blood cells, neutrophils, and carotid intima-media thickness.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusion
</title>
<p>
The preliminary evidence suggests that gut microbiota is associated with stroke risk. It potentially ameliorates atherosclerosis by targeting lipid metabolism and inflammation. This provides novel insights into the early screening of stroke risk and primary prevention.

<h2 id="the-spatiotemporal-distribution-and-prognostic-factors-of-japanese-encephalitis-in-shanxi-province-china-20052022">The spatiotemporal distribution and prognostic factors of Japanese encephalitis in Shanxi Province, China, 2005–2022</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a naturally occurring localized disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus, which is spread by the Culex tritaeniorhynchus. China has a high rate of JE. Shanxi, located in North China, has a high prevalence of adult JE. Adult JE has more severe complications, mortality, and a higher disease burden, making it a public health issue. This retrospective study examined the dynamic epidemic changes, high-risk areas of JE, and clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of adult JE in Shanxi Province. The findings revealed that July to September was the primary epidemic season of JE and that JE cases were mainly in individuals over the age of 40. The incidence of JE from 2005 to 2022 demonstrated a positive spatial correlation with significant clustering characteristics, with high-incidence clusters in the south and southeast. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that higher cerebrospinal fluid pressure, higher white blood cell counts, higher neutrophil percentage, deep coma, and lower albumin were independent factors for poor prognosis of adult JE. The developed risk prediction model holds great promise in early prognosis assessment of patients, providing a basis for clinical decision-making and early clinical intervention.

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<sec>
<title>
Background
</title>
<p>
Blood is a common sample source for metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in clinical practice. In this study, we aimed to detect the diagnostic value of blood mNGS in a large real-world cohorts.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Methods
</title>
<p>
Blood mNGS results of 1,046 cases were collected and analyzed along with other laboratory tests. The capabilities and accuracy of blood mNGS were compared with other conventional approaches.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Results
</title>
<p>
Both the surgical department and the intensive care unit had a positive rate of over 80% in blood mNGS. The positive rate of mNGS was consistent with clinical manifestations. Among the 739 positive samples, 532 were detected as mixed infections. Compared to pathogen cultures, the negative predictive value of blood mNGS for bacteria and fungi detection was 98.9% [95%CI, 96.9%-100%], with an accuracy rate of 89.39%. When compared with polymer chain reaction, the consistency rates of blood mNGS for virus identification were remarkably high.
</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>
Conclusions
</title>
<p>
Blood mNGS have significant advantages in detecting difficult-to-cultivate bacteria or fungi, viruses, and mixed infections, which benefits patients of surgery department the most. Samples other than blood are recommended for mNGS test if a specific infection is suspected. The reporting threshold and reporting criteria of blood mNGS need to be optimized.

<p>date: 2023-12-21, from: Frontiers in Cellar and Infection Microbiology</p>
<p>
Mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of numerous viruses of global health significance. The term “vector competence” describes the intrinsic ability of an arthropod vector to transmit an infectious agent. Prior to transmission, the mosquito itself presents a complex and hostile environment through which a virus must transit to ensure propagation and transmission to the next host. Viruses imbibed in an infectious blood meal must pass in and out of the mosquito midgut, traffic through the body cavity or hemocoel, invade the salivary glands, and be expelled with the saliva when the vector takes a subsequent blood meal. Viruses encounter physical, cellular, microbial, and immunological barriers, which are influenced by the genetic background of the mosquito vector as well as environmental conditions. Collectively, these factors place significant selective pressure on the virus that impact its evolution and transmission. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of the field in understanding the mosquito-specific factors that underpin vector competence and how each of these mechanisms may influence virus evolution.
