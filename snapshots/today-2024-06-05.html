drops Windows 10 support for new chipsets and processors, while
Microsoft expands testing efforts for new Windows 10 features</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember when I said the honeymoon with AMD’s consumer-friendly
chipset and socket support policy would eventually end? Well, while this
is not exactly that, it will make a lot of people very unhappy. While
AMD, as does any other company, was boastful about its product touting
the 16% IPC boost on Zen 5 and the big AI performance leap delivering up
to 50 TOPS on the NPU side, an interesting drawback of the Ryzen AI 300
series that has managed to avoid getting media attention is the lack of
support for Windows 10. While this was just an unconfirmed rumour last
month even though it was suggested by a supposed Lenovo China manager,
we have now got confirmation from AMD itself that the report, that Strix
point and newer CPUs and APUs will not support Windows 10 is true. ↫
Sayan Sen at NeoWin Official support for Windows 10 is ending next year,
so there is some reason to AMD’s madness, but at the same time, almost
70% of Windows users are currently using Windows 10, and leaving those
users behind might not be the best idea AMD ever had. There is an
argument to be made that at least a reasonable number of these people
are still using Windows 10 not out of their own volition, but because of
Microsoft’s strict hardware requirements, and as such, anyone buying a
new AMD machine will just opt for the latest version of Windows out of
habit, but I still think there’s a sizable contingent of people who
actively choose Windows 10 over 11 for a whole host of reasons. On a
strongly related note, despite 2025 marking the end of regular support
for Windows 10, Microsoft yesterday announced it’s expanding the the
number of Insider channels for new Windows 10 features from one to two,
adding a Beta tier below the existing Release Preview tier. Microsoft,
too, will have to come to terms with the fact that with 70% of Windows
users using Windows 10, they might not even be able to drop support for
the operating system as early as next year. While this 70% number will
surely slowly decrease over the next 12 months, with many people simply
being unable to upgrade due to hardware limitations, I have a suspicion
we might see an extension on that 2025 date.</p>

<h2 id="a-jab-back-at-brexit-or-a-kick-in-the-teeth">A jab back at
Brexit (or a kick in the teeth)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/66606ed88fc52215850ac692/thumb.jpg" alt="Nigel bloody Farage" width="1024" height="683">
</p>
<p>
I grew up in Britain, but I was able to be there because of my European
citizenship. When I moved to the US it was because my mother was
terminally ill; I’d always assumed that I would go back. When the Brexit
vote happened, I took it extremely personally: in lots of ways, the
British public voted to throw people like me out.
</p>
<p>
In the interim, some people have assured me that, no, it’s not people
<em>like me</em>. After all, I have a British accent, and if you didn’t
actually know, you’d be forgiven for assuming that I <em>was</em>
British. Of course, that’s a hugely xenophobic reflex: my British accent
makes me okay, but someone else’s Polish accent means that they’re not.
I stand with the people who more obviously come from somewhere else; I
do, too. All of us are (or, I suppose, <em>were</em>) an active part of
British society, integral parts of communities, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Brexit was offensive, stupid, counterproductive, and xenophobic. I’m not
glad that Britain has been suffering the consequences of this own-goal,
because so many of my friends still live there, and so many communities
are suffering. Spitefully wishing ill on people who are hurting isn’t a
good look. But I certainly have no love for the people who voted for
this travesty.
</p>
<p>
It’s not fun to be barred from living in the place I called home. It
happened at a time in my life when it was becoming apparent that there
was a terminal, genetic disease that runs in my family; multiple family
members had it, and I hadn’t yet had the genetic test that suggested my
sister and I weren’t going to get it. It was the same year that Trump
became President on a similarly anti-immigrant platform. Overall, it was
A Bad Time.
</p>
<p>
Oddly, then, I’m not unhappy to see Nigel Farage run for Prime Minister.
Obviously, he’s among the worst people alive, as if the worst impulses
of British society had been congealed, <em>Doctor Who</em> style, into a
comic book villain with an angry toad for a face. Two of his children
are even dual European citizens, because the hypocrisy is part of the
schtick for these people. But because he’s running, he’s going to split
the Conservative vote, with the hard right voting for Farage and the
people who claim they’re not hard right voting for whoever the
Conservative leader of the week will be on — who picked this day?! —
July 4th. (It’ll be Rishi Sunak or a slowly-decomposing head of iceberg
lettuce. Let’s see.)
</p>
<p>
Keir Starmer is not a giant leap of an improvement: a John Major
impersonator who would have comfortably been a Tory candidate in 1995.
But at least he’s not the guys who brought about Brexit and all of the
ludicrous policies that followed. It’s <em>something</em>. A jab back
for all the people who have been hurt over the last 14 years since hog
aficionado David Cameron was first elected with the help of a
last-minute coalition assist from Nick Clegg, who, of course, now leads
international face-saving for Meta.
</p>
<p>
A Conservative loss is the foothills of the foothills of the foothills
of the work to be done to rebuild. But it would, at least, be a baby
step forward. And even then, I’m ready to be disappointed, because,
really, <em>nothing</em> in this arena has gone well since forever, and
I, for one, have lost the ability to be really optimistic.

Microsoft’s Recall software seems like a horrible idea:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Surprise! It turns out that the unencrypted database and the stored
images may contain your user credentials and passwords. And other stuff.
Got a porn habit? Congratulations, anyone with access to your user
account can see what you’ve been seeing. Use a password manager like
1Password? Sorry, your 1Password passwords are probably visible via
Recall, now.”

<p>
Worse, it’s going to be built into Windows 11 for all compatible
hardware, in a way that will make it hard or impossible to disable. This
doesn’t make sense to me: which privacy-conscious CIO (just for example,
one working in a well-regulated industry where privacy is a legal
requirement) would allow this to roll out? This is yet another reason
for Windows 10 to remain the most popular version.
</p>
<p>
It also seems like nobody at Microsoft (or nobody at Microsoft with
power) has considered the potentially serious social implications of
what they’re building:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Victims of domestic abuse are at risk of their abuser trawling their PC
for any signs that they’re looking for help. Anyone who’s fallen for a
scam that gave criminals access to their PC is also completely at risk.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m increasingly concerned about what Apple will be rolling out on
Monday. We’re hearing quite believable rumors that it’ll be AI-based,
but is it going to be Apple’s take on the same thing? That, too, has the
potential to be a disaster.
</p>
<p>
Once again, I can’t believe that the only way to get away from this
stuff will be to run Linux on the desktop.

            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The pervasive nature of modern technology makes surveillance easier
than ever before, while each successive generation of the public is
accustomed to the privacy status quo of their youth.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The key, as Bruce Schneier argues here, is not to compare with our own
baselines, but to take a step back and consider what a healthy ecosystem
would look like in its own right.
</p>
<p>
The underlying story here is that Microsoft caught state-backed hackers
using its generative AI tools to help with their attacks, and people
were less worried about the attacks themselves than about how Microsoft
found out about them. It’s a reasonable worry, and I thought the same
thing: if Microsoft found this, then they’re likely more aware of the
contextual uses of their platform than we might assume.
</p>
<p>
This is certainly less private than computing was twenty or thirty years
ago. But it’s not a major iteration on where we were five years ago, and
without intervention we’re likely to see more erosion of user privacy
over the next five years.
</p>
<p>
So what should our standards for privacy be overall? How should we
expect a company like Microsoft to treat our potentially sensitive data?
Should we pay more for more security, or should it just be a blanket
expectation? These are all valid questions - although I also have ready,
opinionated answers.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the more important question is: who has the right to come to a
conclusion about these questions, and how will they be enforced? As of
now, it’s still open.

<ol type="1">
<li>Report: Global carbon dioxide removal must quadruple
</h3>
<p>
A team of international researchers this week published
<a href="https://www.stateofcdr.org/resources?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_4MaXQYcNJMd_QZm0mrP0FeBKDAEg3ouTc2gAfCnwoWTurW_SpFyhyDFcpIrM61zMNOhnN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
new report</a> on the state of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) as it
relates to global climate goals. The top-line takeaway is that CDR must
quadruple if we want to stay in line with the goal of limiting global
warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. While stopping <em><em>new</em></em>
greenhouse gas emissions is the top priority in curbing global warming,
experts agree CDR will be needed to address legacy emissions, which can
remain in the atmosphere for decades.
</p>
<p>
Current CDR efforts – from reforestation to direct air capture
technology – remove about 2 billion metric tons of CO2 from the
atmosphere every year. That’s far short of the 7-9 billion metric tons
that will need to be removed annually by 2050. But the report’s authors
say there are signs that CDR development is slowing down. They call for
more investment to support the “high ambitions” of CDR companies, and
want countries to weave CDR policies into their national climate action
plans to spark demand and help CDR scale. Currently just 1.1% of
investment in climate-tech startups goes toward CDR. In April,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/carbon-removal-100-billion-rhodium?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_4MaXQYcNJMd_QZm0mrP0FeBKDAEg3ouTc2gAfCnwoWTurW_SpFyhyDFcpIrM61zMNOhnN" rel="noopener" target="_self">a
report found</a> that the U.S. will need to spend $100 billion per year
by 2050 to make CDR a viable climate solution.
</p>
<p>
One really interesting insight from the report is that grant money is
flowing steadily toward CDR research and development, especially in the
U.S. and Canada: There were fewer than 50 third-party research grants
for CDR in the year 2000, compared to 1,160 in 2022.

published in the journal <em><em>Nature Geoscience</em></em> finds that
the Earth’s groundwater is warming up due to climate change. For the
study, researchers created a model to estimate changes in groundwater
temperatures in varying global warming scenarios. Their model shows that
by the end of the century, groundwater could be between 2.1 and 3.5
degrees Celsius (or between 3.8 and 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer on
average than it is today. This would be bad news for ecosystems that
rely on groundwater, as well as for humans: “As groundwater warms, there
is increased risk of pathogen growth which impacts drinking water
quality – potentially affecting the lives of many people,”

<li>California city votes to cancel contentious geoengineering study
</h3>
<p>
A first-of-its-kind geoengineering research project in California has
been officially canceled. The research, conducted by a team from the
University of Washington, involved spraying sea salt aerosol particles
into the air using an instrument situated on a decommissioned aircraft
carrier in Alameda, California. This process has been pitched as a way
to brighten clouds and reflect the sun’s rays to cool the planet.
Because studies on manipulating the climate are so controversial, the
researchers kept the project on the downlow until it was up and running,
and this lack of transparency – rather than any safety concerns – seems
to have really rubbed city officials the wrong way. The Alameda City
Council voted this morning to reject the experiment. “You didn’t start
out on the right foot,” Alameda Mayor Marilyn Ezzy Ashcraft

</p>
<p>
The dispute may be a little preview of things to come. “There’s a fair
number of people who think there shouldn’t be research [on
geoengineering], and these early experiments have become a proxy
battleground for this larger question about how to think about the
development of these technologies,” David Keith, director of the Climate
Systems Engineering Initiative at the University of Chicago,

with France visit, looks to past and future of global conflicts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House; Paris — U.S. President Joe Biden landed Wednesday in
France to mark the 80th anniversary of the Normandy invasion — and plans
to use the occasion to underscore the need for a strong transatlantic
alliance in the face of Russian aggression in Ukraine.</p>
<p>Biden will meet Ukraine’s president, and with surviving American
veterans of the 1944 beach invasion, said national security adviser Jake
Sullivan. Biden will use the events, Sullivan said, to “talk about,
against the backdrop of war in Europe today, the sacrifices that those
heroes and those veterans made 80 years ago and how it’s our obligation
to continue their mission to fight for freedom.”</p>
<p>Sullivan, who spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to
Paris, said Biden will also deliver a speech on Friday at Normandy that
will cover “the existential fight between dictatorship and freedom” —
all while overlooking a 30-meter tall cliff that Army Rangers had to
scale under enemy gunfire to win the battle that eventually led to
France’s liberation and the demise of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>“And he’ll talk about the dangers of isolationism and how, if we bow
to dictators, fail to stand up to them, they keep going and ultimately
America and the world pays a greater price,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden will also attend a state visit hosted by French President
Emmanuel Macron, in addition to face-to-face talks with Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been invited to the somber
ceremonies marking this decisive battle that led to the end of World War
II.</p>
<p>American presidents have regularly made the journey for this critical
anniversary, and Biden is no exception.</p>
<p>“The president is very much looking forward to going to Normandy over
the course of the next two days of this week to commemorate the service
and the sacrifice, the bravery of the soldiers, Allied and American
alike, who fought in D-Day in that invasion, conducted Operation
Overlord and really spelled through that operation, the beginning of the
end of Nazi Germany, and the beginning of something even more impactful,
and that’s this rules-based international order that we all still
continue to enjoy today,” John Kirby, White House national security
communications adviser, told VOA at the White House.</p>
<p>Here, analysts say, history offers lessons.</p>
<p>“The D-Day landings were the Western Allies’ military statement that
authoritarian regimes could not change boundaries by force,” said Mark
Cancian, a retired Marine colonel and a senior advisor at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. ”That countries could not just be
invaded, and that authoritarian regimes of the type that Nazi Germany
constituted — particularly with its terrible oppression of subjugated
peoples, particularly the Jews — were not acceptable and not just not
acceptable, but would be destroyed.”</p>
<p>Analysts say Biden’s Ukraine goals will be overshadowed by his
increasingly unpopular support of another conflict.</p>
<p>“Even though obviously Ukraine is the top priority for the Europeans,
they are seeing how the Biden administration’s policy on Gaza is
undermining European security in two different ways,” said Trita Parsi,
executive vice president of the Quincy Institute.</p>
<p>“First of all, it is really destroying Western credibility in the
broader international community and in the Global South — any talk about
the rules-based international order at this point, will get laughed at,
given what the Biden administration has done.”</p>
<p>This trip to France, a close ally, comes at the start of six weeks of
high-level U.S. involvement in high-stakes summits — including a peace
summit on Ukraine, a summit of leaders of the Group of Seven, or G7,
leading industrialized countries, and a summit of NATO members.</p>
<p>VOA asked Sullivan what this set of diplomatic events could mean for
peace in Europe, and beyond.</p>
<p>“I think we need to send a clear message to [Russian President
Vladimir] Putin that he cannot outlast us, and that he cannot divide
us,” he replied. “And we have been very good at holding the line on
those two messages, and this is going to be a great opportunity over the
coming weeks to not just put a period at the end of that sentence, but
an exclamation point.”</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Rooftop solar is four times more expensive in America than it is in
other countries. It’s also good for the climate. Should we even care
about its high cost?
</p>
<p>
Yes, says Severin Borenstein, an economist and the director of the
Energy Policy Institute at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas
School of Business. In a recent blog post, he argued that the high cost
of rooftop solar will shift nearly $4 billion onto the bills of low- and
middle-income Californians who <em><em>don’t </em></em>have rooftop
solar. Similar forces could soon spread the cost-shift problem across
the country.
</p>
<p>
On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse talk with Borenstein
about who pays for rooftop solar, why power bills are going up
everywhere, and about whether the government should take over electric
utilities. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive
editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems
engineering at Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Severin Borenstein:</strong> Let me start by saying, there are
two big problems with the way we do this. One is the equity issue, which
I’m sure we’ll get back to, which is that it turns out this extra money,
when you get it by charging people for kilowatt-hours, takes a
disproportionate share of the income from low-income people. <br/> <br/>
The other is, when you set a price for electricity that is way above the
actual cost of providing that electricity, it’s going to discourage
people from electrifying things. Now, it’s also going to discourage
people from just using more electricity, and people who love
conservation say, well, we should have higher rates to encourage
conservation. I think that’s misguided beyond some point, and we are way
beyond that point in many areas. <br/> <br/> But setting that aside for
a moment, we need people to electrify. If we’re going to reduce
greenhouse gases, the way we’re going to electrify […] is by people
switching to electric transportation instead of burning gasoline, and
people switching to electrification for heating, hot-water heating,
cooking, clothes drying, all the things where you have a choice of using
natural gas. In both of those cases, if you overcharge for electricity,
you are discouraging people from doing that sort of electrification.
<br/> <br/> I will give you the extreme example — again, in California.
Right now, even with California’s well known very high gasoline prices,
gasoline and electricity are about at parity. That is, you don’t save
money fueling your car with electricity. If you compare a Prius to a
Tesla Model 3, which are about the same interior size, you don’t save
money when you switch to a Tesla Model 3, for fueling. That’s nuts. You
should be saving three-quarters of the cost of fueling by switching to
electricity. <br/> <br/> Likewise, when we start talking about heat
pumps, now, there’s one other aspect of this which is often not
appreciated. Not only are we overcharging for electricity, we are
undercharging for gasoline. So even with all the taxes — and I’ve done a
bunch of work on this — if you look at the price of gasoline almost
everywhere in the country … Actually, if you believe the social cost of
carbon is over $100 a ton, everywhere in the country, gasoline is
underpriced. We’re not charging enough to reflect the full cost. <br/>
<br/> So it’s even worse than just the overpricing of electricity. We’re
really putting our thumb on the scale in the wrong direction when it
comes to getting people to electrify transportation. And it’s also true
with natural gas, though to a lesser extent. If we’re going to consider
the social cost of carbon over $100 a ton, natural gas is also
underpriced pretty much everywhere in the country. <br/> <br/> So we
want people to adopt heat pumps. We want people to put in heat pump
water heaters. But we’re really sending economic signals to tell them
not to.

id="boeing-launches-nasa-astronauts-for-the-first-time-after-years-of-delays">Boeing
launches NASA astronauts for the first time after years of delays</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL — Boeing launched astronauts for the first time
Wednesday, belatedly joining SpaceX as a second taxi service for
NASA.</p>
<p>A pair of NASA test pilots blasted off aboard Boeing’s Starliner
capsule for the International Space Station, the first to fly the new
spacecraft.</p>
<p>The trip by Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams was expected to take 25
hours, with an arrival Thursday. They will spend just over a week at the
orbiting lab before climbing back into Starliner for a remote desert
touchdown in the western U.S. on June 14.</p>
<p>Years late because of spacecraft flaws, Starliner’s crew debut comes
as the company struggles with unrelated safety issues on its airplane
side.</p>
<p>Wilmore and Williams — retired Navy captains and former space station
residents — stressed repeatedly before the launch that they had full
confidence in Boeing’s ability to get it right with this test flight.
Crippled by bad software, Starliner’s initial test flight in 2019
without a crew had to be repeated before NASA would let its astronauts
strap in. The 2022 do-over went much better, but parachute problems
later cropped up and flammable tape had to be removed from the
capsule.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s launch was the third attempt with astronauts since early
May, coming after a pair of rocket-related problems, most recently last
weekend. A small helium leak in the spacecraft’s propulsion system also
caused delays, but managers decided the leak was manageable and not a
safety issue.</p>
<p>“I know it’s been a long road to get here,” NASA’s commercial crew
program manager Steve Stich said before the weekend delay.</p>
<p>Boeing was hired alongside Elon Musk’s SpaceX a decade ago to ferry
NASA’s astronauts to and from the space station. The space agency wanted
two competing U.S. companies for the job in the wake of the space
shuttles’ retirement, paying $4.2 billion to Boeing and just over half
that to SpaceX, which refashioned the capsule it was using to deliver
station supplies.</p>
<p>SpaceX launched astronauts into orbit in 2020, becoming the first
private business to achieve what only three countries — Russia, the U.S.
and China — had mastered. It has taken nine crews to the space station
for NASA and three private groups for a Houston company that charters
flights.</p>
<p>The liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station was the 100th of
an Atlas V for rocket maker United Launch Alliance. It was the first
ride for astronauts on an Atlas rocket since John Glenn’s Mercury era
more than 60 years ago; the rocket usually launches satellites and other
spacecraft.</p>
<p>Despite the Atlas V’s perfect record, the human presence cranked up
the tension for the scores of NASA and Boeing employees gathered at Cape
Canaveral and Mission Control in Houston.</p>
<p>Boeing’s Starliner and SpaceX’s Dragon are designed to be fully
autonomous and reusable. Wilmore and Williams occasionally will take
manual control of Starliner on their way to the space station, to check
out its systems.</p>
<p>If the mission goes well, NASA will alternate between SpaceX and
Boeing for taxi flights, beginning next year. The backup pilot for this
test flight, Mike Fincke, will strap in for Starliner’s next trip.</p>
<p>“When you have a new spacecraft, you need to learn all about it and
this has been a great exercise,” Fincke told reporters late last
week.</p>

Kim wins Democratic Senate primary in New Jersey</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Trenton, New Jersey — Representative Andy Kim won the Democratic
Senate primary in the U.S. state of New Jersey on Tuesday, putting him
in a strong position for the general election in the blue-leaning state.
The win comes a day after Democratic Senator Bob Menendez filed to run
as an independent amid his federal corruption trial. </p>
<p>Kim, a three-term congressman who launched his campaign after charges
against Menendez were announced last year, rose to the top in the
state’s dominant political party over a relatively short period. A
former Obama national security official, he defeated an incumbent
Republican in a 2018 House race and won a court ruling that toppled a
unique-to-New Jersey system widely viewed as giving political bosses
influence over who wins primaries. </p>
<p>“Our win today is a stunning victory for a people-powered movement
that mobilized against corruption and stood up to the machine politics
of New Jersey,” Kim said in a statement. </p>
<p>Kim’s victory comes after a bruising start to the primary, when a
battle between him and New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy began to take
shape. Murphy, a first-time candidate and the spouse of Governor Phil
Murphy, bowed out of the contest, saying she did not want to engage in a
negative campaign against a fellow Democrat. On Tuesday, Kim defeated
labor leader Patricia Campos-Medina and longtime grassroots organizer
Lawrence Hamm, who remained on the ballot. </p>
<p>Menendez, a three-term incumbent senator, declined this year to seek
re-election as a Democrat but filed Monday in Trenton to run as an
independent. He has said he hopes to be cleared of the charges this
summer. </p>
<p>Democrats’ tight hold on control of the Senate means they can hardly
afford a competitive race in a state widely viewed as safe for the
party. It’s unclear how the trial of Menendez will end and how his
candidacy could affect the race. Republicans are eager to exploit his
run as a wedge to divide the Democratic vote.</p>

id="china-us-nuclear-weapons-in-south-korea-would-undermine-its-security">China:
US nuclear weapons in South Korea would undermine its security</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — China said it opposes a deployment of nuclear weapons to
South Korea as it would pose danger to regional countries. Beijing was
reacting to a report suggesting the United States should take such a
measure to enhance deterrence against threats from North Korea. </p>
<p>“If the U.S. deploys tactical nuclear weapons in Asia-Pacific region,
it will be a dangerous move that will seriously threaten the security of
regional countries and undermine regional peace and stability,” said Liu
Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington. </p>
<p>“We will continue to handle Korean Peninsula affairs based on their
merits and our own position,” he said in a statement sent to VOA on
Monday. The embassy spokesperson described China’s position on the
Korean Peninsula as ensuring peace and stability and advancing political
settlement that suits the common interests of all parties. </p>
<p>The remarks were made in response to a report released May 29 by U.S.
Senator Roger Wicker, the highest-ranking Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, calling for a major boost to U.S. military buildup
and readiness against countries such as North Korea and China.</p>
<p>In the report, “Peace Through Strength,” Wicker suggested the U.S.
explore new options, such as a “nuclear sharing agreement in the
Indo-Pacific and re-deployment of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons in the
Korean Peninsula.”    </p>
<p>He said these would “bolster deterrence on the Korean peninsula” as
North Korea “continues to build more nuclear weapons and ballistic
missiles capable of striking the United States and our allies in the
Indo-Pacific.” </p>
<p>In response to Wicker’s report, a U.S. State Department spokesperson
told VOA’s Korean Service on Friday that “the United States does not
assess returning nuclear weapons to the Indo-Pacific as necessary at
this time” and “has no plans to forward deploy nuclear weapons to the
Korean peninsula.” </p>
<p>The spokesperson continued, “U.S. security commitments to allies and
partners in the Indo-Pacific region are steadfast and U.S. extended
deterrence commitments to the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Australia
remain ironclad.”  </p>
<p>In 1991, the U.S. withdrew from South Korea its nuclear weapons,
which had been stationed there since the late 1950s. The U.S. has been
providing extended deterrence commitment to South Korea and Japan, which
means the U.S. military would use its full range of capabilities,
including nuclear weapons, to defend its allies.  </p>
<p>Washington and Seoul will hold their third Nuclear Consultative Group
(NCG) meeting next week in Seoul to discuss ways to enhance extended
deterrence, South Korea’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday.   </p>
<p>The NCG was set up under the Washington Declaration announced in
April last year when U.S. President Joe Biden and South Korean President
Yoon Suk Yeol held a bilateral summit in Washington.   </p>
<p>On Sunday, after the U.S., South Korean and Japanese defense chiefs
met in Singapore, the three countries announced they will conduct their
first trilateral, multi-domain exercises, dubbed Freedom Edge, this
summer.   </p>
<p>Robert Peters, a research fellow for Nuclear Deterrence and Missile
Defense at the Heritage Foundation, told VOA via email, “The United
States should seriously consider redeploying nonstrategic nuclear
weapons to [South] Korea” as they would help strengthen deterrence. </p>
<p>Nonstrategic nuclear weapons refers to low-yield tactical nuclear
weapons designed to be used on the battlefield. </p>
<p>However, Thomas Countryman, who recently served as acting
undersecretary of arms control and international security under the
Biden administration, said “such a deployment would draw [South Korea’s]
attention away from building conventional capabilities that are more
essential to continued deterrence.” </p>
<p>Out of 200 tactical nuclear weapons the U.S. has in its active
inventory, 100 are located in Europe and the other 100 are stored as a
strategic reserve in the U.S, according to Bruce Bennett, a senior
defense analyst at the RAND Corporation. </p>
<p>“With the Russian aggression over Ukraine, it is hard to imagine the
United States taking any significant number of weapons out of Europe,”
said Bennett.   </p>
<p>“With China on the rise, the United States will be inclined to leave
its strategic reserve in the United States and certainly not deploy it
in South Korea where it could potentially be vulnerable to Chinese or
North Korean interdiction,” he continued. </p>
<p>Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and
weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said, “The
U.S. military opposes the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons or any
nuclear weapons to [South] Korea, because they would be vulnerable to a
North Korean attack.” </p>
<p>Japan would not object to the U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons in
South Korea “as long as they remain under U.S. control,” said David
Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy. “It is
only when South Korea develops its own nuclear weapons, would it
potentially kick off an arms race in the region.”</p>

House pushes cease-fire deal despite lack of enthusiasm from Israel,
Hamas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — Despite Israeli leaders pledging to continue military
operations until Hamas is destroyed and Hamas saying it cannot accept a
deal without Israeli commitment to a permanent cease-fire, mediators
from the United States, Egypt and Qatar continue to push through a
cease-fire proposal that President Joe Biden said last week had been
agreed to by Israel.</p>
<p>VOA White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara spoke with National
Security Council spokesperson John Kirby about why Biden chose to
announce the proposal instead of the Israelis, and what the challenges
are to reaching a truce in Gaza.</p>
<p>The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p>VOA: President Joe Biden announced the cease-fire proposal on behalf
of the Israelis, and then he rallied the G7 and the U.N. Security
Council to support it. Can you explain the thinking behind his
strategy?</p>
<p>National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby: It was important
to lay bare to the public what this proposal said, especially right
after it was transmitted to Hamas, so that everybody can see how
impactful this can be, so everybody can see what the eventual outcome
might be, which is a permanent cessation of hostilities as a possibility
from Phase Two. Also, because we want to make sure that Hamas knows that
the world now knows what’s in this proposal and what’s at stake.</p>
<p>VOA: Is the strategy partly to empower Prime Minister [Benjamin]
Netanyahu not to buckle under pressure from his right-wing governing
partners? How confident is the president that the Israelis will go
through with this?</p>
<p>Kirby: The Israelis have said it themselves – it’s their proposal,
they’re signing up to it, they’re acknowledging it, they’re owning it,
as they should. And we have every expectation that they’ll continue to
back this proposal because it is theirs and it is in their interest.
It’s also in Hamas’ interest. They say they want the war to end; this is
a path to end that war.</p>
<p>VOA: I understand what happens now is we’ll wait for the formal
response from Hamas, however …</p>
<p>Kirby: Well, look, there could be some bartering and negotiations
going forward. We’ll see what Hamas comes back with.</p>
<p>VOA: The U.S. has said that it supports Israel’s goal to destroy
Hamas’ governing and military capabilities. Are the administration and
Israel aligned in terms of the parameters of what that means?</p>
<p>Kirby: We believe that we are aligned, that we both want to see the
hostages home. Certainly, the Israelis want that. We want to see a Gaza
that is not governed by Hamas. We want to see a Hamas that can’t
threaten Israel the way they did on Oct. 7. And we believe through our
conversations with our Israeli counterparts that they too want to see
the suffering in Gaza alleviated. Now, that said, they have a right and
responsibility to continue to go after Hamas. And we’re going to
continue to help them do that. How they do that matters, and we’re still
having conversations with them about what’s going on in Rafah.</p>
<p>VOA: We have the experience of Iraq, to understand what the
implications of rooting out the Baath Party means. Does our
understanding of that inform our strategy toward what Israel should do
with Hamas?</p>
<p>Kirby: We’re not trying to compare this to the Baath Party in Iraq in
that situation. These are totally two different situations. Look, we
agree with Israel, not on everything, certainly. But we agree with them
on the big things: They shouldn’t have to live next door to a terrorist
threat. They shouldn’t have to be victimized the way they were on the
7th of October. They shouldn’t have to see Gaza governed by Hamas. All
of those things are true. And we’re going to continue to work with them
to defeat that threat. At the same time, it’s important for this war to
come to an end, as the president said, and the best way to do that is to
get those hostages out because that leads to a temporary cease-fire,
which can lead to a more permanent cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>VOA: Phase One is a six-week full and complete cease-fire, according
to the president. Can Israel target Hamas leaders during this time?</p>
<p>Kirby: They are allowed to continue, of course, their operations in
Rafah unless or until we get a cease-fire in place. If we can get this
hostage deal inked, if Hamas agrees to it, then an immediate cease-fire
takes place for six weeks. And that means that there will be no military
operations in Rafah or anywhere else in Gaza.</p>
<p>VOA: Including targeting of Hamas leaders?</p>
<p>Kirby: The fighting comes to an end for the period of the
cease-fire.</p>
<p>VOA: Including on targets?</p>
<p>Kirby: The fighting comes to an end.</p>
<p>VOA: You said the Israel Defense Forces’ recent actions in Rafah have
not reached your definition of a major ground operation, which the U.S.
does not support without credible Israeli plans to protect civilians.
But hundreds have been killed just in recent days, and a million people
have fled from Rafah. Isn’t this, in effect, the same result that the
U.S. wants Israel to avoid?</p>
<p>Kirby: Look, we don’t want any civilian casualties, whether it’s from
a targeted operation, an airstrike or something bigger than that. The
right number of civilian casualties is zero. None of them are
acceptable, nor should they be acceptable. But we have not seen Israel
go into Rafah in a large, concerted, concentrated way. We have not seen
major ground operations in Rafah. They are doing what they said they
were going to do –going after Hamas leaders in a targeted, precise way.
We’re going to continue to watch this, obviously, and watch it
closely.</p>
<p>VOA: Why is a major ground operation the criteria for the U.S. red
line when most of the civilians have been killed in airstrikes? Why not
the number of civilian deaths as the red line, if you say that the
correct number is zero?</p>
<p>Kirby: The correct number is zero. And again, what we’ve told the
Israelis is what the president said: that if they go in a heavy-handed
way, major ground operations in Rafah in the population centers, that’s
going to cause us to have to relook at our own Gaza policy and the
support that we’re providing them. We have not seen them take that sort
of a step right now. And again, we’re watching it closely.</p>

<h2 id="panel-rejects-psychedelic-drug-mdma-as-a-ptsd-treatment">Panel
rejects psychedelic drug MDMA as a PTSD treatment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Federal health advisers voted Tuesday against a
first-of-a-kind proposal to begin using the mind-altering drug MDMA as a
treatment for PTSD, handing a potentially major setback to advocates who
had hoped to win a landmark federal approval and bring the banned drugs
into the medical mainstream. </p>
<p>The panel of advisers to the Food and Drug Administration sided 10-1
against the overall benefits of MDMA when used to treat post-traumatic
stress disorder. They cited flawed study data, questionable research
conduct and significant drug risks, including the potential for heart
problems, injury and abuse. </p>
<p>“It seems like there are so many problems with the data — each one
alone might be OK, but when you pile them on top of each other … there’s
just a lot of questions I would have about how effective the treatment
is,” said Dr. Melissa Decker Barone, a psychologist with the Department
of Veterans Affairs. </p>
<p>The FDA is not required to follow the group’s advice and is expected
to make its final decision by August, but the negative opinion could
strengthen FDA’s rationale for rejecting the treatment. </p>
<p>The vote followed hours of pointed questions and criticisms about the
research submitted on MDMA — sometimes called ecstasy or molly.
Panelists pointed to flawed studies that could have skewed the results,
missing follow-up data on patient outcomes, and a lack of diversity
among participants. The vast majority of patients studied were white,
with only five Black patients receiving MDMA, raising questions about
the generalizability of the results. </p>
<p>“The fact that this study has so many white participants is
problematic because I don’t want something to roll out that only helps
this one group,” said Elizabeth Joniak-Grant, the group’s patient
representative. </p>
<p>The FDA advisers also drew attention to allegations of misconduct in
the trials that have recently surfaced in news stories and a report by
the nonprofit Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, which
evaluates experimental drug treatments. The incidents include a 2018
report of apparent sexual misconduct by a therapist interacting with a
patient. </p>
<p>Lykos Therapeutics, the company behind the study, said it previously
reported the incident to the FDA and regulators in Canada, where the
therapist is based. Lykos is essentially a corporate spinoff of the
nation’s leading psychedelic advocacy group, the Multidisciplinary
Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, which funded the studies.
The group was founded in 1986 to promote the benefits of MDMA and other
mind-altering substances. </p>
<p>MDMA is the first in a series of psychedelics — including LSD and
psilocybin — that are expected to come before the FDA in the next few
years. The panel’s negative ruling could further derail financial
investments in the fledgling industry, which has mainly been funded by a
small number of wealthy backers. </p>
<p>MDMA’s main effect is triggering feelings of intimacy, connection and
euphoria. When used to enhance talk therapy, the drug appears to help
patients process their trauma and let go of disturbing thoughts and
memories. </p>
<p>But the panel struggled with the reliability of those results, given
the difficulties of objectively testing psychedelic drugs. </p>
<p>Because MDMA causes intense, psychological experiences, almost all
patients in two key studies of the drug were able to guess whether they
had received the MDMA or a dummy pill. That’s the opposite of the
approach generally required for high-quality drug research, in which
bias is minimized by “blinding” patients and researchers to whether they
received the drug under investigation. </p>
<p>“I’m not convinced at all that this drug is effective based on the
data I saw,” said Dr. Rajesh Narendran, a University of Pittsburgh
psychiatrist who chaired the panel. </p>
<p>Panelists also noted the difficulty of knowing how much of patients’
improvement came from MDMA versus simply undergoing the extensive
therapy, which totaled more than 80 hours for many patients. Results
were further marred by other complicating factors, including a large
number of patients who had previously used MDMA or other psychedelics
drugs recreationally.</p>

<h2 id="new-asylum-restrictions-at-us-mexico-border-explained">New
asylum restrictions at US-Mexico border explained</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. President Joe Biden announced an executive order on
Tuesday that will temporarily restrict asylum eligibility at the
U.S.-Mexico border whenever the number of migrants crossing unlawfully
or without authorization reaches a daily average of 2,500. </p>
<p>Biden’s executive order says those who cross into the country
illegally won’t be eligible for asylum unless there are extraordinary
reasons why they should be allowed to stay in the United States. </p>
<p>“These actions alone aren’t going to fix our immigration system, but
they can help us a good deal in better managing what is a difficult
challenge,” Biden said in his remarks at the White House.  </p>
<p>According to U.S. officials, the temporary asylum restrictions will
come into effect when the average daily border encounters exceed 2,500,
and they will be suspended when that number falls below 1,500. </p>
<p>These restrictions take effect immediately. Data first reported by
CBS News shows U.S. Border Patrol officials recorded 3,000 migrant
apprehensions on May 20, and an average of 3,700 per day during the
first 21 days of May.   </p>
<p>Who is affected? </p>
<p>Anyone, regardless of nationality, crossing unlawfully along the
southern border.  </p>
<p>While the restrictions are in effect, migrants who cross the southern
border and are processed for expedited removal will be referred for a
credible fear screening with an asylum officer only if they express a
credible fear of returning to their country — meaning “a fear of
persecution or torture” — or an intention to apply for asylum, explained
a Department of Homeland Security official.</p>
<p>Immigration advocates call this a shout test.  </p>
<p>“If you’re able to shout and claim asylum, then you might be able to
get through. But what we know is that people don’t always speak English.
They don’t always know that is the way that they have to seek safety,”
Amy Fischer, director of refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty
International USA, told VOA.  </p>
<p>Officials spoke on background, a method often used by U.S.
authorities to share information with reporters without being
identified. The DHS official also addressed a question about migrant
removal. </p>
<p>“[These measures] will apply both to individuals from our hemisphere
as well as eastern hemispheric migrants. In terms of returns to Mexico,
we will continue to return nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and
Venezuela per our previous arrangement,” a DHS official said.  </p>
<p>Exemptions </p>
<p>Certain migrants are exempt from these restrictions, including
unaccompanied children, victims of human trafficking, migrants facing
medical emergencies, and those with valid visas or other lawful
permission to enter the U.S.  </p>
<p>People who use lawful entry processes, like the U.S. Customs and
Border Protection’s CBP One mobile application or other designated
pathways, won’t be affected by this guideline.  </p>
<p>Consequences </p>
<p>Those who cross illegally when the restrictions are in place and do
not establish a reasonable probability of persecution or torture in
their country will be “promptly removed, and they will be subject to at
least a five-year bar to reentry and potential criminal prosecution,”
the DHS official said. </p>
<p>Why now? </p>
<p>During a call with reporters, officials from DHS and the Justice
Department said these restrictions were necessary in the face of the
summer, when migrant encounters typically increase.  </p>
<p>The tougher stance on border security is also a response to a
heightened concern over immigration among American voters ahead of the
November 5 elections.  </p>
<p>Criticism </p>
<p>Some Republicans said Biden is issuing this order considering the
upcoming presidential election. </p>
<p>“With an election just months away, the president hopes that issuing
an executive order will demonstrate that he cares about this crisis and
is trying to fix it,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the
Senate floor. </p>
<p>Immigration advocates strongly criticized the move, calling it “a
total gutting” of asylum protections.  </p>
<p>Fischer, of Amnesty International, said this executive order is going
to prevent more people from accessing asylum and make it more difficult
for people to articulate their claim.  </p>
<p>“[It] does not sort out people that have false or ineffective asylum
claims. What it does is, it sorts out the most vulnerable,” Fischer
added. </p>
<p>The ACLU says it will sue to stop the restrictions. </p>
<p>“We intend to challenge this order in court. It was illegal when
Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy
director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, in an email to
reporters. </p>
<p>Biden officials disagree, saying the United States will continue to
adhere to its international obligations and commitments. </p>
<p>“These steps will strengthen the asylum system, preventing it from
being overwhelmed and backed up by those who do not have legitimate
claims,”  the DHS official said. ” … But we are clear-eyed that today’s
executive actions are no substitute for Congress taking up and passing
the tough but fair bipartisan Senate bill, which would have
significantly strengthened the consequences in place at the border.”</p>

highs expected to fall as Southwest US bakes in first heat wave of
season earlier than usual</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>phoenix, arizona — The first heat wave of the season has arrived
earlier than usual across much of the U.S. Southwest, with dangerously
hot conditions that produced triple-digit temperatures on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Forecasters say temperatures are likely to top 110 degrees Fahrenheit
(43.3 Celsius) in some areas by Thursday.</p>
<p>By Wednesday afternoon, much of an area stretching from southeast
California to central Arizona will see “easily their hottest” weather
since last September, and record daily highs will be in jeopardy from
Las Vegas to Phoenix, the National Weather Service said.  </p>
<p>Excessive heat warnings were issued for Wednesday morning through
Friday evening for parts of southeast California, southern Nevada and
Arizona.</p>
<p>“Temperatures well above average for the time of year — some spots as
much as 10 to 20 degrees above average,” said Marc Chenard, a weather
service meteorologist in College Park, Maryland. He said unseasonably
hot weather was expected to spread northward and make its way into parts
of the Pacific Northwest by the end of the week.  </p>
<p>Tuesday’s highs reached 106 F (41.1 C) in Bullhead City, Arizona, 104
F (40 C) in Phoenix and 103 F (39.4 C) in Las Vegas. Highs in California
included 112 F (44..4) at Furnace Creek in Death Valley, 108 F (42.2 C)
in Needles and 104 F (40 C) in Palm Springs.  </p>
<p>In Las Vegas, the mercury was forecast to hit at least 108 F (42.2 C)
on Wednesday and could then go even higher, according to the weather
service.  </p>
<p>“A new record high looks almost certain for Las Vegas on Thursday
with an 80% chance of reaching 112 degrees (44.4 C). This would tie the
earliest date for reaching 110 degrees (43.3 C) which previously
occurred June 6, 2010,” the weather service said Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Forecast highs for Thursday included 120 F (48.8 C) at Furnace Creek
in Death Valley and 113 F (45 C) in Phoenix, the latter of which would
break a record high for the date of 111 F (43.8 C), set in 2016.  </p>
<p>The heat prompted the U.S. Border Patrol to issue a warning on Monday
after it confirmed that four migrants died last weekend from
heat-related causes while attempting to cross into the country in
southeast New Mexico, near El Paso, Texas.  </p>
<p>Anthony Good, the agency’s El Paso sector chief, urged migrants not
to risk the extreme heat.  </p>
<p>“The desert environment is extremely unforgiving, especially during
the summer months,” Good said. “We urge anyone considering crossing
illegally to understand the severe risks involved.”  </p>
<p>Fire crews were on high alert especially in Arizona, where fire
restrictions went into effect before Memorial Day in some areas and will
be ordered by Thursday across much of the western and south-central
parts of the state, authorities said.  </p>
<p>Fire forecasters at the Southwest Coordination Center in Albuquerque,
New Mexico, said typically it does not get this hot until mid- or late
June.</p>
<p>“It does seem like Mother Nature is turning up the heat on us a
little sooner than usual,” said Tiffany Davila, a spokesperson for the
Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management.</p>
<p>“We can’t back down from a fire just because it’s pushing 113 degrees
outside. But we do keep a close eye on everybody in the field. Make sure
they are keeping hydrated and taking more breaks than they normally
would,” she said.  </p>
<p>Last summer, Phoenix saw a record 31 straight days of at least 110
degrees F (43.3 C), stretching from the last day of June through the
entire month of July. At least 400 of the year’s 645 heat-related deaths
were during that period.  </p>
<p>Phoenix, Maricopa County and Arizona state officials are striving to
better protect people from ever higher temperatures. Those most in
danger from the heat are people outdoors, especially homeless people in
downtown areas who often lack sufficient access to things like water,
shade and air conditioning.  </p>
<p>This year, governments are setting aside more money to keep cooling
stations open longer and on weekends, including two that will stay open
overnight.  </p>
<p>Mayor John Giles of the city of Mesa, just east of Phoenix, said
officials are “committed to ensuring that those most vulnerable to heat
exposure have access to essential life-saving services, including
hydration and cooling stations and daytime respite centers.”</p>

filed in Wisconsin against attorneys, aide who worked for Trump in
2020</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Madison, Wisconsin — Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed
felony forgery charges Tuesday against two attorneys and an aide who
helped submit paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald
Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.</p>
<p>The charges were filed against attorneys Kenneth Chesebro, 62, and
Jim Troupis, 70, and former Trump aide Mike Roman, 51, who allegedly
delivered Wisconsin’s fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania
congressman’s staffer in order to get them to then-Vice President Mike
Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.</p>
<p>All three are due in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, according
to court records. They each face one felony count punishable by up to
six years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.</p>
<p>Troupis and Chesebro did not return voicemail messages left Tuesday.
Roman did not have an attorney listed in court records.</p>
<p>Kaul, a Democrat, has faced pressure to bring action against the 10
fake electors, who have yet to be charged with any criminal wrongdoing.
He has previously suggested that he was relying on federal investigators
while also not ruling out a state probe.</p>
<p>Kaul didn’t rule out filing more charges, saying that the
investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>“Our approach has been focusing on following the facts where they
lead,” he said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Tony Evers offered a one-word response to news of the
charges being filed: “Good.”</p>
<p>Electors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential
elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which
party’s electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in
December after the election to certify the outcome.</p>
<p>The fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment
filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020
election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the
Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in
Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Michigan and Nevada have also criminally charged fake electors.</p>
<p>Chesebro and Roman were among the 18 people indicted along with Trump
in August in a sprawling racketeering indictment in Georgia. They’re
accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn
the 2020 election in that state.</p>
<p>Chesebro in October pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy
to commit filing false documents after reaching a deal with Georgia
prosecutors. Roman has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy
charges related to a plan to have Republican electors meet and cast
Electoral College votes for Trump even though Biden had won Georgia.</p>
<p>The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis, who was Trump’s
attorney in Wisconsin, all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought
against them last year.</p>
<p>Documents released as part of those settlements showed that the
strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.</p>
<p>The complaint goes into detail largely citing those documents,
interviews and testimony given to Congress about how the fake elector
scheme was hatched.</p>
<p>The complaint details how Chesebro emailed a memo on Nov. 18, 2020,
to Troupis and others arguing that electors representing Trump should
meet on Dec. 14, 2020, to preserve the Trump-Pence electoral slate in
case a court or Legislature would determine them to be the winners.</p>
<p>Chesebro argued in a subsequent memo that the Trump electors could be
counted by Congress if court challenges to his loss were still pending.
Troupis sent both memos to the Trump White House, according to the
complaint.</p>
<p>On Dec. 9, 2020, Chesebro emailed Troupis a memo with instructions
for the Dec. 14, 2020, elector meetings. Two days later, Chesebro
emailed Trump aide Roman details of the plan, the complaint said.</p>
<p>During or around the time of the Dec. 14, 2020, meeting, Chesebro
sent a message to Troupis and Roman that said, “WI meeting of the ‘real’
electors is a go!!!,” the complaint said. Troupis responded with a
“thumbs up” emoji, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The complaint also details how the fake elector slate was delivered
to Chesebro from Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021, by
Alesha Guenther, a law student working part-time at the Republican Party
of Wisconsin. Roman told Guenther to deliver the paperwork only to
Chesebro.</p>
<p>“5 mins until I make the drop,” Guenther texted at one point,
according to the complaint. “I feel like a drug dealer.”</p>
<p>Once Chesebro was given the documents, he emailed Roman to let him
know he had them.</p>
<p>Roman then arranged for a congressional staff member to meet Chesebro
and take the document. Chesebro sent Roman a message confirming that it
had been done, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Trump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000
votes. Trump carried Wisconsin by a similar margin in 2016.</p>
<p>Government and outside investigations have uniformly found there was
no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020
election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the
election, particularly in Wisconsin.</p>

<h2 id="whats-even-better-than-building-new-wind-farms">What’s Even
Better Than Building New Wind Farms?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM3MjU1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNTAwOTk1MH0.EQDEmw-QH6WiQi-X5XXdSTjmCUmJ2ZO28yIkzBhljkI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s not easy to build a wind project. Many of the best spots for
generating wind power are already occupied by turbines. Even if you do
find a good one, then comes everything else — inflation in the supply
chain, convincing a local community that they want a wind farm near
them, leasing the land, and so on and so forth. The whole process
<a href="https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/e8-why-does-it-take-five-years-build-wind-farm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>can
take as long as five years</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
But what about just making an existing wind farm … better.
</p>
<p>
This option, known as repowering, is becoming more attractive to wind
developers and operators as existing wind assets age — operators get a
more efficient wind farm, and developers get to avoid the many headaches
of starting from scratch. The topic came up Tuesday, in fact, at the
American Council on Renewable Energy’s 2024 Finance Forum. There are
“some real opportunities for repower,” said David Giordano, BlackRock’s
global head of climate infrastructure, on a panel about scaling capital
to meet demand growth for renewables.
</p>
<p>
“When you repower a project, oftentimes you can utilize some of the
existing infrastructure. And that means that you can add new equipment
without the full cost of a greenfield development,” Eric Lantz, director
of the Wind Energy Technologies Office at the Department of Energy,
explained to me. When you install more modern equipment, he said, “you
have higher hub heights, you have larger rotors — you can capture more
energy from that site.”
</p>
<p>
Even if you tear down everything and rebuild from the ground up, Lantz
told me, repowering still means you can use the existing transmission
and interconnection, meaning developers can get more generation without
having to deal with infamously long interconnection queues, which can
impose yet more years on the energy development timeline.
</p>
<p>
Lantz
<a href="https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/242009754/Kitzing_et_al_2020_multifaceted_drivers_repowering_AAM.pdf" target="_blank">collaborated
on a 2020 research paper</a> with a trio of Danish wind researchers
(Denmark has one of the largest and most advanced wind power industries
in the world) and found that from 2012 to 2019, 38% of all wind energy
development projects in the country involved replacing old equipment as
opposed to building on new sites. Repowering can be attractive to both
developers and local communities, the researchers explained, because
larger and more efficient turbines can actually reduce the net number of
turbines on a given site while generating the same or even more power,
with less visual disruption and less maintenance required.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Last year, Wood Mackenzie estimated that repowering onshore
wind assets would lead to <em>more</em> installed capacity than new
offshore wind in 2025 and 2026. In 2022, the U.S. repowered 1.7
gigawatts of wind plants, mostly by upgrading rotors (blades) and
nacelle components like gearboxes and generators,
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/land-based-wind-market-report-2023-edition.pdf" target="_blank"><u>upping
their total capacity</u></a> to 1.8 gigawatts, according to the
Department of Energy. Average rotor diameter increased from 93 meters to
112 meters, adding on about the length of an 18-wheeler to the typical
rotor.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Repowering has been a favored strategy of some of the
biggest renewable developers, who have large and aging fleets of wind
turbines that often already occupy prime spots. At the massive Shepherds
Flat site in Oregon, for instance, Brookfield Renewable Partners
replaced more than 300 turbines — i.e. over 900 blades — with new ones
that were about
<a href="https://www.fcltglobal.org/case-study/brookfield/" target="_blank"><u>90
feet longer</u></a>, upping the site’s total generation
<a href="https://energyinfo.oregon.gov/blog/2023/2/6/wind-renewable-re-powered-and-recycled" target="_blank"><u>by
some 20%</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
At a proposed repowering in Southern California, Brookfield wants to
replace around 450 turbines with
<a href="https://mesarepower.brookfieldusprojects.com/" target="_blank">just
eight</a>, while a New York repowering increased generation by almost
30% “while maintaining the same number of units to minimize ground
disturbance,”
<a href="https://brookfieldrenewableus.com/news-press/brookfield-renewable-u-s-announces-completion-of-wind-repowering-projects-in-new-york-first-in-states-history/" target="_blank"><u>the
company said</u></a>. <strong><em></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
The rationale for repowering, like everything in energy, is a mixture of
mechanical and financial. Over time, wind turbines tend to degrade, with
actual power generation falling off. Even just by restoring a wind
farm’s initial generating capacity, repowering can increase output, with
newer, more advanced equipment, capacity can notably increase<strong>.
</strong>And when renewable developers have to answer to investors, that
cheaper generation can look quite attractive.
</p>
<p>
The energy developer NextEra plans to repower 1.4 gigawatts of its wind
projects through 2026, the company’s chief financial officer said in an
April earning call, and in January said that it had repowered a quarter
of its existing 24 megawatts of wind. At that time, NextEra chief
executive John Ketchum told analysts that the cost had been “roughly 50%
to 80% of the cost of a new build and starting a new 10 years of
production tax credits, resulting in attractive returns for
shareholders.”
</p>
<p>
“With over a decade to potentially qualify for repowering,” he added,
“it represents a great opportunity set.”
</p>
<p>
Looking at wind projects from before and after 2012, Scott Wilmot, an
executive vice president at Enverus Intelligence Research, calculated
that average capacity factor increased from around 30% to around 40%.
“Swapping new equipment right off the bat, you can get a plus-10
percentage point gain on capacity factor,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s the tax incentives. Repowering “resets” the production
tax credit that’s the lifeblood of the wind industry, allowing owners
and developers to claim it for another 10 years. When Enverus looked at
a hypothetical project that had been operational since 2011 and
repowered in 2023, it was possible that its production tax credit for an
additional 10 years could increase from $22 per megawatt to almost $28.
“It really does make the economics look quite attractive,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
“If you can get close to 10 percentage point capacity factor gain, you
blow pretty much any greenfield, new build project out of the water.”

<p>A new point release in the FreeBSD 14 series – the first one, in
fact, not counting 14.0. FreeBSD 14.1 adds SIMD implementations of
string and memory operations on amd64 in the C library to improve
performance, improvements to the sound system, such as device hotplug
support, and the latest versions of OpenZFS, clang/llvm, and OpenSSH.
FreeBSD 14.0 users can just upgrade to FreeBSD 14.1, or you can do a
fresh install, of course.</p>

Law Review Board Nukes Website Over Palestine Article</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;

<p>
“Eghbariah’s paper for the Columbia Law Review, or CLR, was published on
its website in the early hours of Monday morning. The journal’s board of
directors responded by pulling the entire website offline. […] According
to Eghbariah, he worked with editors at the Columbia Law Review for over
five months on the 100-plus-page text.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Regardless of your perspective on the ongoing crisis in Israel and
Palestine, this seems like a remarkable action: removing a
heavily-reviewed, 100+ page legal analysis because it discusses the
Nakba, the mass-displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Palestine
war.
</p>
<p>
The right thing to do would be to publish it - as the editors tried to
do - and allow legal discussion to ensue. Instead, the board of
directors chose to simply pull the plug on the website.
</p>
<p>
As one Columbia professor put it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“When Columbia Law Professor Herbert Weschler published his important
article questioning the underlying justification for Brown v. Board of
Education in 1959 it was regarded by many as blasphemous, but is now
regarded as canonical. This is what legal scholarship should do at its
best, challenge us to think hard about hard things, even when it is
uncomfortable doing so.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If nothing else, this is a reflection of how sensitive these issues are
in the current era, whose voices are allowed to be heard, and the
conflicts between different ideologies, even on university campuses.

air capture “hub” in Louisiana</u></a>, with construction to start in
2026.
</p>
<p>
Climeworks already operates the two largest direct air capture plants in
the world, both in Iceland. Its
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climeworks-orca-data-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture" target="_self"><u>first
commercial-scale plant</u></a>, Orca, was designed to capture 4,000 tons
of CO2 per year. Just last month, the company
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climeworks-mammoth-5-things-to-know" target="_self"><u>turned
on its second plant, Mammoth</u></a>, which at full capacity is supposed
to capture 36,000 tons per year. Now, Climeworks’ third generation
breakthrough paves the way for it to build a plant capable of capturing
one million tons per year, the company said — a nearly 28x increase.
</p>
<p>
Over the past five years, while Climeworks was building Orca and
Mammoth, it had also been stealthily developing the next generation tech
at its labs in Zurich and Basel with a 50-person team. Like the earlier
designs, the new system uses a specially engineered material called a
solid sorbent that attracts carbon dioxide molecules when air passes
through it. But the company has overhauled both the chemistry of the
sorbent and its structure. The new design has more surface area,
enabling it to grab twice as much CO2 from the air. The company also
said it expects the new sorbents to last three times as long as the
previous material.
</p>
<p>
In addition to a new sorbent, the gen 3 tech will also feature an
updated architecture described as “sleek modular cubes” that “increase
capture efficiency, reduce costs, and boost robustness.” The new cubes
will make the plants more compact, taking up half the footprint of an
older plant with similar capacity. Renderings feature seemingly taller,
boxier facilities compared to the earlier, more horizontally-oriented
design.

</p>
<p>
Climeworks has already tested a full-scale model of its new cubes and
says it has “confirmed the anticipated breakthrough in efficiency and
performance.” It’s hard to know what that means, since the company has
never shared its previous tech’s efficiency or performance. But halving
its energy use would be a big deal, as that’s one of the most expensive
parts of the process. Carbon is extremely dilute in the air, and these
machines consume massive amounts of electricity and heat to extract it.
</p>
<p>
The company said the breakthrough puts it on track to achieve the cost
reductions it has previously promised, with a goal of removing CO2 for
$400 to $600 per ton by 2030. (The price range accounts for potential
variations in the cost of electricity and CO2 storage in different
locations.) That’s about half the amount Climeworks charges today, but
it’s still expensive. Some carbon removal companies, like Lithos Carbon,
which does enhanced rock weathering, and Vaulted Deep, which buries
carbon-rich waste, have already sold credits for less than $400, so
Climeworks already faces steep competition to bring its costs down.
</p>

from Climeworks on its 2030 price estimate per ton of carbon.</em>

id="lawyers-begin-opening-statements-in-hunter-bidens-federal-firearms-case">Lawyers
begin opening statements in Hunter Biden’s federal firearms case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wilmington, Delaware — Lawyers are making opening statements Tuesday
in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden’s son Hunter in a
trial that is expected to feature testimony from his exes and highly
personal details about his struggle with addiction.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a
2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the
throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally
licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying
he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, on
Tuesday morning, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his
sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.</p>
<p>The proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors
that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024
election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he’s being
unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried
the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic
president’s son.</p>
<p>The trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New
York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity
underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024
campaign.</p>
<p>Jury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president’s home state,
where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the
family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in
Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>People just know the story of how Biden’s two young sons, Hunter and
Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby
girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney
general before he died at age 46 from cancer.</p>
<p>Some prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family
personally, others because they held both positive and negative
political views about the Bidens and couldn’t be impartial. Still, it
took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four
women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.</p>
<p>One potential juror who was sent home said she didn’t know whether
she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about
Hunter Biden based on media reports.</p>
<p>“It’s not a good one,” she said.</p>
<p>Another was excused because he was aware of the case and said, “It
seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what
and when.”</p>
<p>But much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun
ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors’ knowledge of
the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who
might want to regulate firearms — some of the very people Biden counts
as constituents.</p>
<p>The panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were
not made public.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges
of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been
resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of
a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.</p>
<p>But Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump,
questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed
guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a
diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed
out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.</p>
<p>The lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the
deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top
investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a
special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was
indicted.</p>
<p>Opening statements come as Garland faces members of the
Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been
investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been
at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter
Biden’s business dealings.</p>
<p>The Delaware trial isn’t about Hunter Biden’s foreign business
affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark,
embarrassing and painful memories.</p>
<p>The president’s allies are worried about the toll the trial may take
on the elder Biden, who’s long been concerned about his only living son
and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son’s painful past
mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while
he’s campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming
presidential debate with Trump.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, the president said he has “boundless love” for
his son, “confidence in him and respect for his strength.”</p>
<p>“I am the President, but I am also a Dad,” he said, adding that he
would have no further comment on the case. “Jill and I love our son, and
we are so proud of the man he is today.”</p>
<p>The first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday,
watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense
table, as did Hunter Biden’s wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The
president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home.
He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich,
Connecticut.</p>
<p>Aboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary
Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president’s
ability to do his job, and she replied, “Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>“He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his
job,” said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the
trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings
concluded.</p>
<p>Biden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the
rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this
week.</p>
<p>The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own
public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the
2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11
days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was
not using drugs.</p>
<p>If convicted, Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison,
though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and
it’s unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.</p>
<p>Trump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who
raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former
president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag
order.</p>

<h2 id="intel-unveils-lunar-lake-architecture-moves-ram-on-die">Intel
unveils Lunar Lake architecture, moves RAM on-die</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Hot on the heels of AMD, here’s Intel’s next-generation processor,
this time for the laptop market. Overall, Lunar Lake represents their
second generation of disaggregated SoC architecture for the mobile
market, replacing the Meteor Lake architecture in the lower-end
space. At this time, Intel has disclosed that it uses a 4P+4E (8 core)
design, with hyper-threading/SMT disabled, so the total thread count
supported by the processor is simply the number of CPU cores, e.g.,
4P+4E/8T. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech The most significant change in
Lunar Lake, however, has nothing to do with IPC improvements, core
counts, or power usage. No, the massive sea change here is that Lunar
Lake will do away with separate memory sticks, instead opting for on-die
memory at a maximum of 32GB LPDDR5X. This is very similar to how Apple
packages its memory on the M dies, and yes, this also means that as far
as thin Intel laptops go, you’ll no longer be able to upgrade your
memory after purchase. You choose your desired amount of memory at
purchase, and that’s what you’ll be stuck with. Buyer beware, I suppose.
We can only hope Intel isn’t going to default to 8GB.</p>

<h2 id="how-tony-stubblebine-turned-medium-around-in-the-ai-era">How
Tony Stubblebine turned Medium around in the AI era</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
This is a lovely piece about Tony Stubblebine, who, as it rightly says,
is doing an excellent job as the new CEO of Medium.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Under Stubblebine’s direction, Medium, a site known for its many
pivots, is finally being strategic about what it wants and where it’s
headed. Last year, it launched a Mastodon server for premium users, and
in March it demonetized AI-generated content on its platform. It is
solidly on the side of team human and is finally starting to see that
pay off.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I worked at Medium in 2016-2017, and I’ve known Tony since 2007. I
genuinely like Ev, too, but I think Tony was a fantastic choice of
leader, and that’s really bearing out in his choices over the last few
years. I was particularly happy when Medium launched its own Mastodon
instance to check out the network and help give it some cloud in certain
circles.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“It’s hard not to want to root for Medium. The assumption for more than
a decade has been that the way the internet has to work will be
determined by what makes the most money for a handful of companies. They
wanted us to post content, then they wanted us to share content, then
they wanted us to watch it endlessly, and now they want us to use their
AI, which will create a bubble we’ll live in forever.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I agree.

id="many-americans-still-shying-away-from-evs-despite-bidens-push-poll-finds">Many
Americans still shying away from EVs despite Biden’s push, poll
finds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Many Americans still aren’t sold on going electric for
their next car purchase. High prices and a lack of easy-to-find charging
stations are major sticking points, a new poll shows.  </p>
<p>About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they would be at least somewhat likely
to buy an EV the next time they buy a car, according to the poll by The
Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy
Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, while 46% say they are
not too likely or not at all likely to purchase one.  </p>
<p>The poll results, which echo an AP-NORC poll from last year, show
that President Joe Biden’s election-year plan to dramatically raise EV
sales is running into resistance from American drivers. Only 13% of U.S.
adults say they or someone in their household owns or leases a
gas-hybrid car, and just 9% own or lease an electric vehicle.  </p>
<p>Caleb Jud of Cincinnati said he’s considering an EV, but may end up
with a plug-in hybrid — if he goes electric. While Cincinnati winters
aren’t extremely cold, “the thought of getting stuck in the driveway
with an EV that won’t run is worrisome, and I know it wouldn’t be an
issue with a plug-in hybrid,″ he said. Freezing temperatures can slow
chemical reactions in EV batteries, depleting power and reducing driving
range.</p>
<p>A new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency requires that
about 56% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2032, along with at
least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars. Auto
companies are investing billions in factories and battery technology in
an effort to speed up the switch to EVs to cut pollution, fight climate
change — and meet the deadline.  </p>
<p>EVs are a key part of Biden’s climate agenda. Republicans led by
presumptive nominee Donald Trump are turning it into a campaign issue.
 </p>
<p>Younger people are more open to eventually purchasing an EV than
older adults. More than half of those under 45 say they are at least
“somewhat” likely to consider an EV purchase. About 32% of those over 45
are somewhat likely to buy an EV, the poll shows.  </p>
<p>But only 21% of U.S. adults say they are “very” or “extremely” likely
to buy an EV for their next car, according to the poll, and 21% call it
somewhat likely. Worries about cost are widespread, as are other
practical concerns.  </p>
<p>Range anxiety – the idea that EVs cannot go far enough on a single
charge and may leave a driver stranded — continues to be a major reason
why many Americans do not purchase electric vehicles.  </p>
<p>About half of U.S. adults cite worries about range as a major reason
not to buy an EV. About 4 in 10 say a major strike against EVs is that
they take too long to charge or they don’t know of any public charging
stations nearby.  </p>
<p>Concern about range is leading some to consider gas-engine hybrids,
which allow driving even when the battery runs out. Jud, a 33-year-old
operations specialist and political independent, said a hybrid “is more
than enough for my about-town shopping, dropping my son off at school’’
and other uses.  </p>
<p>With EV prices declining, cost would not be a factor, Jud said — a
minority view among those polled. Nearly 6 in 10 adults cite cost as a
major reason why they would not purchase an EV.  </p>
<p>Price is a bigger concern among older adults.  </p>
<p>The average price for a new EV was $52,314 in February, according to
Kelley Blue Book. That’s down by 12.8% from a year earlier, but still
higher than the average price for all new vehicles of $47,244, the
report said.</p>
<p>Jose Valdez of San Antonio owns three EVs, including a new Mustang
Mach-E. With a tax credit and other incentives, the sleek new car cost
about $49,000, Valdez said. He thinks it’s well worth the money.  </p>
<p>“People think they cost an arm and a leg, but once they experience
(driving) an EV, they’ll have a different mindset,’’ said Valdez, a
retired state maintenance worker. </p>
<p>The 45-year-old Republican said he does not believe in climate
change. “I care more about saving green” dollars, he said, adding that
he loves the EV’s quiet ride and the fact he doesn’t have to pay for gas
or maintenance. EVs have fewer parts than gas-powered cars and generally
cost less to maintain. Valdez installed his home charger himself for
less than $700 and uses it for all three family cars, the Mustang and
two older Ford hybrids.</p>
<p>With a recently purchased converter, he can also charge at a nearby
Tesla supercharger station, Valdez said.  </p>
<p>About half of those who say they live in rural areas cite lack of
charging infrastructure as a major factor in not buying an EV, compared
with 4 in 10 of those living in urban communities.  </p>
<p>Daphne Boyd, of Ocala, Florida, has no interest in owning an EV.
There are few public chargers near her rural home “and EVs don’t make
any environmental sense,″ she said, citing precious metals that must be
mined to make batteries, including in some countries that rely on child
labor or other unsafe conditions. She also worries that heavy EV
batteries increase wear-and-tear on tires and make the cars less
efficient. Experts say extra battery weight can wear on tires but say
proper maintenance and careful driving can extend tire life.  </p>
<p>Boyd, a 54-year-old Republican and self-described farm wife, said EVs
may eventually make economic and environmental sense, but “they’re not
where they need to be” to convince her to buy one now or in the
immediate future.</p>
<p>Ruth Mitchell, a novelist from Eureka Springs, Arkansas, loves her
EV. “It’s wonderful — quiet, great pickup, cheap to drive. I rave about
it on Facebook,″ she said.</p>
<p>Mitchell, a 70-year-old Democrat, charges her Chevy Volt hybrid at
home but says there are several public chargers near her house. She’s
not looking for a new car, Mitchell said, but when she does it will be
electric: “I won’t drive anything else.”</p>

This is an interesting business model: UK broadcasters are trading
unused ad space for equity in digital media startups, turning them into
venture-scale investors.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The move comes as broadcasters continue to face a tough economic
downturn where corporate clients have slashed spending on advertising –
which is traditionally seen as a bellwether of the economic climate.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The thing about venture investing is that it doesn’t have a short time
horizon: exits could easily be a decade away. So this is either a
deliberately long game or a really short-sighted move on behalf of the
broadcasters, who might not be prepared to hold a basket of liabilities
for that long. Of course, they could presumably sell the equity, but
that pressure on the secondary market would have the potential to drive
the startups’ share prices down. Really the broadcasters need to hold
onto their portfolios.
</p>
<p>
I’m very curious to see how this plays out. It’s definitely an
innovative way to use an otherwise illiquid asset (unsold ad space). I
want these broadcasters to survive, and I like the ecosystem-building
aspect of this, so I hope it all works out for everyone involved.

Yuan wants AI clones in meetings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Eric Yuan has a really bizarre vision of what the future should look
like:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Today for this session, ideally, I do not need to join. I can send a
digital version of myself to join so I can go to the beach. Or I do not
need to check my emails; the digital version of myself can read most of
the emails. Maybe one or two emails will tell me, “Eric, it’s hard for
the digital version to reply. Can you do that?” Again, today we all
spend a lot of time either making phone calls, joining meetings, sending
emails, deleting some spam emails and replying to some text messages,
still very busy. How [do we] leverage AI, how do we leverage Zoom
Workplace, to fully automate that kind of work? That’s something that is
very important for us.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The solution to having too many meetings that you don’t really need to
attend, and too many emails that are informational only, is to <em>not
have the meetings and emails</em>. It’s not to let AI do it for you,
which in effect creates a world where our avatars are doing a bunch of
makework drudgery for no reason.
</p>
<p>
Instead of building better business cultures and reinventing our work
rhythms to adapt to information overload and an abundance of busywork,
the vision here is to let the busywork happen between AI. It’s an office
full of ghosts, speaking to each other on our behalf, going to standup
meetings with each other just because.
</p>
<p>
I mean, I get it. Meetings are Zoom’s business. But count me out.

from the International Energy Agency released this morning concluded
that the world isn’t yet on track to triple renewable energy capacity by
2030 compared to 2022 levels – an ambitious goal set last year at COP28
in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But we’re
not hugely far off: In examining countries’ unofficial energy policies,
the IEA found we’re likely to increase renewable capacity by about 8,000
gigawatts by 2030, which is about 70% of the 11,000 GW goal. But these
policies aren’t set in stone. In fact, very few countries (just 14) have
included clear 2030 renewable targets in their climate action plans,
known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The IEA wants
countries to make these ambitions official when they revise those NDCs
next year, but also urges them to move quickly on things like permitting
and grid infrastructure expansion, and in general, aim higher. “The
tripling target is ambitious but achievable – though only if governments
quickly turn promises into plans of action,” said IEA executive director
Fatih Birol.

<p>
The report finds that “due to the unprecedented rise in summer
temperatures and higher rates of extreme heat events,” summer energy
bills have risen from an average cost of $476 in 2014 to a projected
$719 this year. Low-income households will feel this financial strain
the most because they spend a larger amount of their income (about 8%)
on energy. Startlingly, the survey found that the percentage of
customers that couldn’t pay their energy bills for one month or longer
jumped from 21.3% to 23.5% last year, which saw the hottest summer on
record. The largest increase was among households with children. The
report calls for more efforts to ensure houses are weatherized, and
installing heat pumps.

in crop production thanks in part to severe weather such as drought,
disease, and pests. One research group is

farmers opt for soy to limit losses as all crop prices slump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chicago — Mark Tuttle planted more soy and less corn on his northern
Illinois farm this spring as prices for both crops hover near three-year
lows and soybeans’ lower production costs offered him the best chance of
turning a profit in the country’s top soy producing state.</p>
<p>He even planted soybeans in one of his fields for a second straight
year, breaking the traditional soy-corn-soy rotation for field
management. He and many other farmers are hoping to just minimize
losses.</p>
<p>Planting more soy at a time of sputtering demand from importers and
domestic processors will only serve to drive prices lower, further swell
historically large global supplies and erode U.S. farm incomes already
poised for the steepest annual drop ever in dollar terms.</p>
<p>But Midwest farmers’ other main options — seeding more corn or
leaving fields fallow — could have resulted in even wider losses.</p>
<p>“There’s a better chance of making money with soybeans than there is
for corn right now,” Tuttle said. “But if we have another bigger crop,
prices are going to go lower and that’s not going to bode well for the
farmer.”</p>
<p>In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast farmers would
plant 86.5 million acres of soybeans nationwide this spring, the fifth
most ever. Some analysts expect soybean acres to increase by another
million acres or more as heavy rains close the window on corn
planting.</p>
<p>In nearby Princeton, Illinois, Evan Hultine also increased soy
plantings and scaled back corn. High production costs due in part to a
jump in interest rates looked likely to erode most or all of his corn
returns, while soybeans remained marginally profitable, he said.</p>
<p>The farm’s profits will likely be the thinnest in at least five
years, Hultine said.</p>
<p>In an annual early season crop budget estimate, University of
Illinois agricultural economists projected negative average farmer
returns in the state for both crops, though losses would be smaller for
soybeans.</p>
<p>Unprofitable crops </p>
<p>In northern Illinois, farmers could lose $140 per acre on average for
corn and $30 an acre for soybeans with autumn delivery prices of $4.50
and $11.50 a bushel, respectively, the analysis showed. Actual returns
vary significantly from farm to farm, however, depending on factors like
crop yields, the timing of grain sales and whether farmers own or rent
their land.</p>
<p>Fertilizer costs are down from highs last year, but crop prices are
also down, while land costs remain elevated and borrowing rates for
operating loans and equipment have jumped, likely forcing farmers to cut
expenses, the economists said.</p>
<p>When looking to cut costs, farmers often favor planting soybeans
rather than corn because they require less fertilizer and pesticides and
seed costs tend to be lower.</p>
<p>High interest rates have been a particularly painful expense
recently.</p>
<p>“If you’re borrowing $700 an acre to put a corn crop in at 7% to 8%,
you’re talking about some real dollars there just on the price of money.
You can put a bean crop in a lot cheaper. Your interest cost per acre
might be half,” Tuttle said.</p>
<p>More soy, less corn</p>
<p>An early-spring forecast from the USDA projected soy plantings would
expand by 3.5% this year while corn plantings were expected to shrink
4.9%.</p>
<p>The expansion is expected to swell the U.S. soy stockpile next season
by more than 30% to the highest in five years and the sixth highest
level on record as demand from the domestic and export markets is not
keeping pace with rising production, according to the USDA.</p>
<p>Now, rain-saturated fields in some areas could clip corn acres and
even further expand seedings of soybeans, which, unlike corn, can be
planted well into June without significant risk to yields.</p>
<p>Cash prices offered for the next corn and soybean harvest have
improved from earlier this spring in Spencer, Iowa, where Brent Swart
has been struggling to plant the last of his corn acres due to overly
wet weather. But neither crop pencils a profit at current prices.</p>
<p>Nearly a foot of rain over the past month, seven inches more than
normal, has left his fields too soggy for field work. Swart estimates
his remaining corn fields may not be in shape to plant until after his
planting deadline date of June 1, when crop insurance benefits begin to
drop with each day.</p>
<p>Swart’s best option in some of his fields may be to file an insurance
claim saying he was prevented from planting due to waterlogged soils.
Soybean prices remain some 40 cents a bushel under his estimated cost of
production, he said.</p>
<p>“If you switch to soybeans, you’re potentially looking at a loss. If
you prevent plant, you’re looking at more of a breakeven scenario,”
Swart said.</p>
<p>Only farmers with severe weather issues will be able to file for
insurance, however.</p>
<p>Weather delays and a favorable price versus corn could boost soy
plantings by 500,000 to 1 million acres above the USDA’s latest forecast
for 86.5 million, said Tanner Ehmke, lead economist for grains and
oilseeds at CoBank.</p>
<p>“The signal from the marketplace to the farmer right now is that, if
you have a doubt about your acreage, send those acres to soybeans,” he
said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
China and the United States have fired their opening salvos in a
critical minerals trade war. Over the past year, China has imposed
export controls on
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-export-curbs-choke-off-shipments-gallium-germanium-second-month-2023-10-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gallium</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-export-curbs-choke-off-shipments-gallium-germanium-second-month-2023-10-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>germanium</u></a>,
and
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-require-export-permits-some-graphite-products-dec-1-2023-10-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>graphite</u></a>
— all minerals necessary for energy transition technologies. Then in
May, the Biden Administration shot back with tariffs on critical mineral
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/what-are-bidens-new-tariffs-china-goods-2024-05-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imports</u></a>,
part of a package of trade protection measures to help shield domestic
manufacturers in strategic sectors, including the mineral industry. The
downstream consequence for energy transition technologies such as
electric vehicle batteries, however, is almost certainly higher prices.
</p>
<p>
In all likelihood, this critical mineral trade war will intensify, with
corresponding implications for U.S. industries that use these raw
materials. China’s next shot
<a href="https://rhg.com/research/us-china-trade-war-volume-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may</u></a>
be even tighter export controls on critical minerals, including minerals
for which the United States relies heavily on China. Such export
controls pose real — and serious — risks to downstream U.S. industries
for five key reasons.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Critical minerals underpin billions of dollars of U.S. economic
activity.
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>For example, the White House
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>assesses</u></a>
that U.S. consumption of rare earth elements worth $613 million affects
about $496 billion in downstream economic activity across core sectors,
from petroleum refining to automotive manufacturing. Critically, the
United States relies on China for
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-rare-earths.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly
70% </u></a>of its rare earth consumption. The United States also
depends substantially on China for other minerals — more than on any
other country. Of the 50 non-fuel mineral commodities for which the
United States relied on imports to meet more than 50% of its consumption
from 2019 to 2022,
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>China</u></a>
was the leading import source for 15. Because critical minerals are
necessary in applications affecting strategic sectors such as automotive
manufacturing and renewable energy, Chinese export controls would be
particularly disruptive and costly.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>It would be tough — if not impossible — for the U.S. to find other
sources for the volume of Chinese-produced minerals it consumes.
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>To illustrate, the United States does not produce any
arsenic metal, which is used to produce
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-arsenic.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gallium
arsenide semiconductors</u></a> for
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-gallium.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high-performance
electronics</u></a>. China supplied
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-arsenic.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>97%</u></a>
of America’s arsenic metal imports in 2022. If China were to restrict
arsenic metal exports to the United States, American manufacturers —
including semiconductor fabricators, which the Biden administration very
much wants to support — would likely struggle to find non-Chinese
suppliers able to meet their full needs. Multiply this across all of the
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many,
many minerals</u></a> China supplies to the U.S., and you get a major
problem.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Even if U.S. companies can source critical minerals outside China,
they’re probably still controlled by Chinese companies.
</h3>
<p>
For instance, Chinese companies have significant stakes in cobalt
reserves and production in the
<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-cobalt.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Democratic
Republic of the Congo</u></a>, the world’s largest holder of cobalt
reserves and producer of cobalt ore. There, the Chinese company CMOC
owns the Kisanfu project, which calls itself one of the world’s
“<a href="https://en.cmoc.com/html/2022/News_0701/60.html" target="_blank"><u>largest
and highest-grade undeveloped copper-cobalt projects</u></a>,” and
Chinese companies owned or financed
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/20/world/china-congo-cobalt.html" target="_blank"><u>15</u></a>
of the 19 cobalt-producing mines there as of 2020. Depending on the
extent to which the Chinese government requires overseas Chinese
companies’
<a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-export-control-law-explainer-china-briefing-news/#:~:text=The%20ECL%20also%20extends%20Chinese,to%20its%20export%20control%20provisions" target="_blank"><u>help
enforcing</u></a> mineral export controls, downstream U.S. industries
could be prevented from sourcing minerals produced by Chinese companies
outside China.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Higher global mineral prices <em>could</em> spur non-Chinese
producers to enter the mineral market — but these new entrants may
struggle in the long term.
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Plenty of new companies entered the rare earth industry
after China reduced export quotas and caused
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html" target="_blank"><u>record-high
rare earth prices</u></a> in
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-07-09/china-reduces-rare-earth-export-quota-by-72-in-second-half-lynas-says?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2010</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rareearth/china-cuts-rare-earth-export-quotas-u-s-concerned-idUSTRE6BR0KX20101228" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2011</u></a>.
But when prices fell in 2015 due to
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/02/25/169038/what-happened-to-the-rare-earths-crisis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lower-than-expected
demand</u></a>, many of these rare earth companies went
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankruptcy-molycorp/rare-earth-miner-molycorp-to-start-bankruptcy-sale-of-business-idUSKBN0UM2A820160108/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bankrupt</u></a>.
Ultimately, the success rate for rare earth projects entering production
between 2011 and 2021 was just
<a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169136823001439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>1.5%</u></a>.
Non-Chinese mineral producers may find it attractive to enter the market
amid artificially inflated prices from export controls, but whether
their business model will hold if and when prices fall again is
decidedly less sure. Importantly, China’s commanding production share
for many critical minerals enables it to influence global prices in its
favor. If a new global industry begins to flourish, a glut of cheap
Chinese minerals may not be far behind.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Non-Chinese mineral producers could face capital and technical
challenges ramping up production.
</h3>
<p>
Mines and refineries already operating near their maximum capacity would
have to invest millions or
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/glencore-plans-15-bln-investment-expand-peru-copper-mine-2023-05-30/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions</u></a>
of dollars to expand production capacity, which can take up to
<a href="https://www.mining.com/barrick-to-invest-2-billion-in-zambia-copper-mine-expansion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>five
years</u></a> from starting feasibility studies to commissioning new
production. For mines and refineries with the capacity to ramp up
production already available, that excess margin could be due to
long-standing
<a href="https://gigametals.com/site/assets/files/4861/2018-03-19-hpal.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>technical
issues</u></a> in processes like
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/metals/030321-nickel-hpal-technology-ev-batteries-emissions-environment-mining" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>adjusting
the temperature</u></a> during processing. Thus, non-Chinese mineral
supply may take some time — and a lot of money — to come online if China
imposes export controls.
</p>
<p>
The Chinese government has both the will and the capability to impose
mineral export controls — as evidenced by its prior and present use of
mineral trade restrictions, from banning exports of rare earth elements
to Japan in
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2010</u></a>
to imposing a blanket export ban on rare earth processing technology in
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-export-rare-earths-processing-technologies-2023-12-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2023</u></a>.
As U.S.-China competition intensifies, more Chinese export controls on
minerals could well follow, which would cause severe supply chain
disruptions given challenges sourcing sufficient non-Chinese mineral
supplies.
</p>
<p>
So, while it remains to be seen how China will retaliate to this new
round of U.S. mineral tariffs, the U.S. government should accelerate its
mineral stockpiling — including urging certain downstream U.S.
industries to stockpile — and its collaboration with partner countries
to improve the resilience and robustness of their mineral supply chains.
The U.S. government should tread carefully in deploying trade tools in
this critical minerals competition, and prepare accordingly for possible
Chinese responses.

drift to Republican Party stalls amid Gaza conflict</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The war in Gaza is shaking Muslim Americans’ political
loyalties ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.</p>
<p>Disenchanted by President Joe Biden’s embrace of Israel, many
Democratic-leaning Muslims who once backed him are now vowing to
withdraw their endorsement.</p>
<p>But it’s not just Muslim Democrats abandoning their once-preferred
candidate. Some Muslim Republicans are also wavering amidst their own
party’s support of Israel.</p>
<p>Mo Nehad, a Pakistani American Republican activist in Fort Bend
County, Texas, has seen up close the political effects of the Gaza
conflict on Muslim American voting.</p>
<p>In late 2020, Nehad, who is a small-business owner, police officer
and military warrant officer, helped found a grassroots group in a bid
to engage the local Muslim community with the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Initially focused on opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandates and mask
mandates, the group, called Muslim Americans of Texas, soon found a new
cause: a conservative backlash to sex and gender education policies in
local schools.</p>
<p>“We were essentially trying to tell the Muslim community, regardless
of what has happened in the past overseas, let’s focus on national
topics and events,” Nehad said in an interview. “And when you compare
what traditionally a Democratic-elected president has done and a
Republican-elected president has done [on national issues], a
Republican-elected president is much better for the Muslims.”</p>
<p>The advocacy paid off, he said. While the Fort Bend County Muslim
community remained solidly Democratic, a small number started crossing
party lines, mirroring a pattern seen across the country.</p>
<p>“These are people who go to the same masjid as I do, people who are
in the same home-school groups,” he said.</p>
<p>Then the war in Gaza broke out after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on
Israel, testing the political allegiance of Muslim Democrats and
Republicans alike, with both viewing their parties as equally
pro-Israel.</p>
<p>Many Muslim Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Biden in 2020
fumed over the president’s support for an Israeli military campaign that
has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a group of progressive Muslim activists launched a
campaign they labeled #AbandonBiden, inducing hundreds of thousands of
voters to vote “uncommitted” in key Democratic primaries in Michigan and
elsewhere. Members were also threatening not to vote for Biden in
November.</p>
<p>Republican-leaning Muslims, fewer in number, have not been as vocal.
While many are backing their party, its equally staunch support of
Israel has alienated some, according to Muslim activists and
experts.</p>
<p>Nehad said that while he intends to vote for former President Donald
Trump in November, some Republican Muslims are reconsidering their
stance and even “going back” to the Democratic Party, drawn by that
party’s stronger criticism of Israeli actions.</p>
<p>“They don’t want to vote for Republican candidates because the
Republican candidates do not want to go ahead and openly denounce what
Israel is doing,” Nehad said.</p>
<p>Drift to GOP stalls</p>
<p>Youssef Chouhoud, a political science professor at Christopher
Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, said the war in Gaza
appears to have paused if not blunted the recent Muslim drift to the
GOP.</p>
<p>Had the war not occurred, he said that as many as 40% of Muslim
Americans would have voted for the Republican presidential nominee in
November.</p>
<p>“I was fully expecting that,” Chouhoud, who studies Muslim American
voting behavior, said.</p>
<p>Now, he said he is not so sure.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if upwards of 40% are voting third party or
otherwise testing some vote that is not a two-party vote,” he said.</p>
<p>A recent poll by the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee and
The Truth Project showed that only 7% of Arab American voters plan to
vote for Biden and 2% for Trump, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein
receiving 25%.</p>
<p>How the Muslim vote will influence the outcome of the presidential
contest between Biden and Trump remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Numbering about 3.5 million, Muslims make up just 1% of the U.S.
population. In tight races in swing states with large Muslim
populations, though, their vote could potentially sway the outcome of
the election.</p>
<p>But American Muslims are a diverse lot, with interests and priorities
often as varied as the general electorate. While anger over the Gaza
conflict may have unified the community, it is not the only issue
driving their voting decision, said Saher Selod, director of research
for the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a Muslim American
research group in Dearborn, Michigan.</p>
<p>“We need to know if [some Muslim voters] are centering this issue as
a major driving force in terms of how they’re going to vote,” Selod said
in an interview. “Other groups, while they might support a cease-fire,
have other issues that that they’re going to vote on.”</p>
<p>VOA asked both the Biden and Trump campaigns about their outreach to
Muslim Americans and any steps to assuage their concerns over the Gaza
war.</p>
<p>In a statement, a Biden campaign spokesperson said, “The President
shares the goal of a just and lasting peace in the region. He’s working
tirelessly to that end.”</p>
<p>In a separate statement, the campaign’s Michigan director said the
Biden team is in contact with Arab American and Muslim groups in Detroit
and Dearborn. Both cities have large Muslim populations.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The
campaign has not publicly reached out to the Muslim community on the war
in Gaza, but Trump’s son-in-law, Michael Boulos, and a former Trump
administration official recently met with a group of Arab Americans and
Middle Eastern leaders in Michigan.</p>
<p>Historical patterns</p>
<p>Historically, Muslim American voters have oscillated between the two
major political parties. Socially conservative, most voted Republican in
the 1980s and 1990s, leading some party activists to hail them as
“natural” allies. In 2000, a majority backed Republican George W.
Bush.</p>
<p>That changed after the attacks of Sept. 11, as the Bush
administration’s increased scrutiny of the community amid its “war on
terror” sent Muslims flocking to the Democratic Party. In every
presidential election since 2004, Muslims have favored the Democratic
nominee.</p>
<p>But with memories of 9/11 fading in recent years, some Muslims began
to shift back to the Republican Party, driven by shared conservative
values such as opposition to abortion, gay marriage and LGBTQ-inclusive
policies in schools.</p>
<p>“This is the social conservatism within this community kind of
creeping up to the surface and guiding political decisions in light of a
lot of marquee policy debates,” Chouhoud said.</p>
<p>Some polls confirm this recent voting trend.</p>
<p>In October 2020, an Institute for Social Policy and Understanding
poll found 30% of Muslims approved of Trump’s job performance, up from
13% in 2018. </p>
<p>In November 2020, an Associated Press exit poll found that 64%
supported Biden and 35% backed Trump.</p>
<p>Other polls showed a more modest increase in Muslim support for
Trump.</p>
<p>Muslim support for Republican candidates continued into 2022. During
that year’s midterm elections, 28% of Muslims voted Republican, up from
17% during the 2018 midterms, while 70% voted Democratic, down from
81%.</p>
<p>Today, the Muslim voter base is firmly rooted in the Democratic
Party, though a significant slice leans Republican.</p>
<p>A recent Pew Research poll found that 66% of Muslim voters are
Democrats or lean Democratic, while 32% are Republicans or lean
Republican.</p>
<p>Three previous polls conducted by Pew had all shown lower-level
numbers of Republican or Republican-leaning Muslim voters, according to
Besheer Mohamed, a senior Pew researcher.</p>
<p>“There are certain issues where Muslims tend to align more with the
Republican Party, Mohamed said, noting positive views of religion and
skepticisms toward LGBTQ issues.  “Then there are other issues where
that’s not the case.”</p>
<p>Nehad, once an independent voter, is now a Republican. His political
pivot came after he ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for
constable where he said he felt pressured to champion policies that
clashed with his religious convictions.</p>
<p>This year, he stood as a Republican candidate for Fort Bend County
sheriff.</p>
<p>“Everything the Republican Party stands for, 70% of it aligns with my
beliefs and values,” Nehad said, in a drawl honed over more than 25
years of living in the Lone Star state. “But when I compare the same
with the Democratic Party, it’s only maybe 20 or 40%, if that.”</p>
<p>Zahoor Gire, another co-founder of the Muslim Americans of Texas,
said Muslim Americans “share conservative Republican values” such as
strong families, traditional marriage, traditional gender roles and
opposition to abortion.</p>
<p>“I had family members of my own that had voted Democratic before and
are now voting Republican,” Gire said.</p>
<p>Underscoring the renewed Muslim embrace of the Republican Party, he
said a record eight Republican Muslim candidates have run for office in
Texas this year.</p>
<p>“So that shows you the willingness of people to embrace this party
and then run for office through this party’s platform,” Gire said.</p>
<p>To many Muslim Republicans, Trump is not the anti-Muslim politician
as he is seen by others. They’ve defended his so-called “Muslim ban” as
a necessary national security measure rather than a religiously
motivated injunction.</p>
<p>But the Gaza war has become “the main issue” for Muslims in America,
Gire said. And with Trump urging Israel earlier this year to “finish
what they started,” his perceived support of Israel at the expense of
Palestinians is giving some Muslim Republicans pause.</p>
<p>Asked if he will support Trump in November, Gire said, “We need to
see very specifically what his foreign policies will be, what his stance
towards Muslim Americans will be.”</p>

<h2 id="rebalancing-our-rest-api-traffic">Rebalancing our REST API
traffic</h2>
<p>date: 2024-06-04, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Since we first launched our REST API around 2013 as a Labs project, it
has evolved well beyond a prototype into arguably Crossref’s most
visible and valuable service. It is the result of 20,000 organisations
around the world that have worked for many years to curate and share
metadata about their various resources, from research grants to research
articles and other component inputs and outputs of research.
</p>
<p>
The REST API is relied on by a large part of the research information
community and beyond, seeing around 1.8 billion requests each month.
Just five years ago, that average monthly number was 600 million. Our
members are the heaviest users, using it for all kinds of information
about their own records or picking up connections like citations and
other relationships. Databases, discovery tools, libraries, and
governments all use the API. Research groups use it for all sorts of
things such as analysing trends in science or recording retractions and
corrections.
</p>
<p>
So the chances are high that almost any tool you rely on in scientific
research has somewhere incorporated metadata through us.
</p>
<h2 id="optimising-performance">
Optimising performance
</h2>
<p>
For some time, we’ve been noticing reduced performance in a number of
ways, and periodically we have a flurry of manually blocking/unblocking
IP addresses from requesters that are hammering and degrading the
service for everyone else, and this is of course only minimally
effective and very short term. You can always watch out status page for
alerts. This is the current one about REST API performance:
<a href="https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv" target="_blank">https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv</a>.
</p>
<p>
As the number of users and requests has grown, our strategies for
serving those requests must evolve. This post discusses how we’re
approaching balancing the growth in usage for the immediate term and
provides some thoughts about things we could try in the future on which
we’ll update gladly take feedback and advice.
</p>
<h3 id="load-balancing">
Load balancing
</h3>
<p>
In 2018, we started routing users through three different pools
(<em>public</em>, <em>polite</em>, and <em>plus</em>). This coincided
with the launch of
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus">Metadata
Plus</a>, a paid-for service with monthly data dumps and very high rate
limits. Note that all metadata is exactly the same and real-time across
all pools. We also, more recently, introduced an <em>internal</em> pool.
Here’s more about them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>Plus</em>: This is the aforementioned premium option; it’s really
for ‘enterprise-wide’ use in production services and is not really
relevant here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Public</em>: This is the default and is the one that is struggling
at the moment. You don’t have to identify yourself and, in theory, we
don’t have to work through the night to support it if it’s struggling
(although we often do). <em>Public</em> currently receives around
<strong>30,000</strong> requests per minute.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Polite</em>: Traffic is routed to <em>polite</em> simply by
detecting a mailto in the header. Any system or person including an
email is being routed to a currently-quieter pool, this means we can
always get in touch for troubleshooting (and only troubleshooting).
<em>Polite</em> currently receives around <strong>5,000</strong>
requests per minute.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>Internal</em>: In 2021, we introduced a new pool just for our own
tools where we can control and predict the traffic. <em>Internal</em>
currently receives around <strong>1,000</strong> requests per minute.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The volumes of traffic across <em>public</em>, <em>polite</em> and
<em>internal</em> pools are very different and yet each pool has always
had similar resources. The purpose of each of these pools has been
long-established but our efforts to ask the community to use
<em>polite</em> by default have not been particularly successful and it
is clear that we don’t have the right balance.
</p>
<p>
The <em>internal</em> pool has been dedicated to our internal services
that have predictable usage and that have requests that are not
initiated by external users. The <em>internal</em> pool has arbitrarily
included reference matching but not Crossmark, Event Data, or
search.crossref.org, which all use the <em>polite</em> pool instead,
along with the community. We have the capacity on the <em>internal</em>
pool to shift all of this “internal” traffic across, and in doing so we
will create more capacity for genuine <em>polite</em> users and redefine
what we consider to be “internal”.
</p>
<p>
Creating more capacity on <em>polite</em> will also give us the
opportunity to load-balance requests to both <em>polite</em> and
<em>public</em> across the two pools. We are at a point where we cannot
eke more performance out of the API without architectural changes. In
order to buy ourselves time to address this properly, we will modify the
routing of <em>polite</em> and <em>public</em> and evenly distribute
requests to the two pools 50/50.
</p>
<p>
The <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> pools have equal resources at
the moment yet handle very different volumes of traffic (30,000 req/min
vs 5,000 req/min), and with the proposed changes to internal traffic the
<em>polite</em> pool would handle a fraction of this. The result would
look something like 31,000 req/min evenly distributed across
<em>public</em> and <em>polite</em>.
</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting">
Rate limiting
</h3>
<p>
Our rate-limiting also needs review. We track a number of metrics in our
web proxy but only deny requests on one of them - the number of requests
per second. On <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> we limit each IP
address to sending 50 req/sec and if this rate is exceeded users are
denied access for 10 seconds. These limits are generous and we cannot
realistically support this volume of request for all users of the
<em>public</em> or <em>polite</em> API.
</p>
<p>
However, when requests are taking a long time to return, we potentially
have a separate problem of high concurrency as hundreds of requests
could be sent before the first one has returned. We intend to identify
and impose an appropriate rate limit on concurrent requests from each IP
to prevent a small number of users from disproportionately affecting all
users with long-running queries.
</p>
<h3 id="longer-term">
Longer-term
</h3>
<p>
So, in the short-term we will revise our pool traffic as described
above. We’ll do that this week. Then we will review the current rate
limits and reduce them to something more reasonable for the majority of
users. And we’ll identify and introduce a rate limit for concurrent
requests from each user.
</p>
<p>
Longer-term, we need to rearchitect our Elasticsearch pools so that we
can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Reduce shard sizes to improve performance of queries
</li>
<li>
Balance data shards and replicas more evenly
</li>
<li>
Optimise our instance types for our workload
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="want-to-help">
Want to help?
</h2>
<p>
Thanks for asking!
</p>
<p>
Firstly, please, everyone, do always put an email in your API request
headers - while the short term plan will help stabilise performance,
this habit will always help us troubleshoot e.g. we can always contact
you instead of blocking you!
</p>
<p>
Secondly, we know many of you incorporate Crossref metadata, add lots of
value to it in order to deliver important services, and also develop
APIs of your own. We’d love any comments or recommendations from those
of you handling similar situations on scaling and optimising API
performance. You can comment on this post which is managed via our
Discourse forum. We’ll aslo be adding updates to this thread as well as
on status.crossref.org. If you’d like to be in touch with any of us
directly, all our emails are
<a href="mailto:firstinitiallastname@crossref.org">firstinitiallastname@crossref.org</a>.
