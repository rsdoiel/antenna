the third major cultural and educational center in Ukraine supported and
financed by the U.S. Embassy. America House Odesa was supposed to
open in early 2022, but Russia’s invasion changed those plans. Anna

<h2 id="decentralized-finance-isnt">Decentralized Finance Isn’t</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: David Rosenthal’s blog</p>
A major theme of this blog since 2014’s
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/economies-of-scale-in-peer-to-peer.html"><i>Economies
of Scale in Peer-to-Peer Networks</i></a> has been that decentralized
systems aren’t, because economic forces overwhelm the technologies of
decentralization. Last year I noted that this rule applied to
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/03/shadow-banking-20.html"><i>Shadow
Banking 2.0</i></a> based on Prof. Hilary Allen’s
<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=4038788"><i>DeFi: Shadow Banking
2.0?</i></a> which she summarizes thus:<br />
<blockquote>
TL;DR: DeFi is neither decentralized, nor very good finance, so
regulators should have no qualms about clamping down on it to protect
the stability of our financial system and broader economy.
</blockquote>
And also <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2112b.htm"><i>
DeFi risks and the decentralisation illusion </i></a> by Sirio Aramonte,
Wenqian Huang and Andreas Schrimpf of the Bank for International
Settlements who write:<br />
<blockquote>
While the main vision of DeFi’s proponents is intermediation without
centralised entities, we argue that some form of centralisation is
inevitable. As such, there is a “decentralisation illusion”. First and
foremost, centralised governance is needed to take strategic and
operational decisions. In addition, some features in DeFi, notably the
consensus mechanism, favour a concentration of power.
</blockquote>
Below the fold I look at new evidence that the process of centralizing
DeFi is essentially complete.<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span>

<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/defi-is-becoming-less-competitive-a-year-after-ftx-s-collapse-battered-crypto"><i>DeFi
Is Becoming Less Competitive a Year After FTX’s Collapse Battered
Crypto</i></a> Muyao Shen highlights the situation:<br />
<blockquote>
A small number of participants are dominating the world of decentralized
finance as the crypto sector, which seeks to replicate financial markets
without middlemen, still hasn’t recovered from FTX’s collapse a year
ago.<br />

from a “crypto-risk modeling company”</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Most categories in DeFi — from peer-to-peer lending to decentralized
exchanges — are seeing capital largely held in a few major projects,
according to data compiled by crypto-risk modeling company Gauntlet. The
firm used a popular measure of market concentration and competition
called the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl%E2%80%93Hirschman_index">Wikipedia</a>
explains the HHI thus:<br />
<blockquote>
HHI is calculated by squaring the market share of each competing firm in
the industry—expressed as either fractions, decimals, or whole
numbers—and then summing the resulting numbers … The result is
proportional to the average market share, weighted by market share. As
such, it can range from 0 to 1.0, moving from a huge number of very
small firms to a single monopolistic producer.

<blockquote>
Based on the metric, the most competition exists between decentralized
finance exchanges, with the top four venues holding about 54% of total
market share. Other categories including decentralized derivatives
exchanges, DeFi lenders, and liquid staking, are much less competitive.
For example, the top four liquid staking projects hold about 90% of
total market share in that category, according to Gauntlet.

<p></font> Shen provides a breakdown of the last 180 days revenue of
DeFi projects, which I reformatted into this table. It shows that the
top project, Lido, has 55% of the revenue, the top two have 2/3, and the
top four projects have 78%. This is clearly a highly concentrated
market, typical of cryptocurrency markets in general.<br /> <br /> Why
does the centralization of Defi matter? First, for all the bad things
concentration causes in general markets — see for example Matt Stoller’s
<a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/"><i>Big</i></a>. But more
importantly, because the technologies of decentralization impose massive
costs over and above those of equivalent centralized systems. The
incentive to pay these additional costs is to reap the profits
centralized systems sacrifice to regulation. If you are paying the costs
but not evading regulation, what is the point? I discussed this in
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/02/economic-incentives.html"><i>Economic
Incentives</i></a>.<br /> <br /> I’ve argued many times, most recently
to the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/09/brief-remarks-to-iosco-defi-wg.html">IOSCO
DeFi Working Group</a>, that regulators should ignore the alleged
“decentralization” of cryptocurrency systems and
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/12/dominoes.html">go after the major
players</a> in each area. With lawsuits against

criminal conviction of Binance and CZ</a>, the US regulators no longer
seem to be going after the small fry. Presumably, they used winning
against the small fry to build precedents they are now using against
bigger fish.<br /> <br /> If despite claims of “decentralization”
regulators can shut down the few big players in a market, the
decentralized systems will be paying the massive extra costs but not
reaping the unregulated profits. Of course, there is a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole">Whac-A-Mole</a>
aspect; kill a big player and one or more smaller players will get
bigger enough to be worth taking out. But it won’t take many of these
cycles for the market to get the message.<br /> <br /></p>

Time for probably the final housekeeping post of 2023. I doubt I’ll make
a new one in December but we’ll see.

<hr />
<p>
This site now runs on Kirby 4! I absolutely love Kirby, been using it to
run this site since 2017 and I also used it for countless other
projects. The
<a href="https://getkirby.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">new V4
has officially been released</a> earlier today and the upgrade process
went super smoothly. Only had to update 2 lines of code inside 1 single
file and that was it. Stoked about that.
</p>
<p>
Next up, as mentioned in a previous post, Craig Mod has a new book out
and copies are moving FAST. Signed copies have sold out in I think 24
hours and unsigned copies are also selling quickly. So if you want one,
<a href="https://shop.specialprojects.jp/products/things-become-other-things-1st-ed/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">I
suggest you act now and don't wait too long</a>.
</p>
<p>
Carl is
<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/099-supply" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">running
a campaign on Product Hunt</a> to spread the word about his 099. The
project itself is neat and Carl has put a lot of effort into it so if
you happen to be a PH user, just give it an upvote.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, an update from me: I’m busy as hell, working on way too many
things at once but also excited because it’s nice to have things to do,
plus Christmas is approaching fast and that puts me in a good mood 🎄

holiday expenses compound the stress that inflation and the end of
pandemic-related federal benefits have placed on household budgets. Also

<h2 id="hunter-biden-offers-to-testify-publicly-before-congress">Hunter
Biden Offers to Testify Publicly Before Congress</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hunter Biden on Tuesday offered to testify publicly before the U.S.
Congress in response to a subpoena from Republicans investigating nearly
every aspect of his business dealings as they pursue an impeachment
inquiry into his father, President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The Democratic president’s son slammed the inquiry as a “fishing
expedition” and refused to give closed-door testimony but said he would
“answer any pertinent and relevant question” in front of the House
Oversight Committee next month, setting up a potential high-stakes
face-off.</p>
<p>Representative James Comer of Kentucky, the chairman of the House
Oversight Committee, subpoenaed Hunter Biden in early November in the
inquiry’s most aggressive step yet and one that tests the reach of
congressional oversight powers. Comer’s office did not immediately
respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</p>
<p>So far, Republicans have failed to uncover evidence directly
implicating President Biden in any wrongdoing. But lawmakers insist
their evidence paints a troubling picture of “influence peddling” in the
Biden family’s business dealings, particularly with clients
overseas.</p>
<p>The subpoena demanded Hunter Biden appear before the Oversight
Committee for a deposition by mid-December. His uncle James Biden was
subpoenaed the same day, as well as former business associate Rob
Walker.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden’s attorney Abbe Lowell said in Tuesday’s letter that his
client had “misgivings about your motives and purpose” but had
previously offered to speak with the committee without a response.</p>
<p>“Your empty investigation has gone on too long wasting too many
better-used resources. It should come to an end,” Lowell wrote. “From
all the individuals you have requested depositions or interviews, all
you will learn is that your accusations are baseless. However, the
American people should see that for themselves.”</p>
<p>He offered to appear on December 13, the date named in the subpoena,
or another day next month.</p>
<p>The subpoenas were bitterly opposed by Democrats, and the White House
called for the subpoenas to be withdrawn. Richard Sauber, special
counsel to the president, wrote that the subpoenas are “irresponsible”
and the product of an overzealous House GOP majority that “weaponized
the oversight powers of Congress.”</p>
<p>Congressional Republicans are also probing the Justice Department’s
handling of a criminal investigation into Hunter Biden’s business
dealings. That long-running case had been expected to end with a plea
deal, but it imploded during a July plea hearing.</p>
<p>Hunter Biden is now charged with three firearms felonies related to
the 2018 purchase of a gun during a period he has acknowledged being
addicted to drugs. No new tax charges have been filed, but prosecutors
have indicated they are possible in Washington or California, where he
now lives.</p>

Insurance companies are making climate risk worse (28 Nov 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Insurance companies are making climate risk worse: How
to break the climate insurance doom-loop. Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent

(permalink) Conservatives may deride the “reality-based community” as a
drag on progress and commercial expansion, but even the most noxious
pump-and-dump capitalism is supposed to remain tethered to reality by
two unbreakable fetters: auditing and insurance:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community No matter how much
you value profit over ethics or human thriving, you still need honest
books – even if you never show those books to the taxman or the marks.
Even an outright scammer needs to know what’s coming in and what’s going
out so they don’t get caught in a liquidity trap (that is, “broke”), or
overleveraged (“broke,” again) exposed to market changes (you guessed
it: “broke”). Unfortunately for capitalism, auditing is on its deathbed.
The market is sewn up by the wildly corrupt and conflicted Big Four
accounting firms that are the very definition of too big to fail/too big
to jail. They keep cooking books on behalf of management to the
detriment of investors. These double-entry fabrications conceal rot in
giant, structurally important firms until they implode spectacularly and
suddenly, leaving workers, suppliers, customers and investors in a state
of utter higgeldy-piggeldy:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/29/great-andersens-ghost/#mene-mene-bezzle
In helping corporations defraud institutional investors, auditors are
facilitating mass scale millionaire-on-billionaire violence, and while
that may seem like the kind of fight where you’re happy to see either
party lose, there are inevitably a lot of noncombatants in the blast
radius. Since the Enron collapse, the entire accounting sector has
turned to quicksand, which is a big deal, given that it’s what
industrial capitalism’s foundations are anchored to. There’s a reason my
last novel was a thriller about forensic accounting and Big Tech:
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865847/red-team-blues But
accounting isn’t the only bedrock that’s been reduced to slurry here in
capitalism’s end-times. The insurance sector is meant to be an
unshakably rational enterprise, imposing discipline on the rest of the
economy. Sure, your company can do something stupid and reckless, but
the insurance bill will be stonking, sufficient to consume the expected
additional profits. But the crash of 2008 made it clear that the largest
insurance companies in the world were capable of the same wishful
thinking, motivated reasoning, and short-termism that they were supposed
to prevent in every other business. Without AIG – one of the largest
insurers in the world – there would have been no Great Financial Crisis.
The company knowingly underwrote hundreds of billions of dollars in junk
bonds dressed up as AAA debt, and required a $180b bailout. Still, many
of us have nursed an ember of hope that the insurance sector would spur
Big Finance and its pocket governments into taking the climate emergency
seriously. When rising seas and wildfires and zoonotic plagues and
famines and rolling refugee crises make cities, businesses, and homes
uninsurable risks, then insurers will stop writing policies and the doom
will become undeniable. Money talks, bullshit walks. But while insurers
have begun to withdraw from the most climate-endangered places (or crank
up premiums), the net effect is to decrease climate resilience and
increase risk, creating a “climate risk doom loop” that Advait Arun lays
out brilliantly for Phenomenal World:
https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-doom-loop/ Part of the
problem is political: as people move into high-risk areas (flood-prone
coastal cities, fire-threatened urban-wildlife interfaces), politicians
are pulling out all the stops to keep insurers from disinvesting in
these high-risk zones. They’re loosening insurance regs, subsidizing
policies, and imposing “disaster risk fees” on everyone in the region.
But the insurance companies themselves are simply not responding
aggressively enough to the rising risk. Climate risk is correlated,
after all: when everyone in a region is at flood risk, then everyone
will be making a claim on the insurance company when the waters come.
The insurance trick of spreading risk only works if the risks to
everyone in that spread aren’t correlated. Perversely, insurance
companies are heavily invested in fossil fuel companies, these being
reliable money-spinners where an insurer can park and grow your
premiums, on the assumption that most of the people in the risk pool
won’t file claims at the same time. But those same fossil-fuel assets
produce the very correlated risk that could bring down the whole system.
The system is in trouble. US claims from “natural disasters” are topping
$100b/year – up from $4.6b in 2000. Home insurance premiums are up
(21%!), but it’s not enough, especially in drowning Florida and Texas
(which is also both roasting and freezing):
https://grist.org/economics/as-climate-risks-mount-the-insurance-safety-net-is-collapsing/
Insurers who put premiums up to cover this new risk run into a paradox:
the higher premiums get, the more risk-tolerant customers get. When
flood insurance is cheap, lots of homeowners will stump up for it and
create a big, uncorrelated risk-pool. When premiums skyrocket, the only
people who buy flood policies are homeowners who are dead certain their
house is gonna get flooded out and soon. Now you have a risk pool
consisting solely of highly correlated, high risk homes. The technical
term for this in the insurance trade is: “bad.” But it gets worse:
people who decide not to buy policies as prices go up may be doing their
own “motivated reasoning” and “mispricing their risk.” That is, they may
decide, “If I can’t afford to move, and I can’t afford to sell my house
because it’s in a flood-zone, and I can’t afford insurance, I guess that
means I’m going to live here and be uninsured and hope for the best.”
This is also bad. The amount of uninsured losses from US climate
disaster “dwarfs” insured losses:
https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/hurricanes-floods-bring-120-billion-insurance-losses-2022-2023-01-09/
Here’s the doom-loop in a nutshell: As carbon emissions continue to
accumulate, more people are put at risk of climate disaster, while the
damages from those disasters intensifies. Vulnerability will drive
disinvestment, which in turn exacerbates vulnerability. Also: the
browner and poorer you are, the worse you have it: you are impacted
“first and worst”:
https://www.climaterealityproject.org/frontline-fenceline-communities As
Arun writes, “Tinkering with insurance markets will not solve their real
issues—we must patch the gaping holes in the financial system itself.”
We have to end the loop that sees the poorest places least insured, and
the loss of insurance leading to abandonment by people with money and
agency, which zeroes out the budget for climate remediation and
resiliency where it is most needed. The insurance sector is part of the
finance industry, and it is disinvesting in climate-endagered places and
instead doubling down on its bets on fossil fuels. We can’t rely on the
insurance sector to discipline other industries by generating “price
signals” about the true underlying climate risk. And insurance doesn’t
just invest in fossil fuels – they’re also a major buyer of municipal
and state bonds, which means they’re part of the “bond vigilante”
investors whose decisions constrain the ability of cities to raise and
spend money for climate remediation. When American cities, territories
and regions can’t float bonds, they historically get taken over and
handed to an unelected “control board” who represents distant creditors,
not citizens. This is especially true when the people who live in those
places are Black or brown – think Puerto Rico or Detroit or Flint. These
control board administrators make creditors whole by tearing the people
apart. This is the real doom loop: insurers pull out of poor places
threatened by climate disasters. They invest in the fossil fuels that
worsen those disasters. They join with bond vigilantes to force
disinvestment from infrastructure maintenance and resiliency in those
places. Then, the next climate disaster creates more uninsured losses.
Lather, rinse, repeat. Finance and insurance are betting heavily on
climate risk modeling – not to avert this crisis, but to ensure that
their finances remain intact though it. What’s more, it won’t work. As
climate effects get bigger, they get less predictable – and harder to
avoid. The point of insurance is spreading risk, not reducing it. We
shouldn’t and can’t rely on insurance creating price-signals to reduce
our climate risk. But the climate doom-loop can be put in reverse – not
by market spending, but by public spending. As Arun writes, we need to
create “a global investment architecture that is safe for spending”:
https://tanjasail.wordpress.com/2023/10/06/a-world-safe-for-spending/
Public investment in emissions reduction and resiliency can offset
climate risk, by reducing future global warming and by making places
better prepared to endure the weather and other events that are locked
in by past emissions. A just transition will “loosen liquidity
constraints on investment in communities made vulnerable by the
financial system.” Austerity is a bad investment strategy. Failure to
maintain and improve infrastructure doesn’t just shift costs into the
future, it increases those costs far in excess of any rational discount
based on the time value of money. Public institutions should discipline
markets, not the other way around. Don’t give Wall Street a veto over
our climate spending. A National Investment Authority could subordinate
markets to human thriving:
https://democracyjournal.org/arguments/industrial-policy-requires-public-not-just-private-equity/
Insurance need not be pitted against human survival. Saving the cities
and regions whose bonds are held by insurance companies is good for
those companies: “Breaking the climate risk doom loop is the best
disaster insurance policy money can buy.” I found Arun’s work to be
especially bracing because of the book I’m touring now, The Lost Cause,
a solarpunk novel set in a world in which vast public investment is
being made to address the climate emergency that is everywhere and all
at once: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause
There is something profoundly hopeful about the belief that we can do
something about these foreseeable disasters – rather than remaining
frozen in place until the disaster is upon us and it’s too late. As
Rebecca Solnit says, inhabiting this place in your imagination is
“Completely delightful. Neither utopian nor dystopian, it portrays life
in SoCal in a future woven from our successes (Green New Deal!),
failures (climate chaos anyway), and unresolved conflicts (old MAGA
dudes). I loved it.” Hey look at this (permalink) Portal – 1987 – MS-DOS

<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> The first transatlantic flight
powered only by what’s being called “sustainable aviation fuel” is due
to take off from London today. Plus, a Swedish court has ruled that the
country’s transport authority has to find a way to get license plates to
Tesla, because postal workers are on strike. Then, TikTok’s owner
ByteDance says it’s downsizing its gaming division.

<h2 id="is-ai-about-to-steal-your-job">Is AI About to Steal Your
Job?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Almost all U.S. jobs, from truck driver to childcare provider to
software developer, include skills that can be done, or at least
supplemented, by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), according
to a recent report.</p>
<p>GenAI is artificial intelligence that can generate high-quality
content based on the input data used to train it.</p>
<p>“AI is likely to touch every part of every job to some degree,” says
Cory Stahle, an economist with Indeed.com, which released the
report.</p>
<p>The report finds that almost one in five jobs (19.7%) — like IT
operations, mathematics and information design — faces the highest risk
of being affected by AI because at least 80% of the job skills those
positions require can be done reasonably well by GenAI.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that those jobs will eventually be lost to
robots.</p>
<p>“It’s important to recognize that, in general, these technologies
don’t affect entire occupations. It actually is very rare that a robot
will show up, sit in somebody’s seat to do everything that someone does
at their job,” says Michael Chui of the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI),
who researches the impact of technology and innovation on business, the
economy and society.</p>
<p>Indeed.com researchers analyzed more than 55 million job postings and
found that GenAI can perform 50% to almost 80% of the skills required in
45.7% of those job listings. In 34.6% of jobs listed, GenAI can handle
less than 50% of the skills.</p>
<p>Jobs that require manual skills or a personal touch, such as nursing
and veterinary care, are the least likely to be hard hit by AI, the
report says.</p>
<p>In the past, technological advances have mostly affected manual
labor. However, GenAI is expected to have the most effect on so-called
knowledge workers, generally defined as people who create knowledge or
think for a living.</p>
<p>But, for now, AI does not appear poised to steal anyone’s job.</p>
<p>“There are very few jobs that AI can do completely. Even in jobs
where AI can do many of the skills, there are still aspects of those
jobs that AI cannot do,” Stahle says.</p>
<p>Rather than replace workers, researchers expect GenAI to enhance the
work people already do, making them more efficient.</p>
<p>“This is something that, in many ways, we believe is going to unlock
human potential and productivity for many workers across many different
sectors of the economy,” Stahle says.</p>
<p>“There are a number of things that can happen,” Chui adds. “One is,
we simply do more of something we were already doing, and so imagine if
you’re a university professor or a teacher, and the grading can be done
by machine rather than you. You can take those hours and, instead of
grading, you can actually start tutoring your students, spending more
time with your students, improving their performance, helping them
learn.”</p>
<p>American workers need to begin using the new technology if they hope
to remain competitive, according to Chui.</p>
<p>“Workers who are best able to use these technologies will be the most
competitive workers in the workforce,” he says. “It was true before, but
it’s more true than ever, that we’re all going to have to be lifetime
learners.”</p>
<p>A survey developed by Chui finds that almost 80% of workers have
experimented with AI tools.</p>
<p>“One of the great powers of these generative AI tools, so far, is
they’ve been designed in such a way to make it easy for really anybody
to use these types of tools,” Stahle says. “I really believe that people
should be looking to embrace these tools and find ways to incorporate
them into the work that they’re already interested in doing.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, could one of the unexpected benefits of AI be more
efficient employees who work less?</p>
<p>“In general, Americans work a lot,” Chui says. “Maybe we don’t have
to work so long. Maybe we have a four-day work week … and so you could
give that time back to the worker.”</p>

‘Confident’ of Continued US Support for Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday he is confident
the United States will continue to provide support for Ukraine amid
divisions among U.S. lawmakers about approving more funding for the
Ukraine war effort.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters before the start of two days of talks with NATO
foreign ministers in Brussels, Stoltenberg lauded what he called the
unprecedented military support NATO allies have provided to Ukraine in
response to Russia’s invasion.</p>
<p>“The challenge now is that we need to sustain that support,”
Stoltenberg said.</p>
<p>He described supporting Ukraine as NATO’s obligation, saying that a
Russian victory in Ukraine would be both a “tragedy for Ukrainians” and
dangerous to NATO members.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg met with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken before
the start of the ministerial meeting.</p>
<p>“We will be strongly reaffirming our support for Ukraine as it
continues to face Russia’s war of aggression,” Blinken told reporters in
a joint appearance with Stoltenberg.</p>
<p>Wednesday, Blinken will lead the U.S. delegation to NATO member North
Macedonia, which is hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe or OSCE in its
capital Skopje later this week.</p>
<p>The United States is hosting the next NATO summit in Washington from
July 9 to 11, 2024.</p>
<p>Blinken will discuss priorities for the Washington meeting with his
counterparts as the alliance celebrates its 75th anniversary next
year.</p>
<p>NATO-Ukraine Council foreign ministers</p>
<p>The chief U.S. diplomat is also set to attend the first foreign
minister-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council as Kyiv aspires to be
a NATO member.</p>
<p>“The Council supports Ukraine’s close partnership with NATO,” said
Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs Jim O’Brien.
“Allies will continue to support Ukraine’s self-defense until Russia
stops its war of aggression,” he added.</p>
<p>The NATO-Ukraine Council was inaugurated at the NATO Summit in
Vilnius on July 12, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
other heads of member governments also in attendance.</p>
<p>It convened for the second time in late July to discuss Black Sea
security following Russia’s withdrawal from a deal overseeing grain
exports from Ukrainian ports.</p>
<p>The third meeting was held in October to discuss substantial
assistance to Ukraine and to ensure Ukraine’s forces are fully
interoperable with NATO.</p>
<p>The NATO-Ukraine Council is the joint body where Allies and Ukraine
sit as equal participants to advance political dialogue.</p>
<p>Western Balkans</p>
<p>One of the sessions at this week’s NATO foreign ministers’ meeting is
to address security and democracy in the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>“A stable, prosperous future for the Western Balkans must be based on
good governance, rule of law, multi-ethnic democracy, and respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms,” O’Brien said.</p>
<p>NATO officials have affirmed the alliance’s commitment to maintaining
a safe and secure environment while contributing to broader stability in
the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>The statement came in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy’s earlier warning this month, in which he conveyed information
suggesting that Russia has a plan for the destabilization of the
Balkans.</p>
<p>Speaking on Nov. 21 in Skopje, North Macedonia, during the final stop
of a tour of the Western Balkans, NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg
stated that the alliance closely monitors Russia’s activities in the
region. But he said there is currently no perceived military threat to
any NATO member in the area.</p>
<p>North Macedonia, OSCE</p>
<p>After the government of North Macedonia announced that it would
briefly lift a flight ban and permit the plane carrying Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov to land in Skopje for the OSCE ministerial,
Lavrov said on Monday he would attend the OSCE foreign ministers meeting
in North Macedonia if Bulgaria opened its air space to the Russian
delegation.</p>
<p>North Macedonia’s sanctions will remain in place against Russia for
all other flights.</p>
<p>Most European countries banned flights from Russia after its invasion
of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>O’Brien declined to comment on whether there will be any interaction
between Lavrov, should he attend the OSCE ministerial, and the U.S.
delegation but told VOA during a phone briefing that U.S. Secretary of
State Blinken will “have a good discussion with” OSCE counterparts about
U.S. “support for Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Some information for this story came from Reuters.</p>

from VM to Hierarchical Jails in FreeBSD</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeBSD has supported nesting of jails natively since version 8.0,
which dates back to 2009. Looking at the jail(8) man page, there is an
entire paragraph named Hierarchical Jails that explains the concept of
jail hierarchy well. It’s one of the many gems of FreeBSD that, although
not widely known or used, is, in my opinion, extremely useful.
BastilleBSD plays a central role in this article, and that’s a project
I’ve been hearing a lot about recently. I feel like the various BSDs are
currently hitting a stride, and there seems to be a lot of movement from
Linux to BSD at the moment.</p>

streams inside a system. It takes advantage of advanced features of the
Linux kernel to provide low latency, low footprint, and high performance
while being secure. It is the perfect tool to build an embedded system
or to securely share streams between containers. Linux audio and video
has come a long way, and PipeWire is part of that. Excellent work.</p>

<h2 id="this-company-just-put-the-air-in-apples-macbook-air">This
company just put the air in Apple’s MacBook Air</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>Frore Systems is a startup with $116 million in funding, and I’ve
shown you its first product before: the AirJet Mini is a piezoelectric
cooling chip that weighs just nine grams and is thinner than two US
quarters stacked together. Each nominally consumes one watt and can
remove 4.25 additional watts of heat. Here’s the question: what would
happen if Frore used those AirJets to cool a laptop that normally
doesn’t have a fan at all? What the company discovered — and I saw
firsthand — is that Apple’s M2 chip can run faster, for longer, with
Frore’s tech on board. Without it, a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air was like a
runner that can’t sprint indefinitely without running out of breath. But
with three AirJet Minis, the same laptop got a permanent second wind.
Frore’s AirJet coolers have been featured on YouTube channels like LTT
as well, and there’s no doubt in my mind these will be the future of
laptop cooling, especially in the thinner segment of the laptop market.
At least in thin laptops, AirJets are better in virtually every way than
fans, and provide far superior cooling compared to fanless designs
without adding bulk or noise. The only thing that sucks as an enthusiast
is that you can’t really modify an existing laptop yourself. Either this
company gets gobbled up by an OEM, or their products will make their way
in almost every thin laptop.</p>

Play keeps banning the same web browser due to vague DMCA notices</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: OS News</p>
<p>App developer Elias Saba has had some bad luck with Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedowns. His Android TV app
Downloader, which combines a web browser with a file manager, was
suspended by Google Play in May after several Israeli TV companies
complained that the app could be used to load a pirate website. Google
reversed that suspension after three weeks. But Downloader has been
suspended by Google Play again, and this time the reason is even harder
to understand. Based on a vague DMCA notice, it appears that Downloader
was suspended simply because it can load the Warner Bros. website.
Application stores are basically random number generators. The worst
possible applications, from non-functional garbage to ad-ridden gambling
games designed to prey on children, make up the bulk of what’s on offer,
but functional, useful applications spiral into Kafkaesque bureaucratic
dark holes. Being a mobile developer in 2023 is a nightmare.</p>

Official: AI Threat Demands New Approach to Security Designs</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The potential threat posed by the rapid development of artificial
intelligence (AI) means safeguards need to be built into systems from
the start rather than tacked on later, a top U.S. official said on
Monday.</p>
<p>“We’ve normalized a world where technology products come off the line
full of vulnerabilities and then consumers are expected to patch those
vulnerabilities. We can’t live in that world with AI,” said Jen
Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency.</p>
<p>“It is too powerful, it is moving too fast,” she said in a telephone
interview after holding talks in Ottawa with Sami Khoury, head of
Canada’s Centre for Cyber Security.</p>
<p>Easterly spoke the same day that agencies from 18 countries,
including the United States, endorsed new British-developed guidelines
on AI cyber security that focus on secure design, development,
deployment and maintenance.</p>
<p>“We have to look at security throughout the life cycle of that AI
capability,” Khoury said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, leading AI developers agreed to work with
governments to test new frontier models before they are released to help
manage the risks of the rapidly developing technology.</p>
<p>“I think we have done as much as we possibly could do at this point
in time to help come together with nations around the world, with
technology companies, to set out from a technical perspective how to
build these capabilities as securely and safely as possible,” said
Easterly.</p>

Data</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-28, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
<div style="float:right;margin:10px">
<p><a href="https://www.crossref.org/pdfs/stm-research-data-infographic-FINAL-4.pdf" title="Download PDF">
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2023/stm-research-data-infographic-FINAL-4.jpg" width="400"/>
</a></p>
</div>
</p>
<p>
STM, DataCite, and Crossref are pleased to announce an updated joint
statement on research data.
</p>
<p>
In 2012, DataCite and STM drafted an
<a href="https://www.stm-assoc.org/2012_06_14_STM_DataCite_Joint_Statement.pdf" target="_blank">initial
joint statement</a> on the linkability and citability of research data.
With nearly 10 million data citations tracked, thousands of repositories
adopting data citation best practices, thousands of journals adopting
data policies, data availability statements and establishing persistent
links between articles and datasets, and the introduction of data
policies by an increasing number of funders, there has been significant
progress since. It now seems appropriate to focus on providing updated
recommendations for the various stakeholders involved in research data
sharing.
</p>
<p>
The premise of the original joint statement still stands: most
stakeholders across the spectrum of researchers, funders, librarians and
publishers agree about the benefits of making research data available
and findable for reuse by others. This improves utility and rigor of the
scholarly record. Still, research data sharing is not yet a self-evident
step in the research lifecycle. We now have sufficient scholarly
communication infrastructure in place to bring about widespread change
and believe momentum is building for collective action.
</p>
<p>
It is in this context that DataCite, a global membership community
working with over 2800 repositories around the world, and STM, whose
membership consists of over 140 scientific, technical, and medical
publishing organizations, are issuing this joint statement. Crossref, a
nonprofit open infrastructure with over 18,000 institutional members
from 150 countries, joins this call, recognising the need for an
amplified focus on data citation. The aim of this statement is to
accelerate adoption of best practices and policies, and encourage
further development of critical policies in collaboration with a wide
group of stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
Signatories of this statement recommend the following as best practice
in research data sharing:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
When publishing their results, researchers deposit related research data
and outputs in a trustworthy data repository that assigns persistent
identifiers (DOIs where available). Researchers link to research data
using persistent identifiers.
</li>
<li>
When using research data created by others, researchers provide
attribution by citing the datasets in the reference section using
persistent identifiers.
</li>
<li>
Data repositories enable sharing of research outputs in a FAIR way,
including support for metadata quality and completeness.
</li>
<li>
Publishers set appropriate journal data policies, describing the way in
which data is to be shared alongside the published article.
</li>
<li>
Publishers set instructions for authors to include Data Citations with
persistent identifiers in the references section of articles.
</li>
<li>
Publishers include Data Citations and links to data in Data Availability
Statements with persistent identifiers (DOIs where available) in the
article metadata registered with Crossref.
</li>
<li>
In addition to Data Citations, Data Availability Statements (human- and
machine-readable) are included in published articles where appropriate.
</li>
<li>
Repositories and publishers connect articles and datasets through
persistent identifier connections in the metadata and reference lists.
</li>
<li>
Funders and research organizations provide researchers with guidance on
open science practices, track compliance with open science policies
where possible, and promote and incentivize researchers to openly share,
cite and link research data.
</li>
<li>
Funders, policymaking institutions, publishers and research
organizations collaborate towards aligning FAIR research data policies
and guidelines.
</li>
<li>
All stakeholders collaborate in the development of tools, processes, and
incentives throughout the research cycle to enable sharing of
high-quality research data, making all steps in the process clear, easy
and efficient for researchers by providing support and guidance.
</li>
<li>
Stakeholders responsible for research assessment take into account data
sharing and data citation in their reward and recognition system
structures.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We, the following signatories shall adopt and promote the relevant best
practices laid out above. We hope that our action inspires the
community, including researchers, research funders, research
institutions, data repositories and publishers, to join us in making it
easy for researchers to share, link and cite research data.
</p>

week, we all agreed, is so packed that it’s tough to keep track of
everything that’s happening.
</p>
<p>
There’s an obvious reason for this: The 2023 United Nations Climate
Change Conference, better known as COP28, kicks off in Dubai this week.
The two weeks of COP are like climate Christmas: Governments and private
companies alike can make announcements anytime, but the weeks
immediately preceding and succeeding COP provide a sort of aura that
makes everything seem just a little bit more noteworthy. This is,
without a doubt, a good thing. Unless there’s some kind of disaster
looming, climate news often takes a back seat to other issues. COP,
however, gives climate types an excuse to grab people by the ears and
force them to pay attention.
</p>
<p>
There’s an inevitable uptick in climate news each time the conference
rolls around, much of it from the conference itself. International
negotiators will, yet again, meet to hash out another climate deal, and
many of them have already made their agendas known. The U.S. and
European Union, for example, are
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-10/us-and-eu-lead-push-for-cop28-to-endorse-tripling-of-renewables" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leading</a>
a push to triple renewable energy capacity by the end of the decade.
Developing nations, meanwhile, will try to get their wealthy
counterparts to finalize a loss and damage fund created at last year’s
COP, but which has
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/loss-damage-fund-climate-cop28-disaster-extreme-weather-world-bank-f52dec84e0dc46054bde9391bbcd2f09" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">languished</a>
in limbo as rich governments
(<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-eu-blamed-climate-fund-break-down-world-bank/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including
the U.S. and EU</a>) haggled over what they owe. World leaders —
including the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/pope-francis-cop-28" target="_self">Pope</a>
— will address attendees throughout the conference, and you’ll probably
read stories about the various commitments countries around the world
are making in the interim. China is particularly interesting here: The
last time China and the U.S.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/xi-biden-climate-agreement-cold-war" target="_self">reached
a climate agreement</a> in the run-up to a major summit, we got the
Paris Agreement.
</p>
<p>
Expect analyst groups to release reports en masse about the state of
climate change over the next couple of weeks — like
<a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this
one</a>, released last week by the UN, taking stock of countries’
progress toward holding emissions below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Many
reporters (your Heatmap writers included) have already received many
more such reports under an embargo that lifts around the time COP kicks
off, opening the coverage floodgates.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the news that might not necessarily be timed for COP but
conveniently (or, for those of us trying to cover all of it,
<em>inconveniently</em>) falls within the same time frame. My colleague
Emily Pontecorvo has been waiting for the Environmental Protection
Agency to release new methane regulations that could significantly
reduce emissions from oil and gas operations, and for the Department of
the Treasury to clarify tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction
Act; releasing those guidelines during COP — even if they aren’t at all
related to the talks themselves — would give the Biden administration a
much-needed boost to its climate credentials as the conference gets
underway.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, everyone’s favorite love-to-hate-to-love-it electric car
company, Tesla, will make the first deliveries of its long-awaited — and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-gmc-hummer" target="_self">much-maligned</a>
— Cybertruck on Thursday, the first day of the conference. While this
has nothing to do with COP, it is, for better or worse, arguably the
most anticipated EV release since the Model 3.
</p>
<p>
There’s been a lot of back and forth lately in climate circles about the
value of COP — Christiana Figueres, the architect of the Paris
Agreement,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-06/paris-accord-architect-says-cop-is-a-circus-that-s-not-needed" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a>
it a “circus” — and many journalists I know expect there to be few
surprises from the conference this year. But the glut of news around COP
makes me think the conference provides something of value beyond just
the negotiations. Few if any other annual events generate quite this
burst of announcements across governments, think tanks, and private
industry, and for a couple of weeks each year climate change moves to
the forefront of our minds.
</p>
<p>
There’s something valuable in that, if a little quaint: Sooner or later,
all of this will be at the forefront of everyone’s minds at all times,
whether we like it or not.

<h2 id="trump-to-testify-again-next-month-in-civil-fraud-trial">Trump to
Testify Again Next Month in Civil Fraud Trial</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>After a scorching first turn on the witness stand, former President
Donald Trump plans to testify again next month in his civil fraud trial,
his lawyers said Monday. </p>
<p>He is to return December 11, defense attorney Christopher Kise
said.</p>
<p>Trump was called to testify last time by his adversaries in the
lawsuit, the New York attorney general’s office. This time, the
Republican 2024 presidential front-runner’s own lawyers will open the
questioning and can ask about a wider range of subjects than they could
on cross-examination.</p>
<p>Not that those limitations stopped Trump from lambasting the suit and
defending himself and his business against Attorney General Letitia
James’ claims. Her lawsuit says he and his company misled lenders and
insurers by giving them financial statements that greatly inflated his
asset values and overall net worth.</p>
<p>“I’m worth billions of dollars more than the financial statements,”
Trump insisted on the stand last time. “This is the opposite of fraud. …
The fraud is her.”</p>
<p>Now finishing its second month, the trial is putting a spotlight on
the real estate empire that vaulted Trump into public life and
eventually politics. He maintains that James, a Democrat, is trying to
damage his campaign.</p>
<p>Financial statements</p>
<p>At the heart of the case are Trump’s 2014-21 annual “statements of
financial condition,” which were used to help secure loans and other
deals.</p>
<p>A Trump Organization executive testified Monday that the company no
longer produces such statements.</p>
<p>The company continues to prepare various audits and other financial
reports specific to some of its components, but “there is no roll-up
financial statement of the company,” said Mark Hawthorn, the chief
operating officer of the Trump Organization’s hotel arm.</p>
<p>He wasn’t asked why the comprehensive reports had ceased but said
they are “not required by any lender, currently, or any
constituency.”</p>
<p>Messages seeking comment on the matter were sent to spokespeople for
the Trump Organization.</p>
<p>Hawthorn, a certified public accountant, has worked since 2016 for
the company’s Trump Hotels arm. Parent company Executive Vice President
Donald Trump Jr. testified earlier that Hawthorn is functioning as the
entire Trump Organization’s chief financial officer, calling him “the
finance guy within Trump world now” and saying the CPA “has taken on all
those decisional responsibilities.”</p>
<p>But Hawthorn said that statement was wrong, that using “the word
‘all’ makes it incorrect.”</p>
<p>Hawthorn was testifying for the defense, which argues that various
companies under the Trump Organization’s umbrella have produced reams of
financial documents “that no one had a problem with,” as lawyer Clifford
Robert put it.</p>
<p>A lawyer for James’ office, Andrew Amer, stressed that the suit is
about Trump’s overall statements of financial condition, calling the
other documents irrelevant.</p>
<p>Trump asserts that his wealth was understated, not overblown, on his
financial statements. He also says the numbers came with disclaimers
saying that they weren’t audited and that others might reach different
conclusions about his financial position.</p>
<p>Judge Arthur Engoron, who will decide the verdict in the nonjury
trial, has already ruled that Trump and other defendants engaged in
fraud. The current proceeding is to decide remaining claims of
conspiracy, insurance fraud and falsifying business records.</p>
<p>James wants the judge to impose over $300 million in penalties and to
ban Trump from doing business in New York — and that’s on top of
Engoron’s pretrial order that a receiver take control of some of Trump’s
properties. An appeals court has frozen that order for now.</p>

<h2 id="biden-convenes-new-council-on-supply-chain-resilience">Biden
Convenes New Council on Supply Chain Resilience</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden convened the new White House Council on
Supply Chain Resilience on Monday, where he announced new actions aimed
at strengthening America’s supply chain to lower costs for U.S.
families, while warning companies against taking advantage of inflation
by price gouging.</p>
<p>“We know that prices are still too high for too many things, that
times are still too tough for too many families,” Biden said. “But we’ve
made progress.”</p>
<p>Among the new 30 actions, the council invoked the Cold War-era
Defense Production Act, to ensure investments in domestic manufacturing
of medicines designated as key to American security. Some $35 million
has been earmarked to be invested in the production of materials for
injectable medicines.</p>
<p>It’s hoped that the initiatives lower overall costs for Americans and
ensure timely production and deliveries of goods.</p>
<p>Biden was joined by Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, who
said the U.S. is seeing lower inflation and fewer supply chain issues
since problems peaked during recovery from the COVID pandemic in
2021.</p>
<p>“The pandemic had led to the most profound and widespread set of
disruptions to our transportation systems since 9/11, including enormous
strain on our supply chains,” Buttigieg said. </p>
<p>Biden also announced a new agreement with “13 countries in the
Indo-Pacific” that is aimed at identifying supply chain bottlenecks
before they turn into more widespread issues.</p>
<p>The new council will be co-chaired by Lael Brainard, director of the
White House National Economic Council, and Jake Sullivan, the White
House national security adviser.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and
Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="first-lady-wants-holiday-visitors-to-feel-like-kids-again">First
Lady Wants Holiday Visitors to Feel Like Kids Again</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Step inside the White House during the holidays by walking beneath
the branches of a Christmas tree. Stroll along a hallway decorated with
oversized holiday candy and other sweets. See Santa’s sleigh and his
eight reindeer suspended above the grand foyer in dramatic fashion.</p>
<p>Jill Biden wants everyone who visits the White House during the
holidays to feel like a kid again.</p>
<p>“Each room is designed to capture this pure, unfiltered delight and
imagination” so visitors “see this time of year through the wondrous,
sparkling eyes of children,” the first lady said Monday at the first of
a month’s worth of holiday receptions.</p>
<p>“Magic, Wonder and Joy” is the theme this year, President Joe Biden’s
third in the White House.</p>
<p>The whimsical set of oversized decorations is meant to inspire the
feelings of awe and wonder that put children on joyful edge during the
holidays, White House aides said.</p>
<p>Throughout two public floors of the White House, the décor features
several nods to the 200th anniversary of the publication of the poem and
book commonly known as “’Twas the Night Before Christmas.” (The official
title is “A Visit from St. Nicholas.”)</p>
<p>The papier mache reindeer suspended in the foyer are “so cool,” she
said. “It’s like they’re leaping from the storybook’s pages. I don’t
know how you feel about it. I feel it’s just breathtaking.”</p>
<p>The Library of Congress provided samples of editions of the book from
the past 200 years that are on display in protective cases along the
ground floor corridor. The traditional gingerbread White House includes
a large sugar cookie replica of the book opened to a page that says
“Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.” Santa’s sleigh and
reindeer also fly above the cookie White House.</p>
<p>National Guard families, who joined the first lady as part of her
Joining Forces initiative to support military families, were among the
first members of the public to see the decorations. Children of these
and other military families were also being treated to a performance by
the cast of the North American tour of the Disney musical “Frozen.”</p>
<p>One of the first Christmas trees visitors see after entering the
White House is decorated with wooden gold star ornaments engraved with
the names of fallen service members.</p>
<p>The official White House Christmas tree, an 18.5-foot-tall
(5.6-meter-tall) Fraser fir, stands in its usual place in the Blue Room.
The massive tree highlights cheerful scenes, landscapes and
neighborhoods from across the country. A toy train runs around its
base.</p>
<p>The State Dining Room has been transformed into Santa’s workshop,
with elves’ workbenches, stools and ladders circling Christmas trees,
and tools and gifts-in-progress rounding out the décor.</p>
<p>The dining room is the customary stage for the gingerbread White
House, which was assembled using 40 sheets of sugar cookie dough for the
book and 40 sheets of gingerbread dough for the house, 90 pounds (41
kilograms) of pastillage, a cake decorating paste, 30 pounds (14
kilograms) of chocolate and 50 pounds (23 kilograms) of royal icing.</p>
<p>The library honors the tradition of bedtime stories with dangling
golden moons and shimmering stars; the China Room has been turned into a
sweet shop featuring baked goodies, and the Vermeil Room celebrates
music with a display of rotating big Marine Band figurines with
trumpets.</p>
<p>Glowing candles and stained glass in the Green Room celebrate faith,
and holiday craft-making is the theme in the Red Room, where a tradition
of featuring cranberries continues.</p>
<p>The official White House Menorah is on display in the Cross Hall
connecting the State Dining Room and the East Room, which is decorated
with trees and various advent calendars.</p>
<p>Ninety-eight Christmas trees, nearly 34,000 ornaments, over 22,000
bells and more than 350 candles were used in the decor, according to the
White House. Nearly 142,500 lights illuminate trees, garlands, wreaths
and other displays, and nearly 15,000 feet (4,600 meters) of ribbon are
part of it all.</p>
<p>Seventy-two wreaths sporting red ribbons adorn the north and south
exteriors of the building.</p>
<p>Some 300 volunteer decorators and designers spent a few days last
week gathering decorations from a warehouse. They spent Friday, Saturday
and Sunday putting the decorations in their proper places.</p>

North Korea Trying to Advance Nuclear Program With Satellite Launch</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States accused North Korea on Monday of using the
prohibited launch of a military spy satellite to try to advance its
nuclear weapons program, a charge Pyongyang denied.</p>
<p>“The DPRK is unabashedly trying to advance its nuclear weapons
delivery systems by testing ballistic missile technology in clear
violation of this council’s resolutions,” U.S. Ambassador Linda
Thomas-Greenfield told council members, using the abbreviation for North
Korea’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.</p>
<p>Pyongyang is prohibited by several Security Council resolutions from
carrying out nuclear or ballistic missile activity. Thomas-Greenfield
noted that North Korea has launched three Satellite Launch Vehicles this
year and 29 ballistic missiles, including four intercontinental
ones.</p>
<p>The United Nations said North Korea issued a pre-launch notification
to the Japanese Coast Guard about its space launch vehicle but failed to
issue airspace or maritime safety notifications to international sea and
air organizations about its November 21 launch, which flew directly over
Japan.</p>
<p>“The DPRK’s launches represent a serious risk to international civil
aviation and maritime traffic,” U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Khaled
Khiari said in his briefing. </p>
<p>Japan’s envoy condemned Pyongyang’s “appalling” and “reckless
behavior.”</p>
<p>“The international community must express grave concern over such an
irresponsible act by North Korea and take decisive action to address
it,” Ambassador Kimihiro Ishikane said.</p>
<p>South Korea’s envoy said the launch was far from peaceful, as its
northern neighbor claims.</p>
<p>“Any launch that uses ballistic missile technology, regardless of its
success or payload, can contribute to the further advancement of
ballistic missile technology, in particular ICBMs capable of delivering
nuclear weapons,” Ambassador Joonkook Hwang said. </p>
<p>North Korea’s envoy defended the launch.</p>
<p>“It is a legitimate and righteous exercise of the rights to
self-defense, which fully belongs to the legal sphere of our
self-defense,” Ambassador Kim Song told the council.</p>
<p>He attributed North Korea’s need for such technology to the United
States’ “hostile policy” toward his country and its joint military
exercises with Japan and South Korea.</p>
<p>Washington has repeatedly offered to open talks with Pyongyang
without pre-conditions.</p>
<p>“The DPRK can choose the time and the topic, but the DPRK needs to
make that choice,” Thomas-Greenfield said on Monday.</p>
<p>China’s deputy envoy said if Washington is sincere about talks, it
should build trust and stop engaging in “pressure tactics” such as the
joint military exercises.</p>
<p>The council last adopted a sanctions resolution on North Korea in
2017. Russia and China have used their veto or the threat of it to
prevent further council action.</p>
<p>Several council members also expressed concern about reported
military cooperation between North Korea and Russia.</p>
<p>Thomas-Greenfield said U.S. information indicates that Pyongyang has
provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment
and munitions for its war in Ukraine.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-netbsd-ramdisk-kernel">Building a NetBSD ramdisk
kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>When I used OpenBSD, I was a big fan of bsd.rd: a kernel that
includes a root file system with an installer and a few tools. When I
invariably did something bad to my root file system, I could use that to
repair things. bsd.rd is also helpful for OS updates. And there is only
a single file involved. On NetBSD however, there is usually no netbsd.rd
kernel installed, or even available by default. The facility is there,
it’s just not standard. To be fair, there are a number of architectures
that use kernels with a ramdisk for installation. Recently, I have been
toying with NetBSD on an Orange Pi 5. This is a 64-bit ARM board, using
the evbarm-aarch64 architecture. I am booting from an SD card (details
in a followup post) but once booted, the kernel does not see the card
any more, only the NVMe SSD. So my thoughts went back to bsd.rd and I
decided that I want one! Such a kernel seems like a very useful tool to
have, so if you’re running NetBSD – this guide will help you add it to
your toolbox.</p>

in Vermont Shooting of Palestinians Pleads Not Guilty</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>A man in the U.S. state of Vermont has pleaded not guilty to three
counts of attempted second-degree murder in connection to the shooting
of three college students of Palestinian descent.</p>
<p>The suspect, 48-year-old Jason Eaton, appeared by video from the
county jail at his arraignment hearing on Monday, which was held at the
Chittenden County Court in Burlington.</p>
<p>Eaton spoke only to confirm his identity. His attorney entered pleas
of not guilty, and the judge ordered Eaton to be held without bail,
pending a hearing that is expected to take place within the next few
days.</p>
<p>Police say Eaton shot the three men with a pistol near the University
of Vermont on Saturday evening, then ran away.</p>
<p>The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
are assisting Vermont authorities in the investigation.</p>
<p>The shootings will also be investigated by the U.S. Department of
Justice to determine if they amount to hate crimes, according to
Attorney General Merrick Garland.</p>
<p>The victims were reportedly speaking Arabic at the time, according to
the Institute for Middle East Understanding, a nonprofit pro-Palestinian
advocacy organization. Two of them were wearing a keffiyeh, a
traditional black-and-white checkered scarf commonly worn in the Middle
East, police said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden released a statement saying he was “horrified,”
and that his administration “will provide any additional federal
resources needed to assist in the investigation.” </p>
<p>“While we are waiting for more facts, we know this: There is
absolutely no place for violence or hate in America. Period. No person
should worry about being shot at while going about their daily lives,”
Biden said. </p>
<p>Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger joined Burlington Police Chief Jon
Murad at a press conference in which Weinberger thanked Biden for the
swift federal support the city has received for the investigation.</p>
<p>The victims have been Identified as Hisham Awartani, a student at
Brown University in Rhode Island; Kinnan Abdalhamid, a student at
Haverford College in Pennsylvania; and Tahseen Ahmed, who attends
Trinity College in Connecticut. All of the victims are 20 years old.</p>
<p>They were all transported to the intensive care unit of a local
hospital, where two of them were in stable condition, while the third
faces “much more serious injuries,” according to police.</p>

Partners Announce Task Force to Counter Flow of Money to Hamas</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. said Monday that after Hamas’ assault on Israel last month,
it and several allied nations established an international task force
aimed at countering the flow of money to the militant Palestinian group
and supporting anti-terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>The take</p>
<p>Since 1,200 people were killed in the October 7 attack, the U.S.,
U.K. and allies have sought to cut off funding for Hamas, which has been
designated a terrorist group by Washington and other governments.</p>
<p>Context</p>
<p>The task force will enhance sharing of financial intelligence on
terrorist-financing-related matters and will discuss best practices and
opportunities for additional actions and partnerships, the U.S. Treasury
Department said in a statement.</p>
<p>It will also strengthen relations between the financial intelligence
units (FIUs), public authorities and the private sector to address the
threat, the statement said.</p>
<p>The task force is made up of financial intelligence units from
Australia, Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, Israel, Liechtenstein,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland, the U.K. and the
U.S., as well as other units.</p>
<p>Since the October 7 attack, Washington has imposed several rounds of
sanctions on Hamas. It has targeted the group’s investment portfolio and
issued an alert to financial institutions on countering Hamas financing
while senior officials have discussed the group’s access to funds on
trips abroad.</p>
<p>Key quote</p>
<p>“The October 7 terror attacks on Israel served as a grave reminder of
a core mission of our FIUs: to detect, disrupt and prevent the financing
of terrorism,” the statement said.</p>

<h2 id="ev-sales-just-hit-their-highest-level-ever-in-the-u.s.">EV Sales
Just Hit Their Highest Level Ever in the U.S.</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDU3Mjk4NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNDkwMzUxMH0.t_p4qq8f0Ey4PEFvglH2_Set-FlZJvwBKCkBzwm-OqM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
In case you needed more convincing that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_blank">buyers
still like EVs just fine</a>, sales of electric and hybrid light-duty
vehicles in the U.S. rose to their highest-ever level in the third
quarter of 2023, according to data
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61004&src=email" target="_blank">released
Monday</a> by Wards Intelligence. Electric-powered vehicles (including
those that are hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and purely battery-powered) made
up 17.7% of all light-duty vehicle sales during that time period, while
sales of gas-powered light duty vehicles fell to an all-time low of 82%.
</p>
<p>
The diverging trends were driven in part by falling prices for cleaner
cars. The average cost of a battery-powered light-duty vehicle was just
a hair over $50,000 in the quarter, well below their
<a href="https://mediaroom.kbb.com/2023-07-11-Kelley-Blue-Book-Analysis-Average-New-Vehicle-Transaction-Price-in-June-Posts-Smallest-Annual-Gain-in-Nearly-4-Years" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">peak</a>
of $66,390 from the second quarter of 2022. That said, the numbers show
that for most people, cleaner driving is still a luxurious experience —
thanks in part to brands like Tesla and Rivian, battery-electric
vehicles now make up 34% of the total luxury vehicle market, but are
still just 2% of non-luxury sales.
</p>
<p>
For EVs to gain true mainstream adoption, those numbers will have to
change. As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo recently
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-cars-partisanship-problem" target="_blank">pointed
out</a>, most of the top EV-purchasing counties in America are among the
country’s wealthiest, and existing research points to a correlation
between income and EV early adopter status.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Regardless of who’s buying, though, the overall numbers are good. So far
in 2023, 15.8% of light-duty vehicles sold were hybrids or EVs, up from
12.3% in 2022, and 8.5% in 2021. Numbers like these point to real
momentum in the clean-driving space. As
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_blank">Jesse
Jenkins wrote</a> recently for Heatmap, all-electric vehicle sales have
grown by roughly a 60% annualized rate for the past six quarters —
that’s “fast enough to double EV sales every 14 months!”
</p>
<p>
I’m not saying EVs don’t face real obstacles in the consumer
marketplace, from
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/06/1186154285/major-sticking-point-to-buying-an-electric-vehicle-is-the-lack-of-public-charger" target="_blank">a
lack of charging stations</a> to

rancor</a> to
<a href="https://defector.com/tesla-cybertruck-sorry-piece-of-crap" target="_blank">comically
bad design</a>. But if these numbers aren’t enough to make you feel at
least a little bit of excitement, that’s on you.

Military: Somali Pirates Likely Behind Attempted Tanker Seizure</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>An attempted hijacking of a commercial vessel in the Gulf of Aden on
Sunday appears to have been carried out by armed Somali pirates and not
Yemeni Houthis, despite the firing of missiles from Houthi-controlled
territory in Yemen afterwards, the Pentagon said Monday.</p>
<p>“We’re continuing to assess, but initial indications are that these
five individuals are Somali,” said Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier
General Patrick Ryder.</p>
<p>“Clearly a piracy-related incident,” Ryder added.</p>
<p>A U.S. Navy warship responded to a distress call on Sunday from the
chemical tanker Central Park. The attackers were taken aboard the U.S.
warship Mason, the U.S. military said, and the Central Park and its crew
were safe.</p>
<p>There have been a series of attacks in Middle Eastern waters since a
war between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas broke out on
October 7.</p>
<p>Central Park is a tanker managed by Zodiac Maritime Ltd, a
London-headquartered international ship management company owned by
Israel’s Ofer family. The Liberian-flagged vessel was built in 2015 and
is owned by Clumvez Shipping Inc, LSEG data showed.</p>
<p>Ryder told reporters that U.S. Navy personnel fired warning shots
when the attackers were trying to escape, but there were no
injuries.</p>
<p>He added that there were three Chinese military ships in the area but
they did not respond. China’s embassy in Washington could not
immediately be reached for comment on the assertion.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has said that two ballistic missiles were later
fired from Houthi-controlled territory in the general direction of the
Mason and Central Park, but they landed about 10 nautical miles away
from the ships.</p>
<p>“It’s not clear to us who they were targeting exactly,” Ryder
said.</p>
<p>The attempted tanker hijacking followed a seizure of an
Israeli-linked cargo ship by Houthis, allies of Iran, in the southern
Red Sea last week.</p>

Carter Tributes Highlight Her Reach as First Lady, Humanitarian</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Hundreds turned out to salute Rosalynn Carter on Monday with the
former U.S. first lady and global humanitarian’s final journey from her
rural hometown to the Jimmy Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta as her
family began three days of memorials following her death at age 96. </p>
<p>The former president, who is 99 and has spent the past 10 months in
home hospice care, plans to attend a memorial church service Tuesday in
Atlanta for his partner of more than 77 years, The Carter Center
confirmed. Rosalynn Carter died November 19.</p>
<p>The tributes started Monday morning as Rosalynn Carter’s casket
traveled by motorcade through the Carters’ native Sumter County, where
well-wishers gathered along the route in their tiny hometown of Plains
and attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the college from which she
graduated in 1946.</p>
<p>Lyndea Brown drove to the short ceremony at Georgia Southwestern
State University from nearby Albany, saying she wanted to salute “a
remarkable woman” who attended local cancer benefits and fought for
rural health services.</p>
<p>“They were always real hometown people,” Brown said. “We don’t get
presidents and first ladies like that anymore, people who have true
hometown roots and understand what it’s like to grow corn and peanuts
and whatever else and to struggle over health care.”</p>
<p>During the stop at Rosalynn Carter’s alma mater, her four children —
Jack, Chip, Jeff and Amy — watched as wreaths of white flowers were
placed beside a statue of their mother on the campus where she founded
the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregiving to advocate for millions of
unpaid caregivers in American households.</p>
<p>Generations of the Carter family — including the former first lady’s
grandchildren and great-grandchildren — accompanied the hearse to
Atlanta, where she was to lie in repose as members of the public paid
respects Monday evening at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and
Museum.</p>
<p>Two funerals, set for Tuesday in Atlanta and Wednesday in Plains,
will be for invited guests. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill
Biden, longtime friends of the Carters, will lead the dignitaries
expected to attend the Atlanta service. Rosalynn Carter’s burial
Wednesday in Plains will be private.</p>
<p>The schedule, a product of detailed planning that involved the former
first couple, reflects the range of Rosalynn Carter’s interests and
impact. That includes her advocacy for better mental health treatment
and the elevation of caregiving, her role as Jimmy Carter’s closest
adviser and her status as matriarch of Plains and Maranatha Baptist
Church, where she and the former president served in various roles after
leaving the White House in 1981.</p>
<p>“All over the world, people are celebrating her life,” said Kim
Fuller, the Carters’ niece, while teaching a Bible lesson Sunday at
Maranatha. “And of course, we’re coming into a week now where we’re
going to celebrate even more.”</p>
<p>Some well-wishers began honoring Rosalynn Carter soon after her
death, including an uptick in visitors to the Carter Presidential Center
campus.</p>
<p>“Mental health is more openly talked about” because of Rosalynn
Carter’s work to reduce the stigma attached to the conditions, said
Brendan Green, a high school guidance counselor who came from
Chicago.</p>
<p>“She was a pioneer in that field,” Green said. “What a great
legacy.”</p>
<p>Elizabeth Laudig, a registered nurse from Dallas, said she drove 12
hours to be in Georgia this week, starting with the wreath-laying
ceremony in Americus. She said Rosalynn Carter’s emphasis on mental
health and caregivers was especially inspiring to her as a nurse. </p>
<p>“She just quietly went about the business of trying to make the world
a better place,” Laudig said. “You know, she was not a showy or
extravagant first lady, but she was humble, you know, kind, hardworking,
and got things done for people because she cared about people.”</p>
<p>After the motorcade arrived in Atlanta, the family joined staff at
the Carter Presidential Center for a short, private service.</p>
<p>The campus near downtown Atlanta includes the library and museum, and
the Carter Center, where scores of people waited in line outside to pay
their respects at the public viewing.</p>
<p>The former first couple founded the center in 1982 to champion
democracy, mediate international conflicts and fight disease in the
developing world. Their work around the world redefined what former
White House occupants can do after ceding political power.</p>
<p>Carter Center CEO Paige Alexander recalled Rosalynn Carter as a tough
and fiercely intelligent advocate who in every respect was her husband’s
“full and equal partner.”</p>
<p>“Her compassion, her ability to connect, her political savvy was
something that helped build the support for all of our programs over the
past 40 years,” Alexander told co-workers and the family.</p>
<p>The largest single service will be held Tuesday at Glenn Memorial
Church on the Emory University campus. Emory helped the former first
couple establish the Carter Center.</p>
<p>Besides the Bidens, Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband,
Doug Emhoff, have announced plans to attend. Also expected are former
President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, as well as former first ladies Laura Bush, Michelle Obama and
Melania Trump, according to the Carter Center.</p>
<p>Glenn is a Methodist congregation. The Carters married in 1946 at
Plains Methodist Church, where Rosalynn Carter attended growing up. She
joined her husband as a Baptist throughout their marriage.</p>
<p>Her final services at Maranatha will reflect their small-town
Protestant roots: Church members are invited and will eat a funeral meal
with the Carter family the day of the service.</p>

Off to Brussels as NATO Shores Commitment to Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States is joining member states from NATO this week in
renewing the alliance’s “steadfast commitment” to Ukraine in its fight
against Russia’s aggression, according to a senior State Department
official.</p>
<p>Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Brussels,
where foreign ministers from NATO will gather from November 27 to
29.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Blinken will lead the U.S. delegation to NATO member
North Macedonia who is hosting a meeting of foreign ministers from the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe or OSCE in its
capital Skopje later this week.</p>
<p>The United States is hosting the next NATO summit in Washington from
July 9 to 11, 2024.  Blinken will discuss priorities for the Washington
meeting with his counterparts as the alliance celebrates its 75th
anniversary next year.</p>
<p>NATO-Ukraine Council foreign ministers</p>
<p>The chief U.S. diplomat is set to attend the first foreign
minister-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council as Kyiv aspires to be
a NATO member.</p>
<p>“The Council supports Ukraine’s close partnership with NATO,” said
Jim O’Brien who is State Department’s Assistant Secretary for European
and Eurasian Affairs.  “Allies will continue to support Ukraine’s
self-defense until Russia stops its war of aggression,” he added.</p>
<p>The NATO-Ukraine Council was inaugurated at the NATO Summit in
Vilnius on July 12, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and
other heads of member governments also in attendance.</p>
<p>It convened for the second time in late July to discuss Black Sea
security following Russia’s withdrawal from a deal overseeing grain
exports from Ukrainian ports.</p>
<p>The third meeting was held in October to discuss substantial
assistance to Ukraine and to ensure Ukraine’s forces are fully
interoperable with NATO.    </p>
<p>The NATO-Ukraine Council is the joint body where Allies and Ukraine
sit as equal participants to advance political dialogue.</p>
<p>Western Balkans</p>
<p>One of the sessions at this week’s NATO foreign ministers’ meeting is
to address security and democracy in the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>“A stable, prosperous future for the Western Balkans must be based on
good governance, rule of law, multi-ethnic democracy, and respect for
human rights and fundamental freedoms,” O’Brien said.</p>
<p>NATO officials have affirmed the alliance’s commitment to maintaining
a safe and secure environment while contributing to broader stability in
the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>The statement came in response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy’s earlier warning this month, in which he conveyed information
suggesting that Russia has a plan for the destabilization of the
Balkans.</p>
<p>Speaking on November 21 in Skopje, North Macedonia, during the final
stop of a tour of the Western Balkans, NATO Secretary-General
Stoltenberg stated that the alliance closely monitors Russia’s
activities in the region.  But he said there is currently no perceived
military threat to any NATO member in the area.  </p>
<p>North Macedonia, OSCE</p>
<p>After the government of North Macedonia announced that it would
briefly lift a flight ban and permit the plane carrying Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov to land in Skopje for the OSCE ministerial,
Lavrov said on Monday he would attend the OSCE foreign ministers meeting
in North Macedonia if Bulgaria opened its air space to the Russian
delegation.</p>
<p>North Macedonia’s sanctions will remain in place against Russia for
all other flights.</p>
<p>Most European countries banned flights from Russia after its invasion
of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
<p>O’Brien declined to comment on whether there will be any interaction
between Lavrov should he attend the OSCE ministerial and the U.S.
delegation but told VOA during a phone briefing that U.S. Secretary of
State Blinken will “have a good discussion with” OSCE counterparts about
U.S. “support for Ukraine.”  </p>

new revolutionary workflow for a unified collection of citations: say
hello to the OpenCitations Index</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: Open Citation blog at Hypotheses.org</p>
<p>Blog post by Ivan Heibi (University of Bologna), Arianna Moretti
(University of Bologna) and Chiara Di Giambattista (University of
Bologna). In the past five years, the OpenCitations data has been
enriched with numerous new indexes of open citation data from different
sources. However, the quantity and diversification of the ingested
information have raised several issues, which recently made it essential
to conduct a complete revision of the ingestion workflow. The result was
a revolution in the way OpenCitations data is delivered. In this blog …

<h2 id="schatzkarten">Schatzkarten</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Schatzkarten
</h1>
<p>
Schatzkarten als Teil der Schätze sind wichtig, weil sie kleine Aufgaben
darstellen. Wenn das Ziel in der Nähe ist, sei es im Nachbarhex bei der
Reise Überland oder in einem Raum in der Nähe im Megadungeon, der Effekt
ist immer gleich.
</p>
<p>
Die Spielerinnen und Spieler freuen sich! Das ist das wichtigste.
</p>
<p>
Es ist eine Ablenkung von was auch immer Spielerinnen und Spieler sonst
vor haben. Ablenkung ist für mich eine wichtige Herausforderung im
Spiel. Wie sehr will ich als Spieler etwas? Wenn ich mich ständig
ablenken lasse, dann war es mir vielleicht eben doch nicht so wichtig.
</p>
<p>
Es ist eine Einladung, ein grösseres Risiko einzugehen. Meistens zeigt
die Schatzkarte ja in das unbekannte Gebiet. Haben wir noch genug
Trefferpunkte, Zaubersprüche und andere Ressourcen? Wollen wir es wagen?
</p>
<p>
Deswegen dürfen Schatzkarten nicht auf Schätze verweisen, die zu weit
weg sind oder die erst in einem halben dutzend Spielabenden erreicht
werden können. Zudem sind Schatzkarten ja eine Belohnung, deswegen
sollten die Fundorte nicht nochmal speziell geschützt sein, denn sonst
wäre der Schatz ja den neuen Wächtern zuzurechnen. Nein, falls es am Ort
neue Wächter hat, dann haben diese ebenfalls Schätze.
</p>
<p>
Soviel zur Vorrede. Für <a href="Horte">Horte</a> habe ich im Moment
folgende Liste:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Karte zu einem Grab einer verarmten Adligen oder eines verarmten
Adligen: dort hat es einen Ring mit einem Edelstein
</li>
<li>
Karte zu einem Grab einer Adelsfamilie: 1 Juwel und 3W6 Edelsteine
</li>
<li>
Karte zu einem Versteck von Herrschaftszeichen: 1W6 Juwelen (Krone,
Zepter, Ringe, Halskette, Armreif, Kelch)
</li>
<li>
Karte zu einem Versteck von Devotionalien: 1W6 Juwelen (Statuen,
Miniaturen, Kelche, Schüsseln, Ikonen, heilige Schriften)
</li>
<li>
Karte zu einem Versteck von Geflohenen: 1W6×1000 Gold
</li>
<li>
Karte zu einem Versteck für den Notfall: 2W6 Edelsteine, 2W6×10 Gold
</li>
<li>
Karte zu einer Schatztruhe: 1W6×1000 Silber, 1W6×1000 Gold, 1W6 Juwelen

Many of the world’s biggest economies have agreed to non-binding safety
standards for artificial intelligence. While the joint guidelines
address cybersecurity, they don’t extend to key issues like economic
disruptions or potential threats to humanity. We dig into what this
means as governments struggle to keep up with the pace of AI
development. Plus, nothing like a U.N. climate summit for pitching
expanded oil and gas deals.

AI fight (27 Nov 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links The real AI fight: Effective Accelerationists and
Effective Altruists are both in vigorous agreement about something
genuinely stupid. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in
history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications,
upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading
The real AI fight (permalink) Last week’s spectacular OpenAI soap-opera
hijacked the attention of millions of normal, productive people and
nonsensually crammed them full of the fine details of the debate between
“Effective Altruism” (doomers) and “Effective Accelerationism” (AKA
e/acc), a genuinely absurd debate that was allegedly at the center of
the drama. Very broadly speaking: the Effective Altruists are doomers,
who believe that Large Language Models (AKA “spicy autocomplete”) will
someday become so advanced that it could wake up and annihilate or
enslave the human race. To prevent this, we need to employ “AI Safety” –
measures that will turn superintelligence into a servant or a partner,
nor an adversary. Contrast this with the Effective Accelerationists, who
also believe that LLMs will someday become superintelligences with the
potential to annihilate or enslave humanity – but they nevertheless
advocate for faster AI development, with fewer “safety” measures, in
order to produce an “upward spiral” in the “techno-capital machine.”
Once-and-future OpenAI CEO Altman is said to be an accelerationists who
was forced out of the company by the Altruists, who were subsequently
bested, ousted, and replaced by Larry fucking Summers. This, we’re told,
is the ideological battle over AI: should cautiously progress our LLMs
into superintelligences with safety in mind, or go full speed ahead and
trust to market forces to tame and harness the superintelligences to
come? This “AI debate” is pretty stupid, proceeding as it does from the
foregone conclusion that adding compute power and data to the
next-word-predictor program will eventually create a conscious being,
which will then inevitably become a superbeing. This is a proposition
akin to the idea that if we keep breeding faster and faster horses,
we’ll get a locomotive:
https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/ As Molly
White writes, this isn’t much of a debate. The “two sides” of this
debate are as similar as Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Yes, they’re arrayed
against each other in battle, so furious with each other that they’re
tearing their hair out. But for people who don’t take any of this
mystical nonsense about spontaneous consciousness arising from applied
statistics seriously, these two sides are nearly indistinguishable,
sharing as they do this extremely weird belief. The fact that they’ve
split into warring factions on its particulars is less important than
their unified belief in the certain coming of the paperclip-maximizing
apocalypse: https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/effective-obfuscation
White points out that there’s another, much more distinct side in this
AI debate – as different and distant from Dee and Dum as a Beamish Boy
and a Jabberwork. This is the side of AI Ethics – the side that worries
about “today’s issues of ghost labor, algorithmic bias, and erosion of
the rights of artists and others.” As White says, shifting the debate to
existential risk from a future, hypothetical superintelligence “is
incredibly convenient for the powerful individuals and companies who
stand to profit from AI.” After all, both sides plan to make money
selling AI tools to corporations, whose track record in deploying
algorithmic “decision support” systems and other AI-based automation is
pretty poor – like the claims-evaluation engine that Cigna uses to deny
insurance claims:
https://www.propublica.org/article/cigna-pxdx-medical-health-insurance-rejection-claims
On a graph that plots the various positions on AI, the two groups of
weirdos who disagree about how to create the inevitable
superintelligence are effectively standing on the same spot, and the
people who worry about the actual way that AI harms actual people right
now are about a million miles away from that spot. There’s that old
programmer joke, “There are 10 kinds of people, those who understand
binary and those who don’t.” But of course, that joke could just as well
be, “There are 10 kinds of people, those who understand ternary, those
who understand binary, and those who don’t understand either”:
https://pluralistic.net/2021/12/11/the-ten-types-of-people/ What’s more,
the joke could be, “there are 10 kinds of people, those who understand
hexadecenary, those who understand pentadecenary, those who understand
tetradecenary [und so weiter] those who understand ternary, those who
understand binary, and those who don’t.” That is to say, a “polarized”
debate often has people who hold positions so far from the ones everyone
is talking about that those belligerents’ concerns are basically
indistinguishable from one another. The act of identifying these distant
positions is a radical opening up of possibilities. Take the indigenous
philosopher chief Red Jacket’s response to the Christian missionaries
who sought permission to proselytize to Red Jacket’s people:
https://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5790/ Red Jacket’s whole rebuttal is a
superb dunk, but it gets especially interesting where he points to the
sectarian differences among Christians as evidence against the
missionary’s claim to having a single true faith, and in favor of the
idea that his own people’s traditional faith could be co-equal among
Christian doctrines. The split that White identifies isn’t a split about
whether AI tools can be useful. Plenty of us AI skeptics are happy to
stipulate that there are good uses for AI. For example, I’m 100% in
favor of the Human Rights Data Analysis Group using an LLM to classify
and extract information from the Innocence Project New Orleans’ wrongful
conviction case files:
https://hrdag.org/tech-notes/large-language-models-IPNO.html Automating
“extracting officer information from documents – specifically, the
officer’s name and the role the officer played in the wrongful
conviction” was a key step to freeing innocent people from prison, and
an LLM allowed HRDAG – a tiny, cash-strapped, excellent nonprofit – to
make a giant leap forward in a vital project. I’m a donor to HRDAG and
you should donate to them too: https://hrdag.networkforgood.com/ Good
data-analysis is key to addressing many of our thorniest, most pressing
problems. As Ben Goldacre recounts in his inaugural Oxford lecture, it
is both possible and desirable to build ethical, privacy-preserving
systems for analyzing the most sensitive personal data (NHS patient
records) that yield scores of solid, ground-breaking medical and
scientific insights: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-eaV8SWdjQ The
difference between this kind of work – HRDAG’s exoneration work and
Goldacre’s medical research – and the approach that OpenAI and its
competitors take boils down to how they treat humans. The former treats
all humans as worthy of respect and consideration. The latter treats
humans as instruments – for profit in the short term, and for creating a
hypothetical superintelligence in the (very) long term. As Terry
Pratchett’s Granny Weatherwax reminds us, this is the root of all sin:
“sin is when you treat people like things”:
https://brer-powerofbabel.blogspot.com/2009/02/granny-weatherwax-on-sin-favorite.html
So much of the criticism of AI misses this distinction – instead, this
criticism starts by accepting the self-serving marketing claim of the
“AI safety” crowd – that their software is on the verge of becoming
self-aware, and is thus valuable, a good investment, and a good product
to purchase. This is Lee Vinsel’s “Criti-Hype”: “taking press releases
from startups and covering them with hellscapes”:
https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5
Criti-hype and AI were made for each other. Emily M Bender is a tireless
cataloger of criti-hypeists, like the newspaper reporters who
breathlessly repeat ” completely unsubstantiated claims
(marketing)…sourced to Altman”: https://dair-community.social/<span
class="citation"
data-cites="emilymbender/111464030855880383">@emilymbender/111464030855880383</span>
Bender, like White, is at pains to point out that the real debate isn’t
doomers vs accelerationists. That’s just “billionaires throwing money at
the hope of bringing about the speculative fiction stories they grew up
reading – and philosophers and others feeling important by dressing
these same silly ideas up in fancy words”:
https://dair-community.social/<span class="citation"
data-cites="emilymbender/111464024432217299">@emilymbender/111464024432217299</span>
All of this is just a distraction from real and important scientific
questions about how (and whether) to make automation tools that steer
clear of Granny Weatherwax’s sin of “treating people like things.”
Bender – a computational linguist – isn’t a reactionary who hates
automation for its own sake. On Mystery AI Hype Theater 3000 – the
excellent podcast she co-hosts with Alex Hanna – there is a
machine-generated transcript: https://www.buzzsprout.com/2126417 There
is a serious, meaty debate to be had about the costs and possibilities
of different forms of automation. But the superintelligence
true-believers and their criti-hyping critics keep dragging us away from
these important questions and into fanciful and pointless discussions of
whether and how to appease the godlike computers we will create when we
disassemble the solar system and turn it into computronium. The question
of machine intelligence isn’t intrinsically unserious. As a materialist,
I believe that whatever makes me “me” is the result of the physics and
chemistry of processes inside and around my body. My disbelief in the
existence of a soul means that I’m prepared to think that it might be
possible for something made by humans to replicate something like
whatever process makes me “me.” Ironically, the AI doomers and
accelerationists claim that they, too, are materialists – and that’s why
they’re so consumed with the idea of machine superintelligence. But it’s
precisely because I’m a materialist that I understand these
hypotheticals about self-aware software are less important and less
urgent than the material lives of people today. It’s because I’m a
materialist that my primary concerns about AI are things like the
climate impact of AI data-centers and the human impact of biased,
opaque, incompetent and unfit algorithmic systems – not science
fiction-inspired, self-induced panics over the human race being enslaved
by our robot overlords. (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look

<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
The United Nations’ annual climate summit, COP28, will kick off in Dubai
later this week. Government and private-sector leaders will convene to
outline steps to curb emissions and limit the impacts of global warming.
What are some of the things we’ll be looking for? But first, we’ll
unpack Black Friday sales and give a preview of Cyber Monday spending.
Also: more problems in China’s rocky financial sector.

surveillance</a>:

<blockquote>
<p>
According to the letter, a surveillance program now known as Data
Analytical Services (DAS) has for more than a decade allowed federal,
state, and local law enforcement agencies to mine the details of
Americans’ calls, analyzing the phone records of countless people who
are not suspected of any crime, including victims. Using a technique
known as chain analysis, the program targets not only those in direct
phone contact with a criminal suspect but anyone with whom those
individuals have been in contact as well…

<strong>Why: </strong>“Fundación Proyecto Tití works to stop
deforestation and protect the cotton-top tamarin monkey. Also known as
the tití, these one-pound primates are only found in the forests of
Colombia, but deforestation is destroying their already diminished
habitat. Only about 7,000 titís remain in the wild. The organization is
effective in part because it works so well with the local community to
protect endangered forests and replant degraded lands. The group has a
U.S. sponsor, so all gifts are tax-deductible.
</p>

“The Billion Oyster Project is a growing New York-based conservation
organization working alongside the Harbor School on Governor’s Island to
clean up the New York estuary, once home to the largest number of
oysters in the world. The Billion Oyster project not only grows oysters,
[it] also helps everyone better understand the connection between clean
water, biodiversity, and the food we eat. If Billon Oyster is successful
— and they are well on the way — in the near future, all New Yorkers
will have cleaner rivers and more wildlife thriving throughout the
area.”

the best-positioned to advance electrification thoughtfully and
equitably. This giving season, find an organization working to increase
resiliency and improve the quality of life for their community by
weatherizing low-income homes, providing financial assistance to install
heat pumps, or advocating for local government action to help strengthen
building codes and gain access to solar or EV charging.”

<p>Jon Miltimore (Hacker News): “Marketed to Congress as a benign tool
to help prevent drunk driving, the measure will mandate that automobile
manufacturers build into every car what amounts to a ‘vehicle kill
switch,’” wrote Barr, who was the Libertarian Party’s nominee for
president in 2008.[…]To my relief, I saw several fact-checkers at legacy

tiny Windows 11 OS gets a big update: Tiny11 2311 shrinks 20% and allows
cumulative updates</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>NTDEV, the developer behind Tiny11, has released a new update for its
miniature Windows 11 operating system, called Tiny11 2311, that adds
Microsoft’s latest feature update, 23H2, into the OS and introduces a
plethora of bug fixes addressing issues in the outgoing version of
Tiny11. On top of this, the new update also shrinks Tiny11’s install
size by a whopping 20%, making Tiny11’s renowned footprint even smaller.
There is absolutely no need for Windows 11 to be as big and invasive as
it is, and it feels like such a shame and missed opportunity to burden
an otherwise good and capable operating system with such cruft and
useless junk.</p>

Seizes Attackers Who Held Israel-linked Tanker</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Armed assailants seized and later let go a tanker linked to Israel
off the coast of Yemen on Sunday before being apprehended by the United
States Navy, officials said.</p>
<p>Two ballistic missiles fired from Houthi-controlled Yemen then landed
near a U.S. warship in the Gulf of Aden, raising the stakes amid a
series of ship attacks linked to the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>Yemen’s internationally recognized government blamed the
Iranian-backed Houthi rebels for the attack, though the rebels in
control of the capital, Sanaa, did not acknowledge either the seizure or
the missile attack. </p>
<p>The attackers seized the Liberian-flagged Central Park, managed by
Zodiac Maritime, in the Gulf of Aden, the company, the U.S. and British
militaries and private intelligence firm Ambrey said. </p>
<p>Early Monday morning, Zodiac said the vessel carrying phosphoric acid
and its crew of 22 sailors from Bulgaria, Georgia, India, the
Philippines, Russia, Turkey and Vietnam were “unharmed.”</p>
<p>“We would like to thank the coalition forces who responded quickly,
protecting assets in the area and upholding international maritime law,”
the company said. </p>
<p>The U.S. military’s Central Command said in a statement early Monday
that its forces, including the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Mason,
responded to the seizure and demanded the armed assailants release the
tanker. </p>
<p>“Subsequently, five armed individuals debarked the ship and attempted
to flee via their small boat,” Central Command said. “The Mason pursued
the attackers resulting in their eventual surrender.”</p>
<p>The Central Command did not identify the men, but said a missile
launch from Houthi-controlled Yemen followed early Monday morning.</p>
<p>“The missiles landed in the Gulf of Aden approximately ten nautical
miles from the ships,” the statement said. “The USS Mason … was
concluding its response to the M/V Central Park distress call at the
time of the missile launches. There was no damage or reported injuries
from either vessel during this incident.”</p>
<p>Zodiac described the vessel as being owned by Clumvez Shipping Inc.,
though other records directly linked Zodiac as the owner. London-based
Zodiac Maritime is part of Israeli billionaire Eyal Ofer’s Zodiac Group.
British corporate records listed two men with the last name Ofer as a
current and former director of Clumvez Shipping, including Daniel Guy
Ofer, who is also a director at Zodiac Maritime. </p>
<p>Yemen’s internationally recognized government, which is based out of
nearby Aden, blamed the rebels for the seizure in a statement carried by
their state-run news agency.</p>
<p>“The Yemeni government has renewed its denunciation of the acts of
maritime piracy carried out by the terrorist Houthi militias with the
support of the Iranian regime, the most recent of which was the
hijacking of the Central Park,” the statement read. </p>
<p>The attack happened in a part of the Gulf of Aden that is in theory
under the control of that government’s forces and is fairly distant from
Houthi-controlled territory in the country. Somali pirates are not known
to operate in that area.</p>
<p>Zodiac Maritime has been targeted previously amid a wider yearslong
shadow war between Iran and Israel. In 2021, a drone attack assessed by
the U.S. and other Western nations to have been carried out by Iran
killed two crew members aboard Zodiac’s oil tanker Mercer Street off the
coast of Oman. </p>
<p>The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations,
which provides warnings to sailors in the Middle East, had earlier
issued a warning to sailors that “two black-and-white craft carrying
eight persons in military-style clothing” had been seen in the
area. </p>
<p>The UKMTO put the Central Park’s location over 60 kilometers south of
Yemen’s coast, some 80 kilometers east of Djibouti and around 110
kilometers northeast of Somalia in the Gulf of Aden, a key shipping
route. </p>
<p>The Central Park seizure comes after a container ship, CMA CGM Symi,
owned by another Israeli billionaire, came under attack Friday by a
suspected Iranian drone in the Indian Ocean. Iran has not acknowledged
carrying out the attack, nor did it respond to questions from the AP
about that assault. </p>
<p>Both the Symi and the Central Park had been behaving as if they faced
a threat in recent days.</p>
<p>The ships had switched off their Automatic Identification System
trackers, according to data from MarineTraffic.com analyzed by the AP.
Ships are supposed to keep their AIS active for safety reasons, but
crews will turn them off if it appears they might be targeted. In the
Central Park’s case, the vessel had last transmitted four days ago after
it left the Suez Canal heading south into the Red Sea. </p>
<p>Global shipping had increasingly been targeted as the Israel-Hamas
war threatens to become a wider regional conflict — even as a truce has
halted fighting and Hamas exchanges hostages for Palestinian prisoners
held by Israel. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Houthis seized a vehicle transport ship also
linked to Israel in the Red Sea off Yemen. </p>
<p>Meanwhile on Sunday, the American aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower
traveled through the Strait of Hormuz and entered the Persian Gulf, the
U.S. military said. The Eisenhower was accompanied by the guided-missile
cruiser USS Philippine Sea, the guided-missile destroyers USS Gravely
and the USS Stethem and the French frigate Languedoc.</p>
