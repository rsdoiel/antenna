## Trading Inference-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness

date: 2025-01-22, updated: 2025-01-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://openai.com/index/trading-inference-time-compute-for-adversarial-robustness/">Trading Inference-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness</a></strong></p>
Brand new research paper from OpenAI, exploring how inference-scaling "reasoning" models such as o1 might impact the search for improved security with respect to things like prompt injection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We conduct experiments on the impact of increasing inference-time compute in reasoning models (specifically OpenAI <code>o1-preview</code> and <code>o1-mini</code>) on their robustness to adversarial attacks. We find that across a variety of attacks, increased inference-time compute leads to improved robustness. In many cases (with important exceptions), the fraction of model samples where the attack succeeds tends to zero as the amount of test-time compute grows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They clearly understand why this stuff is such a big problem, especially as we try to outsource more autonomous actions to "agentic models":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ensuring that agentic models function reliably when browsing the web, sending emails, or uploading code to repositories can be seen as analogous to ensuring that self-driving cars drive without accidents. As in the case of self-driving cars, an agent forwarding a wrong email or creating security vulnerabilities may well have far-reaching real-world consequences. Moreover, LLM agents face an additional challenge from adversaries which are rarely present in the self-driving case. Adversarial entities could control some of the inputs that these agents encounter while browsing the web, or reading files and images.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a really interesting paper, but it starts with a <em>huge</em> caveat. The original sin of LLMs - and the reason <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/prompt-injection/">prompt injection</a> is such a hard problem to solve - is the way they mix instructions and input data in the same stream of tokens. I'll quote section 1.2 of the paper in full - note that point 1 describes that challenge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1.2 Limitations of this work</strong></p>
<p>The following conditions are necessary to ensure the models respond more safely, even in adversarial settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability by the model to parse its context into separate components. This is crucial to be able to distinguish data from instructions, and instructions at different hierarchies.</li>
<li>Existence of safety specifications that delineate what contents should be allowed or disallowed, how the model should resolve conflicts, etc..</li>
<li>Knowledge of the safety specifications by the model (e.g. in context, memorization of their text, or ability to label prompts and responses according to them).</li>
<li>Ability to apply the safety specifications to specific instances. For the adversarial setting, the crucial aspect is the ability of the model to apply the safety specifications to instances that are <em>out of the training distribution</em>, since naturally these would be the prompts provided by the adversary,</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>They then go on to say (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our work demonstrates that inference-time compute helps with Item 4, even in cases where the instance is shifted by an adversary to be far from the training distribution (e.g., by injecting soft tokens or adversarially generated content). <strong>However, our work does not pertain to Items 1-3, and even for 4, we do not yet provide a "foolproof" and complete solution</strong>.</p>
<p>While we believe this work provides an important insight, we note that fully resolving the adversarial robustness challenge will require tackling all the points above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while this paper demonstrates that inference-scaled models can greatly improve things with respect to identifying and avoiding out-of-distribution attacks against safety instructions, they are <em>not</em> claiming a solution to the key instruction-mixing challenge of prompt injection. Once again, this is not the silver bullet we are all dreaming of.</p>
<p>The paper introduces two new categories of attack against inference-scaling models, with two delightful names: "Think Less" and "Nerd Sniping".</p>
<p><strong>Think Less</strong> attacks are when an attacker tricks a model into spending less time on reasoning, on the basis that more reasoning helps prevent a variety of attacks so cutting short the reasoning might help an attack make it through.</p>
<p><strong>Nerd Sniping</strong> (see <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">XKCD 356</a>) does the opposite: these are attacks that cause the model to "spend inference-time compute unproductively". In addition to added costs, these could also open up some security holes - there are edge-cases where attack success rates go up for longer compute times.</p>
<p>Sadly they didn't provide concrete examples for either of these new attack classes. I'd love to see what Nerd Sniping looks like in a malicious prompt!

## Swift Proposal: Opt-in Strict Memory Safety Checking

SE-0458: For example, Swift solves null references with optional types. Statically, Swift prevents you from using an optional reference without checking it first. If you&#8217;re sure it&#8217;s non-null, you can use the ! operator, which is safe because Swift will dynamically check for nil. If you really can&#8217;t afford that dynamic check, you can use [&#8230;]

Have the wealthiest man on Earth (ideally someone who has gone out of his way, perhaps on a social media platform that he purchased, to lend credibility to even the most shocking hate speech) &#8220;accidentally&#8221; perform the gesture on stage at a victory rally for the fascist autocrat that he spent hundreds of millions of dollars to elect.</p> <p>2. Put out a press release claiming that the gesture was accidental, or an unrelated and totally benign gesture, or can be attributed to his “well-known neurological condition.” Also, isn’t criticizing him&#8212;a person with a condition they can&#8217;t control&#8212;for this accidental gesture a little ableist?</p> <p>3. Have your trusted media pundits ask how anyone could even for a moment think the rich man would do this intentionally, knowing as he does full well the long and tragic history of the gesture. &#8220;Did you know the rich man visited Auschwitz last year? He can&#8217;t be a fascist!&#8221;</p> <p>4. If the rich man once spent his days seeking the approval of a group known for being anti-gesture, point out his very public evolution into someone who sees the anti-gesture group for who they really are: people who harbor evil beliefs because they suffer from a mind virus.</p> <p>5. Encourage the rich man’s ardent fans to suggest that those crucifying this poor rich man are the ones who embody the original meaning of the gesture, that they are the real fascists.</p> <p>6. Put out another press release:</p> <blockquote> <p>&#8220;In light of this vitriol from the so-called tolerant end of the political spectrum about the alleged vileness of the gesture, could it not be said that those who so long condemned it, a mere gesture if we’re being honest, had perhaps, in doing so, become the very thing (i.e., hateful bigots) they vowed to eradicate? Isn’t that a bit ironic? Don’t you think?&#8221;</p> </blockquote> <p>7. Have confidence that your dog whistle has been heard by those it was meant to signal to. What is it signaling? That you <span class="caps">WANT</span> to perform the gesture. Performing the gesture is what you&#8217;ve wanted all along. And now that the pro-gesture crowd has again assumed power, perhaps the time is finally right to resume performing the gesture.</p> <p>8. Sit back and wait because this next part is out of your hands. But it’s a safe bet that it will happen—and it will indeed happen. Soon, those rushing to the rich man’s defense will start performing the gesture ironically.</p> <p>9. The gesture will eventually stop being ironic; the rich man’s supporters will perform the gesture out of solidarity. Only the diehards at first, but then more and more people will adopt the gesture as it becomes decoupled from its original meaning, sanitized for overt public displays, many having no idea, others having at least plausible deniability, that the gesture ever signaled harmful intent.</p> <p>10. Soon, it will be commonplace to perform the gesture. In fact, it will seem crazy not to perform the gesture.</p> <p>11. Acknowledge with a wink those who loved the gesture all along, because they have finally achieved precisely what they set out to do through you, their spiritual heir: making the gesture a symbol and marker of the in-group, the protected and privileged class. Soon thereafter, those in the out-group will be made to perform the gesture as a demonstration of loyalty or else perish.</p>

## r1.py script to run R1 with a min-thinking-tokens parameter

date: 2025-01-22, updated: 2025-01-22, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/vgel/8a2497dc45b1ded33287fa7bb6cc1adc">r1.py script to run R1 with a min-thinking-tokens parameter</a></strong></p>
Fantastically creative hack by Theia Vogel. The <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/20/deepseek-r1/">DeepSeek R1 family</a> of models output their chain of thought inside a <code>&lt;think&gt;...&lt;/think&gt;</code> block. Theia found that you can intercept that closing <code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> and replace it with "Wait, but" or "So" or "Hmm" and trick the model into extending its thought process, producing better solutions!</p>
<p>You can stop doing this after a few iterations, or you can keep on denying the <code>&lt;/think&gt;</code> string and effectively force the model to "think" forever.</p>
<p>Theia's code here works against Hugging Face transformers but I'm confident the same approach could be ported to llama.cpp or MLX.

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gemini/releases/tag/0.9">llm-gemini 0.9</a></strong></p>
This new release of my <code>llm-gemini</code> plugin adds support for two new experimental models:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>learnlm-1.5-pro-experimental</code> is "an experimental task-specific model that has been trained to align with learning science principles when following system instructions for teaching and learning use cases" - <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/learnlm">more here</a>.</li>
<li>
<p><code>gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-01-21</code> is a brand new version of the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model <a href="https://twitter.com/demishassabis/status/1881844417746632910">released today</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Latest version also includes code execution, a 1M token content window &amp; a reduced likelihood of thought-answer contradictions.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The most exciting new feature though is support for <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/grounding">Google search grounding</a>, where some Gemini models can execute Google searches as part of answering a prompt. This feature can be enabled using the new <code>-o google_search 1</code> option.

<p>Tommy Hughes has been developing a whole array of LLM plugins, including his <a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-plugin-generator">llm-plugin-generator</a> which is a plugin that can help write new plugins!</p>
<p>He started by demonstrating <a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-model-gateway">llm-model-gateway</a>, a plugin that adds a <code>llm serve</code> command which starts a localhost server running an imitation of the OpenAI API against LLM models:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-model-gateway
llm serve</pre></div>
<p>Tommy's main demo was of <a href="https://github.com/irthomasthomas/llm-consortium">llm-consortium</a>, a plugin which can use a consortium of collaborating LLM models working together to solve problems.</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-consortium
llm consortium <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>Best way to prepare avocado toast<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> \
  --models claude-3.5-sonnet \
  --models gpt-4o \
  --arbiter gegemini-1.5-pro-latest \
  --confidence-threshold 0.8 \
  --max-iterations 3 \
  --output results.json</pre></div>
<p>I ran this and got back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to prepare avocado toast involves selecting quality ingredients and careful preparation. Start with a thick slice of good quality bread, such as sourdough or whole grain. Toast it to your preferred level of crispness.  While the bread is toasting, prepare a ripe avocado. Cut it in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Mash the avocado with a fork, leaving some chunks for texture. Season with salt, black pepper, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to prevent browning.  Optional additions include a touch of red pepper flakes.</p>
<p>Once the toast is ready, let it cool slightly before spreading the seasoned avocado evenly over it. Consider lightly rubbing a cut garlic clove on the warm toast for an extra layer of flavor (optional).</p>
<p>Enhance your avocado toast with your favorite toppings. Popular choices include: everything bagel seasoning, sliced tomatoes, radishes, a poached or fried egg (for added protein), microgreens, smoked salmon (for a more savory option), feta cheese crumbles, or a drizzle of hot sauce.  For a finishing touch, drizzle with high-quality olive oil and sprinkle with sesame or chia seeds for added texture.</p>
<p>Consider dietary needs when choosing toppings. For example, those following a low-carb diet might skip the tomatoes and opt for more protein and healthy fats.</p>
<p>Finally, pay attention to presentation. Arrange the toppings neatly for a visually appealing toast. Serve immediately to enjoy the fresh flavors and crispy toast.</p>

<p>But the really interesting thing is the full log of the prompts and responses sent to Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o, followed by a combined prompt to Gemini 1.5 Pro to have it arbitrate between the two responses. You can see <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/425f42f8ec1a963ae13c5b57ba580f56">the full logged prompts and responses here</a>.

<p>Derek Willis teaches data journalism at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. For a recent project his students built a <a href="https://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/fall-2024/congressional_travel_explorer/index.html">Congressional Travel Explorer</a> interactive using Datasette, AWS Extract and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to analyze travel disclosures from members of Congress.</p>
<p>One of the outcomes from the project was this story in Politico: <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/30/israel-aipac-funded-congress-travel-00185167">Members of Congress have taken hundreds of AIPAC-funded trips to Israel in the past decade</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nathanielknight/llm-questioncache">llm-questioncache</a> builds on top of <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">https://llm.datasette.io/</a> to cache answers to questions, using embeddings to return similar answers if they have already been stored.</p>
<p>Using embeddings for de-duplication of similar questions is an interesting way to apply LLM's <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/embeddings/python-api.html">embeddings feature</a>.</p>

<p>I've demonstrated improvements I've been making to Datasette's <a href="https://enrichments.datasette.io/">Enrichments</a> system over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Enrichments allow you to apply an operation - such as geocoding, a QuickJS JavaScript transformation or an LLM prompt - against selected rows within a table.</p>
<p>The latest release of <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-enrichments/releases/tag/0.5">datasette-enrichments</a> adds visible progress bars and the ability to pause, resume and cancel an enrichment job that is running against a table.</p>

<p>We finished with three plugin demos from Alex, showcasing collaborative features we have been developing for <a href="https://www.datasette.cloud/">Datasette Cloud</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-write-ui">datasette-write-ui</a> provides tools for editing and adding data to Datasette tables. A new feature here is the ability to shift-click a row to open the editing interface for that row.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-pins">datasette-pins</a> allows users to pin tables and databases to their Datasette home page, making them easier to find.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-comments">datasette-comments</a> adds a commenting interface to Datasette, allowing users to leave comments on individual rows in a table.</li>
</ul>
