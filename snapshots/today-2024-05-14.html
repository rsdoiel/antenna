id="google-is-experimenting-with-running-chrome-os-on-android">Google is
experimenting with running Chrome OS on Android</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Now that Android – since version 13 – ships with the Android
Virtualisation Framework, Google can start doing interesting things with
it. It turns out the first interesting thing Google wants do with it is
run Chrome OS inside of it. Even though AVF was initially designed
around running small workloads in a highly stripped-down build of
Android loaded in an isolated virtual machine, there’s technically no
reason it can’t be used to run other operating systems. As a matter of
fact, this was demonstrated already when developer Danny Lin got Windows
11 running on an Android phone back in 2022. Google itself never
officially provided support for running anything other than its custom
build of Android called “microdroid” in AVF, but that’s no longer the
case. The company has started to offer official support for running
Chromium OS, the open-source version of Chrome OS, on Android phones
through AVF, and it has even been privately demoing this to other
companies. At a privately held event, Google recently demonstrated a
special build of Chromium OS — code-named “ferrochrome” — running in a
virtual machine on a Pixel 8. However, Chromium OS wasn’t shown running
on the phone’s screen itself. Rather, it was projected to an external
display, which is possible because Google recently enabled display
output on its Pixel 8 series. Time will tell if Google is thinking of
positioning Chrome OS as a platform for its desktop mode ambitions and
Samsung DeX rival. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority It seems that
Google is in the phase of exploring if there are any OEMs interested in
allowing users to plug their Android phone into an external display and
input devices and run Chrome OS on it. This sounds like an interesting
approach to the longstanding dream of convergence – one device for all
your computing needs – but at the same time, it feels quite convoluted
to have your Android device emulate an entire Chrome OS installation.
What a damning condemnation of Android as a platform that despite years
of trying, Google just can’t seem to make Android and its applications
work in a desktop form factor. I’ve tried to shoehorn Android into a
desktop workflow, and it’s quite hard, despite third parties having made
some interesting tools to help you along. It really seems Android just
does not want to be anywhere else but on a mobile touch display.</p>

hacked to run Windows 11 on Arm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>As Nintendo Switch unlocks and homebrew software develops, people are
inclined to explore the possibilities and whether or not they actually
provide a good experience. Our new prime example seems to be a full
install of Windows 11 Arm on the Switch. As noted by <span
class="citation" data-cites="PatRyk">@PatRyk</span> on Twitter, who
actually set this up, the experience is pretty grueling! The initial
installation took three hours, and even basic system tasks were
unresponsive. ↫ Christopher Harper at Tom’s Hardware Silly, sure, but
efforts like these all contribute to emulation efforts, which will
eventually be important once Nintendo drops support for this machine and
they become increasingly harder to get. Give it a decade or so and we’ll
need the Switch emulators to keep playing Switch games.</p>

id="biden-sharply-hikes-us-tariffs-on-billions-in-chinese-chips-cars">Biden
sharply hikes US tariffs on billions in Chinese chips, cars</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled a bundle of
steep tariff increases on an array of Chinese imports including electric
vehicles, computer chips and medical products, risking an election-year
standoff with Beijing in a bid to woo voters who give his economic
policies low marks.</p>
<p>Biden will keep tariffs put in place by his Republican predecessor
Donald Trump while ratcheting up others, including a quadrupling of EV
duties to over 100%, the White House said in a statement. It cited
“unacceptable risks” to U.S. economic security posed by what it
considers unfair Chinese practices that are flooding global markets with
cheap goods.</p>
<p>The new measures impact $18 billion in Chinese imported goods
including steel and aluminum, semiconductors, batteries, critical
minerals, solar cells and cranes, the White House said. The announcement
confirmed earlier Reuters reporting.</p>
<p>The United States imported $427 billion in goods from China in 2023
and exported $148 billion to the world’s No. 2 economy, according to the
U.S. Census Bureau, a trade gap that has persisted for decades and
become an ever more sensitive subject in Washington.</p>
<p>“China’s using the same playbook it has before to power its own
growth at the expense of others by continuing to invest, despite excess
Chinese capacity and flooding global markets with exports that are
underpriced due to unfair practices,” White House National Economic
Adviser Lael Brainard told reporters on a conference call.</p>
<p>U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the revised tariffs were
justified because China was continuing to steal U.S. intellectual
property and in some cases had become “more aggressive” in cyber
intrusions targeting American technology.</p>
<p>She said prior “Section 301” tariffs had minimal impact on U.S.
economy-wide prices and employment, but had been effective in reducing
U.S. imports of Chinese goods, while increasing imports from other
countries.</p>
<p>But Tai recommended tariff exclusions for dozens of industrial
machinery import categories from China, including 19 for solar product
manufacturing equipment.</p>
<p>Even as Biden’s steps fell in line with Trump’s premise that tougher
trade measures are warranted, the Democrat took aim at his opponent in
November’s election.</p>
<p>The White House said Trump’s 2020 trade deal with China did not
increase American exports or boost American manufacturing jobs, and it
said the 10% across-the-board tariffs on goods from all points of origin
that Trump has proposed would frustrate U.S. allies and raise prices.
Trump has floated tariffs of 60% or higher on all Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Administration officials said their measures are “carefully
targeted,” combined with domestic investment, plotted with close allies
and unlikely to worsen a bout of inflation that has already angered U.S.
voters and imperiled Biden’s re-election bid. They also downplayed the
risk of retaliation from Beijing.</p>
<p>Biden has struggled to convince voters of the efficacy of his
economic policies despite a backdrop of low unemployment and above-trend
economic growth. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month showed Trump had a 7
percentage-point edge over Biden on the economy.</p>
<p>Analysts have warned that a trade tiff could raise costs for EVs
overall, hurting Biden’s climate goals and his aim to create
manufacturing jobs.</p>
<p>Biden has said he wants to win this era of competition with China but
not to launch a trade war that could hurt the mutually dependent
economies. He has worked in recent months to ease tensions in one-on-one
talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Both 2024 U.S. presidential candidates have sharply departed from the
free-trade consensus that once reigned in Washington, a period capped by
China’s joining the World Trade Organization in 2001.</p>
<p>China has said the tariffs are counterproductive and risk inflaming
tensions. Trump’s broader imposition of tariffs during his 2017-2021
presidency kicked off a tariff war with China.</p>
<p>As part of the long-awaited tariff update, Biden will increase
tariffs this year under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 from 25% to
100% on EVs, bringing total duties to 102.5%, from 7.5% to 25% on
lithium-ion EV batteries and other battery parts and from 25% to 50% on
photovoltaic cells used to make solar panels. “Certain” critical
minerals will have their tariffs raised from nothing to 25%.</p>
<p>The tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes will rise to 25% from zero, those
on syringes and needles will rise to 50% from nothing now and some
personal protective equipment (PPE) used in medical facilities will rise
to 25% from as little as 0% now. Shortages in PPE made largely in China
hampered the United States’ COVID-19 response.</p>
<p>More tariffs will follow in 2025 and 2026 on semiconductors, whose
tariff rate will double to 50%, as well as lithium-ion batteries that
are not used in elective vehicles, graphite and permanent magnets as
well as rubber medical and surgical gloves.</p>
<p>A step Biden previously announced to raise tariffs on some steel and
aluminum products will take effect this year, the White House said.
 </p>
<p>A number of lawmakers have called for massive hikes on Chinese
vehicle tariffs. There are relatively few Chinese-made light-duty
vehicles being imported now. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod
Brown wants the Biden administration to ban Chinese EVs outright, over
concerns they pose risks to Americans’ personal data.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who warned China in April that
its excess production of EVs and solar products was unacceptable, said
that such concerns were widely shared by U.S. allies and the actions
were “motivated not by anti-China policy but by a desire to prevent
damaging economic dislocation from unfair economic practices.”</p>

the new rule will require regional transmission organizations adopt the
long view, extending their planning horizon over a 20-year period and
calling for updates every five years. FERC is also requiring regional
transmission planners to consult a specific set of economic and
reliability benefits like reducing congestion on the grid and resilience
against extreme weather and lower costs when selecting projects. And
transmission planners will have to come up with a default method for
allocating costs associated with new projects.

people can bend the emissions curve, survive the climate crisis, and
bounce forward to a safer, healthier, more equitable, and sustainable

The event will culminate in a protocol “fashioned along the lines of the
Montreal Protocol” that will “provide the guidelines for making everyone
climate resilient.” The protocol will then be submitted to the UNFCCC.

At Rochester Regional Health in New York, aggressive collection
activities on medical debts are barred. Patients are not sued, their
wages are not garnished, and unpaid bills won’t sink their credit
scores. We’ll hear about the health system’s shift to the uncommon model
and learn more about its impact. But first, the Biden administration is
announcing increased tariffs on imports from China. And later, how can
the WNBA sustain its surging popularity?

organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from overseas

road for the country: Does its future lie with Europe or Russia? Then,
rapid growth in the Indian tech hub of Bengaluru has put pressure on

<h2 id="ea-is-prototyping-in-game-ads-even-as-we-speak">EA is
prototyping in-game ads even as we speak</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has a long, storied history of trying to wring more
money out of gamers after they’ve purchased a game — now, it appears,
the company’s hard at work on its next generation of in-game ads. EA CEO
Andrew Wilson admitted as much on the company’s Q4 earnings call: when
an analyst asked about “the market opportunity for more dynamic ad
insertion across more traditional AAA games,” he said the company’s
already working on it. “We have teams internally in the company right
now looking at how do we do very thoughtful implementations inside of
our game experiences,” said Wilson. ↫ Sean Hollister at The Verge Ads in
games are definitely not new – we’ve seen countless games built entirely
around brands, like Tapper for Budweiser, Pepsiman, or Cool Spot for
7-Up – and banner ads and product placement in various games has been a
thing for decades, too. It seems like EA wants to take this several
steps further and use things like dynamic ad insertion in games, so that
when you’re playing some racing game, you’ll get an ad for your local
Hyundai dealer, or an ad for a gun store when you’re playing GTA in the
US. Either way, it’s going to make games worse, which is perfectly in
line with EA’s mission.</p>

id="archegos-founder-goes-on-trial-for-fraud-market-manipulation">Archegos
founder goes on trial for fraud, market manipulation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The trial of Archegos founder Bill Hwang for alleged
securities fraud and market manipulation opened in New York on Monday,
and focused on the fund’s spectacular 2021 implosion that cost large
banks billions of dollars.</p>
<p>The family-owned hedge fund run by Hwang had taken huge bets on a few
stocks with money borrowed from banks, and when several of those bets
turned sour, the fund was unable to meet “margin calls” to cover the
losses.</p>
<p>The 2021 collapse of the fund sent shock waves through financial
markets and caused $10 billion in losses for Credit Suisse, Nomura,
Morgan Stanley and other leading financial institutions.</p>
<p>Hwang and Patrick Halligan, chief financial officer of Archegos, were
both arrested by the FBI in April 2022.</p>
<p>“Their alleged crimes jeopardized not only their own company but also
innocent investors and financial institutions around the world,” Deputy
Attorney General Lisa Monaco told reporters at the time.</p>
<p>The two men, who deny the charges, went on trial in Manhattan federal
court.</p>
<p>“Bill Hwang was a billionaire, and yet he risked nearly everything
because he wanted more: more money, more success, more power,”
prosecutor Alexandra Rothman told the jury.</p>
<p>Archegos was a “house of cards built on manipulation and lies,” she
was quoted as saying by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>‘Deceptive conduct’ </p>
<p>Hwang and Halligan used the firm “as an instrument of market
manipulation and fraud, with far-reaching consequences for other
participants in the United States securities markets,” according to the
indictment. </p>
<p>Hwang and other conspirators, including head trader William Tomita,
sought to defraud investors by convincing them that shares in the fund’s
portfolio were on the rise when in fact the stock price increases “were
the artificial product of Hwang’s manipulative trading and deceptive
conduct that caused others to trade,” the indictment said.</p>
<p>They also repeatedly made “false and misleading statements” to
convince others to trade with and extend credit to the firm, it
said.</p>
<p>The fund used derivatives to take large stakes in top Chinese
companies such as Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop
Holdings, plus U.S. giants such as ViacomCBS and Discovery.</p>
<p>The plan initially worked, and the fund tripled in size in just a
year, while Hwang’s personal fortune soared to $35 billion from $1.5
billion, turning him and the firm into “significant economic forces in
the United States securities markets,” the filing said.</p>
<p>The move to inflate share prices caused the firm to expand rapidly,
“increasing in value from approximately $1.5 billion with $10 billion in
exposure in March 2020 to a value of more than $36 billion with $160
billion in exposure at its peak in March 2021,” said the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, the market regulator.</p>
<p>Hwang studied in the United States and went to work for Tiger
Management, rising to form his own Tiger Asia Management. In 2012, Hwang
paid $44 million to settle with the SEC over an insider trading case and
shuttered the firm.</p>

id="pakistan-us-discuss-how-to-counter-afghan-based-is-and-ttp-terrorists">Pakistan,
US discuss how to counter Afghan-based IS and TTP terrorists</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>islamabad — The United States and Pakistan have concluded their
latest round of counterterrorism talks, agreeing to intensify their
collaboration in the fight against terrorist organizations like the
Pakistani Taliban and a regional Islamic State affiliate.</p>
<p>Washington and Islamabad issued a joint statement simultaneously on
Monday, saying the May 10 bilateral dialogue hosted by the U.S. was
centered on tackling “the most pressing challenges to regional and
global security.”</p>
<p>The meeting came amid a recent surge in terrorism in Pakistan,
resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people, including security
forces. The violence is mostly claimed by Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan
(TTP), known as the Pakistani Taliban, who are believed to operate from
sanctuaries in neighboring Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“Pakistan and the United States recognize that a partnership to
counter ISIS-Khorasan, TTP, and other terrorist organizations will
advance security in the region and serve as a model of bilateral and
regional cooperation to address transnational terrorism threats,” the
statement read.</p>
<p>The statement used an acronym for an Afghanistan-based Islamic State
affiliate known as IS-Khorasan, which routinely carries out terrorist
attacks in the country and beyond its borders.</p>
<p>Pakistani and U.S. officials at Friday’s talks in Washington resolved
to step up communication and continue collaboration “to detect and deter
violent extremism through whole-of-government approaches.”</p>
<p>According to the statement, the two sides stressed the importance of
capacity building, including sharing technical expertise and best
practices, providing investigative and prosecutorial assistance and
enhancing border security infrastructure and training.</p>
<p>Islamabad maintains that TTP-led terrorist attacks on Pakistani soil
have intensified since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in August
2021 following the withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO forces after a 20-year
counterterrorism mission.</p>
<p>Pakistani authorities allege that members of the Afghan Taliban are
facilitating TTP fighters in carrying out cross-border attacks.</p>
<p>The Taliban government in Kabul denies the allegations, saying it is
not allowing anyone to threaten other countries, including Pakistan,
from Afghan soil.</p>
<p>In a new report slated for release on Tuesday, the U.S. Institute of
Peace has warned that Afghanistan “presents growing space for terrorist
groups compared to the period before the U.S. withdrawal.”</p>
<p>USIP published a summary of the study on its website, noting that
ISIS-K poses “a rising threat with reach beyond the immediate region,
greater than during the pre-withdrawal period,” and the TTP “has also
returned as a regional security threat.”</p>
<p>The report also stated that al-Qaida and its South Asia affiliate
“continue to maintain ties with and receive support” from Afghanistan’s
Taliban rulers.</p>

blocks Chinese-backed crypto mining firm from owning land near military
base</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden on Monday issued an order blocking a
Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining firm from owning land near a
Wyoming nuclear missile base. </p>
<p>The order forces the divestment of property operated as a crypto
mining facility near Francis E. Warren Air Force Base. It also forces
the removal of certain equipment owned by MineOne Partners Ltd., a firm
that is partly owned by the Chinese state. </p>
<p>This comes as the U.S. is slated on Tuesday to issue major new
tariffs on electric vehicles, semiconductors, solar equipment and
medical supplies imported from China, according to a U.S. official and
another person familiar with the plan. </p>
<p>The divestment order was made in coordination with the U.S. Committee
on Foreign Investment in the United States — a little-known but
potentially powerful government agency tasked with investigating
corporate deals for national security concerns that holds power to force
the company to change. </p>
<p>A 2018 law granted CFIUS the authority to review real estate
transactions near sensitive sites across the U.S., including F.E. Warren
Air Force Base. </p>
<p>The order was vague about the specific national security concerns,
with the Treasury Department saying only that there were issues with
“specialized and foreign-sourced equipment potentially capable of
facilitating surveillance and espionage activities” that “presented a
significant national security risk.” </p>
<p>According to CFIUS, the purchase was not filed with the body, as
required, until after the panel received a public tip. </p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who serves as the chairperson of
CFIUS, said the role of the committee is “to ensure that foreign
investment does not undermine our national security, particularly as it
relates to transactions that present risk to sensitive U.S. military
installations as well as those involving specialized equipment and
technologies.”</p>

id="dr.-cyril-wecht-celebrity-pathologist-who-argued-more-than-1-shooter-killed-jfk-dies-at-93">Dr. Cyril
Wecht, celebrity pathologist who argued more than 1 shooter killed JFK,
dies at 93</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>pittsburgh — Dr. Cyril Wecht, a pathologist and attorney whose biting
cynicism and controversial positions on high-profile deaths such as
President John F. Kennedy’s 1963 assassination caught the attention of
prosecutors and TV viewers alike, died Monday. He was 93.</p>
<p>Wecht’s death was announced by the Administrative Office of
Pennsylvania Courts, which did not disclose a cause or place of death,
saying only that he “passed away peacefully.”</p>
<p>Wecht’s almost meteoric rise to fame began in 1964, three years after
he reentered civilian life after serving a brief stint at Maxwell Air
Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. At the time, Wecht was serving as an
assistant district attorney in Allegheny County and a pathologist in a
Pittsburgh hospital.</p>
<p>The request came from a group of forensic scientists: Review the
Warren Commission’s report that concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting
alone, assassinated Kennedy. And Wecht, with his usual thoroughness, did
just that — the beginning of what became a lifelong obsession to prove
his theory that there was more than one shooter involved in the
killing.</p>
<p>After reviewing the autopsy documents, discovering the president’s
brain had gone missing, and viewing an amateur video of the
assassination, Wecht concluded the commission’s findings that there was
a single bullet involved in the attack that killed Kennedy and injured
Texas Governor John Connally was “absolute nonsense.”</p>
<p>Wecht’s lecture circuit demonstration detailing his theory that it
was impossible for one bullet to cause the damage it did on that
November day in Dallas made its way into Oliver Stone’s movie “JFK”
after the director consulted with him. It became the famous courtroom
scene showing the path of the “magic bullet.”</p>
<p>Wecht’s outspokenness on the Kennedy assassination, and the publicity
he generated, later made him a go-to pathologist on dozens of other
high-profile cases ranging from Elvis Presley to JonBenet Ramsey, the
child beauty queen whose death remains unsolved.</p>
<p>At the homicide trial of school head Jean Harris, accused of
murdering “Scarsdale Diet” physician Herman Tarnower, Wecht testified
unsuccessfully for the defense. His testimony at the trial of Claus von
Bulow may have helped acquit Von Bulow of charges he tried to kill his
heir wife, Sunny.</p>
<p>After studying Elvis’ autopsy report, Wecht concluded, and shared his
findings on national television, that Presley had likely died of an
overdose, not heart disease. His findings spurred Tennessee officials to
reopen the case in 1994, though, in the end, the official cause of death
remained unchanged.</p>
<p>In the months preceding the O.J. Simpson homicide trial in 1994,
Wecht was a frequent talk show guest, conjecturing on the “Today” show
and “Good Morning America” about the significance of blood samples and
other evidence.</p>
<p>When Michael Jackson died in 2009, Wecht again took to the airwaves,
discussing the deadly mix of drugs and sedatives that killed the King of
Pop.</p>
<p>Wecht detailed many of his cases in six books. In Cause of Death — a
book authored by Wecht, his son Benjamin, and Mark Curriden, formerly a
writer for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The Dallas Morning News
— attorney Alan Dershowitz praised the pathologist as the “Sherlock
Holmes of forensic sciences.”</p>
<p>The son of a grocer, Wecht attended undergraduate school at the

<h2 id="dogs-devotion-are-on-display-at-westminster-show">Dogs, devotion
are on display at Westminster show</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — Less than three years ago, Mary Ann and David Giordano
were taking turns lying on the living room floor with their Afghan
hound, Frankie, hand-feeding the desperately ill dog anything she would
eat. </p>
<p>She had developed severe kidney problems after contracting Lyme
disease, despite being on medications meant to repel the ticks that
carry the bacteria that cause it. Veterinarians weren’t sure she would
survive. </p>
<p>Yet on Monday, Frankie was at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show,
healthy and ready to compete. She would face off against over a dozen
other Afghan hounds — including the winner of last month’s World Dog
Show in Croatia — for a chance to advance to the next round of the
United States’ most prestigious canine event. </p>
<p>“It was really tough,” Mary Ann Giordano said, her voice halting as
she described Frankie’s eight-month ordeal. “But she made it.” </p>
<p>For all the pooch pageantry of Westminster — the coiffed poodles, the
top-knotted toy dogs, the formality of dogs trotting around a ring —
it’s also an illustration of the bond people form with dogs, and what
each will do for the other. </p>
<p>Like setting up an array of box fans and even a portable dehumidifier
to get a puli’s long, thick cords dry after a bath, a process that can
take 24 hours, in Valarie Cheimis’ experience. The cords form naturally,
though owners aid the process by separating them. </p>
<p>Why go through all that? </p>
<p>“These are fun dogs. They’re full of personality,” Cheimis said as
she petted Csoki, one of her pulik (the proper plural), ahead of ring
time. </p>
<p>Sure, the Hungarian herding breed can be stubborn and barky, Cheimis
said, but Csoki also looks after her geese and chickens at home in
Kingfield, Maine, even lying down next to the goslings. </p>
<p>Mister, a bloodhound who won a merit award in his breed Monday, also
puts his breed’s ancient instincts to work. He’s qualified to trail
missing people, though his calls so far have been resolved before they
got into the field, said co-owner, breeder and handler Renee Wagner of
Niagara Falls, New York. </p>
<p>The 148th Westminster show kicked off Saturday with an agility
competition — won by a mixed-breed dog for the first time since
Westminster added the event in 2014. Nimble, the winner, was handled by
Cynthia Hornor, who took the trophy with a border collie last year. </p>
<p>Monday marked the start of the traditional judging that leads to the
best in show prize, to be awarded Tuesday night. Semifinals begin Monday
night, pitting the winners of each breed against others in their
“group,” such as hounds or herding dogs. </p>
<p>The 2,500-plus first-round entrants range from tiny Yorkshire
terriers to towering Great Danes. They include a newly added breed, the
Lancashire heeler, represented Monday by a single contestant named
Mando. </p>
<p>If he knew a lot was riding on his little shoulders, he didn’t show
it as he appeared in the first-round ring and someone in the audience
yelled, “Yay! History!” </p>
<p>“He just has a rock-star attitude,” handler Jessica Plourde said
afterward. </p>
<p>The show also was a first for Alfredo Delgado and Maria Davila, who
had traveled from Juncos, Puerto Rico, with their French bulldog,
Duncan. </p>
<p>Their path started when Delgado’s brother found a lost Frenchie. It
was soon reunited with its owner, but Delgado was intrigued by the
breed. </p>
<p>Fast-forward some years, and he was in the Westminster ring as
Duncan’s breeder, owner and handler, with Davila cheering him on. </p>
<p>“We made a dream come true to be here,” Davila said afterward. “To
share with experienced people in the ring — that was awesome.” </p>
<p>Westminster routinely attracts a roster of dog showing’s heavy
hitters. This year’s field includes Stache, a Sealyham terrier who won
the National Dog Show televised last Thanksgiving, and Comet, a shih tzu
who won the huge American Kennel Club National Championship that was
televised on December 31. </p>
<p>Comet is “just everything you would want in a shih tzu,” co-owner,
breeder and handler Luke Ehricht said after Comet won his breed Monday
morning. With a flowing coat like a vanilla-and-caramel ice cream sundae
that’s melting onto the table, the dog looked up at his handler with the
sweet expression that’s prized in the breed. </p>
<p>“He’s a very sweet, loving dog” who knows when it’s time to perform
and when it’s time to relax, said Ehricht, of Monclova, Ohio. </p>
<p>Later, Frankie, the recovered Afghan hound, and her littermate Belle
stood side-by-side in their breed’s ring. So did the Giordanos, an
Annandale, New Jersey, couple who have been side-by-side since high
school. David handled Frankie, while his wife led Belle. </p>
<p>Both dogs took jaunty spins around the ring, but neither won. Nor did
the recent World Dog Show winner, named Zaida. The ribbon went to
another highly ranked Afghan, named Louis. </p>
<p>“This breed’s supposed to be ‘the king of dogs,’ and he knows he is,”
handler and co-owner Alicia Jones said.</p>

<h2 id="ibm-introduces-entry-level-power10-server-and-tower">IBM
introduces entry-level Power10 server and tower</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>Each S1012 node has a single Power10 processor, which can have 1, 4,
or 8 cores activated, which suggests that it is the same single chip
module (SCM) implementation of the Power10 processor that was used in
the Power S1022s entry machine. The Power S1012 node has four ISDIMM
memory slots (using the differential signaling created by Big Blue for
its Power10 memory) with a maximum capacity of 256 GB. The node has four
half-height, half-length PCI-Express 5.0 slots and room for four
NVM-Express U.2 drive bays that come in a maximum 1.6 TB capacity each
for a total of 6.4 TB of storage. The eight-core version of the Power10
SCM is only available in the rack configuration, while the one-core and
four-core versions are available in rack or tower configurations. The
four-core and eight-core versions can run IBM i, AIX, or Linux, but the
one-core version can only run IBM i and it has its main memory capped at
the same 64 GB that other single-core Power Systems machines have been
subjected to. We have suggested that 128 GB or even 256 GB is more
appropriate given modern workloads, but Big Blue is standing its ground
here. If you need more memory than 64 GB, then this machine is not for
you. ↫ Timothy Prickett Morgan at IT Jungle I understand full well that
these machines are by no means meant for people like you and I, sitting
at home playing with our toys. That being said, I still wish there was
some way for IBM to offer unique hardware like this – perhaps in a more
standard, paired-down configuration – so more people than just
enterprises could explore and use them. It wouldn’t make any economic
sense for IBM to do so, and even in a more standard, paired-down
configuration they’d probably still be ungodly expensive, but when I
look at this unique tower, with its POWER10 hardware and the ability to
run AIX, desires are stirred within me that are banned in at least 46
countries. Such a machine would surely be wasted on someone like me, who
would just be shoehorning whatever desktop tasks he could into it, but
what a grand ol’ time we would have. There is absolutely, positively,
unequivocally zero percent chance IBM would ever send one of these over
for review to someone like me, but I wonder if I should try anyway. I’ve
got nothing to lose. Does anyone here work at IBM? Perhaps IBM wants to
sponsor OSNews? How about like 12 weeks of free sponsorships in exchange
for a tower model of the Power S1012? I also have two POWER9 machines to
compare it to! It’s the only way you’ll ever get a Power S1012
screenfetch screenshot go viral on nerd social media, and we all know
that deep down, that’s all you IBM folks really want.</p>

Power Line Problems Just Got a FERC Fix</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
On the two ends of the energy transition, public policy is working to
encourage more non-carbon-emitting electricity generation (think wind,
solar, and batteries) and convert what was once powered by combustion in
electric power (think electric cars and heat pumps). But then that
leaves the middle.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The solar arrays and wind farms that the federal tax code and many state
policies promote and subsidize can’t serve all that new electric demand
from cars and heat pumps (not to mention existing demand for
electricity) if they can’t connect to the grid. That’s where the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission steps in — not by funding or mandating the
construction of new energy transmission infrastructure, but by laying
out the rules for planning it.<br/>
</p>
<p>
On Monday, FERC unveiled and approved a rule overhauling regional
transmission planning to take into account the ongoing and planned
transformation of the electric grid. Since 2010 at least, energy
planning and construction has been motivated almost solely by
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-10/National_Transmission_Needs_Study_2023.pdf" target="_blank">incremental
need</a>, i.e. the only things that got built were those deemed
necessary to keep the literal lights on. A Department of Energy report
released last year showed that overall transmission investment and
construction has slowed down since the second half of the 2010s. That’s
led to a “queue” of projects waiting to connect that’s around 90%
renewables.
</p>
<p>
All of this is especially distressing as the energy transition will
require a vast expansion of our transmission capacity.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/biden-ai-electricity-demand" target="_blank">Increased
demand</a> from electrification, new manufacturing, data centers, state
policies that mandate the use of renewable energy, federal policies like
the Inflation Reduction Act, and corporate policies that mandate the
procurement of non-carbon-emitting power is transforming the grid.
</p>
<p>
While the 1,300-page rule has not yet been released, FERC commissioners
and staff described new requirements that regional transmission
organizations adopt the long view, extending their planning horizon over
a 20-year period and calling for updates every five years. This means
grid planners will have to take into account factors making the grid
cleaner, including corporate commitments to purchase clean energy,
public policy pushing renewables, the retirement of fossil fuel plants,
and utilities’ own designs for the future.
</p>
<p>
But that’s just the planning process. When it comes to actually building
— and paying for — new transmission, FERC is requiring regional
transmission planners to consult a specific set of economic and
reliability benefits like reducing congestion on the grid and resilience
against extreme weather and lower costs when selecting projects.
</p>
<p>
Many would-be transmission projects founder on how to split up costs
between the various regions and utilities any new infrastructure will
serve. Transmission planners, therefore, often prefer local projects
that serve the existing grid and can thus avoid the tricky business of
how to split the bill. Within the PJM Interconnection, the country’s
largest regional transmission organization, about six times as much
local transmission was approved from 2014 to 2022 compared to regional
transmission,
<a href="https://ceepr.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MIT-CEEPR-WP-2024-03.pdf" target="_blank">according
to research by Massachusetts Institute of Technology economists</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s easy to see why the regional planning process can be contentious
and complex. There’s no one set way to do it because there’s not always
agreement on who benefits and to what extent from any given project.
This has only gotten more true as some states have passed
decarbonization or renewable energy mandates as others have resolutely
not. Under the new rule, transmission planners will have to come up with
a default method for allocating costs associated with new projects as a
fallback in cases of disagreement.
</p>
<p>
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has pushed FERC to make
transmission planning easier,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/transmission-permitting-reform-ferc-schumer" target="_blank">claimed
victory</a> in a press conference following the announcement. He
described the new rule as a “missing piece to the puzzle” of the IRA
that could help jumpstart a transmission buildout. That will be
especially key in the absence of Congressional action. Though hopes were
once at least
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_blank">moderately
elevated</a> that Congress would take steps to accelerate the complex
permitting process for large-scale energy projects this session, any
sense of possibility seems to have disappeared.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve told Joe Manchin, it’s going to be virtually impossible to get
something done,” Schumer told reporters, referring to the barnstorming
West Virginia senator and chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources, who’ll be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/joe-manchin-retiring-west-virginia-senator-inflation-reduction-act" target="_blank">retiring</a>
in January, when his current term expires.
</p>
<p>
While FERC cannot wave a magic wand and fund transmission projects or
get agencies to speed up environmental reviews, it <em>can</em> focus
and direct transmission planners to figure out what kinds of
transmission needs to be built and how it will be paid for. In another
corner of the executive branch, the DOE recently designated 10
“<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-initial-list-high-priority-areas-accelerated" target="_blank">corridors</a>”
where the need for new transmission is particularly acute. Projects in
these areas could be eligible for additional financing and bypass
certain permitting hurdles
</p>
<p>
Environmental groups like the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense
Council, and the Environmental Defense Fund, as well as Senate Democrats
almost immediately hailed the FERC decision. Ray Long, president of the
trade organization the American Council on Renewable Energy, said in a
statement that the rule will “enable the delivery of power from cleaner
and more affordable electricity generation that will benefit consumers
all across America.”
</p>
<p>
The Commission’s sole Republican member, former Virginia regulator Mark
Christie, was not so effusive. He issued a harsh dissent to his
colleagues’ decision, likely previewing a judicial challenge from
Republican-governed states. While the Commission’s chair, former
District of Columbia public service commissioner Willie Phillips, and
its other member, NRDC alum Allison Clements, both Democrats, largely
spoke about the rule in terms of reliability and reforming the planning
process, Christie made it seem like a climate change policy in disguise
that would function as a “transfer of wealth” to wind, solar, and
transmission developers.
</p>
<p>
<strong>“</strong>This is not about reasonable improvements to regional
planning,” Christie said. “This rule is a shell game designed to
disguise its true agenda that is about the money. It’s a 1,300-page
vehicle to socialize the cost of the rule’s sweeping policy agenda.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Christie also raised the prospect that consumers in states
that have not adopted mandates for renewable energy could end up being
forced to pay for transmission projects necessary to connect renewables
to the grid, turning consumers into “involuntary beneficiaries.”
<em></em>While this may not sound so bad, a key principle of allocating
costs for transmission is that whomever benefits — no matter how those
benefits are calculated — should pay. If, as Christie argues, there’s
disagreement over what counts as a benefit, being an involuntary
beneficiary is no good.
</p>
<p>
While the details of the rule remain to be seen, it did not list any
environmental benefit to new transmission as the type of benefit that
transmission needed to tally up when considering a project; instead, it
said that transmission planners should consider how public and corporate
policies are affecting the mix of generation when making their long-term
transmission plans.
</p>
<p>
Commissioner Clements argued in her remarks that this was a narrow
perspective on transmission planning, and that “it is not the
Commission’s job to try and force the genie that is the energy
transition back into the bottle.” States should avoid the temptation to
“get drawn into a lose-lose debate over who, precisely, caused the need
for each specific system upgrade as the grid’s inadequacy festers,” she
added. <br/>
</p>
<p>
Rob Gramlich, the president of Grid Strategies LLC and a leading
transmission advocate, added his voice to Clements’,
<a href="https://twitter.com/RobGramlichDC/status/1790054356961653219" target="_blank">tweeting</a>
that the notion that “beneficiaries should get to opt out of paying for
infrastructure … is counter to every lesson about how every type of
infrastructure has ever been funded.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
While those celebrating no doubt disagree with Christie’s claim about
cost, they agreed that the rule would spur the transition to
non-carbon-emitting sources of power. Just to meet the likely increase
in energy usage from existing policies like the IRA and the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, the DOE estimates there would need to be at least
64% increase in transmission within regions — precisely the type of
planning today’s FERC decision affects.
</p>
<p>
Since the beginning of the Biden administration, FERC has been a key
battleground for the future of energy policy. In 2022, Manchin
<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/manchin-ferc-chairman-richard-glick-confirmation-hearing/636342/" target="_blank">blocked</a>
the reappointment of Richard Glick to the Commission, even though he had
been serving as its chair; another commissioner
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/us-energy-commissions-confront-big-agendas-with-empty-seats" target="_blank">left</a>
at the end of his term last year, and their replacements have
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/what-to-know-about-the-3-ferc-nominees/" target="_blank">not
yet been confirmed</a>. The Commission’s number will dwindle yet again
when Clements’
<a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/blogs/speaking-energy/commissioner-clements-pending-departure-casts-uncertainty-over-ferc#:~:text=Commissioner%20Clements'%20term%20is%20set,on%20the%20Commission%20beyond%20June." target="_blank">term
expires in June</a>, assuming the Senate hasn’t acted by the end of its
current session, which would leave FERC without a quorum.
</p>
<p>
The three-member commission is therefore trying to act as quickly as it
can. “This rule can not come fast enough,” Phillips said.

conduct controlled demolition on collapsed Baltimore bridge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — Crews conducted a controlled demolition Monday to break
down the largest remaining span of the collapsed Francis Scott Key
Bridge in Baltimore. </p>
<p>The explosives flashed orange and let off plumes of black smoke upon
detonation, and the span crumpled into the water in seconds. The longest
trusses toppled away from the grounded Dali container ship and slid off
its bow, sending a wall of water splashing back toward the ship. </p>
<p>It marked a major step in freeing the ship, which has been stuck amid
the wreckage since it lost power and crashed into one of the bridge’s
support columns shortly after leaving Baltimore on March 26. The
demolished span came crashing down on the ship’s bow and remained
resting on its deck for the past six weeks. </p>
<p>The collapse killed six construction workers and halted most maritime
traffic through Baltimore’s busy port. The controlled demolition will
allow the Dali to be refloated and restore traffic through the port as
the cleanup enters its final stages. </p>
<p>Once the ship is removed, maritime traffic can begin returning to
normal, which will provide relief for thousands of longshoremen,
truckers and small business owners who have seen their jobs impacted by
the closure. </p>
<p>Officials previously said the Dali’s 21-member crew would shelter in
place aboard the ship while the explosives were detonated. </p>
<p>In a videographic released this week, authorities said engineers were
using precision cuts to control how the trusses break down. They said
the method allows for “surgical precision” and is one of the safest and
most efficient ways to remove steel under a high level of tension. </p>
<p>The next step is for hydraulic grabbers to lift the resulting
sections of steel onto barges. </p>
<p>The Dali crew members haven’t been allowed to leave the grounded
vessel since the disaster. Officials said they’ve been busy maintaining
the ship and assisting investigators. Of the crew members, 20 are from
India and one is Sri Lankan. </p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board and the FBI are conducting
investigations into the bridge collapse. </p>
<p>Danish shipping giant Maersk had chartered the Dali for a planned
trip from Baltimore to Sri Lanka, but the ship didn’t get far. Its crew
sent a mayday call saying they had lost power and had no control of the
steering system. Minutes later, the ship rammed into the bridge. </p>
<p>Officials have said the safety board investigation will focus on the
ship’s electrical system.</p>

id="macrelix-a-unix-like-environment-that-runs-in-classic-mac-os">MacRelix:
a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>MacRelix is a Unix-like environment that runs in classic Mac OS.
MacRelix natively supports classic 68K and PPC Mac OS, as well as Mac OS
X on PPC via Carbon. ↫ MacRelix website The creator of MacRelix, Josh
Juran, published an article in 2019 detailing the origins of the
project. As a Mac OS developer, he was so unhappy with both CodeWarrior
and Apple’s Macintosh Programmer’s Workshop (MPW), that he set out to
create what would become MacRelix in 1999. Reading through the
limitations and roadblocks he experienced with CodeWarrior and MPW, it’s
not hard to see why he got frustrated – CodeWarrior’s targets were
apparently a mess and a half to deal with. Then came target
multiplication. Whereas the initial CodeWarrior developer releases
shipped with each combination of language (C and Pascal) and
architecture (68K and PPC) supported in a separate application, a later
version of the IDE unified these, allowing the developer to have a
single project file per project. To allow the same project to be built
for both 68K and PPC architectures, the project data model included
targets: One target would compile for 68K and link against 68K
libraries, another would do the same for PPC. Targets could also be used
to select an optimized build versus one for debugging. Combining both
dichotomies yields four targets: 68K debug, 68K optimized, PPC debug,
and PPC optimized. Then if your project involves multiple executables,
like a code resource or shared library in addition to an application,
you now have eight targets. Or, if you support one of, say, 68020
optimization, profiling, or a third executable, make that twelve. Or,
for all of them, twenty-seven. ↫ Josh Juran Changing an option in your
application required you to change it in every single target, too, which
I can easily see is incredibly frustrating. MPW, for its part, was a
massive improvement, he argues, but while it was clearly inspired by
UNIX, it didn’t seem to actually implement any of the features and
characteristics of UNIX. However, very much unlike Unix, the MPW Shell
had only a single thread of execution — only one program could be
running at once. Not only that, but there was no way for MPW’s compiled
plugins (called tools) to invoke other tools or scripts — not even via
system() (which blocks the calling program until the called program
exits). Therefore, Make couldn’t actually do anything, but only printed
out the commands for the user to run manually. You could code in Perl
instead of the built-in language, but then your scripts couldn’t run
other programs — only MPW shell scripts could do that. ↫ Josh Juran The
limitations Juran was experiencing with these two tools pushed him to
create his own solution, which went well beyond what MPW offered, even
in 2019 when this article was published. Nowadays, MacRelix has pipes,
signals, system calls, TCP sockets, and more. It works on both 68K and
PowerPC Mac systems and builds as Carbon to run natively in OS X. It can
be used on any Mac OS version from System 7 to Mac OS X 10.6 “Snow
Leopard” (after which Apple removed the Rosetta PowerPC emulator). I
haven’t implemented fork() yet, but I know how to do it. In addition to
a Unix-like file system interface (which even handles long names by
storing them in Desktop database comment fields)), MacRelix has a /proc
filesystem (with human readable stack crawls) and also maps various
parts of Mac OS (e.g. the ROM image in /sys/mac/rom). ↫ Josh Juran I had
never heard of MacRelix, but it seems like an amazing tool Juran put a
lot of thought, effort, and love into. Sadly, with the number of PowerPC
Mac OS X users being vanishingly small, and the number of classic Mac OS
users even smaller so, the future of MacRelix seems uncertain. I wonder
what parts of it can be salvaged and upgraded to work on ARM macOS or
even Intel macOS, because I think the ideas and concepts are incredibly
cool. A related project by Juran is something called FORGE, a portable
windowing API that used a virtual file system, meaning that instead of
using functions as objects, it uses files. Juran mentions the example of
a window title – which is a file, and if you want to change the title of
that window you just change the file, which will be instantly reflected
in the GUI. Here’s a Hello World example: Even though I’m not a
programmer, this little tidbit of code makes perfect sense to me, and I
understood it instantly. Of course, anything more complex will quickly
leave my wheelhouse, but intuitively, I really like this. FORGE exists
as a prototype inside MacRelix, so you can play with this concept while
using MacRelix.</p>

Is One Signature Away From Making Big Oil Pay for Climate Change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjIxNjQwNi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NjQ5NTE1Mn0.BzNvkei_5BccvZSez6hxLWwh-2dRwlJX6GSqxyP5iTk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
A first-of-its-kind attempt to make fossil fuel companies pay for
climate damages is nearly through the finish line in Vermont. Both
branches of the state legislature voted to pass the Climate Superfund
Act last week, which would
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/climate-superfund-vermont" target="_self"><u>hit
oil and gas companies with a bill</u></a> for the costs of addressing,
avoiding, and adapting to a world made warmer by oil and gas-related
carbon emissions.
</p>
<p>
The bill now heads to the desk of Republican Governor Phil Scott, who
has not said whether he will sign it. If he vetoes it, however, there’s
enough support in the legislature to override his decision, Martin
LaLonde, a representative from South Burlington and lead sponsor of the
bill, told me. “It’s a matter of making sure everybody shows up,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
The Superfund Act is one of several actions the Vermont legislature is
taking to address climate change this year. Another bill would
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/vermont-on-the-cusp-of-mandating-100-clean-electricity-by-2035" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>strengthen
the state’s clean electricity target</u></a>, requiring utilities to
source 100% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2035.
(Existing law sets the target at 75% renewable energy by 2032.) A
<a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/bill/status/2024/S.305" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>third
bill</u></a> pushes forward a number of innovative utility programs,
including Burlington Electric Company’s “gasoline superuser” program
that would incentivize the people who drive the most to switch to an
electric vehicle.
</p>
<p>
In addition to Vermont, four other states are contemplating climate
superfund legislation this year. Climate superfund bills in
<a href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/mgawebsite/Legislation/Details/SB0958?ys=2024rs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Maryland</u></a>
and
<a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/193/S481" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Massachusetts</u></a>
have stalled, but nearly identical policies are still moving through
statehouses in
<a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/S2129/amendment/A#:~:text=BILL%20NUMBER%3A%20S2129%20SPONSOR%3A%20KRUEGER,purpose%20of%20the%20bill%20is" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>New
York</u></a> and
<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1497" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>California</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
All five states have also attempted to sue fossil fuel companies for
damages or misleading the public about the dangers of their products or
both, but none of the cases has yet made it to trial. The Superfund idea
represents a new approach. Oil and gas companies are sure to fight the
law in court, but if they do, the burden of proof will fall on them,
rather than on the states.
</p>
<p>
LaLonde, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee in Vermont, helped
craft the bill early on, working closely with the legislative council.
He wanted to understand the bill’s legal vulnerabilities and any other
issues that could hold it up, but ultimately determined it was an
entirely defensible concept. The bill is modeled after the federal
Superfund law, which gives the Environmental Protection Agency the
authority to recover the cost of cleanup of heavily contaminated sites
from those responsible for the contamination.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s fairly straightforward that these companies should pay
their fair share of remediation,” LaLonde told me, “They’ve made
billions and billions of dollars selling this product and have caused a
lot of damage. And they knew about this. They knew the impacts.”
</p>
<p>
What’s less straightforward is determining what constitutes a fair
share. First, the State Treasurer will be tasked with assessing the cost
incurred by Vermont as a result of global emissions from fossil fuels
between 1995 and 2024 — Vermont incurred damages estimated at hundreds
of millions of dollars from flooding in 2023 alone. The state’s
Department of Natural Resources will also have to map out a resilience
strategy, which would be funded by proceeds from the Superfund law. The
soonest it could begin paying out is 2028, but due to expected legal
challenges, even that timeline is unlikely to hold.
</p>
<p>
“It is a big deal to get moving on this,” said LaLonde. “But boy, we
have a long road to go.”

Senator Robert Menendez’s corruption trial gets underway</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Jury selection began on Monday in the corruption trial of
U.S. Senator Robert Menendez, a case that could affect the Democrat’s
political future and help determine which party controls the Senate next
year.</p>
<p>Menendez, 70, faces 16 criminal charges including bribery, fraud and
acting as a foreign agent, and is being tried alongside two New Jersey
businessmen in Manhattan federal court.</p>
<p>The senator’s wife, Nadine Menendez, has also been charged but will
be tried separately. All four defendants have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein told prospective jurors that the
trial could last six to seven weeks.</p>
<p>Menendez, New Jersey’s senior senator, is up for re-election in
November and if exonerated hopes to run for a fourth full term as an
independent.</p>
<p>Recent polls show Menendez is deeply unpopular among New Jersey
voters, and many Democratic senators including New Jersey’s Cory Booker
have called for him to resign. Democrats and independents who caucus
with them hold a 51-49 Senate majority.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the Menendezes accepted cash, gold bars and a
Mercedes-Benz convertible in exchange for the senator wielding his
political influence in New Jersey and to help the governments of Egypt
and Qatar.  </p>
<p>The senator allegedly promised to help Egypt obtain arms sales and
other military aid, and helped defendant Wael Hana, an Egyptian American
businessman, obtain a lucrative monopoly on the certification of halal
meat exports to Egypt.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also said Menendez tried to help defendant Fred Daibes, a
prominent New Jersey developer, obtain millions of dollars from a Qatari
investment fund, and sought to disrupt a federal criminal case against
Daibes in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Much of the cash received by the Menendezes was stuffed inside
clothing at their home, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Menendez and his wife also face obstruction of justice charges. The
alleged crimes occurred between 2018 and 2023.</p>
<p>A fifth defendant, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty to bribery and fraud
charges in March and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.</p>
<p>Nadine Menendez’s trial is scheduled for July 8. Her case was
separated after her lawyers said she developed a serious medical
condition that required a lengthy recovery.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Robert Menendez have suggested in court papers that if he
testified he may try to blame his wife, disclosing marital
communications that would “tend to exonerate” him but could incriminate
her.</p>
<p>His lawyers said Menendez could explain what they discussed during
dinners with Egyptian officials and offer his wife’s explanation for why
Hana and Uribe “provided her certain monetary items.”</p>
<p>The defense team also wants a psychiatrist to testify that the
senator routinely stored cash in his home because of a “fear of
scarcity.”</p>
<p>Defense lawyers said Menendez did this as a “coping mechanism” after
the Cuban government seized his family’s assets before he was born, and
his father died by suicide after his son stopped paying his gambling
debts.</p>
<p>Menendez’s corruption trial is his second.</p>
<p>In 2017, a New Jersey federal judge declared a mistrial after jurors
deadlocked on whether Menendez broke the law by providing help to a
wealthy ophthalmologist, Salomon Melgen, in exchange for lavish gifts
and political contributions.</p>
<p>Menendez became a senator in 2006. He had chaired the powerful Senate
Foreign Relations Committee but stepped down last September after first
being indicted.</p>
<p>Several other current and former members of Congress also face
federal criminal charges, including Representative Henry Cuellar, a
Texas Democrat, and former representative George Santos, a New York
Republican.</p>
<p>While New Jersey’s voting population leans Democratic, public support
for Menendez collapsed following his indictment.</p>
<p>Fewer than one in six voters polled in March by Monmouth University
and Emerson College Polling/PIX11/The Hill said they approved of
Menendez’s job performance. Even fewer said they would vote for him as
an independent.</p>
<p>Several Senate seats held by Democrats or independents may be closely
contested in November. A seat now held by West Virginia Democrat Joe
Manchin, who is not seeking reelection, is expected to turn
Republican.</p>

<p>
<strong>Opinion</strong>  If your cranky uncle was this fixated about
anything, you’d always be somewhere else at Christmas. Yet here we are
again. Europol has been sounding off at Meta for harming children. Not
for the way it’s actually harming children, but because – repeat after
me – end-to-end encryption is hiding child sexual abuse material from
the eyes of the law. “E2EE = CSAM” is the new slogan of fear.…

infrastructure, and protect civil rights. And I write about how that
so-called liberal consensus broke down as extremists used the
Reconstruction-era image of the American cowboy—who, according to myth,

of the Planet of the Apes’ reigns at the box office with $56.5 million
opening</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” reigned over the
weekend box office with a $56.5 million North American opening,
according to studio estimates Sunday, giving a needed surge to an
uncertain season in theaters.</p>
<p>The film from 20th Century Studios and Disney that built on the
rebooted “Apes” trilogy of the 2010s had the third highest opening of
the year, after the $81.5 million debut of “Dune: Part Two” in early
March and the $58.3 million domestic opening of “Kung Fu Panda 4” a week
later.</p>
<p>The strong performance for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” — it
played even better internationally with a global total of $129 million —
comes a week after a tepid start for Ryan Gosling’s “The Fall Guy”
signaled that the summer of 2024 is likely to see a major drop-off after
the “Barbenheimer” magic of 2023.</p>
<p>“Planet of the Apes” easily made more than the rest of the top 10
combined.</p>
<p>“The Fall Guy” fell to No. 2 with a $13.7 million weekend and a
two-week total of $49.7 million for Universal Pictures.</p>
<p>Zendaya’s “Challengers” was third with $4.7 million and has earned
$38 million in three weeks for Amazon MGM studios.</p>
<p>The opening for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” helmed by “Maze
Runner” director Wes Ball, was the second best in the series, after the
$72 million opening weekend of 2014’s “Dawn of the Planet of the
Apes.”</p>
<p>It’s the 10th movie in the “Planet of the Apes” franchise that began
in 1968 with the Charlton Heston original with a twist ending.</p>
<p>“This franchise has never been allowed to lose its momentum,” said
Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “There are
very few franchises that have this kind of longevity.”</p>
<p>And it really is the property itself. The new film shares no central
actors or characters with its predecessors.</p>
<p>“There’s just this love for the way it melds sci-fi with social
commentary and straight-up popcorn entertainment,” Dergarabedian
said.</p>
<p>“Kingdom” came with strong reviews and positive buzz (80% fresh on
Rotten Tomatoes and a “B” CinemaScore). It was especially praised for
its visual effects and the way its CGI has caught up with its
primates-on-horseback aesthetic even since the last film, 2017’s “War
for the Planet of the Apes.”</p>
<p>Mark Kennedy of The Associated Press called it “thrilling” and
“visually stunning.”</p>
<p>The shot in the arm is welcome for the movie business, but there is
little certainty in the forthcoming summer.</p>
<p>The year so far, lacking an early Marvel movie like 2023’s “Guardians
of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” is running 21% last year’s mid-May total.</p>
<p>While there are potential blockbusters that feel like safe bets
including “Despicable Me 4” and “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” in July,
others like “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” later this month and “Twisters”
later in the summer feel like they could break either way.</p>
<p>Pixar once brought almost guaranteed hits, but June’s “Inside Out 2”
may not thrive like the 2015 original.</p>
<p>“There used to be sure bets we cannot necessarily bank on anymore,”
Dergarabedian said. “It is going to be a bit of a hit-or-miss
slate.”</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

<p>date: 2024-05-13, from: OS News</p>
<p>This article is a partial-rebuttal/partial-confirmation to KGOnTech’s
Apple Vision Pro’s Optics Blurrier &amp; Lower Contrast than Meta Quest
3, prompted by RoadToVR’s Quest 3 Has Higher Effective Resolution, So
Why Does Everyone Think Vision Pro Looks Best? which cites KGOnTech. I
suppose it’s a bit late, but it’s taken me a while to really get a good
intuition for how visionOS renders frames, because there is a metric
shitton of nuance and it’s unfortunately very, very easy to make
mistakes when trying to quantify things. This post is divided into two
parts: Variable Rasterization Rate (VRR) and how visionOS renders frames
(including hard numbers for internal render resolutions and such), and a
testbench demonstrating why photographing the visual clarity of Vision
Pro (and probably future eye tracked headsets) may be more difficult
than a DSLR pointed into the lenses (and how to detect the pitfalls if
you try!). ↫ Shiny Quagsire I did it. I think I managed to find an
article that isn’t just over my head, but also over most of your heads.
How’s that feel?</p>
