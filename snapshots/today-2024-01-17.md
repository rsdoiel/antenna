## Corporations Are Not To Be Loved

date: 2024-01-17, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)

<p>I started using Apple computers — and writing code for them, starting with BASIC — 43 years ago, before the Macintosh, even, and I’ve made this my career. I’ve had all these decades to really, thoroughly delight in these incredible machines and software, and to give a little back with my own apps.</p>

<p>Apple’s positive effect on my life should not be underestimated. My Mom once (lovingly, teasingly) said to me that my alternate career, had all this never happened, was “criminal genius.” Which might have been fun too, but possibly more stressful than I might have liked. At any rate, Apple has saved me from a life of crime, and I should love Apple for that.</p>

<p>But I need to remember, now and again, that Apple is a corporation, and corporations aren’t people, and they can’t love you back. You wouldn’t love GE or Exxon or Comcast — and you shouldn’t love Apple. It’s not an exception to the rule: there are no exceptions.</p>

<p>Apple doesn’t care about you personally in the least tiny bit, and if you were in their way somehow, they would do whatever their might — effectively infinite compared to your own — enables them to deal with you.</p>

<p>Luckily, Apple has just provided us all with a reminder. Just like the sixth finger in an AI-rendered hand, Apple’s policies for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">Distributing apps in the U.S. that provide an external purchase link</a> are startlingly graceless and a jarring, but not surprising, reminder that Apple is not a real person and not worthy of your love.</p>

## Trump Sex Abuse Accuser Testifies Ex-President Shattered Her Reputation

date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK  — With Donald Trump looking on, writer E. Jean Carroll testified Wednesday that the former president shattered her reputation and continues to inspire venom against her from strangers because she claimed he sexually abused her decades ago. 


Carroll, 80, was the first witness in a Manhattan federal court trial to determine damages, if any, that Trump owes her for remarks he made while he was president as he vehemently denied ever attacking her or knowing her. A jury last year already found that Trump sexually abused her and defamed her in October 2022. 


During Carroll's testimony, Trump grimaced, shook his head and animatedly turned to speak to his lawyer, who lobbed multiple objections seeking to prevent the jury from hearing details of her sexual assault allegations. 


"I've paid just about as dearly as it's possible to pay," she said, referencing the damage she said Trump had caused.




She took the stand after a hostile encounter occurred between Trump attorney Alina Habba and Judge Lewis A. Kaplan over the judge's refusal to adjourn the trial on Thursday so Trump can attend his mother-in-law's funeral. 


Habba called the judge's ruling "insanely prejudicial" and the judge soon afterward cut her off, saying he would "hear no further argument on it." 


Habba told the judge: "I will not be spoken to that way, your honor." When she mentioned the funeral again, the judge responded: "It's denied. Sit down. Bring in the jury." 


Carroll's testimony came less than a year after she was in the same chair convincing a jury in the hopes that Trump could be held accountable in a way that would stop him from frequent verbal attacks against her as he campaigns for the presidency. He is the front-runner on the Republican ticket and won the Iowa caucuses on Monday. 


"I'm here because Donald Trump assaulted me and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened. He lied and shattered my reputation," she said. 


Carroll said Trump's public lies about her began in June 2019 and have continued without interruption. 


"He lied last month. He lied on Sunday. He lied yesterday. And I am here to get my reputation back," Carroll said. 


She said she opened a social media website on Tuesday and saw a post that said: "Hey lady, you're a fraud." 


Once, Carroll testified, she was a respected advice columnist. "Now, I'm known as the liar, the fraud and the whack job." 


Because the first jury found that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the 1990s and then defamed her in 2022, the new trial concerns only how much more — if anything — he'll be ordered to pay her for other remarks he made in 2019 while he was president. 


Trump, who is juggling court appearances with campaign stops, sat in on jury selection Tuesday. Before opening statements began, he left for a New Hampshire rally. 


He declared on social media Tuesday that the case was nothing but "fabricated lies and political shenanigans" that had garnered his accuser money and fame. 


"I am the only one injured by this attempted EXTORTION," read a post on his Truth Social platform. 


Carroll, an advice columnist and magazine writer, has said that Trump harmed her deeply. First, she claims, he forced himself on her in a dressing room after a chance meeting at a luxury department store in 1996. Then he publicly impugned her honesty, her motives and even her sanity after she told the story publicly in a 2019 memoir. 


Carroll has maintained she lost millions of readers and her longtime post at Elle magazine, where her "Ask E. Jean" advice column ran for over a quarter-century, because of her allegations and Trump's reaction to them. Elle has said her contract wasn't renewed for unrelated reasons. 


Trump asserts that nothing ever happened between him and Carroll and that he never met her. He says a 1987 party photo of them and their then-spouses "doesn't count" because it was a momentary greeting. 


Trump did not attend the previous trial in the case last May, when a jury found he had sexually abused and defamed Carroll and awarded her $5 million in damages. The jury said, however, that Carroll hadn't proven her claim that Trump raped her. 


Carroll is now seeking $10 million in compensatory damages and millions more in punitive damages. 


The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Carroll has done.

Jaroslav Pelikan:  Origen may … have been the first church father to study Hebrew, “in opposition to the spirit of his time and of his people,” as Jerome says; according to Eusebius, he “learned it thoroughly,” but there is reason to doubt the accuracy of this report. Jerome, however, was rightly celebrated as &#8220;a trilingual [&#8230;]

## Webb Shows Many Early Galaxies Looked Like Pool Noodles, Surfboards

date: 2024-01-17, from: NASA breaking news

Researchers analyzing images from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have found that galaxies in the early universe are often flat and elongated, like surfboards and pool noodles – and are rarely round, like volleyballs or frisbees. “Roughly 50 to 80% of the galaxies we studied appear to be flattened in two dimensions,” explained lead author [&#8230;]

Manton was asking why weren't his ideas on archiving incorporated in other people's work, it's the same concern I have, why didn't we work together on this Manton? Two heads are better than one in things like this. I think Automattic may be the place to get together on this. Esp since they are the market leader now in this area.

ChatGPT is like having a programming partner you can try ideas out on, or ask for alternative approaches, and they're always there, and not too busy to help out. They know everything you don't know and need to know, and rarely hallucinate (you have to check the work, same as with a human btw). It's remarkable how much it is like having an ideal human programming partner. It's the kind of helper I aspire to be.

## Pluralistic: The super-rich got that way through monopolies (17 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-17, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links The super-rich got that way through monopolies: A report in honor of Davos. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading The super-rich got that way through monopolies (permalink) Just in time for Davos, here's 'Taken, not earned: How monopolists drive the world’s power and wealth divide," a report from a coalition of international tax justice and anti-corporate activist groups: https://www.balancedeconomy.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Davos-Taken-not-Earned-full-Report-2024-FINAL.pdf Everyone &#8211; even the World Economic Forum &#8211; says that wealth inequality is a serious problem, corroding our politics and our social cohesion. What this report does is link that inequality to monopolies, which produce the billionaires who are wrecking the world. The rise of monopolies over the past 40 years came about as the result of specific, deliberate policy choices. As the report documents, the wealthiest people in America funneled a fortune into neutering antitrust enforcement, through the "consumer welfare" doctrine. This is an economic theory that equates monopolies with efficiency: "If everyone is buying the same things from the same store, that tells you the store is doing something right, not something criminal." 40 years ago, and ever since, the wealthy have funded think-tanks, university programs and even "continuing education" programs for federal judges to push this line: https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down They didn't do this for ideological reasons &#8211; they were chasing material goals. Monopolies produce vast profits, and those profits produce vast wealth. The rise and rise of the super rich cannot be decoupled from the rise and rise of monopolies. If you're new to this, you might think that "monopoly" only refers to a sector in which there is only one seller. But that's not what economists mean when they talk about monopolies and monopolization: for them, a monopoly is a company with power. Economists who talk about monopolies mean companies that "can act independently without needing to consider the responses of competitors, customers, workers, or even governments." One way to measure that power is through markups ("the difference between the selling price of goods or services and their cost"). Very large companies in concentrated industries have very high markups, and they're getting higher. From 2017-22, the 20 largest companies in the world had average markups of 50%. The 100 largest companies average 43%. The smallest half of companies get average markups of 25%. Those markups rose steeply during the covid lockdowns &#8211; and so did the wealth of the billionaires who own them. Tech billionaires &#8211; Bezos, Brin and Page, Gates and Ballmer &#8211; all made their fortunes from monopolies. Warren Buffet is a proud monopolist who says "the single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power… if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by 10 percent, then you’ve got a terrible business." We are living in the age of the monopoly. In the 1930s, the top 0.1% of US companies accounted for less than half of America's GDP. Today, it's 90%. And it's accelerating, with global mergers climbing from 2,676 in 1985 to 62,000 in 2021. Monopoly's cheerleaders claim that these numbers vindicate them. Monopolies are so efficient that everyone wants to create them. Those efficiencies can be seen in the markups monopolies can charge, and the profits they can make. If a monopoly has a 50% markup, that's just the "efficiency of scale." But what is the actual shape of this "efficiency?" How is it manifest? The report's authors answer this with one word: power. Monopolists have the power "to extract wealth from, to restrict the freedoms of, and to manipulate or steer the vastly larger numbers of losers." They establish themselves as gatekeepers and create chokepoints that they can use to raise prices paid by their customers and lower the payout to their suppliers: https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ These chokepoints let monopolies usurp "one of the ultimate prerogatives of state power: taxation." Amazon sellers pay a 51% tax to sell on the platform. App Store suppliers pay a 30% tax on every dollar they make with their apps. That translates into higher costs. Consider a good that costs $10 to make: the bottom 50% of companies (by size) would charge $12.50 for that product on average. The largest companies would charge $15. Thus monopolies don't just make their owners richer &#8211; they make everyone else poorer, too. This power to set prices is behind the greedflation (or, more politely, "seller's inflation"). The CEOs of the largest companies in the world keep getting on investor calls and bragging about this: https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power The food system is incredibly monopolistic. The Cargill family own the largest commodity trader in the world, which is how they built up a family fortune worth $43b. Cargill is one of the "ABCD" companies ("Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus") that control the world's food supply, and they tripled their profits during the lockdown. Monopolies gouge everyone &#8211; even governments. Pfizer charged the NHS £18-22/shot for vaccines that cost £5/shot to make. They took the British government for £2bn &#8211; that's enough to pay last year's pay hike for NHS nurses, six times over, But monopolies also abuse their suppliers, especially their employees. All over the world, competition authorities are uncovering "wage fixing" and "no poaching" agreements among large firms, who collude to put a cap on what workers in their sector can earn. Unions report workers having their pay determined by algorithms. Bosses lock employees in with noncompetes and huge repayment bills for "training": https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose Monopolies corrupt our governments. Companies with huge markups can spend some of that money on lobbying. The 20 largest companies in the world spend more than €155m/year lobbying in the US and alone, not counting the money they spend on industry associations and other cutouts that lobby on their behalf. Big Tech leads the pack on lobbying, accounting for 82% of EU lobbying spending and 58% of US lobbying. One key monopoly lobbying priority is blocking climate action, from Apple lobbying against right-to-repair, which creates vast mountains of e-waste, to energy monopolist lobbying against renewables. And energy companies are getting more monopolistic, with Exxonmobil spending $65b to buy Pioneer and Chevron spending $60b to buy Hess. Many of the world's richest people are fossil fuel monopolists, like Charles and Julia Koch, the 18th and 19th richest people on the Forbes list. They spend fortunes on climate denial. When people talk about the climate impact of billionaires, they tend to focus on the carbon footprints of their mansions and private jets, but the true environmental cost of the ultra rich comes from the anti-renewables, pro-emissions lobbying they buy with their monopoly winnings. The good news is that the tide is turning on monopolies. A coalition of "businesses, workers, farmers, consumers and other civil society groups" have created a "remarkably successful anti-monopoly movement." The past three years saw more regulatory action on corporate mergers, price-gouging, predatory pricing, labor abuses and other evils of monopoly than we got in the past 40 years. The business press &#8211; cheerleaders for monopoly &#8211; keep running editorials claiming that enforcers like Lina Khan are getting nothing done. Sure, WSJ, Khan's getting nothing done &#8211; that's why you ran 80 editorial about her: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/14/making-good-trouble/#the-peoples-champion (Khan's winning like crazy. Just last month she killed four megamergers:) https://www.thesling.org/the-ftc-just-blocked-four-mergers-in-a-month-heres-how-its-latest-win-fits-into-the-broader-campaign-to-revive-antitrust/ The EU and UK are taking actions that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. Canada is finally set to get a real competition law, with the Trudeau government promising to add an "abuse of dominance" rule to Canada's antitrust system. Even more exciting are the moves in the global south. In South Africa, "competition law contains some of the most progressive ideas of all": It actively seeks to create greater economic participation, particularly for ‘historically disadvantaged persons’ as part of its public interest considerations in merger decisions. Balzac wrote, "Behind every great fortune there is a crime." Chances are, the rapsheet includes an antitrust violation. Getting rid of monopolies won't get rid of all the billionaires, but it'll certainly get rid of a hell of a lot of them.

## How Climate Denial Is Changing

date: 2024-01-17, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Nashville recorded sub-zero temperatures for only the second time since 1996 • Heavy rains left at least 11 dead in Rio de Janeiro • Invasive and deadly fire ants have been spotted “rafting” on Australian flood waters.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Climate denial tactics are changing </h3><p>
<strong></strong>The climate denial movement has entered a new phase, suggests new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=808b5ce620&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The study analyzed transcripts of more than 12,000 climate-related YouTube videos posted since 2018 and found evidence that “old denial” narratives (Global warming isn’t real! Humans have nothing to do with it!) are becoming less common as the effects of climate change become undeniable. But they’re being replaced by what the researchers call “new denial” tactics. These narratives focus on discrediting climate solutions like renewable energy projects and electric vehicles, or downplaying the harmful effects of global warming. “New denial” claims more than tripled since 2018; “old denial” claims were down by one-third.

</p><p>
	The shift exposes a gap in YouTube’s disinformation policies: While the platform has cracked down on advertising on videos that deny outright that climate change is real, no such rules exist for the wave of “new denial.” The study estimates YouTube could be making up to $13.4 million per year in ad revenue from channels that promote denial. “Given that the battleground has shifted and the new denial is the biggest component of climate denial content overall, it’s time for them to extend their rules to that as well,” Imran Ahmed, founder and chief executive officer of the CCDH, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1ecffa3675&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Bloomberg Green.</em>
</p><h3>2. Shipping emissions on the rise due to Red Sea conflict </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping sector are increasing due to ongoing disruption in the Red Sea, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8f7b9f60eb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>. The Red Sea is the gateway to the Suez Canal, which offers a quick route for ships transporting goods from Asia to Europe. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have been attacking ships in the region in response to the Israel-Hamas war. To avoid the conflict, vessels are taking longer routes via the southern tip of Africa and burning more fuel as a result. The average container vessel transporting goods from China to Rotterdam via the Suez Canal would spew about 41,000 tons of carbon dioxide, but that total jumps to 55,000 tons if that ship has to go the long way, <em>Reuters</em> says. And as ships increase their speeds to make up for lost time, they produce even more pollution. International shipping already accounts for about 2% of global energy-related CO2, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a1df136a28&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the International Energy Agency.</p><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p>

<strong></strong>Southeast Asia has increased its solar- and wind-power capacity by 20% in the last year, according to a new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9ef39586d3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from Global Energy Monitor (GEM). The analysis looks at the energy mix across 10 countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). These include Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Cambodia. It finds that solar and wind account for 9% of electricity generating capacity in the region, and flags Vietnam as being a regional leader. When combined with hydropower, geothermal, and bioenergy, this brings the ASEAN bloc’s renewable capacity to 32%, which is very near its goal of 35% by 2025. GEM says this target is therefore “unambitious.” The report cautions that fossil fuel use is likely to rise in the region as “energy demands are outpacing utility-scale solar and wind development.”
</p><h3>4. Mountain goats are becoming more nocturnal </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Mountain goats are daytime creatures, and they usually do most of their foraging while the sun is up. But as global temperatures rise, they are becoming more active at night, according to a new study <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6229b55e17&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">seen by<em> The Guardian</em></a>. Researchers from the University of Sassari, in Sardinia, tracked the behaviors of the Alpine ibex goat over 13 years and found that on especially warm days, the animals were more likely to be active at night, even though this put them at higher risk of being attacked by predators. “We can expect that during the night when the temperature is lower other animals will shift their activity towards the nocturnal hours,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e341c95f78&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Francesca Brivio</a>, who co-authored the study, tells <em>The Guardian</em>. “If during the day it is too hot to eat or to be active, they will prefer to perform all their activities, like foraging, at night.”

## Bank fees, Apple fees and shipping fees

date: 2024-01-17, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Many of the nation&#8217;s largest banks have reported mixed results recently. Banks often turn to fees – including overdraft charges – to help boost their bottom lines. But a Biden administration rule announced Wednesday would reduce those fees and save consumers billions a year. Then, Apple is making changes to its App Store but will still charge a hefty commission. And shipping rates have soared following continued Red Sea attacks.</p>

## Code Written with AI Assistants Is Less Secure

date: 2024-01-17, updated: 2024-01-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI&#8217;s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants&#8217; language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</p></blockquote>

The vehicle, which once again came in traditional hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants, earned enthusiasm from buyers and <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-prius-hybrid-2024-car-of-the-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plaudits</a> from the auto press. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23462123/2023-toyota-prius-glow-up-redesign-still-hybrid-not-ev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What Toyota didn’t do</a>, curiously, was finally turn the Prius into a true battery electric vehicle. </p><p>The world’s largest car company has been among the slowest of the major automakers to embrace 100% electric propulsion. Yet, as Heatmap data shows, such heel-dragging hasn’t dinged Toyota’s green reputation. In our <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_blank">November 2023 survey</a>, Toyota scored the second-highest on perceived sustainability of any automaker.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

</p><p>Audi’s E-Tron, VW’s ID.4, Kia’s Soul EV, BMW’s i3, and Hyundai’s Kona Electric were all on sale in the U.S. well before the <a href="https://www.toyota.com/bz4x/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bZ4X</a>, Toyota’s first mass market EV. Yet none of those cars could transform American attitudes about companies that made them. While Tesla’s notoriety helped it to top our sustainability survey, the likes of Audi, Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai, and BMW all scored below Toyota.</p><p>To be clear, Toyota certainly earned some sustainable bona fides. The Prius for years was the icon of conspicuous conscientious driving. Eventually, the car of the eco-minded became the car of anybody who wanted to get great gas mileage. In selling <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a46274770/hybrid-history-toyota-prius-porsche/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">six million Priuses</a>, Toyota helped countless drivers post far better mpg than they otherwise would have. And let us not forget the Toyota Mirai, which since 2014 has been the best mainstream option for anybody who wants to drive a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle.</p><p>But the results go to show that even at the dawn of the mainstream EV era, more goes into the popular idea of “sustainability” than purely electric cars. </p><p>Volkswagen, for example, may have introduced a popular EV with the ID.4 crossover, but many respondents surely remember the <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15339250/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-vw-diesel-emissions-scandal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scandal</a> over VW’s diesel emissions and punished the German giant for its misdeeds.</p><p>Or consider the case of Subaru, which was not part of this survey. The brand incessantly advertises itself as a friend of the National Park System and touts its corporate donations to climate causes. Its car show launch events and television commercials depict Subarus in outdoor environments. Given its public image, I’d have to guess that Subaru would have scored highly. Yet none of its vehicles get particularly high gas mileage. (There is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=214106706339905" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Subaru commercial</a> that drives my wife and me crazy, in which a teacher describes her 240-mile daily carbon-spewing commute like it’s a badge of honor.) Like Toyota, Subaru was slow into the EV market; its first, the Solterra, just came out last year. It was co-developed with Toyota and is fundamentally the same car as the bZ4X.</p><p>Despite leading the charge on hybrids and hydrogen, Toyota’s electric enthusiasm has been tepid at best. Whereas many auto giants have trotted out new electrics or teased battery-powered versions of their iconic gas vehicles, Toyota’s attitude more mirrored the general public’s: <em>We’ll just wait until the charging infrastructure makes this more practical for daily driving, thank you very much. </em>In the meantime, the brand touts its “electrified” lineup, which, aside from the bZ4X, is made up entirely of hybrids that also burn gasoline.</p><p>And to drive the point home, Toyota has also actively <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worked against</a> emissions regulations, repeatedly <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2022/08/toyotas-green-image-isnt-what-you-think-for-one-where-are-electric-vehicles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lobbying</a> against such efforts. In 2021, the company <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/toyota-motor-company-pay-180-million-settlement-decade-long-noncompliance-clean-air-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">settled</a> with the U.S. government for $180 million for failing to comply with Clean Air Act regulations. Hino, a truck- and bus-making division of Toyota, was caught falsifying engine emissions data going back decades.</p><p>Seeing the lukewarm reception given many legacy carmakers’ EV offerings, it’s hard to blame Toyota for languishing in the rear, content to keep selling fossil-fuel burning vehicles for as long as it’s profitable. It also must answer a tricky question: What is the EV Prius? The hybrid standard-bearer had a clear identity as an eggshell that delivered top gas mileage. In the EV space, where even big vehicles deliver excellent mileage equivalence, it’s unclear what the Prius brand name will mean.</p><p>But pretty soon, Toyota needs to pounce. The company is clearly getting a little closer to ready: A couple of months ago I came to praise the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/toyota-hilux-revo-ev-tacoma-america" target="_self">Hilux EV</a>, a prototype fully electric version of Toyota’s global best-selling compact truck. That project was a one-off built by engineers overseas, but it points the way to how Toyota could flex its global muscles to help turn the world fleet over to EVs. Toyota is also seen as among the most reliable carmakers — for example, Toyota and its sub-brand Lexus topped the 2023 <em>Consumer Reports</em> <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/who-makes-the-most-reliable-cars-a7824554938/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reliability rankings.</a> That, combined with its reputation for sustainability, could be enough to convince hesitant car shoppers to go fully electric once the brand finally rolls out EV editions of the Camry, RAV4, or, yes, the Prius.</p><p>The bZ4X might have been <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/toyota/bz4x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uninspiring</a>, but that’s not what really matters. What matters is that Toyota is finally moving into true EVs — and soon, we hope, it will do a lot more to back up its good name among climate-friendly companies.</p><p><em>The Heatmap Climate Poll of 1,000 American adults was conducted by Benenson Strategy Group via online panels from Nov. 6 to 13, 2023. The survey included interviews with Americans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.</em></p>

## Rob Kerchner | Who’s the Fascist?

date: 2024-01-17, from: The Signal

<p>One hundred years ago, progressives were touting a “scientific consensus” in eugenics to support abortion, racism and antisemitism. Individual lives and liberties were dismissed; instead, groupthink and top-down control “for the good of society” drove their dreams of social(ist) “progress.” Sound familiar? A hundred years later the same ilk are busily touting a “scientific consensus” [&#8230;]</p>

## January 16, 2024 

date: 2024-01-17, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

[Warning: paragraphs 6&#8211;8 talk about rape.] In yesterday&#8217;s Iowa caucus, 51% of Republican caucusgoers chose former president Donald Trump as their preferred candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Twenty-one percent of Republican caucusgoers chose Florida governor Ron DeSantis. Nineteen percent chose former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. Seven percent chose technology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. These results mean that 20 of Iowa&#8217;s 40 delegates will go to Trump; 8 to DeSantis; 7 to Haley; and three to Ramaswamy. An apparent Trump surrogate in the primary debates, Ramaswamy suspended his campaign after the caucus and endorsed Trump.

## Trump Back in Court for Second Defamation Trial After Iowa Victory

date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Fresh off a campaign victory in Iowa, Donald Trump sat in a New York courtroom on Tuesday to defend himself for a second time against charges that he defamed writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of raping her decades ago.


Trump watched from the defendant's table as Carroll's lawyer told a jury that the then-U.S. president made her life miserable when she went public in 2019 with her story that he had attacked her in a department store dressing room in Manhattan.


"He used the world's biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll, to humiliate her, and to destroy her reputation," lawyer Shawn Crowley said.


Carroll, 80, is seeking at least $10 million in damages in a civil case that will put the allegations of sexual assault back in the headlines while Trump pursues the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.


Jurors will only consider how much Trump should pay Carroll in damages, not whether the alleged assault took place or whether Trump lied about it afterward.


Crowley said Trump's "horrible" lies unleashed a torrent of abuse from his followers and wrecked her sense of safety.


"As he's campaigning for president of the United States, Donald Trump continues to lie about Ms. Carroll," Crowley said.


Trump's lawyer Alina Habba countered that Carroll was "basking in the limelight" in the years since she released her memoir and accused Trump of rape.


"She is looking for you to give her a windfall because some people on social media said mean things about her," Habba said.


Trump, 77, has said he wants to testify.


U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan has barred him from arguing that he did not defame or sexually assault Carroll or that she made up her account.


Nevertheless, Trump accused Carroll on social media of lying as court proceedings got underway on Tuesday morning.


Shortly after the court adjourned for the day, Trump accused Kaplan of being politically biased against him, echoing complaints he has made against judges overseeing his other cases.


Trump could spend much of this year shuttling between campaign rallies and courtrooms, as he seeks to win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.


He won the first state contest in Iowa on Monday by a wide margin, and opinion polls show him leading in the next contest in New Hampshire a week from Tuesday.


"I should be in New Hampshire, campaigning and fighting for our Country, and I will be later today, but for now I had to spend time in a Federal Courthouse with a Trump Hating, Radical Left Judge," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform after the court adjourned for the day.


Trump has pleaded not guilty in four criminal cases that could potentially land him in prison before the November presidential election, including two that accuse him of trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. He also is a defendant in at least two other civil cases.


Kaplan said he expects the trial to last three to five days.


Second trial


Trump's high profile was apparent as prospective jurors were screened for the case. Many acknowledged they were familiar with Trump's various legal troubles, though none said they knew the details of the first defamation trial.


One said she used to work for his daughter Ivanka. She was not chosen for the jury.


Jurors' identities are being kept confidential.


Trump has already lost one defamation case against Carroll.


A jury last May ordered Trump to pay the former Elle magazine columnist $5 million for having sexually abused her during the encounter and defaming her in 2022 by denying that it happened. Trump skipped that trial.


Trump is appealing the $5 million award and could appeal any award at the second trial. Appeals could take years.


In both cases, Trump has said he did not know Carroll and that she invented their encounter to sell her memoir.


Kaplan has barred Trump from suggesting he did not rape Carroll, as New York's penal law defines the term, because the first jury did not find that Trump committed rape. Kaplan has ruled that Carroll's rape claim was "substantially true."


Trump also cannot discuss DNA evidence or Carroll's sexual activities or suggest that Democrats are bankrolling her case.


As at the first trial, jurors will be able to see the 2005 "Access Hollywood" video where Trump graphically described the ability of famous people like himself to have sexual relations with beautiful women.


Kaplan has said the video could offer "useful insight into Mr. Trump's state of mind" toward Carroll.


On social media, Trump accused Kaplan of being "biased," echoing attacks he has made on judges overseeing some of his other cases.

## US to Relist Yemen's Houthis as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, AP Sources Say

date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is expected to soon announce plans to redesignate Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen as specially designated global terrorists, according to two people familiar with the White House decision and a U.S. official.


The move comes as the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The group says it has attacked the ships in response to Israel's military operations in Gaza in the aftermath of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.


The three people familiar with the decision were not authorized to comment and requested anonymity to discuss the matter ahead of the expected formal announcement.


Secretary of State Antony Blinken delisted the Houthis as both a foreign terrorist organization and as specially designated global terrorists in February 2021 as the administration sought to make it easier to get food imports and humanitarian aid into Yemen.


In its waning days, the Trump administration designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization over the strong objections of human rights and humanitarian aid groups.


The foreign terrorist designation barred Americans and people and organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction from providing "material support" to the Houthis, which the groups said would result in an even greater humanitarian catastrophe than what was already happening in Yemen.


Shortly after the Biden administration took office, Blinken removed the designations in a step that was roundly criticized by conservative lawmakers and others but was intended to keep much-needed food, medicine and other aid flowing to Yemen.


Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula bordering the Red Sea, is the poorest country in the Arab world. War and chronic misgovernment have left 24 million Yemenis at risk of hunger and disease as of 2023, and roughly 14 million in acute need of assistance, the United Nations says. About two-thirds of Yemenis live in territory controlled by the Houthis.


While supporters of broad sanctions argue it's possible to shape any enforcement mechanisms to exempt food and humanitarian aid, aid organizations worry that fears of running afoul of U.S. regulation could scare away shippers, banks and other players vital to Yemen's commercial food supply. Arid Yemen imports 90% of its food.


"This designation would add another level of uncertainty and threat for Yemenis still caught in one of the world's largest humanitarian crises," said Scott Paul, an associate director of Oxfam America. "The Biden administration is playing with fire, and we call on them to avoid this designation immediately and prioritize the lives of Yemenis now."


The specially designated global terrorists label to be reimposed on the Houthis does not include sanctions for providing "material support," and it does not come with travel bans that are also imposed with the foreign terrorist organization label, steps intended to help prevent the U.S. move from harming ordinary Yemenis.


Meanwhile, a senior White House official said Tuesday that addressing the ongoing threat by Yemen's Houthi rebels on commercial vessels in the Red Sea is an "all hands on deck" problem that the U.S. and allies must address together to minimize impact on the global economy.


"How long this goes on and how bad it gets comes down not just to the decisions of the countries in the coalition that took strikes last week," White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.


The Iran-backed Houthi group has launched dozens of attacks since November on vessels in the Red Sea, a vital corridor for the world's shipping traffic, in what they say is an effort to support Palestinians in the war with Israel. U.S. and British forces have responded by carrying out dozens of air and sea strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen since Friday. The attacks by the Houthis have continued.


Linda Thomas Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said last week that 2,000 ships since November have been forced to divert thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea. Houthi militants have threatened or taken hostage mariners from more than 20 countries.


The Red Sea attacks have already caused significant disruptions to global trade. Oil prices have edged higher in recent days, though Brent crude futures were down slightly in early trading Tuesday.


The U.S. launched a new strike against the Houthis on Tuesday, hitting anti-ship missiles in the third assault on the Iranian-backed group in recent days. The strike came as the Iranian-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile attack against the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia in the Red Sea. No one was injured.


Sullivan said it was critical that countries with influence on Tehran and other Middle East capitals make it clear "that the entire world rejects wholesale the idea that a group like the Houthis can basically hijack the world."


President Joe Biden's senior adviser acknowledged that the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea as well as groups allied with Iran carrying out attacks in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen pose concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could escalate even as Israeli officials have indicated a shift in intensity in their military campaign.


"We have to guard against and be vigilant against the possibility that in fact, rather than heading towards de-escalation, we are on a path of escalation that we have to manage," Sullivan said.


The comments from Sullivan came after Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said during an appearance at the Davos forum that the situation in the Middle East is a "recipe for escalation everywhere." He said Qatar believes that ending the conflict in Gaza will stop the Houthis and militant groups from launching attacks elsewhere in the region.


Sullivan on Tuesday met with Al Thani as well as Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Iraqi Kurdish Prime Minister Masrour Barzani, according to the White House.


Iran fired missiles late Monday at what it said were Israeli "spy headquarters" in an upscale neighborhood near the sprawling U.S. Consulate compound in Irbil, the seat of Iraq's northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and at targets linked to the extremist Islamic State group in northern Syria.


Iraq on Tuesday called the attacks, which killed several civilians, a "blatant violation" of Iraq's sovereignty and recalled its ambassador from Tehran.

## Update: The Family Who Died at Eagle Pass

Often lost in the gamesmanship of border politics are details of those who tragically die trying to get to this country. In 2022, the most recent year for which records are available, nearly 700 people perished or disappeared trying to come to the United States. The International Organization for Migration says this is the deadliest land route for migrants worldwide.

## 86-DOS revisited

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

Recently, the oldest known versions of DOS were uploaded to the internet, and Michal Necasek dove into the floppy images. Even after more than 40 years(!), old software releases and pre-releases can still surface. In the case of 86-DOS 0.11 and 0.34 it’s practically a miracle, since there were probably never very many copies in existence. For the first time since the early 1980s, FAT formatted floppies with the primordial 16-byte directory entry format have come to light. The old 16-byte directory entries were gone by 86-DOS 1.0 in April 1981 and of course never appeared in any public PC DOS release. These prehistoric versions of 86-DOS allow us to fill in further missing pieces in the puzzle of DOS origins. It is fascinating to follow how DOS developed from almost nothing to a multi-million dollar business in the course of just a few years. ↫ Michal Necasek It started out so humbly. Yet, here we are, in 2024, and variants of DOS still have their uses in certain niches. An incredible legacy, for sure.

## A shocking amount of the web is machine translated: insights from multi-way parallelism

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

We show that content on the web is often translated into many languages, and the low quality of these multi-way translations indicates they were likely created using Machine Translation (MT). Multi-way parallel, machine generated content not only dominates the translations in lower resource languages; it also constitutes a large fraction of the total web content in those languages. We also find evidence of a selection bias in the type of content which is translated into many languages, consistent with low quality English content being translated en masse into many lower resource languages, via MT. Our work raises serious concerns about training models such as multilingual large language models on both monolingual and bilingual data scraped from the web. ↫ Brian Thompson, Mehak Preet Dhaliwal, Peter Frisch, Tobias Domhan, Marcello Federico As a translator myself, this is entirely unsurprising. Translating is a craft, a skill, and much like with any other craft, you get what you pay for. If you pay your translator(s) a good rate, you get a good translation. If you pay your translator(s) a shit rate, you get a shit translation. If you pay nothing, you get nothing. I&#8217;m definitely seeing more and more people in my industry integrate machine translations, but so far, it&#8217;s not been an actual issue &#8211; I have no qualms about accepting a job where I take a machine-translated text and whip it into shape and turn it into a human-readable, quality translation&#8230; As long as people pay me a reasonable rate for it. Working from a machine translation is often quicker and easier, so the going rate obviously reflects that. The quality of machine translations is absolutely atrocious, however, and the idea of relying on it for texts other people &#8211; customers, clients, employees, etc. &#8211; are actually supposed to read and work from is terrifying. Google Translate is an effective tool for personal use, but throwing, I don&#8217;t know, your product&#8217;s manual at it and dumping the unedited result onto your customers is borderline criminal. Pay nothing, get nothing.

## There’s a New Kind of Energy Risk: Cold Winter Mornings

date: 2024-01-16, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA5Nzc3My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2Njc5MDA0OX0.OgihpxFQFPC4gUOVUynK8W3jQPoNULLs4f4f2iWYVVY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>The Texas grid has had <a href="https://www.star-telegram.com/news/weather-news/article284237998.html" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/ercot-asks-texans-to-conserve-energy-tuesday-morning-during-winter-weather/" target="_blank">close calls</a> already this week, leading ERCOT, the electricity market that covers about 90% of the state, to ask households, businesses, and government agencies to conserve energy due to high demand. These calls for moderation are nothing new — ERCOT issued several of them issued this summer, when temperatures were <a href="https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-hottest-august-ever-recorded-18342578.php#:~:text=The%20average%20high%20temperature%20in,previous%20record%20of%2012%20days." target="_blank">over 100 degrees Fahrenheit</a> in much of the state. What’s new is that these calls weren’t coming on sweltering afternoons, but rather on freezing mornings.</p><p>
	Traditionally, we start to get nervous about the electric grid in the summertime around sunset. With air conditioners running and people getting home from work, demand for electricity goes up just as a major source of it (that is, solar power) starts to taper off. This effect is known in California as the “<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=56880" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">duck curve</a>,” and in Texas as the “<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/september-heat-solar-duck-curve" target="_self">dead armadillo curve</a>,” referring to the shape of graphs showing hourly demand on the grid.
</p><p>
	The basic issue on very cold days like the ones Texas has been experiencing is that people wake up and start consuming electricity — especially heat, which is largely electric in Texas — before the sun comes up. Solar power provides around a fifth of the state’s electricity in the afternoon, even in winter. But at 7 a.m. on a January morning in Austin, the sun is nowhere to be found. Add on the fact that the rest of the system, especially its natural gas production system and power plants, is at risk of weather-related issues — <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/report-texas-blackouts-caused-by-frozen-power-generators-gas-facilities" target="_blank">sometimes literally freezing</a> — and winter, especially winter mornings, become very touch-and-go.
</p><p>
	While the Texas grid is <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/texas-grid-cold-uri" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">unique</a> in its relatively free-market organization and isolation from the rest of the country, it is certainly not unique in experiencing winter — if anything, more of the country may start to look like Texas. Not every decarbonized energy system would be at the mercy of very cold mornings, and batteries for storing excess electricity on the grid can help fill gaps when solar is unavailable. But decarbonization nationwide will necessarily lead to load growth, which means that making it so you can get out of bed and keep your toes warm will put pressure on electricity systems everywhere.
</p><p>
<strong></strong><a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/about/key-stats/electricity-use#:~:text=For%20normal%20winter%20weather%2C%20net,30%2C611%20MW%20in%202032%2D2033." target="_blank">New England’s grid</a> is forecasting that its winter peak demand will increase around 3% per year, three times faster than the summer peak, with some 3,000 megawatts of that 6,000 to 9,000 MW projected increase coming from electrification of home heating. In New York, grid planners expect <a href="https://www.nyiso.com/-/how-winter-energy-use-may-grow-with-electrification" target="_blank">heating-related demand to double over 30 years</a>, and even surpass summer demand by around 2040 thanks to a combination of electric vehicle adoption and the use of heat pumps for home heating. In Quebec, which features a unique combination of extremely cold winter temperatures and plentiful green energy in the form of hydropower from its massive dams, plus home heating systems that are <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/o1/en/plus/2717-heat-how-canadians-heat-their-home-during-winter" target="_blank">mostly electric</a> already, demand tends to peak on <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/extreme-cold-jan-21-quebec-hydro-consumption-1.6322688" target="_blank">very cold winter days</a>.
</p><p>
	While Texas is unlikely to pursue climate policy as aggressive as New England, New York, or (shudders) Canada, it does have a burgeoning renewables sector and an incumbent electrified home heating system that leaves it vulnerable to weather-dictated swings in demand.
</p><p>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/texas-grid-cold-uri" target="_self">And Texas has been uncommonly cold</a> lately. In Austin, temperatures have remained below freezing since very early Sunday morning, dipping as low as 18 degrees on Monday and Tuesday mornings. In Houston, temperatures got as low as 20 on Tuesday morning. The system burst through its January demand record by <a href="https://www.ercot.com/news/release/2024-01-15-ercot-expects-tight" target="_blank">5,000 megawatts</a> early this week, breaking a record set in late 2022 during Winter Storm Elliott.<br/>
</p><p>
	This time, the grid was able to meet the high winter demand without malfunctioning, unlike during 2021’s Winter Storm Uri, when much of the state’s generation system tripped offline for days, resulting in prolonged blackouts and hundreds of deaths.
</p><p>
	Since Winter Storm Uri, advocates and analysts have bemoaned that while Texas does have electrified heating, it tends to be inefficient resistance heat (think electric furnaces and baseboard heating) instead of more efficient heat pumps, which is then called upon to heat homes built with little or sometimes no insulation. At very low temperatures, <a href="https://cgmf.org/blog-entry/435/REPORT-%7C-Never-Again-How-to-prevent-another-major-Texas-electricity-failure.html" target="_blank">according to one expert report on Winter Storm Uri</a>, “uninsulated homes cannot be heated effectively.” Texas only adopted a mandatory building code in 2001; last year, the state’s Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a bill that would have <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/texas/blog/2023/06/gov-abbott-vetoes-energy-efficiency-building-codes-bill" target="_blank">updated codes</a> for new buildings in the course of a fight with the state legislature over property taxes.<br/>

<p>Sony&#8217;s PlayStation 5 game console has been around since late 2020, but it&#8217;s undergone some changes since then, most notably with the launch of a new &#8220;PlayStation 5 Slim&#8221; model released last fall. Among other changes? The motherboard has gotten a lot smaller. So YouTuber Matthew Perks decided it was time to transplant that motherboard [&#8230;]</p>

## WobblyBox, a web component for wobbly boxes

date: 2024-01-16, from: Dave Rupert blog

<p>For years the latest articles list on my homepage had a neat little CSS trick where each post had wobbly “rough boxes” around them. To create the effect I used a script from <a href="http://css-houdini.rocks">css-houdini.rocks</a> aptly named <a href="https://css-houdini.rocks/rough-boxes/">Rough Boxes</a>. One minor problem, CSS Houdini paintlets aren’t – <em>and probably never will be</em> – cross-browser. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230326062701/http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">Do websites have to look the same in every browser? No.</a> But after half a decade of not seeing those wobbly boxes on iOS, I decided to abandon Houdini and draw my own quirky boxes… so I made a web component that you can use today called <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code>!</p>
<p><a class="button" href="https://github.com/davatron5000/wobbly-box">View on GitHub</a></p>
<h2>Introducing WobblyBox</h2>
<p>WobblyBox is a web component for drawing wobbly boxes around your content. Copy or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/wobbly-box">install</a> the file into your project then wrap any element you want WobblyBox around with the <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code> Custom Element.</p>
<wobbly-box>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"module"</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"wobbly-box.js"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</span>
	Any content goes here
<span class="nt">&lt;/wobbly-box&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
</wobbly-box>
<h2>Making a WobblyBox with SVG and Border-Image</h2>
<p>I wanted something as simple as the Houdini script so I started looking at porting the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>-based paintlet script but couldn’t get over the feeling that SVG might be the best fit.</p>
<p>Inside every SVG path there are some little commands in the path string. Some you may already know like <code>M</code> is for “move”, <code>Z</code> is for “terminate”, <code>L</code> is for “line”. One I didn’t know about was <code>Q</code> which creates a point on the path and bends the path towards that point in a bit of an arc.</p>
<p><code>Q</code> was a major unlocking for the effect because drawing a box in SVG is relatively easy. Here’s a 100x100 box inset 5px from the edge to account for wobble.</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;path</span> <span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">"M5,5 95,5 95,95 5,95 5,5Z"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The next step was adding in <code>Q</code> points on the path in between the points that make my box wobble…</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;path</span> <span class="na">d=</span><span class="s">"M5,5 Q50,0 95,5 Q100,50 95,95 Q50,100 5,95 Q0,50 5,5Z"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I wanted a bit of randomization in the borders, just like the original so I used JavaScript to generate random <code>Q</code> values within a few pixels positive or negative. I made some artistic choices to make it not completely random and have the top and bottom sides have the same bend while the inline sides of the box mirror each other.</p>
<p>The final step was to get this box I made to surround the content. I had an <em>image</em> that I wanted to use as a <em>border</em>… so I thought the not-often-used <code>border-image</code> property might be appropriate.</p>
<wobbly-box>
<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/01/css-border-image-property/"><code>border-image</code> is a complex but awesome property</a>. To be honest, I avoid <code>border-image</code> in my day-to-day because of its complexity, but it seemed well-suited here. It creates a 9-slice border box around an element. With a single image and some magic numbers you the images crops and repeats the image appropriately to surround the element. Back in the wild west days of the internet this was a popular technique but required a lot of extra divs. I think <code>border-radius</code> and the death of skeuomorphism ultimately depopularized the technique.</p>
</wobbly-box>
<p>Then I wrapped it all up in a web component because that seemed like the easiest delivery vehicle. I’m happy with the final effect and it’s close to what I had before except that it avoids redrawing the entire border on resize, so that’s a plus.</p>
<h2>Not a big roadmap</h2>
<p>I could have – maybe should have – used a pre-existing solution like <a href="https://wiredjs.com/">WiredJS components</a>. I like how WiredJS looks, especially for rough prototyping, but it’s probably overkill for my little boxes. I like how simple <code>&lt;wobbly-box&gt;</code> is; more cartoony and a lot more dumb.</p>
<p>If I were to make some improvements, there’s three big ticket items I’m considering…</p>
<ol>
<li>It’d be cool to control <code>--wobble</code>, <code>--thickness</code>, as well as <code>--border-color</code></li>
<li>Get rid of magic numbers</li>
<li>Sometimes there’s a little “tuck” in the corners due to how CSS’s 9-slice borders works, I’ve tried to nudge those but it’s imperfect. It’s kind of cute, so potentially worth keeping.</li>
</ol>
<p>But those improvements are not for today! I just needed this to work on Safari and Firefox.</p>

## US Pacific Territory Wants to Balance Chinese Tourism With Security Concerns

date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), a U.S. territory in the western Pacific, is the only place in the United States where Chinese nationals can enter without a visa for up to 14 days.


Security hawks in the U.S. Congress want to shut down the visa waiver program, arguing it is a backdoor for Chinese citizens to enter the United States. CNMI Governor Arnold Palacios was in Washington, D.C., last week discussing this issue with government officials. He sat down with VOA to share his views on the program and the economic challenges faced by his government. The following has been edited for length and clarity.


VOA: How important is tourism to your economy — and specifically Chinese tourism?


Palacios: Tourism is our primary industry. It is our economy, basically. The significance of Chinese tourism pre-pandemic, it was close to [nearly half] of tourists that come to the Commonwealth were from mainland China. So that's our second largest market. South Korea being the number one market. The China market is a significant market for [our] tourism industry.


VOA: When you took over as governor in January 2023, were you already aware of the visa waiver program that was giving 14-day access to Chinese nationals?


Palacios: Yes. Those visa waivers were issued in 2005. And then it was adjusted down from 45 days to 14 days. The Commonwealth and [Customs and Border Patrol] in Homeland Security cut it down to 14 days. So that's the existing visa system that we have for China.


VOA: Do you believe that this program is responsible for the volume of Chinese tourists that you get?


Palacios: Yes, I believe so.


VOA: So, members of Congress are worried that this is a backdoor to the United States, for Chinese spies to come into this country and do the U.S. harm. What is your opinion on closing the [visa waiver] program?


Palacios: In my inaugural speech, I explained and articulated why we need to wean ourselves from dependency on the Chinese market. We saw what happened in Palau. [Editor’s note: Palau's president has suggested his country has suffered severe economic consequences for keeping diplomatic ties with Taiwan, citing a sharp drop in Chinese tourists, which once accounted for some two-thirds of visitors, but has since dropped to almost zero.]


That's also a concern for people [in the] Commonwealth. We have [had Chinese] folks going from Saipan to Guam by boat, landing at Ritidian Point, which is the northernmost part of Guam ... the closest point if you travel by boat. Ironically and coincidentally, that's where our military bases are. That's where Andersen Air Force base is. And so, yeah, there's this reason to be concerned. Obviously.


VOA: Is there a middle ground to ensure that [CNMI gets] Chinese tourists and yet reassure the U.S. government that you can do it safely?


Palacios: They're reviewing what is called EVS-TAP.


[It’s] a more robust pre-screening of tourists, by Homeland Security and [Customs and Border Patrol] to screen the folks that want to come to Saipan or the Commonwealth. And so it's more robust than what we have today.


That program is under review or being drafted. We would like to review it also to make sure that that we also have a say — not to dilute the authority nor the robustness of the security part, but one of the biggest concerns that we have is we know that CBP is spread thin. It's spread thin also in specific areas. And so we have personnel assets that could be trained to assist.


VOA: Has the Department of Homeland Security been receptive to that idea?


Palacios: We haven't heard anything back regarding the status of that program or what are the rules for it, but if that program works, I think it will be OK.


VOA: Is there a revenue source to replace lost income from the Chinese tourism market?


Palacios: Not right now, so it's very significant. We've had to make drastic sacrifices in government operations and public services. People are leaving the Commonwealth because of the depressed state of the economy right now, because of the major impact of losing close to half-a-billion to a billion dollars’ worth of economic activities.


VOA: Largely because of the loss of Chinese investment and Chinese economic activity?


Palacios: Right. We are a U.S. territory, but actually most of the economic investments come from the Asian countries and the Pacific. For the past 30 years, Chinese businesses have played a significant role in economic activities in the Commonwealth, and sometimes policies that were made, you know, 9,000 miles away, sometimes they forget that they need to look at it closer, and how it impacts the American community out [here.]


At the end of the day, we will make our voices heard to our federal partners, the agencies, and hope that they understand and hopefully craft a policy that is going to meet national security standards. And at the same time, not completely kill the economy in the Commonwealth.

## If a human does it

date: 2024-01-16, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>Let’s just state the obvious here: AIs are not human. Should be obvious but apparently it’s not. I say it’s not because the amount of people who justify all sorts of shitty behavior coming from people working on AI models is astounding.</p>
<p>And the reasoning it’s always the same: it’s ok for an AI model to do X because if a human were to also do X the results would be the same. Which is a completely idiotic way of reasoning. And it’s idiotic for a few reasons.</p>
<p>First, if a human were to spend their time learning how to draw and paint in the style of 4000 different artists you’d be dead before getting halfway through that list. The same is true for any other stupid example.</p>
<p>And second, if a human were to do that we’d all condemn it pretty quickly because it goes against everything we find valuable. When a big company rips off a smaller artist everyone yells and screams. But now that AIs are doing the same that’s fine because they’re clearly not ripping off anyone, they’re just taking inspiration, like humans would do.</p>
<p>Except that if fucking Disney were to “just take inspiration” and steal designs from smaller artists we’d all be enraged, and for good reasons.</p>
<p>So please, cut the bullshit. Train your goddamn AI on whatever you want, <a href="https://nitter.net/JonLamArt/status/1741545927435784424" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">steal all the content</a>, but at least be honest and feel some shame.</p>

date: 2024-01-16, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links American education has all the downsides of standardization, none of the upsides: A common core, but no commons. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading American education has all the downsides of standardization, none of the upsides (permalink) We moved to America in 2015, in time for my kid to start third grade. Now she's a year away from graduating high school (!) and I've had a front-row seat for the US K-12 system in a district rated as one of the best in the country. There were ups and downs, but high school has been a monster. We're a decade and a half into the "common core" experiment in educational standardization. The majority of the country has now signed up to a standardized and rigid curriculum that treats overworked teachers as untrustworthy slackers who need to be disciplined by measuring their output through standard lessons and evaluations: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Core This system is rigid enough, but it gets even worse at the secondary level, especially when combined with the Advanced Placement (AP) courses, which adds another layer of inflexible benchmarks to the highest-stakes, most anxiety-provoking classes in the system: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Placement It is a system singularly lacking in grace. Ironically, this unforgiving system was sold as a way of correcting the injustice at the heart of the US public education system, which funds schools based on local taxation. That means that rich neighborhoods have better funded schools. Rather than equalizing public educational funding, the standardizers promised to ensure the quality of instruction at the worst-funded schools by measuring the educational outcomes with standard tools. But the joke's on the middle-class families who backed standardized instruction over standardized funding. Their own kids need slack as much as anyone's, and a system that promises to put the nation's kids through the same benchmarks on the same timetable is bad for everyone: https://pluralistic.net/2021/11/28/give-me-slack-2/ Undoing this is above my pay-grade. I've already got more causes to crusade on than I have time for. But there is a piece of tantalyzingly low-hanging fruit that is dangling right there, and even though I'm not gonna pick it, I can't get it out of my head, so I figured I'd write about it and hope I can lazyweb it into existence. The thing is, there's a reason that standardization takes hold in so many domains. Agreeing on a common standard enables collaboration by many entities without any need for explicit agreements or coordination. The existence of the ANSI/SAE J563 standard automobile auxiliary power outlet (AKA "car cigarette lighter") didn't just allow many manufacturers to make replacement lighter plugs. The existence of a standardized receptacle delivering standardized voltage to standardized contacts let all kinds of gadgets be designed to fit in that socket. Standards crystallize the space of all possible ways of solving a problem into a range of solutions. This inevitably has a downside, because the standardized range might not be optimal for all applications. Think of the EU's requirement for USB-C charger tips on all devices. There's a lot of reasons that manufacturers prefer different charger tips for different gadgets. Some of those reasons are bad (gouging you on replacement chargers), but some are good (unique form-factor, specific smart-charging needs). USB-C is a very flexible standard (indeed, it's so flexible that some people complain that it's not a standard at all!) but there are some applications where the optimal solution is outside its parameters. And still, I think that the standardization on USB-C is a force for good. I have drawers full of gadgets that need proprietary charger tips, and other drawers full of chargers with proprietary tips, and damned if I can make half of them match up. We've continued our pandemic lockdown tradition of my wife cutting my hair in the back yard, and just tracking the three different charger tips for the three clippers she uses is an ongoing source of frustration. I'd happily trade slightly sub-optimal charging for just being able to plug any of those clippers into the same cable I charge my headphones, phone, tablet and laptop on. The standardization of American education has produced all the downsides of standardization &#8211; a rigid, often suboptimal, one-size-fits-all system &#8211; without the benefits. With teachers across America teaching in lockstep, often from the same set texts (especially in the AP courses), there's a massive opportunity for a commons to go with the common core. For example, the AP English and History classes my kid takes use standard texts that are often centuries old and hard to puzzle out. I watched my kid struggle with texts for learning about "persuasive rhetoric" like 17th century pamphlets that inspired anti-indigenous pogroms with fictional accounts of "Indian atrocities." It's good for American schoolkids to learn about the use of these blood libels to excuse genocide, but these pamphlets are a slog. Even with glossaries in the textbooks, it's a slow, word-by-word matter to parse these out. I can't imagine anyone learning a single thing about how speech persuades people just by reading that text. But there's nothing in the standardized curriculum that prevents teachers from adding more texts to the unit. We live in an unfortunate golden age for persuasive texts that inspire terrible deeds &#8211; for example, kids could also read core Pizzagate texts and connect the guy who shot up the pizza parlor to the racists who formed a 17th century lynchmob. But teachers are incredibly time-constrained. For one thing, at least a third of the AP classroom time seems to be taken up with detailed instructions for writing stilted, stylized "essays" for the AP tests (these are terrible writing, but they're easy to grade in a standardized way). That's where standardization could actually deliver some benefits. If just one teacher could produce some supplemental materials and accompanying curriculum, the existence of standards means that every other teacher could use it. What's more, any adaptations that teachers make to that unit to make them suited to their kids would also work for the other teachers in the USA. And because the instruction is so rigidly standardized, all of these materials could be keyed to metadata that precisely identified the units they belonged to. The closest thing we have to this are "marketplaces" where teachers can sell each other their supplementary materials. As far as I can tell, the only people making real money from these marketplaces are the grifters who built them and convinced teachers to paywall the instructional materials that could otherwise form a commons. Like I said, I've got a completely overfull plate, but if I found myself at loose ends, trying to find a project to devote the rest of my life to, I'd be pitching funders on building a national, open access portal to build an educational commons. It may be a lot to expect teachers to master the intricacies of peer-based co-production tools like Git, but there's already a system like this that K-8 teachers across the country have mastered: Scratch. Scratch is a graphic programming environment for kids, and starting with 2019's Scratch 3.0, the primary way to access it is via an in-browser version that's hosted at scratch.mit.edu. Scratch's online version is basically a kid- (and teacher-)friendly version of Github. Find a project you like, make a copy in your own workspace, and then mod it to suit your own needs. The system keeps track of the lineage of different projects and makes it easy for Scratch users to find, adapt, and share their own projects. The wild popularity of this system tells us that this model for a managed digital commons for an educational audience is eminently achievable. So when students are being asked to study the rhythm of text by counting the numbers of words in the sentences of important speeches, they could supplement that very boring exercise by listening to and analyzing contemporary election speeches, or rap lyrics, or viral influencer videos. Different teachers could fork these units to swap in locally appropriate comparitors &#8211; and so could students! Students could be given extra credit for identifying additional materials that slot into existing curricular projects &#8211; Tiktok videos, new chart-topping songs, passages from hot YA novels. These, too, could go into the commons. This would enlist students in developing and thinking critically about their curriculum, whereas today, these activities are often off-limits to students. For example, my kid's math teachers don't hand back their quizzes after they're graded. The teachers only have one set of quizzes per unit, and letting the kids hold onto them would leak an answer-key for the next batch of test-takers. I can't imagine learning math this way. "You got three questions wrong but I won't let you see them" is no way to help a student focus on the right areas to improve their understanding. But there's no reason that math teachers in a commons built around the (unfortunately) rigid procession of concepts and testing couldn't generate procedural quizzes, specified with a simple programming language. These tests could even be automatically graded, and produce classroom stats on which concepts the whole class is struggling with. Each quiz would be different, but cover the same ground. When I help my kid with her homework, we often find disorganized and scattered elements of this system &#8211; a teacher might post extensive notes on teaching a specific unit. A publisher might produce a classroom guide that connects a book to specific parts of the common core. But these are scattered across the web, and they aren't keyed to the specific, standard components of common core and AP. This is a standardized system that is all costs, no benefits. It has no "architecture of participation" that lets teachers, students, parents, practitioners and even commercial publishers collaborate to produce a commons that all may share and improve upon. In an ideal world, we'd get rid of standardization in education, pay teachers well, give them the additional time they needed to prepare exciting and relevant curriculum, and fund all our schools based on need, not parents' income. But in the meanwhile, we could be making lemonade of out lemons. If we're going to have standardization, we should at least have the collaboration standards enable.

## NASA’s IXPE Helps Researchers Maximize ‘Microquasar’ Findings

The powerful gravity fields of black holes can devour whole planets’ worth of matter – often so violently that they expel streams of particles traveling near the speed of light in&#160; formations known as jets. Scientists understand that these high-speed jets can accelerate these particles, called cosmic rays, but little is definitively known about that [&#8230;]

## Why Trump ran away with Iowa

date: 2024-01-16, from: Robert Reich on Substack

Friends, The mainstream media still don&#8217;t get it. This morning&#8217;s New York Times tried to describe it and utterly failed: &#8220;Donald J. Trump&#8217;s decisive victory in Iowa revealed a new depth to the reservoir of devotion inside his party. For eight years, he has nurtured a relationship with his supporters with little precedent in politics. He validates them, he entertains them, he speaks for them and he uses them for his political and legal advantage.

## US Seizes Iranian-Made Missile Parts in Raid Near Somali Coast

date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA

JERUSALEM  — U.S. Navy SEALs seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weapons bound for Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militants in a raid last week where two service members went missing, the U.S. military said Tuesday.


The SEALs boarded a traditional dhow sailing vessel near the coast of Somalia in international waters of the Arabian Sea, seizing Iranian-made ballistic missile and cruise missile components, including propulsion, guidance, and warheads for Houthi medium range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, according to a statement from U.S. Central Command or CENTCOM, which oversees military operations in the Middle East.




The raid last Thursday marked the “first seizure of advanced Iranian-manufactured ballistic missile and cruise missile components by the U.S. Navy since November 2019,” the U.S. military said. As the SEALs were boarding the dhow in rough seas, one SEAL got knocked off by high waves. A fellow SEAL went in after him, and both remain missing.


The U.S. military detained the dhow’s 14 crew members and sank the ship after deeming it unsafe, according to CENTCOM. A United Nations resolution bans arms transfers to the Houthis. Iran has denied arming the Houthis despite evidence of the contrary.


The announcement came as Houthi militants attacked another ship traveling through international waters in the region on Tuesday. The Maltese-flagged vessel was struck by a missile and sustained some damage, though no one was wounded, according to officials.


Earlier on Tuesday, U.S. forces destroyed four Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles that were prepared to launch from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. A U.S. defense official said the ballistic missiles “presented an imminent threat to both merchant and U.S. Navy ships in the region.”


The Houthis have launched a series of attacks on commercial and military vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The militants say the attacks are due to Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip, but many of the ships targeted have no links to Israel.


The military said missile components seized during last week’s raid included parts like those used in recent Houthi attacks. Images released by the U.S. military showed components resembling motors for rockets and what looked like an anti-ship cruise missile’s turbojet engine.


The United States, Britain and a handful of other allies answered dozens of Houthi attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden with a series of powerful airstrikes on Friday and Saturday designed to severely degrade the Iranian-backed group’s capabilities.


U.S. and U.K. military leaders said the strikes hit dozens of targets ranging from command-and-control nodes, munitions depots, launching sites for drones and missiles, and production facilities.

## Challenges players face

date: 2024-01-16, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Challenges players face</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m running Arden Vul as an open table. Sessions are generally less
than 2h long. There are maybe a dozen players, maybe half of them
regulars. Arden Vul is a megadungeon. The PDF has about 1200 pages.
There are many entrances, many levels, many factions, and so on. As it
is a megadungeon, players can choose for themselves what difficulty
level they want to go for. Conversely, if there&rsquo;s a new player with a
level 1 character, they can all agree to stick to lower level
characters in order to make an adventure party that promises an
entertaining evening for all.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve started noticing that the setup introduces some player
challenges that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of.</p>

<p>If the party is powerful and the opposition is strong but clearly less
powerful, then frontal assaults &ldquo;work&rdquo; but at the same time the
session only lasts for a certain number of hours and endless fighting
killing many dozens of goblins, skeletons or cultists turns out to be somewhat boring and sap
away time. Even if the characters aren&rsquo;t hurt, time is lost.</p>

<p>This is a challenge that attacks player entertainment somewhat like
character death or long character creation, I feel.</p>

<p>You know how regular combat in the game attacks the player characters.
Some elements of it also attack player resources. This is mostly
related to character death. The result forces the player to do things
they dislike: start with a new character that has fewer levels, fewer
connections, less money, or incurs some other loss. Furthermore, if
character creation takes a very long time, then the player has to
spend the time thinking up a new build, a new concept.</p>

<p>In a way, an opposition that acts like a morass, wasting time unless
the players find another way to circumvent the problem, is a similar
attack upon the enjoyment of players. No amount of attack bonuses and
initiatives won helps against waves of undead if you can’t turn them
or hold them off some other way.</p>

<p>But there is more!</p>

<p>Since the megadungeon has a lot of doors and secrets that need keys,
and artefacts that are required for certain goals or quests, it&rsquo;s
important to note who has what, and where it was found. I don&rsquo;t want
there to be a virtual pool of plot items in a bag of holding that is
always with the group currently adventuring because even though
everybody likes it now I dread the first total party kill where I
announce that all the plot items are now lost. That&rsquo;ll be the end of
the campaign for sure.</p>

<p>I confess that I also hope on some level that knowing who has what
plot-relevant item increases interactivity as people start to realize
that for this or that to happen, they need to contact the player of
the character who&rsquo;s the owner of a particular item.</p>

<p>But yes, if players stop showing up, their characters don’t show up
and the items they have, both magic items they found and plot items
they hold, effectively disappear from the game.</p>

<p>So this is an additional player challenge of their organisational skills.
Can they keep track of the items? Can they organise hand-overs?</p>

<p>Arden Vul is also a megadungeon where hints can be found in the
hundreds of rumours, wall scribbles, frescos, mosaics, and so on. But
if nobody collects and studies them, the information is effectively
lost. If one player keeps notes on paper, or in their Google Docs,
that information is effectively lost to the others.</p>

<p>I know that as a player in the Barrowmaze I’m also not a great
organiser of rumours heard and information gathered. There is space
for improvement!</p>

<p>So this is another player challenge: how to best share information.
Can they build a knowledge repository somewhere, that helps
them distribute information and collect hypothesises and conclusions?</p>

<p>The same is true about the ruins explored, entrances found, and perhaps
more importantly, the places where no entrances were found but also
they left before making absolutely sure. In a few sessions, players
don&rsquo;t remember where they&rsquo;ve been and they don&rsquo;t remember whether
an area was fully explored. This duplicates effort and lost opportunities.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a sort of price to pay for the freedom players have
in this kind of setup.</p>

So if you have an account on <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>, the original system, which is still running of course, you could now reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be fully updated, but you'll be rewarded by a higher performance user experience. Thanks to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and company for giving us access to this phenomenal resource. I still haven't gotten used to designing with the assumption that my system can scale as far as it seems it can.

## How pizza can explain proposed bank capital regulation

date: 2024-01-16, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Today is the deadline for comments on a proposed rule to increase capital requirements for large banks. It can be useful to think of the money a bank uses to fund its business as a pizza — some slices are equity, others are debt, and others are unknowns. We&#8217;ll dish up that analogy. Sticking with the food theme: Mexican food is increasingly popular with young Americans, and one in 10 eateries serves it.</p>

## Climate Change Is Making CEOs Nervous

date: 2024-01-16, from: Heatmap News

Trump’s Iowa speeches offer preview of 2024 climate attack lines</h3><p><strong></strong>Former President Donald Trump handily won the Republican Iowa caucus on Monday night, and his speeches at the event were sprinkled with anti-climate lines we’re likely to hear more of in his 2024 presidential campaign, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e5e7af162d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes <em>Heatmap</em>’s Jeva Lange</a>. In his victory speech, Trump made a jab about electric vehicle range anxiety, and promised to do more “drilling” if he gets the White House back. Earlier in the evening he told would-be voters that “I stood up for ethanol like nobody has ever stood up for it” – a dig at Biden’s climate agenda, which has aimed to limit liquid fuel in vehicles, a sensitive issue for Iowa voters during their primary season. On Sunday a group of young climate protesters disrupted one of Trump’s rallies, calling him a “climate criminal.” Trump told them to “go home to mommy.”<br/><br/>This was the coldest caucus in Iowa’s history thanks to a weather system that dragged temperatures below freezing for most of the country. As Lange notes: “Scientists say the arctic blast is exactly the kind of extreme event we can expect more of in a climate-changed world.”</p><h3>2.

A group of 27 investors – including Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi – are backing an independent resolution filed by activist group Follow This demanding the company do more to slash its greenhouse gas emissions. The resolution calls on Shell to better align its pollution targets with the Paris Agreement and focuses specifically on the emissions customers generate when they use Shell’s products, known as Scope 3 emissions. The company called the resolution “unrealistic and simplistic” and insisted its targets already align with the Paris Agreement. This isn’t Follow This’ first resolution aimed at Shell, but this one appears to have the most momentum: Its investor-backers own about 5% of Shell’s shares. Support for the resolution is expected to grow ahead of a vote at the company’s annual general meeting in May, <em>The Guardian</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0ad195a748&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.</p><h3>4.

About 45% of the respondents are concerned about their current business models, up from 39% on last year’s survey. Among their top anxieties are artificial intelligence and – you guessed it – climate change. Nearly one-third of CEOs say they expect climate change to “alter the way they create, deliver, and capture value over the next three years.” About two-thirds of respondents say their firms are improving their energy efficiency, but support is lacking for other climate-related company initiatives:</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

## Trump’s Climate Sneak Peek in Iowa

date: 2024-01-16, from: Heatmap News

But in his freewheeling, name-dropping, teleprompter-free victory speech in Des Moines, Trump showed uncharacteristic restraint in avoiding the low-hanging comedic fruit. </p><p>Perhaps it was because Trump’s mind was on other things: his civil damages trial that begins in New York City <a href="https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1747072511718613247?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Tuesday</a>, say. Or maybe, as I suspect, it was part of a larger trend that has come to shape Trump’s third presidential campaign — that he’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">honing his attacks on climate science and the energy transition</a> for <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self">the 2024 race</a>.</p><p>Certainly, Trump’s Iowa speech featured some of his favorite one-liners from the campaign trail. “He comes all the way from Missouri, which isn’t that far,” Trump said at one point in an apparent reference to Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, one of numerous surrogates who’d helped with a ground game Trump <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/08/2024/donald-trump-isnt-winning-iowa-the-usual-way" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hadn’t seemed terribly interested in</a> trying himself. “Couldn’t drive an electric car that far, though,” Trump added to laughs — a variation of a jab about range anxiety that he’s been trotting out at his rallies. (Des Moines to the Missouri border is 76 miles, which even <a href="https://www.topspeed.com/electric-cars-with-lowest-range/#mazda-mx-30-100-miles" target="_blank">the least efficient EVs</a> could make without stopping; <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">most new EVs on the market</a> could also make it to the capital, Jefferson City — 255 miles away — on a single charge).</p><p>Trump also made enthusiastic references to “drilling,” promising we’ll do a whole lot of it if he gets the White House back. “We have to stop the invasion, we have to bring down the energy — you know, I say all the time, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation anywhere in the world — and we have to stop the crime and we have to help rebuild our cities,” Trump went on, distracted from <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">his usual script</a>, which typically involves an additional story about President Biden “begging” Venezuela for oil.</p><p>Trump had also spoken in specifics earlier in the evening when he’d told would-be voters that “I stood up for ethanol like nobody has ever stood up for it” — another dig at Biden’s climate agenda, which has aimed to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">limit liquid fuel in vehicles</a>, a <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2022/02/13/iowa-ethanol-economy-lawmakers-ignore-warning-signs-biofuels/6701662001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sensitive issue for Iowa voters</a> during their primary season.</p><p>But if Americans could agree on anything this week, it’s that it’s cold. Between the Iowa caucuses and Tuesday night, more than three-quarters of the country will experience <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/14/weather/south-snow-storm-ice-forecast-climate/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temperatures below freezing</a> — weather that will shatter over 200 winter temperature records, all told. And while that might lend itself to <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1746673199989874833?s=20" target="_blank">unoriginal jokes</a> among conservatives, scientists say the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whats-behind-the-arctic-blast-plunging-into-the-u-s/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arctic blast</a> is exactly the kind of extreme event we can expect more of in a climate-changed world.</p><p>On Sunday, Trump mocked any alarm that might instill in people — <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">including his own supporters</a> — by telling a group of climate protesters that interrupted his rally to “go home to mommy. Your mommy’s waiting.”</p><p>But <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/climate-change-where-is-safe" style="" target="_self">nowhere is safe</a>, and there are a long 11 months and three seasons to go before the next election. Still, some things can grimly be assumed to be forgone: Trump will almost certainly be the Republican candidate. And whatever comes next, it will be worse.</p>

## Most Iowa Republican Caucus-goers Say Trump Fit to be President if Convicted

date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Most Republicans at Iowa's caucus said they felt Donald Trump would be fit for the White House even if he were convicted of a crime, an entrance poll showed on Monday, underscoring the stronghold the former president has on the Republican Party.


About two-thirds of caucus-goers also said they did not believe Democratic President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, according to the poll.


Following are highlights from the Edison Research poll based on interviews with 1,628 Iowa Republicans.



	66% said they did not think Biden legitimately won the presidency in 2020.
	65% said they decided who to support in the presidential nomination contest before this month.
	65% said Trump would still be fit to be president if he were convicted of a crime. 31% said he would be unfit if convicted.
	61% said they favor a federal law that would ban abortions nationwide.
	53% of white caucus-goers who considered themselves evangelical or born-again Christians supported Trump, while 27% backed DeSantis.
	46% of voters said they considered themselves part of the MAGA movement, a reference to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. 50% said they were not part of that movement.
	Trump led Haley and DeSantis by double digits among men and women alike. But among college graduates Trump was preferred by about 37% of caucus-goers, compared to 28% for Haley and 26% for DeSantis.
	38% percent of caucus-goers said the economy was the issue that mattered most in deciding who to vote for on Monday, compared to 34% who cited immigration, while the rest cited foreign policy or abortion.
	14% said the most important quality a Republican presidential nominee should have is the ability to beat Biden, compared to 41% who said shared values mattered most.


Edison Research conducted the poll on behalf of the National Election Pool, a consortium of news organizations including Reuters.

## US: Nauru’s Decision to Break with Taiwan ‘Disappointing’

date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States said Monday that the government of Nauru’s severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan is “disappointing,” despite it being a sovereign decision.


The Pacific Island nation announced its decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China shortly after Taiwan’s presidential and legislative elections.


“Taiwan is a reliable, like-minded, and democratic partner. The PRC often makes promises in exchange for diplomatic relations that ultimately remain unfulfilled,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement late Monday.  He was referring to People’s Republic of China.


Miller added: “We encourage all countries to expand engagement with Taiwan and to continue to support democracy, good governance, transparency, and adherence to the rule of law.”


The Republic of Nauru “will no longer recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China’s territory,” said the Nauru government in an official statement on Monday.  


In Beijing, Chinese officials praised the move.


“China appreciates and welcomes the decision of the government of the Republic of Nauru,” said Mao Ning who is a spokesperson of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.


“The Nauru government’s decision of reestablishing diplomatic ties with China once again shows that the one-China principle is where global opinion trends” are, said Mao.  


She repeated China’s assertion that “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory” during a briefing Monday.


Implications to the U.S. policy towards the Pacific Islands


Nauru is one of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum, or PIF, the premier political and economic policy-making body for the region. It comprises 18 member states, with Australia and New Zealand being the largest economies in the bloc. Neither the United States nor China is a full member.


Last September, U.S. President Joe Biden hosted leaders from this Pacific Islands bloc at a two-day summit in Washington, amid rising U.S. concerns about China’s growing military and economic influence in the region.




 


The shift in Nauru’s position means the next Pacific Islands Forum secretary general will be from a country that recognizes the government in Beijing, rather than the government in Taipei.


Some analysts believe Nauru’s move could make it more challenging for the PIF to resist overtures from China.


Last November, former Nauru President Baron Waqa was selected as the next PIF Secretary General, at a time when Nauru still maintained diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Waqa has reportedly resisted China’s pressure in the past. It remains to be seen whether he will continue as the PIF Secretary General.


According to Cleo Paskal, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, or FDD, Chinese offers to Nauru have been present for years, and the specifics of this deal were likely finalized before the Taiwan elections.


She suggested that Beijing might have delayed the announcement until after the Taiwan elections to “reinforce” the PRC’s narrative.


"U.S. policy in the Pacific Islands is not shining at the moment,” Paskal told VOA.


“Nauru has been asking for help with things like developing its port and protecting its waters for years - things that would help regional security as well.  The longer they wait, the more room for PRC operatives to say 'they aren't coming, you should cut the deal in front of you now, with us'.  The window for U.S. relevance is closing.”


UN resolution 2758


Monday, the State Department said the United States will continue to support Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the international community and deepen economic ties, consistent with Washington’s longstanding One China policy.


The U.S. does not take a position on Taiwan's sovereignty. Under Washington's One China policy, the U.S. acknowledges Beijing's claims of sovereignty over Taiwan but does not endorse them.


Washington and Taipei have held regular consultations to explore Taiwan’s participation in the United Nations system and other international forums, to address a range of global challenges, including public health, aviation safety and climate change.


In Beijing, Chinese spokesperson Mao Ning said, “There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory,” citing United Nations resolution 2758. 


On October 25, 1971, the U.N. General Assembly passed U.N. Resolution 2758, which replaced the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan’s formal name) with the People's Republic of China (PRC) as a permanent member of the Security Council in the United Nations.


While the resolution stated the representatives of the PRC government were the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, it neither determined Taiwan’s status nor said Taiwan was part of China.


The PRC's efforts to rewrite Taiwan's status at the United Nations intensified during the 1990s and early 2000s, coinciding with the island's democratization, according to an analysis by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

## 'Succession' Dominates Drama Emmys, 'The Bear' Claims Comedy, Brunson Makes History

date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — “Succession” secured its legacy with its third best drama series award, “The Bear” feasted as the night's top comedy, and the two shows about squabbling families dominated the acting awards at Monday night's Emmys.


Historic wins also came for Quinta Brunson of “Abbot Elementary" and Steven Yeun and Ali Wong of “Beef" at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day ceremony that was finally held four months late after a turbulent year of strikes in Hollywood.


“Succession,” the HBO saga of the dysfunctional generations of a maladjusted media empire, won the top prize for its fourth and final season. It also won best actress in a drama for Sarah Snook and best actor in a drama for Kieran Culkin.


“We all put our all into it and the bar was set so high,” Snook said.


“The Bear,” the FX dramedy about a contentious family and a struggling restaurant at the center of the life of a talented chef, won best comedy series for its first season. It also made a meal of its acting categories, with Jeremy Allen White winning best actor in a comedy, best supporting actress in a comedy for Ayo Edebiri winning best supporting actress, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach taking best supporting actor. All three were first-time nominees.




“This is a show about family and found family and real family,” Edebiri said from the stage as she accepted the first trophy of the night at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.


Instead of the usual producer speeches, Matty Matheson, a real-life elite chef who plays a kitchen newbie and repairman on “The Bear,” spoke for the show near the end of the Fox telecast.


“I just love restaurants so much, the good and the bad, we’re broken inside,” Matheson said before getting a long kiss on the mouth from Moss-Bachrach.


Brunson won best actress in a comedy for the show she created, ABC's “Abbott Elementary," becoming the first Black woman to win the award in more than 40 years and the first from a network show to win it in more than a decade.


“I am so happy to be able to live my dream and act out comedy,” Brunson said during her acceptance on the Fox telecast, fighting back tears. The writer-actor was among the stars with standout looks on the Emmys' silver carpet.


“Succession" won six Emmys overall including best supporting actor in a drama for Matthew Macfadyen and best writing in a drama for show creator Jesse Armstrong. The only drama acting category it didn't win was supporting actress, taken for the second time by Jennifer Coolidge of “The White Lotus.”


“The Bear” won in every category it was nominated for Monday night, and along with the four it had won previously at the Creative Arts Emmys, took 10 overall, the most of any show.


Landmark wins on TV's big night


“Beef” won best limited series, while Steven Yeun and Ali Wong became the first Asian Americans to win in their categories – Yeun for best actor in a limited series and Wong for best actress. Creator Lee Sung won Emmys for writing and directing. It had eight Emmys overall after three wins at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmy Awards.


Brunson had won a writing Emmy for “Abbott Elementary,” her mockumentary about a predominantly Black and chronically underfunded grade school in Philadelphia, but this is her first for acting. Isabel Sanford of “The Jeffersons” was the only previous Black woman to win the category in 1981.


The first hour of the show held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day saw three Black women win major awards: Brunson, Edebiri and Niecy Nash-Betts, who won best supporting actress in a limited series for “Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story."


On the Netflix show, Nash-Betts played a neighbor of the serial killer whose complaints to authorities about his behavior go unheeded.


"I accept this award on behalf of every Black and brown woman who has gone unheard and over-policed," she said.


“Everybody having fun at the chocolate Emmys tonight?” host Anthony Anderson said during the show. “We are killing it tonight! ... This is like MLK Day and Juneteenth all rolled up in one!”


The tweaked awards calendar made for some oddities. Edebiri and White won their Emmy for the show’s first season eight days after after winning Golden Globes for the second season.


Baby talk amid ‘succession’ wins


Culkin outshined the older brother and the father to win the final lead actor Emmy for “Succession.”


He had twice been nominated for best supporting actor for “Succession” without a win. But in the final season, in which his character Roman Roy goes from sideline wisecracker to emotional disaster at the center of the show’s drama, he was put in the lead category and won over castmates Brian Cox, who played his father, and Jeremy Strong, who played his older brother.


He then shifted to his own family, getting big laughs during his speech when he told his wife Jazz Charton that their two young kids weren't enough. “I want more," he said. “You said if I won, we could talk about it.”


Snook took her first Emmy in three nominations for “Succession" and her fictional husband Macfadyen won the second Emmy of his career for playing Tom Wambsgans, the son-in-law that began the HBO series as a hanger-on and ended it as the closest thing it had to a victor on “Succession."


Many tears, and one concerned mother


Emotions ran high from the start of the ceremony. Edebiri and Brunson were both quick to cry as they took the stage, and the first presenter, Christina Applegate, who said in 2021 that she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, got a standing ovation as she came out using a cane, helped by Anderson. She struggled to get through the nominees and winner with the tears in her eyes.


Anderson told the nominees at the beginning of the night that instead of having their speeches cut off by music, his mother, actor Doris Hancox, sitting in the audience, would tell them when it was time to move on. But she more often shouted down her son in the running gag.


Older shows return to spotlight


Honoring TV history was the theme at the 75th Emmys. Anderson opened the show on a “Mr. Rogers” set and performed TV theme songs including “Good Times,” and several cast reunions were spread throughout the show.


Cast members including Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell from “Martin," Ted Danson and Rhea Perlman from “Cheers,” and Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers from “All in The Family,” performed short bits from recreations of their sitcom sets before presenting awards.


Tina Fey and Amy Poehler reunited to present an award in the form of their 2001-2005 “Weekend Update" team-up from “Saturday Night Live."


“We’ve reached the stage in life where we’ll only present awards sitting down,” Fey said.


One notable appearance came from Katherine Heigl, who joined Ellen Pompeo and other former “Grey's Anatomy” cast mates on a hospital room set after leaving the show, now about to start its 20th season, on not the best terms in 2010.


“Yes, there have been changes over the years,” Heigl said with a wry smile, “But the one constant is the amazing fanbase.”

## Understanding the Raspberry Pi Pico’s Memory Layout

## I used Netscape Composer in 2024

date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News

Netscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a kid, I created my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it online, but I proudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them off on family members&#8217; and friends&#8217; computers. This is likely how I got the understanding that websites are just made of files. Using Netscape Composer also taught me basic web vocabulary, such as &#8220;page&#8221; and &#8220;hyperlink&#8221;. Of course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since then. I was curious to try out that dated software again and see what its limitations were, and what the code it produces looks like from a 2024 perspective. The first thing I needed was a goal. I decided to try and reproduce the home page of my personal website as closely as the application allowed it. That seemed like a sensible aim as my website has a rather minimalistic design, with very little that should be completely out of reach for an antiquated tool. ↫ Pier-Luc Brault What a fun exercise.

## Google shamelessly tries to rebrand gambling as “real-money gaming”

date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News

As a platform, we strive to help developers responsibly build new businesses and reach wider audiences across a variety of content types and genres. In response to strong demand, in 2021 we began onboarding a wider range of real-money gaming (RMG) apps in markets with pre-existing licensing frameworks. Since then, this app category has continued to flourish with developers creating new RMG experiences for mobile. ↫ Karan Gambhir, director of &#8220;Global Trust and Safety Partnerships&#8221; at Google &#8220;Real-money gaming&#8221; is the most obvious and blatant rebranding of &#8220;gambling&#8221; I have ever seen. Google, this is gambling. You&#8217;re making it easier for scumbags to target the poor and swindle them out of the little money they have. This is a shameless attempt at increasing Google&#8217;s revenue by making it easier to scam people into gambling. Everything about this post &#8211; and (mobile) gambling &#8211; is disgusting.

## Menendez's Wife Asks for Separate Trial From Husband

date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA

washington — The wife of U.S. Senator Bob Menendez on Monday sought to sever the government's corruption case against her from that of her husband, according to a court document. 


In the document, Nadine Menendez's lawyers said a joint trial would prejudice her right to defend herself at a fair trial. They added that a joint trial would force the married defendants to make a Hobson's choice "as exercising their right to testify in their own defense may necessitate waiving their privilege against providing testimony adverse to their spouse." 


"Ms. Menendez's interests in both maintaining the confidentiality of her privileged marital communications and exercising her spousal testimonial privilege without sacrificing her ability to testify in her own defense collectively support a finding of a 'serious risk' that a joint trial will compromise her 'specific trial rights,' " the lawyers said. 


The pair pleaded not guilty in October after they were charged with taking bribes from three New Jersey businessmen. 


In charging the senator last September, prosecutors said investigators had found gold bars and envelopes stuffed with cash inside jackets in the New Jersey Democrat's apartment. 


They also said businessman Wael Hana had arranged meetings between Menendez and Egyptian officials, who pressed the senator to sign off on military aid. 


In return, Hana put Menendez's wife on the payroll of a company he controlled, prosecutors said. 


Earlier this month, prosecutors accused Menendez of helping a New Jersey businessman seek an investment from a Qatari company with ties to the Middle Eastern country's government. 


The latest allegations, which accused him of acting as a foreign agent, add pressure on the embattled senator, who has resisted calls to resign from members of his own party.
