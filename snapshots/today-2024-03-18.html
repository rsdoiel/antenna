<p>Blogroll fix. The blogroll was grabbing the up and down-arrow and
Return for keyboard navigation, one of my favorite blogroll features.
Put the cursor where you want, and arrow through the list. Press Return
to expand, and again to collapse. Then down-arrow and repeat. But
sometimes you want to use these keys for other functions. So I changed
it so you have to click the blogroll to set the focus. Its border turns
blueish, and the keys work as described. Press the Tab key or click
outside the blogroll to take the focus off the blogroll.</p>

working with developers again, thank goodness. I once thought I could
make server products or toolkits for people I called “poets” – motivated
writers. I have given up on that, at least for the time-being. I think a
properly motivated intelligent writer could get developer-like results,
I’ve seen it happen (Brent Simmons, Dan MacTough). They make really good
developers because they understand the user perspective so well, it
still lives inside them. The problem seems to be motivation, and a poet
knowing that they need to be super-motivated and have the time, to get
<i>anything</i> technical to work. If they knew what was required, my
2024 theory goes, and had studied for it, the way they studied for their
degree, they could not only be successful, but they could contribute to
the developer process. Analogously, we all have to learn a little
cooking just to get through life, but only a few people are chefs.

Electroconvulsive therapy is highly effective in treating major
depressive disorder, but no one knows why it works. New research
suggests it may restore balance between excitation and inhibition in the
brain.

<strong></strong>The Environmental Protection Agency this week is
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=fb2f79c179&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expected</a>
to officially announce new tailpipe emissions rules that will
dramatically reshape the transportation sector over the coming years. If
carmakers are to meet the EPA’s new rules, electric vehicles would need
to make up a much larger share of car and light truck sales by 2030 than
they do now. Last year EVs accounted for about one-tenth of sales. The
end goal is to see that rise to two-thirds by 2032, but the nearer-term
targets have shifted in response to anger and pressure from carmakers
and the United Auto Workers union who argued EVs remain too costly and
that the transition should be more gradual. Transportation is America’s
biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and the Biden administration
sees reducing this pollution as instrumental to the U.S. fulfilling its
Paris Agreement commitment of cutting emissions in half by 2030.

but “climate concerns are reflected in the conference sessions on carbon
sequestration technology and hydrogen fuels, which have become two of
the oil industry’s favorite means of addressing global warming.” Natural
gas – and President Biden’s pause on new LNG export projects – will be
high on the agenda. The <em>Houston Chronicle</em>

On Wednesday of last week ocean temperatures set a new all-time high at
21.2 degrees celsius, or 70.16 degrees Fahrenheit. “This exceptional
heat has bleak implications,” the <em>FT</em> said. Some ecosystems,
including coral reefs, are already showing signs of devastation. And
scientists are increasingly worried about a strong upcoming Atlantic
hurricane season. On a macro level, there’s “a lot of concern” that a
key ocean current conveyor belt known as the Atlantic Meridional
Overturning Circulation (AMOC) could slow due to an influx of fresh
meltwater, “with unknown consequences for habitable conditions on
Earth.”

country is rapidly expanding its renewable capacity: Last year it
installed more new solar panels than the total built by any other
country, and its wind installation climbed, as well. Solar installations
are expected to rise another 7% this year. But the grid has struggled to
keep up. The new $3.9 billion transmission project will serve three
provinces, be fed by solar and wind power, and store energy in mountain
reservoirs, <em>Bloomberg</em>

<h2 id="why-d.c.-is-hot-for-geothermal">Why D.C. Is Hot for
Geothermal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-18, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc1MTEyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMDM5OTA5OX0.GSlGcrw892WIgxWPa7hPmkxp52tECKkyi8CvHNyBmFc/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The political coalition that has been assembled in support of advanced
geothermal is bipartisan, but uni-regional: If you drew a broad strip
from Las Vegas to Albuquerque and then dragged it north to the Canadian
border, you would envelop Utah and Idaho (not to mention Arizona and big
chunks of Wyoming and Montana). This stretch of
<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/john-mcphee" target="_blank">John
McPhee</a> country includes some of biggest swaths of federal land — and
some of the hottest rocks beneath it — in the country.
</p>
<p>
And so Senators Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Catherine Cortez Masto of
Nevada, Mike Lee of Utah, and James Risch of Idaho have found themselves
crossing party lines, working together on a bill to encourage more
production of geothermal energy, which the unique contours of this area
make (potentially) especially abundant.
</p>
<p>
The Geothermal Energy Optimization Act, introduced last week, is a kind
of test case for how a bipartisan energy policy could work. It combines
deregulation with support for a non-carbon energy resource that leans
heavily on expertise in the oil and gas industry while also not
committing to any new spending.
</p>
<p>
But the bill isn’t just a victory for bipartisanship, it’s also a
victory of geology. Thanks to
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/para/learn/nature/stretching-of-the-basin-and-range-and-lifting-of-the-colorado-plateau.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tens
of millions of years</a> of plates sliding beneath each other and
mountains collapsing, “you have a relatively thin crust before you get
to that heat,” as Ben Serrurier, head of government affairs at Fervo,
the enhanced geothermal startup, told me. (Fervo has operations in both
<a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/google-fervo-geothermal-energy-partnership/#geothermalenergy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Nevada</a>
and<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/fervo-energy-tim-latimer-drilling-costs" target="_self">
Utah</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The bill would establish a “categorical exclusion” from environmental
reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act for some geothermal
activity, including exploration, i.e. the drilling of wells to see
whether a particular site is suitable for a geothermal project.
</p>
<p>
The law would both expand a provision of the Energy Policy Act of 2005,
which established a categorical exclusion for some oil and gas projects,
and write up a new one especially for geothermal. The bill would also
require the Bureau of Land Management to have regular geothermal lease
sales.
</p>
<p>
The 2005 bill was written at a time when an oil-industry-friendly White
House wanted to make the country more energy self-sufficient, and
deregulation oil and gas activities was an obvious way to do so. The GEO
Act comes during another period of intense interest in energy policy,
but not one in which the paramount goal is smoothing away obstacles to
hydrocarbon extraction. Today, the United States is the biggest oil and
gas producer in the world (thanks to hydraulic fracturing and horizontal
drilling, technology that’s used in “enhanced” geothermal energy
projects) and both the White House and the Democratic Party are friendly
to non-carbon energy.
</p>
<p>
But while existing tax credits have been successful in boosting wind and
solar deployment, there is still need for so-called
“<a href="https://www.catf.us/2023/05/we-need-clean-firm-electricity-decarbonized-energy-system/" target="_blank">clean
firm</a>” technologies, energy resources that can provide power at all
hours of the day, no matter the weather.<br/>
</p>
<p>
By speeding up and adding some certainty to the permitting process, the
bill’s provisions would “enable us to raise capital and move forward
with more projects on a faster timeline,” explained Serrurier. “We
already face challenges trying to raise project finance,” he said. “Then
we show them the permitting timeline.”
</p>
<p>
The bill would also create a “strike team” within the BLM that could
advise field offices and staff on how to process and deal with
geothermal permits. “The agency needs to implement it — and care about
implementing — for it to work out well,” Aidan Mackenzie, a fellow at
the Institute for Progress, told me.
</p>
<p>
The bill is a small-bore example of the biggest yawning gap in
post-Inflation Reduction Act energy policy:
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self">permitting
reform</a>. While it’s often discussed in the context of building new
transmission lines necessary to connect IRA-subsidized clean energy
projects to energy consumers, permitting reform would also be a boon to
emerging energy resources like geothermal.
</p>
<p>
In an emailed statement, Senator Heinrich touted New Mexico’s geothermal
progress. “Accelerating the adoption of geothermal energy nationwide is
key to unlock a clean energy independent future, lower costs for working
Americans, and create more high-quality jobs that New Mexicans can build
their families around,” he said.
</p>
<p>
In theory, at least, the GEO Act seems like something that could
actually pass in this Congress. After all, Republicans tend to support
removing regulatory fetters from energy projects, especially energy
projects involving drilling, and Republicans in the Mountain West
really, really like telling the BLM not to raise too many hackles when
it comes to drilling.
</p>
<p>
“Geothermal has been kinda bipartisan for a while,” Mackenzie said.
“Bipartisan in the sense that everyone kinda supports it and no one is
willing to take it along.” But that may be starting to change. “Recent
news has made it feel a bit more real to folks,” he said. “Like,
<em>it’s a real industry that could be in our state</em>.”

Charter Flight With US Citizens Fleeing Haiti Lands in Miami</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-18, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MIAMI — A charter flight carrying dozens of U.S. citizens fleeing
spiraling gang violence in Haiti landed Sunday in Miami, U.S. State
Department officials said.</p>
<p>More than 30 U.S. citizens were on the government-chartered flight,
officials said in a statement. It arrived in the Miami International
Airport after the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince earlier this month
urged U.S. citizens to leave “as soon as possible” as chaos grips
Haiti.</p>
<p>Haiti’s main airport in Port-au-Prince remains closed following gang
attacks that have raged through Haiti for weeks, pushing many people to
the brink of famine. Government and aid agencies this weekend reported
looting of aid supplies as the situation worsened.</p>
<p>The State Department announced Saturday that it would offer limited
charter flights for American citizens from the less chaotic northern
city of Cap-Haïtien.</p>
<p>Officials said they could not provide ground transportation to
Cap-Haïtien and that U.S. citizens should consider the charter flights
“only if you think you can reach Cap-Haïtien airport safely.”</p>
<p>“We encourage U.S. citizens still in Haiti who seek to depart to
contact the Department of State using the crisis intake form on our
website if they have not already done so,” the agency said.</p>
<p>People taking the U.S. government-coordinated flights must sign a
promissory bill agreeing to reimburse the government.</p>
<p>The State Department said government officials in Miami were helping
the newly arrived evacuees to determine their next steps.</p>
<p>The U.S. military last week flew in additional forces to bolster
security at the U.S. Embassy, which is in a neighborhood largely
controlled by gangs.</p>

<h2 id="trapped-in-the-iron-age">
Trapped in the Iron Age
</h2>
<p>
In 1836, Danish antiquarian and curator Christian Jürgensen Thomsen
distinguished three prehistorical eras based on the dominant materials
used for weapons and cutting implements: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age,
and the Iron
Age.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
Thomsen’s classification refers to the past, but according to his
criteria, we have never evolved beyond the Iron Age. Even in the 21st
century, iron remains the dominant material, not just for weapons and
cutting implements but for about every modern technology.
</p>
<p>
We now use most iron in the form of steel. However, according to
Thomsen’s criteria, we cannot speak of a “Steel Age.” First, steel is
merely an alloy of iron (&gt;98%) and carbon (&lt;2%). Second, humans
have been producing steel since the beginning of the Iron Age. That is a
little-known fact in the Western world, where steel production only took
off in the nineteenth century with fossil fuels. However, Asian and
African metallurgists developed high-quality steels much earlier, and
this knowledge eventually allowed Europeans to do the same – on a much
larger
scale.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
By 2021, the global iron and steel output reached 1,950 million tonnes
(Mt). That is 22 times larger than the combined aluminum and copper
output (88 Mt). The global iron and steel output corresponds to five
times the global plastics output (391 Mt) and dwarfs the worldwide
production of silicon (8.5 Mt) and lithium (0.1
Mt).<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>
Steel is the fundamental material of industrial societies. Without
plastics, lithium, or silicon, we would still be in an industrial
society. Without iron and steel, we would be thrown back 3,000 years
into the Bronze Age.
</p>
<h2 id="where-is-all-that-steel">
Where is all that steel?
</h2>
<p>
The massive presence of steel in industrial society is not so
obvious.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
At home, we find several steel appliances such as the refrigerator,
washing machine, water boiler, bathtub, and cooking, heating, and
cooling appliances. However, only 2-3% of total steel production ends up
in domestic
appliances.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>
Outdoors, there’s a lot of steel in the form of vehicles. These are
especially passenger cars that use around 10% of all steel globally (20%
in rich countries). Busses, trucks, trains, and ships add another 4-5%.
Altogether that is still less than 20% of the global steel output.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Most steel is embedded in other materials, located underground, or far
away from residential areas.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Most steel is embedded in other materials, located underground, or far
away from residential areas. More than half of global steel production
goes into construction, which includes buildings (residential,
commercial, industrial) and infrastructures (bridges, tunnels, harbors,
canals, runways, oil rigs, refineries, pipelines, power plants,
transmission lines, railways, subways, and so on). Much of that steel is
embedded in concrete. Reinforced concrete is the world’s primary
building material, and concrete is the only material that can match the
output of steel (1,819 Mt in 2021).
</p>
<p>
Roughly 15% of global steel production serves to make machinery,
including machine tools, industrial equipment, electrical hardware, and
construction, mining, and farming machines. Even products made of other
materials – such as other metals, plastics, and wood – are shaped by
steel
tools.<sup id="fnref1:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
The final 15% of steel production ends up in a variety of objects, from
screws over food packaging to furniture and shipping
containers.<sup id="fnref1:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>

<h2 id="the-environmental-footprint-of-the-steel-industry">
The environmental footprint of the steel industry
</h2>
<p>
Steel is often presented as one of the most sustainable materials.
Unlike plastics, steel can be recycled without any loss in quality. The
steel industry has made great advances in energy efficiency, more so
than many other industries. Making one ton of crude steel now requires
roughly 20 gigajoules (GJ) of primary energy on average – three times
less than in
1950.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>
This compares very favorably to other materials such as aluminum (175
GJ/t), plastics (80-120 GJ/t), or copper (45
GJ/t).<sup id="fnref2:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Unlike plastics, steel is a biodegradable
material.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>
Finally, iron ore is not in short supply. It makes up 5 percent of the
Earth’s crust and is fourth in abundance among the
elements.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>
For comparison, copper only makes up
0.01%.<sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
However, despite all these advantages, the global iron and steel
industry consumes more energy and produces more carbon emissions than
any other industry. The total primary energy use of crude steel
production was 39 exajoules (EJ) in 2021, which corresponds to 7% of all
energy used worldwide in that year (595 EJ). The greenhouse gas
emissions are even higher because around 75% of energy use comes from
coal – the fuel with the highest carbon emissions. In 2021, the iron and
steel industry produced 3.3 Gt of carbon emissions, roughly 9% of global
emissions (36.3
Gt).<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>
The concrete industry follows closely with 8% of global emissions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The iron and steel industry consumes more energy and produces more
carbon emissions than any other industry.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The estimates above come from the <em>World Steel Association</em> and
the <em>International Energy Agency</em>. These data are available for
all metals and have been documented over a long period, allowing for
historical comparisons. However, they only refer to the smelting of the
metal. They do not include the energy use and carbon emissions for
mining and transporting iron ore, coal, limestone, scrap, and steel
products. Nor do they include the energy and emissions for coke
production and ore preparation – all essential to the steel production
process.<sup id="fnref3:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Scientific studies that have set wider boundaries for the iron and steel
industry conclude that the energy cost of steel production increases by
50% to
100%.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup>
One report concludes that the methane emissions from metallurgical coal
mining alone could increase emissions by 27%. Another study estimates
that seaborne transport of iron ore and steel adds 10-15% extra
emissions.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>
Iron and steel production also create other environmental problems, such
as high water use, solid waste production, and significant air and water
pollution.
</p>
<p>
The carbon footprint of the iron and steel industry is incompatible with
current ambitions to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2050, even less
so because steel production is very likely to expand further. Steel
production grew tenfold since 1950 and doubled between 2000 and 2020,
growing faster than many researchers had
predicted.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup>
Furthermore, efficiency gains have decreased, and there is a scientific
consensus that current technologies have reached their thermodynamic
limits.<sup id="fnref4:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup>
During the last two decades, the average energy use for the production
of 1 ton of steel has remained around 20
GJ/t.<sup id="fnref2:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup>

<h2 id="how-to-make-steel-without-fossil-fuels">
How to make steel without fossil fuels?
</h2>
<p>
There are two ways to make steel, and one is much more sustainable than
the
other.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup>
On the one hand, there is the blast furnace or basic oxygen furnace, in
which steel is made from iron ore and coal. This technology is – in its
essential form – 2000 years
old.<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
On the other hand, there is the electric arc furnace, in which steel is
made from steel scrap and electricity. The electric arc furnace, which
is a relatively new technology, consumes much less energy than the blast
furnace, makes use of a recycled resource (no need to mine iron ore),
and works without the direct use of coal or other fossil fuels (the
electricity can be supplied by solar, wind, or atomic power).
</p>
<p>
The most energy-efficient electric arc furnaces now consume less than
300 kilowatt-hours of electricity per ton of steel
produced.<sup id="fnref3:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>
Hypothetically, if we had produced all steel in 2021 (1,950 Mt) in such
furnaces, the total power consumption of the global iron and steel
industry would have been only 585 terawatt-hours (Twh). That corresponds
to just one-third of all electricity generated by wind turbines
worldwide in the same year (1,848 Twh). Unfortunately, more than 70% of
global steel output was made in blast furnaces fed by coal and iron
ore.<sup id="fnref4:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup>
A blast furnace consumes twenty times more energy and cannot be operated
by electricity because coal is both the fuel source and the chemical
reductant. The combustion of coal produces carbon monoxide that reduces
the iron from its
ore.<sup id="fnref5:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="not-enough-scrap-available">
Not enough scrap available
</h2>
<p>
The solution seems obvious: let’s produce all that steel in electric arc
furnaces. However, this is impossible. First, there’s not enough scrap
available: the continuous growth of the global steel output makes a
circular flow of resources
impossible.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup>
It takes decades before most steel becomes available for recycling. For
example, there is 543 Mt of steel stocked in
ships.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup>
The scrap available for recycling in 2021 corresponds to the production
level of 1965 when global steel production was less than one-quarter of
what it is today (450
Mt).<sup id="fnref5:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
Consequently, the other three quarters need to be produced in blast
furnaces using coal and freshly mined iron ore.

Nowadays, China produces roughly half of the steel in the world and does
that almost exclusively (+90%) in blast furnaces using coal and iron
ore. Many other steelmaking nations have a higher share of electric arc
furnaces. However, it makes little sense to point the finger at China.
First, the US and Europe have outsourced many of their industries to
China since the 2000s, a trend that corresponds neatly with the growing
steel output in that country. Furthermore, twenty to forty years ago,
China hardly used any steel. Consequently, there is almost no scrap
available. China has no other choice than to use blast
furnaces.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="ever-higher-grades-of-steel">
Ever higher grades of steel
</h2>
<p>
A second obstacle is the continuous development of higher grades of
steel. There are now over 2,500 different types of steel with a variety
of properties, such as increased strength, tolerance to high
temperatures, or corrosion
resistance.<sup id="fnref6:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref6:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
Although these higher quality steels can be produced in electric arc
furnaces, they are not made from scrap, and they have much higher energy
use.
</p>
<p>
Steel available for recycling forms a mix of steel grades. That mix is
suitable for making plain carbon steel but not highly alloyed steels,
which require scrap with similar qualities. However, that scrap is not
available. For example, stainless steel, the most produced special steel
grade, has a recycling rate of only 15%. Almost 60 Mt of stainless steel
was produced in 2021, compared to only 4 Mt in
1980.<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup>
The traditional use of stainless steel was in cutlery, surgical tools,
and medical and food processing equipment. However, it is now also used
in the construction of tunnels and outdoor furniture, wastewater
treatment, seawater desalination, nuclear engineering, and the
production of
biofuels.<sup id="fnref7:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The low recycling rate and the need for the extraction of additional
elements such as chrome and nickel make higher grades of steel more
energy-intensive to produce. For example, stainless steel production
requires almost 80 GJ per ton, four times more than the production of
plain carbon
steel.<sup id="fnref8:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup>
The continuous development of higher-grade steels is stimulated by
environmental legislation (such as the use of lighter steel in cars) and
by competition from other materials, mainly aluminum and plastic
composites.<sup id="fnref9:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref7:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref3:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup>
Ironically, the competition with these materials, which consume even
more energy, makes steel less and less sustainable.
</p>
<h2 id="steel-and-renewable-energy">
Steel and renewable energy
</h2>
<p>
The steel industry is heavily dependent on the energy supply, but the
energy supply is also heavily dependent on the steel industry. Almost
10% of the global steel output goes into building and maintaining energy
supply infrastructure. That amount corresponds to the entire steel
output in 1950. A great share of that steel goes to gas and oil
infrastructure.<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup>.
Oil and gas mining, production, and transportation require steel for
offshore drilling platforms, pipelines, refineries, tankers, and storage
tanks. Coal mining depends on steel for cutters, loaders, conveyors,
excavators, and
trucks.<sup id="fnref10:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the planned switch to low-carbon energy sources and the
electrification of heating and transport technologies will not decrease
our dependency on the steel industry – on the contrary. A low-carbon
power grid requires much more steel (and other materials) than an
infrastructure based on fossil fuels. Wind and solar power are very
diffuse power sources compared to fossil fuels. Therefore, it takes much
more materials (and land) to produce the same energy. In jargon, wind
and solar have low “power density” or high “material
intensity.”<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup>

<blockquote>

<p>
The “steel intensity” of thermal gas and coal power plants is between 50
and 60 tonnes of steel per megawatt of installed
power.<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
Hydroelectric power plants have a lower steel intensity, with 20-30
tonnes of steel per
MW.<sup id="fnref11:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>
Atomic power’s steel intensity is also lower at between 20 and 40 tonnes
of steel per installed
MW.<sup id="fnref2:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>
On the other hand, solar PV requires between 40 and 170 tonnes of steel
per installed
MW.<sup id="fnref3:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup>
Although there is little or no steel in the solar panels themselves,
it’s the material of choice for the structures that support them.
</p>
<h2 id="steel-and-wind-power">
Steel and wind power
</h2>
<p>
The most steel-intensive power source – by far – is the modern wind
turbine. The steel intensity of a wind turbine depends on its size. A
single, large wind turbine requires significantly more steel per
megawatt of installed power than two smaller wind
turbines.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
For example, a 3.6 MW wind turbine with a 100-meter tall tower requires
335 tons of steel (83 tons/MW), while a 5 MW wind turbine with a
150-meter tall tower needs 875 tons of steel (175
tons/MW).<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup>
The trend is towards taller wind turbines and a higher steel intensity.

<p>
Steel consumption further increases for offshore wind turbines. Onshore
wind power plants rely on reinforced concrete for their foundations, but
offshore wind turbines need massive steel structures such as monopiles
and
jackets.<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup>
The steel intensity for offshore wind turbines is calculated to be
around 450 tonnes per MW for a 5 MW turbine – eight times higher than
the steel intensity of a thermal power
plant.<sup id="fnref1:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>.
As these wind turbines get taller and move into deeper waters, their
steel use further increases.
</p>
<p>
The most popular offshore wind turbine nowadays has a capacity of 7 MW,
while the largest ones have a capacity of 14
MW.<sup id="fnref2:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup>
If we make a conservative estimate based on the data above (the steel
intensity doubles for every doubling of the power capacity), a 14 MW
offshore wind turbine would require 1,300 tons of steel per MW or 18,200
tonnes in total. Such a wind turbine thus consumes 24 times more steel
than a coal or gas power plant of the same power capacity.
</p>
<h2 id="shorter-life-expectancy">
Shorter life expectancy
</h2>
<p>
The difference between renewable power sources and fossil fuels becomes
even larger if the steel intensity is calculated per unit of energy
rather than power (MWh instead of MW). In contrast to coal and gas power
plants, the output of wind and solar power plants depends on the
weather, and they do not always produce their maximum power capacity.
Therefore, replacing 1 MW of fossil electricity generation capacity
requires the installation of (on average) 4 MW of solar power or 2 MW of
wind
power.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup>
A 14 MW offshore wind turbine thus has a steel intensity that is almost
50 times higher than a fossil fuel power plant for every kilowatt-hour
of electricity
produced.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

<p>
Solar and wind power plants also have shorter lifetimes (20-30 years)
compared to thermal power plants (30-60
years).<sup id="fnref1:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup>
While this does not affect the steel intensity per MW of power
installed, it again increases the steel intensity per unit of energy
produced over time. That does not always lead to a doubling of steel use
because foundations for offshore wind turbines and structures for solar
panels may have longer lifetimes than the power sources they support and
could thus be
reused.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup>
</p>
<h2 id="power-transmission-infrastructure">
Power transmission infrastructure
</h2>
<p>
The data above only include the steel used in the power plants
themselves. For fossil fuel power plants, they do not include the steel
used in the pipelines, oil rigs, coal excavators, and the like. However,
the same goes for the low-carbon power sources. Because they need much
more resources than thermal power plants (steel but also other metals
and materials), they depend on a global mining and transport
infrastructure that is just as steel-intensive as the supply chain for
fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, because they are more diffuse power sources with
intermittent and unpredictable power production, often located far away
from energy consumption centers, renewable power plants drive the
expansion of transmission infrastructure. That infrastructure is also
based on steel – from switchyard equipment over towers to conduction
cables.<sup id="fnref1:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup><sup id="fnref2:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup><sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
Finally, low-carbon power sources also have a high need for special
grades of steel, which are more energy-intensive to produce. Steel for
off-shore wind turbines should resist corrosion, and stainless steel is
increasingly used for solar panel support
structures.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup>
Electrical lamination steel (iron-silicon) is indispensable for
transformers in the power
network.<sup id="fnref12:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>
Nuclear power plants may have a relatively low steel intensity but are
completely built up of energy-intensive specialty steels. For example,
cladding the fuel elements containing fissionable uranium requires
zirconium steel, while all structural elements contain austenitic
stainless
steel.<sup id="fnref13:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup>

<p>
The high steel intensity of low carbon power sources confronts us with a
so-called “catch-22”, a situation in which there seems to be no escape
from a problem no matter what we do. We need much more steel if we
replace thermal power plants with renewable ones. Because there is not
enough steel scrap available, we can only produce that extra steel from
iron ore in blast furnaces burning fossil fuels. To address climate
change, we need to build low-carbon sources quickly and in great
numbers. However, to achieve circular material flows and build
low-carbon power sources from scrap and renewable electricity, we would
have to do the opposite: slow down the development of a low-carbon power
grid.

A well-cited study from 2013 concluded that if wind and solar power
would supply 25,000 Twh of electricity – which corresponds to total
global electricity demand in 2021 – we need about 3,200 Mt of steel to
build the power plants
alone.<sup id="fnref4:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup><sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup>
Global electricity demand is projected to grow to between 52,000 and
71,000 terawatt-hours in 2050, which would increase the extra steel
demand to between 6,400 and 8,960
Mt.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup>
Spread out over the lifetime of solar panels and wind turbines (25
years), we would have to produce 256 to 358 Mt extra steel per year to
make wind turbines and solar panel structures – comparable to the steel
demand for passenger cars (195 Mt) and other transportation modes (98
Mt) combined.
</p>
<p>
That is still a very optimistic estimation. Electricity demand only
makes up around 20% of total energy demand. If the total energy demand
(177,000 Twh in 2021) would be supplied by wind and solar, we would need
22,400 Mt of steel. That’s an extra 896 Mt steel per year – as much as
the global production in the early 2000s. You could argue that
electricity can be used more efficiently than fossil fuels, for example,
in cars and heating systems. However, at the same time, total energy
demand is expected to rise further, countering the gains made by
increased energy efficiency.
</p>
<h2 id="the-high-tech-solutions">
The high-tech solutions
</h2>
<p>
The steel industry counts on technological solutions to make steel
production carbon neutral. One option is to replace coal by gas, an
approach that is already common in the Middle East and North America.
Gas-based steelmaking results in somewhat lower carbon emissions, but
they are still much higher than in the case of the electric arc furnace.
Therefore, most attention goes to hydrogen, which can replace purified
coal (coke) as a reducing agent in a direct reduction shaft
furnace.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>
However, hydrogen-based steelmaking does not offer an escape from the
catch-22 because it further increases the need for a steel-intensive
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
The production of hydrogen is energy-intensive. It takes 50-55
kilowatt-hour to make 1 kg of hydrogen and 60 kg of hydrogen to make 1
ton of
steel.<sup id="fnref1:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup>
The production of 1 ton of steel from hydrogen thus consumes 3,000 kWh
of electricity, which is ten times higher than the electricity use of an
electric arc furnace making steel from scrap. Consequently,
hydrogen-based steelmaking requires roughly ten times more wind turbines
and solar panels than scrap-based steel production – and thus ten times
more steel. On top of this comes the steel for building the pipelines
and storage tanks that are part of the hydrogen infrastructure.

<p>
Carbon capture and storage, in which the carbon emissions of steelmaking
plants are captured and then stored underground, faces the same
problems. It requires a steel infrastructure and extra energy, thus
indirectly raising the use of fossil fuels. Reverting to older,
preindustrial steelmaking processes is not the answer either. Today’s
blast furnace is essentially still the blast furnace from earlier
centuries, only much more energy
efficient.<sup id="fnref14:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>

The low-tech solutions
</h2>
<p>
The picture painted above seems to offer little hope for carbon-neutral
steelmaking and power production. However, there is a low-tech solution
that could achieve it. We could adjust steel production to the available
scrap supply both in quantity and quality. That would allow us to
produce all steel from scrap in electric arc furnaces, dramatically
reducing energy consumption and eliminating almost all carbon emissions.
Of course, the intent should not be to replace steel with plastic
composites and aluminum because they are even more energy-intensive to
produce. The only solution is to reduce material use overall.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We could adjust steel production to the available scrap supply both in

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reducing the steel output and using more common steel grades would not
bring us back to the Bronze Age. As noted, global end-of-life ferrous
scrap availability was approximately 450 Mt in 2021, which would allow
us to produce roughly one-quarter of the current steel output.
Furthermore, the scrap supply will continue to rise for the next 40
years, enabling us to produce more and more low-emission steel each
year. By 2050, scrap availability is expected to rise to about 900 Mt,
almost half of today’s global steel
production.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup>
All that extra steel could be invested in expanding the low-carbon power
grid without raising emissions first.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of room to reduce the steel intensity of modern society.
All our basic needs – and more – could be supplied with much less steel
involved. For example, we could make cars lighter by making them
smaller. That would bring energy savings without the need for
energy-intensive high-grade steel. We could replace cars with bicycles
and public transportation so that more people share less steel. Such
changes would also reduce the need for steel in the road network, the
energy infrastructure, and the manufacturing industry. We would need
fewer machine tools, shipping containers, and reinforced concrete
buildings. Whenever steel intensity is reduced, the advantages cascade
throughout the whole system. Preventing corrosion and producing steel
more locally from local resources would also reduce energy use and
emissions.<sup id="fnref2:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref1:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
The continuous growth of the steel output – the increasing steel
intensity of human society – makes sustainable steel production
impossible. No technology can change that because it’s not a
technological problem. Like forestry can only be sustainable if the wood
demand does not exceed the wood supply, steel is sustainable or not
depending on the balance between (scrap) supply and (steel) demand. We
may not be able to escape the Iron Age, but we have an option to escape
the catch-22 that inextricably links steel production with fossil fuels.
</p>
<h2 id="steel-and-war">
Steel and war
</h2>
<p>
Another motivation for reducing the steel intensity of modern society is
to limit the consequences of geopolitical conflicts. The more steel we
produce for peaceful purposes, the more steel becomes available for war
and destruction. Remarkably, the production of military equipment is
absent from modern steel statistics, and if mentioned, its share is very
low. However, in times of war, steelmaking facilities switch to
producing steel for military purposes. The steel industry can thus be
converted into a weapons industry at any moment, and there is now a lot
more steel production capacity available than there has ever been in
history.

About 5% of global steel is produced by a third method: gas-based direct
iron reduction. These furnaces use gas instead of coal and have
therefore lower carbon emissions. However, emissions are still much
higher than in the case of the electric arc furnace. Gas-based
steelmaking mainly happens in the Middle East and North
America. <a href="#fnref:19" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

In the West, the expansion of steel use happened over a period of 150
years, in tandem with technological evolution. In contrast, China
compressed this technological evolution in just a few decades: shipping
and railways, electrification, steel buildings, the car and the
airplane, the internet, and renewable power technologies. There are
still large parts of the world where the steel intensity of society is
very low, such as India and Africa. There is thus still a lot of room
for the growth of the steel output. Source: Smil, Vaclav. Still the iron

For off-shore wind turbines, the lifetime of the foundations is
estimated to be 100 years, so in principle they could serve for
replacement wind turbines of the same size. On the other hand, it is not
self-evident that these steel foundations will eventually be recycled.
First, only around 10% of decommissioning costs can be recovered by
recycling the metal, meaning that it is not economically and perhaps
even energetically interesting to do it. Second, in some cass marine
life has flourished around the foundations. The four offshore wind farms
that had been decomissioned in 2019 lasted for 15, 18, 20 and 26 years.

<h2 id="hackintosh-is-almost-dead">Hackintosh is (almost) dead</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s true that latest macOS 14 (Sonoma) still supports the latest
generations of Intel Macs and it’s very likely that at least one or two
major versions will still be compatible. But there’s one particular
development that is de-facto killing off the Hackintosh scene. In
Sonoma, Apple has completely removed all traces of driver support for
their oldest WiFi/Bt cards, namely various Broadcom cards that they last
used in 2012/13 iMac / MacBook models. Those Mac models are not
supported by macOS for few years now thus it’s not surprising the
drivers are being removed. Most likely reason is that Apple is moving
drivers away from .kext (Kernel Extensions) to .dext (DriverKit) thus
cleaning up obsolete and unused code from macOS. They did the same with
Ethernet drivers in Ventura. ↫ Aleksandar Vacić Everybody, especially
the small but active Hackintosh community itself, knew full well the
writing was on the wall the day Apple switched to ARM, and we’re seeing
the first signs of the impending end of the community. Sure, enough
people will remain who are interested in building Hackintoshes using
older, unsupported versions of macOS, kind of like retrocomputing, but
the days of running the latest macOS release on non-Apple hardware are
coming to an end. As a fun side note, this old OSNews article I wrote in
2009 is one of the most-visited articles on our site of all time.
Hackintoshes were way, way more popular than people gave them credit
for.</p>

adds “real-time, privacy-preserving URL protection” to Chrome</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: OS News</p>
<p>For more than 15 years, Google Safe Browsing has been protecting
users from phishing, malware, unwanted software and more, by identifying
and warning users about potentially abusive sites on more than 5 billion
devices around the world. As attackers grow more sophisticated, we’ve
seen the need for protections that can adapt as quickly as the threats
they defend against. That’s why we’re excited to announce a new version
of Safe Browsing that will provide real-time, privacy-preserving URL
protection for people using the Standard protection mode of Safe
Browsing in Chrome. ↫ Jasika Bawa, Xinghui Lu, Jonathan Li, and Alex
Wozniak on the Google blog Reading through the description of how this
new feature works, it does indeed seem to respect one’s privacy, but
there could be so many devils in so many details here that you’d really
need to be a specialist in these matters to truly gauge if Google isn’t
getting its hands on the URLs you visit through this feature. But even
if all that is true, it doesn’t really matter because Google has tons of
other ways to collect more than enough data on you to build an exact
profile of you are, and what advertisements will work well no you. Any
time Google goes out of its way to announce it’s not collecting some
type of data – like here, the URLs you type into the Chrome URL bar –
it’s not because they care so much about your privacy, but because they
simply don’t need this data to begin with.</p>

Arrives in South Korea to Attend Democracy Summit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived
Sunday in South Korea on the first stop of a brief Asia tour also
including the Philippines, as Washington moves to reinforce ties with
two key regional allies.</p>
<p>Blinken landed Sunday afternoon ahead of the third Summit for
Democracy on Monday, an initiative of U.S. President Joe Biden, which
Seoul is hosting this week.</p>
<p>Before arriving in Seoul, Blinken made a brief stop in Bahrain, where
he spoke to King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa about efforts to achieve a
cease-fire in Gaza.</p>
<p>The summit, which runs from March 18-20 will bring together
government officials, NGOs and civil society members.  </p>
<p>Seoul is one of Washington’s key regional allies, and the United
States has stationed about 27,000 American soldiers in the South, to
help protect it against the nuclear-armed North.</p>
<p>Seoul’s conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol has boosted ties with
Washington and sought to bury the historical hatchet with former
colonial power Japan to better guard against Pyongyang’s threats.</p>
<p>Blinken will meet South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, the
ministry said, for discussions that will cover how to boost the
alliance, as Washington and Seoul explore how to improve their so-called
“extended deterrence” against North Korea.</p>
<p>The democracy summit has attracted some criticism due to its
selective invitation list, which excludes countries that consider
themselves democratic, such as Thailand and Turkey.</p>
<p>After Seoul, Blinken heads to Manila, a trip that will reaffirm “our
unwavering commitment to the Philippine ally,” according to State
Department spokesperson Matthew Miller.</p>
<p>He will talk with local officials including President Ferdinand
Marcos Jr. — issues with China including disputes over the South China
Sea are likely to top the agenda.</p>
<p>The U.S. is redoubling efforts to improve longstanding ties with
regional allies such as Manila, in an effort to counterbalance
China.</p>
<p>Beijing recently accused Washington of using the Philippines as a
“pawn” in the dispute over the South China Sea, after a series of
clashes around bitterly-contested islets in the waters.</p>
<p>China claims almost the entire waterway, brushing aside competing
claims from a host of Southeast Asian nations and an international
ruling that has declared its stance baseless.</p>
<p>The South China Sea is strategically vital for several countries —
including China — providing a key route for the import and export of
essential fuel, food and other goods.</p>
<p>China has rapidly grown its naval forces in recent years, and
snatched vast tracts of maritime territory, hoping to project its
military and political power well beyond the country’s shores.</p>

Military Operations Across Sahel at Risk After Niger Ends
Cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DAKAR, Senegal — The United States scrambled on Sunday to assess the
future of its counterterrorism operations in the Sahel after Niger’s
junta said it was ending its yearslong military cooperation with
Washington following a visit by top U.S. officials.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has hundreds of troops stationed at a major airbase
in northern Niger that deploys flights over the vast Sahel region —
south of the Sahara Desert — where jihadi groups linked to al-Qaida and
the Islamic State group operate.</p>
<p>Top U.S. envoy Molly Phee returned to the capital, Niamey, this week
to meet with senior government officials, accompanied by Marine
Gen. Michael Langley, head of the U.S. military’s African Command. She
had previously visited in December, while acting Deputy Secretary of
State Victoria Nuland traveled to the country in August.</p>
<p>The State Department said Sunday in a post on X, formerly Twitter,
that talks were frank and that it was in touch with the junta. It wasn’t
clear whether the U.S. has any leeway left to negotiate a deal to stay
in the country.</p>
<p>Niger had been seen as one of the last nations in the restive region
that Western nations could partner with to beat back growing jihadi
insurgencies. The U.S. and France had more than 2,500 military personnel
in the region until recently, and together with other European countries
had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance and
training.</p>
<p>But that changed in July when mutinous soldiers ousted the country’s
democratically elected president and months later asked French forces to
leave.</p>
<p>The U.S. military still had some 650 personnel working in Niger in
December, according to a White House report to Congress. The Niger base
is used for both manned and unmanned surveillance operations. In the
Sahel the U.S. also supports ground troops, including accompanying them
on missions. However, such accompanied missions have been scaled back
since U.S. troops were killed in a joint operation in Niger in 2017.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what prompted the junta’s decision to suspend military
ties. On Saturday, the junta’s spokesperson, Col. Maj. Amadou Abdramane,
said U.S. flights over Niger’s territory in recent weeks were illegal.
Meanwhile, Insa Garba Saidou, a local activist who assists Niger’s
military rulers with their communications, criticized U.S. efforts to
force the junta to pick between strategic partners.</p>
<p>“The American bases and civilian personnel cannot stay on Nigerien
soil any longer,” he told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>After her trip in December, Phee, the top U.S. envoy, told reporters
she had “good discussions” with junta leaders and called on them to set
a timeline for elections in return for restoring military and aid ties.
But she also said the U.S. had warned Niamey against forging closer ties
with Russia.</p>
<p>Neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso, which have experienced two coups
each since 2020, have turned to Moscow for security support. After the
coup in Niger, the military also turned to the Russian mercenary group
Wagner for help.</p>
<p>Cameron Hudson, who served with the Central Intelligence Agency and
State Department in Africa, said the incident shows the diminution of
U.S. leverage in the region and that Niger was angered by Washington’s
attempt to pressure the junta to steer clear of Russia. “This is ironic
since one mantra of the Biden Administration has been that Africans are
free to choose their partners,” he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. delegation visit coincided with the start of Ramadan, a
month of dawn-to-dusk fasting and intense prayer for Muslims. Niger’s
junta leader, Gen. Abdourahmane Tchiani, refused to meet them. A U.S.
press conference at the embassy in Niger was canceled.</p>
<p>The junta spokesperson, speaking on state television, said junta
leaders met the U.S. delegation only out of courtesy and described their
tone as condescending.</p>
<p>Aneliese Bernard, a former U.S. State Department official who
specialized in African affairs and director of Strategic Stabilization
Advisors, a risk advisory group, said the recent visit had failed and
the U.S. needs to take a critical look at how it’s doing diplomacy not
just in Niger but in the whole region.</p>
<p>“What’s going on in Niger and the Sahel cannot be looked at
continuously in a vacuum as we always do,” she said. “The United States
government tends to operate with blinders on. We can’t deny that our
deteriorating relationships in other parts of the world: the Gulf,
Israel and others, all have an influential impact on our bilateral
relations in countries in West Africa.”</p>

<p>While Ladybird does an okay job with well-formed web content, I

“Domato”, a DOM fuzzer from Google Project Zero, to stress test Ladybird
and fix some issues found along the way. The way this works is that
Domato generates randomized web pages with lots of mostly-valid but
strange HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I then load these pages into a debug
build of Ladybird and observe what happens. ↫ Andreas Kling I have high

Fantasia Barrino, ‘Color Purple’ Honored at 55th NAACP Image Awards</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Usher was named entertainer of the year at the 55th
annual NAACP Awards on Saturday night, which highlighted works by
entertainers and writers of color.</p>
<p>After Usher accepted his award at the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles, the superstar R&amp;B singer spoke about being thankful about
the journey of his successful career that has lasted three decades.</p>
<p>He reeled off several of his recent big moments including his
sold-out residency in Las Vegas, getting married, releasing his ninth
studio album “Coming Home” and his Super Bowl halftime performance,
which became the most-watched in the game’s history.</p>
<p>Usher beat out Colman Domingo, Fantasia Barrino, Halle Bailey and
Keke Palmer.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how many people do that much stuff in one setting,”
said the multi-Grammy winner, who was presented the award by Oprah
Winfrey. After being surprised by Winfrey’s presence, he thanked those
who have supported him throughout the years.</p>
<p>“This is for you, you, my number ones,” the singer said as the
audience repeated his words back to him. The final words of his speech
were recited lyrics from his popular song “Superstar” from his 2024
album “Confessions,” which has sold more than 10 million units in the
U.S.</p>
<p>Earlier in the ceremony, Usher was honored with the President’s Award
for the singer’s public service achievements through his New Look
Foundation. He thanked the strong women in his life, including his
mother and wife Jenn Goicoechea, whom he married after his Super Bowl
halftime performance last month.</p>
<p>“The say behind or beside or with every strong man is a stronger
woman,” he said.</p>
<p>Queen Latifah hosted the awards ceremony aired live on BET.</p>
<p>“The Color Purple” was awarded best motion picture. The musical film
featured star-studded cast including Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, Domingo,
H.E.R., Danielle Brooks, Corey Hawkins and Bailey.</p>
<p>Barrino, who starred as Celie in the film, won for best actress in a
motion picture.</p>
<p>“I didn’t prepare a speech, because I didn’t think I was going to
win,” the singer-actor said. “I was afraid to play Celie, but I’m glad I
did. Because I kept saying ‘If I don’t win an award, the awards that I
will win will come from the people who watched ‘Color Purple’ and the
women who will relate to her and feel like Oscars when they walk
out.’”</p>
<p>New Edition was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame.
The induction is bestowed on individuals who are viewed as pioneers in
their respective fields and whose influence shaped their profession.</p>
<p>“We stand here in brotherhood,” said Michael Bivins while his group
members behind him. The Grammy-nominated group includes Bobby Brown,
Johnny Gill, Ralph Tresvant, Ronnie DeVoe and Ricky Bell.</p>
<p>“You’ve seen our story. You know what we’ve been through,” said
Bivins, who spoke about the group overcoming conflict and tension in
their earlier years to now holding a residency in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“But we call each other every day,” he continued. “We text each other
every day. We check on our families. You watched us grow up. We’re still
growing.”</p>
<p>Damson Idris won best actor in a drama television series for his role
in “Snowfall.” Henson and Domingo took home best supporting roles in
“The Color Purple.” Domingo also won best actor in a motion picture for
his role in “Rustin.”</p>

id="some-in-path-of-deadly-tornadoes-in-central-us-face-long-recovery">Some
in Path of Deadly Tornadoes in Central US Face Long Recovery</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Lakeview, Ohio — Residents in a swath of the central United States
hit by deadly tornadoes were cleaning up, assessing damage and helping
neighbors on Saturday. But it will be a long recovery from the storms
that ripped through parts of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and Arkansas. </p>
<p>Thursday night’s storms claimed three lives in the Indian Lake area
of Ohio’s Logan County, one of the hardest-hit regions, and about 40
people were injured and dozens of homes damaged in one Indiana
community. Tornadoes were also reported in Illinois and Missouri. </p>
<p>Samantha Snipes, 33, said that when she first heard the tornado
warning, she called her father who lives seven minutes away and told him
to take cover. He said he was trying get into the closet in her
childhood home and then the phone cut out, she told The Associated
Press. </p>
<p>She and her husband attempted to drive down the main road to get to
him but couldn’t and had to get through the back way after the tornado
passed. </p>
<p>“It looked like out of a movie, like Twister,” she said. “My dad’s
garage was leveled. The back of his house is gone. Like everything’s
gone.” </p>
<p>They climbed over everything screaming for him. When they found him,
he wasn’t injured and he told them to stop crying, she said. </p>
<p>Her father, Joe Baker, had always told his children to hide in the
closet if there was ever a tornado. </p>
<p>“We grew up here. Like this is our childhood home,” said Snipes who
Saturday was throwing away things and figuring out what could be saved.
“And you see it on the news. But you never imagine it’s going to happen
to you.” </p>
<p>Steve Wills, a pastor who owns a vacation home down the road on
Orchard Island, said Saturday he was bringing a family crew to finish
cleaning up and cover a hole in the roof. </p>
<p>“We’re saddened for the families that lost people. There’s three
deaths in our community. You know, that breaks our heart,” Wills said.
“But it could have been so much more, so much more. Yeah, so I still
have faith.” </p>
<p>The community has been really helpful, Snipes said. </p>
<p>The school superintendent was dropping off food, clothes and diapers
on Friday. The night of the tornado, neighbors on her dad’s street were
going house to house shutting off the gas, she said. </p>
<p>“Everybody on this road is safe. You know neighbors helping neighbors
is what it’s been,” Snipes said.</p>

Jokes About His Opponent’s Age — and His Own — at DC Roast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The big news this week, U.S. President Joe Biden said at
a weekend Washington roast, was that two candidates had clinched their
party’s nomination for president. But one was too old, too mentally
unfit for the job, he said.</p>
<p>“The other’s me,” Biden quipped.</p>
<p>The digs against Republican Donald Trump kept coming from the
president at the annual Gridiron Club and Foundation Dinner, as Biden
deflected ongoing criticism that his memory is hazy and he appears
confused, instead highlighting moments when the 77-year-old Trump has
slipped up, too.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell him, he thinks he’s running against Barack Obama, that’s
what he said,” said Biden, 81, who also quipped that he was staying up
way past his bedtime.</p>
<p>It was the first time Biden has attended the dinner during his
presidency, and comes as the 2024 election looms and the rematch between
Biden and Trump heats up. The annual bacchanalia, now in its 139th year,
traces its history to 1885 — the year President Grover Cleveland refused
to attend. Every president since then has come to at least one
Gridiron.</p>
<p>Biden veered quickly into the somber, though, highlighting what he
sees as a real threat to democracy should Trump — who continues to
falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen — return to the White House.
The speech had echoes of Biden’s campaign remarks, criticizing Trump as
well as too soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>“We live in an unprecedented moment in democracy,” he said. “An
unprecedented moment for history. Democracy and freedom are literally
under attack. Putin’s on the march in Europe. My predecessor bows down
to him and says to him, ‘do whatever the hell you want.’”</p>
<p>Biden then introduced the Ukrainian ambassador, Oksana Markarova, and
Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.</p>
<p>“We will not bow down. They will not bow down, and I will not bow
down,” he said.</p>
<p>Biden, dressed in white-tie attire as is the custom, brought his
daughter Ashley.</p>
<p>The dinner has a reputation as a night of bipartisan mirth, and was
jam-packed with politicians and who’s-who of Washington, including Vice
President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, at least eight
other Cabinet members, at least five members of Congress, five governors
and at least five ambassadors. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who’s in
town for St. Patrick’s Day, also attended.</p>
<p>Also speaking at the dinner were Harris, Michigan Governor Gretchen
Whitmer, a Democrat, and Utah Goveror Spencer Cox, a Republican.</p>
<p>Biden closed out the dinner speaking about the importance of a free
press. Although he may not agree with everything the news media prints,
he said, he understands the necessity of journalism and said he was
still working to bring home journalists Evan Gershkovich and Austin
Tice, one held in Russia, the other who disappeared during a reporting
trip in Syria.</p>
<p>“Good journalism holds a mirror up to society,” he said. “We need
you.”</p>
<p>Biden and Harris were seated at the head table along with other
administration officials and the foreign leaders, plus Gridiron
president Dan Balz of The Washington Post. Also seated at the table were
Balz’s bosses, the Post’s Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and the
newspaper’s owner, Jeff Bezos.</p>
<p>The dinner was held at the Grand Hyatt. No photos or TV were
allowed.</p>

<h2 id="blobs">Blobs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</p>
<p>
On the one hand, all the <a
href="https://huggingface.co/models">models</a> that are available for
download on Hugging Face seem pretty much like programming language
compilers and interpreters that we download and use to write software.
You don’t try to open and read <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> in your
text editor. You trust that it works. Simon Willison <a
href="https://simonwillison.net/2023/Aug/3/weird-world-of-llms/">says</a>
these models are like an “opaque blob that can do weird and interesting
things”, and the same analogy seems to hold for the binary executables
we run too.
</p>
<p>
But the big difference is that, once you get various dependencies
assembled correctly, you can <a
href="https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building/">build</a>
the Python binary. The build depends on other opaque blobs being set up,
like <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a>, which in turn can be <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/build.html">built</a> by bootstrapping
using a lower level language. There are layers of abstraction at work
that can be tested, and reasoned about, which lead us to having some
confidence that things are working correctly. It might get complicated
but we can debug them when they don’t work correctly.
</p>
<p>
This is not true of the opaque blob Large Language Model (LLM). We don’t
have access to the source code that was used to create it. Compiling it
can require a huge investment in time and resources. There’s no way to
debug its logic. If you’re lucky there may be a paper about how it was
built, but some don’t because it is deemed too dangerous.
</p>
<p>
So while it feels the same, it’s really not. I just don’t understand why
people would like to integrate LLMs into applications, for generating
database queries, or API calls. It seems to me like we would want to be
able to reason about these things, and that we lose the ability to do
that when using an LLM. Why does anyone think this is a good idea?
</p>
<p>
And if this style of programming were really to catch on with a new
generation of programmers, would we lose our ability to understand SQL
or REST? Are these really useless abstractions like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembler</a>
that we want to forget? Won’t our ability to reason about our
applications atrophy? The state of software is already kind of bad, and
it seems like some people are dreaming up ways of making it even worse.

<h2 id="wal-g-3.0.0-released">WAL-G 3.0.0 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-17, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
WAL-G team is happy to announce the release of WAL-G 3.0.0
</p>
<p>
WAL-G is a tool for archival database restoration for PostgreSQL,
GreenplumDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, etcd and several other databases.
</p>
<h2>
Noteworthy Changes
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Every database engine can now benefit from failover storage. This
technique can save the day if one of the storage systems goes down.
However, do not forget to monitor them anyway.
</li>
<li>
For Postgres, we have a WAL archiving daemon available. Its primary
purpose is to improve the efficiency of parallel archiving.
</li>
<li>
Additionally, WAL-G supports the partial restoration of a cluster. If
you have large, unnecessary tables, you can exclude them from the
restoration process, the Postgres will skip over the WAL records for
these tables. See
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/PostgreSQL.md#partial-restore-experimental">docs</a>
for details.
</li>
<li>
Greenplum’s PITR (Point-in-Time Recovery) is undergoing its maturation
process. Partial restore is supported in a similar way to Postgres. We
now have tools to verify the integrity of AOfiles in storage without
actually restoring backups.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
WAL-G v3.0.0 is available for download on our
<a href="https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases">GitHub releases
page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Have a nice day!
