## Summarizing Books as Podcasts

date: 2024-12-16, from: O'Reilly Radar

Like just about everyone, we were impressed by the ability of NotebookLM to generate podcasts: Two virtual people holding a discussion. You can give it some links, and it will generate a podcast based on the links. The podcasts were interesting and engaging. But they also had some limitations. The problem with NotebookLM is that, [&#8230;]

## Misplaced trust

date: 2024-12-16, from: Status-Q blog

This might be a little technical for some readers, but don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not actually the technical detail that&#8217;s important&#8230; On my home server, I run about half a dozen services that I need to access via a web browser, so they&#8217;re all behind a Caddy reverse proxy which connects me to the right one, <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/12/16/12305/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

When a synthesizer takes on the traits of a guitar, are you opening up new soundscapes or making musical compromises? Here’s what I’ve learned.

## GHC 9.12.1 is now available

date: 2024-12-16, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC 9.12.1 is now available</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-12-16</h4>

<p>The GHC developers are very pleased to announce the release of GHC 9.12.1.
Binary distributions, source distributions, and documentation are available at
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1">downloads.haskell.org</a>.</p>
<p>We hope to have this release available via ghcup shortly.</p>
<p>GHC 9.12 will bring a number of new features and improvements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The new language extension <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0522-or-patterns.rst">OrPatterns</a> allowing you to combine multiple
pattern clauses into one.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0569-multiline-strings.rst">MultilineStrings</a> language extension to allow you to more easily write
strings spanning multiple lines in your source code.</p></li>
<li><p>Improvements to the OverloadedRecordDot extension, allowing the built-in
<code>HasField</code> class to be used for records with fields of non lifted representations.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0409-exportable-named-default.rst">NamedDefaults</a> language extension has been introduced allowing you to
define defaults for typeclasses other than <code>Num</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>More deterministic object code output, controlled by the <code>-fobject-determinism</code>
flag, which improves determinism of builds a lot (though does not fully do so)
at the cost of some compiler performance (1-2%). See <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12935">#12935</a> for the details</p></li>
<li><p>GHC now accepts type syntax in expressions as part of <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0281-visible-forall.rst">GHC Proposal <span>#281</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The WASM backend now has support for TemplateHaskell.</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental support for the RISC-V platform with the native code generator.</p></li>
<li><p>… and many more</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A full accounting of changes can be found in the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1/docs/users_guide/9.12.1-notes.html">release notes</a>.
As always, GHC’s release status, including planned future releases, can
be found on the GHC Wiki <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/GHC-status">status</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank GitHub, IOG, the Zw3rk stake pool,
Well-Typed, Tweag I/O, Serokell, Equinix, SimSpace, the Haskell
Foundation, and other anonymous contributors whose on-going financial
and in-kind support has facilitated GHC maintenance and release
management over the years. Finally, this release would not have been
possible without the hundreds of open-source contributors whose work
comprise this release.</p>
<p>As always, do give this release a try and open a <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/new">ticket</a> if you see
anything amiss.</p>

## Report: Apple is working on a foldable device the size of two iPad Pros

date: 2024-12-15, from: Liliputing

<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about small computers since the original Asus Eee PC launched in the United States in 2007, showing that it was possible to make computers that were both ultraportable and affordable. But over the years I&#8217;ve also come to find that while there&#8217;s certainly a place for small-screen devices like netbooks, tablets, and smartphones, [&#8230;]</p>

## What I say when someone asks me what are my favorite docs

date: 2024-12-15, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>I’m a terrible user of documentation. I tend to consume docs in a hurry, reading diagonally, Control+Fing my way to things. I generally mistreat the interface of docs until I obtain something resembling an answer. I do this because I’ve little time and I need to fix issues fast. I love examples I can copy and paste. I’ve little patience for verbose documentation and even less for docs that look like they were written without care or skill. I’m not only bothered by inaccuracy, but also by bad style. In a way, as a user of documentation, I’m the worst nightmare of a technical writer.</p>

## The Maritime Approximation

date: 2024-12-15, from: Status-Q blog

Spotted this nice xkcd item on Bluesky today.  It&#8217;s tempting to think it&#8217;s significant, but it is, of course, a coincidence. (People who like this might also like this elderly post and its comments.)

I asked ChatGPT to “roast me and don’t hold back” and omg that really hurts. Seems it has been remembering all the hoops I make it jump through, who knew it could harbor so much resentment. Not kidding.

This week’s preliminary injunction in the WordPress/WP Engine saga clears a lot of air for the CMS space. But does it clear enough?
