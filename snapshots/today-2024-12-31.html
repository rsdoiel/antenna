Weblog</p>

<p>
Basically, a frontier model like OpenAI’s O1 is like a Ferrari SF-23.
It’s an obvious triumph of engineering, designed to win races, and
that’s why we talk about it. But it takes a special pit crew just to
change the tires and you can’t buy one for yourself. In contrast, a BERT
model is like a Honda Civic. It’s also an engineering triumph, but more
subtly, since it is engineered to be affordable, fuel-efficient,
reliable, and extremely useful. And that’s why they’re absolutely
everywhere.

<p>It will be fascinating to watch what happens with Google Search this
coming year. It’s the behemoth. It alone is the life blood of countless
small businesses. And yet “Google Zero” threatens — radical changes to
Google search results where good, previously-reliable traffic absolutely
plummets to essentially nothing. Review site HouseFresh’s story is an
example. […]</p>

I’m coordinating a rewatch of season one of Severance on MetaFilter
Fanfare in preparation for season two (due to start on January 17th).
I’m posting an episode every three days - we are up to episode 5 so far
(excellently titled “The Grim Barbarics of Optics and Design”).

<p>
<p>Severance is a show that rewatches <em>really well</em>. There are so
many delightful details that stand out once you know more about where
the series is going.</p>

<p>In one of my YouTube videos, I talk about how I’ve wired up my
solar/battery system to ensure the energy in my home battery isn’t ever
used to charge my car (which has a much bigger battery, so doing this
doesn’t normally make sense), while still allowing the car to be charged
using any excess

<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/26/zuck-open-source-ai">There
is no technical moat</a> in this field, and so OpenAI is the epicenter
of an investment bubble.

<p>
Thus, effectively, OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution
what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution. The revolution is
real, but it’s ultimately going to be a commodity technology layer, not
the foundation of a defensible proprietary moat. In 1995 investors
mistakenly thought investing in Netscape was a good way to bet on the
future of the open internet and the World Wide Web in particular.
Investing in OpenAI today is a bit like that — generative AI technology
has a bright future and is transforming the world, but it’s wishful
thinking that the breakthrough client implementation is going to form
the basis of a lasting industry titan.

Day—A Diversion to Sound Recordings</h2>
<p>date: 2024-12-30, from: Authors Union blogs</p>
<p>Happy Public Domain Day!  Every January 1st the United States adds a
new crop of works to its public domain. Though the term of copyright is
very long, the Constitution provides that it must—eventually—end. This
transition is arguably the most important moment in the life of a
creative work, excepting only its initial creation. The […]</p>
