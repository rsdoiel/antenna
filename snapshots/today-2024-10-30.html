technical writer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-30, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti</p>
<p>
I’ve been using large language models (LLMs) for a while now. They
accelerate and improve my output at work, to the point that losing
access to them would make me feel slightly impaired in some areas.
Rather than fearing <em>WriterBot</em>, I’m embracing the additional
capabilities it grants. At the same time, I’m extremely conscious of
their limitations,
<a href="https://passo.uno/ai-anxiety-tech-writer-howto/">which are
abundant</a>. Let me tell you how LLMs are helping me in my everyday
work as a documentation engineer and where they’re unable to assist me.
