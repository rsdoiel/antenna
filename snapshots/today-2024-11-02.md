date: 2024-11-02, from: mrusme blog

## Pixel-Perfect?

date: 2024-11-02, from: Tedium site

Apple makes a move to acquire an app so Apple-like that you might be surprised to learn it’s not first-party: Pixelmator. During an age when Adobe is laser-focused on the enterprise to its peril, this might be a good thing.

<p>There are a few ways to keep costs down when building a mini PC. One is to opt for an inexpensive, low-power processor like an Intel Alder Lake-N chip. Another is to just use older processors that are no longer state-of-the-art. Chuwi&#8217;s new UBox mini PC takes the latter approach. It&#8217;s a small desktop computer [&#8230;]</p>

## Kong Go CLI

date: 2024-11-01, from: Miek Giebin blog

I&rsquo;m a fan of Kong the CLI argument parser, I use it to automatically create manual pages, (bash) completion and do a lot of validation inside it. (This guy also has other really interesting packages, and he&rsquo;s a huge fan of Go&rsquo;s struct tags).
I wanted to do validation inside Kong as well, for this Kong has validation, which is just a method (Validate() error) on a type. Now most types I have are just string or any other builtin type.
