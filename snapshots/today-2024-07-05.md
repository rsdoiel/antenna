## More signs of a cooling labor market

date: 2024-07-05, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>The U.S. economy added 206,000 jobs in June, according to the labor department. But job growth in previous months was revised down significantly. What can we make of this data? And what does it mean for next steps for the Federal Reserve? Workers also saw the slowest pace of wage growth in two years. And later: views on France&#8217;s election from a farmers market in the French city of Lille.</p>

## Moving to an RTOS on the RP2040

date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve been working on a bunch of small projects involving microcontrollers. Currently a lot of them are based around the Raspberry Pi Pico boards because I like the development experience of those a lot. They have a decent SDK and cheap hardware to get started and the debugger works with gdb/openocd so it just integrates in all IDEs that support that. One of my current projects is making a fancy hardware controller for a bunch of video equipment I use. The main things that will be controlled are two PTZ cameras (those are cameras that have motors to move them). One stationary camera and the video switching equipment that that&#8217;s hooked up to. ↫ Martijn Braam There&#8217;s more to building something like this than connecting up hardware components &#8211; there&#8217;s also software that needs to be taken care of. In this case, the author is weighing several real-time operating systems for use in the project, namely FreeRTOS, NuttX, and Zephyr. If you&#8217;re working on a similar project, this article may help in choosing the RTOS that&#8217;s right for you.

## Where Hurricane Beryl is Headed Next

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Rain storms prompted China to evacuate 240,000 in the east • A heat wave is breaking records in Moscow • Beachgoers along the Gulf of Mexico are cautioned to beware dangerous rip currents this weekend.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Fires rage in California as ‘very dangerous’ heat wave hits western states</h3><p>
	More than 100 million people in the United States remain under heat alerts. A dangerous heat wave is baking the West, with temperatures expected to peak today and tomorrow. In some desert areas, temperatures could reach 115 degrees Fahrenheit. “It’s not your typical heat wave,” <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-04/sweltering-heat-wildfire-smoke-mark-july-fourth-weekend?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZcdJ5Ge-duO3nAAozdn6X0XHnU8JvAOojkpEhPiH5rN8Q8Gna0O18M3fYCKvMNhHs1Vj4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Joe Sirard, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. “This is a dangerous heat wave, this is a high-end heat wave. Very dangerous.” The heat, combined with high winds and dry conditions, have <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-04/sweltering-heat-wildfire-smoke-mark-july-fourth-weekend?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZcdJ5Ge-duO3nAAozdn6X0XHnU8JvAOojkpEhPiH5rN8Q8Gna0O18M3fYCKvMNhHs1Vj4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">increased</a> the risk of wildfires across California, where firefighters are already battling blazes. The Thompson Fire in Northern California scorched 3,700 acres and forced nearly 30,000 people to evacuate. “Oppressive” heat and humidity will also plague the Southeast today and tomorrow.

</p><h3>2. Hurricane Beryl makes landfall in Mexico</h3><p>
	Hurricane Beryl is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/hurricane-beryl-heads-cayman-islands-mexico-after-striking-jamaica-2024-07-04/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZcdJ5Ge-duO3nAAozdn6X0XHnU8JvAOojkpEhPiH5rN8Q8Gna0O18M3fYCKvMNhHs1Vj4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lashing</a> Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula after devastating Jamaica. The system, which is currently a category 2 storm, has wind speeds of up to 110 miles per hour and is expected to bring a lot of rain and dangerous storm surge. Parts of southern Texas could feel the storm’s effects this weekend. At least 11 people have died in the hurricane and many buildings across several Caribbean islands remain without power.
</p><h3>3. Labour Party wins UK general election</h3><p>
	The Labour Party won a landslide victory in the U.K.’s general election, which means that Keir Starmer is the new prime minister and 14 years of Conservative rule have come to an end. Starmer has <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/make-britain-a-clean-energy-superpower/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZcdJ5Ge-duO3nAAozdn6X0XHnU8JvAOojkpEhPiH5rN8Q8Gna0O18M3fYCKvMNhHs1Vj4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a> to transform the U.K. into a “clean energy superpower.” Here are some of his environmental pledges:
</p><ul>
<li>Establish a publicly owned clean energy firm.</li>
<li>Fully decarbonize the power sector by 2030.</li>
<li>Double onshore wind, triple solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030.</li>
<li>Upgrade the grid and speed up clean energy projects.</li>
<li>Deny new licenses for exploring new oil and gas fields in the North Sea.</li>
<li>Ban the sale of new gas and diesel cars by 2030 and increase charging access for EVs.</li>
</ul><p>
	The Green party saw its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8969ab49-0a29-4b23-968e-5eaccb7099da?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZcdJ5Ge-duO3nAAozdn6X0XHnU8JvAOojkpEhPiH5rN8Q8Gna0O18M3fYCKvMNhHs1Vj4" target="_blank">best election results ever</a>, and quadrupled its representation in government.
</p><h3>4. EU raises tariffs on Chinese EVs</h3><p>
	The European Union confirmed yesterday it will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-04/eu-moves-ahead-with-provisional-tariffs-on-ev-imports-from-china?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZcdJ5Ge-duO3nAAozdn6X0XHnU8JvAOojkpEhPiH5rN8Q8Gna0O18M3fYCKvMNhHs1Vj4" target="_blank">impose new tariffs</a> of up to 38% on Chinese EV imports. When added to the existing duty of 10%, the tax could be nearly 50%. The move is intended to protect EU car manufacturers from an influx of cheap EVs but could also increase EV prices across the bloc because, while “Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on U.S. roads,” they're quite common in the EU, the BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy99z53qypko?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZcdJ5Ge-duO3nAAozdn6X0XHnU8JvAOojkpEhPiH5rN8Q8Gna0O18M3fYCKvMNhHs1Vj4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>.

	Germany passed reforms that will guarantee people living in apartments have the right to install solar systems on their balconies.

## Not necessarily a “new dawn” for economic policy in the U.K.

date: 2024-07-05, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>While the Labour Party saw a historic win in Thursday&#8217;s general election in the U.K., the new prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, is without a raft of money to implement sweeping reforms. So how will the new government differ economically from the one seen under Conservative rule? And later, it&#8217;s hard to prepare a meal with a newborn in your hands. That inspired one couple to open a restaurant in Atlanta.</p>

## The Biochar King of Minneapolis

date: 2024-07-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUzNTQ2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDI4NTUwMH0.AenyRn_q_RQzTjIz7sdK9cC7jqZAcYorAS-X9YS8MpM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Minneapolis may be the only city in the country with a carbon sequestration program manager on staff. Now, Jim Doten — who holds that title — is about to realize his dream of starting up one of the first municipally owned and operated carbon removal projects.
</p><p>
	The Minnesota metropolis has just purchased its very own biomass pyrolyzer, a machine that heats up tree clippings in a low-oxygen environment and turns them into a form of charcoal called <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/biochar-carbon-removal-microsoft" target="_self"><u>biochar</u></a>. As the wood grew, it sucked carbon out of the air during photosynthesis; as biochar, that carbon becomes stable for hundreds of years, if not longer.
</p><p>
	Biochar can be mixed into soil, and has a wide range of demonstrated benefits, including increasing crop yields and enhancing the soil’s capacity to hold water. Some studies suggest it can filter contaminants out of stormwater. The city plans to use the biochar in public works projects and donate it to community groups in “green zones,” neighborhoods with high levels of pollution and marginalized populations. It’s also in talks with other local governments that might be interested in buying some.
</p><p>
	“One of the things we want to do is be a regional resource for other government agencies,” Doten told me, “whether it be city, county, state agencies, making biochar available for projects addressing the effects of climate change, sequestering carbon, as well as providing environmental benefits throughout our infrastructure.”
</p><p>
	Studies say that we should be shoveling billions of tons of CO2 out of the skies each year by 2050 to keep climate change in check — and that’s on top of cutting emissions to near-zero. Scholars have compared the vast responsibility of cleaning up the carbon in the atmosphere to municipal waste management: Since the task is more of a public good than a profitable enterprise, it may be best suited for the folks we already rely on to take out the trash.
</p><p>
	A number of other municipalities have been experimenting with carbon removal to support their climate goals. Notably, Boulder County, Colorado teamed up with Flagstaff, Arizona, and a number of other cities, to form the <a href="https://grist.org/climate/why-boulder-and-flagstaff-are-pooling-resources-to-purchase-carbon-removal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Four Corners Coalition</u></a>, which is pooling resources to finance local carbon removal projects. But Minneapolis is the first, at least that I’m aware of, to essentially start its own carbon removal department.</p><p>
	Doten became a biochar evangelist more than a decade ago. He first learned of the substance’s various benefits while working in southern Afghanistan with the Minnesota National Guard in 2012. He was serving as a hydrologist on an agribusiness development team and helping village farmers rebuild soil health to improve crop yields. When he returned to Minneapolis the following year, he was eager to test out biochar’s benefits at home.
</p><p>
	Over the decade that followed, Doten worked days as the supervisor of environmental services for the city’s health department. But on the side, he led a number of biochar passion project. He convinced the public works department to use biochar in landscaping projects along street medians. He started a partnership with the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux, a tribe that runs a compost facility, to provide a mix of compost and biochar to urban gardens around the city. He got the health department to sponsor a research trial at the community farm at <a href="https://www.littleearth.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Little Earth</u></a>, a federally-subsidized housing complex primarily occupied by indigenous families. Though the study was disrupted by vandalism, the city gathered enough data to show that the plots with biochar-amended compost saw superior plant health, food production and water retention during August drought conditions.
</p><p>
	Doten told me the limiting factor for expanding these programs was the availability of biochar. The city was buying it and shipping it in from elsewhere, which Doten was also not happy about because the emissions from shipping cuts into any climate benefits. Then, in 2019, he had the opportunity to see what the city could do if finding biochar wasn’t an issue. Bloomberg Philanthropies flew Doten and his colleagues to Stockholm, Sweden, where five years earlier, the charity had helped the city finance its own biochar production facility.
</p><p>
	“So I went to Stockholm along with one of our city council members and the head of public works, and ‘I’ll be darned, oh my gosh, Jim, you weren't lying, this is a real program and it does really great things in Stockholm!” Doten recalled. He waxed on about the “Stockholm method” for planting urban trees that involves using biochar and which can help manage the flow of stormwater. Stockholm is also sending waste heat from its pyrolysis facility into a district heating system used to warm apartments.
</p><p>
	A few years later, Bloomberg Philanthropies invited other cities to apply for funding to build similar programs. Minneapolis was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/bloomberg-philanthropies-announces-mayors-challenge-winning-project-to-combat-climate-change-will-spread-to-seven-global-cities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one of three U.S. cities</u></a>, along with Lincoln, Nebraska, and Cincinnati, Ohio, to win $400,000 in 2022 to develop city-wide biochar projects. All three are expected to begin construction on their production facilities this year; Doten hopes the Minneapolis facility will be operational this fall.
</p><p>
	The city has made an agreement with Xcel Energy, the local utility, to collect the tree clippings from the company’s electrical line maintenance work — previously that material was getting burned in a power plant. Doten has also found a site for the facility — a somewhat isolated industrial property near railroad tracks — which was no easy feat in an urban environment. “It’s very difficult to site a place like this within the city that's not near residences, properly zoned, get the neighborhood approvals, council approvals, and make sure everybody's happy — well I shouldn’t say happy, but at least satisfied with the result.”
</p><p>
	The other big piece was sourcing the equipment. As my colleague Katie Brigham has <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/biochar-carbon-removal-microsoft" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a>, there are <em><em>a lot</em></em> of biochar companies. According to <a href="https://alliedoffsets.com/cdr-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one carbon removal database</u></a>, there are more than 240 such companies around the world — more than any other type of carbon removal company. But most of them have developed fancy pyrolysis machines for their own use, to develop their own carbon removal projects. There aren’t that many offering the technology for sale. Doten said he talked to most of the ones that did, and there was one company whose bid came in far below the rest — BluSky, a small startup based in Connecticut. Minneapolis purchased the company’s equipment, nicknamed the “Vulcan” system, for $585,000.
</p><p>
	“We really believe in what Jim is doing and what the city is doing,” Will Hessert, the company’s CEO, told me. “We want to see more cities doing this.”
</p><p>
	Writing in <em><em>The New Republic</em></em> in 2022, four scholars made a case for a public model for carbon removal. They argued that if the responsibility is left to private companies, it could end up like plastic recycling, which is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/822597631/plastic-wars-three-takeaways-from-the-fight-over-the-future-of-plastics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>basically a big lie</u></a> and “distracts from underlying causes while pollution continues.” Or it could end up like privately owned electric utilities who take shortcuts that end up costing lives, like how PG&E’s inadequate maintenance led to the 2018 Camp Fire in California.
</p><p>
	“Imagine a regional, community-run carbon removal authority,” they wrote, “that simultaneously pursues wetland restoration and forest management, safely operates an industrial removal facility and associated mining and geological sequestration operations, monitors carbon levels in forests, and works with farmers to maintain healthy fields that store carbon in the soil.”
</p><p>
	That’s not what’s happening in Minneapolis. The climate benefits are likely to be minimal. The city couldn’t provide me with an estimate, but a <a href="https://www.minneapolismn.gov/news/2023/november/biochar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>story about the project</u></a> from last year noted that the city anticipated having a system that could handle 3,600 tons of wood waste per year, resulting in an estimated 1,500 tons of CO2 removed. That’s about 0.04% of the city’s current annual emissions.
</p><p>
	There is a real opportunity for cities to play a role in carbon removal. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-024-00069-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> from 2022 found that cities might be able to play a significant role in carbon removal — potentially removing up to 1 billion tons per year, though the numbers are “plagued by uncertainties” — by sequestering carbon in vegetation, soils, and the built environment. In that sense, Minneapolis’ biochar program could be one component of this larger vision.

## P&B: Anton Podviaznikov

date: 2024-07-05, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 45th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Anton Podviaznikov and his blog, <a href="https://podviaznikov.com">podviaznikov.com</a></p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>If you're enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it grow, consider supporting on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I’m originally from Ukraine, I grew up there and finished university. Moved out in 2010 to explore the world. Since 2014 US was my home base.</p>
<p>I’m software engineer by trade. It was my education and first I worked as a programmer because it was my career choice. But sometime around 2011 I fell in love with the web and programming. I worked at several startups and few bigger tech companies and also created countless side projects.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I created my personal site around 2013. It is 10+ years old. I think I created it during the period when I was falling in love with programming and ideas behind web and the Internet. I got exposed to them way later in my life than people who grew up in Western Europe or US. I had a lot of personal revelations at that time in my life.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>Super simple. I discovered that writing feels “painful” for me. I really do struggle. The only way that works for me is to remove editing part and also write in the “stream of consciousness style”. I write stuff in one go. I write some essay in Apple Notes and it gets published automatically to my site while I’m writing it. I might reread it some time later and edit few things - but usually I don’t do that and just discover some typos years later.</p>
<p>Another important thing is that I mostly write on topics I don’t want to think anymore. Writing is the final step of thinking over something for me. I write down about some topic, publish it and then don’t think about that again for a while.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I wrote decent amount of essays on airplanes and trains. They are uncomfortable physically, but I found them to be a great time to write and to speed up the travel, Internet is flaky and I have space to reflect. I also like to write(and program) in coffeeshops. I like noise and I can usually fully block it out.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I’m software engineer. I always made custom stacks for my personal site. For the past 2 years my website is powered by a small tool I made. It’s a tool that publishes Apple Notes to my site. It’s called Montaigne.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>I want to say: start even earlier. But that is also difficult because I do feel that I didn’t have much to say before I was 25 yo and also I didn’t discover my “voice”. But I think trying writing helps to discover that voice.</p>
<p>Write as often as you can. If it’s 5 essays per year - it’s still good. I collected many over the years and sometimes I open some and read and get surprised with some insights I got. It’s a very interesting feeling. </p>
<p>I feel like even now I don’t capture most of the insights I have during the year. So writing more is always a good advice.</p>
<p>Write as often as you can. If it’s 5 essays per year - it’s still good. I collected many of the year and sometimes I open some and read and surprised with some insights I got. It’s very interesting feeling. </p>
<p>I feel like even now I don’t capture huge junk of the insights I have during the year. So writing more is always a good advice.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I think people should do what they feel is good for them. If you are in the position where you want/need to monetize - do that. If money is not critical, do not do it. Eg write for yourself first. On top of that there might be some second order unpredictable benefits to writing. Eg someone would reach out to you and would offer a job or collaboration. This is way better than money(if you don’t need them).</p>
<p>Hard to say how much does it cost to run my site since it runs using the tool that I made. But for other people this tool is free:)</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>

## What NATO Countries and Other U.S. Allies Contribute to the Collective Defense

date: 2024-07-05, updated: 2024-07-05, from: RAND blog

NATO countries pledge to spend 2 percent of their economies on defense and over half are on track to hit that target this year. But that 2 percent number has never been a great metric. A new country-by-country index shows in detail what allies can actually bring to the table in time of war.

## David Rosenthal on the X Windowing System’s 40th birthday

date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News

David Rosenthal, one of the primary contributors to the X Windowing System, has published an awesome blog post about the recent 40 year anniversary of X, full of details about the early days of X development, as well as the limitations they had to deal with, the choices they had to make, and the environment in which they were constrained. Once at Sun I realized that it was more important for the company that the Unix world standardized on a single window system than that the standard be Sun&#8217;s NeWS system. At C-MU I had already looked into X as an alternative to the Andrew window system, so I knew it was the obvious alternative to NeWS. Although most of my time was spent developing NeWS, I rapidly ported X version 10 to the Sun/1, likely the second port to non-DEC hardware. It worked, but I had to kludge several areas that depended on DEC-specific hardware. The worst was the completely DEC-specific keyboard support. Because it was clear that a major redesign of X was needed to make it portable and in particular to make it work well on Sun hardware, Gosling and I worked with the teams at DEC SRC and WRL on the design of X version 11. Gosling provided significant input on the imaging model, and I designed the keyboard support. As the implementation evolved I maintained the Sun port and did a lot of testing and bug fixing. All of which led to my trip to Boston to pull all-nighters at MIT finalizing the release. ↫ David Rosenthal They were clearly right. During those days, the UNIX world was using a variety of windowing systems, all tied to various companies and platforms. Standardising virtually the entire UNIX world on X aided in keeping UNIX compatible-ish even in the then-new graphical era, and X&#8217;s enduring existence to this very day is evidence of the fact they made a lot of right choices early on. Rosenthal also explains why one of the main alternatives to X, Sun&#8217;s PostScript-based NeWS, which was also co-developed by Rosenthal, didn&#8217;t win out over X. It had several things working against its adoptions and popularisation, such as Sun requiring a license fee for the source code, its heftier system requirements, and the fact it was more difficult to program for. After trying to create what Rosenthal describes as a &#8220;ghastly kludge&#8221; by combining NeWS and X into Xnews, Sun eventually killed it altogether. Of course, this wouldn&#8217;t be restrospective of X without mentioning Wayland. We and Jobs were wrong about the imaging model, for at least two reasons. First, early on pixels were in short supply and applications needed to make the best use of the few they were assigned. They didn&#8217;t want to delegate control to the PostScript interpreter. Second, later on came GPUs with 3D imaging models. The idea of a one-size-fits-all model became obsolete. The reason that Wayland should replace X11 is that it is agnostic to the application&#8217;s choice of imaging model. ↫ David Rosenthal This is about as close to a blessing from the original X Windowing System developers you&#8217;re ever going to get, but Rosenthal does correctly note that XWayland is a thing, and since not every application is going to be rewritten to support Wayland, X will most likely be around for a long time to come. In fact, he looks towards the future, and predicts that we&#8217;ll definitely be celebrating 50 years of X, and that yes, people will still be using it by then.

## Silicon Valley steps up screening on Chinese employees to counter espionage

date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Leading U.S. technology companies reportedly have increased security screening of employees and job applicants, which experts say is necessary to counter the cyber espionage threat from China.


While the enhanced screening is being applied to employees and applicants of all races, those with family or other ties to China are thought to be particularly vulnerable to pressure from the Beijing government.


But at least one Chinese computer science graduate student at a U.S. university is hoping to make his ties to China an asset. Zheng, who does not want to reveal his first name for fear of retaliation from the Chinese government, says he recently changed his focus to cybersecurity in hopes of improving his job prospects in the United States.


"The goal is a bit high, but I think I know more about China as a person born and raised in China. I hope to become a force with my own characteristics in cybersecurity and a role in fighting against Chinese cyber-attacks," said Zheng, who is seeking political asylum in the United States.


While Zheng said he is not very worried that increased security checks will affect his job prospects, he said many international students in his class worry that they will be shut out from cybersecurity jobs.


Google, OpenAI and Sequoia Capital are among a number of technology and venture capital firms that have stepped up security checks on employees and potential recruits, according to a recent report by The Financial Times.


The newspaper cited sources at those companies saying they were responding to warnings from the U.S. government about a growing threat from Chinese espionage over the past two years.


Chinese cyber espionage concerns


FBI Director Christopher Wray delivered one such message in a speech in April, saying the Chinese government has tried to steal “intellectual property, technology and research” from American industries.


In response, the U.S. government has stepped up security measures over the last two years, including updating its export control regulations to restrict China's ability to obtain advanced computing chips and artificial intelligence. The strengthened warnings to U.S. companies are part of that response.




Ivan Kanapathy, senior vice president with Beacon Global Strategies, told VOA that Silicon Valley executives share the U.S. government’s concern. "In recent years, emerging technology companies have become more wary; they don't want to fall victim to China's technology absorption strategy," he said.


"Companies can't afford to help a competitor that will put them out of business. We've seen that happen across many industries already. It's only natural for American and other allied cutting-edge companies to be concerned and take steps to mitigate the risks of PRC state-sponsored espionage," he said.


Ray Wang, CEO of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research Inc., said that the theft of American intellectual property has become more rampant since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and that people with ties to China were often targeted.


"During COVID, many folks with relatives in China were put in compromising positions where they were asked to do things for the Chinese government, or one's relatives would be put at risk," Wang said. “China has infiltrated almost every aspect of the U.S., and the U.S. is facing systemic problems.”


Kanapathy said China might also obtain American technology through talent poaching, meaning they recruit someone with experience in a particular technology and ask the person to take the technology to start a new company in China. Although it is ethically questionable, it is sometimes legal.


"China likely also tries to place its own people, including engineers, into certain companies that have desirable technologies. It's a multipronged strategy," he said.




In a statement to VOA, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu acknowledged the accusations but said the U.S. government "is short on delivering solid evidence.”


“We firmly oppose to the groundless accusations and smears towards China and hope the relevant parties can view China’s development objectively and fairly,” he wrote.


Liu also pointed out that the World Intellectual Property Organization last year named China as the world’s highest ranking middle-income economy and 12th overall in terms of independently creating intellectual property rights.


"China's scientific and technological achievements are never made through ‘stealing.’ The Chinese people, including our intellectuals, made such achievements with our talent and hard work,” he wrote.


Security screening concerns


While the enhanced security reviews usually apply to all employees, Wang said. Google and OpenAI have imposed stricter reviews for Chinese employees, and Microsoft is transferring some of its most important Chinese engineers from China to other regions of the world; NVIDIA has also been highly vigilant in screening.


Microsoft employees in China, mostly involved with cloud computing, were recently offered the opportunity to work in the United States, Australia or Ireland, among other countries, state-run outlet said in a report. The Wall Street Journal reported that Microsoft asked as many as 800 employees, mostly engineers with Chinese nationality working on cloud computing and AI, to consider relocating.


He said companies should exercise caution to avoid triggering xenophobia.


"So almost every new worker, not just Chinese nationals, should undergo the same vetting process. I think it's really important. As Asian Americans, we have to be very careful about those implications," he said.


So far, that has not been a problem for Joey Wu, a Chinese software engineer in California. Wu told VOA he has not seen stringent measures exercised against Chinese people, nor has he been treated differently due to his Chinese citizenship.


"I think the U.S. is relatively tolerant and open,” Wu said. “It is not easy for a large technology company to have so many foreign employees. Chinese companies, such as Huawei, are full of Chinese faces, with very few foreigners, and it is unlikely that Americans will be hired to play a more important role.”


Kanapathy pointed out that the founders of many technology companies are from China or India themselves, and these are the people who request security checks on Chinese citizens.


VOA contacted Google, OpenAI and Sequoia Capital for comments but did not receive a response by the time of publication.


VOA’s Adrianna Zhang contributed to this report.

## The America I love

date: 2024-07-04, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p style="font-style:normal;color:rgb(0,0,0);text-decoration:none;"><img src="https://werd.io/file/668706664b941b68e20a81f2/thumb.jpg" alt="Hey, look, it’s an American flag" width="1024" height="683"></p><p>I’m a natural-born American citizen but never lived here until my early thirties. I have a complicated relationship with the country: I never thought I’d live here until I suddenly did. As it happened, my parents moved back to look after my grandmother, and ten years later, I came here to look after my mother. I was 21 when Bush became President, having been the state governor who had executed the most people; I marched against the Iraq War from Scotland. There was never a moment where I thought, “America is a place I want to live.” But I wound up here anywhere.</p><p>The America I had no intention of being a part of is still very much here. It’s the America where people love guns and the right own semi-automatic weapons is more important than the idea that we need to stop children from being slaughtered in their schools. It’s the America where the state murders prisoners by electrocuting them or injecting them with poison or by gassing them, and where the police can gun down a person of color and walk away. It’s the America that organizes coups in other countries to further its own interests and nobody sees anything wrong with it because it keeps gas prices down. It’s the America that won’t take the bus because that’s what poor people do (and the word “poor” is doing a lot of work here). It’s rugged individualism and wealth-hoarding over community inclusion and equity. It’s racial stereotypes and old-fashioned values. It’s flag-waving. It’s Bill O’Reilly and Pat Buchanan and George W Bush and Donald Trump.</p><p>I’m sorry, but I can’t bring myself to love that America. It’s a bad place to live. Objectively, even.</p><p>But that isn’t the only America. It turns out there are lots of them: not just in the sense that each state is its own mini-nation, although that’s true too, but also in terms of layers that spread from coast to coast.</p><p>There’s an America I’m delighted to be a part of; one that I’ve come to truly love. It’s the America that understands the impact it’s had and has, both on its own communities and on the world, and genuinely wants to do much better. It’s an America that is anti-drone, anti-war, and against the military-industrial complex. It’s the America that wants to spread equity and uplift communities instead of individuals. It’s the one where nobody would ever think of banning a book or a news source, where public libraries are for everyone, where it’s commonly understood that education should be free and for all. It’s the one that loves art and literature, that provides platforms for diverse lived experiences, that believes in reparations. It loves people of all religions, and no religion, equally, and knows that the separation of church and state is a vital tenet for an inclusive democracy. It believes in democracy, come to that, and science, and data and experimentation. It believes in the common public good and in social contracts. It preserves nature and protects vulnerable communities and makes sure nobody falls through the cracks. It fights fascism of all kinds, from the loud politicians who seeks to turn the country into a theocracy to the small voices who shun difference in their local communities. It believes that immigration makes the country great, and it invites people to join as is without needing to assimilate or dissolve into a melting pot. It believes that everyone should have the right to marry whoever they choose, have the right to do what they will with their own bodies, and assert their identities however they need to. It doesn’t care how much money you make, where you come from, or what you believe: it asserts that you deserve to live well. It is inclusive, and welcoming, and beautiful. It’s Noam Chomsky and bell hooks and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Daniel Ellsberg and Chelsea Manning. It takes the damn bus.</p><p>I assure you that it exists, and it’s everywhere. I’ve traveled across this country many times now, and there are pockets of this America in the places you’d least expect, alongside the places where you <em>would</em> expect it. There are people trying to make a better country, a more progressive and inclusive country, everywhere you go.</p><p>It’s not the only America, and it’s not the loudest America. But it’s the best one, by far. I think it’s worth saying that I do love it; I want to support it; I want it to be the defining experience of being in and from this country. I don’t think that’s inevitable, but I think, if we all work at it, that it as every chance of happening. I would love that to be the case.</p></div>

## Cloudflare lets customers block AI bots, scrapers and crawlers with a single click

date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News

It seems the dislike for machine learning runs deep. In a blog post, Cloudflare has announced that blocking machine learning scrapers is so popular, they decided to just add a feature to the Cloudflare dashboard that will block all machine learning scrapers with a single click. We hear clearly that customers don’t want AI bots visiting their websites, and especially those that do so dishonestly. To help, we’ve added a brand new one-click to block all AI bots. It’s available for all customers, including those on the free tier. To enable it, simply navigate to the Security > Bots section of the Cloudflare dashboard, and click the toggle labeled AI Scrapers and Crawlers. ↫ Cloudflare blog According to Cloudflare, 85% of their customers block machine learning scrapers from taking content from their websites, and that number definitely does not surprise me. People clearly understand that multibillion dollar megacorporations freely scraping every piece of content on the web for their own further obscene enrichment while giving nothing back &#8211; in fact, while charging us for it &#8211; is inherently wrong, and as such, they choose to block them from doing so. Of course, it makes sense for Cloudflare to try and combat junk traffic, so this is one of those cases where the corporate interests of Cloudflare actually line up with the personal interests of its customers, so making blocking machine learning scrapers as easy as possible benefits both parties. I think OSNews, too, makes use of Cloudflare, so I&#8217;m definitely going to ask OSNews&#8217; owner to hit that button. Cloudflare further details that a lot of people are blocking crawlers run by companies like Amazon, Google, and OpenAI, but completely miss far more active crawlers like those run by the Chinese company ByteDance, probably because those companies don&#8217;t dominate the &#8220;AI&#8221; news cycle. Then there&#8217;s the massive number of machine learning crawlers that just straight-up lie about their intentions, trying to hide the fact they&#8217;re machine learning bots. We fear that some AI companies intent on circumventing rules to access content will persistently adapt to evade bot detection. We will continue to keep watch and add more bot blocks to our AI Scrapers and Crawlers rule and evolve our machine learning models to help keep the Internet a place where content creators can thrive and keep full control over which models their content is used to train or run inference on. ↫ Cloudflare blog I find this particularly funny because what&#8217;s happening here is machine learning models being used to block&#8230; Machine learning models. Give it a few more years down the trajectory we&#8217;re currently on, and the internet will just be bots reading content posted by other bots.

## Parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue to buy rival Neiman Marcus

date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue has signed a deal to buy upscale rival Neiman Marcus Group, which owns Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores, for $2.65 billion, with online behemoth Amazon holding a minority stake.


The new entity would be called Saks Global, which will comprise the Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks OFF 5TH brands, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, as well as the real estate assets of Neiman Marcus Group and HBC, a holding company that purchased Saks in 2013.


HBC has secured $1.15 billion in financing from investment funds and accounts managed by affiliates of Apollo, and a $2 billion fully committed revolving asset-based loan facility from Bank of America, which is the lead underwriter, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital Markets and Wells Fargo.


The deal comes after months of rumors that the department store chains had been negotiating a deal. But the twist is Amazon's minority stake, which adds "a bit of spice" to an otherwise anticipated pact, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, a research firm.


The pact was announced Thursday after months of rumors that the department store chains had been negotiating a deal.


"For years, many in the industry have anticipated this transaction and the benefits it would drive for customers, partners and employees," said Richard Baker, HBC executive chairman and CEO in a statement. "This is an exciting time in luxury retail, with technological advancements creating new opportunities to redefine the customer experience, and we look forward to unlocking significant value for our customers, brand partners and employees."


Saks and Neiman Marcus have struggled as shoppers have been pulling back on buying high-end goods and shifting their spending toward experiences such as travel and upscale restaurants. The two iconic luxury purveyors have also faced stiffer competition from luxury brands, which are increasingly opening their own stores. The deal should help reduce operating costs and create more negotiating power with vendors.


Saks Fifth Avenue currently operates 39 stores in the United States, including its Manhattan flagship. In early 2021, Saks spun off its website into a separate company, with the hopes of expanding that business at a time when more people were shopping online.


Current Saks.com CEO Marc Metrick will become CEO of Saks Global, leading Saks Global's retail and consumer businesses and driving the strategy to improve the luxury shopping experience.


Neiman Marcus filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2020 during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic but emerged in September of that year. Like many of its peers, the privately held department store chain was forced to temporarily close its stores for several months.


Meanwhile, other department stores are under pressure to keep increasing sales.


Lord & Taylor announced in late August 2020 it was closing all its stores after filing for bankruptcy earlier that month. It's operating online. Macy's announced in February of this year that it will close 150 unproductive namesake stores over the next three years, including 50 by year’s end.


Consumers have proven resilient and willing to shop even after a bout of inflation, although behaviors have shifted, with some Americans trading down to lower-priced goods.

## Some sanity for C and C++ development on Windows

date: 2024-07-04, from: OS News

The article&#8217;s from 2021, but I think it&#8217;s still worth discussing. A hard reality of C and C++ software development on Windows is that there has never been a good, native C or C++ standard library implementation for the platform. A standard library should abstract over the underlying host facilities in order to ease portable software development. On Windows, C and C++ is so poorly hooked up to operating system interfaces that most portable or mostly-portable software — programs which work perfectly elsewhere — are subtly broken on Windows, particularly outside of the English-speaking world. The reasons are almost certainly political, originally motivated by vendor lock-in, than technical, which adds insult to injury. This article is about what’s wrong, how it’s wrong, and some easy techniques to deal with it in portable software. ↫ Chris Wellons As someone who doesn&#8217;t know how to code or program, articles like these are always difficult to properly parse. I understand the primary problem the article covers, but what I&#8217;m curious about is how much of this problem is personal &#8211; skill issue &#8211; and how much of it is a widely held belief by Windows developers and programmers. I know there&#8217;s quite a few of you in our audience, so I&#8217;d love to hear from you how you feel about this. The author also authored his on fix, something called libwinsane, which I&#8217;m also curious about &#8211; is this the only solution, or are there more options out there?

## Thousands evacuate as Northern California wildfire spreads, more hot weather expected

date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA

OROVILLE, Calif. — Firefighters lined roads to keep flames from reaching homes as helicopters dropped water on a growing wildfire Wednesday in Northern California that has forced at least 26,000 people to evacuate, as the state sweltered under extreme heat.


The Thompson fire broke out before noon Tuesday about 110 kilometers north of Sacramento, near the city of Oroville in Butte County. It sent up a huge plume of smoke that could be seen from space as it grew to more than 14 square kilometers. There was no containment.


But Oroville Mayor David Pittman said by Wednesday afternoon there had been a "significant drop in the fire activity," and he was hopeful that some residents could soon be allowed to return home. The fire's progress was stopped along the southern edge and firefighters working in steep terrain were trying to build containment lines on the northern side.


"On that north side they have some real struggles in terms of the topography," Pittman said.


More than a dozen other blazes, most of them small, were active in across the state, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. A new fire Wednesday afternoon prompted a small number of evacuations in heavily populated Simi Valley, about 65 kilometers northwest of downtown Los Angeles.


The state's largest blaze, the Basin Fire, covered nearly 57 square kilometers of the Sierra National Forest in eastern Fresno County and was 26% contained.


In Oroville, a state of emergency was declared Tuesday night and evacuation centers were set up. The evacuation zone expanded Wednesday into foothills and rural areas beyond the city that's home to about 20,000 people. With July Fourth in mind, authorities also warned that fireworks are banned in many places, including most of Butte County.


There was no immediate official report on property losses. An Associated Press photographer saw fire burn three adjacent suburban-style homes in Oroville.


The fire ignited sprigs of grass poking from the concrete edges of Lake Oroville as gusty winds whipped up American flags lining a bend of the state's second largest reservoir and the nation's tallest dam.


Residents stood on hillsides in the night, watching the orange glow, as aircraft made water drops to keep the fire from spreading. A crew of more than a dozen firefighters saved one home as goats and other farm animals ran to find safety.


The fire's cause is being investigated. Red flag warnings for critical fire weather conditions, including gusty northerly winds and low humidity levels, were in effect when it erupted.


The warnings were expected to remain in effect until 8 p.m. Wednesday, said Garrett Sjolund, the Butte County unit chief for Cal Fire.


"The conditions out there that are in our county this summer are much different than we've experienced the last two summers," Sjolund said in an online briefing. "The fuels are very dense, brush is dry. And as you can see, any wind will move a fire out very quickly."


The conditions led Pacific Gas & Electric to implement targeted public safety power shutoffs in parts of some Northern California counties to prevent fires from being ignited by downed or damaged wires.


More high temperatures above 100 degrees (37.8 Celsius) were forecast Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. Hot conditions were expected to continue into next week.


Authorities warned of full legal consequences for any illegal use of fireworks during the Fourth of July holiday.


"Don't be an idiot, cause a fire and create more problems for us," said Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea. "No one in the community is going to want that. And we certainly don't want this."


The governor's office announced late Tuesday that federal funding had been approved to help with firefighting efforts. Gov. Gavin Newsom this week activated the State Operations Center to coordinate California's response, dispatch mutual aid and support communities as they respond to threats of wildfire and excessive heat.


In Southern California, Joshua Tree National Park officials closed Covington Flats, an area with most of the park's important Joshua tree populations, on Wednesday because of extreme fire risk after spring rains led to abundant grass that has now dried. A June 2023 fire burned 4.14 square kilometers of Joshua trees and desert tortoise habitat.

## GM to pay $146 million in penalties for excess auto emissions

date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — General Motors will pay nearly $146 million in penalties to the federal government because 5.9 million of its older vehicles do not comply with emissions and fuel economy standards.


The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement Wednesday that certain GM vehicles from the 2012 through 2018 model years did not comply with federal fuel economy requirements.


The penalty comes after the Environmental Protection Agency said its testing showed the GM pickups and SUVs emit more than 10% more carbon dioxide on average than GM's initial compliance testing claimed.


The EPA says the vehicles will remain on the road and cannot be repaired. The GM vehicles on average consume at least 10% more fuel than the window sticker numbers say, but the company won't be required to reduce the miles per gallon on the stickers, the EPA said.


"Our investigation has achieved accountability and upholds an important program that's reducing air pollution and protecting communities across the country," EPA Administrator Michael Regan said.


GM said in a statement that it complied with all regulations regarding the pollution and mileage certification of its vehicles. The company said it is not admitting to any wrongdoing nor that it failed to comply with the Clean Air Act.


The problem stems from a change in testing procedures that the EPA put in place in 2016, GM spokesperson Bill Grotz said.


Owners don't have to take any action because there is no defect in the vehicles, Grotz said.


"We believe this voluntary action is the best course of action to resolve the outstanding issues with the federal government," he said.


The enforcement action involves about 4.6 million full-size pickups and SUVs and about 1.3 million midsize SUVs, the EPA said. The affected models include the Chevy Tahoe, Cadillac Escalade and Chevy Silverado. About 40 variations of GM vehicles are covered.


GM will be forced to give up credits used to ensure that manufacturers' greenhouse gas emissions are below the fleet standard for emissions that applies for that model year, the EPA said. In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, GM said it expects the total cost to resolve the matter will be $490 million.


Because GM agreed to address the excess emissions, EPA said it was not necessary to make a formal determination regarding the reasons for the excess pollution.


But David Cooke, senior vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, questioned how GM could not know that pollution exceeded initial tests by more than 10% because the problem was so widespread on so many different vehicles.


"You don't just make a more than 10% rounding error," he said.


Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign for the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity, said the violations by GM "show why automakers can't be trusted to protect our air and health, and why we need strong pollution rules. Supreme Court, take notice!"


In similar pollution cases in the past, automakers have been fined under the Clean Air Act for such violations, and the Justice Department normally gets involved, Cooke said. Hyundai and Kia, for instance, faced Justice Department action in a similar case.


The Justice Department declined to comment, and GM said the settlement resolves all government claims.


Cooke said it's possible that GM owners could sue the company because they are getting lower gas mileage than advertised.


In 2014, Hyundai and Kia entered into a settlement in which they had to pay a $100 million civil penalty to end a two-year investigation into overstated gas mileage on window stickers of 1.2 million vehicles.

## TSA expects to screen a record number of July 4th travelers

date: 2024-07-04, from: VOA News USA

WEST PALM BEACH, Florida — Nicole Lindsay thought she could beat the holiday-week travel rush by booking an early morning flight. It didn't work out that way.


"I thought it wouldn't be that busy, but it turned out to be quite busy," the Baltimore resident said as she herded her three daughters through Palm Beach International Airport in Florida. "It was a lot of kids on the flight, so it was kind of noisy — a lot of crying babies."


Lindsay said the flight was full, but her family arrived safely to spend a few days in Port Saint Lucie, so she was not complaining.


Airlines hope the outcome is just as good for millions of other passengers scheduled to take holiday flights over the next few days.


AAA forecasts that 70.9 million people will travel at least 80 kilometers from home over a nine-day stretch that began June 27, a 5% increase over the comparable period around the Fourth of July last year. Most of those people will drive, and the motor club says traffic will be the worst between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. most days.


Federal officials expect air-travel records to fall as Americans turn the timing of July Fourth on a Thursday into a four-day — or longer — holiday weekend.


The Transportation Security Administration predicts that its officers will screen more than 3 million travelers at U.S. airports on Sunday. That would top the June 23 mark of more than 2.99 million. American Airlines said Sunday is expected to be its busiest day of the entire summer; it plans more than 6,500 flights.


TSA was created after the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, and replaced a collection of private security companies that were hired by airlines. Eight of the 10 busiest days in TSA's history have come this year, as the number of travelers tops pre-pandemic levels.


The head of the agency, David Pekoske, said Wednesday that TSA has enough screeners to handle the expected crowds this weekend and through the summer.


"We have been totally tested over the course of the last couple of months in being able to meet our wait-time standards of 10 minutes for a PreCheck passenger and 30 minutes for a standard passenger, so we are ready," Pekoske said on NBC's Today show.


Peggy Grundstrom, a frequent traveler from Massachusetts who flew to Florida to visit her daughter and granddaughter, said the line for security in Hartford, Connecticut, was unusually long.


"It was busier than I have personally seen in the past," Grundstrom said. "But, you know, I prefer to fly unless it's very local. I'm at a stage where I don't want to travel in a car for long periods of time."


Polls consistently show that a high percentage of Americans think the economy is poor, but that is not stopping them from traveling this summer.


"My finances are always pretty tight," said Madison Tilner, a law-school student at Northwestern University who was waiting for a flight at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. But with a work life looming ahead of her, she said, "I'm trying to travel more and use my free time while I can. I think a lot of people feel that way in summer."


Passengers on about 3,000 flights Wednesday were spending some of their free time hanging around airports because of flight delays, according to FlightAware.
