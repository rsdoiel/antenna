<p>Extreme wildfires like these will continue to have a large impact on
global climate. Stoked by Canada’s warmest and driest conditions in
decades, extreme forest fires in 2023 released about 640 million metric
tons of carbon, NASA scientists have found. That’s comparable in
magnitude to the annual fossil fuel emissions of a large industrialized
nation. […]</p>

dealing with significant stresses that prior generations didn’t have to

<ol type="1">
<li>3 takeaways from the DOE’s energy jobs report
</h3>
<p>
The U.S. Department of Energy’s annual Energy and Employment report is
out today. It’s a compendium of information on employment and job growth
across the many energy-related sectors of the economy, and contains
hundreds of data points on which job areas grew, which shrank, and by
how much in 2023. The report “is perhaps one of the current
administration’s last opportunities to prove that President Biden’s —
and, by extension, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ — policies to
stimulate the U.S. economy with investments in clean energy are
working,”
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/2023-energy-and-employment-report?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_8wKmKD0usP0xlWDrV9SS9KRLlBDVi0AzzVlTHa4XXLTButT3dv7-d9pw5xD360dMPGbmt" target="_self">wrote</a>

are her three takeaways</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The total number of clean energy jobs grew</strong> 4.2% last
year, double the rate of job growth in the rest of the energy industry
as well as in the economy at large. It’s also
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20USEER%20REPORT-v2.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_8wKmKD0usP0xlWDrV9SS9KRLlBDVi0AzzVlTHa4XXLTButT3dv7-d9pw5xD360dMPGbmt" target="_blank">up
from 3.9% the year before</a>. The flipside: Fossil fuel jobs still
accounted for 44% of new employment. In other words, it looks like
fossil fuel-related energy fields are not just standing still, they are
growing.
</li>
<li>
<strong>The unionization rate</strong> for clean energy jobs surpassed
that of the energy sector as a whole last year for the first time. The
report attributes the rise to an overall increase in construction and
utility employment — two industries that already have high union
density.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Diversity in energy jobs</strong> remains abysmal. Women held
just 26% of energy jobs last year, despite making up 47% of the national
workforce. Black workers are also particularly underrepresented in the
energy sector, holding just 9% of energy jobs compared to 13% of the job
market as a whole.
</li>
</ul>

an effort to reach out to 1.5 million Americans about voting for
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. The campaign will rely on
3,000 volunteers to contact voters in Arizona, Florida, Georgia,
Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania to remind them of the
differences between Harris and her Republican opponent, former President
Donald Trump, on the issue of climate change. But the Sunrise Movement
won’t go so far as to offer its endorsement to Harris just yet – if it
ever does. It’s waiting for her to flesh out her climate policies before

<li>Lego announces plan to stop using fossil fuels to make plastic toy
bricks
</h3>
<p>
Lego, the world’s largest toymaker, announced today that it will remove
fossil fuels from its plastic bricks by 2032. The plan is to make toys
using a new kind of renewable and recycled plastic made from biowaste,
like oil or fat discarded from the food industry. This is more expensive
than using cheap and plentiful fossil fuels, and the company will pay up
to 70% more for the certified renewable resin in hopes that this will
spur on production of recycled and renewable plastics. Lego will dig
into operating profit to pay for the added expense rather than hiking
prices, CEO Niels Christiansen

the <em>Financial Times</em>. Thanks in part to the company’s
partnership with the makers of the Fortnite video game, profits in the
first half of 2024 were up a record 26%, even as the broader toy market
declined by 1%. Most virgin plastics are made from fossil fuels, and
plastic production is projected to be a new growth market for oil in the
years to come.

clean energy jobs growth rate double that of overall jobs, report
says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Jobs in the U.S. clean energy industry in 2023 grew at
more than double the rate of the country’s overall jobs, and
unionization in clean energy surpassed for the first time the rate in
the wider energy industry, the Energy Department said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Employment in clean energy businesses - including wind, solar,
nuclear and battery storage — rose by 142,000 jobs, or 4.2% last year,
up from a rise of 3.9% in 2022, the U.S. Energy and Employment Report
said. The rate was above the overall U.S. job growth rate of 2% in
2023.</p>
<p>Unionization rates in clean energy hit 12.4%, more than the 11% in
the overall energy business, it said. That was driven by growth in
construction and utility industries and after legislation passed in 2022
including the bipartisan CHIPS Act and President Joe Biden’s Inflation
Reduction Act, the department said.</p>
<p>Construction jobs in clean energy, driven by the legislation and
private-sector investments, “is expected to continue for decades to
build out the clean energy infrastructure that we need,” Betony Jones,
the Energy Department’s head of energy jobs, told reporters in a call.
While unionized members “might move from project to project, there is
continuity of that work in order for workers to make a career in that
industry,” she said.</p>
<p>Employment in the utility scale and rooftop solar industries grew
5.3% adding more than 18,000 jobs, it said. The solar installation
industry in California, the country’s most populous state, says it has
lost more than 17,000 jobs due to high interest rates and the state’s
lowering of net meter rates that allow customers to be credited for
excess power their rooftop panels generate.</p>
<p>New jobs in fossil fuels were mixed. The natural gas workforce grew
by more than 77,000 or 13.3%, while jobs in petroleum fell more than
44,000 or 6%. Coal jobs fell nearly 8,500 or 5.3% as power generation
continued to switch from coal to gas, wind and solar. White House
climate adviser Ali Zaidi told reporters that the report showed the
administration’s commitment to pursue both energy and climate
security.</p>
<p>Energy remained a mostly male workforce with an average of 73% in
2023 compared with the national workforce average that was 53% male, the
same numbers as in the previous year. Women accounted for about half the
energy jobs added in 2022, but only 17% of the jobs added in 2023, the
report said.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The Biden administration has struggled to convince Americans that it has
done much of anything to improve the economy. Despite a
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/23/trump-biden-us-economy-compared/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">strong
labor market, low unemployment, and steady GDP growth</a>, a
<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647846/low-economic-confidence-steady.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent
Gallup poll</a> found that 70% of Americans believe the economy is
“getting worse.” As recently as three months ago, about half the country
was under the impression that unemployment is at a 50-year high, despite
the true rate being at a nearly 50-year low, according to
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/22/poll-economy-recession-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
poll conducted for The Guardian</a>. Prior to the Democratic National
Convention earlier this month, poll results from ABC News and the
Washington Post showed voters had more faith in Donald Trump to steward
the economy than they did in Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.
</p>
<p>
A new report published Wednesday is perhaps one of the current
administration’s last opportunities to prove that Biden’s — and, by
extension, Harris’ — policies to stimulate the U.S. economy with
investments in clean energy are working. The U.S. Department of Energy’s
annual Energy and Employment report, a compendium of information on
employment and job growth across the many energy-related sectors of the
economy, contains hundreds of data points on which job areas grew, which
shrank, and by how much in 2023. There is also a 300-plus page addendum
with data on every state, illustrating which industries are taking off
where. As the Deputy Secretary of Energy David Turk said on a press call
this week, it is the “best snapshot we have of who works in the energy
field and what jobs they’re performing.”
</p>
<p>
The snapshot shows that policies like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law
and the Inflation Reduction Act are indeed turning the massive ship that
is the energy economy, and doing so in a way that creates good jobs,
albeit slowly, and in fits and starts. Here are three themes from the
data that stuck out.
</p>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clean energy jobs are multiplying. So are fossil fuel jobs.
</h3>
<p>
The report highlights major growth in clean energy jobs, which it
defines as those relating to “net-zero emissions aligned technologies.”
That includes renewable energy, nuclear, non-fossil energy efficiency,
zero emissions vehicles, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage.
In 2023, these fields accounted for <em><em>more than half</em></em> —
56% — of new jobs in the energy sector as a whole. The total number of
clean energy jobs grew 4.2% last year, which is double the rate of job
growth in the rest of the energy industry as well as in the economy at
large. It’s also
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/2023%20USEER%20REPORT-v2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>up
from 3.9% the year before</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
One of the fastest growing fields was low-emissions vehicles, which
added nearly 25,000 jobs last year, with the majority of them (17,000)
in battery electric vehicles. EV charging jobs also saw a major increase
of 25%, although the field is still small, employing fewer than 3,000
people. Roles on renewable energy projects also expanded significantly,
accounting for 79% of net new employment in electric power generation,
including more than 18,000 new jobs in solar.
</p>
<p>
There’s a flipside to these numbers. Although we added more clean energy
jobs than fossil fuel energy jobs last year, the latter still accounted
for 44% of new employment. In other words, it looks like fossil
fuel-related energy fields are not just standing still, they are
<em><em>growing</em></em>. In some cases, this may not be the full story
— for example, jobs working on gasoline and diesel vehicles grew more
than those working on EVs in absolute terms, adding more than 39,000
positions last year. Many of those were likely maintenance and repair
jobs, however, which saw more growth overall than manufacturing.
</p>
<p>
But in other sectors, the numbers are trending in the other direction.
Coal power jobs declined, but at a lower rate than in 2022. Coal mining
jobs, on the other hand, increased by 3.4%, which is more than three
times what employers anticipated when the DOE surveyed them last year.
Now these employers are predicting coal mining jobs will grow again by
more than 9% this year. As my colleague Matthew Zeitlin has reported,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/coal-gas-plant-retirements" target="_self"><u>coal
plant retirements have slowed</u></a> due to concerns about grid
reliability and soaring electricity demand.
</p>
<p>
White House National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi acknowledged the opposing
trends during the press conference, noting that President Biden has
worked to bring down gas prices and to “have the supplies that we need
to run the economy” even as he pursues economy-wide decarbonization. “I
think what you see in the jobs report is a reflection of the commitment
to pursue energy and climate security, to manage our short term needs
and the long term imperative,” he said.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Union density in clean energy is increasing
</h3>
<p>
The unionization rate for clean energy jobs surpassed that of the energy
sector as a whole last year for the first time, with 12.4% of clean
energy workers represented by a union, compared to 11% in the entire
energy sector. The report attributes the rise to an overall increase in
construction and utility employment — two industries that already have
high union density.
</p>
<p>
My own recent reporting found that the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/ira-anniversary-labor" target="_self"><u>labor
provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act seem to be working</u></a> to
improve the quality of clean energy jobs and expand opportunities for
union labor. Union leaders told me they are seeing more opportunities in
renewables — particularly in solar — than before, and that their
apprenticeship programs are growing.
</p>
<p>
That may be contributing to another trend identified by the new report:
Employers in all energy fields reported that it was not as difficult to
find workers as they said it was the year before.
</p>
<p>
“We’re really encouraged by the high rates of unionization in clean
energy,” Betony Jones, the director of the Office of Energy Jobs, said
on the press call this week, “because good jobs attract workers, and
better jobs attract better workers. The data show that employers are
having an easier time finding qualified workers, so these two things go
hand in hand.”
</p>
<p>
Many of the gains have been in clean energy construction, jobs that are
inherently short-term. But Jones pushed back on that distinction. “The
construction activity that’s being driven by BIL and IRA and private
sector investments across the country is expected to continue for
decades,” she said. “So while workers might move from project to
project, there is continuity of that work in order for workers to make a
career in that industry.”
</p>
<p>
Unions have also made some inroads in manufacturing. Earlier this year,
the United Auto Workers
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gms-ultium-cells-workers-vote-ratify-new-contract-2024-06-17/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ratified
a contract with Ultium Cells</u></a> to produce EV batteries in Ohio.
And earlier this month, the United Steelworkers Union
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/16/biden-unions-solar-industry-steelworkers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reached
a neutrality agreement with Convalt Energy</u></a>, a solar manufacturer
planning to open a new factory in New York. That means the company has
agreed not to interfere with workers’ efforts to unionize.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Diversity in energy jobs is still abysmal
</h3>
<p>
When I was reporting on the
<a href="https://grist.org/energy/electrician-shortage-electrify-everything-climate-infrastructure-labor/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shortage
of residential electricians in the country</u></a> a few years ago, I
was shocked to learn that women made up less than 2% of the field. But
the issue is not unique to electricians, and its effects aren’t limited
to women. Clean energy jobs — and energy jobs more generally — are
largely performed by white men. Despite many new efforts going on around
the country to diversify the workforce, not much progress has been made.
</p>
<p>
Women held just 26% of energy jobs last year, despite making up 47% of
the national workforce. When new jobs came along, an even smaller
proportion, 17%, were filled by women. That’s way worse than the
previous year, when half of new energy jobs were filled by women. Black
workers are also particularly underrepresented in the energy sector,
holding just 9% of energy jobs compared to 13% of the job market as a
whole.
</p>
<p>
Other underrepresented groups were able to gain more market share.
Hispanic and Latino workers filled about a third of new energy jobs and
now make up 18% of the sector, compared with 19% of the national
workforce.
</p>
<p>
Cynthia Finley, the vice president for workforce and strategic
innovation at the Interstate Renewable Energy Council, told me that
increasing diversity in the energy workforce requires a two-pronged
approach — helping employers understand how to find workers from other
demographics, but also bringing awareness about these jobs to a more
diverse population. As more money from the Inflation Reduction Act —
such as the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/the-biden-administration-is-unleashing-20-billion-for-green-banks" target="_self"><u>$27
billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund</u></a> that will be rolling out
over the next year — flows to communities for clean energy, her group
aims to seize the opportunity.
</p>
<p>
“Our hope is to be in those same underrepresented communities that the
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund attempts to serve,” she said, “and to
bring the career awareness and the outreach and exploration about these
jobs and connect them to quality training and education at the same
time. So not only are we getting homes that are more energy efficient,
but the workforce comes from these same communities as well.”

It’s time to start talking about a big year for climate politics and
policy: 2025. No matter who wins this fall’s elections, next year’s
executive and legislative climate policy will be huge for America’s
decarbonization strategy. Congress is all but guaranteed to negotiate
over key parts of the country’s tax code, and whoever controls the White
House will have to finalize the Inflation Reduction Act’s last few big
programs.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:<br/>
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>Where climate policy succeeds the most,
in my view, is where it sits in an intersectional role — where it is not
climate policy as purely climate policy, but rather climate policy as
something that is tied to a broader agenda. And one that — as you
articulated, Josh — at least in rhetoric, is something that is
bipartisan. It’s a prior set of priorities, shared across the political
divide, to see American companies do well, and to see America play a
strong role in the world stage. I think the details of that are
obviously very important, and there’s a lot of different ways that could
go.<br/> <br/> <strong>Josh Freed: </strong>And Jesse, one other point I
think you made that’s really important is, because of the transformative
nature of the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, and even Justice40 and everything else that we’ve seen, climate
policy is an underpinning of so much of whatever the next Democratic
administration, a Harris administration, would do that, rhetorically, it
may not even be mentioned that much. We didn’t hear Kamala Harris
discuss climate change extensively last night in her remarks. However,
when she talks about security, when she talks about economic
opportunity, when she talks about the strength of the American economy,
it is driven in by what we are seeing happen and what happens next on
all of the mechanisms that the Inflation Reduction Act created, and on
the potential for us to get permitting reform, whether it’s later this
year or next year.<br/> <br/> It’s this very interesting next step for
us in climate and clean energy policy, where it is just implicit that
it’s happening rather than something that has to be explicitly talked
about as much politically. And so, you know, this isn’t something where
we necessarily need to have a President Harris marching around the
country, talking about it explicitly, because people are going to see
and feel that it’s going to look different, and therefore it can be
weaved into whatever new way forward she is describing because people
will see their communities looking and feeling differently than they did
four, six, eight, 10 years ago. If I think of some of the other
components that we were talking about — permitting reform gets unlocked.
Some of the challenges that we’re seeing because deployment takes a
little while, because delivery of grants takes a little while, get
unstuck even more. And she provides that broader vision.<br/> <br/> And
I think that one of the things is that, Joe Biden, when he ran in 2020,
talked about himself in somewhat the context of a transitional figure.
And he bridged the old economy and a different way of doing things than
we do in 2022, 2024, with what the future looks like. And Kamala really
is positioning herself as a new generation and next chapter of
leadership. And so if you see the benefits of it — and she talks about
what’s happening within some sort of broader context, which I think is
going to have more of a care economy focus, a very muscular American
foreign policy focus — again, it’s going to be implicit in all of that,
and there will be evidence of it.<br/> <br/> <strong>Robinson Meyer:
</strong>I guess I feel like I can imagine this as a campaign line,
coming out maybe later in October, as the Fed’s going to cut, inflation
should hopefully moderate, the labor market hopefully won’t soften too
much, and then you can start to make an affirmative case about the
economy. I think one issue that Harris has had broadly here is that she
has to signal that she understands that voters are not happy with the
current state of the economy.

<h2 id="what-might-kamala-harris-mideast-policy-look-like">What might
Kamala Harris’ Mideast policy look like?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The White House welcomed on Tuesday the rescue of an
Israeli hostage abducted October 7 by Hamas and said a Gaza cease-fire
deal is being finalized.</p>
<p>But even if an agreement is reached, a truce is unlikely to extend
beyond the six weeks of phase one of the three-phase deal. The next U.S.
administration will still inherit the role of managing tensions in the
region.</p>
<p>Since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President
Kamala Harris has aimed to strike a balance between reaffirming U.S.
support for Israel and advocating for Palestinian humanitarian needs —
in essence, signaling a continuation of President Joe Biden’s policies
on the Israel-Hamas war and, more broadly, the Middle East.</p>
<p>Harris summed up her position in her acceptance speech as the
Democratic presidential nominee at the party’s convention in
Chicago.</p>
<p>“President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel
is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and
the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security,
freedom and self-determination,” she said.</p>
<p>Democrats are enthusiastic about Harris, even though she has not yet
laid out her own policies. And unlike Biden, a longtime member of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, most of Harris’ exposure to foreign
policy was during her tenure as vice president.</p>
<p>Not having “foreign policy baggage” might benefit Harris in the eyes
of Democratic voters, said Natasha Hall, senior fellow with the Middle
East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p>
<p>Hall pointed out that in October 2002, Biden was one of 77 senators
who gave President George W. Bush the authority to use force in Iraq, a
decision that eventually became a liability for Biden, much as his
staunch support for Israel has become the most divisive issue in his own
party.</p>
<p>Adviser’s influence</p>
<p>Those looking to see whether Harris’ Mideast policy will diverge from
Biden’s can look to her national security adviser, Phillip Gordon, who
is expected to remain in the role if she is elected. He would be the
principal adviser to the president on all national security issues,
including foreign policy.</p>
<p>“Phil Gordon is the type of adviser that colors in the lines,” Hall
told VOA. “He’s the kind of person that I think very much is sort of
old-fashioned American foreign policy.”</p>
<p>Gordon was against ousting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power
in 2003. He chronicled American efforts to overthrow leaders in the
Middle East in his 2020 book, “Losing the Long Game: The False Promise
of Regime Change in the Middle East.”</p>
<p>“The U.S. policy debate about the Middle East suffers from the
fallacy that there is an external American solution to every problem,
even when decades of painful experience suggest that this is not the
case,” he wrote. “And regime change is the worst ‘solution.’”</p>
<p>Such an outlook would make a Harris administration “very, very
cautious to deal assertively with Iran,” said Jonathan Rynhold, head of
the Political Studies Department at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University.</p>
<p>From an Israeli perspective, however, Harris’ direct involvement in
the administration’s recent decision to deploy more military assets to
the Middle East to deter Iran is good news, Rynhold told VOA.</p>
<p>“If that is the policy that she goes on to adopt, then that crosses
the minimal threshold of what Israel needs on Iran,” he said. “It may
not be what Israel desires, which is a more forceful approach, but it is
not a passive one.”</p>
<p>Current Harris aides have told VOA that she intends to stay on the
path that Biden has laid out: working beyond a cease-fire toward a
two-state solution without sacrificing Israel’s security.</p>
<p>Harris’ former national security adviser while she was in the Senate,
Halie Soifer, agreed.</p>
<p>“The vice president and the president have supported U.S. military
assistance to Israel, not just for the existing agreement that we have
with Israel,” said Soifer, who is now the CEO of the Jewish Democratic
Council of America. “But also an increase this year because of their
security needs,” she told VOA</p>
<p>Generational and personal background</p>
<p>Biden’s generation, with a more visceral sense of the Holocaust,
views Israel as a tiny democracy surrounded by hostile Arab powers.
People of Harris’ generation and younger see Israel for what it is
today: a thriving democracy and the region’s top military power. While
Biden and Harris may share the same goal for Israel’s security, there’s
not the same emotional resonance, Rynhold said.</p>
<p>Younger Americans “don’t remember a time when Jews and Israel were
extremely vulnerable,” he said. “So they don’t have a same sense of that
continuing vulnerability that President Biden really has.”</p>
<p>And for the president, Israel is integral to the story of America’s
role in the world.</p>
<p>“America is there to prevent the Holocaust. America is there to
support democracies, and Israel is central to his way of understanding
that role,” Rynhold said.</p>
<p>If elected, Harris would become the first person to hold the highest
office in the land whose parents are both immigrants. Barack Obama’s
father was born in Kenya, and Donald Trump’s mother was born in the U.K.
Harris’ father came from Jamaica and her mother, from India.</p>
<p>Unlike Biden, who often underscores that he is a Zionist, a loaded
term often viewed with scorn in many parts of the world, Harris may be
more sensitive to views from the Global South.</p>
<p>In a 2018 speech to an Indian American group, Harris spoke fondly of
childhood visits to the home of her maternal grandfather, P.V. Gopalan,
describing him as someone who had fought for “freedom and for justice
and for independence.”</p>
<p>“She is aware of how the rest of the world may feel about the Middle
East, about neocolonialism, neoimperialism,” Hall said. “I really hope
that she has the opportunity to bring those experiences to bear if she
becomes the president.”</p>
<p>But it’s hard to tell what a Harris doctrine would eventually look
like.</p>
<p>“What she says now is directed to winning an election and keeping the
Democratic Party together,” Rynhold said.</p>
<p>And since the party is evenly split between those sympathetic to
Israel and those sympathetic to the Palestinians, she must express
platitudes, he said.</p>
<p>“And that’s what she has done.”</p>

<h2 id="pg-failover-slots-1.1.0-released">PG Failover Slots 1.1.0
Released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-28, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<h3>
PG Failover Slots 1.1.0 Released
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com">EDB</a> is pleased to announce
the release of PG Failover Slots (pg_failover_slots) 1.1.0. This release
includes support for the upcoming PostgreSQL 17, bug fixes, and
additional configuration options. You can find PG Failover Slots on
<a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/pg_failover_slots">GitHub</a>,
where you will also find the latest
<a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/pg_failover_slots/releases">Release
notes</a>. PG Failover Slots is open-source software under the
<a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/pg_failover_slots?tab=License-1-ov-file#readme">PostgreSQL
license</a>.
</p>
<p>
Designed for users with logical replication publications on Postgres
databases that are part of a streaming replication architecture, PG
Failover Slots avoids the need for logical replication subscribers to
reseed their logical replication tables when the logical replication
publisher is part of a physical streaming replication architecture, and
a new standby gets promoted to primary.
</p>
<p>
Since the replication slot used by logical replication is only
maintained on the primary node, downstream subscribers will not receive
any new changes from the newly promoted primary until the slot is
created. Picking up logical replication changes from the newly promoted
standby is unsafe because the information that includes which data a
subscriber has confirmed receiving and which log data still needs to be
retained for the subscriber will have been lost, resulting in an unknown
gap in data.
</p>
<p>
PG Failover Slots makes logical replication slots usable across a
physical failover via the following features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Copies any missing replication slots from the primary to the standby
</li>
<li>
Removes any slots from the standby that aren’t found on the primary
</li>
<li>
Periodically synchronizes the position of slots on the standby based on
the primary
</li>
<li>
Ensures that selected standbys receive data before any of the logical
slot walsenders can send data to consumers
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-myth-of-perfect-metadata-matching">The myth of perfect
metadata matching</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-28, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
In our previous instalments of the blog series about matching (see
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/metadata-matching-101-what-is-it-and-why-do-we-need-it/">part
1</a> and
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-anatomy-of-metadata-matching/">part
2</a>), we explained what metadata matching is, why it is important and
described its basic terminology. In this entry, we will discuss a few
common beliefs about metadata matching that are often encountered when
interacting with users, developers, integrators, and other stakeholders.
Spoiler alert: we are calling them myths because these beliefs are not
true! Read on to learn why.
</p>
<p>
If you have stuck with us this far in our series, hopefully, you are at
least a bit excited about the possibility of creating new relationships
between the works, authors, institutions, preprints, datasets, and
myriad other objects in our existing scholarly metadata. Who would not
want all of these to be better connected?
</p>
<p>
We have to pause for a moment and be honest with you: metadata matching
is a complex problem, and doing it correctly requires significant
effort. What is worse, even if we do everything right, our matching
won’t be perfect. This may be counterintuitive. Perhaps you’ve heard
that matching is not a hard problem, or have encountered people
surprised that a matching strategy returned a wrong or incomplete
answer. Sometimes, it is obvious to a person from looking at some
specific example that a match should (or should not) have been made, so
they naturally assume that a change to account for this has to be
simple.
</p>
<p>
Misconceptions like these can be problematic. They create confusion
around matching, drive users’ expectations to unreasonable levels, and
make people drastically underestimate the effort needed to build and
integrate matching strategies. So let’s dive right in and debunk a few
common myths about metadata matching.
</p>
<h2 id="myth-1-a-metadata-matching-strategy-should-be-100-correct">
Myth #1: A metadata matching strategy should be 100% correct
</h2>
<p>
Anyone who has built or supported a matching strategy has likely
encountered the following belief: it is possible to develop a perfect
strategy, meaning one that always returns the correct results, no matter
the inputs. The unfortunate truth is that while one’s aim should always
be to design matching strategies that return correct results, once we
move beyond the simplest class of problems or artificially clean data,
no strategy can achieve this outcome. In thinking through why this is
the case, some inherent constraints become obvious:
</p>
<p>
The inputs to matching are often strings in human-readable formats,
which can vary wildly in their structure, order and completeness. Since
they’re intended to be parsed by people, instead of machines, they’re
inherently lossy and frequently unstructured, anticipating that a person
can infer from the source context what is being referenced. Matching
strategies, although built to make sense of unstructured data,
unfortunately, don’t have the luxury of this flexibility. A strategy has
to account for translating a messy, partial, or inconsistent input into
a correct and structured match.
</p>
<p>
Consider, for example, the following inputs to an affiliation matching
strategy:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
“Department of Radiology, St. Mary’s Hospital, London W2 1NY, UK”
</li>
<li>
“Saint Mary’s Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust”
</li>
<li>
“St. Mary’s Medical Center, San Francisco, CA”
</li>
<li>
“St Mary’s Hosp., Dublin”
</li>
<li>
“St Mary’s Hospital Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust”
</li>
<li>
“聖マリア病院”
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In order to correctly identify the organisations mentioned here, the
matching strategy must be able to distinguish between different ways of
representing the same institution, disambiguate multiple institutions
that have similar names, and handle variant forms for the parts of each
name (Saint/St./St), identify the same name in different languages
(“聖マリア病院” is Japanese for “St. Mary’s Hospital”), and make
assumptions about partial or ambiguous locations translating to more
precise references. While a person reviewing each of these strings might
be able to accomplish these tasks, even here there are some challenges.
Does “St Mary’s Hosp., Dublin” refer to the hospital in Ireland or a
separate hospital in one of the many cities that share this name? Should
we presume that because “聖マリア病院” is in Japanese, this refers to a
hospital in Japan? Would someone, by default, be aware that St. Mary’s
Hospital in London is part of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust,
such that inputs one and five refer to the same organisation?
</p>
<p>
An additional challenge lies in the quality of the data, which in the
context of matching, encompasses both the input and the dataset being
matched against. In real world circumstances, no dataset is fully
accurate, complete, or current and certainly not all three. As a result,
there will always be functionally random differences between inputs to
the strategy and the entities to be matched. A theoretically perfect
matching strategy would thus need to distinguish between inconsequential
discrepancies resulting from gaps, errors, and variable forms of
reference and actual, meaningful differences indicating an incorrect
match. As one might imagine, this would require near total knowledge of
the meaning and context for all inputs and outputs, a nigh-on impossible
task for any person or system!
</p>
<p>
As a consequence, no metadata matching strategy will ever be perfect. It
is unreasonable for us to expect them to be. This does not mean, of
course, that all strategies are equally flawed or destined to forever
return middling results. Some are better than others and we can improve
them over time. Which brings us to the next myth:
</p>
<h2 id="myth-2-it-is-always-a-good-idea-to-adapt-the-matching-strategy-to-a-specific-input">
Myth #2: It is always a good idea to adapt the matching strategy to a
specific input
</h2>
<p>
Matching strategies are not static. They can - and should - be improved.
There is, however, a deceptive trap that one can fall into when
attempting to improve a matching strategy. Whenever we encounter an
incorrect or missing result for a specific input, we treat this problem
like a software bug and try to adapt the strategy to work better for it,
without considering all other cases.
</p>
<p>
The more complicated reality is that the quality of matching results is
controlled through a complex set of trade-offs between
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall" target="_blank">precision
and recall</a> that determine the kind and number of relationships
created between items:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Precision is calculated as the number of correctly matched relationships
resulting from a strategy, divided by the total number of matched
relationships. It can also be interpreted as the probability that a
match is correct. Low precision indicates a high rate of false
positives, which are incorrect relationships created by the strategy.
</li>
<li>
Recall is calculated as the number of correctly matched relationships
resulting from a strategy, divided by the number of true (expected)
relationships. It can also be interpreted as the probability that a true
(correct) relationship will be created by the strategy. Low recall means
a high rate of false negatives, which are relationships that should have
been created by the strategy but were not made.
</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:center;margin:10px">
<figure class="img-responsive">
<img src="https://www.crossref.org/images/blog/2024/false-positives-negatives.png"
alt="False positives and false negatives" width="75%">
<figcaption>
<p>
The diagram depicts false negatives and false positives. The ideal
outcome would be that the ellipses are identical, matched relationships
are exactly the same as true relationships, and there are no false
negatives or false positives. In practice, we try to make the
intersection as big as possible.
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>
The tradeoff between precision and recall roughly means that modifying
the strategy to improve recall will decrease precision, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
Imagine, for example, we received a report about a relationship that was
missed by matching because of a partial, noisy, or ambiguous input. We
might be tempted to resolve this issue by relaxing our matching
criteria. Unfortunately, this will have a cost of a higher overall rate
of false positive matches.
</p>
<p>
Conversely, if we encounter a case where the matching has returned an
incorrect match, we might attempt to make the matching strategy stricter
to avoid this result. We should remember, however, that this may have
the consequence of causing the strategy to skip many perfectly valid
matches.
</p>

<p>

prioritises precision over recall resulting in more false negatives. (b)
A relaxed strategy prioritises recall over precision resulting in more
false positives.
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>
Striking this balance becomes even more difficult when attempting to
address multiple issues at once, or considering constraints like the
time and resources consumed by each aspect of the strategy. Each choice
can compound the individual effects in unanticipated and expensive ways.
The aim of matching ultimately then can’t be to achieve perfect results
for every single case. Fixing one particular situation might not be
desirable, as it can result in breaking multiple other cases. Instead,
we have to find a locally optimal balance that optimises the strategy’s
utility, relative to these inherent limitations. This means accepting
some level of imperfection as not just inevitable, but necessary for
implementing a workable strategy. When you consider all this, you might
conclude that…
</p>
<h2 id="myth-3-we-shouldnt-do-large-scale-unsupervised-matching">
Myth #3: We shouldn’t do large-scale, unsupervised matching
</h2>
<p>
Imperfect matching strategies, when applied automatically to real-world
large datasets, might:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Fail to discover some relationships (false negatives), an outcome that
may not be terribly problematic. In the worst case scenario, we have
wasted a great deal of effort developing matching strategies that do not
improve our metadata.
</li>
<li>
Create incorrect relationships between items (false positives), what
seems like a potentially larger problem, where we have added incorrect
relationships to the metadata.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Many have the instinct to avoid false positives at any cost, even if
this means missing many additional correct relationships at the same
time. They might come to the conclusion that if we cannot have 100%
precision (see our previous myth), we simply should not allow matching
strategies to act in an automated, unsupervised way on large datasets.
While there might be circumstances where this belief is rational, in the
context of the scholarly record, this notion is seriously flawed.
</p>
<p>
First, if you are dealing with any medium to large-sized dataset, it
almost certainly contains errors, even before you apply any automated
processing to it. Even if data is submitted and curated by users, they
can still make mistakes, and might themselves be using automated tools
for extracting the data from other sources, without your knowledge. It
is thus not entirely obvious that applying an (imperfect) matching
strategy to create more relationships would actually make the data
quality worse.
</p>
<p>
Second, while we cannot eliminate all matching errors, we can place a
high priority on precision when developing strategies, with the aim of
keeping the number of incorrectly matched results as low as possible. We
can also make use of additional mechanisms to easily correct for
incorrectly matched results, for example doing so manually, in response
to error reports.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the results of matching should always contain provenance
information to distinguish them from those that have been manually
curated. This way, the users can make their own decisions about whether
to use and trust the matching results, relative to their use case.
</p>
<p>
By applying those additional checks, we can minimise the negative
effects of incorrect matching, while at the same time reap the benefits
of filling gaps in the scholarly record.
</p>
<h2 id="myth-4-we-can-only-ever-guess-at-the-accuracy-of-our-matching-results">
Myth #4: We can only ever guess at the accuracy of our matching results
</h2>
<p>
In attempting to determine the correctness of our matching, we
immediately encounter a number of inherent limitations. The sheer amount
of entries in many datasets prevents a thorough, manual validation of
the results, but if instead, we use too few or specific items as our
benchmarks, these are unlikely to be representative of overall
performance. The unpredictable nature of future data adds another
wrinkle: will our matching always be as successful as when we first
benchmarked it or will its performance degrade relative to some change
in the data?
</p>
<p>
With so many unknowns, are we then doomed? No! We have rigorous and
scientific tools at our disposal that can help us estimate how accurate
our matching will be. How do we use them? Well, that is a big and fairly
technical topic, so we will leave you with this little cliffhanger. See
you in the next post!

<h2 id="what-it-takes-to-run-the-witcher-3-on-risc-v">What it takes to
run The Witcher 3 on RISC-V</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Box64 project, which allows you to run Linux x86-64 binaries on
non-x86 architectures like ARM and RISC-V, has achieved a major
milestone with its RISC-V backend. It’s been over a year since our last
update on the state of the RISC-V backend, and we recently successfully
ran The Witcher 3 on an RISC-V PC, which I believe is the first AAA game
ever to run on an RISC-V machine. So I thought this would be a perfect
time to write an update, and here it comes. ↫ Box86/Box64 blog Calling
this a monumental achievement would be underselling it. Just in case you
understand how complex running The Witcher 3 on RISC-V really is:
they’re running a Windows x86 game on Linux on RISC-V using Box64, Wine,
and DXVK. This was only made possible relatively recently due to more
and more x86 instructions making their way into RISC-V, as well as newer
RISC-V machines that can accept modern graphics cards. The Witcher 3 can
runs at about 15 frame per second in-game, using the 64-core RISC-V
processor in the Milk-V Pioneer combined with an AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT
GPU. That may not sound like much, but considering the complexity
underpinning even running this game at all in this environment it’s
actually kind of amazing. It seems Box64 could become as important to
gaming on ARM and RISC-V Linux as Wine and Proton were for gaming x86
Linux. There’s still a lot more work to be done, and the linked article
details a number of x86 instructions that are particularly important for
x86 emulation, but are not available on RISC-V. The end result is that
RISC-V has to run multiple instructions to emulate a single x86
instruction (“a whole of 10 instructions for a simple byte add”), which
obviously affects performance.</p>

<p>Microsoft is handing over the Mono project to WineHQ, which came as a
bit of a surprise announcement today. We are happy to announce that the
WineHQ organization will be taking over as the stewards of the Mono
Project upstream at wine-mono/Mono · GitLab (winehq.org). Source code in
existing mono/mono and other repos will remain available, although repos
may be archived. Binaries will remain available for up to four years.
Microsoft maintains a modern fork of Mono runtime in the dotnet/runtime
repo and has been progressively moving workloads to that fork. That work
is now complete, and we recommend that active Mono users and maintainers
of Mono-based app frameworks migrate to .NET which includes work from
this fork. ↫ Mono’s website Wine make use of Mono, so this seems like a
natural home for the project. Mono is an open source implementation of
Microsoft’s .NET, and is available on a wide variety of platforms, but
lately it’s been languishing a bit, with no major release since 2019,
and only small patches since then. Microsoft gained stewardship over the
Mono project when it acquired Xamarin in 2016.</p>

updating FreeBSD, but a lot faster</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>This is freebsd-rustdate, a reimplementation of freebsd-update. It’s
primarily written because of how slow freebsd-update is, and is written
in rust because I felt like it. In usage, it’s expected to be similar,
but not identical to freebsd-update. There are probably a number of
minor edge-case differences I don’t even know about, but there are a
number of larger ones that are intentional too. ↫ Matthew Fuller I love
it when someone takes on a very well-established tool that’s used by
countless people who probably barely think about how it could be
improved. In this case, the performance improvements are nothing short
of extraordinary, but of course, its author Matthew Fuller rightfully
points out that you really shouldn’t be using this on any production
system. It has not received even one percent of the kind of testing and
eyeballs that the regular update tool in FreeBSD has received, so there
may be edge cases or bugs. Improving the speed of the update process is
always welcome. If it’s slow and time-consuming, people might postpone
the updates because they’re getting in the way of what they want to do
at the moment. Sure, I doubt the average FreeBSD user is the kind of
person to postpone updates and run an insecure system in the meantime,
but it might still draw a few people across the line to quickly get them
done before continuing their work. This new rust-based FreeBSD update
tool is definitely not going to be replacing the current one any time
soon, nor is it even a part of the FreeBSD project in the first place,
so there’s no need to worry about any potential breakage to your FreeBSD
system because they’re replacing a battle-tested tool with a new one.
All this does for now is highlight that there’s gains to be made here,
and that’s a goal worth pursuing.</p>

id="us-urges-certain-negative-actors-not-to-fuel-sudans-civil-war">US
urges certain ‘negative actors’ not to fuel Sudan’s civil war</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States is urging certain foreign nations not
to fuel Sudan’s civil war by arming fighting factions, as the country
faces one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington has also called on Sudan’s warring sides to
enforce a code of conduct to reduce abuses, noting that the army is
considering the proposal after its rival paramilitary forces have agreed
to it.</p>
<p>More than 25 million people face acute hunger and more than 10
million have been displaced from their homes since fighting erupted in
April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF, and the
paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, the State Department
said.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we’ve seen a significant proliferation of the number
of external actors that are playing a role on both sides,” and they are
not putting the interest of the Sudanese people “at the core of this,”
said Tom Perriello, U.S. special envoy for Sudan.</p>
<p>“In addition to UAE [the United Arab Emirates] supporting the RSF,”
Perriello told reporters on Tuesday, “we see foreign fighters coming in
from across the Sahel. We’ve seen Iran, Russia, other negative actors on
the SAF side.”</p>
<p>U.S.-brokered peace talks on Sudan that concluded last week in Geneva
failed to end the country’s 16-month conflict. But one of the warring
sides, the RSF, agreed to a code of conduct pledging to avoid violence
against women, exploitation at checkpoints and the destruction of
crops.</p>
<p>Perriello said that the U.S. has presented the proposal to the SAF
leaders who were absent in the Switzerland negotiations.</p>
<p>“They have the code of conduct in front of them. We hope to get a
response from them in the coming days,” Perriello said.</p>
<p>The United States has accused the SAF and RSF of war crimes, with the
RSF specifically charged with ethnic cleansing and crimes against
humanity targeting the indigenous African-origin people of Darfur.</p>
<p>During the talks in Geneva, the U.S., along with representatives from
the African Union, the United Arab Emirates, the United Nations, Egypt,
Saudi Arabia and Switzerland, focused on reopening three humanitarian
corridors — the Western border crossing in Darfur at Adre, the northern
Dabbah Road from Port Sudan and the southern access route through
Sennar.</p>
<p>Later this week, the U.S. will have a first formal follow-up with the
heads of delegations.</p>
<p>Humanitarian assistance deliveries have resumed via two of the three
routes: across the border at Adre from Chad and along the Dabbah Road
into famine-stricken areas of Sudan.</p>
<p>In a statement late Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
welcomed the reopening of humanitarian corridors, saying lack of
humanitarian aid access into Darfur over the past six months has
exacerbated the historic levels of famine and acute hunger across Sudan,
particularly within the Zamzam camp.</p>

id="special-counsel-files-new-indictment-in-trump-jan.-6-case">Special
counsel files new indictment in Trump Jan. 6 case</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Special counsel Jack Smith filed a new indictment
Tuesday against Donald Trump over his efforts to undo the 2020
presidential election. The indictment keeps the same criminal charges
but narrows the allegations against him following a Supreme Court
opinion that conferred broad immunity on former presidents.</p>
<p>The new indictment removes a section of the indictment that had
accused Trump of trying to use the law enforcement powers of the Justice
Department to overturn his election loss, an area of conduct for which
the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 opinion last month, said that Trump was
absolutely immune from prosecution.</p>
<p>The stripped-down criminal case represents a first effort by
prosecutors to comply with a Supreme Court opinion likely to result in a
significant revision of the allegations against Trump over his efforts
to block the peaceful transfer of power. It was filed three days ahead
of a deadline for prosecutors and defense lawyers to tell the judge in
the case how they wanted to proceed in light of that opinion, which said
former presidents are presumptively immune from prosecution for official
White House acts.</p>
<p>The two sides will be back in court for a status hearing next week,
the first such appearance in months given that the case had been
effectively frozen since last December as Trump’s immunity appeal worked
its way through the justice system.</p>
<p>In a statement on his Truth Social platform, Trump called the new
indictment “an act of desperation” and an “effort to resurrect a ‘dead’
Witch Hunt.’” He said the new case has “all the problems of the old
Indictment, and should be dismissed IMMEDIATELY.”</p>
<p>The special counsel’s office said the updated indictment, filed in
federal court in Washington, was issued by a grand jury that had not
previously heard evidence in the case. It said in a statement that the
indictment “reflects the Government’s efforts to respect and implement
the Supreme Court’s holdings and remand instructions.”</p>
<p>The central revision in the updated criminal case concerns Trump’s
dealings with the Justice Department.</p>
<p>The original indictment included allegations that Trump tried to
enlist the department in his failed effort to undo his election loss,
including by conducting sham investigations and telling states —
incorrectly — that significant fraud had been detected.</p>
<p>It detailed how Jeffrey Clark, a top official in the Trump Justice
Department, wanted to send a letter to elected officials in certain
states falsely claiming that the department had “identified significant
concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election” and had
asked top department officials to sign it, but they refused.</p>
<p>Clark’s support for Trump’s election fraud claims led Trump to openly
contemplate naming him as acting attorney general in place of Jeffrey
Rosen, who led the department in the final weeks of the Trump
administration. Trump ultimately relented in that idea “when he was told
it would result in mass resignations at the Justice Department,”
according to the original indictment. Rosen remained on as acting
attorney general through the end of Trump’s tenure</p>
<p>The new case no longer references Clark as a co-conspirator. Trump’s
co-conspirators were not named in either indictment, but they have been
identified through public records and other means.</p>
<p>In its opinion, the Supreme Court held that a president’s
interactions with the Justice Department constitute official acts for
which he is entitled to immunity, effectively stripping those
allegations from the case.</p>
<p>“As we have explained, the President’s power to remove ‘executive
officers of the United States whom he has appointed’ may not be
regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts,” Chief Justice John
Roberts wrote for the court.</p>
<p>The justices returned other core allegations in the case to U.S.
District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the trial judge presiding over the case,
to determine what constitutes an official act protected from
prosecution.</p>
<p>The new indictment still includes one of the more stunning
allegations brought by Smith — that Trump participated in a scheme
orchestrated by allies to enlist slates of fraudulent electors in
battleground states won by Democrat Joe Biden who would falsely attest
that Trump had won in those states.</p>
<p>It also retains allegations that Trump sought to pressure Vice
President Mike Pence to reject legitimate electoral votes, and that
Trump and his allies exploited the chaos at the Capitol on Jan. 6 in an
attempt to further delay the certification of Biden’s victory.</p>
<p>Roberts wrote in his majority opinion that the interactions between
Trump and Pence amounted to official conduct for which “Trump is at
least presumptively immune from prosecution.”</p>
<p>The question, Roberts wrote, is whether the government can rebut
“that presumption of immunity.”</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The American EV market has seen its fair share of tumult this year —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-ev-suv-canceled" target="_self"><u>Ford
canceled its three-row SUV</u></a>,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-2#:~:text=The%20electric%2Dcar%20maker%20has,to%20independently%20confirm%20Reuters'%20reporting." target="_self"><u>Tesla
canceled its $25,000 mass-market EV,</u></a> and EV sales growth
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62063#:~:text=Hybrid%20vehicles%2C%20plug%2Din%20hybrid,to%20estimates%20from%20Wards%20Intelligence." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dropped
sharply</u></a> in the first quarter. But from all this darkness, a
glimmer of hope has emerged: The market for hybrids is surging.
</p>
<p>
Electric and hybrid vehicle sales made up 18.7% of all new light-duty
vehicles sold in the second quarter of this year,
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62924" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to new data</u></a> from Wards Intelligence analyzed by the Energy
Information Administration. That’s up from 17.8% in the first three
months of the year.
</p>
<p>
This increase was “driven primarily” by hybrid sales, according to Wards
and the EIA, which grew almost 31% from 2023 and made up almost 10% of
light-duty sales in the second quarter. Sales of plug-in hybrids grew,
as well, while the battery electric vehicle share of the market was
about flat compared to the second quarter of last year.
</p>
<p>
The trend appears to be continuing into the back half of the year. In
July, hybrid sales were up about 23% in the U.S. compared to July of
last year, and the gap between hybrid and electric sales grew, according
to data from Morgan Stanley.
</p>
<p>
“A lot of the EV slowdown we’ve seen has been really pronounced in the
first quarter of this year given Tesla’s performance,” Corey Cantor, an
EV analyst at BloombergNEF, told me. “A lot of that story at a macro
level is Tesla taking a step back.”
</p>
<p>
To recap: Elon Musk’s company has not
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-robotaxi" target="_blank">refreshed
much of its existing model lineup</a> in several years and is now facing
increasing competition overseas from Chinese automakers, plus basically
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chevy-equinox-ev" target="_blank">every
other automaker</a> in the United States market. It also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-layoffs" target="_blank">gutted
the team</a> behind its Supercharger network — regarded by observers as
one of its biggest differentiators — even as its peers have largely
adopted Tesla’s own charging standard. While Tesla used to dominate U.S.
EV sales, it no longer makes up even half the domestic market; the
estimated 53,000 vehicles Tesla sold in July represented 48% of all EV
sales that month, according to Morgan Stanley.
</p>
<p>
But the travails of one very prominent electric car company aren’t the
whole story, and exactly why hybrid sales have been so strong is not
exactly clear. Gasoline prices are well off their recent 2022 highs as
well as their 2008 recent peak when adjusted for wages. One reason may
be that the increased prevalence of battery electric vehicles may have
normalized hybrid sales, as hybrids are no longer the most “green-coded’
type of vehicle. (To wit: The “Smug Alert!”
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0783418/" target="_blank"><u>episode
of <em>South Park</em></u></a> aired in March 2006.)
</p>
<p>
The other reason may be far simpler: cost. Cantor cited Edmunds data
showing that in April of this year, even when you throw out Tesla and
other direct sellers, hybrids’ average transaction price was about
$44,000 compared to $59,000 for battery electric.
</p>
<p>
“EVs still have a long way to go,” Cantor said. “Hybrids are an
attractive option not only because of normalization, but also a lot of
them are pretty affordable.” This is especially true for the biggest
player in hybrid vehicles, Toyota: A 2024 Corolla hybrid will cost
between about $23,500 and $28,500,
<a href="https://www.edmunds.com/toyota/corolla-hybrid/" target="_blank"><u>according
to Edmunds</u></a>, while a standard Corolla goes for between $22,000
and $27,000.
</p>
<p>
This combination of higher prices and slacking demand for BEVs explains
why Ford canceled its three-row BEV SUV, according to Morgan Stanley
analyst Adam Jonas in a note to clients. “Ford scaled back and delayed
its EV strategy to match consumer demand (slower) and costs (still too
high).”
</p>
<p>
But what may be most affordable for drivers may not be ideal for the
planet.
</p>
<p>
While standard hybrids have lower lifetime emissions than internal
combustion vehicles, annual greenhouse gas emissions from hybrids are
about two-and-a-half times those of battery electric vehicles,
<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric-emissions" target="_blank"><u>according
to the Department of Energy</u></a>. And, Cantor noted, cars bought
today will likely be on the road for around 10 years.
</p>
<p>
“Hybrids can’t be the long-term climate solution. They don’t do enough
to mitigate emissions,” Cantor said. “To meet climate targets you’re
looking all-electric by the mid 2030s.”

The United States
<a href="https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review/resources-and-data-downloads" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>produces</u></a>
more natural gas and crude oil than any other country ― it isn’t even a
contest. But these
“<a href="https://time.com/5597784/freedom-gas-energy-department/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>molecules
of U.S. freedom</u></a>” aren’t free: They’re extracted and transported
through a network of rigs, drills, pumps, and pipes that are,
increasingly, controlled and operated by myriad private equity
companies. As a society, we have a strong interest in winding down these
climate-polluting assets in a swift yet orderly fashion. But as
businesses, their private equity owners don’t.
</p>
<p>
Over the past decade, pressure from shareholders and activists has
succeeded in pushing many fossil fuel majors to consider how best to
reduce their emissions. (Although that, too, has
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/judge-tosses-exxon-mobil-lawsuit-against-activist-shareholder-arjuna-over-climate-proposal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>come
at a cost</u></a>.) But rather than winding down or cleaning up their
most polluting and least profitable assets, many have instead simply
<a href="https://bioneers.org/fossil-fuel-companies-greenwashing-indicates-they-should-be-publicly-owned-kate-aronoff-ztvz2208/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>divested</u></a>.
Coal companies in West Virginia have sold off their mines to
<a href="https://www.desmog.com/2020/06/25/coal-surety-bond-pools-liabilities-mine-cleanup/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>undercapitalized</u></a>
vulture firms, which rely on continued coal
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/business/dealbook/regulators-fear-1-billion-coal-cleanup-bill.html?_r=0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sales</u></a>
to (in theory) pay for expensive environmental remediation costs. The
same is happening in the oil and gas industry, where
<a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/private-profits-public-risks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>private
equity</u></a> firms have rolled up many of the drilling sites and
pipelines, the capillaries and veins of the country’s energy
infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Shielded from the scrutiny of public markets, private equity funds have
thus become some of the country’s
<a href="https://pestakeholder.org/news/private-equity-drives-methane-pollution/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>top
methane emitters</u></a> by asset ownership in the natural gas sector.
These opaque owners, capitalizing on other companies’ disinterest in
holding high-emitting assets, are
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a67d5fd1-cc9d-4187-9b2a-3851b7cf8944" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>betting</u></a>
that fossil fuel infrastructure will keep paying out for quite some
time; recent massive increases in expected energy demand have only
<a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Consolidation-Wave-in-US-Oil-and-Gas-is-Big-Boon-for-Private-Equity.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>juiced</u></a>
this trend toward industry
<a href="https://www.enverus.com/newsroom/upstream-ma-sails-on-with-30-billion-in-2q24/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>consolidation</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Private equity firms and private debt funds, with their short-term
profit horizons, concealed balance sheets, and seeming
<a href="https://lpeproject.org/blog/private-financial-markets-are-eating-the-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">imperviousness</a>
to tighter financial regulation and shareholder activism, work well with
fossil fuel assets, particularly those sold at fire-sale prices by
publicly traded fossil fuel majors. Despite those assets’ long-term
market value instability, their near-term cash flow prospects are what
matter.
</p>
<p>
But what’s been good for fossil fuel majors’ balance sheets has been bad
for the planet. Many of these buyout firms — well-capitalized private
equity funds and scrappy vulture funds, alike — are not
<a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/private-profits-public-risks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>budgeting</u></a>
anywhere near enough for environmental remediation. One company,
Diversified Energy Co, has been
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-14/it-pays-to-not-pay-your-debts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>purchasing</u></a>
the rights to operate almost-depleted natural gas wellheads
<a href="https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/media/press-releases/ec-democrats-demand-answers-diversified-energy-over-concerning-environmental" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
scale</u></a>, extending many of their lifespans by
<em><em>decades</em></em>; far too few wellheads are closed each year to
stem the methane spewing unimpeded into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
Rather than accept a situation where utilities and fossil fuel majors
toss their liabilities to unaccountable vulture funds,
sustainability-conscious investors and shareholder groups have begun
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/investors-pushed-mining-giants-to-quit-coal-now-it-s-backfiring" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>screening</u></a>
transactions for responsible asset phaseout plans. But the lack of a
binding set of transition standards has revealed a huge coordination
problem: What counts as a responsible phaseout, particularly when
private asset owners get to decide? The federal government has put down
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/NetZeroPrinciples.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>guidelines</u></a>,
but not its foot. A disorganized drawdown of assets under a patchy
regulatory framework, without a doubt,

</p>
<p>
Progressive analysts have
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/7/11875978/coal-industry-buyout%5C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>long</u></a>
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/156941/moderate-proposal-nationalize-fossil-fuel-industry%5C" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>argued</u></a>
that nationalizing fossil fuel assets and folding them into a state
holding company is the best solution to sidestep this particular
problem. The federal government is well staffed with energy and
electricity experts who, operating under a public mandate to preserve
grid reliability, can phase out fossil fuel assets on a unified,
coherent timeline responsive to community needs while continuing to
operate those assets as the “peaker” or “reserve” capacity required to
ensure grid stability. A series of climate shocks has even
<a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/178918/dan-patrick-texas-socialize-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>convinced</u></a>
conservative leaders in Texas of the importance of public power for grid
resilience, achieved through state ownership of “peaker” gas plants.
This course of action is far worse than investments in, say, battery
capacity ― California, for instance, is now
<a href="https://reneweconomy.com.au/battery-storage-is-dramatically-reshaping-the-california-grid-and-finally-moving-it-away-from-gas/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reaping</u></a>
the benefits of
<a href="https://blog.gridstatus.io/caiso-batteries-apr-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>massive</u></a>
battery deployment, which reduces the state’s need for gas ― but the
logic behind building public reserve capacity is sound.
</p>
<p>
What advocates of a state holding company-type model do not often
discuss is how exactly a government goes about acquiring all these
soon-to-be-stranded fossil fuel assets. As just one example, a
<a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RI_Green-Industrial-Policy-Fossil-Fuels_Report_072024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
proposal</u></a> from the Roosevelt Institute suggests that a state
holding company should be “free to engage in debt financing, make equity
investments, and acquire assets.” Sure, proposals like these are meant
to buttress the case for why nationalization is a far better way to
achieve a managed phaseout than surrendering that process to
yield-seeking investors, not to detail the financial mechanics of a
buyout. But still: this is vague!
</p>
<p>
Actually thinking through the specifics suggests that, interestingly
enough, a comprehensive state-led buyout program could work a lot like
an existing private equity transaction, for two key reasons.
</p>
<p>
Before we get there, we should separate private equity’s deserved
reputation as an opaque asset owner from the way the industry works.
Private equity’s calling card, the “leveraged buyout,” is little more
than the act of raising debt to 1) purchase equity in and, therefore,
ownership over an asset, and 2) refinance the asset’s liabilities. To do
so, private equity funds work with banks or, more commonly these days,
private debt or private credit funds, to raise debt that is generally
backed by the combined assets of the purchaser firm and purchased asset.
</p>
<p>
But leveraged buyouts themselves are technically something that
<em><em>any</em></em> financial institution could do. Take the federal
government, the country’s most liquid debt issuer, whose debt anchors
the global economy and backstops private financial institutions. It
could raise debt (leverage) to finance a buyout of fossil fuel assets at
interest rates far lower than private investors could. And because
private credit funds, like other institutional investors, already buy
loads of government bonds to match their liabilities and hedge their
risks, this kind of nationwide leveraged buyout ― which would require
substantial new debt issuance ― could actually help
<a href="https://advaitarun.wordpress.com/2023/05/31/a-public-option-for-public-finance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stabilize</u></a>
the financial system against
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-06/private-credit-funds-with-no-skin-in-game-a-worry-credit-weekly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>potential
shocks</u></a> from within notoriously
<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2024/04/08/fast-growing-USD2-trillion-private-credit-market-warrants-closer-watch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>inscrutable</u></a>
private markets. The government can do exactly what private equity does,
only a lot better, and with wider benefits.
</p>
<p>
The government has already planted the seeds of a leveraged buyout
program across the country’s coal ash heaps. The Loan Programs Office,
thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction
Act, now
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/program-guidance-title-17-clean-energy-program#page=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offers</u></a>
far-below-market-rate loan guarantees to developers, including state
governments and utility companies, seeking to repurpose fossil fuel
assets through its Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment program. This
program’s
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/lpo/articles/program-guidance-title-17-clean-energy-program#page=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>authority</u></a>
allows borrowers to use their financing for “refinancing outstanding
indebtedness directly associated with eligible Energy Infrastructure.”
All policymakers have to do now is scrap the program’s
<a href="https://rmi.org/the-energy-infrastructure-reinvestment-program-federal-financing-for-an-equitable-clean-economy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2026
end date</u></a> and, ideally, endow a federal institution with the
power to borrow from this authority to purchase and refinance fossil
fuel assets, rather than leave that task solely in the hands of state
governments and utilities, with their varying capacities for and
interest in coordinating a coherent phaseout plan. And now that interest
rates are
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/jackson-hole-interest-rates" target="_self"><u>poised</u></a>
to fall, this refinancing becomes much cheaper.
</p>
<p>
That’s reason number one. Reason number two has to do with private
equity funds’ ability to
<a href="http://bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-01/people-will-pay-for-illiquidity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shield</u></a>
the assets in their portfolio from valuation
<a href="https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Illiquidity-Discount" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>volatility</u></a>
on publicly traded stock markets. Private equity funds need not
publicize how much their portfolios are worth, except at infrequent
intervals and when they sell assets. But thanks to private equity’s
reputation as a high-return investment, fund investors
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d20a750b-9544-4927-88a4-72050c658967" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pay</u></a>
a
<a href="http://bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-01/people-will-pay-for-illiquidity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>premium</u></a>
for the
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55837df7-876f-42cd-a920-02ff74970098" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>illiquidity</u></a>
of not always knowing the value of their assets. Purchase assets, juice
returns, sell, and repeat ― this is the conventional private equity
playbook.
</p>
<p>
But macroeconomic conditions today are such that private equity
companies are now
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cf590028-d15c-4782-be2b-131fe08d703c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>struggling</u></a>

<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/079ccde6-3c3d-4791-953b-6e3e8203ef12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sell</u></a>
their portfolios.
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/55837df7-876f-42cd-a920-02ff74970098https://www.ft.com/content/55837df7-876f-42cd-a920-02ff74970098" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>High
interest rates</u></a> have made leveraged buyouts of new assets and
refinancing debts on unsold assets much more costly, and have tempered
rapid asset value growth. As this once-frenetic industry
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e33b0bcb-3ee4-4e11-9c42-f78193f90e04?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slows
down</u></a>, funds are anxious to get assets off their books ― hence
the recent wave of
<a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Consolidation-Wave-in-US-Oil-and-Gas-is-Big-Boon-for-Private-Equity.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>consolidation</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
This is an opportune moment for the Feds to step in. It’s not just that
the government’s capacity for undertaking leveraged buyouts is the
greatest; more importantly, <em><em>it never needs to sell</em></em>.
The valuation volatility that first prompts fossil fuel majors to divest
from dying, dangerous assets yet incentivizes private equity funds to
pump as much as they can out of them to resell them later at a profit is
simply not something the federal government needs to worry about. A
state holding<em> </em>company can siphon distressed assets off public
markets and shut down the
“<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0c2dfcaf-5753-43ed-a027-71c7a3b40a78" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>merry-go-round</u></a>”
of asset sales and resales.
</p>
<p>
Objections to government intervention here are likely premised on the
fact that, well, it’s the government. But the government would still be
purchasing assets from private owners on financial markets, just like
any market actor would. Today’s
<a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/climate-planning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>uncoordinated</u></a>
constellation of private fossil fuel firms and funds, on the other hand,
cannot manage a coordinated phaseout, especially not under binding
profitability constraints ― which the federal government does not share.
</p>
<p>
Local communities can’t finance phaseouts or cleanups themselves, and
leaving
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01356-y" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hundreds
of billions of dollars worth</u></a> of stranded assets in the hands of
under-regulated private firms will only accelerate climate catastrophe.
The government must use the financial techniques that private equity
funds have already pioneered to bring them to heel, in service of public
goals.

id="irans-khamenei-opens-door-to-talks-with-us-over-tehrans-nuclear-program">Iran’s
Khamenei opens door to talks with US over Tehran’s nuclear program</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dubai, UAE — Iran’s supreme leader opened the door Tuesday to renewed
negotiations with the United States over his country’s rapidly advancing
nuclear program, telling its civilian government there was “no harm” in
engaging with its “enemy.”</p>
<p>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s remarks set clear red lines for any talks
taking place under the government of reformist President Masoud
Pezeshkian and renewed his warnings that Washington wasn’t to be
trusted.</p>
<p>But his comments mirror those around the time of Iran’s 2015 nuclear
deal with world powers, which saw Tehran’s nuclear program greatly
curtailed in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Yet it
remains unclear just how much room Pezeshkian will have to maneuver, as
tensions remain high in the wider Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war
and as the U.S. prepares for a presidential election in November.</p>
<p>“This does not mean that we cannot interact with the same enemy in
certain situations,” Khamenei said, according to a transcript on his
official website.</p>
<p>Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, also warned
Pezeshkian’s Cabinet, “Do not trust the enemy.”</p>
<p>Khamenei, 85, has occasionally urged talks or dismissed them with
Washington after then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the
United States from the deal in 2018.</p>
<p>There have been indirect talks between Iran and the U.S. in recent
years mediated by Oman and Qatar, two of the United States’ Middle East
interlocutors when it comes to Iran.</p>
<p>Asked for comment, the U.S. State Department told The Associated
Press: “We will judge Iran’s leadership by their actions, not their
words.”</p>
<p>“We have long said that we ultimately view diplomacy as the best way
to achieve an effective, sustainable solution with regard to Iran’s
nuclear program,” it said. “However, we are far away from anything like
that right now given Iran’s escalations across the board, including its
nuclear escalations and its failure to cooperate” with the International
Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog.</p>
<p>Since the deal’s collapse, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put
on its program and enriches uranium to up to 60% purity — near
weapons-grade levels of 90%.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras installed by the IAEA have been disrupted, while
Iran has barred some of the Vienna-based agency’s most experienced
inspectors. Iranian officials also have increasingly threatened that
they could pursue atomic weapons.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tensions between Iran and Israel have hit a new high
during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Tehran launched an
unprecedented drone-and-missile attack on Israel in April after years of
a shadow war between the two countries reached a climax with Israel’s
apparent attack on an Iranian consular building in Syria that killed two
Iranian generals and others.</p>
<p>The assassination in Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh also
prompted Iran to threaten to retaliate against Israel.</p>
<p>Pezeshkian campaigned partly on a promise to reengage the West with
negotiations. Khamenei’s remarks as Iran’s paramount leader could
provide him with the political cover to do so.  </p>
<p>“After doing everything we can, a tactical retreat might sometimes be
necessary, but we should not abandon our goals or opinions at the first
sign of difficulty,” Khameini also said Tuesday.</p>
<p>However, it’s not just Iran that’s facing a new presidency. The U.S.
will hold a presidential election on November 5, with Vice President
Kamala Harris and Trump as the leading candidates. Iran has been
concerned about Trump’s return to power.</p>
<p>Harris, in a speech to the Democratic National Convention last week,
said: “I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to
defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed
terrorists.”</p>
<p>The RANE Network, a risk-intelligence firm, said if Harris wins, “the
likelihood of a deal will rise as the Israel-Hamas war winds down.”</p>
<p>“Once negotiations begin, Iran will likely demand more protections
regarding a potential U.S. withdrawal from a new deal after the United
States walked away from the previous deal in 2018,” RANE said in an
analysis Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s meeting between Khamenei and Pezeshkian’s Cabinet included
an appearance by former Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who
helped Iran reach the 2015 deal. After the meeting, Zarif said in an
online message that he would continue to serve as a vice president in
Pezeshkian’s administration after earlier publicly resigning over the
makeup of the Cabinet.</p>

<li>U.S. heat-related deaths on the rise

Extreme heat killed 2,325 people in America last year, the highest
number in nearly 25 years, according to a new
<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822854?guestAccessKey=53b50a89-0945-4117-a662-5e1e1484ebce&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=082624&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">study</a>
published in the journal <em><em>American Medical Association</em></em>.
The data shows 21,518 heat-related deaths since 1999, with the number of
deaths remaining steady until 2016, when they began to rise noticeably.
Last year the number surpassed 2,000 for the first time in the recorded
time period. The age-adjusted rate of heat deaths per capita has also
been rising. It stood at 0.17 deaths per 100,000 people in 2015, and
reached 0.63 last year. “As temperatures continue to rise because of
climate change, the recent increasing trend is likely to continue,” the
researchers wrote. “Local authorities in high-risk areas should consider
investing in the expansion of access to hydration centers and public
cooling centers or other buildings with air conditioning.”

yesterday it will impose 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs starting October 1
in an effort to prevent cheap cars from flooding the market and
threatening Canadian auto manufacturing. New levies might also be
applied to other clean technologies, including batteries and solar
panels, after a 30-day consultation period. “Actors like China have
chosen to give themselves an unfair advantage in the global marketplace,
compromising the security of our critical industries and displacing
dedicated Canadian autos and metal workers,” said Prime Minister Justin
Trudeau. Last year Canada imported $1.6 billion worth of Chinese EVs, up
from just $74 million in 2022,

“Ottawa is trying to position Canada as a critical part of the global EV

<li>Guterres sounds the alarm about sea level rise
</h3>
<p>
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned yesterday at
the Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting in Tonga that the “surging seas
are coming for us all.” The comments come as two new reports – from the
<a href="https://wmo.int/publication-series/state-of-climate-south-west-pacific-2023?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9rHrnH5FSWmy3AnmFy2zRnLKl-7agWd1F-SyZVUj_M9mV5NSQhd7VwyRlqB5_KYaPzCVZz" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">World

– underscore the growing threat of rising seas for coastal communities
and low-lying island nations. Oceans have risen by approximately 9
inches since 1880, and the rate of sea level rise has more than doubled
over the past 10 years, driven by melting land ice and the expansion of
sea water as it warms.
</p>
<p>
The Pacific islands are uniquely exposed, the reports say, but the
problem is global. Under a scenario in which temperatures rise by 3
degrees Celsius, by 2050 New York City, Boston, New Orleans, and
Atlantic City are all expected to see sea levels rise between 9 and 16
inches. “Across the world, around a billion people live in coastal areas
threatened by our swelling ocean,” Guterres said. “Yet even though some
sea level rise is inevitable, its scale, pace, and impact are not. That
depends on our decisions.”

You may have heard the phrase “be cool, stay in school” before. That’s a
bit hard when it’s this hot out though. More than 10,000 schools
nationwide lack air conditioning, according to the Center for Climate
Integrity. Installing ACs is costly — but so is heat’s impact on student
learning. Also on the program: We’ll look at the growing push to erase

week of US weather includes heat wave, tropical storm, landslide, flash
flood and snow</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FALCON HEIGHTS, Minn. — It’s been a wild week of weather in many
parts of the United States, from heat waves to snowstorms to flash
floods.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the weather events:</p>
<p>Midwest sizzles under heat wave</p>
<p>Millions of people in the Midwest have been enduring dangerous heat
and humidity.</p>
<p>An emergency medicine physician treating Minnesota State Fair-goers
for heat illnesses saw firefighters cut rings off two people’s swollen
fingers Monday in hot weather that combined with humidity made it feel
well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).</p>
<p>Soaring late summer temperatures also prompted some Midwestern
schools to let out early or cancel sports practices. The National
Weather Service issued heat warnings or advisories across Minnesota,
Iowa, South Dakota, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Wisconsin and
Oklahoma. Several cities including Chicago opened cooling centers.</p>
<p>Forecasters said Tuesday also will be scorching hot for areas of the
Midwest before the heat wave shifts to the south and east.</p>
<p>West Coast mountains get early snowstorm</p>
<p>An unusually cold storm on the mountain peaks along the West Coast
late last week brought a hint of winter in August. The system dropped
out of the Gulf of Alaska, down through the Pacific Northwest and into
California. Mount Rainier, southeast of Seattle, got a high-elevation
dusting, as did central Oregon’s Mt. Bachelor resort.</p>
<p>Mount Shasta, the Cascade Range volcano that rises to 14,163 feet
(4,317 meters) above far northern California, wore a white blanket after
the storm clouds passed. The mountain’s Helen Lake, which sits at 10,400
feet (3,170 meters) received about half a foot of snow (15 centimeters),
and there were greater amounts at higher elevations, according to the
U.S. Forest Service’s Shasta Ranger Station.</p>
<p>Tropical storm dumps heavy rain on Hawaii</p>
<p>Three tropical cyclones swirled over the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday,
including Tropical Storm Hone, which brought heavy rain to Hawaii;
Hurricane Gilma, which was weakening; and Tropical Storm Hector, which
was churning westward, far off the southern tip of the Baja California
peninsula of Mexico.</p>
<p>The biggest impacts from Tropical Storm Hone (pronounced hoe-NEH)
were rainfall and flash floods that resulted in road closures, downed
power lines and damaged trees in some areas of the Big Island, said
William Ahue, a forecaster at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in
Honolulu. No injuries or major damage had been reported, authorities
said.</p>
<p>Deadly Alaska landslide crashes into homes</p>
<p>A landslide that cut a path down a steep, thickly forested hillside
crashed into several homes in Ketchikan, Alaska, in the latest such
disaster to strike the mountainous region. Sunday’s slide killed one
person and injured three others and prompted the mandatory evacuation of
nearby homes in the city, a popular cruise ship stop along the famed
Inside Passage in the southeastern Alaska panhandle.</p>
<p>The slide area remained unstable Monday, and authorities said that
state and local geologists were arriving to assess the area for
potential secondary slides. Last November, six people — including a
family of five — were killed when a landslide destroyed two homes in
Wrangell, north of Ketchikan.</p>
<p>Flash flood hits Grand Canyon National Park</p>
<p>The body of an Arizona woman who disappeared in Grand Canyon National
Park after a flash flood was recovered Sunday, park rangers said. The
body of Chenoa Nickerson, 33, was discovered by a group rafting down the
Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, the park said in a
statement.</p>
<p>Nickerson was hiking along Havasu Creek about a half-mile (800
meters) from where it meets up with the Colorado River when the flash
flood struck. Nickerson’s husband was among the more than 100 people
safely evacuated.</p>
<p>The flood trapped several hikers in the area above and below Beaver
Falls, one of a series of usually blue-green waterfalls that draw
tourists from around the world to the Havasupai Tribe’s reservation. The
area is prone to flooding that turns its iconic waterfalls chocolate
brown.</p>

<em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Following the lead of the U.S. and
the European Union, Canada says it will impose a 100% tariff on imports
of Chinese electric vehicles and a 25% tariff on imported steel and
aluminum from China. Plus, it’s estimated that there will be 350 million
adults over 60 in India by 2050; so it’s no surprise that companies are
increasingly looking to cash in on the silver economy’s substantial
spending power.

<h2 id="how-de-googled-is-lineage-os">How de-Googled is Lineage OS?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>On the whole, I’m satisfied that Lineage OS, as I use it, is
preventing nearly all of Google’s data collection. I don’t install or
use any Google services, I don’t enable A-GPS, I don’t use Chromium or
the built-in browser. I could eliminate more arcane aspects of data
collection – like the Internet connectivity check – if I wanted to take
the trouble. I don’t think that taking reasonable precautions to avoid
becoming part of Google’s data collection economy makes me a
tinfoil-hatter. Nevertheless, I would probably use GrapheneOS instead,
if I had devices that supported it. Ironically, if I wanted to use
GrapheneOS, I’d have to buy Google-branded mobile devices, which is an
irony that really stings. ↫ Kevin Boone The existence of Android
versions like LineageOS, GrapheneOS, /e/OS, and similar, other
de-Googled mobile operating systems is absolutely vital. The market is
dominated by Google Android and iOS, and since full alternatives that
aren’t Android or iOS are effectively impossible, de-Googled Android is
the best we’re going to get. Regulators must ensure that banks,
government ID applications, popular messaging platforms, and similarly
crucial applications work 100% reliably on de-Googled Android, and do
not require Google Play Services in any way, shape, or form. In The
Netherlands, there are basically three banks that control the market,
and there’s really just one messaging application that rules the country
– WhatsApp – and their use is effectively required to participate in
society. Consequently, these applications and platforms should be
accessible by as many people as possible, and that definitely includes
de-Googled Android devices. Being alive should not be taxed by Apple or
Google.</p>

id="biden-calls-ruling-wrong-as-texas-judge-suspends-immigration-reform-policy">Biden
calls ruling wrong, as Texas judge suspends immigration reform
policy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Houston — A Texas judge has ordered a temporary pause on a policy
that would streamline the process for spouses of U.S. citizens to obtain
legal status in the country, a blow to one of U.S. President Joe Biden’s
biggest immigration reform policies. </p>
<p>Judge J. Campbell Barker granted a 14-day administrative stay Monday
in a case brought by the Republican attorneys general of 16 U.S. states
challenging the policy. </p>
<p>In June, Biden announced the new policy, which streamlined a pathway
to citizenship for an estimated half a million immigrants married to
U.S. nationals. </p>
<p>The 16 states bringing the lawsuit, however, say the policy is
costing them millions of dollars in public services — including health
care, education and law enforcement — used by the immigrants. </p>
<p>In a statement Tuesday, Biden called the new ruling “wrong” while
promising to “continue to fight to secure our border and fix our broken
immigration system.” </p>
<p>Judge Barker wrote in his order that the “claims are substantial and
warrant closer consideration than the court has been able to afford to
date.” </p>
<p>“This is just the first step. We are going to keep fighting for
Texas, our country, and the rule of law,” said Texas Attorney General
Ken Paxton, whose state is party to the case, in a post on social media
platform X after the order. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has been struggling to address immigration,
a hugely divisive issue for many Americans ahead of November’s
presidential election, which will see Vice President Kamala Harris take
on Republican Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The Democratic Party is walking a fine line of seeking to be tougher
on illegal migrants while also introducing reforms to the country’s
inefficient immigration system. </p>
<p>Trump’s campaign for the White House has centered on portraying the
United States as under assault by what he calls a migrant
“invasion.” </p>
<p>The new rules would streamline the process for those who already
qualify for permanent residence by removing a requirement that they
leave the country as part of the application process. </p>
<p>“These families should not be needlessly separated. They should be
able to stay together, and my Administration will not stop fighting for
them,” Biden said in his statement. </p>
<p>The rules applied to those in the country for at least 10 years and
married to a U.S. citizen before June 17, 2024, and also applied to an
estimated 50,000 stepchildren of U.S. citizens. </p>
<p>Those approved would be granted work authorization and the right to
stay in the United States for up to three years while they apply for a
green card, which is a pathway to full citizenship. </p>
<p>Monday’s ruling suspends the granting of this “parole in place”
status, but does not halt the government from continuing to accept
applications for the status. </p>
<p>In a statement, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)
confirmed it would continue to take applications but would not grant any
until the stay was lifted. </p>
<p>“The District Court’s administrative stay order does not affect any
applications that were approved before the administrative stay order was
issued,” USCIS said. </p>
<p>Immigrant rights group Justice Action Center said the order was an
“extreme measure.” </p>
<p>“To halt a process for which Texas has not been able to provide an
iota of evidence that it would harm the state is baffling,” said group
founder Karen Tumlin. </p>
<p>The Justice Action Center earlier Monday filed a motion seeking to
intervene in the lawsuit to defend the program.</p>

private who fled to North Korea will plead guilty to desertion</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An Army private who fled to North Korea just over a year
ago will plead guilty to desertion and four other charges and take
responsibility for his conduct, his lawyer said Monday.</p>
<p>Travis King’s attorney, Franklin D. Rosenblatt, told The Associated
Press that King intends to admit guilt to a total of five military
offenses, including desertion and assaulting an officer. Nine other
offenses, including possession of sexual images of a child, will be
withdrawn and dismissed under the terms of the deal.</p>
<p>King will be given an opportunity at a Sept. 20 hearing at Fort
Bliss, Texas, to discuss his actions and explain what he did.</p>
<p>“He wants to take responsibility for the things that he did,”
Rosenblatt said.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, he added, “Travis is grateful to his friends
and family who have supported him, and to all outside his circle who did
not pre-judge his case based on the initial allegations.”</p>
<p>He declined to comment on a possible sentence that his client might
face. Desertion is a serious charge and can result in imprisonment.</p>
<p>The AP reported last month that the two sides were in plea talks.</p>
<p>King bolted across the heavily fortified border from South Korea in
July 2023, and became the first American detained in North Korea in
nearly five years.</p>
<p>His run into North Korea came soon after he was released from a South
Korean prison where he had served nearly two months on assault
charges.</p>
<p>About a week after his release from the prison, military officers
took him to the airport so he could return to Fort Bliss to face
disciplinary action. He was escorted as far as customs, but instead of
getting on the plane, he joined a civilian tour of the Korean border
village of Panmunjom. He then ran across the border, which is lined with
guards and often crowded with tourists.</p>
<p>He was detained by North Korea, but after about two months, Pyongyang
abruptly announced that it would expel him. On Sept. 28, he was flown to
back to Texas, and has been in custody there.</p>
<p>The U.S. military in October filed a series of charges against King
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, including desertion, as well
as kicking and punching other officers, unlawfully possessing alcohol,
making a false statement and possessing a video of a child engaged in
sexual activity. Those allegations date back to July 10, the same day he
was released from the prison.</p>

id="trump-tries-to-tie-rival-harris-to-chaotic-afghanistan-exit">Trump
tries to tie rival Harris to chaotic Afghanistan exit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump used the
third anniversary on Monday of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan to
try to pin the chaotic pullout on his Democratic rival for the White
House, Kamala Harris.</p>
<p>Trump participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National
Cemetery honoring the 13 servicemembers killed during the U.S. exit,
then later in Detroit blamed Harris, the vice president, and President
Joe Biden for what he termed a “catastrophic” withdrawal.</p>
<p>“Caused by Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, the humiliation in Afghanistan
set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all over the
world,” Trump said in an address to the National Guard Association of
the United States.</p>
<p>It was the latest attempt by Trump and his campaign to raise doubts
about Harris’ fitness to serve as commander-in-chief as the Nov. 5
election draws near and comes after Harris last week proclaimed herself
ready to lead the nation’s armed forces.</p>
<p>The U.S. troop pullout and evacuation of U.S. and allied officials,
citizens and Afghans at risk of Taliban retribution saw crowds of
desperate Afghans trying to enter Kabul airport and men clinging to
aircraft as they taxied down runways in August 2021.</p>
<p>An Islamic State suicide bomber killed 13 U.S. servicemembers and
more than 150 Afghans outside an airport gate.</p>
<p>Harris’ campaign said the fault lay with Trump’s tenure as
president.</p>
<p>“The Biden-Harris administration inherited a mess from Donald Trump,”
said Ammar Moussa, a Harris spokesperson. “Trump wants America to forget
that he had four years to get out of Afghanistan but failed to do
it.”</p>
<p>The Biden administration was following a withdrawal commitment and
timeline that the Trump administration had negotiated with the Taliban
in 2020.</p>
<p>A review released by the U.S. State Department in 2023 found fault
with both the Trump and Biden administrations in the run-up to the
withdrawal.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, also
have sought to turn Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz’s
decades of service into a political vulnerability. Former military
service is often a key selling point for candidates in U.S. political
campaigns.</p>
<p>The Republicans have accused Walz of exaggerating his rank in the
Army National Guard, where he served for 24 years. Walz has described
himself as a retired command sergeant major, one of the highest
noncommissioned officer positions in the Army. While he achieved that
rank, he did not meet the requirements to retire with that title.</p>
<p>The Harris campaign deleted a reference this month to Walz’s rank as
a “command sergeant major” on its website. The campaign also now says
Walz “misspoke” in 2018 during his gubernatorial campaign in Minnesota
when he referred to “weapons of war, that I carried in war.” Walz was
never deployed to a war zone.</p>
<p>Trump, 78, never served in the military. Though he was of draft age
during the Vietnam War, he received four student deferments and a
health-related one after he received a diagnosis for bone spurs in his
feet.</p>
<p>Vance served in the Marine Corps for four years as a combat
correspondent and was deployed to Iraq for roughly seven months. His
position mainly involved writing reports of military activity for public
dissemination and at times interacting with the media.</p>
<p>Harris has not served in the military.</p>
<p>Harris told CNN in 2021 that she was the last person in the room with
Biden when he decided to pull U.S. forces from Afghanistan and end
America’s longest war. She also said that she was comfortable with
Biden’s decision, but it remains unclear what role she played in the
discussion.</p>
<p>Both Biden and Harris released statements marking the anniversary on
Monday.</p>
<p>“These 13 devoted patriots represent the best of America, putting our
beloved nation and their fellow Americans above themselves and deploying
into danger to keep their fellow citizens safe,” Harris said.</p>
<p>Asked Monday why Biden and Harris weren’t marking the anniversary of
the Abbey Gate attack as Trump did at Arlington National Cemetery, White
House national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Trump
had been personally invited by the family members and he called it one
way to honor the fallen.</p>
<p>“Another way is to continue to work,” Kirby said. “Maybe not with a
lot of fanfare, maybe not with a lot of public attention, maybe not with
TV cameras, but to work with might and main every single day to make
sure that the families of the fallen and of those who were injured and
wounded, not just at Abbey Gate, but over the course of the 20-some odd
years that we were in Afghanistan, have the support that they need.”</p>
<p>Also Monday, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that Congress will
posthumously honor the 13 service members by presenting their families
with the Congressional Gold Medal next month. It’s the highest civilian
award that Congress can bestow.</p>

id="trial-opens-for-man-charged-with-killing-10-people-at-colorado-supermarket">Trial
opens for man charged with killing 10 people at Colorado
supermarket</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>denver — Jury selection began Monday in the long-delayed trial of a
man charged with murdering 10 people at a Colorado supermarket in 2021,
a case in which the suspect was ruled mentally unfit to face prosecution
before pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. </p>
<p>The outcome hinges on whether the defense can convince jurors that
Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 25, was so mentally ill at the time of the mass
shooting that he failed to comprehend the difference between right and
wrong and thus should not be held legally responsible for the
killings. </p>
<p>The basic facts of the case are not in dispute. Alissa stormed a King
Soopers grocery store in Boulder, about 28 miles (45 km) northwest of
Denver, on March 22, 2021, armed with a legally purchased Ruger AR-556
pistol, which resembles an AR-15-style rifle. </p>
<p>Police say he killed two people in the store’s parking lot before
shooting eight others to death inside the supermarket. Among those
killed was a police officer responding to the scene. </p>
<p>The shooting spree ended when a police officer shot Alissa in the
leg, leading the gunman, wearing only his underwear, to surrender. He
has remained in custody since the day of the shooting. </p>
<p>Alissa is charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder, in addition
to dozens of counts of attempted murder, assault and weapons offenses
stemming from the incident. </p>
<p>A conviction would carry an automatic sentence of life in prison
without parole. There is no death penalty in Colorado. </p>
<p>The trial officially got under way on Monday morning with the judge
and attorneys for both sides beginning the process of choosing jurors to
hear the case, a court spokesperson said.  </p>
<p>Jury selection is expected to wrap up by week’s end, with opening
statements possible as early as Friday, or on Tuesday following the U.S.
Labor Day holiday.  </p>
<p>The case against Alissa stalled after he underwent a court-ordered
psychiatric evaluation and was diagnosed with schizophrenia in late
2021. Boulder District Judge Ingrid Bakke, relying on the conclusions of
state psychologists, then deemed him incompetent to stand trial. </p>
<p>In November 2023, Bakke found that the defendant’s mental condition
had improved sufficiently under psychiatric treatment to rule him
restored to competency, allowing the prosecution to move forward. </p>
<p>Competence is a legal determination that weighs whether criminal
defendants understand the charges against them and can meaningfully
assist in their own defense. An insanity plea relates instead to the
defendant’s mental status at the time of the alleged crime. </p>
<p>Grim details of the killings emerged during his plea hearing last
year, when a Boulder homicide detective testified that Alissa shot one
man in the back, then pursued the victim as he tried to crawl away and
shot him again, killing him. The detective also testified the suspect
shot and wounded a woman, then fired multiple additional rounds at her
as she curled up in a fetal position, killing her. </p>
<p>All the victims struck by gunfire died of their wounds, authorities
said. </p>
<p>A precise motive for the killings has not been suggested by
prosecutors, though according to a psychologist who treated the gunman
at a state mental hospital, Alissa had said he wanted to “commit suicide
by cop.”</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about all the generative AI slop that’s appearing,
especially with tools like “Reimagine”, and I think it’s going to be a
great thing for the open web. Why? Because Google is unwittingly
shooting itself in the foot in a way that will change the character of
the web. How? The web has […]</p>

platform X edits AI chatbot after election officials warn that it
spreads misinformation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>chicago — The social media platform X has made a change to its
AIchatbot after five secretaries of state warned it was spreading
election misinformation.</p>
<p>Top election officials from Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania and Washington sent a letter this month to Elon Musk
complaining that the platform’s AI chatbot, Grok, produced false
information about state ballot deadlines shortly after President Joe
Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race.</p>
<p>The secretaries of state requested that the chatbot instead direct
users who ask election-related questions to CanIVote.org, a voting
information website run by the National Association of Secretaries of
State.</p>
<p>Before listing responses to election-related questions, the chatbot
now says, “For accurate and up-to-date information about the 2024 U.S.
Elections, please visit Vote.gov.”</p>
<p>Both websites are “trustworthy resources that can connect voters with
their local election officials,” the five secretaries of state said in a
shared statement.</p>
<p>“We appreciate X’s action to improve their platform and hope they
continue to make improvements that will ensure their users have access
to accurate information from trusted sources in this critical election
year,” they said.</p>
<p>Grok is available only to subscribers of the premium versions of X.
But the five secretaries of state who signed the letter said election
misinformation from Grok has been shared across multiple social media
platforms, reaching millions of people. Grok continued to repeat the
false information for 10 days before it was corrected, the secretaries
said. The platform did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The change promoting a link to an official voting website does not
seem to address Grok’s ability to create misleading AI-generated images
related to elections. People have been using the tool to flood the
platform with fake images of candidates, including Vice President Kamala
Harris and former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Grok debuted last year for X premium and premium plus subscribers and
was touted by Musk as a “rebellious” AI chatbot that will answer “spicy
questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.”</p>
<p>Social media platforms have faced mounting scrutiny for their role in
spreading misinformation, including about elections. The letter also
warned that inaccuracies are to be expected for AI products, especially
chatbots such as Grok that are based on large language models.</p>
<p>Since Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and renamed it to X, watchdog
groups have raised concerns over a surge in hate speech and
misinformation being amplified on the platform, as well as cuts to the
staff that had been moderating content.</p>
<p>Experts say the moves represent a regression from progress made by
social media platforms attempting to better combat political
disinformation after the 2016 U.S. presidential contest and could
precipitate a worsening misinformation landscape ahead of this year’s
November elections.</p>

<p>I spend a lot of time at Carbonfact working on datasets shared by our
customers. We typically set things up so that our customers can export
data automatically. They usually deposit files to a GCP bucket, with a
script, once a day. We then have an ETL script for each customer that
runs afterwards to fetch their latest data and process it. During
development, I load customer data to my laptop and work on it.</p>
