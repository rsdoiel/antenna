The memory of January 6 has vanished from Trump’s new Washington, David Frum writes. But “some of us need to volunteer to keep talking about the inconvenient things. Trump really did try by violence to violate the first rule of constitutional democracy”

## Quoting François Chollet

date: 2025-01-06, updated: 2025-01-06, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://bsky.app/profile/fchollet.bsky.social/post/3les3izgdj22j"><p>I don't think people really appreciate how simple ARC-AGI-1 was, and what solving it really means.</p>
<p>It was designed as the simplest, most basic assessment of fluid intelligence possible. Failure to pass signifies a near-total inability to adapt or problem-solve in unfamiliar situations.</p>
<p>Passing it means your system exhibits non-zero fluid intelligence -- you're finally looking at something that isn't pure memorized skill. But it says rather little about how intelligent your system is, or how close to human intelligence it is.</p></blockquote>

## AI’s next leap requires intimate access to your digital life

date: 2025-01-06, updated: 2025-01-06, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/05/agents-ai-chatbots-google-mariner/">AI’s next leap requires intimate access to your digital life</a></strong></p>
I'm quoted in this Washington Post story by Gerrit De Vynck about "agents" - which in this case are defined as AI systems that operate a computer system like a human might, for example <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/22/computer-use/">Anthropic's Computer Use demo</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The problem is that language models as a technology are inherently gullible,” said Simon Willison, a software developer who has tested many AI tools, including Anthropic’s technology for agents. “How do you unleash that on regular human beings without enormous problems coming up?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got the closing quote too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you ignore the safety and security and privacy side of things, this stuff is so exciting, the potential is amazing,” Willison said. “I just don’t see how we get past these problems.”</p>
</blockquote>

## Episode 149 - IDRIS Is Not UNIX

date: 2025-01-05, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">This episode we are taking a trip back to UNIX world. We're looking at IDRIS, the first clone of UNIX. It was supposed to be highly compatible, but use no code from Bell Labs. IDRIS ran on everything from the Intel 8080 up to the IBM System/370. There was even a version that could run MS-DOS programs. Sound too good to be true? Well, that may be the case.</p> <p>Selected Sources:</p> <p><a href= "https://archive.org/details/aquartercenturyofunixpeterh.salus_201910/page/n196/mode/1up" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://archive.org/details/aquartercenturyofunixpeterh.salus_201910/page/n196/mode/1up</a> - A Quarter Century of UNIX</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/hansake/Whitesmiths-Idris-OS" rel= "noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-link-auto= "">https://github.com/hansake/Whitesmiths-Idris-OS</a> - Co-Idris disk images and executables</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.niemanlab.org/2024/12/publishers-find-the-ai-era-not-all-that-lucrative/"><p>According to public financial documents from its parent company IAC and first reported <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/openai-dotdash-meredith-licensing-payment/">by Adweek</a>
 OpenAI is paying around $16 million per year to license content [from Dotdash Meredith].</p>
<p>That is no doubt welcome incremental revenue, and you could call it “lucrative” in the sense of having a fat margin, as OpenAI is almost certainly paying for content that was already being produced. But to put things into perspective, Dotdash Meredith is on course to generate over $1.5 billion in revenues in 2024, more than a third of it from print. So the OpenAI deal is equal to about 1% of the publisher’s total revenue.</p></blockquote>
