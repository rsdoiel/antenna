<h2 id="use-of-a-calendar">2024-02-28 Use of a calendar</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-28 Use of a calendar
</h1>
<p>
In the last millennium, I used the
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Diary.html">Emacs
Diary</a> for my calendar. I mean, why not? The
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary.html">Emacs
Calendar</a> is great. Better than the <code>cal</code> command-line
utility, in any case. But eventually the world got mobile phones then I
wanted an online calendar.
</p>
<p>
The example from the Emacs Diary documentation:
</p>
<pre><code>12/22/2015  Twentieth wedding anniversary!
10/22       Ruth's birthday.
* 21, *:    Payday
Tuesday--weekly meeting with grad students at 10am
         Supowit, Shen, Bitner, and Kapoor to attend.
1/13/89     Friday the thirteenth!!
thu 4pm     squash game with Lloyd.
mar 16      Dad's birthday
April 15, 2016 Income tax due.
* 15        time cards due.
</code></pre>
<p>
Back then, Google didn’t want to be evil and I used Google Calendar.
When Google changed its mind, so did I. I switched to
<a href="2020-06-10_Radicale_for_Calendar_and_Contacts">Radicale</a>.
</p>
<p>
And yet, I sort of missed those diary file entries.
</p>
<p>
Today,
<a class="account" href="https://social.tadzik.net/users/tadzik" title="@tadzik@social.tadzik.net"><span
class="citation" data-cites="tadzik">@tadzik</span></a> posted a link to
<a href="https://codeberg.org/tadzik/caleb">caleb</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>caleb</code> will do its best to interpret a calendar event
description, create a valid iCalendar event for it and optionally upload
it to a CalDAV server.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nice!
</p>
<p>
Example usage, from the README:
</p>
<pre><code>$ caleb friday 5pm beer
</code></pre>
<p>
My main problem was that it took me a while to figure out what the
correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV">CalDAV</a> URL
is. I looked into my iPhone accounts (my first mistake) and tried
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/</code>, then
<code>https://example.org/radicale/alex/Alex</code> – some of these URLs
failed silently, some of them created new collections with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">iCalendar</a> filename
as the collection name… and I didn’t get an warnings or error messages.
I mean, it makes sense. It’s like a filesystem, you can save whatever
you want. But it’s not what the calendar apps expect.
</p>
<p>
So, how do I discover the correct URL? Using a command-line
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV">WebDAV</a> explorer like
<code>cadaver</code>. The following example shows how I log into
Radicale and list the contents of the two directory I found. One of them
is full of <code>.vcf</code> files (contacts), the other is full of
<code>.ics</code> files (calendar entries). That’s the one!
</p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p>
Now I’m finally ready to go back to <code>caleb</code> and create the
config file, <code>~/.config/caleb.conf</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>[caldav]
url = &quot;https://example.org/radicale/alex/cae8e041-61d9-b51a-57db-294b07e8dc1e&quot;
username = &quot;alex&quot;
password = &quot;*secret*&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
Enjoy!

with <em>Yahoo! Finance</em>, Stella Li, CEO of BYD Americas, called the
U.S. market “interesting,” but said it was too messy to be worth a great
investment from the Chinese carmaker. “U.S. market is a little bit slow
down on electrification and a lot of confusing,” Li said, adding:
“Everything is complicated. Politics are complicated … and it’s
confusing for the consumer, and then they don’t know which to choose.”
Meanwhile, in China, “the message is strong. If you are not investing
for electric car, you are out. You will die. You have no future.”<br/>

penned by <em>Heatmap</em>’s Robinson Meyer yesterday in <em>The New
York Times</em>, in which he says American automakers need to recognize
that “Chinese companies now understand aspects of EV manufacturing
better than their American counterparts.” Even if BYD stays out of the
U.S. for now, Meyer notes Chinese automaker Geely is preparing to sell
the small, all-electric Volvo EX30 SUV in the U.S. for $35,000, and
BYD’s cheap EVs still threaten global sales of American cars. “In the
short term, American automakers — even the homegrown electric-only
carmakers like Tesla and Rivian — must be shielded from a wave of cheap
cars,” Robinson wrote. “But in the long term, Mr. Biden must be careful
not to cordon off the American car market from the rest of the world,
turning the United States into an automotive backwater of bloated,
expensive, gas-guzzling vehicles.”

that 21% of Navajo Nation homes and 35% of Hopi Indian Tribe homes
remain unelectrified, and even if homes do have electricity, they
frequently experience outages. The projects vary in cost and scope: Some
aim to install solar panels and battery storage and microgrids, others
focus on new hydroelectric facilities. There are heat pump initiatives
and EV charging stations. The projects have to submit a plan
demonstrating how they will benefit the local community and will undergo
negotiations with the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations before
they’re given the green light. The funding was made available through
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Issues Executive Order to Better Shield Americans’ Sensitive Data From
Foreign Foes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden on Wednesday is signing an executive
order aimed at better protecting Americans’ personal data on everything
from biometrics and health records to finances and geolocation from
foreign adversaries like China and Russia.</p>
<p>The attorney general and other federal agencies are to prevent the
large-scale transfer of Americans’ personal data to what the White House
calls “countries of concern,” while erecting safeguards around other
activities that can give those countries access to people’s sensitive
data.</p>
<p>The goal is to do so without limiting legitimate commerce around
data, senior Biden administration officials said on a call with
reporters. </p>
<p>Biden’s move targets commercial data brokers, the sometimes shadowy
companies that traffic in personal data and that officials say may sell
information to foreign adversaries or U.S. entities controlled by those
countries.</p>
<p>Most eventual enforcement mechanisms still have to clear complicated
and often monthslong rulemaking processes. Still, the administration
hopes eventually to limit foreign entities, as well as
foreign-controlled companies operating in the U.S., that might otherwise
improperly collect sensitive data, the senior officials said.</p>
<p>Data brokers are legal in the U.S. and collect and categorize
personal information, usually to build profiles on millions of Americans
that the brokers then rent or sell.</p>
<p>The officials said activities like computer hacking are already
prohibited in the U.S., but that buying potentially sensitive data
through brokers is legal. That can represent a key gap in the nation’s
national security protections when data is sold to a broker knowing it
could end up in the hands of an adversary — one the administration now
aims to close with the president’s executive action.</p>
<p>“Bad actors can use this data to track Americans, including military
service members, pry into their personal lives, and pass that data on to
other data brokers and foreign intelligence services,” the White House
wrote in a fact sheet announcing the move. “This data can enable
intrusive surveillance, scams, blackmail, and other violations of
privacy.”</p>
<p>The order directs the Department of Justice to issue regulations that
establish protections for Americans’ sensitive personal data, as well as
sensitive government-related data — including geolocation information on
sensitive government sites and members of the military. </p>
<p>The Justice Department also plans to work with Homeland Security
officials to build safety standards to prevent foreign adversaries from
collecting data. It will further attempt better checks to ensure that
federal grants going to various other agencies, including the
departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, aren’t used to facilitate
Americans’ sensitive data flowing to foreign adversaries or U.S.
companies aligned with them.</p>
<p>The senior administration officials listed potential countries of
concern as China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. But it
is China — and TikTok, which has over 150 million American users and is
a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. —
that U.S. leaders have been most vocal about.</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the House
Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, recently noted,
“There’s no such thing as a private business in China.”</p>
<p>The senior administration officials stressed that the executive
action was designed to work in conjunction with legislative action. So
far, however, numerous bills seeking to establish federal privacy
protections have failed to advance in Congress.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s move follows Biden’s executive order on artificial
intelligence last fall that seeks to balance the needs of cutting-edge
technology companies with national security and consumer rights.</p>
<p>That sought to steer how AI is developed so that companies can profit
without putting public safety in jeopardy, creating early guardrails
meant to ensure that AI is trustworthy and helpful, rather than
deceptive and destructive.</p>

In the first week of January, the pharmaceutical giant Merck quietly

40,000 of Merck’s computers, which significantly disrupted the company’s
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1AD1AO/">drug and
vaccine production</a>. After Merck filed its $700 million claim, the
pharmaceutical giant’s insurers argued that they were not required to
cover the malware’s damage because the cyberattack was widely attributed
to the Russian government and therefore was excluded from standard
property and casualty insurance coverage as a “hostile or warlike act.”…

<h2 id="what-might-happen-without-a-leap-day-more-than-you-think">What
Might Happen Without a Leap Day? More Than You Think</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Leap year. It’s a delight for the calendar and math nerds
among us. So how did it all begin and why?</p>
<p>Have a look at some of the numbers, history and lore behind the (not
quite) every four-year phenom that adds a 29th day to February.</p>
<p>By the numbers</p>
<p>The math is mind-boggling in a layperson sort of way and down to
fractions of days and minutes. There’s even a leap second occasionally,
but there’s no hullabaloo when that happens.</p>
<p>The thing to know is that leap year exists, in large part, to keep
the months in sync with annual events, including equinoxes and
solstices, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California
Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>It’s a correction to counter the fact that Earth’s orbit isn’t
precisely 365 days a year. The trip takes about six hours longer than
that, NASA says.</p>
<p>Contrary to what some might believe, however, not every four years is
a leaper. Adding a leap day every four years would make the calendar
longer by more than 44 minutes, according to the National Air &amp;
Space Museum.</p>
<p>Later, on a calendar yet to come (we’ll get to it), it was decreed
that years divisible by 100 not follow the four-year leap day rule
unless they are also divisible by 400, the JPL notes. In the past 500
years, there was no leap day in 1700, 1800 and 1900, but 2000 had one.
In the next 500 years, if the practice is followed, there will be no
leap day in 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500.</p>
<p>Still with us?</p>
<p>The next leap years are 2028, 2032 and 2036.</p>
<p>What would happen without a leap day?</p>
<p>Eventually, nothing good in terms of when major events fall, when
farmers plant and how seasons align with the sun and the moon.</p>
<p>“Without the leap years, after a few hundred years we will have
summer in November,” said Younas Khan, a physics instructor at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham. “Christmas will be in summer. There
will be no snow. There will be no feeling of Christmas.”</p>
<p>Who came up with leap year?</p>
<p>The short answer: It evolved.</p>
<p>Ancient civilizations used the cosmos to plan their lives, and there
are calendars dating back to the Bronze Age. They were based on either
the phases of the moon or the sun, as various calendars are today.
Usually they were “lunisolar,” using both.</p>
<p>Now hop on over to the Roman Empire and Julius Caesar. He was dealing
with major seasonal drift on calendars used in his neck of the woods.
They dealt badly with drift by adding months. He was also navigating
many calendars starting in many ways in the vast Roman Empire.</p>
<p>He introduced his Julian calendar in 46 BCE. It was purely solar and
counted a year at 365.25 days, so once every four years an extra day was
added. Before that, the Romans counted a year at 355 days, at least for
a time.</p>
<p>But still, under Julius, there was drift. There were too many leap
years! The solar year isn’t precisely 365.25 days! It’s 365.242 days,
said Nick Eakes, an astronomy educator at the Morehead Planetarium and
Science Center at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>Thomas Palaima, a classics professor at the University of Texas at
Austin, said adding periods of time to a year to reflect variations in
the lunar and solar cycles was done by the ancients. The Athenian
calendar, he said, was used in the fourth, fifth and sixth centuries
with 12 lunar months.</p>
<p>That didn’t work for seasonal religious rites. The drift problem led
to “intercalating” an extra month periodically to realign with lunar and
solar cycles, Palaima said.</p>
<p>The Julian calendar was 0.0078 days (11 minutes and 14 seconds)
longer than the tropical year, so errors in timekeeping still gradually
accumulated, according to NASA. But stability increased, Palaima
said.</p>
<p>The Julian calendar was the model used by the Western world for
hundreds of years. Enter Pope Gregory XIII, who calibrated further. His
Gregorian calendar took effect in the late 16th century. It remains in
use today and, clearly, isn’t perfect or there would be no need for leap
year. But it was a big improvement, reducing drift to mere seconds.</p>
<p>Why did he step in? Well, Easter. It was coming later in the year
over time, and he fretted that events related to Easter like the
Pentecost might bump up against pagan festivals. The pope wanted Easter
to remain in the spring.</p>
<p>He eliminated some extra days accumulated on the Julian calendar and
tweaked the rules on leap day. It’s Pope Gregory and his advisers who
came up with the really gnarly math on when there should or shouldn’t be
a leap year.</p>
<p>“If the solar year was a perfect 365.25 then we wouldn’t have to
worry about the tricky math involved,” Eakes said.</p>
<p>What’s the deal with leap year and marriage?</p>
<p>Bizarrely, leap day comes with lore about women popping the marriage
question to men. It was mostly benign fun, but it came with a bite that
reinforced gender roles.</p>
<p>There’s distant European folklore. One story places the idea of women
proposing in fifth century Ireland, with St. Bridget appealing to
St. Patrick to offer women the chance to ask men to marry them,
according to historian Katherine Parkin in a 2012 paper in the Journal
of Family History.</p>
<p>Nobody really knows where it all began.</p>
<p>In 1904, syndicated columnist Elizabeth Meriwether Gilmer, aka
Dorothy Dix, summed up the tradition this way: “Of course people will
say … that a woman’s leap year prerogative, like most of her liberties,
is merely a glittering mockery.”</p>
<p>The pre-Sadie Hawkins tradition, however serious or tongue-in-cheek,
could have empowered women but merely perpetuated stereotypes. The
proposals were to happen via postcard, but many such cards turned the
tables and poked fun at women instead.</p>
<p>Advertising perpetuated the leap year marriage game. A 1916 ad by the
American Industrial Bank and Trust Co. read thusly: “This being Leap
Year day, we suggest to every girl that she propose to her father to
open a savings account in her name in our own bank.”</p>
<p>There was no breath of independence for women due to leap day.</p>
<p>Should we pity the leaplings?</p>
<p>Being born in a leap year on a leap day certainly is a talking point.
But it can be kind of a pain from a paperwork perspective. Some
governments and others requiring forms to be filled out and birthdays to
be stated stepped in to declare what date was used by leaplings for such
things as drivers’ licenses, whether Feb. 28 or March 1.</p>
<p>Technology has made it far easier for leap babies to jot down their
Feb. 29 milestones, though there can be glitches in terms of health
systems, insurance policies and with other businesses and organizations
that don’t have that date built in.</p>
<p>There are about 5 million people worldwide who share the leap
birthday out of about 8 billion people on the planet. Shelley Dean, 23,
in Seattle, Washington, chooses a rosy attitude about being a leapling.
Growing up, she had normal birthday parties each year, but an extra
special one when leap years rolled around. Since, as an adult, she marks
that non-leap period between Feb. 28 and March 1 with a low-key
“whew.”</p>
<p>This year is different.</p>
<p>“It will be the first birthday that I’m going to celebrate with my
family in eight years, which is super exciting, because the last leap
day I was on the other side of the country in New York for college,” she
said. “It’s a very big year.”</p>

When we talk about carbon removal, we often focus on “direct air
capture” facilities — big factories that suck carbon dioxide out of the
ambient air.
</p>
<p>
But a simpler and easier way to remove carbon from the atmosphere may
exist. It’s called
“<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/04/big-tech-investment-carbon-removal/629545/">enhanced
rock weathering</a>” — grinding up rocks, spreading them out, and
exposing them to the ambient air — and it works, essentially, by
speeding up the Earth’s carbon cycle. Enhanced rock weathering recently
got a major vote of confidence from Frontier, a consortium of tech and
finance companies who have teamed up to support new and experimental
carbon removal technologies.
</p>
<p>
Frontier’s members include Stripe, Meta, Alphabet, Shopify, and McKinsey
&amp; Company. It aims to buy nearly $1 billion of various forms of
carbon removal in the next few years — an intervention meant to spur
commercial and investor interest in the sector.
</p>
<p>
In this episode, Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems expert and professor
at Princeton University, and I talk with Jane Flegal, a former Biden
White House climate adviser and now the market development and policy
lead at Frontier, about the
<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2319436121">promise of
enhanced rock weathering</a> and why Frontier just
<a href="https://frontierclimate.com/portfolio/lithos">spent $57
million</a> to do it.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jane Flegal: </strong>So enhanced weathering is a carbon removal
process that speeds up a natural process which is weathering of alkaline
materials. And so weathering happens naturally, it actually drives what
makes the earth habitable in the first place. It just happens over very,
very long periods. So essentially what happens is that rocks slowly
erode when they come into contact with acid rain essentially and —<br/>
<br/> <strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>Naturally acidic rain?<br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal: </strong>Yeah, not like acid rain the way we think of
it, rain that is acidic because it has some dissolved CO2. And so that
acidic rainwater interacts with rocks and erodes them, and it results in
CO2 being stored either as a solid carbonate or as a bicarbonate. So
that happens naturally, again, on very long time periods. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And I just want to interrupt before we go any
further. What then happens, right, is that the CO2 winds up being
dissolved as a bicarbonate. It goes into the ocean.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal: </strong>Into the ocean.<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer:
</strong>And then what happens? It’s turned into …<br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal: </strong>It sinks and becomes part of the Earth’s
crust.<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer: </strong>Right. Or it gets turned into
a shell, a creature’s shell, and then it sinks again.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal:</strong> It is functionally stable. It is
thermodynamically pretty much impossible to reverse.<br/> <br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>And you kind of said this, but I do want to draw
it out: This is the carbon cycle. This is a central Earth science
process. There’s nothing fancy about this.<br/> <br/> <strong>Jesse
Jenkins: </strong>The problem is it takes centuries to play out. It’s
just moving on geologic time. But this idea of enhanced weathering means
we can potentially speed that up, right?<br/> <br/> <strong>Meyer:
</strong>Sorry, I just want to — this is, like, the whole problem of
climate change, right? The problem of climate change is that we take
fossil fuels and carbon that’s stored in geological storage out of the
ground on historic time scales, on decadal … you know, every year we
take millions of tons of it out of the ground, and then it would only be
restored back to the ground by this extremely slow process. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Flegal: </strong>One way to think about carbon removal is, like,
taking stuff out of the fast cycle and putting it into the slow cycle,
basically. And essentially, you either inject CO2 underground, where
it’s where it’s stable, or you turn it into salt. These are kind of the
options. <br/> <br/> And so enhanced weathering, to exactly this point,
it’s enhanced for a reason, right? There’s regular old weathering, and
then there’s the enhanced kind, which aims to speed up this process that
typically takes millennia to years or days by either using more reactive
materials than the normal rocks that would just weather naturally or
increasing the surface area of the material that is exposed to CO2. So
grinding up rocks into very, very fine fine powder and exposing that
material to more favorable environments.

<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: Robert Reich on Substack</p>
<p>Friends, The question was never whether Joe Biden would win the
Michigan primary. It was how successful would be a homegrown campaign to
persuade Michiganders to vote “uncommitted.” Well, we now have the
results, and they should serve as a wakeup call to Biden. With most
votes counted on Wednesday morning, 13 percent of Michigan’s Democratic
primary voters had chosen “uncommitted” — a share that represented more
than 100,000 people in Michigan who made the effort to lodge their
disapproval of the president.</p>

the February 19 Presidents Day holiday. It is facing a number of crucial
issues, but the ongoing problem of the radicalism of the MAGA
Republicans has ground—and, apparently, continues to grind—legislation
to a halt.</p>

<p>As negotiators push to secure a temporary cease-fire deal that would
halt the Gaza war before Ramadan begins, a message from Michiganders
signaling anger at President Joe Biden’s support of Israel’s campaign

<h2 id="us-army-slashing-thousands-of-posts-in-major-revamp">US Army
Slashing Thousands of Posts in Major Revamp</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Army is slashing the size of its force by about
24,000, or almost 5%, and restructuring to be better able to fight the
next major war, as the service struggles with recruiting shortfalls that
made it impossible to bring in enough soldiers to fill all the jobs.</p>
<p>The cuts will mainly be in already-empty posts — not actual soldiers
— including in jobs related to counterinsurgency that swelled during the
Iraq and Afghanistan wars but are not needed as much today. About 3,000
of the cuts would come from Army special operations forces.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, the plan will add about 7,500 troops in
other critical missions, including air-defense and counter-drone units
and five new task forces around the world with enhanced cyber,
intelligence and long-range strike capabilities.</p>
<p>Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said she and Gen. Randy George, the
Army chief, worked to thin out the number of places where they had empty
or excess slots.</p>
<p>“We’re moving away from counterterrorism and counterinsurgency. We
want to be postured for large-scale combat operations,” Wormuth told
reporters on Tuesday. “So we looked at where were there pieces of force
structure that were probably more associated with counterinsurgency, for
example, that we don’t need anymore.”</p>
<p>George added that Army leaders did a lot of analysis to choose the
places to cut.</p>
<p>“The things that we want to not have in our formation are actually
things that we don’t think are going to make us successful on the
battlefield going forward,” he said.</p>
<p>According to an Army document, the service is “significantly
overstructured” and there aren’t enough soldiers to fill existing units.
The cuts, it said, are “spaces” not “faces” and the Army will not be
asking soldiers to leave the force.</p>
<p>Instead, the decision reflects the reality that for years the Army
hasn’t been able to fill thousands of empty posts. While the Army as
it’s currently structured can have up to 494,000 soldiers, the total
number of active-duty soldiers right now is about 445,000. Under the new
plan, the goal is to bring in enough troops over the next five years to
reach a level of 470,000.</p>
<p>The planned overhaul comes after two decades of war in Iraq and
Afghanistan that forced the Army to quickly and dramatically expand in
order to fill the brigades sent to the battlefront. That included a
massive counterinsurgency mission to battle al-Qaida, the Taliban and
the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>Over time the military’s focus has shifted to great power competition
from adversaries such as China and Russia, and threats from Iran and
North Korea. And the war in Ukraine has shown the need for greater
emphasis on air-defense systems and high-tech abilities both to use and
counter airborne and sea-based drones.</p>
<p>Army leaders said they looked carefully across the board at all the
service’s job specialties in search of places to trim. And they examined
the ongoing effort to modernize the Army, with new high-tech weapons, to
determine where additional forces should be focused.</p>
<p>According to the plan, the Army will cut about 10,000 spaces for
engineers and similar jobs that were tied to counter-insurgency
missions. An additional 2,700 cuts will come from units that don’t
deploy often and can be trimmed, and 6,500 will come from various
training and other posts.</p>
<p>There also will be about 10,000 posts cut from cavalry squadrons,
Stryker brigade combat teams, infantry brigade combat teams and security
force assistance brigades, which are used to train foreign forces.</p>
<p>The changes represent a significant shift for the Army to prepare for
large-scale combat operations against more sophisticated enemies. But
they also underscore the steep recruiting challenges that all of the
military services are facing.</p>
<p>In the last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the Navy, Army and Air
Force all failed to meet their recruitment goals, while the Marine Corps
and the tiny Space Force met their targets. The Army brought in a bit
more than 50,000 recruits, falling well short of the publicly stated
“stretch goal” of 65,000.</p>
<p>The previous fiscal year, the Army also missed its enlistment goal by
15,000. That year the goal was 60,000.</p>
<p>In response, the service launched a sweeping overhaul of its
recruiting last fall to focus more on young people who have spent time
in college or are job hunting early in their careers. And it is forming
a new professional force of recruiters, rather than relying on soldiers
randomly assigned to the task.</p>
<p>In discussing the changes at the time, Wormuth acknowledged that the
service hasn’t been recruiting well “for many more years than one would
think from just looking at the headlines in the last 18 months.” The
service, she said, hasn’t met its annual goal for new enlistment
contracts since 2014.</p>

id="killing-of-georgia-nursing-student-at-center-of-us-immigration-debate">Killing
of Georgia Nursing Student at Center of US Immigration Debate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-28, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Athens, Georgia — Laken Riley was a 22-year-old nursing student out
on her morning run at the University of Georgia when authorities say a
stranger dragged her into a secluded area and killed her, sending
shockwaves through campus as police searched for a suspect.</p>
<p>The arrest of a Venezuelan man who entered the U.S. illegally and was
allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case put the tragedy at the
center of the 2024 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump blamed President Joe Biden and his
border policies for the Augusta University student’s fatal beating. A
conservative news site blasted “open-border elites” for accepting the
deaths of women such as Riley as “collateral damage.”</p>
<p>It is familiar ground for Trump, who launched his 2016 White House
bid by saying Mexicans were “bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some,
I assume, are good people.”</p>
<p>As president, he created an office for families whose loved ones were
victims of violent crimes committed by immigrants, which was quickly
dismantled under Biden.</p>
<p>The debate over the nation’s broken immigration system has emerged as
a major campaign issue amid an unprecedented migration surge that has
strained budgets in cities including New York, Chicago and Denver and
divided some Democrats.</p>
<p>Trump has dialed up his anti-immigrant rhetoric to say migrants are
“poisoning the blood” of the country. And he and other Republicans have
suggested migrants are committing crimes more often than U.S. citizens,
even though the evidence does not back up those claims.</p>
<p>Biden has criticized Republicans for turning against a bipartisan
border security deal after Trump decried it. He will visit the Texas
border city of Brownsville on Thursday, while Trump will be in another
Texas border city, Eagle Pass.</p>
<p>On his social media site, Trump posted, “Crooked Joe Biden’s Border
INVASION is destroying our country and killing our citizens! The
horrible murder of 22-year-old Laken Riley at the University of Georgia
should have NEVER happened!”</p>
<p>“He’s an animal that came in,” Trump said Tuesday on Michigan’s WFDF
radio station.</p>
<p>Democrats have been more muted, with many expressing sorrow for
Riley’s death and some accusing Trump of exploiting a tragedy and using
xenophobic rhetoric for political gain.</p>
<p>The White House extended “deepest condolences” to Riley’s family.
“People should be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law if
they are found to be guilty,” said spokesperson Angelo Fernández
Hernández.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, predicted Riley’s death is
“gonna change this election as much as anything.”</p>
<p>“That’s a parent’s worst nightmare,” the South Carolina Republican
said.</p>
<p>Many studies have found immigrants are less drawn to violent crime
than native-born citizens. One published by the National Academy of
Sciences, based on Texas Department of Public Safety data from 2012 to
2018, reported native-born U.S. residents were more than twice as likely
to be arrested for violent crimes than people in the country
illegally.</p>
<p>Another in the journal Criminology analyzed multiple data sources
from 1990 to 2014 to conclude that increases in illegal immigration were
generally in sync with reductions in violent crime or had no significant
correlation.</p>
<p>A study published last year by the National Bureau of Economic
Research, a private group, found immigrants have been incarcerated at a
lower rate than U.S.-born white men since 1960.</p>
<p>“Whereas Democrats are increasingly more positive when talking about
immigrants and pointing to their contributions to the U.S., Republicans
remain negative and increasingly focus on crime and legality issues when
they talk about immigrants,” said Ran Abramitzky, a Stanford University
economics professor who has studied links between immigration and crime,
referring to analyses of congressional statements going back
decades.</p>
<p>Jon Feere, a former U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement
official in the Trump administration who now is director of
investigations at the Center for Immigration Studies, dismissed the
research. He pointed to migrants who don’t have legal permission to be
in the U.S., saying they are committing crimes just by being here.</p>
<p>“This type of fallout’s going to continue for many years to come,
even beyond this administration,” Feere said. “And they can continue to
ignore it, but the American people are paying attention.”</p>
<p>Families of victims have heartbreaking stories.</p>
<p>Don Rosenberg, a retired entertainment and publishing executive, lost
his 25-year-old son, Drew, in 2010, when a Honduran man who was in the
country illegally repeatedly struck him with his car in San Francisco
and tried to flee. As he spoke with families whose loved ones were
killed by immigrants, he concluded authorities were ignoring them, even
protecting perpetrators.</p>
<p>“I thought my case was an anomaly. No, my case was the rule,” said
Rosenberg, president of Advocates for Victims of Illegal Alien
Crime.</p>
<p>Rosenberg says the high-profile cases won’t resonate with voters
until news organizations give them more exposure “because Trump only
talks to people who support Trump.”</p>
<p>The man accused of killing Riley, Jose Ibarra, was arrested for
illegal entry in September 2022 near El Paso, Texas, amid an
unprecedented surge in migration and released to pursue his case in
immigration court.</p>
<p>At the time, the Border Patrol was releasing migrants with orders to
appear at an immigration office, not even scheduling court appearances.
That practice, which added years to how long it takes to resolve an
immigration case, largely ceased in February 2023.</p>
<p>It is unclear if Ibarra, 26, followed those instructions or applied
for asylum. Federal officials say he was arrested by New York police in
August for child endangerment and released, though New York officials
said Sunday they had no record of the arrest.</p>
<p>Iberra was living in Athens, Georgia, when Riley was killed last
week. His attorney has not responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Trump first mentioned the killing on Friday, calling it part of what
he has labeled “Biden migrant crime.” It comes after a group of migrants
brawling with police in New York touched off a political furor and
renewed debate over policies that limit cooperation with federal
immigration authorities.</p>
<p>The influential conservative site Breitbart News linked Riley’s death
to other women who were killed by people in the country illegally,
including Kate Steinle, who was shot at a crowded San Francisco pier in
2015. “Their deaths were all 100% preventable,” the site said.</p>

<p><strong><span class="citation" data-cites="Jessica">@Jessica</span>
Smith’s blog</strong> (date: 2024-02-28, from: Jessica Smith’s blog)</p>
<p>
Last night I was cooking a chicken stew, and I had to double-check my
recipe to remember which herbs I put in it (rosemary, thyme, basil, sage
and a bay leaf). As I was grabbing the little jars out of the cupboard,
it occurred to me that this list is pretty similar to that famous lyric
– <q>parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme</q> – and wondered, “Hmm, why is
it I never put parsley in this? Or, actually, into anything?” So I
pulled out my little jar of parsley, gave the contents a sniff (parsley
really doesn’t have a very appealing smell, hey) and read the
description on the jar’s side:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A popular herb used to garnish or add a touch of colour to your
favourite meal. Great with sauces and egg dishes.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
“Oh yeah!” I remembered. “Parsley is so crap that even the parsley jar
can only suggest adding it to anything for cosmetic reasons. That’s why
I never use it.”
</p>
<p>
Clearly, it’s time we change the line in that song to “basil, sage,
rosemary and thyme”. And a bay leaf.

<h2 id="top-lawmaker-warns-us-less-prepared-for-election-meddling">Top
Lawmaker Warns US ‘Less Prepared’ for Election Meddling</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States might not be ready for the onslaught
of disinformation and cyberattacks expected to hit the country ahead of
this year’s presidential elections, according to a top U.S.
lawmaker.</p>
<p>Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner told a
cybersecurity conference in Washington that despite efforts by various
U.S. government agencies to protect against election meddling, there are
still gaps, especially when it comes to foreign influence campaigns.</p>
<p>“I worry that we are less prepared for foreign intervention in our
elections in 2024 than we were in 2020,” he told the Trellix
Cybersecurity Summit.</p>
<p>He added that the prevalence of artificial intelligence could also
make Russia’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election
look “like child’s play.”</p>
<p>Top U.S. law enforcement and cybersecurity officials have repeatedly
voiced confidence in their ability to protect the nation’s voting
infrastructure from attacks from any number of U.S. adversaries.</p>
<p>“Americans can be confident in our election system and our
democracy,” FBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers last month,
backed by the leaders of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure
Security Agency (CISA) and the National Security Agency.</p>
<p>But officials have expressed concerns about influence operations,
especially from Russia, China and Iran, designed to exploit existing
U.S. domestic political divisions.</p>
<p>Warner on Tuesday said he believes that is where Washington election
defenses are most vulnerable, citing a court ruling that has prohibited
social media companies from sharing information about potential foreign
influence operations with the FBI or CISA.</p>
<p>“That ought to scare the hell out of all of us,” he said, adding that
voter susceptibility may be at an all-time high.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a whole lot of more Americans in 2024, unfortunately, that
are more willing to believe or have less faith in our system to start
with,” Warner said.</p>
<p>Warner’s warning about Russian election meddling echoes comments by
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan.</p>
<p>“There’s plenty of reason to be concerned,” Sullivan told NBC’s “Meet
the Press” on Sunday. “There is a history here in presidential elections
by the Russian Federation, by its intelligence services.”</p>
<p>Those concerns, however, have riled some lawmakers and conservative
commentators, who argue the White House is trying to resurrect what they
call the “Russia hoax” — the narrative voiced by many Democrats that
Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help former
President Donald Trump win.</p>
<p>Warner, talking to reporters, dismissed such arguments.</p>
<p>“Anyone who doesn’t think the Russian intel services have and will
continue to interfere in our elections … I wonder where they’re getting
their information to start with,” he said in response to a question from
VOA.</p>
<p>In a declassified intelligence report on the U.S. 2022 elections,
released late last year, the National Intelligence Council assessed with
high confidence that Russia, along with China and Iran, ran operations
that sought to influence the outcomes.</p>
<p>“The Russian Government and its proxies sought to denigrate the
Democratic Party before the midterm elections and undermine confidence
in the election, most likely to undermine U.S. support for Ukraine,” the
report said.</p>
<p>China targeted a “handful of midterm races involving members of both
U.S. political parties,” it added.</p>
<p>Both Russia and China have previously denied allegations of running
influence operations aimed at U.S. elections.</p>

Lawmakers, Officials Voice Concern About Chinese Police on Kiribati</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. lawmakers are voicing concern about the Pacific
island nation of Kirabati’s use of police from China for security, just
as the U.S. State Department warns that such cooperation could bring new
risks to Kiribati, a neighbor of Hawaii. </p>
<p>On Friday, Eeri Aritiera, Kirabati’s acting police commissioner, told
Reuters that a Chinese police delegation will rotate through the island
nation to “provide assistance” to Kiribati’s Community Policing program
and IT department. </p>
<p>Aritiera says the island nation of more than 115,000, whose closest
island is about 2,100 km (1,305 miles) from Hawaii, requested China’s
policing assistance in 2022. </p>
<p>In an email to VOA, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said the
U.S. conducts police training in Kiribati. The spokesperson also raised
concerns about the “potential implications that security agreements and
security-related cyber cooperation” with China may have for a nation’s
sovereignty. </p>
<p>“We do not believe importing security forces from [China] will help
any country,” he said in an email to VOA. </p>
<p>Worried about losing ground</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers worry Washington is losing ground to the People’s
Republic of China in the Pacific, a region that’s critical to national
security. </p>
<p>“The PRC’s policing activities in Kiribati are a clear sign of
Beijing’s growing influence in Pacific island countries through lawfare.
It’s also a sign of the democracy-eroding effects of the PRC’s
diplomatic isolation of Taiwan,” said U.S. Representative Raja
Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member on the House Select Committee on the
Strategic Competition Between the U.S. and the Chinese Communist Party
or CCP. </p>
<p>“If we don’t engage more with our Pacific partners like Kiribati to
counter this CCP malign influence, we could face serious trade and
national security issues, said U.S. Representative Neal Dunn, a Florida
Republican who also serves on the Select Committee. </p>
<p>“Kiribati wants a consistent on-the-ground relationship with the
United States,” acknowledged democratic U.S. Representative Ed Case of
Hawaii in an email to VOA, adding the region “needs help building
capacity to address basic services.”  </p>
<p>Others on the committee worry about the corrosive impact on Pacific
nations as they depend more for security on police from an authoritarian
state where due process often goes unenforced. </p>
<p>“The CCP gives zero value to human life and will most certainly
intend to use Kiribati’s strategic position to their advantage, said
U.S. Representative Michele Steel in a statement to VOA. Steel also
serves on the Select Committee. </p>
<p>VOA asked the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. to comment on the reports
about the new Chinese police presence in Kiribati. </p>
<p>Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu responded to VOA in an email
that China “always engages in cooperation with relevant countries on the
basis of equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit, openness and
inclusiveness.” </p>
<p>China grows police partnerships </p>
<p>In recent years, Beijing has increasingly positioned itself as the
public safety partner of choice for Pacific nations experiencing
instability. In January, Papua New Guinea requested Chinese police
assistance after riots killed 15 people. </p>
<p>In 2022, the Solomon Islands entered into a security pact with
Beijing, and a year later, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare signed a
police cooperation deal with China for two years. Both Kiribati and the
Solomons switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing in 2019. </p>
<p>But others in the region are re-examining their police agreements
with China. In January 2023, after 12 years of cooperation with Beijing
on policing, Fiji’s newly elected prime minister — Sitiveni Rabuka —
fired the country’s police commissioner and promised to end a police
training agreement that allowed Chinese police officers to be stationed
in Fiji. </p>
<p>“If our systems and our values differ, what cooperation can we get
from them?” said Rabuka last June, referring to China. </p>
<p>Lawmakers: Funding delay sends wrong message</p>
<p>With Chinese funds surging to the region — as much as $3.148 billion
between 2008 and 2020, according to the Sydney-based Lowy Institute —
many in Congress are questioning why their fellow lawmakers still
haven’t passed a funding package for three Pacific allies that are also
facing economic pressure from Beijing. </p>
<p>The agreement, known as the Compacts of Free Association or COFA,
provide $7 billion in economic aid over 20 years to Palau, Micronesia
and the Marshall Islands.  It was signed last year.  </p>
<p>Earlier this month, the funding was dropped from the security
supplemental in the U.S. Senate under pressure from conservatives who
wanted to lower costs. With no amendment process permitted, the funds
could not be added back in. </p>
<p>U.S. representative Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen represents the U.S.
Pacific territory of American Samoa — some 2,500 kilometers (1,553
miles) southeast of Kiribati. </p>
<p>In a statement to VOA, she called COFA “the clearest signal the U.S.
can send renewing American commitments to freedom, democracy and
well-being for our three closest allies, and the entire Pacific region.”
 </p>
<p>U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii agrees, warning in an email to
VOA that further delay in passing COFA “opens the door for China to make
similar overtures to the COFA nations.”</p>

<h2 id="electric-semis-are-hitting-the-road-in-california">Electric
Semis Are Hitting the Road in California</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTU2OTQwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODExMjczN30.J5VVko3Xajj7kZQY_ip8d06E-HcKJdvcz4EY3Xnh5CY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Deep in the Inland Empire, the vast sprawl of suburbia that extends
eastward from Los Angeles, the battery-powered semi trucks are about to
start their run. They navigate the congested freeways of L.A. County to
the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, load or unload, and then
complete the round trip to trucking company NFI’s warehouse in Ontario,
California. When the day’s run is done, the truck adjourns to the
brand-new charging depot next door to fill up its battery for tomorrow’s
trip.
</p>
<p>
These trucks are part of a project called the Joint Electric Truck
Scaling Initiative, or
<a href="https://www.jetsiproject.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JETSI</a>.
Funded by a handful of state sustainability agencies, the project aims
to prove that electric power really can replace dirty diesel for
trucking, at least for regional runs. Soon, about 100 electric trucks
divided between two shipping companies will be driving around Southern
California, delivering cargo while discovering just how challenging it
will be for American trucking to run on battery power.
</p>
<p>
JETSI took a big leap toward its goal this week as NFI, one of two
companies that will operate the electric semis, opened a 50-stall
high-power charging depot next to its Ontario warehouse.
</p>
<p>
Jim O’Leary, vice president of fleet services at NFI, told me his
company had already installed a handful of chargers and run a few EV
semis as part of early initiatives such as the
<a href="https://northamerica.daimlertruck.com/PressDetail/battery-electric-freightliner-innovation-fleet-logs-2020-07-31/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Daimler
Innovation Fleet</a>, a recent test project in which Freightliner EV
semi drive hundreds of thousands of test miles. When California wanted a
more ambitious test of electric trucking, he said, he thought NFI’s
operations were an ideal match.
</p>
<p>
Electric semis still have a relatively short range and long recharge
times, so battery power may not work for long-haul trucking — not for a
while anyway. One of NFI’s core businesses, however, is “drayage,” or
moving shipping containers on the back of semi trucks between a port and
a warehouse. The current slate of EV trucks can make this 110- to
120-mile round trip before needing to recharge. Once they’re done, it
takes 90 to 120 minutes to power up again.
</p>
<p>
“What we realized was going to be the sweet spot for electrification was
this short haul, returning to the home base,” O’Leary said.
“Electrification would be kind of perfect for that application.”
</p>
<p>
To streamline the operation, NFI was able to buy the plot of land next
to its warehouse for the charging depot, negating the hassle of trucks
making a separate trip to plug in. O’Leary said the company plans to
install 1 megawatt of solar generating capacity on site. That’s not
enough to charge the trucks on sun power, but it is enough to fill up
the on-site batteries during the day when the trucks are out working,
and then use the saved juice to help charge the vehicles later in the
day when the sun has gone down.
</p>
<p>
While that sounds rosy, the purpose of a pilot project is to discover
the pain points. With EV trucking, there are plenty. First: weight. The
huge batteries needed to power a semi impart a serious weight penalty.
Even though the state gives an extra allowance for zero-emission
vehicles, O’Leary said (they may
<a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/all?state=CA#:~:text=ZEVs%20and%20near%2DZEVs%20may,system%2C%20up%20to%202%2C000%20pounds." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exceed</a>
the state’s weight limits by 2,000 lbs), they’re just not a great choice
for carrying heavy cargo. That means shippers have to be careful about
what they say they can move. “You can’t really haul beverage like you
would a diesel,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Maintenance is a question mark. As Heatmap has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-maintenance-tesla-tires" target="_blank">noted
before</a>, passenger EVs don’t need the same kind of basic upkeep as
gasoline cars — no oil changes, no spark plug swaps. But because today’s
EVs haven’t gotten old yet, we don’t know for sure how their components
will age over a decade or two. The same is true for EV tractor-trailers.
“We know that some of the wearables go away — the oil changes and the
need to grease,” O’Leary said. But no one can be sure whether electric
semis will save money on maintenance in the long term.
</p>
<p>
Then there’s the question of who’s going to fix them. A trucking company
has enough certified mechanics on hand to repair run-down trucks and get
them back on the road. Finding enough mechanics with the proper
electrical safety certifications and know-how to repair EVs is no easy
task.
</p>
<p>
The big one, of course, is the cost. NFI’s JETSI project cost $45
million all-in, O’Leary said, counting the land purchase, the chargers
from Electrify America, the solar power equipment and backup batteries,
the trucks, and everything else. California state agencies including
California Air Resources Board, California Energy Commission, and South
Coast Air Quality Management District gave money to fund this
proof-of-concept, and California cap-and-trade dollars could contribute
to electrifying the trucking industry in the future. But JETSI shows
just how many hurdles are involved.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to say we were shortsighted, because I think you
<em>can’t</em> be shortsighted when you undertake a project like this,
and you’re obviously looking to the future in some ways,” he said. “But
I don’t think any of us, or our partners, realized the complexities that
this project is going to have. Not only the complexities, but the
capital investment that it takes to actually make a project like this
work. And that’s where I think we are still a ways away from this being
the norm.”

<p class="drop-caps">
There is basically no original way left to complain about Congress.
Bemoaning our elected officials is the most American of pastimes; pretty
much as long as we’ve been a country, we’ve been
<a href="https://firstamendmentmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6.-Congressional-Pugilists-scaled.jpeg" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cringing
at</a> the people who run it.
</p>
<p>
Lately, though, things have felt bleakly unfunny. Gerrymandering and
tribalism have
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/09/politics/congress-majorities-what-matters/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cleaved</a>
Congress into warring halves, making
<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bipartisanship-in-the-senate-is-dying/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bipartisanship
politically suicidal</a>. The three-week House Speaker vacancy last fall
exposed the legislative branch as the most dysfunctional it’s been in
its quarter-millennium of existence. Lawmakers accomplished less in 2023
than any other time in the past 50 years, and experts predict 2024
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/07/congress-republicans-trump-house-legislation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">will
be even worse</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s a bad time to be someone who needs a bill passed, in other words.
Like, say, a federal wildland firefighter.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2022, in the flush times after the passage of the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law, President Biden allotted $600 million toward
increasing the pay of federal firefighters, who made as little as $13 an
hour at the time. The BIL boost was not insignificant: it bumped the
starting wage to $15 an hour, and current firefighters received an
annual pay increase of up to $20,000 that was retroactive to the year
before.
</p>
<p>
The raise had always been intended to be temporary, serving as a “bridge
for two years as the administration works with Congress on longer-term
reforms,” the Biden administration explained
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-pay-raises-supports-for-wildland-firefighter-workforce-from-bipartisan-infrastructure-law/#:~:text=Under%20President%20Biden's%202021%20initiatives,a%20cost%20of%20%2424.3%20million." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">at
the time</a>. That ran out last September — just in time for the
government to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/kevin-mccarthy-speaker.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">implode</a>
spectacularly.
</p>
<p>
Congress had actually been working on a permanent fix last summer, the
Wildland Firefighter Paycheck Protection Act. A rare bipartisan piece of
legislation, it was introduced by Arizona’s Independent Senator Kyrsten
Sinema and
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/inside-fs/delivering-mission/excel/firefighter-pay" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">would
mean a</a> lasting increase to the base pay for Forest Service and
Department of the Interior wildland firefighters, plus add new premium
pay for those who respond to high-hazard fire incidents.
</p>
<p>
The bill cruised through the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee on a 10-1 vote, with only Republican Rand Paul
concern-trolling about
<a href="https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2023/07/senate-panel-has-advanced-legislation-avert-wildland-firefighter-pay-cliff/388698/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
deficit</a>. But it never even made it to committee in a
Republican-controlled House
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/05/politics/congress-wrestles-over-firefighter-pay/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">obsessed
with spending cuts</a>. “There was a window where it could have been
brought up for a vote that they pretty much missed,” Riva Duncan, a
wildland firefighter of more than 30 years who serves as the executive
secretary of
<a href="https://www.grassrootswildlandfirefighters.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Grassroots
Wildland Firefighters</a>, an industry advocacy group, told me.
</p>
<p>
Since the temporary pay bump expired in September, Congress has extended
firefighters’ salaries three times using continuing resolutions, which
means that every few months, there are headlines about how the force is
on
<a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2024/02/21/federal-wildland-firefighters-pay-congress/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
brink of losing half their pay</a>. The current supplement — and funding
for
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/us/politics/biden-congress-shutdown.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
government more broadly</a> — is set to expire March 8, and Congress
will probably bridge it with a fourth extension as the bill continues to
flounder and the larger budget fights continue.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the 2024 fire season is already starting to heat up. Several
states were under
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/february-extreme-weather-whiplash" target="_self">red
flag warnings</a> on Monday and Tuesday, with smoke from wildfires in
the Great Plains and south drifting
<a href="https://longisland.news12.com/wildfire-smoke-returns-to-tri-state-due-to-major-fires-in-southern-us" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">as
far as New York City</a>. And it’s <em>February</em>. Things will only
get worse as the spring dries into the summer.
</p>
<p>
For the
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/02/19/1232383867/wildfire-managers-trying-to-staff-up-for-this-years-season-face-many-issues?fbclid=PAAaZfUj_vfArdF2uDzEVh-31QQwvReOjy2zHMewHhfi4PlBXKbwpgTRv6ehQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">17,000
or so</a> firefighters affected, the uncertainty means their lives hang
in a sort of limbo. Retirement accounts are suspended until Congress can
work out a solution. Additionally, “a lot of people who have tried to
get a loan, whether it’s for a vehicle or to buy a house or to move and
pay rent — they can’t count on the supplement,” Duncan said. “So that
really affects them, not having a plannable income.”
</p>
<p>
Needless to say, “morale is pretty low right now,” Duncan went on. It’s
not an appealing time to be a federal firefighter, particularly when
many state and private firefighting agencies can offer you actual
financial stability (not to mention wages that are often higher).
According to an assessment by the National Federation of Federal
Employees, as much as

of the 11,000-strong Forest Service firefighters corps could start to
look for other work if a permanent fix doesn’t happen soon. And if that
comes to be, then “communities will burn, and people will die,” NFFE
National President Randy Erwin warned in a
<a href="https://nffe.org/press-release/nffe-praises-introduction-of-bipartisan-house-companion-bill-to-prevent-fiscal-pay-cliff-for-federal-wildland-firefighters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">statement</a>
last summer.
</p>
<p>
That’s because federal firefighters do things that other crews, simply,
can’t. “The federal government … provides advanced-skill units not
offered by state or private entities, such as hotshot crews,
smokejumpers, rappellers, helitack crews, and wildland fire modules” —
that is, specialist teams that are critical for fighting fires in this
new era of extreme weather — Colorado’s Democratic Congressman Joe
Neguse, the co-chair of the Bipartisan Wildfire Caucus, wrote in
<a href="https://neguse.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-neguse-urges-congressional-action-advance-federal-firefighter-pay-cliff#:~:text=The%20Bipartisan%20Wildland%20Firefighter%20Paycheck,a%20high%2Dfire%20risk%20area" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
letter</a> last fall.
</p>
<p>
Retirements and defections from skill-based work like firefighting are
especially damaging because with every senior departure goes the kind of
on-the-job expertise that green new hires can’t replace. But that’s
<em>if </em>there are new hires in the first place. Rumors abound that
the agencies are struggling to fill their openings even this late in the
training cycle, with
<a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-lofgren-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-raise-overtime-pay-cap-for-wildland-firefighters/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
known vacancy rate of 20%</a> in the Forest Service force alone.
</p>
<p>
To help its remaining workers make ends meet, the Forest Service has
been paying firefighter wages out of its fire suppression fund, which is
usually used on actual fires. In the DOI, the stopgap money comes from
its preparedness fund, which is intended for day-to-day expenses. That
has been working in the short term. But “if we have a big fire season,
which in an El Niño year, usually we do — we know that there’s a lot
less snow in the Rockies and the Sierra this year — then that pot of
money for suppression, it’s not bottomless. It is a finite pot of
money,” Duncan said. Agencies and lawmakers think, “‘Well, they’re
making it work, so they don’t really need a permanent pay raise,’” she
added. “But this is not a tenable situation.”
</p>
<p>
Each year, an average of 17 wildland firefighters
<a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/sites/default/files/publications/pms841.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">die</a>
in the line of duty. Climate change
<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/noaa-wildfire/wildfire-climate-connection#:~:text=Drought%20and%20persistent%20heat%20set,million%20acres%20burned%20since%202016." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">doubled
the number</a> of large fires in the West between 1984 and 2015. And
last year saw the deadliest wildfire in modern U.S. history in a place
that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/how-invasive-plants-fueled-an-inferno-in-maui" target="_self">wasn’t
supposed to burn</a>.
</p>
<p>
Firefighter pay, by all appearances, should be the rare issue on the
Hill that lawmakers more or less agree on. No one wants to see
communities burned to the ground, cities
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/wildfire-smoke-worst-history-nyc" target="_self">filled
with smoke</a>, or the people who risk their lives to contain such
dramatic natural disasters go underpaid. The bill is about as close to a
no-brainer as you can get in these divisive times, and Duncan feels sure
that if it went to a vote, it would pass. But Congress remains
distracted and obstinate. As long as the permanent bill is stalled and
continuing resolutions are used as short-term fixes, federal
firefighters will continue to feel undervalued or, worse, forgotten.

Warren Buffett Thinks the Era of Private Utilities Is Over</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTU3NDQ0NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0Nzg2MDIzNH0.xpoUlVr6_Xes6L3KX-OhP9YEVP8hOZLZNTm0zj4eYEQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Warren Buffet, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and investing folk
hero, has long had a rule for picking which companies to invest in.
</p>
<p>
“The most important thing [is] trying to find a business with a wide and
long-lasting moat around it … protecting a terrific economic castle with
an honest lord in charge of the castle,” he
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/07/warren-buffett-believes-this-is-the-most-important-thing-to-find-in-a-business.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
a CNBC crowd</a> in 1995. He has embellished the metaphor over the years
— in some versions, sharks populate the moat — but the idea is the same.
Seek out companies with a natural competitive advantage, even an
inherent monopoly, and prosperity will follow.
</p>
<p>
For decades, investor-owned gas and electricity utilities have struck
Buffett as businesses with a good moat. Over the years, Buffett has
bought up a handful of utilities, including MidAmerican Energy Company
in the Great Plains, NV Energy in Nevada, and PacifiCorp in the Mountain
West and Pacific Northwest. Their climate record is mixed: The Berkshire
utilities
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/21/berkshire-hathaway-is-about-to-hit-a-big-renewable-energy-milestone.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">generate
more power from renewables</a> than the national average, but still
operate
<a href="https://www.pacificorp.com/energy/thermal.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">several
coal plants</a> in Utah and Wyoming. Berkshire Hathaway says its
utilities and pipeline companies serve about 12 million end customers in
North America and the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
But Buffett’s faith in for-profit utilities as a sound and stable
business is failing. In his latest letter to investors — an annual
tradition known for its plain writing and folksy anecdotes — Buffett
says that the future of for-profit utilities looks more ominous. Climate
change and what he sees as higher regulatory standards are making it
harder for utilities to make money, he says.
</p>
<p>
He’s speaking in part from personal experience. Last year, an Oregon
jury
<a href="https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/local/oregon/2023/06/12/jury-finds-pacificorp-at-fault-labor-day-fires-santiam-canyon-echo-mountain-242/70313925007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">found
PacifiCorp liable</a> for negligence that resulted in the start of four
wildfires during Labor Day weekend in 2020. A series of “mini-trials”
have since awarded at least $175 million to the fires’ victims, with
more trials yet to come. These results didn’t take Berkshire Energy into
the red — Berkshire’s utility businesses earned $2.3 billion last year —
but it did result in much worse financial performance than 2022.
</p>
<p>
In his letter, Buffett says that “most” of the company’s utility
businesses have done as expected. But he adds:
</p>
<blockquote>
[T]he regulatory climate in a few states has raised the specter of zero
profitability or even bankruptcy (an actual outcome at California’s
largest utility and a current threat in Hawaii). In such jurisdictions,
it is difficult to project both earnings and asset values in what was
once regarded as among the most stable industries in America.
<br/><br/>For more than a century, electric utilities raised huge sums
to finance their growth through a state-by-state promise of a fixed
return on equity (sometimes with a small bonus for superior
performance). With this approach, massive investments were made for
capacity that would likely be required a few years down the road. That
forward-looking regulation reflected the reality that utilities build
generating and transmission assets that often take many years to
construct. BHE’s extensive multi-state transmission project in the West
was initiated in 2006 and remains some years from completion.
Eventually, it will serve 10 states comprising 30% of the acreage in the
continental United States. <br/><br/>With this model employed by both
private and public-power systems, the lights stayed on, even if
population growth or industrial demand exceeded expectations. The
“margin of safety” approach seemed sensible to regulators, investors and
the public. Now, the fixed-but-satisfactory return pact has been broken
in a few states, and investors are becoming apprehensive that such
ruptures may spread. Climate change adds to their worries. Underground
transmission may be required but who, a few decades ago, wanted to pay
the staggering costs for such construction? <br/><br/>At Berkshire, we
have made a best estimate for the amount of losses that have occurred.
These costs arose from forest fires, whose frequency and intensity have
increased – and will likely continue to increase – if convective storms
become more frequent.<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>
He later continues:<br/>
</p>
<blockquote>
Whatever the case at Berkshire, the final result for the utility
industry may be ominous: Certain utilities might no longer attract the
savings of American citizens and will be forced to adopt the
public-power model. Nebraska made this choice in the 1930s and there are
many public-power operations throughout the country. Eventually, voters,
taxpayers and users will decide which model they prefer. When the dust
settles, America’s power needs and the consequent capital expenditure
will be staggering. I did not anticipate or even consider the adverse
developments in regulatory returns and, along with Berkshire’s two
partners at BHE, I made a costly mistake in not doing so.
</blockquote>
<p>
As has been
<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/warren-buffett-blasts-government-regulations-annual-letter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/24/business/dealbook/berkshire-hathaway-annual-report.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>,
Buffett is criticizing government regulation in this letter. But even if
he has reached his conclusion spitefully, it is not necessarily wrong.
In the coming years, America’s utilities will have to overhaul their
infrastructure to decarbonize their power plants while also girding
themselves against climate change’s effects. Both projects are
expensive.
</p>
<p>
For years, most public officials have more or less assumed that the
for-profit model is the <em>best</em> way to ensure such maintenance and
upgrading get done in a timely and efficient fashion. But that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/what-is-public-power-utilities-maine-ann-arbor-san-francisco" target="_self">may
no longer be</a> feasible or desirable.

<h2 id="on-posse">On POSSE</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
<strong>P</strong>ublish (on your) <strong>O</strong>wn
<strong>S</strong>ite, <strong>S</strong>yndicate
<strong>E</strong>lsewhere. It’s one of the principles of the
<a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">IndieWeb</a>. It’s the idea that
your content should live on your site, on a domain name you own and you
should then distribute that content in as many places as possible.
Overall it’s a nice idea but one I never felt compelled to make mine.
</p>
<p>
My content lives here, on my site. Everything in here is under my
control and it’s then distributed through three distribution channels.
</p>
<p>
The first—and most obvious—is the web itself. My content is distributed
to you via the Internet. You can ask your browser to get this page
you’re reading right now and get access to my content.
</p>
<p>
The second is RSS. You can tell your RSS reader to fetch the content
available on my website and you can then consume my content inside your
app of choice.
</p>
<p>
The final one is email. I send my posts via email because some people
prefer to stay up to date that way and who am I to prevent that from
happening?
</p>
<p>
But these three methods only take care of distribution and distribution
of content is only part of the equation. You then have interaction. The
point of putting content out there is to connect, to interact with
others, to exchange ideas, and to grow. And interactions, in my world,
happen via email. 95% of the interactions I have happen via email with
the occasional message on iMessage. Both of those communication methods
are always monitored because they live on my Mac and my phone.
</p>
<p>
Now, what if I were to follow the POSSE mantra? I’d probably sign up for
a bunch of different services and scatter my content everywhere there
are people. But those people might then comment and try to get in touch
with me on those platforms. Platforms I’d then have to monitor. And I
don’t know about you, but I don’t have time for that. And if I don’t
check them, those are lost connections, missed opportunities to interact
with other human beings.
</p>
<p>
That to me is a terrible outcome and it’s why don’t want to distribute
my content outside of those three channels. But maybe I’m wrong so if
you have a different opinion please reach out.

Swiss company Micro has just unveiled a production version of its
Microlino Lite – an even smaller version of its Microlino microcar –
this week at the Geneva Motor Show. It won’t go faster than 28 mph (45

<h2 id="apple-killed-music-on-the-move-for-me">2024-02-07 Apple killed
music on the move, for me</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
2024-02-07 Apple killed music on the move, for me
</h1>
<p>
I was thinking about joining the
<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/cool-tech-zone/tangara">Tangara</a>
crowdfunding. It’s a kind of iPod, but better in that it is all open.
Yay!
</p>
<p>
But then I realized something: Having an iPhone made listening to music
such a shit show that I basically stopped and switched my entire
phone-based audio entertainment to podcasts. Because podcast clients are
great (at least <a href="https://icatcher.app/about/">iCatcher</a> is)
where as Apple Music is a pain. Having used iTunes when it was cool
until it was unusable, and then realizing what a pain the weird AAC
formats on the files were, and the DRM on some of them, preventing me
from playing them on other machines I owned. I was so angry.
</p>
<p>
In a fit of hate I decided I was going to
<a href="2019-07-08_Apple_Photos">move all my pictures out of
iPhotos</a> and all my music out of iTunes and never go back. And I did.
And so the Apple Music app died, and I guess no alternatives were
allowed on the App Store because Apple is great like that, and so when
the iPod classic I had with
<a href="2017-12-21_Rockbox_on_the_iPod">Rockbox</a> installed
<a href="2022-11-18_iPod%2C_iPad%2C_iPhone%2C_iPiss">finally died</a>,
all I was left with was podcasts on the iPhone.
</p>
<p>
And so now I don’t even know whether I want to listen to music any more
while I’m on the move.
</p>
<p>
Apple killed music on the move, for me.
</p>
<p>
At home it’s a different story, of course, but Tangara is a portable
music player.
</p>
<p>
I wish Tangara the best of luck.

<p>
<strong>2024-02-27</strong>. I joined the Kickstarter. Not because I
have a terribly good feeling about it but because I remember wanting a
portable audio player and I recently found, once again, that I really
hate the Apple Music app.

This week has already been a wild one for U.S. weather, as what is

to be the warmest February on record comes to a close. Many states in
the Midwest and South experienced a heatwave yesterday that brought
record high winter temperatures. It was 65 degrees Fahrenheit in

for example, where the normal high is 33. Parts of Texas saw
temperatures soar into the 90s. In Chicago, where February temperatures
usually sit in the low 30s at best, it was a balmy 60 degrees yesterday.
The warm weather brought with it wind gusts and

risks</a>, and red flag warnings were in place from Texas to Missouri.
</p>
<p>
But prepare for some weather whiplash: A cold front is advancing east,
and will plunge some of those warmer states into frigid temperatures.
Grand Forks, North Dakota, for example, won’t see temperatures rise

Maine’s Can-Am Crown International Sled Dog Race, the longest such race
in the eastern United States, due to lack of snow. Since 1992, the
250-mile trek has taken place in snowy northern Maine, but this year the
region has seen just over half the typical amount of snowfall. “The
unique challenges presented by the lack of snow have led us to conclude
that moving forward with this year’s race could compromise the
well-being of all involved,” wrote Can-Am President Dennis Cyr. “It is a
decision made with heavy hearts but necessary caution.” National Weather
Service meteorologist Joe Wegman
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=57905d8c6a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
the lack of snow across parts of the country is creating a feedback
loop: “Most of the eastern two-thirds of the country has had a
relatively snow-less winter, so the ground is bare and dry. So we’re
getting much warmer temperatures just due to solar radiation.”

<li>Report: First Solar helped create 16,000 U.S. jobs in 2023
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>First Solar, the largest solar panel manufacturer in
America, has been a boon for the nation’s economy, according to
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=84cdc68dec&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">analysis</a>
from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette’s Kathleen Babineaux
Blanco Public Policy Center and commissioned by the company. The report
found that First Solar had 2,700 people on payroll in 2023, but because
“each First Solar job ends up supporting six more jobs throughout the
U.S. economy,” the company had a trickle-down effect of supporting some
16,000 jobs, <em>Electrek</em>’s Michelle Lewis
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a1beb23297&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>.
The company added $2.75 billion in value and $5.32 billion in output to
the U.S. economy last year. By 2026, those numbers are expected to climb
to $4.99 billion and $10.18 billion, respectively, as the company
expands its solar capacity. First Solar is “a fully vertically
integrated manufacturer of thin-film PV solar panels,” Lewis said. “This
means they can turn a sheet of glass into a functional solar panel in
about four hours, relying heavily on U.S.-sourced materials like glass
and steel.”

<li>Oil and gas profits triple during Biden presidency

<p>
<strong></strong>Major U.S. oil and gas producers have seen profits
nearly triple during President Biden’s presidency as production has
soared,
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=11360807fa&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
the <em>Financial Times</em>. The 10 most valuable operators – including
ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and others – amassed a combined net
income of $313 billion between 2020 and 2023, up from $112 billion
during the same period of Donald Trump’s presidency. “The outperformance
under Biden underlines the limited role of the White House in dictating
the sector’s fortunes.” But it still won’t look great on his resume as
he seeks to bolster support from climate-conscious progressives heading
into the 2024 election. Biden ran “the most ambitious climate platform
of any U.S. president in history,” and has indeed taken aim at the oil
and gas industry during his tenure, the <em>FT</em> wrote. But he has
also pushed to keep production high in the face of inflation and energy
shocks.

<li>Carbon removal startup Equatic to build demonstration plant in
Singapore
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Carbon removal startup Equatic confirmed today that it
is building a $20 million plant in Singapore to demonstrate the
company’s technology, <em>Bloomberg</em>
<a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0d3719cf30&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.
Equatic uses electrolysis to permanently remove carbon dioxide from
seawater, enabling it to absorb more of the greenhouse gas from the air.
The process also creates hydrogen as a byproduct. The company already
has two smaller pilot plants in operation, but the new one will be
different for a few reasons: First, it’s much bigger – when complete, it
could rival the annual carbon capturing capabilities of Climeworks,
currently the world’s biggest carbon removal plant. Second, it will use
a new proprietary process that doesn’t produce harmful chlorine gas. And
third, it will mark a step toward commercialization as the company looks
to scale and find more buyers. Boeing is among its most prominent
customers, committing to pay the company to remove 62,000 tons of CO2
and produce 2,100 tons of hydrogen. Equatic plans to eventually build a
commercial-scale plant that it claims will remove 100,000 tons of CO2
per year.

Hypothetical AI election disinformation risks vs real AI harms (27 Feb
2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Hypothetical AI election disinformation risks vs real
AI harms: And those real AI harms are priming people to believe
disinformation. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in
history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications,

Hypothetical AI election disinformation risks vs real AI harms
(permalink) You can barely turn around these days without encountering a
think-piece warning of the impending risk of AI disinformation in the
coming elections. But a recent episode of This Machine Kills podcast
reminds us that these are hypothetical risks, and there is no shortage
of real AI harms:
https://soundcloud.com/thismachinekillspod/311-selling-pickaxes-for-the-ai-gold-rush
The algorithmic decision-making systems that increasingly run the
back-ends to our lives are really, truly very bad at doing their jobs,
and worse, these systems constitute a form of “empiricism-washing”: if
the computer says it’s true, it must be true. There’s no such thing as
racist math, you SJW snowflake!
https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/02/aoc-algorithms-racist-bias.html
Nearly 1,000 British postmasters were wrongly convicted of fraud by
Horizon, the faulty AI fraud-hunting system that Fujitsu provided to the
Royal Mail. They had their lives ruined by this faulty AI, many went to
prison, and at least four of the AI’s victims killed themselves:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Post_Office_scandal Tenants across
America have seen their rents skyrocket thanks to Realpage’s landlord
price-fixing algorithm, which deployed the time-honored defense: “It’s
not a crime if we commit it with an app”:
https://www.propublica.org/article/doj-backs-tenants-price-fixing-case-big-landlords-real-estate-tech
Housing, you’ll recall, is pretty foundational in the human hierarchy of
needs. Losing your home – or being forced to choose between paying rent
or buying groceries or gas for your car or clothes for your kid – is a
non-hypothetical, widespread, urgent problem that can be traced straight
to AI. Then there’s predictive policing: cities across America and the
world have bought systems that purport to tell the cops where to look
for crime. Of course, these systems are trained on policing data from
forces that are seeking to correct racial bias in their practices by
using an algorithm to create “fairness.” You feed this algorithm a
data-set of where the police had detected crime in previous years, and
it predicts where you’ll find crime in the years to come. But you only
find crime where you look for it. If the cops only ever stop-and-frisk
Black and brown kids, or pull over Black and brown drivers, then every
knife, baggie or gun they find in someone’s trunk or pockets will be
found in a Black or brown person’s trunk or pocket. A predictive
policing algorithm will naively ingest this data and confidently assert
that future crimes can be foiled by looking for more Black and brown
people and searching them and pulling them over. Obviously, this is bad
for Black and brown people in low-income neighborhoods, whose baseline
risk of an encounter with a cop turning violent or even lethal. But it’s
also bad for affluent people in affluent neighborhoods – because they
are underpoliced as a result of these algorithmic biases. For example,
domestic abuse that occurs in full detached single-family homes is
systematically underrepresented in crime data, because the majority of
domestic abuse calls originate with neighbors who can hear the abuse
take place through a shared wall. But the majority of algorithmic harms
are inflicted on poor, racialized and/or working class people. Even if
you escape a predictive policing algorithm, a facial recognition
algorithm may wrongly accuse you of a crime, and even if you were far
away from the site of the crime, the cops will still arrest you, because
computers don’t lie:
https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/texas-macys-sunglass-hut-facial-recognition-software-wrongful-arrest-sacramento-alibi/
Trying to get a low-waged service job? Be prepared for endless,
nonsensical AI “personality tests” that make Scientology look like NASA:
https://futurism.com/mandatory-ai-hiring-tests Service workers’
schedules are at the mercy of shift-allocation algorithms that assign
them hours that ensure that they fall just short of qualifying for
health and other benefits. These algorithms push workers into
“clopening” – where you close the store after midnight and then open it
again the next morning before 5AM. And if you try to unionize, another
algorithm – that spies on you and your fellow workers’ social media
activity – targets you for reprisals and your store for closure. If
you’re driving an Amazon delivery van, algorithm watches your eyeballs
and tells your boss that you’re a bad driver if it doesn’t like what it
sees. If you’re working in an Amazon warehouse, an algorithm decides if
you’ve taken too many pee-breaks and automatically dings you:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/04/17/revenge-of-the-chickenized-reverse-centaurs/
If this disgusts you and you’re hoping to use your ballot to elect
lawmakers who will take up your cause, an algorithm stands in your way
again. “AI” tools for purging voter rolls are especially harmful to
racialized people – for example, they assume that two “Juan Gomez”es
with a shared birthday in two different states must be the same person
and remove one or both from the voter rolls:
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eligible-voters-swept-up-conservative-activists-purge-voter-rolls/
Hoping to get a solid education, the sort that will keep you out of
AI-supervised, precarious, low-waged work? Sorry, kiddo: the ed-tech
system is riddled with algorithms. There’s the grifty “remote
invigilation” industry that watches you take tests via webcam and
accuses you of cheating if your facial expressions fail its high-tech
phrenology standards:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/16/unauthorized-paper/#cheating-anticheat
All of these are non-hypothetical, real risks from AI. The AI industry
has proven itself incredibly adept at deflecting interest from real
harms to hypothetical ones, like the “risk” that the spicy autocomplete
will become conscious and take over the world in order to convert us all
to paperclips:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space
Whenever you hear AI bosses talking about how seriously they’re taking a
hypothetical risk, that’s the moment when you should check in on whether
they’re doing anything about all these longstanding, real risks. And
even as AI bosses promise to fight hypothetical election disinformation,
they continue to downplay or ignore the non-hypothetical, here-and-now
harms of AI. There’s something unseemly – and even perverse – about
worrying so much about AI and election disinformation. It plays into the
narrative that kicked off in earnest in 2016, that the reason the
electorate votes for manifestly unqualified candidates who run on a
platform of bald-faced lies is that they are gullible and easily led
astray. But there’s another explanation: the reason people accept
conspiratorial accounts of how our institutions are run is because the
institutions that are supposed to be defending us are corrupt and
captured by actual conspiracies:
https://memex.craphound.com/2019/09/21/republic-of-lies-the-rise-of-conspiratorial-thinking-and-the-actual-conspiracies-that-fuel-it/
The party line on conspiratorial accounts is that these institutions are
good, actually. Think of the rebuttal offered to anti-vaxxers who
claimed that pharma giants were run by murderous sociopath billionaires
who were in league with their regulators to kill us for a buck: “no, I
think you’ll find pharma companies are great and superbly regulated”:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/05/not-that-naomi/#if-the-naomi-be-klein-youre-doing-just-fine
Institutions are profoundly important to a high-tech society. No one is
capable of assessing all the life-or-death choices we make every day,
from whether to trust the firmware in your car’s anti-lock brakes, the
alloys used in the structural members of your home, or the food-safety
standards for the meal you’re about to eat. We must rely on
well-regulated experts to make these calls for us, and when the
institutions fail us, we are thrown into a state of epistemological
chaos. We must make decisions about whether to trust these technological
systems, but we can’t make informed choices because the one thing we’re
sure of is that our institutions aren’t trustworthy. Ironically, the
long list of AI harms that we live with every day are the most important
contributor to disinformation campaigns. It’s these harms that provide
the evidence for belief in conspiratorial accounts of the world, because
each one is proof that the system can’t be trusted. The election
disinformation discourse focuses on the lies told – and not why those
lies are credible. That’s because the subtext of election disinformation
concerns is usually that the electorate is credulous, fools waiting to
be suckered in. By refusing to contemplate the institutional failures
that sit upstream of conspiracism, we can smugly locate the blame with
the peddlers of lies and assume the mantle of paternalistic protectors
of the easily gulled electorate. But the group of people who are
demonstrably being tricked by AI is the people who buy the horrifically
flawed AI-based algorithmic systems and put them into use despite their
manifest failures. As I’ve written many times, “we’re nowhere near a
place where bots can steal your job, but we’re certainly at the point
where your boss can be suckered into firing you and replacing you with a
bot that fails at doing your job”
https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/15/passive-income-brainworms/#four-hour-work-week
The most visible victims of AI disinformation are the people who are
putting AI in charge of the life-chances of millions of the rest of us.
Tackle that AI disinformation and its harms, and we’ll make
conspiratorial claims about our institutions being corrupt far less
credible. (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look at this

history and english majors, is considered irrelevant or optional, or
maybe kind of cute, by the typical reporter. So she expresses tech in
terms the journalists understand, therefore they like her.</p>

Hacked</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, updated: 2024-02-26, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Last week, someone posted something like 570 files, images and chat logs
from a Chinese company called I-Soon. I-Soon sells hacking and espionage
services to Chinese national and local government.

These aren’t details about the tools or techniques, more the inner
workings of the company. And they seem to primarily be hacking
regionally.

wants to update your Windows 11 PC without forcing you to reboot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>If there’s one thing Windows users hate about Windows, it’s Windows
updates interrupting your workflow or gaming session with a popup asking
you to restart your PC finish installing the latest security update. It
happens at least once a month, because that’s how often Microsoft rolls
out security updates to Windows PCs. This may soon be a thing of the
past, as the company is now testing an update method called “hot
patching” for Windows 11 PCs. Hot patching is already in use on some
Windows Server editions, as well as Xbox, and now it appears the company
is preparing to bring it to devices running Windows 11. ↫ Zac Bowden at
Windows Central A welcome, good improvement every Windows user is going
to benefit from. This is the kind of improvements Microsoft should
really be focusing on, instead of adding more ads or useless “AI”
features.</p>

<h2 id="a-history-of-the-tty">A history of the tty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: OS News</p>
<p>It’s one of those anachronisms that is deeply embedded in modern
technology. From cloud operator servers to embedded controllers in
appliances, there must be uncountable devices that think they are
connected to a TTY. I will omit the many interesting details of the
Linux terminal infrastructure here, as it could easily fill its own
article. But most Linux users are at least peripherally aware that the
kernel tends to identify both serial devices and terminals as TTYs,
assigning them filesystem names in the form of /dev/tty*. Probably a lot
of those people remember that this stands for teletype or perhaps
teletypewriter, although in practice the term teleprinter is more
common. ↫ J. B. Crawford I remember first using Linux in like 2000 or
2001, and running into the abbreviation tty, and not having a single
clue what that meant since I came from a DOS and Windows background.
Over time I gained a lot more understanding of the structure of modern
UNIX-like systems, but it’s still great to read such a detailed history
of the concept.</p>

<h2 id="renewal-of-us-china-science-and-tech-pact-faces-hurdles">Renewal
of US-China Science and Tech Pact Faces Hurdles</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — With a science and technology agreement between
the United States and People’s Republic of China due to expire Tuesday,
the State Department said it is negotiating to “amend, extend, and
strengthen protections within” the agreement but declined to specify if
the U.S. would extend the deal.</p>
<p>“We are not able to provide information at this time on specific U.S.
negotiating positions or on whether the agreement will be extended past
its current expiration date,” a State Department spokesperson told
VOA.</p>
<p>The Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement is a framework for
U.S. governmental collaborations with China in science and technology.
 </p>
<p>U.S. officials have said the STA provides consistent standards for
government-to-government scientific cooperation between the U.S. and
China.  </p>
<p>While the agreement supports scientific collaboration in areas that
benefit the United States, U.S. officials acknowledge the challenges
posed by China’s national science and technology strategies and its
domestic legal framework.</p>
<p>Critics, including U.S. lawmakers, point out China’s restrictions on
data and a lack of transparency in sharing scientific findings.
Washington is also concerned about personal safety of American
scientists who travel to China, as well as Beijing’s potential military
application of shared research.</p>
<p>A report by Congressional Research Service said China’s cooperation
under the agreement has not been consistent. For example, “China
reportedly withheld avian influenza strains required for U.S. vaccines
and in 2019, cut off U.S. access to coronavirus research, including
U.S.-funded work at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” said the CRS.</p>
<p>Advocates for renewing the agreement want to maintain some level of
official and unofficial contacts amid strained relationship between the
two countries.  </p>
<p>During a recent discussion hosted by the Washington-based Institute
for China-America Studies (ICAS), panelists said the STA is “important
symbolically” and gives confidence to researchers on both sides to
deepen their engagement with counterparts.</p>
<p>“In the event of the agreement’s non-renewal, the mutual confidence
that sustains and underpins collaboration is bound to suffer,” said ICAS
in its post-event summary.</p>
<p>Dean Cheng, a senior advisor to the China program at the U.S.
Institute of Peace, said the American system is far more open, so China
will typically be able to gather information regardless of whether there
is an agreement.</p>
<p>“The STA is no guarantee that American scientists will, in fact, be
able to access Chinese research, information, or scholars, whereas the
Chinese side will use the STA as a means of establishing an even greater
presence in the U.S.,” Cheng told VOA, adding the “strategic advantage”
under the deal will likely be with the PRC.</p>
<p>The STA was originally signed in 1979 by then-U.S. President Jimmy
Carter and then-PRC leader Deng Xiaoping. Under the agreement, the two
countries cooperate in fields including agriculture, energy, space,
health, environment, earth sciences and engineering, as well as
educational and scholarly exchanges.</p>
<p>U.S.-China science and technology activity increased in November 2009
with new agreements on joint projects in electric vehicles, or EVs,
renewable energy, and the creation of the U.S.-China Clean Energy
Research Center, or CERC, a 10-year research effort between the U.S.
Department of Energy and China’s Ministry of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>The agreement has been renewed approximately every five years since
its inception, with the most recent five-year extension occurring in
2018. Last August, it received a six-month extension as officials from
the two countries undertook negotiations to amend and strengthen the
terms.</p>

id="chinese-airlines-can-boost-us-flights-to-50-per-week-us-says">Chinese
Airlines Can Boost US Flights to 50 Per Week, US Says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Chinese passenger airlines will be allowed to boost
their weekly round-trip U.S. flights to 50 starting on March 31, up from
the current 35, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Monday,
returning the market to nearly one-third of pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>The approval “is a significant step forward in further normalization
of the U.S.-China market in anticipation of the Summer 2024 traffic
season,” the USDOT said.</p>
<p>More than 150 weekly round-trip passenger flights were allowed by
each side before restrictions were imposed in early 2020 due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, but until August 2023, Chinese and U.S. carriers
could each fly only 12 a week between</p>
<p>the two countries.</p>
<p>The number rose on Sept. 1 to 18 weekly roundtrips and then to 24 per
week starting Oct. 29. The USDOT approved 35 for Chinese carriers in
November.</p>
<p>Airlines for America, a group representing American Airlines , Delta
Air Lines and United Airlines, which fly a combined 31 weekly flights to
China, said it “supports the U.S. government’s approach to slowly,
gradually and reciprocally reopen the market with China. It’s imperative
the U.S. government maintains this approach.”</p>
<p>The Chinese embassy in Washington said it was “glad to see the
positive progress made on increasing direct passenger flights between
China and the U.S.” The embassy added it is working to “further
facilitate cross-border travel and promote people-to-people exchange
between the two countries.”</p>
<p>Reuters reported last June that newly approved Chinese flights to the
United States were not overflying Russia, which would have given them a
shorter flight time and fuel advantage over U.S. rivals blocked from
Russian airspace.</p>
<p>Other international air markets involving China have reopened far
more quickly, with seat capacity between China and the United Kingdom
this month exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 30%, and China-Singapore by
6%, according to aviation data</p>
<p>provider OAG.</p>
<p>The USDOT said it was engaged in a productive dialogue with China’s
aviation regulator towards the “implementation of a roadmap to provide
for a gradual, broader reopening of the U.S.-China air services market
and a phased and predictable return to the capacity entitlements”
specified under a U.S.-China agreement.</p>
<p>On a trip to China last year, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo
said she wanted to boost travel and tourism between the two
countries.</p>
<p>If China returned to 2019 U.S. tourism levels, it would add $30
billion to the U.S. economy and 50,000 U.S. jobs, Raimondo said in
August.</p>

<p>Lots of moving pieces on this Monday, with the biggest stories coming
in international affairs. The U.S. has appointed a special envoy for
Sudan, which is ten months into a civil war that has turned 8 million
people into refugees, sending 1.5 million into other countries; closed
80% of the hospitals in the area of the fighting; and prompted torture,
rape, and deliberate starvation of civilians, at least 14,600 of whom
have been killed. Tom Perriello will, the State Department said,
“coordinate the U.S. policy on Sudan and advance our efforts to end the
hostilities, secure unhindered humanitarian access, and support the
Sudanese people as they seek to fulfill their aspirations for freedom,
peace, and justice.”</p>

id="pentagon-absolves-itself-after-secrecy-surrounding-austins-hospitalization">Pentagon
Absolves Itself After Secrecy Surrounding Austin’s Hospitalization</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — An internal review blames privacy restrictions and staff
hesitancy for the Pentagon’s failure last month to quickly notify the
president and other senior leaders about Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin’s hospitalization for complications from prostate cancer
surgery.</p>
<p>The review, which was done by Austin’s subordinates, largely absolves
anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding his hospitalization,
which included several days in the intensive care unit. And it says
flatly there was “no indication of ill intent or an attempt to
obfuscate.”</p>
<p>Instead, the 30-day examination of the lapse — which angered the
White House and members of Congress — says procedures must be improved
and information shared better about when the defense secretary must
transfer decision-making authorities to the deputy.</p>
<p>Austin has been called to Capitol Hill on Thursday for a House
hearing and is expected to face sharp criticism. The Defense
Department’s inspector general is also conducting a review, which has
not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early December and went
to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for surgery on December
22. On January 1, he was taken back to Walter Reed by ambulance after
experiencing significant pain and was moved to the intensive care unit
the next day.</p>
<p>Although he transferred decision-making authorities to Deputy
Secretary Kathleen Hicks during his initial surgery and then again when
he was in intensive care, he did not tell her why and he did not inform
the White House.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials have acknowledged that public affairs and defense
aides were told on January 2 that Austin had been hospitalized but did
not make it public and did not tell the military service leaders or the
National Security Council until January 4. Only then did President Joe
Biden find out. It took four more days before the reason for his
hospitalization was disclosed.</p>
<p>Defense officials released an unclassified summary of the review on
Monday and a set of recommended changes. The review suggests there was
no established method for handling such an incident, and the fact that
his hospitalization was “unplanned” contributed to the failure to let
others know.</p>
<p>It also says Austin’s staff was limited by medical privacy laws that
prohibited doctors from providing information and they “were hesitant to
pry or share any information they did learn.” It adds that since
Austin’s condition was “in flux” they could not ensure “timely secured
communications.”</p>
<p>Major General Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, told reporters
Monday that Austin’s aides found themselves in an “unprecedented
situation.” He said that as Austin was being moved into intensive care,
his aides recognized that he would not have access to critical
communications, and they made the decision to transfer authorities to
the deputy.</p>
<p>The fact that staff and not Austin made the decision raised questions
about who was in control of the department at that moment, including
America’s nuclear arsenal. Ryder said there were “no gaps” in command
and control of the department.</p>
<p>Pressed on the lack of blame and whether anyone is being disciplined,
Ryder said, “as the secretary has said, the buck stops with him and he’s
taking responsibility for not notifying the president and the White
House sooner.”</p>
<p>He added that “dedicated public servants were doing what they thought
was the right thing.”</p>
<p>The 30-day review was finished and submitted to Austin on February 8,
but only parts of it were publicly released. The Pentagon has argued
that portions of the report are classified.</p>
<p>Austin, in a press briefing after he returned to work, told reporters
that he never told his staff to keep his surgery and hospitalization
secret from the White House, but acknowledged he should have handled it
differently and he apologized for keeping Biden and others in the dark.
He denied there was a culture of secrecy in his office, and also said
that staff members may have perceived that “they’re doing things in my
best interest.”</p>
<p>The recommended changes include better guidelines for the transfer of
authorities and better reporting requirements during those
incidents.</p>
<p>His secrecy about the hospitalizations prompted the White House to
issue new guidelines to ensure it will be informed any time a Cabinet
head transfers decision-making authorities when they are unreachable due
to medical, travel or other reasons.</p>

pre-commit with GitHub Actions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Max Halford Blog</p>
<p>This is a short post to share a GitHub Actions pattern I use to setup
Poetry and pre-commit. These two tools cover most of my Python
development needs. I use Poetry to manage dependencies and pre-commit to
run code checks and formatting. The setup is fast because it caches the
virtual environment and the .local directory. I like to use custom
actions for this type of stuff. These are base actions that can be
re-used in multiple workflows.</p>

<h2 id="pure-css-single-page-app-routing">Pure CSS single-page app
routing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-02-27, from: Lean Rada’s blog</p>
<p>
You’re probably a busy person, so here’s the CSS:
</p>
<pre><code><span>section:not(:target)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>display</span><span>:</span> none<span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>

<h2 id="explanation">
Explanation
</h2>
<p>
The
<a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target"><code>:target</code></a>
CSS selector selects the element that is targeted by the URL fragment.
</p>
<p>
Combined with <code>:not</code>, we can hide sections that are
<em>not</em> referenced by the URL fragment.
</p>
<p>
Just as JS routers use the fragment to hide/show sections in the DOM,
this “CSS router” uses the same fragment to hide/show sections in the
DOM.
</p>
<h2 id="experiment-default-section">
Experiment: Default section
</h2>
<p>
Notice that the example above doesn’t start with the Home section. The
content is blank initially. This is because on initial page load we
don’t have a URL fragment to begin with.
</p>
<p>
We need to make an exception for the Home section.
</p>
<p>
Let’s start by not hiding the <code>#home</code> section by default.
Only hide <code>#home</code> if there’s a specific <code>:target</code>
section.
</p>
<pre><code><span><span>-</span><span> section:not(:target) {
</span></span><span><span>+</span><span> section:not(#home, :target),
</span><span>+</span><span> :root:has(:target) #home {
</span></span><span><span> </span><span>   display: none;
</span><span> </span><span> }</span></span></code></pre>

<h2 id="experiment-nested-routes">
Experiment: Nested routes
</h2>
<p>
One thing that makes most client-side routers modular is the ability to
nest routes. We can do the same with CSS.
</p>
<pre><code><span><span>-</span><span> section:not(:target) {
</span></span><span><span>+</span><span> section:not(:target, :has(:target)) {
</span></span><span><span> </span><span>   display: none;
</span><span> </span><span> }</span></span></code></pre>
<p>
<strong>Demo v3: This demo is best when you
<a target="_blank" href="https://leanrada.com/notes/pure-css-spa-router/example3?ref=rss">view
it in a separate tab</a></strong>

<h2 id="parameterised-routes">
Parameterised routes?
</h2>
<p>
The ultimate feature for client-side routers is to dynamically catch
routes with parameters like for example <code>/post/:id</code>.
</p>
<p>
Since HTML is static, there’s no real way to do this with CSS. ☹
</p>
<p>
Unless… you could render all possible <code>:id</code> values in the
markup and use it like you would nested routes.
</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>section</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>post/128<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>section</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>section</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>post/129<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>section</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>section</span> <span>id</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>post/130<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>section</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;</span></code></pre>
<p>
But that’d be like putting the entire database in HTML. What if you have
two parameters in the route? It could be a combinatorial explosion. So
no, the experiments end here. 👋
