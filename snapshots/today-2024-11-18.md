<p>Last year PC case and peripheral maker Silverstone posted a picture of a retro-inspired computer chassis with a 1980s-inspired beige design, space for two 5.25 inch floppy drives, and a few modern touches like USB Type-C ports.

date: 2024-11-18, from: Michael Tsai

I really like working in Lightroom Classic except that&#8212;despite continually updating to newer versions that promise performance improvements and newer Macs with faster processors, SSDs, and more RAM&#8212;it still feels slow. Maybe it&#8217;s my imagination, but I don&#8217;t think it was always thus. I think I used to be able to import a thousand photos [&#8230;]
