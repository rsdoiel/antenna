Court opens new term with election disputes looming</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Transgender rights, the regulation of “ghost guns” and
the death penalty highlight the Supreme Court’s election-season term
that begins Monday, with the prospect of the court’s intervention in
voting disputes lurking in the background.</p>
<p>The justices are returning to the bench at a time of waning public
confidence in the court and calls to limit their terms to 18 years that
have wide support, including the backing of Democratic President Joe
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s White House
nominee.</p>
<p>Whether by design or happenstance, the justices are hearing fewer
high-profile cases than they did in recent terms that included
far-reaching decisions by the 6-3 conservative majority on presidential
immunity, abortion, guns and affirmative action.</p>
<p>The lighter schedule would allow them to easily add election cases,
if those make their way to the high court in the run-up to the Nov. 5
election between Republican Donald Trump and Harris, or its immediate
aftermath.</p>
<p>“I think there are legal issues that arise out of the political
process. And so, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that
should be necessary,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told CBS News last
month in an interview to her promote new memoir Lovely One.</p>
<p>The court’s involvement in election disputes might depend on the
closeness of the outcome and whether the justices’ intervention would
tip the outcome, David Cole, the outgoing legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said at a recent Washington event.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the court wants to get involved, but it may have to,”
Cole said.</p>
<p>The court turned away multiple challenges from Trump and his allies
to the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Biden. It’s been
nearly a quarter-century since the Supreme Court effectively decided the
2000 presidential election, in which Republican George W. Bush edged
Democrat Al Gore.</p>
<p>When the justices gather Monday morning on a date set by federal law,
they will shake hands with each other as they always do. Just after 10
o’clock, they will emerge from behind freshly cleaned heavy red drapery
and take their seats on the curved mahogany bench, Chief Justice John
Roberts in the center chair and his eight colleagues seated in order of
seniority.</p>
<p>There are likely to be smiles and shared private jokes. But the
friendliness of that moment will not sweep away tensions that have
barely been concealed.</p>
<p>During the summer, two justices, Elena Kagan and Jackson, voiced
support for toughening the new ethics code that so far lacks a means of
enforcement.</p>
<p>The leak to The New York Times of the contents of a memo Roberts
wrote last winter that outlined his approach to the court’s presidential
immunity decision “was nothing short of shocking,” Supreme Court lawyer
Lisa Blatt said last week at a Washington preview of the coming
term.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Politico obtained the draft decision overturning Roe
v. Wade, the landmark abortion case.</p>
<p>“Something does feel broken,” Blatt said. Describing her experience
arguing before the court, she said, some justices “just seem visibly
frustrated.”</p>
<p>Important cases dot the court’s calendar, beginning Tuesday. The
court will take up a challenge to a Biden administration attempt to
regulate hard-to-trace “ghost guns” that had been turning up at crime
scenes in increasing numbers. The Supreme Court jumped into the case
after the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the
regulation.</p>
<p>Last term, conservatives voted 6-3 to strike down a gun regulation
that had banned bump stocks, an accessory that allows some weapons to
fire at a rate comparable to machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the
nation’s deadliest modern mass shooting in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>A day after the guns case, the justices will take up the latest twist
in Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip’s long quest for freedom.
His case is the rare instance in which prosecutors are conceding
mistakes in the trial that led to Glossip’s conviction and death
sentence.</p>
<p>The highest-profile case on the agenda so far is a fight over
transgender rights that is focused on state bans on gender-affirming
care. It probably will be argued in December.</p>
<p>Republican-led states have enacted a variety of restrictions on
health care for transgender people, school sports participation,
bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led
states have extended protections for transgender people. The Supreme
Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new
federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.</p>
<p>The case before the high court involves a law in Tennessee that
restricts puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors.
About half the states have enacted similar restrictions.</p>
<p>Also on tap for the late fall is an appeal from the adult
entertainment industry to overturn a Texas law that requires
pornographic websites to verify the age of their users.</p>
<p>Only about half the court’s calendar for the term has been filled,
and several big cases could be added. Among those is a push by
Republican-led states and conservative legal outlets to further restrict
federal agencies.</p>
<p>The immediate target is the method the Federal Communications
Commission has used to fund telephone service for rural and low-income
people and broadband services for schools and libraries.</p>
<p>The case, which the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court,
could give the justices the opportunity to revive a legal doctrine known
as nondelegation that has not been used to strike down legislation in
nearly 90 years. Several conservative justices have expressed support
for the idea of limiting the authority Congress can delegate to federal
agencies.</p>

id="a-week-after-helene-hit-thousands-still-without-water-struggle-to-find-enough">A
week after Helene hit, thousands still without water struggle to find
enough</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — Nearly a week after Hurricane Helene
brought devastation to western North Carolina, a shiny stainless steel
tanker truck in downtown Asheville attracted residents carrying 19-liter
containers, milk jugs and buckets to fill with what has become a
desperately scare resource — drinking water.</p>
<p>Flooding tore through the city’s water system, destroying so much
infrastructure that officials said repairs could take weeks. To make do,
Anna Ramsey arrived Wednesday with her two children, who each left
carrying plastic bags filled with 7.6 liters of water.</p>
<p>“We have no water. We have no power. But I think it’s also been
humbling,” Ramsey said.</p>
<p>Helene’s path through the Southeast left a trail of power outages so
large the darkness was visible from space. Tens of trillions of liters
of rain fell and more than 200 people were killed, making Helene the
deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005.
Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, and search crews must
trudge through knee-deep debris to learn whether residents are safe.</p>
<p>It also damaged water utilities so severely and over such a wide
inland area that one federal official said the toll “could be considered
unprecedented.” As of Thursday, about 136,000 people in the Southeast
were served by a nonoperational water provider and more than 1.8 million
were living under a boil water advisory, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Western North Carolina was especially hard hit. Officials are facing
a difficult rebuilding task made harder by the steep, narrow valleys of
the Blue Ridge Mountains that during a more typical October would
attract throngs of fall tourists.</p>
<p>“The challenges of the geography are just fewer roads, fewer access
points, fewer areas of flat ground to stage resources” said Brian Smith,
acting deputy division director for the EPA’s water division in the
Southeast.</p>
<p>After days without water, people long for more than just a sponge
bath.</p>
<p>“I would love a shower,” said Sue Riles in Asheville. “Running water
would be incredible.”</p>
<p>The raging floodwaters of Helene destroyed crucial parts of
Asheville’s water system, scouring out the pipes that convey water from
a reservoir in the mountains above town that is the largest of three
water supplies for the system. To reach a second reservoir that was
knocked offline, a road had to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Boosted output from the third source restored water flow in some
southern Asheville neighborhoods Friday, but without full repairs
schools may not be able to resume in-person classes, hospitals may not
restore normal operations, and the city’s hotels and restaurants may not
fully reopen.</p>
<p>Even water that’s unfit to drink is scarce. Drew Reisinger, the
elected Buncombe County register of deeds, worries about people in
apartments who can’t easily haul a bucket of water from a creek to flush
their toilet. Officials are advising people to collect nondrinkable
water for household needs from a local swimming pool.</p>
<p>“One thing no one is talking about is the amount of poop that exists
in every toilet in Asheville,” he said. “We’re dealing with a public
health emergency.”</p>
<p>It’s a situation that becomes more dangerous the longer it lasts.
Even in communities fortunate enough to have running water, hundreds of
providers have issued boil water notices indicating the water could be
contaminated. But boiling water for cooking and drinking is time
consuming and small mistakes can cause stomach illness, according to
Natalie Exum, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health.</p>
<p>“Every day that goes by, you could be exposed to a pathogen,” Exum
said. “These basic services that we take for granted in our everyday
lives actually do do a lot to prevent illness.”</p>
<p>Travis Edwards’ faucet worked immediately after the storm. He filled
as many containers as he could for himself and his child, but it didn’t
take long for the flow to weaken, then stop. They rationed water,
switching to hand sanitizer and barely putting any on toothbrushes.</p>
<p>“(We) didn’t realize how dehydrated we were getting,” he said.</p>
<p>Federal officials have shipped millions of liters of water to areas
where people also might not be able to make phone calls or switch on the
lights.</p>
<p>Power has been restored to about 62% of homes and businesses and
8,000 crews are out working to restore power in the hardest hit parts of
North Carolina, federal officials said Thursday. In 10 counties, about
half of the cell sites are still down.</p>
<p>The first step for some utilities is simply figuring out how bad the
damage is, a job that might require EPA expertise in extreme cases.
Ruptured water pipes are a huge problem. They often run beneath roads,
many of which were crumpled and twisted by floodwaters.</p>
<p>“Pretty much anytime you see a major road damaged, there’s a very
good chance that there’s a pipe in there that’s also gotten damaged,”
said Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the
engineering firm CDM Smith.</p>
<p>Generally, repairs start at the treatment plant and move outward,
with fixes in nearby big pipes done first, according to the EPA.</p>
<p>“Over time, you’ll gradually get water to more and more people,”
White said.</p>
<p>Many people are still missing, and water repair employees don’t
typically work around search and rescue operations. It takes a toll,
according to Kevin Morley, manager of federal relations with the
American Water Works Association.</p>
<p>“There’s emotional support that is really important for all the
people involved. You’re seeing people’s lives just wiped out,” he
said.</p>
<p>Even private well owners aren’t immune. Pumps on private wells may
have lost power and overtopping floodwaters can contaminate them.</p>
<p>There’s often a “blind faith” assumption that drinking water won’t
fail. In this case, the technology was insufficient, according to Craig
Colten. Before retiring to Asheville, he was a professor in Louisiana
focused on resilience to extreme weather. He hopes Helene will prompt
politicians to spend more to ensure infrastructure withstands
destructive storms.</p>
<p>And climate change will only make the problem more severe, said Erik
Olson, a health and food expert at the nonprofit Natural Resources
Defense Council.</p>
<p>“I think states and the federal government really need to step back
and start looking at how we’re going to prepare for these extreme
weather events that are going to be occurring and recurring every single
year,” he said.</p>
<p>Edwards has developed a system to save water. He’ll soap dirty dishes
and rinse them with a trickle of water with bleach, which is caught and
transferred to a bucket — useable for the toilet.</p>
<p>Power and some cell service have returned for him. And water
distribution sites have guaranteed some measure of normalcy: Edwards
feels like he can start going out to see friends again.</p>
<p>“To not feel guilty about using more than a cup of water to, like,
wash yourself … I’m really, really grateful,” he said.</p>

spamouflage networks spread antisemitic disinformation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Spamouflage networks with connections to China are
posting antisemitic conspiracy theories on social media, casting doubt
on Washington’s independence from alleged Jewish influence and the
integrity of the two U.S. presidential candidates, a joint investigation
by VOA Mandarin and Taiwan’s Doublethink Lab, a social media analytics
firm, has found.</p>
<p>The investigation has so far uncovered more than 30 such X posts,
many of which claim or suggest that core American political
institutions, including the White House and Congress, have pledged
loyalty to or are controlled by Jewish elites and the Israeli
government.</p>
<p>One post shows a graphic of 18 U.S. officials of Jewish descent,
including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen, and the head of the Homeland Security Department, Alejandro
Mayorkas, and asks: “Jews only make up 2% of the U.S. population, so why
do they have so many representatives in important government
departments?!”</p>
<p>Another post shows a cartoon depicting Vice President Kamala Harris,
the Democratic candidate for president, and her opponent, Donald Trump,
having their tongues tangled together and wrapped around an Israeli
flagpole. The post proclaims that “no matter who of them comes to power,
they will not change their stance on Judaism.”</p>
<p>Most of the 32 posts analyzed by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab
were posted during July and August. The posts came from three
spamouflage accounts, two of which were previously reported by VOA.</p>
<p>Each of the three accounts leads its own spamouflage network. The
three networks consist of 140 accounts, which amplify content from the
three main accounts, or seeders.</p>
<p>A spamouflage network is a state-sponsored operation disguised as the
work of authentic social media users to spread pro-government narratives
and disinformation while discrediting criticism from adversaries.</p>
<p>Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab,
told VOA Mandarin that the impact of these antisemitic posts has been
limited, as most of them failed to reach real users, despite having
garnered over 160,000 views.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have cast China as one of the major threats looking to
disrupt this year’s election. Beijing, however, has repeatedly denied
these allegations and urged Washington to “not make an issue of China in
the election.”</p>
<p>Tuvia Gering, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Global
China Hub, has closely followed antisemitic disinformation coming from
China. He told VOA Mandarin that Beijing isn’t necessarily hostile
toward Jews, but anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have historically been
a handy tool to be used against Western countries.</p>
<p>“You can trace its origins back to the Cold War, when the Soviet
Union promoted antisemitic conspiracy theories all over the world just
to instigate in Western societies,” Gering said, “because it divides
them from within and it casts the West in a bad light in a strategic
competition. [It’s] the same thing you see here [with China].”</p>
<p>Anti-Semitic speech floods Chinese internet</p>
<p>Similar antisemitic narratives about U.S. politics posted by the
spamouflage accounts have long been flourishing on the Chinese
internet.</p>
<p>An article that received thousands of likes and reposts on Chinese
social media app WeChat claims that “Jewish capital” has completed its
control of the American political sphere “through infiltration,
marriages, campaign funds and lobbying.”</p>
<p>The article also brings up the Jewish heritage of many current and
former U.S. officials and their families as evidence of the alleged
Jewish takeover of America.</p>
<p>“The wife of the U.S. president is Jewish, the son-in-law of the
former U.S. president is Jewish, the mother of the previous former U.S.
president was Jewish, the U.S. Secretary of State is Jewish, the U.S.
Secretary of Treasury is Jewish, the Deputy Secretary of State, the
Attorney General … are all Jewish,” it wrote.</p>
<p>In fact, first lady Jill Biden is Roman Catholic, and the mother of
former President Barack Obama was raised as a Christian. The others
named are Jewish.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories and misinformation abounded on the Chinese
internet after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill in May
that would empower the Department of Education to adopt a new set of
standards when investigating antisemitism in educational programs.</p>
<p>Articles and videos assert that the bill marks the death of America
because it “definitively solidifies the superior and unquestionable
position of the Jews in America,” claiming falsely that anyone who’s
labeled an antisemite will be arrested.</p>
<p>One video with more than 1 million views claimed that the New
Testament of the Bible would be deemed illegal under the bill. And since
all U.S. presidents took their inaugural oath with the Bible, the bill
allegedly invalidates the legitimacy of the commander in chief. None of
that is true.</p>
<p>The Chinese public hasn’t historically been hostile toward Jews. A
2014 survey published by the Anti-Defamation League, a U.S.-based group
against antisemitism, found that only 20% of the participants from China
harbored an antisemitic attitude.</p>
<p>But when the Israel-Hamas conflict broke out a year ago, the
otherwise heavily censored Chinese social media was flooded with
antisemitic comments and praise for Nazi Germany leader Adolf
Hitler.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has dismissed criticism of antisemitism on its
internet. When asked about it at a news conference last year, Wang
Wenbin, then the spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry, said that
“China’s laws unequivocally prohibit disseminating information on
extremism, ethnic hatred, discrimination and violence via the
internet.”</p>
<p>But online hate speech against Jews has hardly disappeared. Eric Liu,
a former censor for Chinese social media Weibo who now monitors online
censorship, told VOA Mandarin that whenever Israel is in the news, there
would be a surge in online antisemitism.</p>
<p>Just last month, after dozens of members of the Lebanon-based
militant group Hezbollah were killed by explosions of their pagers,
Chinese online commentators acidly condemned Israel and Jews.</p>
<p>The attack “proves that Jews are the most terrifying and cowardly
people,” one Weibo user wrote. “They are self-centered and believe
themselves to be superior, when in fact they are considered the most
indecent and shameless. When the time comes, it’s going to be blood for
blood.”</p>

obstacles, new NATO leader aims to increase support for Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>london — With an escalating war in the Middle East, uncertainty over
Western military aid for Ukraine, and the U.S. presidential election
looming next month, new NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte has no time to
settle in.</p>
<p>The former Dutch prime minister was appointed to the role at a
ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels on Tuesday, where he told
delegates that “there can be no lasting security in Europe without a
strong, independent Ukraine,” and affirmed that “Ukraine’s rightful
place is in NATO.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Rutte was welcomed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy to Kyiv.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy wasted no time in relaying his demands.</p>
<p>“We have discussed the most urgent needs of our troops, the weapons
and the recruitment to the brigades,” Zelenskyy said at a news
conference alongside Rutte on Thursday. “We will have more time today to
discuss more details on how to strengthen Ukraine’s positions on the
front so that we can exert more pressure on Russia in order to support
just and realistic diplomacy. That is why we need sufficient quantity
and quality of weapons, including long-range weapons, the decision on
which, in my opinion, our Western partners are delaying,” he told
reporters.</p>
<p>Ukraine wants to use Western long-range missiles on targets inside
Russia. The U.S. and other allies are holding back, fearing escalation
with Moscow.</p>
<p>NATO’s new secretary-general made his position clear.</p>
<p>“Ukraine obviously has the right to defend itself and international
law is on the side of Ukraine, meaning that this right does not end at
the border. Russia is pursuing this illegal war … targeting Russian
fighter jets and missiles before they can be used against Ukraine’s
civilian infrastructure can help save lives,” Rutte told reporters.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s president was asked whether he feared the world was
forgetting about his country, amid the escalating conflict in the Middle
East.</p>
<p>“I wish that Ukraine is not forgotten,” Zelenskyy said. “And the best
way to show this is by giving particular weapons, by giving particular
permissions. And help to shoot down hostile drones — by the way, the
same Iranian rockets and drones — to shoot them down the same way as
they are shot down in the sky of Israel. Do the same over the skies of
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Rutte is a longtime ally of Ukraine, noted analyst Armida van Rij, a
senior research fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House.</p>
<p>“While he was prime minister of the Netherlands, he was very
supportive of Ukraine. He’s the one who signed off on the F-16s [fighter
jets] deal for Ukraine as well. So, there is that history of support,”
van Rij told VOA.</p>
<p>However, Rutte is facing headwinds as he tries to boost military
support for Ukraine among NATO allies.</p>
<p>Next month, U.S. voters will choose a new president: Donald Trump or
Kamala Harris. Rutte said he would work with whoever is elected — but
neither outcome will be straightforward, said van Rij.</p>
<p>“There is a real risk for Ukraine that Trump may try to force
Ukraine’s hand and force Ukraine to capitulate to Russia, which would be
terrible for European security. That’s the first challenge. But the
second challenge is even if Vice President Harris were to win the U.S.
elections, she may still face a divided Congress and she may still
struggle to pass aid packages in support for Ukraine through
Congress.”</p>
<p>Either scenario would require European NATO allies to step up their
military aid.</p>
<p>“And there again, there’s challenges because many countries have
depleted their stocks. They’ve given as much as they feel comfortable
with at this point. What I would like to see is to think through some of
the practical ways in which we can advance EU and NATO collaborations
specifically on this issue of developing a European defense industrial
base,” van Rij told VOA.</p>
<p>There are fears in Europe that a victory for Trump could upend the
United States’ relationship with NATO.</p>
<p>“Like [former NATO Secretary-General Jens] Stoltenberg, Rutte is
known as a ‘Trump whisperer.’ He is one of the few European politicians
who developed a good working relationship with Donald Trump. However, a
potential second Trump term could prove much more disruptive, with less
U.S. aid to Ukraine, more concessions to Russia and further questioning
of the value of NATO,” said Oana Lungescu, a distinguished fellow at
Britain’s Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) and a former NATO
spokesperson, in an email to VOA.</p>
<p>The Kremlin said this week that Russian President Vladimir Putin knew
Rutte well from his time as Dutch prime minister.</p>
<p>“At that time there were hopes of building good pragmatic relations,”
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in a phone call
Tuesday. “But we know what followed — the Netherlands adopted a rather
defiant attitude to fully exclude all contacts with Russia. So, we don’t
think that anything new or significant will happen with the policy of
the [NATO] alliance,” Peskov said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rutte takes the helm of NATO as it faces an increasingly
assertive China.</p>
<p>“On Ukraine, everyone’s very much on the same line. On China, there’s
still some allies saying, ‘We’re not sure we need to quite go into the
Indo-Pacific theater.’ In a scenario where U.S. resources and
capabilities are drawn elsewhere, i.e., the Indo-Pacific, Europeans have
to be able to fend for themselves — including look after Ukraine in the
current short-term scenario,” van Rij told VOA.</p>
<p>Rutte said another priority would be to strengthen NATO’s
partnerships with allies outside the alliance in an interconnected
world.</p>
<p>His primary focus must be on keeping NATO members safe, said Lungescu
of RUSI.</p>
<p>“As NATO secretary-general, Rutte must take the lead in arguing for
more defense spending across the alliance,” Lungescu said. “He should
make a strong case not just about figures and percentages, but about the
concrete capabilities that are needed to keep NATO nations safe in a
dangerous world.”</p>

<h2 id="californias-big-electrification-experiment">California’s Big
Electrification Experiment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzcyNDM3MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MzAyOTQ0Nn0.II77fQ-mPQQEoDccwEMWS0e_GPRpaJAHkEap-NEnVbY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
California just hit a critical climate milestone: On September 1,
Pacific Gas and Electric, the biggest utility in the state,
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/pge-rate-hike-electricity-gas-19742334.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>raised
natural gas rates</u></a> by close to $6 due to shrinking gas demand.
</p>
<p>
I didn’t say it was a milestone worth celebrating. But experts have long
warned that gas rates would go up as customers started to use less of
the fossil fuel. PG&amp;E is now forecasting enough of a drop in demand,
whether because homeowners are making efficiency improvements or
switching to electric appliances, that it needs to charge everyone a bit
more to keep up with the cost of maintaining its pipelines.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the rate increase went into effect, however, Governor
Gavin Newsom signed a
<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1221" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bill</u></a>
aimed at addressing this exact problem. The new law gives PG&amp;E and
other utilities permission to use money they would have spent to replace
aging, leaky pipelines to pay for the electrification of the homes
served by those pipes — as long as electrifying the homes is cheaper.
Instead of investing millions of ratepayer dollars into the gas system,
utilities can start to decommission parts of it, shrinking gas use and
fixed costs in tandem.
</p>
<p>
PG&amp;E actually already has the freedom to do this, and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/natural-gas-obligation-to-serve" target="_self"><u>has
even completed a fair number of projects</u></a>. But the utility has
had limited success, mainly because of an anti-discrimination law that
gives building owners the right to stick with natural gas. It only takes
one gas stalwart to thwart a whole neighborhood’s prospects for free
electric appliances, since in order to keep delivering gas to that one
household, the utility has to invest in the entire section of pipeline
serving the area. A 2023
<a href="https://gridworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Evaluation-Framework-for-Strategic-Gas-Decommissioning-in-Northern-California-Interim-Report-for-CEC-PIR-20-009.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a>
showed that while PG&amp;E had completed more than 100 projects, it
hadn’t been able to convince clusters of customers larger than five at a
time to convert.
</p>
<p>
The new law doesn’t fundamentally change the anti-discrimination rule,
known as a utility’s “duty to serve,” but it does relieve PG&amp;E and
others of this duty if at least two-thirds of the homeowners served by a
given section of pipeline consent to getting off gas. For now, the
legislation limits utilities to executing 30 such projects. But for
those 30, as long as two-thirds consent, the utility can now tell the
holdouts that it is retiring the pipeline, and that they have no choice
but to get on the electric bandwagon.
</p>
<p>
“If a supermajority wants it, it can move forward,” Matt Vespa, a senior
attorney from Earthjustice who worked on the legislation, told me.
“Which I think is probably a good place to start from. You want to have
a place where there’s significant buy-in.”
</p>
<p>
This strategy, sometimes called “zonal decarbonization” or “targeted
electrification,” is one that many climate groups are
<a href="https://buildingdecarb.org/resource/benefit-cost-analysis-of-targeted-electrification-and-gas-decommissioning-in-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocating
for</u></a> as a way to achieve an orderly and equitable transition off
of natural gas. The approach most states have taken so far — providing
subsidies that gently prod consumers into going electric — results in a
random pattern of adoption that can benefit some homeowners while
harming others. It also does nothing to deter gas utilities from
investing hundreds of millions of dollars in maintaining, replacing, or
building new pipelines each year — investments that are set up to be
recouped from ratepayers over the course of decades.
</p>
<p>
California isn’t the first place in the world to experiment with
targeted electrification. The Swiss city of Zurich began
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/20/1092429073/to-fight-climate-change-and-now-russia-too-zurich-turns-off-natural-gas#:~:text=Year%20by%20year%2C%20Zurich%20plans,animal%20manure%20or%20similar%20sources." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>systematically
shutting down sections of its gas system</u></a> in 2021, giving
affected users about a decade of warning and offering partial
compensation for the cost of new equipment. In Massachusetts, the
utility Eversource is piloting a unique
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/networked-geothermal-thermal-energy-community" target="_self"><u>neighborhood-scale
electrification project</u></a>. The company hooked up 32 residential
buildings and a few commercial businesses in the city of Framingham to a
new underground network of pipes that carry water rather than natural
gas, which in turn connect to geothermal heat pumps that use the water
to heat or cool the air inside. There are more than a dozen such
“thermal energy network” pilot projects in various stages in
Massachusetts, New York, Colorado, Washington, Vermont, Maryland, and
Minnesota.
</p>
<p>
But the new California program is unique in its scale and approach. For
one thing, it applies to <em><em>all</em></em> gas utilities in the
state. Beginning next summer, they will each need to submit maps to the
utility commission that identify potential pipeline replacement
projects; then, in 2026, regulators will use those maps to designate
priority areas, giving precedence to low-income communities and
households that lack heating or cooling. By July of that year, the
commission must establish the rules of the pilot program, including a
methodology for utilities to determine when electrification is more
cost-effective than pipeline replacement, and rules for how utilities
can pay for the projects and recover costs.
</p>
<p>
PG&amp;E supported the bill and worked closely with its authors on the
language. The utility declined an interview, but emailed me a statement
saying the legislation “enables cost-effective, targeted electrification
projects which will help avoid more expensive gas pipeline replacements,
reducing gas system operating costs, and support the state’s and
PG&amp;E’s decarbonization goals.”
</p>
<p>
Utilities will still be spending ratepayer money on the electrification
projects, but far less than they would have spent on pipeline
infrastructure. For the remaining gas customers, it’s still possible
rates will go up, though by <em><em>less</em></em> than they would have
otherwise. Mike Henchen, a principal in the carbon-free buildings
program at RMI, told me these pilot projects alone are not going to pull
so many customers away from the gas system that it will put upward
pressure on rates. The law caps the program at no more than 1% of a
utility’s customers.
</p>
<p>
Vespa, the Earthjustice attorney, told me he originally worked on a more
ambitious version of the bill that would have required utilities to
avoid any new investments in the gas system when electrification was a
cheaper alternative. But it was pared back and made voluntary in order
to get it through the legislature. “The hope is that we’ll get projects
off the ground, we’ll get proof-of-concept,” he said. “I think there was
a need to demonstrate some successful stories and then hopefully expand
from there.”
</p>
<p>
While these pilots make sense, economically, for a dual gas and electric
company like PG&amp;E, one big question is whether the state’s gas-only
utilities like Southern California Gas will take the initiative.
(SoCalGas did not respond to my inquiry prior to publication, but the
company did support the legislation.)
</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, even if lawmakers do expand the program to authorize
every cost-effective project, this model can’t transition the entire
state away from gas. These projects are more likely to pencil out in
places with lower housing density, where a given section of pipeline is
serving only a handful of homes. A
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IFA2hRQtd3UdHjruOLfLGNE-UYeojIpl/view" target="_blank"><u>fact
sheet</u></a> about the bill published by its lead sponsor, state
senator David Min, says that “zero emissions alternatives” to pipeline
replacement are only technically feasible and cost effective for about
5% of PG&amp;E’s territory. “Gas customers won’t be able to pay for the
decommissioning of the whole gas system, or even 50% of it,” said
Henchen.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, however, there’s lots of low-hanging fruit to pluck.
Targeted electrification of just 3% to 4% of gas customers across the
state could reduce gas utility spending by $15 billion to $26 billion
through 2045, according to an
<a href="https://www.ethree.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gas-Decommissioning-Fact-Sheet-2024-06-18.pdf" target="_blank">analysis</a>
by Energy and Environmental Economics.

<p>
“It’s a modest step,” said Vespa of the new law. “But I do think it’s
meaningful to start moving forward and developing the frameworks for
this.”

id="google-is-killing-its-one-click-app-to-run-chrome-os-in-a-vm-on-android-devices">Google
is killing its one-click app to run Chrome OS in a VM on Android
devices</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>Remember earlier this year, when Android Authority discovered Google
was experimenting with letting you run full Chrome OS on your Android
device? In case you were wondering if that particular piece of spaghetti
was sticking to the wall, I’m sorry to disappoint you it isn’t. Despite
creating the Ferrochrome launcher app, which would’ve made the whole
thing a one-click affair, Google has just removed the whole concept from
the Android code base altogether. Unfortunately, though, Google has
decided to kill its Ferrochrome launcher app. This was revealed to us by
a code change recently submitted to the AOSP Gerrit. The code change,
which hasn’t been merged yet, removes the entire Ferrochrome launcher
app from AOSP. Google’s reason for removing this app is that it doesn’t
plan to ship it or maintain its code. It seems that Google is shifting
towards using the Linux-based Debian distro instead of Chrome OS as its
testbed for AVF development. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority I’m
not really sure if people were really asking for something like this,
and to Google’s credit – for once – the company never even so much as
hinted at releasing this to the general public. Still, the idea of
carrying just your phone with you as your primary computer, and plugging
into a display and input devices as the need arises, remains something a
lot of people are fascinated with, and putting Chrome OS on your Android
phone would’ve been one way to achieve this goal. Despite decades of
attempts, it seems not even the smartest people in Silicon Valley can
crack this nut. Perhaps they should ask Gemini to solve it for them? It
doesn’t involve pizza’s, glue, or rocks, so who knows – it might
surprise them!</p>

<h2 id="how-can-we-make-freebsd-more-attractive-to-new-users">How can we
make FreeBSD more attractive to new users?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: OS News</p>
<p>For nearly 15 years, FreeBSD has been at the core of my personal
infrastructure, and my passion for it has only grown over time. As a
die-hard fan, I’ve stuck with BSD-based systems because they continue to
deliver exactly what I need—storage, networking, and security—without
missing a beat. The features I initially fell in love with, like ZFS,
jails, and pf, are still rock-solid and irreplaceable. There’s no need
to overhaul them, and in many ways, that reliability is what keeps me
hooked. My scripts from 20 years ago still work, and that’s a rare kind
of stability that few platforms can boast. It’s not just me, either—big
names like Netflix, Microsoft, and NetApp, alongside companies like
Tailscale and AMD, continue to support FreeBSD, further reinforcing my
belief in its strength and longevity (you can find the donators and
sponsors right here). Yet, while this familiarity is comforting, it’s
becoming clear that FreeBSD must evolve to keep pace with the modern
landscape of computing. ↫ gyptazy It’s good to read so many articles and
comments from long-time FreeBSD users and contributors who seem to
recognise that there’s a real opportunity for FreeBSD to become more
than ‘just’ a solid server operating system. This aligns neatly with
FreeBSD itself recognising this, too, and investing in improving the
operating system’s support for what are not considered basic laptop
features like touchpad gestures and advanced sleep states, among other
things. I’ve long held the belief that the BSDs are far closer to
attracting a wider, more general computing-focused audience than even
they themselves sometimes seem to think. There’s a real, tangible
benefit to the way BSDs are developed and structured – a base system
developed by one team – compared to the Linux world, and there’s enough
disgruntlement among especially longtime Linux users about things like
Wayland and systemd that there’s a pool of potential users to attract
that didn’t exist only a few years ago. If you’re a little unsure about
the future of Linux – give one of the BSDs a try. There’s a real chance
you’ll love it.</p>

rolling module carries a 525 kilowatt-hour lithium iron phosphate
battery pack attaches to the back of the truck; then, the trailer full
of cargo attaches to the module. The pack offers a typical truck 250
miles of electric driving. Founder Ian Rust told me that’s just enough
energy to reach the next Revoy station, where the trucker could swap
their depleted module for a fresh one. And if the battery hits zero
charge, that’s no problem because the truck reverts to its diesel
engine. It’s a little like a plug-in hybrid vehicle, if the PHEV towed
its battery pack like an Airstream and could drop it off at will.
</p>
<p>
“If you run out of battery with us, there’s basically no range anxiety,”
Rust said. “And we do it intentionally on our routes, run it down to as
close to zero as possible before we hit the next Revoy swapping station.
That way you can get the maximum value of the battery without having to
worry about range.”
</p>
<p>
To start, a trucker in a normal, everyday semi pulls up to a Revoy
station and drops their trailer. A worker attaches a fully charged Revoy
unit to the truck and trailer—all in five minutes or less, Revoy
promises. Once in place, the unit interfaces seamlessly with the truck’s
drivetrain and controls.
</p>
<p>
“It basically takes over as the cruise control on the vehicle,” he said.
“So the driver gets it up to speed, takes their foot off the gas, and
then we actually become the primary powertrain on the vehicle. You
really only have to burn diesel for the little bit that is getting onto
the highway and then getting off the highway, and you get really extreme
MPGs with that.”
</p>
<p>
The Revoy model is going through its real-world paces as we speak.
Rust’s startup has partnered with Ryder trucking, whose drivers are
powering their semis with Revoy EVs at battery-swap stops along a
stretch of Interstate 30 in Texas and Arkansas, a major highway for auto
parts and other supplies coming from Mexico. Rust hopes the next Revoy
corridor will go into Washington State, where the ample hydropower could
help supply clean energy to all those swappable batteries. Happily, he
said, Revoy can expand piecemeal like this because its approach negates
the chicken-and-egg problem of needing a whole nation of EV chargers to
make the vehicles themselves viable. Once a truck leaves a Revoy
corridor, it’s just a diesel-powered truck again.
</p>
<p>
Early data from the Ryder pilot shows that the EV unit slashed how much
diesel fuel a truck needs to make it down the designated corridor. “This
is a way we can reduce a path to reduce the emissions of our fleet
without having to buy anything — and without having to have to worry
about how much utilization we’re going to have to get,” Mike Plasencia,
group director of New Product Strategy at Ryder, told me.
</p>
<p>
Trucking represents one of the biggest opportunities for cutting the
carbon emissions of the transportation sector. It’s also one of the most
challenging. Heatmap has covered the problem of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-size" target="_self"><u>oversized</u></a>
SUV and pickup truck EVs, which need larger, more expensive batteries to
propel them. The trucking problem is that issue on steroids: A semi can
tow up to 80,000 pounds down an American highway.
</p>
<p>
There are companies building true EV semi trucks despite this tall order
— Tesla’s has been
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/686339/pepsico-tesla-semi-545-mile-range-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>road-testing</u></a>
one while hauling Pepsi around, and trucking mainstays like
<a href="https://www.peterbilt.com/trucks/electric/579EV" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Peterbilt</u></a>
are trying their hand as well. Although the EV model that works for
everyday cars — a built-in battery that requires recharging after a
couple hundred miles — can work for short-haul trucks that move freight
around a city, it is a difficult fit for long-haul trucking where a
driver must cover vast distances on a strict timetable. That’s exactly
where Revoy is trying to break in.
</p>
<p>
“We are really focused on long haul,” he told me. “The reason for that
is, it’s the bigger market. One of the big misconceptions in trucking is
that it’s dominated by short haul. It’s very much the opposite. And it’s
the bigger emission source, it’s the bigger fuel user.”
</p>
<p>
Rust has a background in robotics and devised the Revoy system as a
potential solution to both the high cost of EV semis and to the huge
chunks of time lost to fueling during long-distance driving. Another
part of the pitch is that the Revoy unit is more than a battery. By
employing the regenerative braking common in EVs, the Revoy provides a
redundancy beyond air brakes for slowing a big semi—that way, if the air
brakes fail, a trucker has a better option than the runaway truck lane.
The setup also provides power and active steering to the Revoy’s axle,
which Rust told me makes the big rig easier to maneuver.
</p>
<p>
Plasencia agrees. “The feedback from the drivers has been positive,” he
said. “You get feedback messages like, it felt like I was driving a car,
or like I wasn’t carrying anything.”
</p>
<p>
As it tries to expand to more trucking corridors across the nation,
Revoy may face an uphill battle in trying to sell truckers and trucking
companies on an entirely new way to think about electrifying their
fleets. But Rust has one ace up his sleeve: With Revoy, they get to keep
their trucks — no need to buy new ones.

adds 254,000 jobs, unemployment dips to 4.1% in still-sturdy labor
market</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — America’s employers added a surprisingly strong 254,000
jobs in September, the latest evidence that the U.S. labor market is
still solid enough to support steady hiring and a growing economy. </p>
<p>Last month’s hiring gain was far more than economists had expected,
and it was up sharply from the 159,000 jobs that were added in August.
And after rising for most of 2024, the unemployment rate dropped for a
second straight month, from 4.2% in August to 4.1% in September, the
Labor Department said Friday. </p>
<p>The latest figures suggest that many companies are still confident
enough to fill jobs despite the continued pressure of high interest
rates. Few employers are laying off workers, though many have grown more
cautious about hiring. </p>
<p>In an encouraging sign, the Labor Department also revised up its
estimate of job growth in July and August by a combined 72,000. </p>
<p>The September job gains were fairly broad-based, a healthy trend if
it continues. Restaurants and bars added 69,000 jobs. Health care
companies gained 45,000, government agencies 31,000, social assistance
employers 27,000 and construction companies 25,000. A category that
includes professional and business services added 17,000 after having
lost jobs for three straight months. </p>
<p>Average hourly raises were solid, too. They rose by a
higher-than-expected 0.4% from  </p>
<p>August, slightly less than the 0.5% gain the month before. Measured
from a year earlier, hourly wages climbed 4%, up a tick from a 3.9%
year-over-year gain in August. </p>
<p>The economy’s progress in taming inflation led the Federal Reserve
last month to cut its benchmark interest rate by a sizable half-point,
its first rate cut in more than four years, and said further cuts were
likely in the coming months. The Fed said it wanted to ease the cost of
borrowing to help bolster the job market. Considering Friday’s strong
jobs report, the Fed is now likely to reduce its key rate by more
typical quarter-point increments. </p>
<p>“The September jobs report shows a nice bump in labor demand at the
beginning of the fall,″ said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica
Bank. “The U.S. economy is growing solidly in 2024 even as inflation
slows to near the Fed’s target.” </p>
<p>The resilience of the economy has come as a relief. Economists had
expected that the Fed’s aggressive campaign to subdue inflation — it
jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 — would cause a
recession. It didn’t. The economy kept growing even in the face of
ever-higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. </p>
<p>Most economists say the Fed appears to have achieved the once
unlikely prospect of a “soft landing,” in which high interest rates help
vanquish inflation without triggering a recession. </p>
<p>The economy is weighing heavily on voters as the Nov. 5 presidential
election nears. </p>
<p>Many Americans are unimpressed by the job market’s durability and are
still frustrated by high prices, which remain on average 19% above where
they were in February 2021. That was when inflation began surging as the
economy rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from the pandemic
recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor. </p>
<p>The public’s discontent with inflation and the economy under
President Joe Biden has been a political burden for Vice President
Kamala Harris in her race for the White House against former President
Donald Trump. </p>
<p>The jobs report for October, which the government will issue four
days before Election Day, will likely be muddied by the effects of
Hurricane Helene and a strike by Boeing machinists. </p>
<p>Across the economy, though, most indicators look solid. The U.S.
economy, the world’s largest, grew at a vigorous 3% annual pace from
April through June, boosted by consumer spending and business
investment. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
points to slower but still healthy 2.5% annual growth in the just-ended
July-September quarter. </p>
<p>The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing
managers, reported that America’s services businesses grew for a third
straight month in September and at an unexpectedly fast pace. The
economy’s service sector is closely watched because it represents more
than 70% of U.S. jobs. </p>
<p>Last month, the nation’s households increased their spending at
retailers. And even with hiring having slowed, Americans are enjoying
unusual job security. Layoffs are near a record low as a percentage of
employment. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits also
remains near historically low levels. </p>
<p>Companies seem generally reluctant to let workers go even though some
are also hesitant to expand their payrolls. That unusual dynamic may
stem from many employers having been caught flat-footed and short of
staff after the economy began roaring back from the pandemic recession.
Posted job openings, too, have declined steadily, to 8 million in
August, after having peaked at 12.2 million in March 2022. </p>
<p>Workers have noticed the chillier environment for jobseekers. Far
fewer feel confident enough to leave their jobs to seek a better
position. The number of Americans who are quitting their jobs has
reached its lowest level since August 2020, when the economy was still
reeling from COVID.</p>

anticipating EV trends through 2035. Some key projections from the trade
group’s report:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
By 2030, annual EV sales will reach 7.7 million and account for 46% of
total light-duty sales.
</li>
<li>
That will soar to 12.2 million annual sales by 2035, with EVs accounting
for about 72% of total light-duty sales.
</li>
<li>
The total number of EVs on U.S. roads in 2035 will be nearly 80 million,
up from 4.5 million at the end of last year. This means that in about a
decade, roughly a quarter of all the vehicles on the road – new and old
– will be electric.
</li>
<li>
All this growth will necessitate the installation of more than 42.2
million charge points by 2035, 325,000 of which will need to be public
DC fast chargers.

$1.5 billion in investments toward four grid transmission projects. The
selected projects will “enable nearly 1,000 miles of new transmission
development and 7,100 MW of new capacity throughout Louisiana, Maine,
Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas, while creating nearly
9,000 good-paying jobs,” the DOE said in a statement. One of the
projects, called Southern Spirit, will involve installing a 320-mile
high-voltage direct current line across Texas, Louisiana, and
Mississippi that connects Texas’ ERCOT grid to the larger U.S. grid for
the first time. This “will enhance reliability and prevent outages
during extreme weather events,” the DOE said. “This is a REALLY. BIG.

id="analysts-japans-new-prime-minister-may-seek-nuclear-consulting-body-with-us">Analysts:
Japan’s new prime minister may seek nuclear consulting body with US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Japan’s new prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, who began
his term this week, may advocate for forming a nuclear body with the
United States that is similar to an arrangement between the U.S. and
South Korea aimed at planning for nuclear warfare contingencies.</p>
<p>“The U.S.-ROK [Republic of Korea, or South Korea] approach is
probably a good example of where the U.S. and Japan might go in the
future if nuclear threats keep increasing,” said James Schoff, a senior
director of the U.S.-Japan NEXT Alliance Initiative at the Sasakawa
Peace Foundation USA.</p>
<p>“It’s not about nuclear sharing or Japan building its own nuclear
forces — both politically impossible at the moment and not necessary —
but [about] the alliance taking more practical steps to be prepared for
U.S. nuclear retaliation, if it becomes necessary,” Schoff said.</p>
<p>He said creating such a body would demonstrate resolve, credibility
and readiness to any potential adversary and thus deter nuclear use in
the first place.</p>
<p>Nuclear talk body</p>
<p>The new body would resemble the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) that
South Korea and the United States established as part of the Washington
Declaration in April 2023. The Washington-Seoul nuclear body is aimed at
planning for potential nuclear contingencies caused by North Korea.</p>
<p>A U.S.-Japan nuclear consultative body would focus on nuclear threats
from China and Russia in addition to North Korea, analysts say.</p>
<p>In a joint statement issued at their Security Consultative Committee
meeting in July, Tokyo and Washington shared concerns over China’s
“rapid expansion of its nuclear weapons arsenal” and agreed to
strengthen deterrence through their ongoing Extended Deterrence
Dialogue.</p>
<p>“Ishiba is likely to continue the strategies of [his predecessor
Fumio] Kishida against China, and may in fact try to be bolder,” said
Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic
Council’s Indo-Pacific Security Initiative and an associate professor at
Tokyo International University.</p>
<p>Countering China</p>
<p>Though he is not entirely anti-China, Ishiba, a former defense
minister who analysts say tends to view foreign relations through a
security framework, is expected to be tough on China’s military
assertions.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Ishiba has spoken openly about the serious security
challenges China poses to Japan,” said Ken Weinstein, the Japan chair at
Hudson Institute.</p>
<p>“These challenges lie behind his desire for an Asian NATO and nuclear
sharing, neither of which is likely to be policy,” Weinstein continued.
“Instead, we are likely to see a change in tone towards the PRC with a
tougher line from the Kantei on Chinese provocations than we saw from
the more establishmentarian Kishida government.”</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the official name of China,
and the Kantei refers to the Japanese prime minister’s office.</p>
<p>Before Ishiba was elected, he wrote an article published in September
by the Hudson Institute, an American conservative non-profit think tank
based in Washington D.C., advocating for an Asian version of NATO that
would consider sharing U.S. nuclear weapons or introducing nuclear
weapons in the region.</p>
<p>He said if nuclear threats by China and North Korea escalate in the
region, “the U.S. extended deterrence in the region will no longer
function.”</p>
<p>Extended deterrence involves a U.S. commitment to use all military
assets, including nuclear weapons, to defend the region. Such a
commitment would deter potential adversaries from causing any
conflict.</p>
<p>But in recent years, there has been growing skepticism among U.S.
allies over its extended deterrence commitment, leading South Korea to
call for its own nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>In January 2023, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said South
Korea may have to consider developing its own nuclear weapons or ask the
U.S. to redeploy nuclear weapons in South Korea.</p>
<p>Yoon later retracted his statement after the NCG was created in April
2023, saying that South Korea will instead focus on enhancing deterrence
with the United States to deal with North Korea’s nuclear threat.</p>
<p>Asian NATO</p>
<p>Ishiba’s call for a collective security arrangement like an Asian
NATO and nuclear deployment and sharing options stems from uncertainty
in relying “solely on the security alliance with the U.S.,” said Daniel
Sneider, a lecturer in international policy focusing on Japanese foreign
policy at Stanford University.</p>
<p>Ishiba sees “the need to protect Taiwan from Chinese attempts to
forcefully reunify” the self-governed island that Beijing considers its
own territory. He also wants Japan “to be prepared for any
eventualities, including the retreat of the United States from global
leadership,” amid concerns over U.S. foreign policy after the
presidential election in November, Sneider said.</p>
<p>Before Japan’s own election this month, Ishiba, as a member of the
Japanese Liberal Democratic Party, visited Taiwan in August and told
Taiwan President Lai Ching-te that enhanced deterrence was necessary to
resist China’s aggression in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
<p>The Sasakawa Peace Foundation’s Schoff said Ishiba probably knows
that a true Asian NATO is not feasible, but “he is sending a signal to
China and Russia that their aggressive use of military forces harassing
other countries and penetrating their sovereign space is being noticed
and will push Asian countries closer together in collective defense if
they keep it up.”</p>
<p>Japan accused a Chinese spy plane of violating its airspace for the
first time in August.</p>
<p>Matthew Brummer, a professor at the National Graduate Institute for
Policy Studies in Tokyo, said instead of calling for an Asian NATO,
Japan will likely increase cooperation with NATO countries, deepening
security agreements, especially regarding joint technology sharing and
production.</p>

id="mixed-verdict-for-3-memphis-officers-convicted-in-mans-fatal-beating">Mixed
verdict for 3 Memphis officers convicted in man’s fatal beating</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEMPHIS, Tennessee — Three former Memphis police officers were
convicted Thursday in the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols, but were
acquitted of the harshest charges they faced for a death that sparked
national protests and calls for broad changes in policing.</p>
<p>Jurors deliberated for about six hours before coming back with the
mixed verdict for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith.</p>
<p>All were convicted of witness tampering related to the cover-up of
the beating, but Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges.
Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols’ civil rights causing death,
but convicted of the lesser charge of violating his civil rights causing
bodily injury. He was also convicted of a conspiracy to witness tamper
charge that the others were acquitted of.</p>
<p>The court remained silent as the verdicts were read.</p>
<p>The judge ordered all three officers to be taken into custody. He
planned to hold a hearing Monday to hear from the defense lawyers about
releasing them pending sentencing. The witness tampering charges carry
possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. The civil rights charge
against Haley carries up to 10 years in prison. They had faced up to
life in prison if convicted on the harshest charges.</p>
<p>The verdict marked a partial setback for prosecutors who were unable
to land a conviction for civil rights violations for two officers who
played an active role in the encounter. Jurors repeatedly watched
graphic clips from police video that showed the officers punch and kick
Nichols and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home, as the
29-year-old called out for his mother.</p>
<p>In a statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who
oversees the Justice Department’s civil rights division, said “Tyre
Nichols should be alive today.”</p>
<p>“We hope this prosecution provides some measure of comfort as the law
enforcement officers tied to his death have been held accountable,”
Clarke said.</p>
<p>Bean and Smith were seen on video wrestling with Nichols and holding
his arms, while also hitting him, but the jury was not convinced those
actions amounted to civil rights violations. An FBI agent said Smith
told him he punched Nichols, but defense lawyers argued Bean and Smith
were merely slapping Nichols’ hands away as they tried to put handcuffs
on him.</p>
<p>Rodney Wells, Nichols’ stepfather, told The Associated Press outside
the courtroom: “A win is a win. They’re all going to jail.”</p>
<p>Five officers were charged in Nichols’ death, but two pleaded guilty
and testified against members of their old crime suppression unit.</p>
<p>Prosecutors argued that Nichols was beaten for running from a traffic
stop, saying it was part of a common police practice referred to in
officer slang as a “street tax” or “run tax.” They said the officers
lied — to a supervisor, to medical professionals attending to Nichols
and in required written reports — about the extent of the force they
used.</p>
<p>“This has been a long journey for our family,” RowVaughn Wells,
Nichols’ mother, told reporters. “I’m actually in shock right now
because I still can’t believe all the stuff that’s going on. But we’re
happy that they all have been convicted and they have been
arrested.”</p>
<p>Smith’s lawyer declined to comment. Attorneys for Bean and Haley did
not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Nichols, who was Black, ran from the traffic stop despite being hit
with pepper spray and a Taser. The five officers, who were fired after
the beating, also are Black.</p>
<p>Some of the most emotional testimony at trial came from one of the
officers, Desmond Mills, who took a plea deal in which prosecutors call
for up to 15 years in prison. He testified in tears that he was sorry,
that he left Nichols’ young son fatherless and that he wishes he stopped
the punches. Later, he testified that he went along with a cover-up in
hopes that Nichols would survive and the whole thing would “blow
over.”</p>
<p>Nichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. His son is
now 7 years old.</p>
<p>The other officer who reached a deal with prosecutors, Emmitt Martin,
testified that Nichols was “helpless” while officers pummeled him, and
that afterward the officers understood “they weren’t going to tell on
me, and I wasn’t going to tell on them.” Under his plea agreement,
prosecutors will suggest a prison sentence of up to 40 years.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys sought to portray Martin as a principal aggressor.
Martin testified Nichols was not a threat, yet he acknowledged punching
and kicking Nichols in the head.</p>
<p>Mills’ lawyer declined to comment. Martin’s attorney did not
immediately respond to a phone message.</p>
<p>The police video shows the officers milling about and talking as
Nichols struggles with his injuries. An autopsy report shows he died
from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, and cuts
and bruises on his head and other areas.</p>
<p>With the federal criminal trial complete, other investigations and
court action still aren’t settled.</p>
<p>The five officers also have been charged with second-degree murder in
state court, where they pleaded not guilty, although Mills and Martin
are expected to change their pleas. A trial date in state court has not
been set.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a “patterns and
practices” investigation into how Memphis officers use force and conduct
arrests, and whether the department in the majority-Black city engages
in racially discriminatory policing.</p>
<p>The Justice Department also has a separate review concerning use of
force, de-escalation strategies and specialized units within Memphis
police.</p>
<p>Pastor Earle Fisher, a Memphis activist who has long called for
investigations of the city’s police, said he hopes the probes “provide
for us the remedies we so rightly deserve.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Nichols’ mother filed a $550 million lawsuit against
the city and its police chief.</p>
<p>Ben Crump and Anthony Romanucci, lawyers for Nichols’ family, said
the verdicts “bring a measure of accountability for his senseless and
tragic death.”</p>
<p>“Our fight for justice for Tyre is far from over,” the lawyers said
in a joint statement.</p>

id="grace-period-for-us-student-loan-payments-is-over.-heres-what-you-need-to-know">Grace
period for US student loan payments is over. Here’s what you need to
know</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The 12-month grace period for student loan borrowers ended
on September 30. The “on-ramp” period helped borrowers who are
struggling to make payments avoid the risk of defaulting and hurting
their credit score.</p>
<p>“The end of the on-ramp period means the beginning of the potentially
harsh consequences for student loan borrowers who are not able to make
payments,” said Persis Yu, Deputy Executive Director at the Student
Borrower Protection Center.</p>
<p>Around 43 million Americans have student loan debt, amounting to $1.5
trillion. Around eight million of those borrowers had enrolled in the
SAVE plan, the newest income-driven repayment plan that extended the
eligibility for borrowers to have affordable monthly student loan
payments. However, this plan is currently on hold due to legal
challenges.</p>
<p>With the on-ramp period and a separate program known as Fresh Start
ending and the SAVE plan on hold, student loan borrowers who are
struggling to afford their monthly payments have fewer options, added
Yu. Student loan borrowers who haven’t been able to afford their monthly
payments must consider their options to avoid going into default.</p>
<p>If you have student loans, here’s what you need to know.</p>
<p>What was the on-ramp period?</p>
<p>The Education Department implemented this grace period to ease the
borrower’s transition to make payments after a three-year payment pause
during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this year-long period, borrowers
were encouraged to keep making payments since interest continued to
accumulate.</p>
<p>“Normally, loans will default if you fall about nine months behind on
making payments, but during this on-ramp period, missed payments would
not move people towards defaulting and then being subject to forced
collections. However, if you missed payments, you still be falling
behind ultimately on repaying your loans,” said Abby Shaforth, director
of National Consumer Law Center’s Student Loan Borrower Assistance
Project.</p>
<p>Since this grace period has ended, student loan borrowers who don’t
make payments will go delinquent or, if their loans are not paid for
nine months, go into default.</p>
<p>Borrowers who cannot afford to make payments can apply for deferment
or forbearance, which pause payments, though interest continues to
accrue.</p>
<p>What happens if I don’t make my payments?</p>
<p>Borrowers who can’t or don’t pay risk delinquency and eventually
default. That can badly hurt your credit rating and make you ineligible
for additional aid and government benefits.</p>
<p>If a borrower missed one month’s payment, they will start receiving
email notifications, said Shaforth. Once the loan hasn’t been paid for
three months, loan servicers notify to the credit reporting agencies
that the loan is delinquent, affecting your credit history. Once the
borrower hasn’t paid the loan for nine months, the loan goes into
default.</p>
<p>If you’re struggling to pay, advisers first encourage you to check if
you qualify for an income-driven repayment plan, which determines your
payments by looking at your expenses. You can see whether you qualify by
visiting the Federal Student Aid website. If you’ve worked for a
government agency or a non-profit organization, you could also be
eligible for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which forgives
student debt after 10 years.</p>
<p>What happens when a loan goes into default?</p>
<p>When you fall behind on a loan by 270 days — roughly nine months —
the loan appears on your credit report as being in default.</p>
<p>Once a loan is in default, it goes into collections. This means the
government can garnish wages (without a court order) to go towards
paying back the loan, intercept tax refunds, and seize portions of
Social Security checks and other benefit payments.</p>
<p>What if I can’t pay?</p>
<p>If your budget doesn’t allow you to resume payments, it’s important
to know how to navigate the possibility of default and delinquency on a
student loan. Both can hurt your credit rating, which would make you
ineligible for additional aid.</p>
<p>If you’re in a short-term financial bind, you may qualify for
deferment or forbearance — allowing you to temporarily suspend
payment.</p>
<p>To determine whether deferment or forbearance are good options for
you, you can contact your loan servicer. One thing to note: interest
still accrues during deferment or forbearance. Both can also impact
potential loan forgiveness options. Depending on the conditions of your
deferment or forbearance, it may make sense to continue paying the
interest during the payment suspension.</p>
<p>What is an income-driven repayment plan?</p>
<p>The U.S. Education Department offers several plans for repaying
federal student loans. Under the standard plan, borrowers are charged a
fixed monthly amount that ensures all their debt will be repaid after 10
years. But if borrowers have difficulty paying that amount, they can
enroll in one of several plans that offer lower monthly payments based
on income and family size. Those are known as income-driven repayment
plans.</p>
<p>Income-driven options have been offered for years and generally cap
monthly payments at 10% of a borrower’s discretionary income. If a
borrower’s earnings are low enough, their bill is reduced to $0. And
after 20 or 25 years, any remaining debt gets erased.</p>
<p>What is the latest with the SAVE program?</p>
<p>In August, the Supreme Court kept on hold the SAVE plan, the
income-driven repayment plan that would have lowered payments for
millions of borrowers, while lawsuits make their way through lower
courts.</p>
<p>Eight million borrowers who had already enrolled in the SAVE plan
don’t have to pay their monthly student loan bills until the court case
is resolved. Debt that already had been forgiven under the plan was
unaffected.</p>
<p>The next court hearing about this case will be held on October
15.</p>
<p>What happened with the Fresh Start program?</p>
<p>The Fresh Start program, which gave benefits to borrowers who were
delinquent prior to the pandemic payment pause, also closed on September
30. During this limited program, student loan borrowers who were in
default prior to the pandemic were given the opportunity to remove their
loans from default, allowing them to enroll in income-driven payment
plans, or apply for deferment, among other benefits.</p>

<h2 id="us-dockworkers-to-suspend-strike-until-january">US dockworkers
to suspend strike until January</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-04, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>detroit — The union representing 45,000 striking U.S. dockworkers at
East and Gulf coast ports reached a deal Thursday to suspend a three-day
strike until January 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract.</p>
<p>The union, the International Longshoremen’s Association, is to resume
working immediately. The temporary end to the strike came after the
union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and
shipping companies, reached a tentative agreement on wages, the union
and ports said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>A person briefed on the agreement said the ports sweetened their wage
offer from about 50% over six years to 62%. The person didn’t want to be
identified because the agreement is tentative. Any wage increase would
have to be approved by union members as part of the ratification of a
final contract.</p>
<p>The union went on strike early Tuesday after its contract expired in
a dispute over pay and the automation of tasks at 36 ports stretching
from Maine to Texas. The strike came at the peak of the holiday shopping
season at the ports, which handle about half the cargo from ships coming
into and out of the United States.</p>
<p>The walkout raised the risk of shortages of goods on store shelves if
it lasted more than a few weeks. Most retailers, though, had stocked up
or shipped items early in anticipation of the dockworkers’ strike.</p>
<p>“With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it’s gonna
hold,” President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday night after the
agreement.</p>
<p>In a statement later, Biden applauded both sides “for acting
patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of
critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.”</p>
<p>Biden said that collective bargaining is “critical to building a
stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.”</p>
<p>The union’s membership won’t need to vote on the temporary suspension
of the strike, meaning that giant cranes should start loading and
unloading shipping containers Thursday night. Until January 15, the
workers will be covered under the old contract, which expired on
September 30.</p>
<p>The union had been demanding a 77% raise over six years, plus a
complete ban on the use of automation at the ports, which members see as
a threat to their jobs. Both sides also have been apart on the issues of
pension contributions and the distribution of royalties paid on
containers that are moved by workers.</p>
<p>Thomas Kohler, who teaches labor and employment law at Boston
College, said the agreement to halt the strike means that the two sides
are close to a final deal. </p>
<p>“I’m sure that if they weren’t going anywhere they wouldn’t have
suspended (the strike),” he said. “They’ve got wages. They’ll work out
the language on automation, and I’m sure that what this really means is
it gives the parties time to sit down and get exactly the language they
can both live with.”</p>
<p>Industry analysts have said that for every day of a port strike it
takes four to six days to recover. But they said a short strike of a few
days probably wouldn’t gum up the supply chain too badly.</p>
<p>Kohler said the surprise end to the strike may catch railroads with
cars, engines and crews out of position. But railroads are likely to
work quickly to fix that.</p>
<p>Just before the strike had begun, the Maritime Alliance said both
sides had moved off their original wage offers, a tentative sign of
progress.</p>
<p>The settlement pushes the strike and any potential shortages past the
November presidential election, eliminating a potential liability for
Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It’s also a big
plus for the Biden-Harris administration, which has billed itself as the
most union-friendly in American history. Shortages could have driven up
prices and reignited inflation.</p>
<p>Thursday’s deal came after administration officials met with
foreign-owned shipping companies before dawn on Zoom, according to a
person briefed on the day’s events who asked not to be identified
because the talks were private. The White House wanted to increase
pressure to settle, emphasizing the responsibility to reopen the ports
to help with recovery from Hurricane Helene, the person said.</p>
<p>Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su told them she could get the union to
the bargaining table to extend the contract if the carriers made a
higher wage offer. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients told the carriers they had
to make an offer by the end of the day so a manmade strike wouldn’t
worsen a natural disaster, the person said.</p>
<p>By midday the Maritime Alliance members agreed to a large increase,
bringing about the agreement, according to the person.</p>
