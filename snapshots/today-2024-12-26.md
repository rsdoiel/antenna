## AI-Generated Book Grifters Threaten The Future of Lace-Making

date: 2024-12-26, from: 404 Media Group

“Unfortunately, for newcomers who might be excited to dive into this hobby, they could get burned by the inadequate books—and frankly the thievery—of the work of our cherished lacemakers and designers."

## Cognitive load is what matters

date: 2024-12-26, updated: 2024-12-26, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive">Cognitive load is what matters</a></strong></p>
Excellent living document (the underlying repo has <a href="https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load/commits/main/">625 commits</a> since being created in May 2023) maintained by Artem Zakirullin about minimizing the cognitive load needed to understand and maintain software.</p>
<p>This all rings very true to me. I judge the quality of a piece of code by how easy it is to change, and anything that causes me to take on more cognitive load - unraveling a class hierarchy, reading though dozens of tiny methods - reduces the quality of the code by that metric.</p>
<p>Lots of accumulated snippets of wisdom in this one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mantras like "methods should be shorter than 15 lines of code" or "classes should be small" turned out to be somewhat wrong.</p>

## deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-Base

date: 2024-12-25, updated: 2024-12-25, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-Base">deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-Base</a></strong></p>
No model card or announcement yet, but this new model release from Chinese AI lab DeepSeek (an arm of Chinese hedge fund <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Flyer_(company)">High-Flyer</a>) looks very significant.</p>
<p>It's a huge model - 685B parameters, 687.9 GB on disk (<a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/git/size-of-lfs-files">TIL how to size a git-lfs repo</a>). The architecture is <a href="https://twitter.com/dysondunbar/status/1871955700949430299">a Mixture of Experts</a> with 256 experts, using 8 per token.</p>
<p>For comparison, Meta AI's largest released model is their <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/">Llama 3.1 model</a> with 405B parameters.</p>
<p>The new model is apparently available to some people via both <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/">chat.deepseek.com</a> and the DeepSeek API as part of a staged rollout.</p>
<p>Paul Gauthier got API access and <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1871919612000092632">used it</a> to update his new <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">Aider Polyglot leaderboard</a> - DeepSeek v3 preview scored 48.4%, putting it in second place behind <code>o1-2024-12-17 (high)</code> and in front of both <code>claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022</code> and <code>gemini-exp-1206</code>!</p>
<p><img alt="Aider leaderboard chart showing DeepSeek Chat V3 preview in second place" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/deepseek-v3.jpg" /></p>
<p>I never know if I can believe models or not (the first time I asked "what model are you?" it claimed to be "based on OpenAI's GPT-4 architecture"), but I just got this result using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> and the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/llm-deepseek/">llm-deepseek</a> plugin:</p>
<pre><code>llm -m deepseek-chat 'what deepseek model are you?'
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm DeepSeek-V3 created exclusively by DeepSeek. I'm an AI assistant, and I'm at your service! Feel free to ask me anything you'd like. I'll do my best to assist you.</p>

## A Cryptographically Secret Santa

date: 2024-12-25, from: Specbranch blog

<p>Twas about 4-6 weeks before Christmas, and all through the math department,
not a creature was stirring, not even a plucky young undergrad. Cryptography
professors Alice and Bob sat at the elliptically-curved conference table to plan
the department&rsquo;s secret Santa. Mallory, the department secretary, had been given
the task of organizing last year, and somehow managed to get three gifts while
leaving several people disappointed. This year&rsquo;s math department thus resolved
to do their secret Santa without a trusted party.</p>
