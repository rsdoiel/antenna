The Apple SuperBowl ad from 1984. It changed our culture. Gave us an ideal to hold tech companies to. Reminder that the generation before the Musks and Thiels had ideals that have been lost.

A SuperBowl ad from eight years ago. Watch it. I wonder if we&#39;ll see anything like this on Sunday? Makes me want to watch the game.

## Using pip to install a Large Language Model that's under 100MB

date: 2025-02-07, updated: 2025-02-07, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p>I just released <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-smollm2">llm-smollm2</a>, a new plugin for <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> that bundles a quantized copy of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct">SmolLM2-135M-Instruct</a> LLM inside of the Python package.</p>
<p>This means you can now <code>pip install</code> a full LLM!</p>

<p>If you're already using <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> you can install it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm install llm-smollm2</pre></div>
<p>Then run prompts like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>llm -m SmolLM2 <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>Are dogs real?<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>(New favourite test prompt for tiny models, courtesy of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timfduffy.com/post/3lhknvwijps2o">Tim Duffy</a>. <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/a71d83cd8c6caa49cec4a9f296c267df">Here's the result</a>).</p>
<p>If you don't have LLM yet first <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html">follow these installation instructions</a>, or <code>brew install llm</code> or <code>pipx install llm</code> or <code>uv tool install llm</code> depending on your preferred way of getting your Python tools.</p>
<p>If you have <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> setup you don't need to install anything at all! The following command will spin up an ephemeral environment, install the necessary packages and start a chat session with the model all in one go:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uvx --with llm-smollm2 llm chat -m SmolLM2</pre></div>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/smol.gif" alt="$ uvx --with llm-smollm2 llm chat -m SmolLM2
Chatting with SmolLM2
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to exit
Type '!multi' to enter multiple lines, then '!end' to finish
> tell me a long story about a dog
The story of a dog is a tale of love, loss, and the unspoken rules of the universe. It begins with a small, timid, and timid dog named Max. Max was born into a loving family, but his life was forever changed by a cruel and cruel owner. He was left to fend for himself, and he was left to fend for himself.

Max's owner, a kind and gentle soul named Elena, was a cruel and cruel one. She had no patience, no love, and she would do anything to keep Max away from her. Max was left to fend for himself, and he was left to fend for himself.

Max's owner, Elena, was determined to make Max happy. She took Max to a beautiful and beautiful place, where Max was allowed to roam freely. Max was allowed to roam freely, and Max was allowed to roam freely. [Then repeats that sentence many times]" style="max-width: 100%;" /></p>

</ul>

<h4 id="finding-a-tiny-model">Finding a tiny model</h4>
<p>The fact that the model is almost exactly 100MB is no coincidence: that's the <a href="https://pypi.org/help/#file-size-limit">default size limit</a> for a Python package that can be uploaded to the Python Package Index (PyPI).</p>
<p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/simonwillison.net/post/3lhklqd62jc2x">asked on Bluesky</a> if anyone had seen a just-about-usable GGUF model that was under 100MB, and Artisan Loaf <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/artisanloaf.bsky.social/post/3lhklumfhvs2r">pointed me</a> to <a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct">SmolLM2-135M-Instruct</a>.</p>
<p>I ended up using <a href="https://huggingface.co/QuantFactory/SmolLM2-135M-Instruct-GGUF/tree/main">this quantization</a> by <a href="https://huggingface.co/QuantFactory">QuantFactory</a> just because it was the first sub-100MB model I tried that worked.</p>
<p>Trick for finding quantized models: Hugging Face has a neat "model tree" feature in the side panel of their model pages, which includes links to relevant quantized models. I find most of my GGUFs using that feature.</p>

<h4 id="building-the-plugin">Building the plugin</h4>
<p>I first tried the model out using Python and the <a href="https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python">llama-cpp-python</a> library like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uv run --with llama-cpp-python python</pre></div>
<p>Then:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">llama_cpp</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-v">Llama</span>
<span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">pprint</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">pprint</span>
<span class="pl-s1">llm</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Llama</span>(<span class="pl-s1">model_path</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s">"SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf"</span>)
<span class="pl-s1">output</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-s1">llm</span>.<span class="pl-c1">create_chat_completion</span>(<span class="pl-s1">messages</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span>[
    {<span class="pl-s">"role"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"user"</span>, <span class="pl-s">"content"</span>: <span class="pl-s">"Hi"</span>}
])
<span class="pl-en">pprint</span>(<span class="pl-s1">output</span>)</pre>
<p>This gave me the output I was expecting:</p>
<pre>{<span class="pl-s">'choices'</span>: [{<span class="pl-s">'finish_reason'</span>: <span class="pl-s">'stop'</span>,
              <span class="pl-s">'index'</span>: <span class="pl-c1">0</span>,
              <span class="pl-s">'logprobs'</span>: <span class="pl-c1">None</span>,
              <span class="pl-s">'message'</span>: {<span class="pl-s">'content'</span>: <span class="pl-s">'Hello! How can I assist you today?'</span>,
                          <span class="pl-s">'role'</span>: <span class="pl-s">'assistant'</span>}}],
 <span class="pl-s">'created'</span>: <span class="pl-c1">1738903256</span>,
 <span class="pl-s">'id'</span>: <span class="pl-s">'chatcmpl-76ea1733-cc2f-46d4-9939-90efa2a05e7c'</span>,
 <span class="pl-s">'model'</span>: <span class="pl-s">'SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf'</span>,
 <span class="pl-s">'object'</span>: <span class="pl-s">'chat.completion'</span>,
 <span class="pl-s">'usage'</span>: {<span class="pl-s">'completion_tokens'</span>: <span class="pl-c1">9</span>, <span class="pl-s">'prompt_tokens'</span>: <span class="pl-c1">31</span>, <span class="pl-s">'total_tokens'</span>: <span class="pl-c1">40</span>}}</pre>
<p>But it also <em>spammed</em> my terminal with a huge volume of debugging output - which started like this:</p>
<pre><code>llama_model_load_from_file_impl: using device Metal (Apple M2 Max) - 49151 MiB free
llama_model_loader: loaded meta data with 33 key-value pairs and 272 tensors from SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf (version GGUF V3 (latest))
llama_model_loader: Dumping metadata keys/values. Note: KV overrides do not apply in this output.
llama_model_loader: - kv   0:                       general.architecture str              = llama
</code></pre>
<p>And then continued for more than <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/9ef7acd836b1cc40c14686eae4dca340">500 lines</a>!</p>
<p>I've had this problem with <code>llama-cpp-python</code> and <code>llama.cpp</code> in the past, and was sad to find that the documentation still doesn't have a great answer for how to avoid this.</p>
<p>So I turned to the just released <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/5/gemini-2/">Gemini 2.0 Pro (Experimental)</a>, because I know it's a strong model with a long input limit.</p>
<p>I ran the entire <code>llama-cpp-python</code> codebase through it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> /tmp
git clone https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python
<span class="pl-c1">cd</span> llama-cpp-python
files-to-prompt -e py <span class="pl-c1">.</span> -c <span class="pl-k">|</span> llm -m gemini-2.0-pro-exp-02-05 \
  <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">'</span>How can I prevent this library from logging any information at all while it is running - no stderr or anything like that<span class="pl-pds">'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>Here's <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/20476c2c6f7604df2994212cebfafef4#response">the answer I got back</a>. It recommended setting the logger to <code>logging.CRITICAL</code>, passing <code>verbose=False</code> to the constructor and, most importantly, using the following context manager to suppress all output:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">from</span> <span class="pl-s1">contextlib</span> <span class="pl-k">import</span> <span class="pl-s1">contextmanager</span>, <span class="pl-s1">redirect_stderr</span>, <span class="pl-s1">redirect_stdout</span>

<span class="pl-en">@<span class="pl-s1">contextmanager</span></span>
<span class="pl-k">def</span> <span class="pl-en">suppress_output</span>():
    <span class="pl-s">"""</span>
<span class="pl-s">    Suppresses all stdout and stderr output within the context.</span>
<span class="pl-s">    """</span>
    <span class="pl-k">with</span> <span class="pl-en">open</span>(<span class="pl-s1">os</span>.<span class="pl-c1">devnull</span>, <span class="pl-s">"w"</span>) <span class="pl-k">as</span> <span class="pl-s1">devnull</span>:
        <span class="pl-k">with</span> <span class="pl-en">redirect_stdout</span>(<span class="pl-s1">devnull</span>), <span class="pl-en">redirect_stderr</span>(<span class="pl-s1">devnull</span>):
            <span class="pl-k">yield</span></pre>
<p>This worked! It turned out most of the output came from initializing the <code>LLM</code> class, so I wrapped that like so:</p>
<pre><span class="pl-k">with</span> <span class="pl-en">suppress_output</span>():
    <span class="pl-s1">model</span> <span class="pl-c1">=</span> <span class="pl-en">Llama</span>(<span class="pl-s1">model_path</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-s1">self</span>.<span class="pl-c1">model_path</span>, <span class="pl-s1">verbose</span><span class="pl-c1">=</span><span class="pl-c1">False</span>)</pre>
<p>Proof of concept in hand I set about writing the plugin. I started with my <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-plugin">simonw/llm-plugin</a> cookiecutter template:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>uvx cookiecutter gh:simonw/llm-plugin</pre></div>
<pre><code>  [1/6] plugin_name (): smollm2
  [2/6] description (): SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1 for LLM
  [3/6] hyphenated (smollm2): 
  [4/6] underscored (smollm2): 
  [5/6] github_username (): simonw
  [6/6] author_name (): Simon Willison
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-smollm2/blob/0.1.1/llm_smollm2/__init__.py">rest of the plugin</a> was mostly borrowed from my existing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gguf/blob/0.2/llm_gguf.py">llm-gguf</a> plugin, updated based on the latest README for the <code>llama-cpp-python</code> project.</p>
<p>There's more information on building plugins in <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/tutorial-model-plugin.html">the tutorial on writing a plugin</a></p>
<h4 id="packaging-the-plugin">Packaging the plugin</h4>
<p>Once I had that working the last step was to figure out how to package it for PyPI. I'm never quite sure of the best way to bundle a binary file in a Python package, especially one that uses a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file... so I dumped a copy of my existing <code>pyproject.toml</code> file into o3-mini-high and prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modify this to bundle a SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf file inside the package. I don't want to use hatch or a manifest or anything, I just want to use setuptools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/67a59122-67c8-8006-9be4-29f8419343ad">the shared transcript</a> - it gave me exactly what I wanted. I bundled it by adding this to the end of the <code>toml</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-toml"><pre>[<span class="pl-en">tool</span>.<span class="pl-en">setuptools</span>.<span class="pl-en">package-data</span>]
<span class="pl-smi">llm_smollm2</span> = [<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>SmolLM2-135M-Instruct.Q4_1.gguf<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>]</pre></div>
<p>Then dropping that <code>.gguf</code> file into the <code>llm_smollm2/</code> directory and putting my plugin code in <code>llm_smollm2/__init__.py</code>.</p>
<p>I tested it locally by running this:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>python -m pip install build
python -m build</pre></div>
<p>I fired up a fresh virtual environment and ran <code>pip install ../path/to/llm-smollm2/dist/llm_smollm2-0.1-py3-none-any.whl</code> to confirm that the package worked as expected.</p>
<h4 id="publishing-to-pypi">Publishing to PyPI</h4>
<p>My cookiecutter template comes with <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-smollm2/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml">a GitHub Actions workflow</a> that publishes the package to PyPI when a new release is created using the GitHub web interface. Here's the relevant YAML:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-yaml"><pre>  <span class="pl-ent">deploy</span>:

<p>This runs after the <code>test</code> job has passed. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish">pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish</a> Action to publish to PyPI - I wrote more about how that works <a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/pypi/pypi-releases-from-github">in this TIL</a>.</p>
<h4 id="is-the-model-any-good-">Is the model any good?</h4>
<p>This one really isn't! It's not really surprising but it turns out 94MB really isn't enough space for a model that can do anything useful.</p>
<p>It's <em>super</em> fun to play with, and I continue to maintain that small, weak models are a great way to help build a mental model of how this technology actually works.</p>
<p>That's not to say SmolLM2 isn't a fantastic model family. I'm running the smallest, most restricted version here. <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm">SmolLM - blazingly fast and remarkably powerful</a> describes the full model family - which comes in 135M, 360M, and 1.7B sizes. The larger versions are a whole lot more capable.</p>
<p>If anyone can figure out something genuinely useful to do with the 94MB version I'd love to hear about it.</p>

## sqlite-s3vfs

date: 2025-02-07, updated: 2025-02-07, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs">sqlite-s3vfs</a></strong></p>
Neat open source project on the GitHub organisation for the UK government's Department for Business and Trade: a "Python virtual filesystem for SQLite to read from and write to S3."</p>
<p>I tried out <a href="https://github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs/blob/main/README.md#usage">their usage example</a> by running it in a Python REPL with all of the dependencies</p>
<pre><code>uv run --python 3.13 --with apsw --with sqlite-s3vfs --with boto3 python
</code></pre>
<p>It worked as advertised. When I listed my S3 bucket I found it had created two files - one called <code>demo.sqlite/0000000000</code> and another called <code>demo.sqlite/0000000001</code>, both 4096 bytes because each one represented a SQLite page.</p>
<p>The implementation is just <a href="https://github.com/uktrade/sqlite-s3vfs/blob/main/sqlite_s3vfs.py">200 lines of Python</a>, implementing a new SQLite Virtual Filesystem on top of <a href="https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/vfs.html#vfs-class">apsw.VFS</a>.</p>
<p>The README includes this warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No locking is performed, so client code <em>must</em> ensure that writes do not overlap with other writes or reads. If multiple writes happen at the same time, the database will probably become corrupt and data be lost.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Nov/26/s3-conditional-writes/">conditional writes</a> feature added to S3 back in November could be used to protect against that happening. Tricky as there are multiple files involved, but maybe it (or a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Aug/30/leader-election-with-s3-conditional-writes/">trick like this one</a>) could be used to implement some kind of exclusive lock between multiple processes?

## APSW SQLite query explainer

date: 2025-02-07, updated: 2025-02-07, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/apsw-query">APSW SQLite query explainer</a></strong></p>
Today I found out about <a href="https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/">APSW</a>'s (Another Python SQLite Wrapper, in constant development since 2004) <a href="https://rogerbinns.github.io/apsw/ext.html#apsw.ext.query_info">apsw.ext.query_info()</a> function, which takes a SQL query and returns a <em>very</em> detailed set of information about that query - all without executing it.</p>
<p>It actually solves a bunch of problems I've wanted to address in Datasette - like taking an arbitrary query and figuring out how many parameters (<code>?</code>) it takes and which tables and columns are represented in the result.</p>
<p>I tried it out in my console (<code>uv run --with apsw python</code>) and it seemed to work really well. Then I remembered that the Pyodide project includes WebAssembly builds of a number of Python C extensions and was delighted to <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/packages-in-pyodide.html">find apsw on that list</a>.</p>
<p>... so I <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/8d79d2a4e746f7c8966d2ae1fea90cb3">got Claude</a> to build me <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/apsw-query">a web interface</a> for trying out the function, using Pyodide to run a user's query in Python in their browser via WebAssembly.</p>
<p>Claude didn't quite get it in one shot - I had to feed it the URL to a more recent Pyodide and it got stuck in a bug loop which I fixed by pasting the code into a fresh session.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the tool. APSW SQLite query explainer. Query is select * from sqlite_master where tbl_name = ? and a parameter box below is set to example. Below is JSON with the query and a bunch of details about it." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/apsw-explain.jpg" />

## Datasette 1.0a17

date: 2025-02-06, updated: 2025-02-06, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/changelog.html#a17-2025-02-06">Datasette 1.0a17</a></strong></p>
New Datasette alpha, with a bunch of small changes and bug fixes accumulated over the past few months. Some (minor) highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/plugin_hooks.html#plugin-hook-register-magic-parameters">register_magic_parameters(datasette)</a> plugin hook can now register async functions. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2441">#2441</a>)</li>
<li>Breadcrumbs on database and table pages now include a consistent self-link for resetting query string parameters. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2454">#2454</a>)</li>
<li>New internal methods <code>datasette.set_actor_cookie()</code> and <code>datasette.delete_actor_cookie()</code>, <a href="https://docs.datasette.io/en/latest/authentication.html#authentication-ds-actor">described here</a>. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1690">#1690</a>)</li>
<li><code>/-/permissions</code> page now shows a list of all permissions registered by plugins. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/1943">#1943</a>)</li>
<li>If a table has a single unique text column Datasette now detects that as the foreign key label for that table. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2458">#2458</a>)</li>
<li>The <code>/-/permissions</code> page now includes options for filtering or exclude permission checks recorded against the current user. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2460">#2460</a>)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I was incentivized to push this release by <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-load/issues/9">an issue</a> I ran into in my new <a href="https://github.com/datasette/datasette-load">datasette-load</a> plugin, which resulted in this fix:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where replacing a database with a new one with the same name did not pick up the new database correctly. (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2465">#2465</a>)</li>
</ul>

## Quoting Andrej Karpathy

date: 2025-02-06, updated: 2025-02-06, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383"><p>There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.</p>
<p>I ask for the dumbest things like "decrease the padding on the sidebar by half" because I'm too lazy to find it. I "Accept All" always, I don't read the diffs anymore. When I get error messages I just copy paste them in with no comment, usually that fixes it. The code grows beyond my usual comprehension, I'd have to really read through it for a while. Sometimes the LLMs can't fix a bug so I just work around it or ask for random changes until it goes away.</p>
<p>It's not too bad for throwaway weekend projects, but still quite amusing. I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding - I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.</p></blockquote>

## Fukuoka, Japan

date: 2025-02-06, from: mrusme blog

"Fukuoka is the sixth-largest city in Japan and the capital city of Fukuoka
Prefecture, Japan. The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has
been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long
been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among
Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. Although humans occupied the area
since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period
arrived in the Fukuoka area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato
period. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great
distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo
(Tokyo), Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has
persisted to the present."

## Various Ways How I, a Gay Man, Use the Word “Mama”

date: 2025-02-06, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p><strong>&#8220;We’re OK, Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> When I’ve had great banter with the server the whole night, and she comes up to us to ask if there’s anything else we need before she brings the check.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;OK, Mama!!!&#8221;</strong><br /> Giving praise to a friend for any minor accomplishment.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama, are you OK?&#8221;</strong> <br /> When my friend is going through a tough breakup, and he wants to dye his hair platinum blond and is now obsessed with catching the Knockdown Center Killer.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;OK, Mamá&#8221;</strong> <br /> After my Venezuelan mother reminded me to text my aunt for her birthday.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama…&#8221;</strong><br /> When my friend has been at this new job for only six months, and they tell me they want to quit without a backup plan.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Oh, Mama!&#8221;</strong> <br /> Johnny Bravo.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Oh, Mama, we’re not doing that&#8221;</strong> <br /> At a party after I get cornered by my friend’s friend from Florida who wants to talk at me about the success of the DeSantis administration.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama, don’t&#8221;</strong><br /> Whenever Jeremy Allen White is going to engage in self-sabotaging behavior in any piece of film or TV he’s in.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama, please&#8221;</strong> <br /> When my boss is telling me we have to make the PowerPoint more digestible because the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of the company doesn’t understand the data.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Oh no, you don’t, Miss Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> I’m babysitting, and my niece steals the remote from her younger brother because she wants to watch one of those weird YouTube videos where someone is just opening Kinder Surprise Eggs for an hour.</p> <p><strong>[<i>Head tilted down</i>] &#8220;Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> When my friend is about to text the guy that’s been ghosting her.</p> <p><strong>[<i>Head titled up, eyes widened</i>] &#8220;Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> When I’m bored at a party, and my friend takes out a joint.</p> <p><strong>[<i>Blink, blink, blink</i>] … … … &#8220;Mama&#8221;</strong><br /> Someone has just asked me to go to their improv show at 11 p.m. on a Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Yes, Mama!&#8221;</strong> <br /> When a guy who is flirting with me but I’m not interested in romantically asks me if I want to get coffee.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Yes, Mamaaa!!!&#8221;</strong> <br /> When a guy I am flirting with responds, “Let’s do it, diva,” when I ask him to get coffee, so I pretend I wasn’t asking him out on a date.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Not the place, Mama.&#8221;</strong> <br /> Waiting in line to get bagels, and my friend has just started going into graphic detail about his sex life, and I’m sex-positive and want to celebrate anyone comfortable in their own body, but I’m hungry, and perhaps there’s an internalized homophobia that I haven’t fully examined in therapy yet, so I feel embarrassed, and while I do consider that probably nobody is listening to our conversation, I cannot fight the urge to shut it down.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Oh, it’s tough out there, Mama.&#8221;</strong> <br /> When my friend quit their job without a backup plan gets rejected from their fiftieth job application.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Mama?&#8221;</strong> <br /> Hiking with my lesbian friend, and she is much further ahead, and I am now alone in the woods.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;Go off, Mama!&#8221;</strong><br /> We got a flat tire, and I want to call <span class="caps">AAA</span>, but my lesbian friend says she can change it herself.</p> <p><strong>&#8220;That’s what you get, Mama.&#8221;</strong> <br /> When my girlfriend has an ugly bridesmaid dress that she doesn’t want to wear after I warned her that being a bridesmaid was a bad idea.</p>
