## Figuring out how ipsec transforms work in Linux

date: 2024-03-21, from: James Bottomley's blog

I&#8217;ve had a couple of reasons recently to wonder about ipsec: one was doing private overlay networks in confidential VMs and the other was trying to be more efficient than my IPv4 openVPN when I&#8217;m remote on an IPv6 capable network. Usually ipsec descriptions begin with tools like raccoon or strong/open/libreswan; however, I&#8217;m going to [&#8230;]

## US Takes On Apple in Antitrust Lawsuit

date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday sued Apple, the first major antitrust effort against the iPhone maker by the Biden administration, alleging it monopolized smartphone markets.  


Apple joins a list of major tech companies sued by U.S. regulators, including Alphabet's  Google, Meta Platforms and Amazon.com across the administrations of both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.


"Consumers should not have to pay higher prices because companies violate the antitrust laws," Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. "If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly."


The Justice Department alleges that Apple uses its market power to get more money from consumers, developers, content creators, artists, publishers, small businesses and merchants.


The civil lawsuit accuses Apple of an illegal monopoly on smartphones maintained by imposing contractual restrictions on, and withholding critical access from, developers.


Apple has already been subject to antitrust probes and orders in Europe, Japan and Korea, as well as lawsuits from corporate rivals such as Epic Games.  


One of Apple's most lucrative businesses - its App Store, which charges developers commissions of up to 30% - has already survived a lengthy legal challenge under U.S. law by Epic. While the lawsuit found that Apple did not violate antitrust laws, a federal judge ordered Apple to allow links and buttons to pay for apps without using Apple's in-app payment commission.


In Europe, Apple's App Store business model has been dismantled by a new law called the Digital Markets Act that went into effect earlier this month. Apple plans to let developers offer their own app stores - and, importantly, pay no commissions - but rivals such as Spotify and Epic argue Apple is still making it too hard to offer alternative app stores.


The rulings on Apple's App Store forced the Justice Department to look at Apple's other practices for the basis of a complaint, such as how Apple allows outside firms to access the chips and sensors in the iPhone.


Consumer hardware firms, such as smart-tracker maker Tile Inc, have long complained that Apple has restricted the ways in which they can work with the iPhone's sensors while developing competing products that have greater access.  


Apple began selling AirTags - which can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them when they are lost - several years after Tile had been selling a similar product.


Similarly, Apple has restricted access to a chip in the iPhone that allows for contactless payments. Credit cards can only be added to the iPhone by using Apple's own Apple Pay service.  


And Apple has also faced criticism over its iMessage service, which only works on Apple devices.


Apple has long argued that it restricts access to some user data and some of the iPhone's hardware by third-party developers for privacy and security reasons.

<p>On Thursday, Reddit debuted on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RDDT. The social network is valuing itself at $6.4 billion. But we wondered: Why go public now? Plus, the Congressional Budget Office says that the national debt will be smaller than previously thought, citing less government spending and more immigration. And we look at why we may end up with higher interest rates over the next few years.</p>

Hermes won’t sell the rare bags to just anyone, and it requires potential buyers to purchase thousands of dollars of other products just for the chance they’ll get access to the coveted leather totes, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday seeking class-action status.

## How do you verify that?

date: 2024-03-21, from: Dave Rupert blog

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W92bjv8fNTI?si=1ZBIYPjwoY9WuypF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Hank Green posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W92bjv8fNTI">a video about four lies he believed</a>. It’s a great video because it’s embarrassing to be wrong on the internet and here is smart person™️ Hank Green admitting he believed some bullshit. As you travel through the internet you’re constantly working against a lot of personal biases, like confirmation bias or the overconfidence bias, and it’s easy to slip up. It’s (biologically) difficult to correct your understanding as new facts invalidate what you believed true.</p>
<p>One simple question I’ve started asking a lot is: “How do you verify that?”</p>
<p>I’ve seen some compelling demos where LLMs take a jumble of text and spit out compelling artifacts like an image, <a href="https://openai.com/sora">some b-roll</a>, a spreadsheet, <a href="https://salt-nlp.github.io/Design2Code/">a website</a>, or <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/podcast">an entire daily news podcast</a>. It’s incredible… until my buzzkill brain starts asking questions. Images are easy to verify: does image look correct or does it contain phantom limbs and have five rows of teeth? Text summary or expansion, also within possibility to verify. A website? I mean… I can tell you if it’s an okay website code-wise but I’m probably an outlier here. Validating the accuracy of a larger corpus of data that got summarized, keyworded, and categorized? Oof. This is where the scales tip for me because it seems improbable. Or at least time consuming. Perhaps as time consuming as it takes to do the work yourself?</p>
<p>To be fair to the robots (<em>why would I ever say this?</em>) I think it’s worth pointing the question at myself. I’ve been thinking about my “old world” method of verifying facts and determined I have the following routine.</p>
<ol>
<li>I consume a lot</li>
<li>I experiment</li>
<li>I ask experts</li>
</ol>
<p>When I say “consume a lot”, I mean I read hundreds – sometimes thousands – of articles and watch hundreds of videos each week (cf. novelty seeking, information addiction) as well as <a href="https://daverupert.com/bookshelf/">my book habit</a>. To make that theoretical knowledge more practical, I prototype and experiment to answer questions. With a basic understanding established, I often ask experts for their perspective. For web tech, that’s lots of open questions or DMs to people I know care about a specific technology. I’ll then sometimes have those people on my podcast to prod them some more.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Like loose change and shells rattling inside a coffee can, I collect all those informational tidbits and filter them through my years of experience and <a href="https://media1.giphy.com/media/gW0cPZopjtpoA/giphy.gif">how my brain works</a>. That produces an outcome I’m generally satisfied with, informed yet potentially wrong. It’s not too different from an LLM where the outputs are only as good as their inputs.</p>
<p>My inputs are sometimes flawed. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/if-books-could-kill/id1651876897">If Books Could Kill…</a> is a podcast where the hosts do takedowns of my favorite books: self-help pop-psychology airport books. They do an incredible job at on-the-fly fact checking, reading criticisms, scrutinizing every assertion, asking “Hey wait, is that true?” on every page and have nearly ruined the entire genre for me. I assume you learn this brand of skepticism in journalism school and the trade-off is that you’ll never enjoy a book again in your life. But I need to remind myself the goal of a book isn’t to get to the last page, it’s to expand your thinking.</p>
<p>I wish I did better at this (so I don’t repeat falsehoods) but collecting factoids makes me feel smart and I like feeling smart so now they’re insulated inside a little blanket of my personal biases. Fact-checking in realtime doesn’t tickle the ol’ grey matter. It doesn’t have the same dopamine response.</p>
<p>One more story and I’ll let you go. In an effort to not be a total fucking grandpa all the time I’m trying to use AI more while keeping an open mind. It’s been… challenging. But the other day I needed a fact checked – something one of my investors mentioned during our YCombinator application process that was noodling around in my head – and a regular search didn’t return any results, so I tried a trending AI search tool that provides citations.</p>
<ul>
<li>First it told me “Yes, this was true” but cited the wrong reasons.</li>
<li>So I hit it with an “Are you sure?” and it changed its answer to “No, it’s not true” but cited a random Hacker News comment that asserted the opposite.</li>
<li>So I said “Your source says the opposite” and it KFC doubledown’d and said “No, it’s not true.”</li>
<li>So I copy-pasted the text from their own source into the prompt and it said “Yes, this was true.”</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a… complex user journey. And it happens to me a lot. I wonder if this tech falls victim to its own compelling demos. The “<a href="https://indieweb.social/@johnallsopp/112050757204780359">Time to First Demo</a>” is so short and often so profound, we fill in the possibilities with our own projections and science fiction. It’s harder to question the quality or veracity when our imaginations and our biases get wrapped up in the idea because it might mean questioning ourselves… which is not something humans are biologically engineered to do well.</p>
<p>Okay, this is the last bit I promise. There’s one line from that Hank Green video that stands out to me in this whole self-fact-checking debacle…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was fine with having the [mis]information put into my head, but when I put it into someone else’s head, I felt a little weird about it so I went to check just in case.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems like a humane approach to sharing information. Be liberal in what you accept, fact-check on the way out. I hope I can get better at that.</p>
<section class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1">
<p>Asking experts isn’t limited to tech either, if I share an area of interest with someone and they recommend an album, movie, coffee, book, or menu item; I’ll take them up on it. I’ll implicitly trust them to guide my experience. In Japan this is <em>omakase</em> and it’s transcendent. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

## Why the GOP Is Mad at the IEA

date: 2024-03-21, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Minneapolis is expecting snow tonight. Less than a month ago it was 65 degrees Fahrenheit in the Twin Cities • More than 100 people were evacuated from the small Australian town of Borroloola ahead of severe flooding • It is cloudy in Copenhagen where global climate leaders are <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6e44bb9496&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting</a> to hash out a plan for COP29.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. EPA unveils final auto emission rules</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Biden administration announced final new emissions standards for cars yesterday, significantly curtailing both the carbon dioxide and the toxic soot and chemicals that spew from the tailpipes of the nation’s light- and medium-duty vehicles. The rules tighten pollution limits gradually over six years, and are slightly watered down compared to the version released last April: While automakers will still have to achieve the same emissions standard by 2032 as what was originally proposed, they will now be able to transition more slowly, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=f8ceb16b61&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained Emily Pontecorvo and Robinson Meyer at Heatmap</a>. Administration officials argue that giving automakers, dealers, and labor unions more time in the near-term will make for a sturdier rule, and that the cumulative emissions benefits of the final standard converge with the original proposal. The EPA now estimates that EVs may make up anywhere between 30% and 56% of new light-duty sales from model years 2030 to 2032, and by 2032, the light-duty fleet on offer from automakers will emit half as much carbon as vehicles on the market in 2026.
</p><h3>2. GOP lawmakers accuse IEA of undermining energy security</h3><p>
<strong></strong>A group of senior Republican lawmakers <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=09f7de9715&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">penned a letter</a> to Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, accusing the group of “undermining energy security” and being a cheerleader for the “energy transition” (quotes theirs). The letter suggests the IEA has lost its credibility as a reliable and objective source of information on fossil fuel markets, and has focused too heavily on clean energy developments and too little on “the things that matter most to policymakers.” The letter is signed by House energy committee chair Cathy McMorris-Rodgers and Sen. John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate energy panel, among others.
</p><p>
	As <em>Axios</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5c5c2cb3e2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a>, the attack “has real-world stakes. The agency's work is constantly cited by policymakers, academics, journalists and civil society groups.” The IEA’s forecasts that oil demand could peak by 2030 have perturbed fossil fuel producers. OPEC sees growth continuing at least through 2045. Earlier this week the CEO of Saudi Aramco called a fossil fuel phase-out a “fantasy.”

<strong></strong>The names Otis and Dora have been <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8dd22acb36&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">retired</a> from the list of potential hurricane names because of their links to devastating extreme weather events. The World Meteorological Organization has six lists of names for northeast Pacific hurricanes that it uses over and over again, so it’s not uncommon for two different storms occurring years apart to have the same name. But a name is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d5003524cb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">removed</a> if a storm is “so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of sensitivity.” Hurricane Otis struck Acapulco in October last year, killing 51 people and causing $3 billion in damage. Dora played an “indirect meteorological role” in Maui’s massive wildfires, which killed more than 100 people and caused at least $4 billion in damages. Otis and Dora will be replaced with the names Otilio and Debora. Climate change is warming the oceans, resulting in <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=51e9b3b149&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">stronger</a> hurricanes.

Strong winds and dry weather made for ideal fire conditions, and the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the area in the evening. This photo, apparently taken in the Bergton area of Virgina, shows thick smoke coming from the fires:

<strong></strong>The Biden administration wants to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d69b620e4c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hold another offshore wind auction</a> in the Gulf of Mexico as it pushes ahead with its goal of installing 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by the end of the decade. Yesterday the Interior Department proposed the sale – which would be the second auction in the region – for sometime this year, though the date hasn’t been nailed down. More than 400,000 acres would be up for grabs for development, paving the way for enough wind energy to power 1.2 million homes. The first sale, held last year, resulted in just one lease, “underscoring the middling interest in building wind farms in the region, where wind gusts aren’t very powerful and electricity is already cheap from prolific oil and gas production,” as <em>E&E News</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=2b88ba71b6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>.

## Why we're lucky WordPress is here and other topics

date: 2024-03-21, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>I spent some time this week reviewing the UI of Radio UserLand, released in 2002. It was both a feed reader and a writing tool. </p>
<p>One would have thought, btw, that from that start that all subsequent blogging tools would have the same connections, even if the functionality was not all in the same product. But then came Twitter and Facebook, and they said they weren't blogs, and presumably would start a new tradition with new user expectations. And that worked. </p>
<p>So the integration opportunities were limited, something that took me 11 years to fully appreciate, and to give up on. I was in a intellectual cloud, not thinking straight. </p>
<p>Meantime, the tradition of blogging was preserved by WordPress. As a blogging tool, it supported the same connective features that Radio did. There were some it couldn't cover because Radio was a desktop app, not a web app (though it looked like a web app, you installed a piece of software on the desktop). </p>
<p>This was the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/1997/09/14/FractionalHorsepowerHTTPSe.html">Fractional Horsepower HTTP Server</a> idea realized. </p>
<p>So for example, we had <a href="http://radio.userland.com/userGuide/reference/howUpstreamingWorks">upstreaming</a>, which was a one-way Dropbox, a number of years before Dropbox existed. This meant that the link between the CMS and the server went through the file system. The product didn't live long enough to fulfill the potential of that feature. The idea was that you could use any editor you wanted to write something that was posted to the blog, you could choose to have it rendered through the site template, or uploaded as-is. The <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png">editor</a> we supplied with Radio was one of those <a href="http://scripting.com/2024/01/14/031201.html">tiny little text boxes</a>, but I hoped that better editors would emerge. I wanted to make one myself, combining the outliner in Frontier with scripting, to drop posts into the folder structure that Radio expected. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/radioEditorScreenshot.png"></center>Radio's tiny little textbox circa 2002.</div></p>
<p>Years later I tried to do it with Dropbox itself, with a product called <a href="http://fargo.io/docs/whatIsFargo.html">Fargo</a>. Dropbox was so incredibly close to the ideal user-owned storage server system, but they wouldn't go the final step, in creating a class of content that could be shared with two or more apps but not all apps. So the user didn't have enough control for it to work. </p>
<p>The idea of multiple apps working on the same data would be revolutionary. How do I know? Because that's how computers worked before the web. So to make the thing I want to do work, now, in 2024, I'm going to have to create my own storage system for the user, and I will pay for it, at least to start. </p>
<p>Hopefully at some point I'll be able to turn that over to Automattic and have them run it, or if they don't want to, maybe someone else will. But it has to be there for the web as a runtime environment to support the same diversity of software that the PC and Mac did in the generation before the web. </p>
<p>Technology does go backwards, a lot -- we lose valuable things without any thought, when we could keep them. Anyway, more on this later for sure. </p>
<p>BTW, that's why it's good to keep some old people around, we might remember the things that were lost. I'm trying to make sure the really good ideas, the keepers, get another chance. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/blogrollscreen.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">Another random morning bit -- something subtle in the blogroll you might not have noticed. It has no trouble dealing with titled or untitled posts. Blog posts typically have titles, social media posts do not. <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> is opinionated about this -- it <a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/21/rssIsOpinionatedAboutOptionalTitles.png">says</a> you should support both views. But the feed reader folk ignored that guidance. My little blogroll shows you how to do it, it's pretty simple. If it doesn't have a title use the description. Think of it this way. What if motorcycles, cars, trucks and bikes couldn't all use the same roads? What kind of way would that be to run a civilization. Same thing with feeds. </p>
<p>There's a screen shot of the blogroll to the right, with Scripting News highlighted and expanded. Some of those posts have titles and some don't. You and I as developers care about that, but we shouldn't show that difference that in the user interface. The users don't care and rightly so. It's confusing and takes their attention away from the writing. </p>
<p>Another topic. Something I noticed in WordPress's RSS feeds. If I start a post out with an empty title, it uses the post ID to form the URL for the post. That's the right thing to do imho. But then if I add a title, which can happen, it changes the URL to use the title. But URLs shouldn't change. It also changes the guid, so a feed reader will think there were two posts when there was just one. Now I don't know if they can change it at this late date, I imagine there are workarounds out there. But I noticed this the other day, and thought I should mention it. Why not just use the post ID for the guid, esp since it says the guid is not a permalink? And use it in forming the URL. I totally understand the benefit of using the title in the URL. But you can't depend on the title being there. </p>
<p>Finally, to answer the question raised by the title of this piece -- WordPress is, among other things, a perfect time capsule of open technologies from the early days of innovation on the web, and widely deployed and able to deliver all their benefits, if we widen our view of social media to be a <i>social web,</i> and simply create places where posts with and without titles are equally supported. It's that simple. Without WordPress we would have to build all that, and wait for it to deploy in numbers, to matter in the market. All we have to do now is make the connections. </p>

## US Congress Releases $1.1 Trillion Spending Package to Avert Shutdown

date: 2024-03-21, from: VOA News USA

Washington — After days of delay, U.S. congressional leaders unveiled a $1.1 trillion bipartisan spending measure for defense, homeland security and other programs early on Thursday, giving lawmakers less than two days to avert a partial government shutdown. 

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives will vote on the sprawling package on Friday, leaving the Democratic-majority Senate only hours to pass the package of six bills that covers about two-thirds of the $1.66 trillion in discretionary government spending for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. 

"These final six bills represent a bipartisan and bicameral compromise," the two top Senate negotiators - Patty Murray, a Democrat, and Susan Collins, a Republican - said in a statement. 

"They will invest in the American people, build a stronger economy, help keep our communities safe, and strengthen our national security and global leadership." 

The Congressional Budget Office warned that U.S. deficits and debt will grow considerably over the next 30 years, forecasting that the nation's $34.5 trillion national debt, which currently represents about 99% of GDP, could grow and rise to 166% of GDP by 2054. 

Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he is "hopeful" Congress can avert a shutdown if Democrats and Republicans in his chamber work together. 

The compressed schedule raised the risk of at least a brief partial shutdown after a Friday midnight deadline, unless Schumer can reach agreement with Senate Republicans to expedite the bill. 

House Speaker Mike Johnson touted what he called a series of wins for Republicans, from higher spending for U.S. defense and border security to a cutoff of U.S. funding for the main United Nations relief agency that provides humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza. 

"This FY24 appropriations legislation is a serious commitment to strengthening our national defense by moving the Pentagon toward a focus on its core mission," Johnson said in a statement released along with the text of the legislation. 

Democrats said they blocked some Republican cuts and policy measures and touted funds aimed at lowering childcare costs, supporting small businesses and fighting the flow of the opioid fentanyl. 

"We defeated outlandish cuts that would have been a gut punch for American families and our economy - and we fought off scores of extreme policies that would have restricted Americans’ fundamental freedoms, hurt consumers while giving giant corporations an unfair advantage, and turned back the clock on historic climate action," said Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. 

Two weeks ago, Congress narrowly avoided a shutdown that would have affected agricultural, transportation and environmental programs. 

The text unveiled on Thursday fills in the details of an agreement in principle between Johnson and Schumer, which Democratic President Joe Biden has pledged to sign into law. 

With a slim 219-213 House Republican majority, Johnson will have to rely on Democratic votes to get the spending bill to the Senate. 

Many House Republicans are still expected to oppose the legislation, including hardliners who want steeper spending cuts. 

Besides the departments of Homeland Security and Defense, the bill would fund agencies including the State Department and the Internal Revenue Service as it girds for its April 15 taxpayer filing deadline.

<p>As computer vision researchers, we believe that every pixel can tell a story. However, there seems to be a writer’s block settling into the field when it comes to dealing with large images. Large images are no longer rare—the cameras we carry in our pockets and those orbiting our planet snap pictures so big and detailed that they stretch our current best models and hardware to their breaking points when handling them. Generally, we face a quadratic increase in memory usage as a function of image size.</p>

<p>Today, we make one of two sub-optimal choices when handling large images: down-sampling or cropping. These two methods incur significant losses in the amount of information and context present in an image. We take another look at these approaches and introduce $x$T, a new framework to model large images end-to-end on contemporary GPUs while effectively aggregating global context with local details.</p>

<i>Architecture for the $x$T framework.</i>

<h2 id="why-bother-with-big-images-anyway">Why Bother with Big Images Anyway?</h2>
<p>Why bother handling large images anyways? Picture yourself in front of your TV, watching your favorite football team. The field is dotted with players all over with action occurring only on a small portion of the screen at a time. Would you be satisified, however, if you could only see a small region around where the ball currently was? Alternatively, would you be satisified watching the game in low resolution? Every pixel tells a story, no matter how far apart they are. This is true in all domains from your TV screen to a pathologist viewing a gigapixel slide to diagnose tiny patches of cancer. These images are treasure troves of information. If we can’t fully explore the wealth because our tools can’t handle the map, what’s the point?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/xt/football.png" width="90%" />
<br />
<i>Sports are fun when you know what's going on.</i>
</p>

<p>That’s precisely where the frustration lies today. The bigger the image, the more we need to simultaneously zoom out to see the whole picture and zoom in for the nitty-gritty details, making it a challenge to grasp both the forest and the trees simultaneously. Most current methods force a choice between losing sight of the forest or missing the trees, and neither option is great.</p>

<h2 id="how-xt-tries-to-fix-this">How $x$T Tries to Fix This</h2>
<p>Imagine trying to solve a massive jigsaw puzzle. Instead of tackling the whole thing at once, which would be overwhelming, you start with smaller sections, get a good look at each piece, and then figure out how they fit into the bigger picture. That’s basically what we do with large images with $x$T.</p>

<p>$x$T takes these gigantic images and chops them into smaller, more digestible pieces hierarchically. This isn’t just about making things smaller, though. It’s about understanding each piece in its own right and then, using some clever techniques, figuring out how these pieces connect on a larger scale. It’s like having a conversation with each part of the image, learning its story, and then sharing those stories with the other parts to get the full narrative.</p>

<h2 id="nested-tokenization">Nested Tokenization</h2>
<p>At the core of $x$T lies the concept of nested tokenization. In simple terms, tokenization in the realm of computer vision is akin to chopping up an image into pieces (tokens) that a model can digest and analyze. However, $x$T takes this a step further by introducing a hierarchy into the process—hence, <em>nested</em>.</p>

<p>Imagine you’re tasked with analyzing a detailed city map. Instead of trying to take in the entire map at once, you break it down into districts, then neighborhoods within those districts, and finally, streets within those neighborhoods. This hierarchical breakdown makes it easier to manage and understand the details of the map while keeping track of where everything fits in the larger picture. That’s the essence of nested tokenization—we split an image into regions, each which can be split into further sub-regions depending on the input size expected by a vision backbone (what we call a <em>region encoder</em>), before being patchified to be processed by that region encoder. This nested approach allows us to extract features at different scales on a local level.</p>

<h2 id="coordinating-region-and-context-encoders">Coordinating Region and Context Encoders</h2>
<p>Once an image is neatly divided into tokens, $x$T employs two types of encoders to make sense of these pieces: the region encoder and the context encoder. Each plays a distinct role in piecing together the image’s full story.</p>

<p>The region encoder is a standalone “local expert” which converts independent regions into detailed representations. However, since each region is processed in isolation, no information is shared across the image at large. The region encoder can be any state-of-the-art vision backbone. In our experiments we have utilized hierarchical vision transformers such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09883">Swin</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00989">Hiera</a> and also CNNs such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03545">ConvNeXt</a>!</p>

<p>Enter the context encoder, the big-picture guru. Its job is to take the detailed representations from the region encoders and stitch them together, ensuring that the insights from one token are considered in the context of the others. The context encoder is generally a long-sequence model. We experiment with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02860">Transformer-XL</a> (and our variant of it called <em>Hyper</em>) and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752">Mamba</a>, though you could use <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150">Longformer</a> and other new advances in this area. Even though these long-sequence models are generally made for language, we demonstrate that it is possible to use them effectively for vision tasks.</p>

<p>The magic of $x$T is in how these components—the nested tokenization, region encoders, and context encoders—come together. By first breaking down the image into manageable pieces and then systematically analyzing these pieces both in isolation and in conjunction, $x$T manages to maintain the fidelity of the original image’s details while also integrating long-distance context the overarching context <strong>while fitting massive images, end-to-end, on contemporary GPUs</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>We evaluate $x$T on challenging benchmark tasks that span well-established computer vision baselines to rigorous large image tasks. Particularly, we experiment with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06642">iNaturalist 2018</a> for fine-grained species classification, <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/f4d4a021f9051a6c18183b059117e8b5-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf">xView3-SAR</a> for context-dependent segmentation, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0312">MS-COCO</a> for detection.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://bair.berkeley.edu/static/blog/xt/model_performance_plot_mamba.png" width="90%" />
<br />
<i>Powerful vision models used with $x$T set a new frontier on downstream tasks such as fine-grained species classification.</i>
</p>

<p>Our experiments show that $x$T can achieve higher accuracy on all downstream tasks with fewer parameters while using much less memory per region than state-of-the-art baselines<sup>*</sup>. We are able to model images as large as 29,000 x 25,000 pixels large on 40GB A100s while comparable baselines run out of memory at only 2,800 x 2,800 pixels.</p>

<i>Powerful vision models used with $x$T set a new frontier on downstream tasks such as fine-grained species classification.</i>

<p><sup>*</sup><em>Depending on your choice of context model, such as Transformer-XL</em>.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-more-than-you-think">Why This Matters More Than You Think</h2>
<p>This approach isn’t just cool; it’s necessary. For scientists tracking climate change or doctors diagnosing diseases, it’s a game-changer. It means creating models which understand the full story, not just bits and pieces. In environmental monitoring, for example, being able to see both the broader changes over vast landscapes and the details of specific areas can help in understanding the bigger picture of climate impact. In healthcare, it could mean the difference between catching a disease early or not.</p>

<p>We are not claiming to have solved all the world’s problems in one go. We are hoping that with $x$T we have opened the door to what’s possible. We’re stepping into a new era where we don’t have to compromise on the clarity or breadth of our vision. $x$T is our big leap towards models that can juggle the intricacies of large-scale images without breaking a sweat.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more ground to cover. Research will evolve, and hopefully, so will our ability to process even bigger and more complex images. In fact, we are working on follow-ons to $x$T which will expand this frontier further.</p>

## Former Mississippi Deputy Sentenced to 40 Years in Torture of 2 Black Men

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

jackson, mississippi — A fourth former Mississippi sheriff's deputy was sentenced Wednesday to 40 years in federal prison for his part in the racist torture of two Black men by a group of white officers who called themselves the "Goon Squad."


Christian Dedmon, 29, did not look at the victims as he apologized and said he'd never forgive himself for the pain he caused. 


All six former officers charged in the case pleaded guilty last year, admitting that they subjected Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker to numerous acts of racist torture in January 2023 after a neighbor complained the men were staying in a home with a white woman. Prosecutors said Dedmon slapped the men with a sex toy and threatened to brutalize them with it.




U.S. District Judge Tom Lee said Wednesday that Dedmon carried out the most "shocking, brutal and cruel attacks imaginable" against Jenkins and Parker and against a white man during a traffic stop weeks earlier.


Jenkins, who still has trouble speaking because of his injuries, said in a statement read by his lawyer that Dedmon's actions were the most depraved of any of those who attacked him.


"Deputy Dedmon is the worst example of a police officer in the United States," Jenkins said. "Deputy Dedmon was the most aggressive, sickest and the most wicked."


Hours before Dedmon's sentencing, former Officer Daniel Opdyke, 28, cried profusely as he spoke before the judge announced his sentence of 17.5 years. Turning to look at the two victims, Opdyke said isolation behind bars has given him time to reflect on "how I transformed into the monster I became that night."


"The weight of my actions and the harm I've caused will haunt me every day," Opdyke told them. "I wish I could take away your suffering."


Parker rested his head in his hands and closed his eyes, then stood and left the courtroom before Opdyke finished speaking. Jenkins said he was "broken" and left "ashamed" by the cruel acts inflicted upon him.


The judge said Opdyke might not have been fully aware of what being a member of the Goon Squad entailed when Lieutenant Jeffrey Middleton asked him to join, but he did know it involved using excessive force.


"You were not a passive observer," Lee said. "You actively participated in that brutal attack."


All six former officers pleaded guilty last year of breaking into a home without a warrant and torturing the Black men with a stun gun, a sex toy and other objects.




On Tuesday, Lee gave a nearly 20-year prison sentence to Hunter Elward, 31, and a 17.5-year sentence to Middleton, 46, calling their actions "egregious and despicable." They, like Opdyke and Dedmon, worked as Rankin County sheriff's deputies during the attack.


Another former deputy, Brett McAlpin, 53, and a former Richland police officer, Joshua Hartfield, 32, are set for sentencing Thursday.


Last March, months before federal prosecutors announced charges in August, an investigation by The Associated Press linked some of the deputies to at least four violent encounters with Black men since 2019 that left two dead and another with lasting injuries. 


The former officers stuck to their cover story for months until finally admitting that they tortured Michael Corey Jenkins and Parker. Elward admitted to shoving a gun into Jenkins' mouth and firing it in a "mock execution" that went awry.


After Elward shot Jenkins in the mouth, lacerating his tongue and breaking his jaw, the officers devised a cover-up that included planting drugs and a gun. False charges stood against Jenkins and Parker for months.

## Chuwi MiniBook X (2023): a lot of laptop for very little money

date: 2024-03-20, from: OS News

What if the kind of laptop you&#8217;re looking for just isn&#8217;t available from any of the major or even minor manufacturers? You know exactly what you want out of a laptop, and while quite a few fulfill many of your requirements, the requirement that matters most just isn&#8217;t being made. It&#8217;s not a case of &#8220;too expensive&#8221; or &#8220;too cheap&#8221; &#8211; simply nobody will sell it to you. From HP, Dell, Apple, down to smaller and local OEMs, none of them can serve your particular set of needs. For me, that particular requirement, that particular need is that of the laptop with an 8&#8243; to 10&#8243; screen size. Even the most portable laptops sold by well-known brands today stop at 13&#8243;, often even 14&#8243;, with nowhere to go but up. I currently have a 13.3&#8243; laptop &#8211; an otherwise excellent XPS 13 9370 with a gorgeous 4K display &#8211; but as much as I love it, it&#8217;s just too big and heavy for me. I want something smaller, no bigger than roughly 10&#8243;. Why? Well, I use my laptop in exactly two locations: on the couch in one of our two living rooms, or in bed (okay that&#8217;s technically three locations). That&#8217;s it. I work from home on my workstation, I play games on my gaming PC, so I don&#8217;t need big performance on the road, nor do I need a big portable display to make working on the go bearable. On top of all this, I have two small kids running around the house, so a laptop that is easier to quickly close and put out of harm&#8217;s way is very welcome. And considering the most intensive workload it&#8217;ll ever have to contend with is playing YouTube video, I don&#8217;t need the latest Core i7 or Apple M3 either. Why not a tablet, then? First and foremost, I want to use a desktop operating system, not Android or iOS, since writing OSNews posts or doing a quick translation for my job are not fun experiences on mobile operating systems. On top of that, a tablet with a keyboard accessory often makes use of a kickstand and flappy keyboard, which are cumbersome to use on the couch, in bed, or on your lap. The exception here would be the iPad with a Magic Keyboard, but that&#8217;s an incredibly expensive affair and an Apple product, so obviously a no-go. Luckily, while the kind of small laptop I&#8217;m looking for is not available from one of the major OEMs, there are a small number of specialised OEMs that do focus on making small laptops. Roughly, the devices they make fall into one of three pricing categories. First, there&#8217;s the high-end &#8211; these usually start at around €800 or so and get well over €1000, and have a decent set of specs, often focused on gaming by opting for AMD APUs. A major player in this market is GPD, who&#8217;ve been offering products in this segment for years, and are actually a decently well-known brand at this point, even being featured on major YouTube channels like Linus Tech Tips. Then there&#8217;s the very low end, a market segment drowning in the exact same 7&#8243; laptop priced at €250 or so, sold under a variety of brand names, sporting the same low-end Celeron chip and rather crappy display. It&#8217;s also quite thick, made out of cheap plastic, and every review I&#8217;ve seen of these are not particularly positive. Unless you know what you&#8217;re getting into, do not buy these. They&#8217;re e-waste trash. In recent times, however, a middle segment has slowly started to take shape, coming in price points in between the low and high end, with reasonable specifications and build quality, without going overboard. This was exactly what I was looking for. Aside from price and specifications, mini-laptops also come in a variety of different input layouts. Being smaller than other laptops, some compromises will have to be made, and it&#8217;s this particular aspect that will most likely play a major role in which models appeal to you. The gaming-focused mini laptops will often come with dual joysticks and face buttons, while other models will come with a more traditional keyboard and trackpad, and the smallest laptops in this category ditch the trackpad in favour of a little sensor pad in the top-right of the keyboard, or a ThinkPad-style nipple. Having kept and eye on this market for years now, I knew exactly what I was looking for: I wanted a traditional keyboard and touchpad layout, with medium specifications, a capable display, and all-metal construction, for no more than roughly €400-500. Clearly, the time to strike was now, as the small, budget-oriented OEM Chuwi had just updated its 10&#8243; mini laptop with Intel&#8217;s latest low-power processor, the N100. The Chuwi Minibook X (2023), as it&#8217;s called, has an all-aluminium construction, and comes with quite decent specifications, and I managed to snag a new model through their eBay store for a mere €320 (I asked them for a discount down from €400 , and they gave it; I did not mention who I was or that I run OSNews). It has the aforementioned Alder Lake Intel N100 &#8211; released earlier this year, it&#8217;s an Intel 7 processor with 4 cores and 4 threads (so no hyperthreading) with a maximum turbo frequency of 3.4 Ghz, with a TDP of just 6 W. It&#8217;s not going to compare well to the various Core i3/i5/i7 processors, of course, but considering the type of device, it makes perfect sense to opt for something like the N100. Furthermore, this device is packing 12 GB of LPDDR5 RAM running at 4800 Mhz, and my model comes with a 512 GB SSD. The display is a 10.3&#8243; panel with a native resolution of 1920&#215;1200, with a refresh rate of only 50Hz (although some people managed to reach 60Hz and even 90Hz), and support for touch. Ports-wise, it has two USB-C ports (one marked as compatible with charging &#8211; I haven&#8217;t dared

## California Is Quietly Trump-Proofing Its EV Rules

date: 2024-03-20, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc5NTAwOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNjYyOTk5N30.eb9S1ytIhBhhTMlzic9aDVBhP0g9KoyJyQ2LAkI6wLU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Even as the Environmental Protection Agency was preparing to release federal <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-auto-emissions-rule" target="_blank">tailpipe emissions rules</a> that will steer more U.S. drivers into electric vehicles, California was working in the background to harden its own, more stringent emissions standards.</p><p>On Tuesday, the state announced an agreement with Stellantis, the automaking conglomerate that contains the Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, and Ram brands to comply with more restrictive tailpipe emissions rules through 2026. California also said Stellantis would go along with its electrification mandates through 2030 — regardless of whether either is struck down by federal regulators or the courts.</p><p>The agreement is part of California’s effort to preserve its ability to set emissions standards and mandate electrification even with a hostile White House and judicial branch. By trying to get enough of the industry to agree to its rules voluntarily and not join any effort that may arise to throw them out, it hopes either to preserve its rule-making ability or, in the worst case scenario, leverage the industry’s desire for predictability to keep the rules themselves intact.</p><p>David Clegern, public information officer at the California Air Resources Board, told me there was no connection between Tuesday’s agreement and today’s EPA announcement. The deal “gives Stellantis flexibility in how they meet California's existing greenhouse gas emissions vehicle requirements," he said. In exchange, the state gets an even deeper emissions cut than it would otherwise — some 10 million extra tons of foregone greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p><del></del>Stellantis also agreed “not to oppose California’s authority under the Clean Air Act for its greenhouse gas emissions and zero-emissions vehicle standards,” the California Air Resources Board said in its announcement of the agreement.</p><p>California has long had the ability to set its own emissions standards thanks to the structure of the Clean Air Act and a waiver from the EPA. California got some automakers to agree to a version of Obama-era tailpipe emissions rules in the summer of 2019 that the Trump administration had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/climate/automakers-rejecting-trump-pollution-rule-strike-a-deal-with-california.html" target="_blank">planned on scrapping</a>, after which Trump officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/climate/trump-california-emissions-waiver.html" target="_blank">revoked California’s ability to set emissions rules</a>. California finalized its agreement with the automakers the following year, then regained its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/09/climate/biden-california-tailpipe-waiver.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">authority to set emissions rules</a> in 2022.</p><p>The principle behind the Stellantis deal is similar to those earlier agreements, Clegern said. Stellantis had  been on the outside looking in on California’s deals with automakers, and late last year initiated an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/stellantis-petitions-to-void-california-auto-emissions-agreement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">administrative process</a> to try to get them thrown out. (It was unsuccessful.) Now, the company has agreed not only to implement emissions and electrification rules, but also to invest in electrification in the state by spending $4 million on charging infrastructure in California and $6 million in states that also adopt California’s emissions rules.</p><p>Meanwhile, the EPA is working on a new waiver process for California’s electrification standards, which would need to be completed before the end of this year to both avoid interference from a potential incoming Republican administration and to make sure it applies on the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2024/01/advocates-across-country-urge-epa-issue-clean-air-act-waiver-life-saving" target="_blank">schedule the state has set out</a>, Kathy Harris, clean vehicles director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. The rules, known as the Advanced Clean Car Standard II regulations, start with the <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-cars-program/advanced-clean-cars-ii" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2026 model year and apply through 2035</a> and mandate that all new car sales in the state be electric by the middle of the 2030s.</p><p>About a dozen other states so far have adopted the ACC II standards, including Massachusetts, New York, and Oregon<strong>.</strong> <strong><em></em></strong></p><p>Many commenters on the EPA car emission proposal set out the California rules as a model for what the agency should do. “Vehicle manufacturers also commented that they had extensive collaboration with the California Air Resources Board (CARB) during the development of CARB’s recently finalized Advanced Clean Car II (ACC II) standards,” according to the final rule, “and industry broadly recommended that EPA adopt the ACC II program in lieu of our proposed standards.”</p><p>In the end, the EPA rules follow a different model than the California standards, Harris said. Crucially, the EPA isn’t mandating electrification. In remarks at a White House even on Wednesday, EPA administrator Michael Regan emphasized that they were instead technology neutral and performance based, meaning that they <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/epa-issues-new-rules-aimed-cutting-carbon-emissions-108313335" target="_blank">leave it up to the automakers</a> to figure out how to comply.</p><p>David Reichmuth, the senior engineer in the Union of Concerned Scientists’ clean transportation program, told me that, compared to California's, the EPA rules “are distinct in what they regulate and how they regulate vehicles,” he told me. Nevertheless, “they are pulling in the same direction in trying to reduce emissions from transportation and air pollution from vehicles.”</p><p>California’s ability to set its own emissions rules is not just likely to be questioned by a Republican administration should Donald Trump win in 2025, it also could be at risk in the courts. Ohio and other states with Republican attorneys general <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/auto-week-at-d-c-circuit-raises-major-questions-for-epa/" target="_blank">sued the EPA</a> in 2022 over the existence of the California waiver in a case that was heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals last fall. The ruling is still pending.<strong></strong></p>

## GNOME 46 released

date: 2024-03-20, from: OS News

GNOME&#160;46 has been released, and its packs a ton of new features and improvements. One of the headline improvements is the new global search feature. Files comes with a new global search feature in GNOME 46. The feature is simple: activate it by clicking the new search button, or by using the Ctrl+Shift+F shortcut, then enter your query to search all your configured search locations. Global search is a great way to jump directly into search, without having to think about where the items you want are located. The new feature also leverages GNOME’s existing file search capabilities, including the ability to search the contents of files, and filter by file type and modification date. ↫ GNOME 46 release notes GNOME 46 also brings experimental support for variable refresh rate in Mutter, GNOME&#8217;s window manager, the Files application has seen a lot of work to drastically improve performance, the Settings application has been reworked, OneDrive support has been added to online accounts, and much more. Remote login has also been greatly improved. GNOME’s remote desktop experience has been significantly enhanced for version 46, with the introduction of a new dedicated remote login option. This allows remotely connecting to a GNOME system which is not already in use. Connecting in this way means that the system’s display can be configured from the remote side, resulting in a better experience for the remote user. GNOME 46 will make it to your distribution of choice over the coming weeks and months.

<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for anyone else but I can tell you why I did it.</p> <p>I was broke, I know PCs and Macs and Mac OS X &ndash; I ran OS X 10.0, 10.1 and 10.2 on a PowerMac 7600 using <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/10291-xpostfacto" rel="ugc">XPostFacto</a>.</p> <p>I got the carcase of a Core 2 Extreme PC on my local Freecycle group in 2012.</p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/lproven/status/257060672825851904" rel="ugc">https://twitter.com/lproven/status/257060672825851904</a></p> <p>RAM, no hard disks, no graphics, but case/mobo/CPU/PSU etc.</p> <p>I took the nVidia card and hard disks from my old Athlon XP. I got  the machine running, and thought it was worth a try since it was mostly  Intel: Intel chipset, Intel CPU, etc.</p> <p>I joined some fora, did some reading, used Clover and some tools from <a href="https://www.tonymacx86.com/" rel="ugc">TonyMacX86</a> and so on.</p> <p>After two days&rsquo; work it booted. I got no sound from my SoundBlaster  card, so I pulled it, turned the motherboard sound back on, and  reinstalled.</p> <p>It was a learning experience but it worked very well. I ran Snow  Leopard on it, as it was old enough to get no new updates that would  break my Hack, but new enough that all the modern browsers and things  worked fine. (2012 was the year Mountain Lion came out, so I was 2  versions behind, which suited me fine &ndash; and it ran PowerPC apps, and I  preferred the UI of the PowerPC version of MS Word, my only non-freeware  app.)</p> <p>I had 4 CPU cores, it was maxed out with 8GB RAM, and it was nice and  quick. As it was a desktop, I disabled all support for sleep and  hibernation: I turn my desktops off at night to save power. It drove a  matched pair of 21&rdquo; CRT monitors perfectly smoothly. I had an Apple  Extended keyboard on an ADB-to-USB convertor since my PS/2 ports weren&rsquo;t  supported.</p> <p>It wasn&rsquo;t totally reliable &ndash; occasionally it failed to boot, but a  power cycle usually brought it back. It was fast and pretty stable, it  ran all the OS X FOSS apps I usually used, it was much quicker than my  various elderly PowerMacs and the hardware cost was essentially &pound;0.</p> <p>It was more pleasant to use than Linux &ndash; my other machines back then  ran the still-somewhat-new Ubuntu, using GNOME 2 because Unity hadn&rsquo;t  gone mainstream yet.</p> <p>Summary: why not? It worked, it gave me a very nice and perfectly  usable desktop PC for next to no cost except some time, it was quite  educational, and the machine served me well for years. I still have it  in a basement. Sadly its main HDD is not readable any more.</p> <p>It was fun, interesting, and the end result was very usable. At that  time there was no way I could have afforded to buy an Intel Mac, but a  few years, one emigration and 2 new jobs later, I did so: a 2011 i5 Mac  mini which is now my TV-streaming box, but which I used as my main  machine until 2017 when I bought a 27&rdquo; Retina iMac from a friend.</p> <p>Cost, curiosity, learning. All good reasons in my book.</p> <p>This year I Hacked an old Dell Latitude E7270, a Core i7 machine  maxed out with 16GB RAM &ndash; with Big Sur because its Intel GPU isn&rsquo;t  supported in the Monterey I tried at first. It works, but its wifi  doesn&rsquo;t, and I needed to buy a USB wifi dongle. But performance wasn&rsquo;t  great, it took an age to boot with a lot of scary text going past, and  it didn&rsquo;t feel like a smooth machine. So, I pulled its SSD and put a  smaller one in, put ChromeOS Flex on it, and it&rsquo;s now my wife&rsquo;s main  computer. Fast, simple, totally reliable, and now I have spare Wifi  dongle. :-/ I may try on one of my old Thinkpads next.</p> <p>It is <em>much</em> easier to Hackintosh a PC today than it was 10-12  years ago, but Apple is making the experience less rewarding, as is  their right. They are a hardware company.<br /><br />(Repurposed from a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/nqi3lw/hackintosh_is_almost_dead#c_hxghiv">Lobsters comment</a>.)</p><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=90591" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## Biden Administration Unveils Strict Auto Standards to Speed Electric Shift

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

New York — President Joe Biden's administration announced Wednesday revised pollution standards for cars and trucks meant to accelerate the U.S. auto industry's shift to electric to mitigate climate change.


The rules set ambitious emission reductions for 2032 but are moderated somewhat compared with preliminary standards unveiled last April. Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years.


Those shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other leading NGOs focused on climate change.


The final rules — which were described by administration official as "the strongest ever" and would likely be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November — still require a nearly 50% drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.


The rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in the 2024 presidential election.


Trump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.


Biden argues that U.S. auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.


"I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers," said Biden in a statement. "Together, we've made historic progress."


Alluding to his target set three years ago that 50% of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted "we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead."


EVs accounted for 7.6% in 2023 sales, up from 5.9% in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.


The original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67% of new vehicle sales by 2032.


Carmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.


Following input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow manufacturers a "variety of pathways" to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.


This path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a rise in demand of late.


Biden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.


Moderating the targets in these first three years "was the right call," said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.


"These adjusted EV targets — still a stretch goal — should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up," said Bozzella, adding that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come on-line.


The final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.


Wednesday's initiative won praise from leading environmental groups including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules "take us in the right direction," according to a statement from the Natural Resources Defense Council chief Manish Bapna.


But Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as "significantly weaker."


"The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through," Becker said.


"The weaker rule means cars and pickups spew more pollution, oil companies keep socking consumers at the pump, and automakers keep wielding well-practiced delay tactics."

## Trusting content on the KDE Store

date: 2024-03-20, from: OS News

A global theme on the KDE third party store had an issue where it executed a script that removed user&#8217;s data. It wasn&#8217;t intended as malicious, but a mistake in some shell parsing. It was promptly identified and removed, but not before doing some damage to that user. This has started a lot of discourse around the concept of the store, security and upstream KDE. With the main question how can a theme have access to do this? ↫ David Edmundson That &#8216;some damage&#8217; was personal data loss, which is quite something to happen after installing a theme. KDE kind of shot itself in the foot here by having something called &#8216;global themes&#8217;, which is a combination of themes for various elements of the desktop, like the application style, icon theme, cursor theme, colour scheme, and so on, but also things like panel layout and even widgets, applets, and other things that can run code. Some of these global themes use shell scripts to implement the more advanced aspects of their themes, and all these things combined means that global themes installed through KDE&#8217;s own built-in theme installer can cause some serious damage. The problem is getting some attention now, and I hope they can find a way to make this process more transparent for end users, so people know what they&#8217;re getting themselves into. I&#8217;m not advocating for dumbing all this stuff down &#8211; this isn&#8217;t iOS or whatever &#8211; but better communication, perhaps clearer labels and warnings are definitely needed.

## Volunteers Get Window to US Chinese Exclusion Act Era

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

Seattle — The National Archives at Seattle keeps 50,000 records from the Chinese Exclusion Act era that banned Chinese laborers from immigrating to the United States. Volunteers working on the documents find stories of resilience and some find details of their family’s past.



A group of volunteers has been gathering each week at the Seattle archives to index thousands of documents from the Chinese Exclusion Act years. Volunteers say they never know what kind of drama the files will reveal. It may be an intrusive questioning of a woman about her pregnancy, or a letter from a husband to the detention center authorities, asking to transfer money to his wife.


“No, they're not happy, but at least the story is there,” said genealogist and historian Trish Hackett Nicola. She has been volunteering with the National Archives project for more than 20 years, sharing some of the stories on the project’s blog.


The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 suspended the immigration of Chinese laborers to the United States and prevented those already in the country from becoming naturalized citizens. It was repealed in 1943. The National Archives at Seattle holds more than 50,000 files spanning over 60 years, documenting Chinese people entering or leaving the country.




“Immigration did interrogations, which obviously changed over the course of the exclusion period,” said Valerie Szwaya, director of archival operations at the National Archives at Seattle. “And they got substantially more detailed as the time period for exclusion went on.”


Volunteer Rhonda Farrar was motivated to join the project to resolve mysteries in her own family’s past. As she works with the files, she discovers that sometimes the questions are intrusive, she said, and sometimes they are mundane.


“They’ll ask you how many mirrors you have in the house back home in China, where you sleep, and where do you keep your rice,” Farrar said.


Sometimes, they are about family.


Farrar’s father, Edwin Law, died when she was a teenager. She found a file on him as she was working on a file from the last years of the Act. The file misspelled his name as “Low Yow Edwin.” He was interrogated at the beginning of World War II as he left the U.S. to serve as a fighter-pilot mechanic in China’s military. Finding his file came as a surprise.


“My job that day was just to go through the file and input the name that I saw on the header into the computer,” she said. “This file was sitting on the very end of this box. I thought, ‘That looks kind of close to my dad's name.’ I opened it up and there was a picture of him, at age 23, staring me in the face. I physically started shaking, I had tears, it was just unbelievable. It really helped to bring everything together for me.”




Lily Eng found the files of several family members, including her great-grandfather, who went by the name of “Hop Lee.”


“We had no pictures; my grandfather never spoke about him,” Eng said. “Only after I got the immigration files, I realized that my great-grandfather had died in 1918, so my grandfather had never met him. His father had returned to America before my grandfather was born.”


Joyce Liu, who joined the project as a volunteer a year ago, said the stories revealed through the files made her appreciate the resilience of the earlier generation of Chinese people who came to America.


“I look at the tidbits of their lives, and it looks tough,” she said. “An arrival form of a mom who came back with her son from China that says that her son died on board of the ship … I was shocked. I mean, the mom must be devastated. It also dawned on me, how long was that voyage from the southern China to Seattle?”


Liu sees the Chinese people who arrived in America during the Chinese Exclusion Act period as pioneers.


“The history can really help us put things in perspective as a Chinese American here, and I just hope that history doesn't repeat itself,” she said.

## US Sanctions Russian Firms Over 'Fake Websites'

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions Wednesday against two people and their Russia-based companies it accused of supporting a Kremlin-directed disinformation campaign involving the impersonation of legitimate news websites.


The sanctions targeted Moscow-based company Social Design Agency and its founder, Ilya Andreevich Gambashidze, as well as the Russian-based Company Group Structura and its owner, Nikolai Aleksandrovich Tupikin, according to a statement from the Treasury Department.


On behalf of the Russian government, they handled a network of more than 60 websites that mimicked media organizations and used fake social media accounts to amplify their content, the statement said.


"The fake websites appeared to have been built to carefully mimic the appearance of legitimate news websites," the Treasury Department said.


"The fake websites included embedded images and working links to legitimate sites."


The sanctions come amid heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, now in its third year.


The United States has repeatedly accused Moscow of orchestrating what it calls global "malign influence campaigns" aimed at sowing instability in democratic countries.


Last October, a U.S. intelligence report said Russia was using its spy network, state-run media and social media to undermine public trust in elections around the world.


The United States shared the report with some 100 countries.


"We are committed to exposing Russia's extensive campaigns of government-directed deception, which are intended to mislead voters and undermine trust in democratic institutions in the United States and around the world," Brian E. Nelson, under-secretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, was quoted as saying in Wednesday's statement.


U.S.-based disinformation researchers say hundreds of sites mimicking news outlets — powered by artificial intelligence — have cropped up in recent months, fueling an explosion of false narratives, about subjects ranging from war to politicians.


That includes several Russian-linked websites mimicking news outlets and pushing Kremlin propaganda ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, according to researchers at Clemson University and the watchdog organization NewsGuard.

## Efforts by US to Crack Down on TikTok Spark Backlash Against Israel

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The initial backlash came quickly.


Within hours of last week’s vote in the House of Representatives approving legislation that could lead to a ban of the popular TikTok app in the United States, anger and outrage poured onto multiple social media platforms.


Some of the anger targeted U.S. lawmakers who supported the bill. Some focused on China.


And a number of social media accounts, some with large followings, put the blame on Israel and pro-Jewish groups in the United States.


“A foreign government is influencing the 2024 election,” Briahna Joy Gray posted on X.


“I'm not talking about China, but Israel,” added the former national press secretary for Senator Bernie Sanders’ 2020 presidential campaign.




 


Jake Shields, a former mixed martial arts fighter who has used social media in the past to share his views on transgender issues, blamed the Anti-Defamation League and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC.


“The ADL said Tiktok Is a threat to Israel,” Shields posted on X. “AIPAC the Israeli lobby gave Dan Crebsahaw [sic] millions of dollars Now Crenshaw fights to ban TikTok.”




And journalist Glenn Greenwald said on X that the TikTok legislation gained momentum only after “Bipartisan DC became enraged so many Americans were allowed to criticize Israel” using the TikTok app.




 


Other posts and videos were quickly shared across other major platforms, including TikTok and Facebook.


U.S. officials contacted by VOA said the rush by some social media users to blame Israel or Jewish groups was not a surprise.


“Unfortunately, there are antisemitic people in America who will blame Israel and the Jewish people for anything, even Congress banning a Chinese-controlled app,” Republican Senator Marco Rubio said in a statement to VOA.




“Their love for TikTok is no coincidence; it’s a tool used by the Chinese Communist Party to sow division and weaken our nation,” said Rubio, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a supporter of the legislation. “We can debate Middle East policy, but we must not tolerate hate or allow Communist China to manipulate our discourse.”


The FBI, which has warned repeatedly over the last several months both about the danger of TikTok and about a rising tide of antisemitism across the country, declined to comment, pointing to comments made by Director Christopher Wray at congressional hearings earlier this month.


“Americans need to ask themselves whether they want to give the Chinese government the ability to control access to their data, whether they want to give the Chinese government the ability to control the information they get through their recommendation algorithm,” Wray told House lawmakers during the annual Worldwide Threats hearing last week.


“When it comes to the algorithm and the recommendation algorithm and the ability to conduct influence operations, that is extraordinarily difficult to detect,” Wray added.


Researchers who track influence operations on social media, while wary, tell VOA that they have yet to see evidence that the spread of conspiracy theories blaming Israel or Jewish groups for the TikTok legislation is part of a concerted campaign.


“The period after 10/7 [Hamas terror attack on Israel] made clear that antisemitic conspiracies can spread rapidly across TikTok just by the nature of the platform's algorithm, so no external coordination would be required as an explanation,” said Ben Dubow, president of Washington-based Omelas, which uses a combination of data collection, artificial intelligence and experts to track and analyze online disinformation and influence operations.


Dubow did not rule out the possibility that TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, could be giving the anti-Israel and antisemitic posts more play if the Chinese government thought it might be helpful.


“The scant research available on TikTok's algorithm often suggests ByteDance privileges content favorable to CCP [Chinese Communist Party] policy goals,” he said.


Omelas also found the conspiracy theories received some attention from other media outlets, including Russia-controlled RT and Qatar-based Al Jazeera.


“We're seeing a few posts from RT and Al Jazeera tying the renewed push for a ban to TikTok's role in the spread of ‘anti-Zionism’ in response to October 7,” Dubow said. “But none tying it explicitly to AIPAC and ADL.”


Geoff Roth, a professor of practice and journalism at the University of Houston, agreed the surge of social media posts echoing the Israel-TikTok narrative appeared to be “more organic.”


“The Israel conspiracy theory, as I like to put it, just seems to be coming from people who in general post stuff that is anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian,” he told VOA.


“It comes from different sides of the political spectrum,” Roth said. “But I think there’s people on both sides of the political spectrum that have a lot of anti-Israeli sentiment because of what’s going on in Gaza.”


Roth also noted that the theory tying the TikTok legislation to Israel and Jewish groups, while possibly the most prominent, is not the only narrative that gained traction following the bill’s passage in the House.


“There's the narrative of security and concerns about the [Chinese]Communist Party and whether or not that [the legislation] is justified,” he said. “And then sort of the more far out things out there like, this is a Republican plot to get younger voters to be against Biden because if Biden signed it into law, he's going to lose votes from younger people.”


One account on X pushing the Republican plot theory called the TikTok legislation “another trick.”




A second X account added, “I’d wager Republicans who just voted for a TikTok Ban will rename it the ‘Biden Ban the moment he signs it and within weeks that will be the official name and all anyone remembers.”

## Judge Allows Trump to Appeal Ruling Keeping DA on Georgia Election Case

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

ATLANTA, GEORGIA — The judge overseeing the Georgia election interference case is allowing Donald Trump to appeal a ruling letting Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis remain on the prosecution. 


Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee on Wednesday granted a request by defense attorneys to ask the Georgia Court of Appeals to review the judge's decision. It's now up to the appeals court to decide whether the court will hear it. 


McAfee in a ruling last week denied the defense's request to disqualify Willis from the case or dismiss the indictment over her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade. The judge said Willis can remain on the case if Wade resigns, which Wade did on Friday. 


But the judge also rebuked Willis for her "tremendous" lapse in judgment and questioned the truthfulness of Wade's and her testimony about the timing of their relationship. 


Wade's resignation allowed Willis to remain on the most sprawling of four criminal cases against the presumptive Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election. 


But the long-term damage to the public perception of the prosecution remains unclear, particularly considering Trump's relentless barrage of attacks on the pair who pledged to hold Trump accountable but found their own actions under a public microscope. 


Wade offered his resignation in a letter to Willis, saying he was doing so "in the interest of democracy, in dedication to the American public and to move this case forward as quickly as possible." 


"I will always remember — and will remind everyone — that you were brave enough to step forward and take on the investigation and prosecution of the allegations that the defendants in this case engaged in a conspiracy to overturn Georgia's 2020 Presidential Election," Willis wrote. 


Trump's team felt differently. 


In a social media post, Trump said the "Fani Willis lover" had "resigned in disgrace," and Trump repeated his assertion that the case is an effort to hurt his campaign to reclaim the White House in November. Trump has denied doing anything wrong and pleaded not guilty. 


Attorneys for Trump and the other defendants had said a failure to remove Willis could imperil any convictions and force a retrial if an appeals court later finds it was warranted. 


"Neither the Court nor the Parties should run an unnecessary risk of having to go through that process more than once," they wrote.

## The EPA’s Final Auto Emission Rules Are Out

date: 2024-03-20, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTc4MDk4Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NDY3ODQ1OX0.kH9Q3K9socwxDcPz9_tACQ7D7YsCke4bJnWfgeTxFFU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The Biden administration announced final new emissions standards for cars on Wednesday, significantly curtailing both the carbon dioxide and the toxic soot and chemicals that spew from the tailpipes of the nation’s light- and medium-duty vehicles.
</p><p>
	With that, Biden is checking off one of the two most important pieces of 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bidens-unfinished-climate-agenda" target="_self">unfinished climate business</a> he has left on his first term to-do list. The rules tighten pollution limits gradually over six years, beginning in 2027. In concert with other Biden policies including consumer tax credits for electric vehicles purchases, initiatives to build out charging infrastructure, and support for domestic manufacturing, the standards will help accelerate the transition to electric vehicles that is already well underway.
</p><p>
	Transportation is responsible for more planet-warming emissions than 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/americas-carbon-emissions-fell-for-the-first-time-since-covid" target="_self">any other part</a> of the U.S. economy. To get the country on the path of reaching net zero emissions by 2050, as Biden has set out to do, curbing car emissions is unavoidable.
</p><p>
	When the rules were originally proposed last year, we 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/epa-car-emissions-evs-takeaways" target="_self">wrote</a> that they would “roughly halve carbon pollution from America’s massive car and truck fleet, the world’s third largest, within a decade.” That’s still broadly the case, even though the final version features one big change: Automakers will now have more time to cut emissions from their fleets. They will still have to achieve the same standard in 2032 as what was originally proposed, but they can transition to it more slowly.
</p><p>Ahead of the official release, senior administration officials downplayed the significance of the slower rollout. They argued that giving automakers, dealers, and labor unions more time in the near-term would make for a sturdier rule, and that the cumulative emissions benefits of the final standard converge with the original proposal. At a White House event on Wednesday, members of the president’s climate team built on that message, framing the new rules not as a government mandate but rather as a tool to give consumers more of what they already want. “We are witnessing a technological revolution driven by the markets,” Environmental Protection Agency administrator Michael Regan proclaimed.</p><p>Also speaking at the event was John Bozzella, head of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most U.S. automakers, including the Big Three. Bozzella praised the administration for heeding the industry’s concerns over the original proposal’s rapid phase-in and said the new rules were “much improved” from what had initially been proposed. “Pace matters to automakers,” he said. “It certainly matters to consumers.” </p><p>
	The full rule was released mid-day Wednesday, and we’re digging through it to find out exactly what else has changed. But here’s what we know so far.</p><h3>What do the rules say?</h3><p>
	The rules strengthen greenhouse gas emission limits, in terms of grams of CO2 per mile, that automakers will have to adhere to, on average, across their product lines. They also tighten limits on dangerous pollutants, including particulate matter — the tiny bits that make up soot — and nitrogen oxides.
</p><p>
	This chart shows how the cuts in the final rule compare to those proposed in the draft rule. The version released last April required automakers to make steeper reductions to carbon emissions in the first three years, while the final rule allows for a more gradual reduction.
</p><center><iframe aria-label="Interactive line chart" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="434" id="datawrapper-chart-MrbCI" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MrbCI/4/" style="border: none;" title="The Evolution of Auto Emission Targets" width="680"></iframe></center><h3>Will the rules ban gas-powered cars?</h3><p>
	No. They are what’s called technology-neutral standards, meaning that automakers have options for how to comply with them. Since automakers have to meet the emissions targets on average across their fleets, rather than for each vehicle, it’s likely they’ll produce a range of options in 2032, including plug-in hybrids, regular hybrids, and even some gas cars with improved efficiency — though their fleets will probably have a much higher proportion of EVs than they do now.
</p><p>
	While that generally hasn’t changed from the preliminary rule, the Biden administration’s messaging around it has.
</p><p>
	When it released the initial proposal, the EPA emphasized that the least-cost path to achieving the standards would be for about two-thirds of new vehicles sold in 2032 to be electric. Although this was just one potential scenario, it was widely interpreted as a target or even a mandate — particularly by Biden’s 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change#electric-vehicles" target="_self">political</a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/evs-trump-uaw-jobs-evidence" target="_self">opponents</a>.
</p><p>
	On Tuesday, administration officials said that the two-thirds finding had been based on limited data. The EPA now estimates that EVs may make up anywhere between 30% and 56% of new light-duty sales from model years 2030 to 2032.
</p><h3>How much carbon pollution will the rules avoid?</h3><p>
	By 2032, the light-duty fleet on offer from automakers will emit half as much carbon as vehicles on the market in 2026.
</p><p>
	The EPA estimates that these rules will avoid 7.2 billion metric tons of carbon from 2027 to 2055, which accounts for the vehicles’ full lifetime on the road. That’s slightly less than the 7.3 billion metric tons the initial proposal would have avoided.
</p><h3>How will the rules affect new car-buyers?</h3><p>
	The rules will change the mix of vehicles sold by automakers, encouraging dealers to sell more hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles. They’re also expected to save Americans roughly $62 billion in fuel costs and avoided maintenance costs, since the EPA assumes that EVs are still cheaper to operate and maintain. On average, a consumer will save about $6,000 over the lifetime of a 2032 vehicle compared to one sold in 2026, according to the agency.
</p><p>
	The tailpipe rule will likely increase the cost of building each vehicle, which could translate into higher prices for consumers. However, state and federal tax incentives — as well as the cheaper cost of operating and fueling EVs — will offset that increase.
</p><h3>How will the rules affect people who don’t own a car — or who don’t plan to buy one soon?</h3><p>
	The rules are projected to deliver major health and environmental benefits to the public. The EPA estimates they will produce $37 billion in benefits from improved public health and climate mitigation, including avoided hospitalizations and premature deaths.
</p><p>
	This is what the EPA was created to do — use the best available science to protect human health and the environment. But even after decades of improvements in air quality, there is still a lot of room for improvement. More than one third of the population still live in places with unhealthy levels of ozone or particulate pollution, according to The American Lung Association’s most recent “
	<a href="https://www.lung.org/getmedia/338b0c3c-6bf8-480f-9e6e-b93868c6c476/SOTA-2023.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state of the air</a>” report. The risks are deeply unequal, with people of color making up half of those exposed. The report also noted that climate change is making it harder to protect people, as heat, drought, and wildfires increasingly lead to spikes in these pollutants. Altogether, ozone and particulate matter are responsible for more than 60,000 premature deaths annually, <a href="https://www.stateofglobalair.org/data/#/health/plot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Health Effects Institute</a>, a nonprofit, independent research organization funded by the EPA and automakers.
</p><h3>How is the Biden administration selling the rule?</h3><p>
	Officials stressed that EV sales are already 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-3-inflation-reduction-act" target="_self">shattering analyst predictions</a>, prices are dropping, and product availability is growing. They see this rule as part of a larger ecosystem of policies — including those in the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and Science Act — that are revitalizing American manufacturing and creating jobs while also contributing to the global fight against climate change. The EPA’s press release notes that companies have announced more than $160 billion in domestic clean vehicle manufacturing, and that the auto manufacturing sector as a whole has added more than 100,000 jobs since Biden took office.
</p><p>
	The administration is also, perhaps less loudly, selling the pollution standards as a path to freedom from fossil fuels. During the press call Tuesday, a senior administration official said the rules would enable consumers to break loose from the oil industry’s grip on how we get around and how much it costs us.
</p><h3>What happens next?</h3><p>
	The new rules kick in for cars in model year 2027, which will go on sale in 2026 and are being designed right now. Although the Biden administration has 
	<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/climate/biden-epa-auto-emissions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">suggested</a> that the new rules have won the support of the car industry — including automakers, labor unions, and dealerships — it could still face a court challenge from attorneys general in Republican-controlled states. Republican officials <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/republican-ags-pledge-to-sue-sec-over-emissions-disclosure-rules" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have repeatedly sued</a> to block the Biden administration’s climate policies.
</p><p>
	It’s unclear how the Supreme Court would respond to such a challenge. Although the Court has long 
	<a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/05-1120" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backed</a> the EPA’s ability to limit climate pollution from cars and trucks, its hard-right majority has recently rolled back what were once thought to be bedrock environmental laws. In this term alone, the Court seems likely to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/21/emissions-states-epa-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">restrict</a> the EPA’s ability to regulate toxic air pollution while <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/environmental-law-review/blog/what-overruling-chevron-could-mean-for-environmental-law/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sweeping away</a> a central legal doctrine of environmental regulation.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect the White House event announcing the new rules.</em><br/></p>

## West Eyes New Measures After Passage of Hong Kong Security Law

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

Taipei, Taiwan — Hong Kong’s adoption of a second national security law Tuesday is being criticized by foreign governments, while some business figures say the law will hasten foreign businesses’ departure from the city.


The United Nations, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union expressed concern about the ambiguous language in the law and its speedy adoption, which was completed in less than two weeks.


U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk warned that the vague provisions in the bill, also known as Article 23, could lead to the criminalization of freedom of expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and the right to receive and impart information, which are all rights protected under international human rights law.


Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department said passage of Article 23 could accelerate the closing of a once-open society, adding that the U.S. is analyzing the potential impact of the law.


British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the law has failed to “provide certainty for international organizations, including diplomatic missions” operating in Hong Kong, and it will foster “the culture of self-censorship” that is now dominating the social and political landscape in the city.


Apart from reiterating concerns about the law’s potential impact on Hong Kong people’s basic rights and freedom, the EU said the bill’s increased penalties, extraterritorial reach and partial retroactive applicability are “also deeply worrying.”


Despite the international criticism, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee hailed the passage of Article 23 as “a historic moment for Hong Kong,” while the Chinese government expressed “full support” of the development.




Rights activists call for sanctions


While they welcome the concerns expressed by foreign governments, some human rights activists urged democratic countries to respond with more forceful measures.


“With the enactment of the Article 23 legislation, now is the time to impose sanctions on officials like Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee,” said Benedict Rogers, the CEO of U.K.-based nongovernmental organization Hong Kong Watch.


Since Hong Kong implemented the controversial national security law and detained dozens of pro-democracy activists and politicians in 2020, the U.S. is the only country that has imposed sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials, 24 of them in all.


Rogers said since the U.K. doesn’t want to damage trade relations with China, the British government remains reluctant to impose sanctions on Chinese officials over the deteriorating conditions in Hong Kong.


“[While] they imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials over the human rights violations in Xinjiang, they haven’t done anything similar on Hong Kong,” he told VOA by phone.


While the U.S. has introduced some tools to counter China’s tightening control over Hong Kong — including sanctions, new legislation to ban the export of certain items to Hong Kong and the elimination of Hong Kong’s special status — some observers urged Washington to roll out more forceful measures following the passage of the Article 23.


“There’s a lot that Congress and the administration can do, including issuing additional sanctions against people responsible for the implementation of the two national security laws and advancing other existing legislations related to Hong Kong,” Samuel Bickett, a Washington-based human rights activist, told VOA by phone.


In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken Thursday, leaders of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China and the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party urged him to consider imposing new sanctions against officials responsible for undermining freedom and rule of law in Hong Kong.


They also vowed to advance the Hong Kong Economic Trade Office Certification Act and the Transnational Repression Policy Act through Congress. Once passed, the two bills would require Hong Kong to shut down its trade offices in the U.S. and allow the U.S. government to impose sanctions against Chinese or Hong Kong officials responsible for launching transnational repression against dissidents in the U.S. 




Laws’ effect on immigration, business


Apart from adopting more forceful measures against the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, Bickett and Rogers think democratic countries should introduce new immigration measures to accommodate the growing number of Hong Kong citizens leaving the city. According to statistics from Bloomberg, around 500,000 people have left Hong Kong since 2021.


While the U.K. has introduced an immigration program for holders of British Overseas Passports from Hong Kong, which was recently extended to more young people, Rogers hopes other countries, including the U.S. and those in Europe, can create similar programs tailored for Hong Kongers.


“I would like to see the EU and the U.S. offer some options so Hong Kongers who don’t qualify for the U.K.’s immigration scheme can have alternative options,” he said.


Since the Article 23 legislation uses vague language to define espionage and theft of state secrets, some analysts say foreign businesses may face serious challenges when conducting due diligence investigations or seeking information.


“This could be a big blow to banks and financial institutions, and it will further discourage investors from coming to Hong Kong since access to information is now further restricted,” Eric Lai, an expert on Hong Kong’s legal system at Georgetown Center for Asian Law, told VOA by phone.


Some analysts say the growing uncertainty in the business environment would lead more foreign businesses to consider leaving Hong Kong.


“Article 23 will hasten the departure of international businesses unless the Hong Kong government quickly establishes guard rails constricting the operational boundaries of the new law,” Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research, told VOA in a written response.

	The report came on the same day that climatologist Gavin Schmidt, Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, penned a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a9e3150a0e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">commentary</a> in <em>Nature</em> explaining that the planet warmed 0.2 degrees Celsius more last year than climate scientists expected, and nobody knows why. “Many reasons for this discrepancy have been proposed but, as yet, no combination of them has been able to reconcile our theories with what has happened,” Schmidt said. He suggests new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b9443eff2a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">regulations on sulfur emissions in the shipping industry</a> could be playing a part, but said “if the anomaly does not stabilize by August ... then the world will be in uncharted territory.”
</p><h3>2. BYD CEO thinks hybrids and EVs will soon make up half of China’s car sales</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The CEO of Chinese EV maker BYD predicts electric and hybrid vehicle sales could make up 50% of auto sales in China within the next three months, <em>Electrek</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=89daa734e5&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. New energy vehicles (which include fully-electric cars as well as hybrids) hit a 48.2% share last week, “and if it continues at this rate, I estimate that the penetration could cross 50% in the next three months,” Wang Chuanfu said over the weekend. That’s a dramatic shortening of the time frame compared to a month ago, when Wang said the 50% mark could be reached by the end of the year. Last year, NEVs accounted for 35% of China’s auto sales. In the U.S., hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and fully electric vehicles rose to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3b7736d2ed&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">about</a> 18% of total new light-duty vehicle sales in 2023.
</p><h3>3. EPA’s new tailpipe rules expected today</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The EPA is expected to announce its new tailpipe emissions rules for cars and light-duty trucks “as soon as” today, so be on the lookout for that. The rules have likely been softened to give automakers more time to ramp up electric vehicle sales, but still with the expectation that EVs will make up two-thirds of all new car sales by 2032 (last year EVs accounted for about one-tenth of sales). A similar standard for heavy-duty trucks is expected in the next few weeks,<em> E&E News </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4bbfb73986&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>.

The rice fields in the Mekong Delta feed the country’s 90 million people, but the lack of rain over the last month has left rice paddies and fruit farms parched.

One watchdog group, Break Free From Plastic, called the new design the “bare minimum.” “Plastic recycling is never going to make a dent in the plastic pollution crisis — plastic was never designed to be recycled, and it cannot be recycled indefinitely,” Emma Priestland from Break Free from Plastic told CNN. “Coca-Cola needs to urgently and dramatically reduce its use of plastic — full stop,” she said. In 2023 the group named Coca-Cola the world’s top plastic polluter for the sixth year in a row.

## Biden Touts America's 'Future' as Government Invests $8.5 Billion in Chipmaker Intel

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

Chandler, Arizona — President Joe Biden on Wednesday celebrated an agreement to provide Intel with up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion in loans for computer chip plants around the country, talking up the investment in the political battleground state of Arizona and calling it a way of "bringing the future back to America."


The Biden administration has predicted that the cash infusion should help the U.S. boost its global share of advanced chip production from zero to 20%. The Democratic president highlighted the investment while visiting Intel's Ocotillo campus in Chandler, Arizona, where he inspected silicon wafers and expressed amazement at how thin the chips were.


In remarks after the tour, Biden talked about the impact his policies could have on the U.S. economy as he tries to translate his policy wins into a political boost ahead of November's election. Intel plans to invest in facilities in Arizona, Ohio, Oregon and New Mexico, with some of the government money helping to support workforce development.


"This isn't just about investing in America," Biden said. "It's about investing in the American people as well."


Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the deal reached through her department would put the United States in a position to produce 20% of the world's most advanced chips by 2030, up from zero. The United States designs advanced chips, but its inability to make them domestically has emerged as a national security and economic risk.


"Failure is not an option — leading-edge chips are the core of our innovation system, especially when it comes to advances in artificial intelligence and our military systems," Raimondo said on a call with reporters. "We can't just design chips. We have to make them in America."


The funding announcement came amid the heat of the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden has been telling voters that his policies have led to a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing and job growth. His message is a direct challenge to former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, who raised tariffs while in the White House and wants to do so again on the promise of protecting U.S. factory jobs from China.


U.S. adults have dim views of Biden's economic leadership, with just 34% approving, according to a February poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. The lingering impact of inflation hitting a four-decade high in 2022 has hurt the Democrat, who had a 52% approval on the economy in July 2021.


Intel's projects would be funded in part through the bipartisan 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which the Biden administration helped shepherd through Congress at a time of concerns after the pandemic that the loss of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into a recession.


When pushing for the investment, lawmakers expressed concern about efforts by China to control Taiwan, which accounts for more than 90% of advanced computer chip production.


Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat up for reelection this year, stressed that his state would become "a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing" as Intel would be generating thousands of jobs. Ohio has voted for Trump in the past two presidential elections, and Brown in November will face Republican Bernie Moreno, a Trump-backed businessman from Cleveland.


Wednesday's announcement is the fourth and largest so far under the chips law, with the government support expected to help enable Intel Corp. to make $100 billion in capital investments over five years. About 25% of that total would involve building and land, while roughly 70% would go to equipment, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said.


"We think of this as a defining moment for the United States, the semiconductor industry and for Intel," said Gelsinger, who called the CHIPS Act "the most critical industrial policy legislation since World War II."


Biden administration officials say that computer chip companies would not be investing domestically at their expected scale without government support. Intel funding would lead to a combined 30,000 manufacturing and construction jobs. The company also plans to claim tax credits from the Treasury Department worth up to 25% on qualified investments.


The Santa Clara, California-based company will use the funding in four states. In Chandler, Arizona, the money will help to build two new chip plants and modernize an existing one. The funding will establish two advanced plants in New Albany, Ohio, which is just outside the state capital of Columbus.


The company will also turn two of its plants in Rio Rancho, New Mexico, into advanced packaging facilities. And Intel will also modernize facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon.

## Cheating Automatic Toll Booths by Obscuring License Plates

date: 2024-03-20, updated: 2024-03-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/sneaky-drivers-dodging-toll-cameras-cost-authorities-millions-5941fe31?st=y6zwgzfhmswlb0b&#038;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">reporting</a> on a variety of techniques drivers are using to obscure their license plates so that automatic readers can&#8217;t identify them and charge tolls properly.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some drivers have power-washed paint off their plates or covered them with a range of household items such as leaf-shaped magnets, Bramwell-Stewart said. The Port Authority says officers in 2023 roughly doubled the number of summonses issued for obstructed, missing or fictitious license plates compared with the prior year.</p>
<p>Bramwell-Stewart said one driver from New Jersey repeatedly used what&#8217;s known in the streets as a flipper, which lets you remotely swap out a car&#8217;s real plate for a bogus one ahead of a toll area. In this instance, the bogus plate corresponded to an actual one registered to a woman who was mystified to receive the tolls. &#8220;Why do you keep billing me?&#8221; Bramwell-Stewart recalled her asking...</p></blockquote>

<h4>Too busy not using X to notice</h4> <p>Brits are satisfied with the speed of their mobile network, research finds, despite the UK having some of the slowest average 5G download speeds among G7 nations. Twitter is also no longer among the top 10 most used mobile apps.…</p>

## What the New Rivians Say About the Future of EVs

date: 2024-03-20, from: Heatmap News

	Earlier this month, the electric-car maker Rivian <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-suv-r2-r3-r3x" target="_blank">announced</a> its new SUV, the R2 — a $45,000 family hauler that will get more than 300 miles in range. It also debuted the R3 and R3X hatchbacks, which entranced online car nerds.
</p><p>
	These new Rivian models are sleek and important, but they won’t go on sale until 2026 at the earliest. Can Rivian last that long? We also chat about how electric vehicles’ physical requirements — big batteries, high voltage wires — are changing the design of cars themselves.
</p><p>
	In this week’s episode, Rob and Jesse discuss Rivian’s quest to survive, how electrification is creating new vehicle categories, and the coolest EVs coming down the pike.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
	<span></span>
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> There’s this term called carcinization in evolutionary biology. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> Ooh.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer:</strong> People know this meme, which is that things in the sea tend to evolve into crabs. There’s lots of animals that look like crabs in the sea that are not true crabs, so to speak, because the crab is like a very successful bottom dweller form factor. And so animals that do not start as crabs, once they fill the same ecological niche as crabs, will wind up looking like crabs after you know 10 million, 15 million years.<br/><br/>
To remember another guy, I have been thinking also a lot of the — again, if you’re not driving, Google this — the 1990s Toyota Previa, which was a kind of, it was a minivan that was like a half oval. It was kind of pill shaped. And again, the wheels were right at the front and right at the back. It was a more successful car, you’ll see it, it was the iconic 90s Toyota minivan.
	<br/>
<br/>
	And I do feel like, to some degree, the whole car market is undergoing this process of carcinization, where what is actually the vehicle that people want the most, especially families want the most, is a minivan. But minivans are not seen as cool or rugged, and so the whole car market is like trying to generate a vehicle that is as close to the Previa as possible but does not look like a mini— You know, it’s not actually, but to some degree I feel like we keep evolving minivans again and again. 
	<br/>
<br/>
	If you think about the history of what the family car has been, where it was a station wagon in the 70s and 80s, then it was a minivan. Now it's this crossover SUV thing.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, because they make a lot of sense.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>Those are, broadly, very similar cars. They’re very similar, right? They let you seat two to three kids and they give you a lot of space in the back. But as fashion changes and what's cool, we have to keep redesigning that form factor for just what’s trendy at the moment. But we’re just dancing around this common design.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>Yeah, it’s really interesting. There’s such a funny love hate relationship out there with minivans. I mean, they are  incredibly useful cars, right? But it’s so hard culturally. It’s so hard to be like, <em>Oh, I got a minivan, I gotta drive a minivan now</em>. I turned 40 this year, so I’m right there. I grew up—<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>You're closer to your midlife crisis than I am here.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins:</strong> —in a household with, originally, when I was first born, they had two Volkswagen bugs. And then as we, my sister and I grew up and we needed more space, both my parents traded in their bugs for Volkswagen minibuses. So we had the Volkswagen bus. And it was like the best family car growing up, right? Because we could all camp in it. Like, you know, we could throw the back seat down and put a mattress there. One of us could sleep on the floor, the middle seats. All my friends would fit inside it for trips to the beach. You know, it was just a super useful vehicle. <br/>
<br/>
	And of course that, you know, that sort of design atrophied out  in terms of the mass market. People still buy them to convert for campers and things like that, like the Volkswagen California and other kinds of models like that in the van segment. But it’s interesting, the ID.4 Buzz is coming back to the market in the U.S. this year, as well. It’s the sort of rebirth of theVolkswagen microbus, and I'm really curious to see how it does because it’s a cool design. It’s a very retro forward, right? Which is very similar to how the R3 looks, I'd say. <br/>
<br/>
	I'll come back to that in a minute. But I’m really curious to see how it sells. I know my family’s been really interested in it, waiting for it to come out and see what it actually looks like in real life, and maybe test drive it and see if it’s something we might want in the future. But I would love to see more in that category, right? The van.<br/>
<br/>
	And you know, the SUV is really just trying to imitate a van with rugged looks that you really don't need. If you just admit it, you just want a minivan.<span></span>

## March 19, 2024

date: 2024-03-20, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

In Florida, Kansas, Ohio, Illinois, and Arizona, Republican voters chose their presidential candidate today. The results highlight the weaknesses former president Trump is bringing to the 2024 presidential contest. Trump, who is the only person still in the Republican race, won all five of today&#8217;s Republican races. But the results showed that his support is soft. Results are still coming in, but as I write this, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, who has suspended her campaign, received between 13% and 20% of the vote, Florida governor Ron DeSantis&#8212;who has also suspended his campaign&#8212;picked up votes, and &#8220;none of the names shown&#8221; got more than 5% in Kansas.

## How Texas' Plans to Arrest Migrants Would Work

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

McALLEN, Texas — A law that would allow Texas law enforcement to arrest migrants suspected of illegally entering the U.S. is back on hold.


The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late Tuesday issued an order preventing its enforcement, just hours after the Supreme Court allowed the strict new immigration law to take effect.


The Justice Department is challenging the law, saying Texas is overstepping the federal government's immigration authority. Texas argues it has a right to take action over what the governor has described as an “invasion” of migrants on the border.


Here's what to know:


Who can be arrested? 


The law would allow any Texas law enforcement officer to arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally. Once in custody, migrants could either agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Migrants who don’t leave could face arrest again under more serious felony charges.


Arresting officers must have probable cause, which could include witnessing the illegal entry or seeing it on video. 


The law cannot be enforced against people lawfully present in the U.S., including those who were granted asylum or who are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.


Critics, including Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, fear the law could lead to racial profiling and family separation.


American Civil Liberties Union affiliates in Texas and some neighboring states issued a travel advisory a day after Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law. The advisory warns of a possible threat to civil and constitutional rights when passing through Texas. 


Abbott has rejected concerns over profiling. While signing the bill, he said troopers and National Guard members at the border can see migrants crossing illegally “with their own eyes.”


Where would the law be enforced? 


The law can be enforced in any of Texas' 254 counties, including those hundreds of miles from the border. 


But Republican state Rep. David Spiller, the law's author, has said he expects most arrests would occur within 80 kilometers of the U.S.-Mexico border. Texas' state police chief has expressed similar expectations.


Some places are off-limits. Arrests cannot be made in public and private schools, places of worship, or hospitals and other health care facilities, including those where sexual assault forensic examinations are conducted.


It is unclear where migrants ordered to leave might go. The law says they are to be sent to ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border, even if they are not Mexican citizens. However, Mexico’s government said Tuesday it would not accept the return of any migrants to its territory from the state of Texas.


Is the law constitutional? 


The Supreme Court's decision did not address the constitutionality of the law.

The Justice Department, legal experts and immigrant rights groups have said it is a clear conflict with the U.S. government’s authority to regulate immigration.


U.S. District Judge David Ezra, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan, agreed in a 114-page order. He added that the law could hamper U.S. foreign relations and treaty obligations.


Opponents have called the measure the most dramatic attempt by a state to police immigration since a 2010 Arizona law — denounced by critics as the “Show Me Your Papers” bill — that was largely struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. Ezra cited the Supreme Court's 2012 Arizona ruling in his decision.


Texas has argued that the law mirrors federal law instead of conflicting with it. 


What is happening on the border? 


Arrests for illegal crossings along the southern border fell by half in January from record highs in December. Border Patrol officials attributed the shift to seasonal declines and heightened enforcement by the U.S. and its allies. The federal government has not yet released numbers for February.


Texas has charged thousands of migrants with trespassing on private property under a more limited operation that began in 2021.


Tensions remain between Texas and the Biden administration. In the border city of Eagle Pass, Texas, National Guard members have prevented Border Patrol agents from accessing a riverfront park.


Other Republican governors have expressed support for Abbott, who has said the federal government is not doing enough to enforce immigration laws. Other measures implemented by Texas include a floating barrier in the Rio Grande and razor wire along the border.

## China, Not Russia, Still Tops List of Threats to US

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Russia’s war in Ukraine — portrayed by top U.S. officials as posing a danger to the United States itself — still trails China when it comes to long-term threats to America’s security, according to a top Pentagon official.


The warning from Ely Ratner, the Defense Department’s assistant secretary for Indo-Pacific security affairs, comes in testimony prepared for a hearing Wednesday by the House Armed Services Committee on security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.


“The PRC [People’s Republic of China] continues to present the most comprehensive and serious challenge to our national security,” Ratner is set to tell lawmakers, according to a copy his opening statement obtained by VOA.


“The PRC remains the only country with the will and increasingly the capability to dominate the Indo-Pacific region and displace the United States,” Ratner warns, adding, “the PRC is pursuing its revisionist goals with increasingly coercive activities in the Taiwan Strait, the South and East China seas, along the Line of Actual Control with India, and beyond.”


This is not the first time Ratner has addressed the growing threat from Beijing.


In October he called out China’s military for what he described as a “sharp increase” in risky behavior in the East and South China seas.


Ratner also cautioned, separately, that China’s leaders were “increasingly turning to the PLA [People's Liberation Army] as an instrument of coercion.”




Additionally, the Pentagon’s annual China Military Power report said that China’s nuclear arsenal has been growing faster than expected, while Beijing is building out the infrastructure needed for a further expansion of its nuclear forces.




China has responded to such allegations by accusing the U.S. of “hyping up” the threat.


On Tuesday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a warning of his own, emphasizing the threat from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.


"The United States stands by Ukraine because it's the right thing to do,” Austin told a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Ramstein, Germany. “But we also stand by Ukraine because it's crucial to our own security."


“The United States would face grave new perils in a world where aggression and autocracy are on the march and where tyrants are emboldened and where dictators think that they can wipe out democracy off the map," he said.


U.S. intelligence officials argued recently that the threats from Russia and China are linked, and that Russia’s war has served to embolden China's leadership.


Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told lawmakers earlier this month that Beijing has managed to get long-sought concessions from Moscow in exchange for support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.


And CIA Director William Burns said Russian success in Ukraine could “stoke the ambitions of the Chinese leadership in contingencies ranging from Taiwan to the South China Sea."




Ratner is set to tell U.S. lawmakers Wednesday that the Defense Department is working to strengthen key alliances in the Indo-Pacific and develop what he calls a “regional force posture” including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia.


He is also set to testify that the Pentagon’s proposed 2025 budget is placing a priority on investments in air, sea and undersea power, as well as in modernizing U.S. nuclear forces with an eye toward Beijing’s own military modernization efforts.

## Biden, Trump Notch Wins; Other Races Offer Hints on National Politics

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

COLUMBUS, Ohio  — As Joe Biden and Donald Trump moved closer to a November rematch, primary voters around the country on Tuesday urged their favored candidate to keep up the fight and worried about what might happen if their side loses this fall.


There was little suspense about Tuesday's results as both candidates are already their parties' presumptive nominees. Trump easily won Republican primaries in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio. Biden did the same except in Florida, where Democrats had canceled their primary and opted to award all 224 of their delegates to Biden.


Instead, the primaries and key downballot races became a reflection of the national political mood. With many Americans unenthusiastic about 2024's choice for the White House, both Biden and Trump's campaigns are working to fire up their bases by tearing into each other and warning of the perils of the opponent.


Those who did turn out to vote Tuesday seemed to hear that.


Pat Shackleford, an 84-year-old caregiver in Mesa, Arizona, said she voted for Trump in Arizona's primary to send the former president a message.


"I wanted to encourage him that the fight has been worthwhile, that more of us are behind him than maybe the media tells you," Shackleford said.


Jamie and Cassandra Neal, sisters who both live in Phoenix, said they were unenthusiastic Biden supporters until they saw the vigor the president brought to his State of the Union speech. It fired them up for the coming election.


"Beforehand it was like, 'Well, he's the only decent one there,'" said Cassandra Neal, 42. "After his address it was like, 'OK, let's do it!'"


Jamie Neal, 45, said Biden had been "way too nice" before and needed to match Trump, whom she described as "vicious."


"I hate to say it, sometimes you need to equal the lowness to get the person out," she said. "Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire."


In Ohio's Republican Senate primary, Trump-backed businessman Bernie Moreno defeated two challengers, Ohio Secretary of State Frank Frank LaRose and Matt Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians baseball team.


Moreno and Trump appeared together Saturday at a rally where Trump praised his endorsed candidate as a "warrior" and ramped up his dark rhetoric, saying that were he not to be elected, "it's going to be a bloodbath for the country." His campaign insists he was referring to the auto industry and not the country as a whole.


In the final days of the campaign, The Associated Press reported on Thursday that in 2008, someone with access to Moreno's work email account created a profile on an adult website seeking "Men for 1-on-1 sex." The AP could not definitively confirm that it was created by Moreno himself. Moreno's lawyer said a former intern created the account and provided a statement from the intern, Dan Ricci, who said he created the account as "part of a juvenile prank."


Questions about the profile have circulated in GOP circles for the past month, sparking frustration among senior Republican operatives about Moreno's potential vulnerability in a general election, according to seven people who are directly familiar with conversations about how to address the matter. They requested anonymity to avoid running afoul of Trump and his allies.


Trump and Biden have for weeks been focused on the general election, aiming their campaigns lately on states that could be competitive in November rather than merely those holding primaries.


Trump, a Florida voter, cast his ballot at a recreation center in Palm Beach on Tuesday and told reporters, "I voted for Donald Trump."


Trump and Biden are running on their records in office and casting the other as a threat to America. Trump, 77, portrays the 81-year-old Biden as mentally unfit. The president has described his Republican rival as a threat to democracy after his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results and his praise of foreign strongmen.


Those themes were evident Tuesday at some polling locations.


"President Biden, I don't think he knows how to tie his shoes anymore," said Trump supporter Linda Bennet, a resident of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, not far from the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort.


Even as she echoed Trump's arguments about Biden, she criticized Trump's rhetoric and "the way he composes himself" as "not presidential at all." But she said the former president is "a man of his word," and she said the country, especially the economy, felt stronger to her under Trump's leadership.


In Columbus, Ohio, Democrat Brenda Woodfolk voted for Biden and shared the president's framing of the choice this fall.


"It's scary," she said of the prospect that Trump could be in the Oval Office again. "Trump wants to be a dictator, talking about making America white again and all this kind of crap. There's too much hate going on."


Bennet and Woodfolk agreed that immigration is one of their top concerns, though they offered different takes on why.


"This border thing is out of control," said Bennet, the Republican voter. "I think it's the government's plot or plan to bring these people in to change the whole dynamic for their benefit, so I'm pretty peeved."


Woodfolk, the Democrat, said she doesn't mind immigrants "sharing" opportunities in the U.S. but worried it comes at the expense of "people who've been here all their lives."


Trump and Republicans have hammered Biden on the influx of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in recent years, seeking to capitalize on the issue well beyond border states. Biden has ratcheted up a counteroffensive in recent weeks after Senate Republicans killed a migration compromise they had negotiated with the White House, withholding their support only after Trump said he opposed the deal. Biden has used the circumstances to argue that Trump and Republicans have no interest in solving the issue but instead want to inflame voters in an election year.


For the last year, Trump has coupled his campaign with his legal challenges, including dozens of criminal counts and civil cases in which he faces more than $500 million in fines.


His first criminal trial was scheduled to start Monday in New York on allegations he falsified business records to cover up hush money payments. But a judge delayed the trial for 30 days after the recent disclosure of new evidence that Trump's lawyers said they needed time to review.


Speaking outside his polling place with a voter's sticker affixed to his lapel, Trump insisted the cases against him were political and defended himself against criticism of his attacks a day earlier on Jewish Democrats, in which he alleged they hate Israel and their own religion. Democratic leaders on Tuesday criticized his comments as promoting antisemitic tropes about having divided loyalties.


Standing next to him was former first lady Melania Trump, who didn't have on a sticker. She has rarely appeared in public with Trump since he launched his third bid for the White House.


Asked if she would campaign with him, she replied: "Stay tuned."

## American Muslim Groups Plan to Boycott White House Ramadan

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — American Muslims outraged by President Joe Biden's support of Israel say they will not take part in White House Ramadan and Eid celebrations this year as they continue to demand that the administration push for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza.


Should an invitation come, it's "widely understood" that American Muslim community leaders and organizations will decline, said Robert McCaw, director of the Government Affairs Department at the Council on American-Islamic Relations, CAIR.


"This decision is due to the administration's failure to address Muslim community demands for an immediate and permanent cease-fire," McCaw told VOA. "And its refusal to stop supplying manufactured weapons to Israel, which are being used in a genocide against our Palestinian brothers and sisters in Gaza."


Amid media reports that the administration is considering scaling back Ramadan events at the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said no celebration related to the holy month has been announced.




"We understand that it is a painful time for a number of communities," she told VOA during her press briefing Monday. Senior White House officials have met with members of the Arab, Muslim and Palestinian communities "to talk about their views, to voice their concerns, and we welcome that," she added.


The suffering of the Palestinian people "will be front of mind for many" Muslims this Ramadan, President Joe Biden said in a statement marking the beginning of the month. "It is front of mind for me."


Since taking office, Biden has continued the decadeslong White House tradition of hosting Muslim community leaders that began with President Bill Clinton in 1996. Both Republican and Democratic presidents have hosted iftar dinner during Ramadan or an Eid al Fitr reception to mark the end of fasting after the month.


But this year, in addition to potentially facing the embarrassment of a massive boycott, the White House would likely want to avoid scenes where Biden is shouted at and heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters. Several of them have disrupted his campaign events around the country.


Outrage over Gaza is also affecting Nowruz, the Persian New Year celebrated by diaspora groups of varying ethnicity and religious affiliation from countries beyond Iran, including Iraq, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.


Nowruz this year overlaps with Ramadan. And instead of inviting hundreds of people to a reception as the administration has done in the past, this weekend the White House will be hosting a "Nowruz Open House tour."


"I'm not sure if the president himself would participate," said Jawaid Kotwal, board member of the Afghan American Foundation. "So it's way different. A watered-down, downgraded version of the typical Nowruz celebrations that we had in the White House."


Kotwal told VOA that he personally declined the invitation but his organization will "look for any avenue to continue to have engagement with any occupant of the White House."


The White House has not responded to requests for further details on its Nowruz or Ramadan plans.


In his statement marking Nowruz, Biden said the war has "inflicted terrible suffering on the Palestinian people," and vowed to "continue to lead international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance to them."


Clouded by controversy


This year is not the first time Ramadan at the White House is clouded with controversy. In his first year in office, President Donald Trump, who campaigned on banning Muslims from entering the United States and signed multiple executive orders restricting immigration from Muslim-majority countries, did not host a Ramadan event.


In 2018 and 2019, Trump welcomed diplomats from Muslim-majority nations to the White House for iftar, but American Muslim organizations and lawmakers were not on the guest list. At the time, American Muslim groups said they would have declined had they been invited.


Some American Muslims boycotted Biden's virtual Eid celebrations in May 2021 as hostilities escalated between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. More than 260 Palestinians were killed in that round of violence, according to the United Nations.


That death toll is a fraction of the more than 31,000 Palestinians killed since Israel launched its military campaign in response to the Hamas October 7 attacks that took at least 1,200 lives in Israel and more than 240 people hostage. The level of anger felt now by American Muslims, Arabs and wide swaths of Biden's Democratic base is also exponentially higher.


The community, including those who work in the administration, would feel "gaslit" by a White House Ramadan event this year, said Tariq Habash, a Palestinian American and former policy adviser at the Department of Education who resigned in protest in January.


"You can't in one hand try and show solidarity and understanding and then in the other hand supply an unrestricted amount of weapons and military funding to an extremist government that is intent on the indiscriminate bombing and killing of civilians," Habash told VOA.


The White House said it has actively engaged with Arab and Muslim Americans since the October 7 Hamas attack. Some in the community have refused to meet with administration officials.


Begum Ersoz, Farhad Pouladi, Anita Powell and Sayed Aziz Rahman contributed to this report.

## South Africa Accuses US Congress of Adding it to a New ‘Axis of Evil’ Over Israel Genocide Case

date: 2024-03-20, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — South Africa seeks to limit the damage to its relations with Washington caused by its legal challenge to Israel’s assault on Gaza, a South African official said on Tuesday.


Naledi Pandor, who is South Africa's minister of international relations and cooperation, is in Washington seeking to sway members of the U.S. Congress from a proposed law that would further strain U.S. ties to Africa’s most vibrant democracy and a major mining, banking and manufacturing hub.


“I think there’s an attempt to take up punitive action against South Africa, this sort of axis of evil notion that’s very much part of the political culture,” Pandor said in response to a question from VOA at South Africa’s embassy in Washington.


In December, South Africa filed an application to institute proceedings against Israel at the United Nations’ top court. Pretoria argues that Israel’s actions in Gaza are “genocidal in character,” and aim to “destroy Palestinians in Gaza.”


In March, South Africa requested further measures from the International Court of Justice, accusing Israel of weaponizing starvation by preventing humanitarian aid from reaching the sealed-off exclave.


Israel’s government has denounced the case, and the White House told VOA in January it considers it “meritless.”


The case has since inspired a bipartisan push in the U.S. Congress for legislation mandating a full review of the bilateral relationship with South Africa. The draft bill, filed by Republican Representative John James and Democratic Representative Jared Moskowitz, claims that the actions of South Africa’s long-ruling African National Congress “are inconsistent with its publicly stated policy of nonalignment in international affairs.”


“South Africa has been building ties to countries and actors that undermine America’s national security and threaten our way of life through its military and political cooperation with China and Russia and its support of U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hamas,” James said in a statement when he introduced the bill in February. “We must examine our alliances and disentangle from those who remain willing to work with our adversaries.”


Pandor, who also met with think tanks and spoke publicly while in Washington, said she intended to remind members of Congress of the value of South Africa, on its own and as a gateway to the continent.


“We believe that any action to diminish the relationship would be most unwise,” she said, in response to another question from VOA. “Because these are two key democracies in the regions in which we exist.”


She said she believes the relationship between the United States and South Africa can help to promote peace and democracy on the African continent — and to support the agenda of development in Africa — “because I can't imagine how initiatives directed at greater trade and development would become operational if the institutional capacity of South Africa is not utilized.”


South Africa is also a major beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which offers duty-free U.S. market access to 32 African nations. Congress must vote on whether to extend the program beyond 2025.


VOA asked Pandor whether the high-stakes diplomatic pushback has been worth it.


“What I do know is if there's a struggle underway, the longer you take to address the demands of a struggle, the more violent and vicious the struggle becomes,” she replied. “So, the sooner you address peace and negotiations, the greater the opportunity for everybody to enjoy peace and security. This is the lesson of South Africa.”


And VOA asked analyst Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, if South Africa’s case had done anything to stop the conflict between Israel and Hamas.


“I don't think South Africa has reframed this conflict. I don't think South Africa has really changed the direction at this point,” he said. “But it's a thread that runs through it — this concern that South Africa has history which makes it especially sensitive to issues of discrimination and genocide. … It certainly added an element to conversation that wasn't there until South Africa pushed it as aggressively as it did.”


Pandor, a veteran member of the long-ruling African National Congress, stressed that Pretoria’s problem is not with the White House. She told VOA she had not sought meetings with President Joe Biden or Secretary of State Antony Blinken during her Washington visit.


“The executive understands [South Africa] far more than Congress,” she said.


When asked what she’d tell Biden, Pandor’s answer was short.


“Cease-fire,” she said. “Now.”
