## Why I feel bad about Biden

date: 2024-08-22, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>Podcast: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/22/whyIFeelBadAboutWhatHappenedToPresidentBidenInAPersonalWay.m4a">17 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>Note: You can skip the first five minutes, it's a long preamble on a different subject. I left it in because it's interesting imho. </p>
<p>It's possible that what happened to Joe Biden in the debate is like something that happened to me almost ten years ago when I was turning 60. I tell the story in this podcast. It's still possible he was the best choice to go against Trump. We'll know soon enough. But there's something to learn here. No one wants their life to be over. No one wants to be thanked. They want you to let them keep going. The thing is that all through life people say you can't do what you then go on to do. It happens over and over. One day, after a life of accomplishment, you realize everyone refers to you in the past tense, but you're still here, you want to keep doing the stuff you do so well. But they won't let you. That's why I feel bad about what happened with President Biden, because I've had the experience myself. Anyway what's done is done, we all have to get behind soon-to-be President Harris. And stand behind her as she is attacked, and they try to get rid of her. </p>
<p>Anyway, the substance of this podcast, which I recorded yesterday, doesn't start until 5:25. Up until then it's a rambling story about Fox News and how a little truth slipped out when they covered the assassination attempt on Trump a few weeks ago. You can skip over that part if you don't find it interesting, but I hope you do listen to the part when I had an experience that may have been like Biden's at the debate, and how it was probably just a panic attack -- these things happen -- our candidates are people, and they have bodies that do strange things sometimes. No matter what I feel for Biden and that's the story I wanted to tell here. </p>
<p>Thanks for listening. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span></p>

## AMD says Microsoft’s next big Windows 11 update will improve Zen 5 CPU performance

date: 2024-08-22, from: OS News

AMD says Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 11 version 24H2 update will improve performance for its new Zen 5 CPUs. The Ryzen 9000 series launched earlier this month, and failed to live up to AMD’s performance promises in most reviews. After rumors of a Windows bug, AMD has revealed that AMD-specific branch prediction code will be optimized in Windows 11 version 24H2, which is expected to ship next month. ↫ Tom Warren at The Verge It&#8217;s wild how seemingly small things can have a major impact on the launch of a new processor (or GPU) line these days. The main culprit behind the disappointing benchmarks upon launch of the Ryzen 9000 series turned out to be the 9000&#8217;s new branch prediction method, the code for which is not yet available in Windows. However, AMD ran their tests in &#8220;Admin mode&#8221;, which yielded results as if such code was actually present. AMD has said the branch prediction code needed to unlock the full potential of Ryzen 9000 chips in Windows and yield benchmark results comparable to AMD&#8217;s own internal tests and PR promiseswill be released next month as part of &#8220;Windows 11, version 24H2 in preview through the Windows Insider Program (Release Preview Channel &#8211; Build 26100) or by downloading the ISO here&#8220;. AMD claims this update will benefit users of previous Zen 5 and Zen 3 processors as well, but to a lesser degree. No word on if this issue affects Linux users in any way.

## The Stripped-Down Tesla Is Exactly What We Need

date: 2024-08-22, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzUwNTEwMi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDc1NTczN30.xgl1mYAA13i8Ik565f2nIVyCkQXkm9lBVIF47SePwtc/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">South of the border, Tesla quietly made its electric vehicles a little simpler.</p>
<p>The independent Tesla-tracking website <a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/2198/tesla-makes-significant-changes-to-model-3-in-mexico" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Not A Tesla App</u></a> recently shared news of a subtle change to the Tesla Model 3 that’s offered in Mexico compared to those for sale in the U.S. In place of the vegan faux leather that had been the sole option for its seats, Tesla offered ordinary cloth fabric as a choice. Luxury touches such as the heated or cooled seats aren’t available in this version of the Model 3. Nor is the rear touchscreen for backseat passengers to control their own temperature settings, a key addition to the redesigned Model 3 that recently debuted.</p>
<p>These changes don’t knock a lot off the cost of the EV: This rear-wheel drive 3 still costs 749,000 pesos, or about $40,000. But the introduction of a more stripped-down Tesla could be a signal that, just maybe, a more affordable Tesla is around the corner.</p>
<p>There’s no getting around it: Money may be the biggest stumbling block for EVs in the United States — at least as range anxiety dissipates thanks to better battery technology, growing charger networks, and people simply having more exposure to electric vehicles. The gap may be closing, but, in general, new EVs remain pricier than entry-level gas cars. Meanwhile, high interest rates are depressing auto sales of every kind and making comparably expensive EVs seem out of reach.</p>
<p>Electrics are expensive because of the costs to make their enormous batteries, the need to retool assembly lines to build a whole new kind of car, and other reasons mostly related to manufacturing. But on top of all that, they’re expensive because of how they’re positioned as a product. To get people excited about electric cars and see them not just as wimpy golf carts, carmakers led by Tesla sold the EV as the tech-forward ride of tomorrow. The look of EVs became all touchscreens and LEDs, smartphone features that meant to have us equate “electric” with “future.”</p>
<p>That design approach, combined with an emphasis on the zoominess an electric powertrain can deliver, gave EVs a sheen of luxury, even though the spartan conditions inside a Tesla bear little resemblance to the cushy environs of a Mercedes-Benz. It allowed Tesla — and Rivian and Lucid — to keep their startup companies afloat by selling expensive cars at the outset to maximize revenue. (It didn’t hurt that the high sticker price provided some room to hide the cost of the battery.)</p>
<p>That worked for the first phase of the EV revolution, when early tech adopters and climate-focused drivers jumped in. But that era is over. As the next era begins, success or failure will rest with the millions of people who make their car decisions on dollars and cents. The declining cost of batteries as companies get better at building them will help the electric vehicle get cheaper. But the other side of the coin is for companies to start selling the EV as just a car — a better one than your dinosaur gasoline-burner, yes, but not some smartphone on wheels sent back from the future.</p>
<p>This isn’t an entirely foreign notion. Cars have long been sold with various “trim levels” that include different packages of features at different price tiers. They’re usually designated by the alphabet soup you see at the end of a vehicle name, like Toyota Corolla XSE or Ford F-150 STX. In the case of the F-150, the extra technology and performance packages can <em><em>double</em></em> the starting price of $37,000.</p>
<p>You might think this is an annoying way to buy a car. The system hooks buyers with the promise of a low starting price, only for many to realize the car they actually want is $15,000 more. At the very least, though, it gives you the option to buy the cheap car if you can live without the fancier wheels, heated seats, and advanced suspension.</p>
<p>Gasoline cars could stand to do better in this regard, but it’s especially important for electric vehicles. Today’s market abounds with crossover EVs that pass themselves off as luxurious to get away with a price that bloats into the low $40,000s. Even with a few vehicles coming in the $30,000s, like the basic trim level of the Chevy Equinox EV and the promised revival of the Chevy Bolt, the useful-but-simple EV is a rare thing.</p>
<p>An EV is still an EV if it’s unremarkable. It’s just as good for reducing greenhouse emissions if it looks like my old Ford Escort on the inside: plain cloth seats, chunky physical buttons, and an analog speedometer on the dash. In many ways, it’d be better.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the pathway to what Tesla, Ford, and others envision when they <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/730514/tesla-model-3-mexico-interior/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promise us</u></a> the $25,000 EV. You’ll probably give up a little in terms of battery size and range, and lose some of the amenities and creature comforts. But what you get, finally, is a truly affordable EV. As someone who grew up on dead-simple transportation, I’d welcome it. </p>

## Andorra

date: 2024-08-22, from: mrusme blog

"Andorra, officially the Principality of Andorra, is a sovereign landlocked
country on the Iberian Peninsula, in the eastern Pyrenees, bordered by France
to the north and Spain to the south. Believed to have been created by
Charlemagne, Andorra was ruled by the count of Urgell until 988, when it was
transferred to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Urgell. The present principality
was formed by a charter in 1278. It is currently headed by two co-princes: the
bishop of Urgell in Catalonia, Spain and the president of France. Its capital
and largest city is Andorra la Vella."

Ford pumps the breaks on EV plans</h3><p>Yesterday Ford announced it is canceling its much-anticipated three-row EV crossover and producing it only as a hybrid, and delaying the release of a new medium-sized electric pickup truck to 2027. The moves deal a substantial blow to the company’s future EV offerings and mean “the North American car market may not see the explosive growth of EV options — the kind of efflorescence already happening in Europe and China — until the end of this decade,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-ev-suv-canceled?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_YUAcGEOIxVzKhg3cAXdN60unrIfp4KG9ILEGCT3lF0CJLTstkBjeMuQnrGU2ZsDAaCpX_" target="_self">said Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. </p><p>U.S. sales of electric vehicles actually reached a record high in the second quarter of 2024, <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q2-2024-ev-sales/" target="_blank">hitting 330,463</a>. That’s a 11.3% rise year-over-year, and a 23% jump compared to the first quarter. Ford’s quarterly EV sales were up 61% year-over-year. “The growth will, at times, be very slow, as all-time horizons in the automobile business are vast, but the long-term trajectory suggests that higher volumes of EVs will continue over time,” <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q2-2024-ev-sales/" target="_blank">said</a> Cox Automotive Industry Insights Director Stephanie Valdez Streaty. “As EV infrastructure and technology improve, and more models are launched, many shoppers sitting on the fence will eventually choose an EV.”</p><h3>3.

Isometric aims to “raise the bar for quality in carbon markets” by using robust monitoring, reporting, and verification measures to certify the credits after the carbon has been removed, rather than before. The verification is paid for by buyers instead of suppliers to avoid conflicts of interest. Buyers pay Isometric a flat fee, “ensuring one credit is always equal to one tonne of carbon dioxide durably removed from the atmosphere.” </p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>Renewables now make up 30% of total U.S. power generating capacity, <a href="https://cms.ferc.gov/media/energy-infrastructure-update-june-2024?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_YUAcGEOIxVzKhg3cAXdN60unrIfp4KG9ILEGCT3lF0CJLTstkBjeMuQnrGU2ZsDAaCpX_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p>

It&#8217;s no crisis, but it does mean the labor market has been cooling faster than expected.

## Dispute stops Canadian freight railroads, could cause US disruption

date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA

TORONTO — Both of Canada’s major freight railroads have come to a full stop because of a contract dispute with their workers, an impasse that could bring significant economic harm to businesses and consumers in Canada and the U.S. if the trains don’t resume running soon.


Canadian National and CPKC railroads both locked out their employees after the deadline of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Thursday passed without new agreements with the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference that represents some 10,000 engineers, conductors and dispatchers.


All rail traffic in Canada and all shipments crossing the U.S. border have stopped, although CPKC and CN’s trains will continue to operate in the U.S. and Mexico.


Billions of dollars of goods each month move between Canada and the U.S. via rail, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.


“If rail traffic grinds to a halt, businesses and families across the country will feel the impact," Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement. "Manufacturing workers, their communities and consumers of all sorts of products will be left reeling from supply chain disruptions.”


There will be other impacts as well, including on the more than 30,000 commuters in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal who will be scrambling to find a new way into work because their trains won’t be able to operate over CPKC’s tracks while the railroad is shut down.


Business groups had urged the government to intervene, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has declined to force both sides into arbitration.


CN said it was waiting for a response on one final offer made late Wednesday when it locked the workers out. CPKC spokesperson Patrick Waldron said the union rejected its last offer that CEO Keith Creel made at the table in person. Both railroads have said they would end the lockout if the union agreed to binding arbitration.


“Despite the lockout, the Teamsters remain at the bargaining table with both companies,” the union said in a statement.


CN had been negotiating with the Teamsters for nine months while CPKC had been trying to reach an agreement for a year, the unions said.


Many companies across all industries rely on railroads to deliver their raw materials and finished products, so without regular rail service they may have to cut back or even close.


That’s why the U.S. government kept rail workers from going on strike two years ago and forced them to accept a contract despite their concerns about demanding schedules and the lack of paid sick time.


Canada’s railroads have sometimes shut down briefly in the past during contract negotiations — most recently CPKC was offline for a couple of days in March 2022 — but it is rare for both railroads to stop at the same time. The impact on businesses will be magnified because both CN and CPKC have stopped.


Both CN and CPKC had been gradually shutting down since last week ahead of the contract deadline. Shipments of hazardous chemicals and perishable goods were the first to stop, so they wouldn't be stranded somewhere on the tracks.


As the Canadian contract talks were coming down to the wire, one of the biggest U.S. railroads, CSX, broke with the U.S. freight rail industry’s longstanding practice of negotiating jointly for years with the unions. CSX reached a deal with several of its 13 unions that cover 25% of its workers ahead of the start of national bargaining later this year.


The new five-year contracts will provide 17.5% raises, better benefits and vacation time if they are ratified. The unions that have signed deals with CSX include part of the SMART-TD union representing conductors in one region, the Transportation Communications Union, the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen and the Transport Workers Union. TCU President Artie Maratea said he’s proud that his union reached a deal “without years of unnecessary delay and stall tactics.”


Trudeau has been reluctant to force arbitration because he doesn't want to offend the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference and other unions, but he urged both sides to reach a deal Wednesday because of the tremendous economic damage that would follow a full shutdown.


“It is in the best interest of both sides to continue doing the hard work at the table," Trudeau said to reporters in Gatineau, Quebec. “Millions of Canadians, workers, farmers, businesses, right across the country, are counting on both sides to do the work and get to a resolution.”


Numerous business groups have been urging Trudeau to act.


Trudeau said Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon met with both sides in the CN talks in Montreal on Tuesday and would be on hand for the CPKC talks in Calgary, Alberta. MacKinnon later said he wrapped up his meetings with the rail companies and the Teamsters.


'Workers, farmers, commuters and businesses can’t wait. Canadians need urgency at the table. The parties need to get deals done now," he posted on the social platform X.


The negotiations are stuck on issues related to the way rail workers are scheduled and concerns about rules designed to prevent fatigue and provide adequate rest to train crews. Both railroads had proposed shifting away from the existing system, which pays workers based on the miles in a trip, to an hourly system they said would make it easier to provide predictable time off.


The railroads said their contract offers have included raises consistent with recent deals in the industry. Engineers make about $150,000 a year on Canadian National while conductors earn $120,000, and CPKC says its wages are comparable.


Similar quality-of-life concerns about demanding schedules and the lack of paid sick time nearly led to a U.S. rail strike two years ago until Congress and President Joe Biden intervened and forced the unions to accept a deal.


Manufacturing companies may have to scale back or even shut down production if they can't get rail service, while ports and grain elevators will quickly become clogged with shipments waiting to move. And if the dispute drags on for a couple weeks, water treatment plants all across Canada might have to scramble without new shipments of chlorine.


Some companies would undoubtedly turn to trucking to keep some of their products moving, but there's no way to make up for the volume railroads deliver. It would take some 300 trucks to haul everything just one train can carry.

## Harris' running mate, Tim Walz, introduces himself to the nation

date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO  — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted his party's nomination for vice president Wednesday night, using his Democratic National Convention address to thank the packed arena for "bringing the joy" to an election transformed by the elevation of his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris.


"We're all here tonight for one beautiful, simple, reason: We love this country," Walz said as thousands of delegates hoisted vertical placards reading "Coach Walz" in red, white and blue.


Walz described his upbringing in Nebraska and teaching and coaching football in Minnesota and told the crowd, "Thank you for bringing the joy to this fight."


"While other states were banning books from their schools, we were banishing hunger from ours," he said. In a dig at his Republican counterpart, JD Vance, he added, "I had 24 kids in my high school class, and none of them went to Yale."


When Walz talked about the difficulty conceiving his daughter, Hope, she made a heart with her hands and held it over her chest. His son, Gus, wept watching his dad speak and at least once shouted, "That's my dad!"


"I haven't given a lot of speeches like this, but I've given a lot of pep talks," Walz said.


Democrats gathered at Chicago's United Center are hoping to build on the momentum Harris has brought since taking over the top of the party's presidential ticket last month. They want to harness the Democratic exuberance that followed President Joe Biden stepping aside while also making clear to their supporters that they face a fierce battle with former President Donald Trump.


Many Americans had never heard of Walz until Harris made him her running mate. In his first weeks of campaigning, he's charmed supporters with his background and helped to balance Harris' coastal background as a cultural representative of Midwestern states whose voters she needs this fall.


But Walz also has faced scrutiny, including questions about embellishing his background. His wife this week clarified that she did not undergo in vitro fertilization, as Walz has repeatedly claimed, but used other fertility treatments. Republicans also have criticized Walz for a 2018 comment he made about carrying weapons in war. Though he served in the National Guard for 24 years, he did not deploy to a war zone.


Benjamin C. Ingman, one of Walz's old high school students, introduced the man many speakers — and Harris at times — have referred to as "Coach Walz." At Ingman's prompting, many of Walz's former players decked out in their red and white jerseys took the stage to help introduce him.


The Bill and Oprah show


Walz's speech followed former President Bill Clinton who returned to a place he knows well, the Democratic National Convention stage, to denounce Donald Trump as selfish and praise Kamala Harris as focused on the needs of Americans — firing up his party with his trademark off-the-cuff flourishes.


Clinton was meant to add heft to a third DNC night headlined by vice presidential nominee Tim Walz 's introduction to a national audience.


"We've got a pretty clear choice it seems to me. Kamala Harris, for the people. And the other guy who has proved, even more than the first go-around, that he's about me, myself and I," Clinton said.


The nation's 42nd president and a veteran of his party's political convention going back decades, Clinton was once declared the "secretary of explaining stuff" by Barack Obama, whose reelection bid in 2012 was bolstered by a Clinton stemwinder at that year's DNC.


Now 78 — the same age as Trump — Clinton's delivery was sometimes halting, his movements slower and he mispronounced Harris' first name twice. His left hand often shook when he wasn't using it to grip the lectern.


Still, he delivered several memorable, homespun pronouncements including asking. "What does her opponent do with his voice? He mostly talks about himself. So the next time you hear him, don't count the lies, count the I's."


Oprah Winfrey, who long hosted her signature TV talk show from Chicago, picked up on one of Democrats' favorite themes of late, scoffing at Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance having once derided "childless cat ladies" as he argued that Americans should be having more children.


Winfrey said that if a burning house belonged to a "childless cat lady," neighbors would still help and "try to get that cat out, too."


"We are beyond ridiculous tweets and lies and foolery," she said of Trump, before referencing a recent comment he made to supporters about only having to vote once more — for him — and never again.


"You're looking at a registered independent who's proud to vote again and again and again, because that's what Americans do," she said. "Voting is the best of America."


A focus on 'freedoms'


The night's theme was "a fight for our freedoms," with the programming focusing on abortion access and other rights that Democrats want to center in their campaign against Trump. Speaker after speaker argued that their party wants to defend freedoms while Republicans want to take them away.


Colorado Gov. Jared Polis used a prop that has become a convention staple, an oversized book meant to represent the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, a sweeping set of goals to shrink government and push it to the right, if Trump wins. Polis even ripped a page from the ceremonial volume and said he was going to keep it and show it to undecided voters.


The former president has distanced himself from Project 2025, but its key authors include his former top advisers. His running mate, JD Vance, wrote the foreword for the Heritage Foundation CEO's new book.


Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told the story of a woman in her state, which enacted new abortion restrictions after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, who was forced to carry to term a child with a fatal illness, only to watch the newborn die just hours after birth.


Dana Nessel, Michigan's attorney general and an openly gay woman, declared, "I got a message for the Republicans and the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court: You can pry this wedding band from my cold, dead, gay hand."


Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi spoke about the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He chaired a congressional committee that investigated the mob overrunning the Capitol, saying, "They wanted to stop the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in American history."


"Thank God they failed," Thompson said.


Trump bashed the convention as a "charade" and noted the fact that he has been a frequent topic of conversation. He also singled out his predecessor, Obama, for a highly critical convention speech Tuesday night, saying Obama had been "nasty."


A recognition of the Oct. 7 hostages


Democrats recognized the hostages still being held by Hamas after its October 7 attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Jon and Rachel Goldberg-Polin brought some in the arena to tears as they paid tribute to their son Hersh, who was abducted in the attack.


Freeing hostages "is not a political issue. It is a humanitarian issue," Jon Goldberg-Polin said, adding that "in a competition of pain there are no winners."


The Israel-Hamas war has split the Democratic base, with pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrating outside the United Center and several speakers this week acknowledging civilian deaths in the Israeli offensive in Gaza. More than 40,000 people have died in Gaza, according to local health authorities.

## Mexico to charge drug lord for delivering another drug lord to US

date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA

MEXICO CITY  — The strange saga of how two Mexican drug lords were detained after landing in a plane in the United States in July just got stranger.


The Mexican government now says it is bringing charges against Joaquín Guzmán López, but not because he was a leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel founded by his father, Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán.


Instead, Mexican prosecutors are bringing charges against the younger Guzmán for apparently kidnapping Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada — an older drug boss from a rival faction of the cartel — forcing him onto the plane and flying to an airport near El Paso, Texas.


The younger Guzmán apparently intended to turn himself in to U.S. authorities, but may have brought Zambada along as a prize to sweeten any plea deal.


Federal prosecutors issued a statement saying "an arrest warrant has been prepared" against the younger Guzmán for kidnapping.


But it also cited another charge under an article of Mexico's criminal code that defines what he did as treason. That section of the law says treason is committed "by those who illegally abduct a person in Mexico in order to hand them over to authorities of another country."


That clause was apparently motivated by the abduction of a Mexican doctor wanted for allegedly participating in the 1985 torture and killing of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Kiki Camarena.


Nowhere in the statement does it mention that the younger Guzmán was a member of the "little Chapos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, made up of Chapo's sons, that smuggles millions of doses of the deadly opioid fentanyl into the United States, causing about 70,000 overdose deaths each year.


The federal prosecutors' statement also included an unusually harsh and revealing description about evidence presented by prosecutors in the northern state of Sinaloa that has since proved to be false.


Sinaloa state prosecutors were apparently trying to distance the state's governor, Rubén Rocha, from the killing of a local political rival, Hector Cuén, who was at a meeting that was used as a pretext for luring Zambada to the abduction site. Zambada has said he expected the governor to be at that meeting; Rocha has said he made a trip out of the state that day.


To play down reports of the purported meeting, state prosecutors published a video of an apparent shooting during what they claimed was a botched robbery at a local gas station. They said Cuén was killed there, not at the meeting site, where Zambada said Cuén was murdered.


While federal prosecutors stopped short of saying the gas station video was a fake, they earlier noted that the number of gunshots heard on the video didn't match the number of gunshot wounds on Cuén's body.


On Wednesday, the federal prosecutors went further, saying the video "is unacceptable, nor does it have sufficient value as evidence to be taken into account."


Zambada has said that Guzmán, whom he trusted, had invited him to the meeting to help iron out the fierce political rivalry between Cuén and Rocha. Zambada was known for eluding capture for decades because of his incredibly tight, loyal and sophisticated personal security apparatus.


The fact that he would knowingly leave that all behind to meet with Rocha means that Zambada viewed such a meeting as credible and feasible. The same goes for the idea that Zambada, as the leader of the oldest wing of the Sinaloa cartel, could act as an arbiter in the state's political disputes.


The governor has denied he knew of or attended the meeting where Zambada was abducted.

## Pro-Palestinian protesters rally, march on Democratic convention's 3rd night

date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO  — More than 2,000 pro-Palestinian protesters marched Wednesday past a park where pro-Israel demonstrators had gathered earlier and toward the arena hosting the third night of the Democratic National Convention.


The demonstration, which stayed largely peaceful, came a day after violent clashes between police and protesters led to 56 arrests at a much smaller unsanctioned protest outside the Israeli Consulate.


Organizers of Wednesday's demonstration drew on the Chicago area's Palestinian community, one of the largest in the country, by bringing buses from suburban mosques.


Raed Shuk, 48, came with his children from the suburbs, including his 2-year-old son, who sat on Shuk's shoulders ahead of the march. Shuk, whose parents are Palestinian, said they have come to so many rallies that his son knows the chants by heart.


"Everybody's humanity needs to be equally addressed here and there," he said of Gaza. "I want to help my children learn from this experience that you always like to stand up for your rights and always peacefully protest."


The march, one of the largest anticipated demonstrations of the week, took on a festive tone at times as a drum line led marchers and a sea of Palestinian flags waved above the crowds. Some kids ate popsicles as they walked, and others were pushed in strollers or rode in wagons.


The crowd stopped outside a park that is roughly a block from the United Center and used megaphones and air horns to call out elected leaders, including Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, for being "complicit" in the war in Gaza. The two-term Democrat, who was under consideration as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, criticized a cease-fire resolution Chicago approved in January.


The crowds of pro-Palestinian protesters included many families and people of different faiths. Small groups of Muslims gathered in prayer at a park just ahead of the march's kickoff, using keffiyeh as prayer rugs. Rabbis were among the leaders of the march, and a small group marched through in the crowd holding a sign that said, "Christians for Ceasefire."


Rabbi Brant Rosen, a founder of the Jewish Voice for Peace Rabbinical Council, condemned Democrats for not speaking out about the war in Gaza at the convention.


"The word Palestine is not allowed inside the Democratic National Convention. The word cease-fire has barely been uttered," he said. "This is a Hollywood-style coronation of a candidate. They assume they are entitled to our votes, but they are not entitled to our votes."




Earlier in the day, police escorted pro-Israel demonstrators out of a park near the United Center as the area was blocked off ahead of the march of activists heading there.


The rally near the United Center was organized by the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, a Palestinian and Arab community-based organization. It was in stark contrast to the protest Tuesday night outside the Israeli Consulate. Protesters not affiliated with a coalition of more than 200 groups that have the city's permission for demonstrations ended up in an intense standoff with Chicago police.


Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said those arrested Tuesday night outside the Israeli Consulate, about 3.2 kilometers from the United Center, "showed up with the intention of committing acts of violence, vandalism." Snelling called the police response "proportionate."


Thirty of the people detained by police were issued citations for disorderly conduct, according to Chicago police. One person was arrested on a felony charge of resisting police, while nine were charged with misdemeanors including disorderly conduct, resisting officers, battery, assault and criminal damage to property, police said.


Snelling said that two people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, one for knee pain and one with a finger injury. Two officers were injured, but they refused medical attention because they did not want to leave fellow officers, Snelling said. He said three journalists were among those arrested, but he did not have details on charges.


Hatem Abudayyeh, co-founder of the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, put the onus on police to keep the peace when asked about the clashes between pro-Palestinian protesters and police. The police "only have one responsibility here," he said. "They have the responsibility of not infringing on our First Amendment rights."


The Israeli Consulate has been the site of numerous demonstrations since the war in Gaza began in October, and protests during the DNC have largely focused on opposing the Israel-Hamas war.


The largest protest so far, which attracted about 3,500 people on Monday, was largely peaceful and resulted in 13 arrests, most related to a breach of security fencing. Two were arrested Sunday night during another mostly peaceful march.

## California announces new deal with tech to fund journalism, AI research

date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA

SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California will be the first U.S. state to direct millions of dollars from taxpayer money and tech companies to help pay for journalism and AI research under a new deal announced Wednesday.


Under the first-in-the-nation agreement, the state and tech companies would collectively pay roughly $250 million over five years to support California-based news organization and create an AI research program. The initiatives are set to kick in in 2025 with $100 million the first year, and the majority of the money would go to news organizations, said Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, who brokered the deal.


"This agreement represents a major breakthrough in ensuring the survival of newsrooms and bolstering local journalism across California — leveraging substantial tech industry resources without imposing new taxes on Californians," Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. "The deal not only provides funding to support hundreds of new journalists but helps rebuild a robust and dynamic California press corps for years to come, reinforcing the vital role of journalism in our democracy."


Wicks' office didn't immediately answer questions about specifics on how much funding would come from the state, which news organizations would be eligible and how much money would go to the AI research program.


The deal effectively marks the end of a yearlong fight between tech giants and lawmakers over Wicks' proposal to require companies like Google, Facebook and Microsoft to pay a certain percentage of advertising revenue to media companies for linking to their content.


The bill, modelled after a legislation in Canada aiming at providing financial help to local news organizations, faced intense backlash from the tech industry, which launched ads over the summer to attack the bill. Google also tried to pressure lawmakers to drop the bill by temporarily removing news websites from some people's search results in April.


"This partnership represents a cross-sector commitment to supporting a free and vibrant press, empowering local news outlets up and down the state to continue in their essential work," Wicks said in a statement. "This is just the beginning."


California has tried different ways to stop the loss of journalism jobs, which have been disappearing rapidly as legacy media companies have struggled to profit in the digital age. More than 2,500 newspapers have closed in the U.S. since 2005, according to Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. California has lost more than 100 news organizations in the past decade, according to Wicks' office.


The Wednesday agreement is supported by California News Publishers Association, which represents more than 700 news organizations, Google's corporate parent Alphabet and OpenAI. But journalists, including those in Media Guild of the West, slammed the deal and said it would hurt California news organizations.


State Sen. Steve Glazer, who authored a bill to provide news organizations a tax credit for hiring full-time journalists, said the agreement "seriously undercuts our work toward a long-term solution to rescue independent journalism."


State Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire also said the deal doesn't go far enough to address the dire situation in California.


"Newsrooms have been hollowed out across this state while tech platforms have seen multi-billion-dollar profits," he said in a statement. "We have concerns that this proposal lacks sufficient funding for newspapers and local media and doesn't fully address the inequities facing the industry."

## Senior US officials meet Dalai Lama in New York

date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA

washington — Senior US officials met with the Dalai Lama in New York on Wednesday, according to the State Department, in a rare high-level direct meeting between Washington and the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. 


The Dalai Lama, who is denounced by Beijing as a separatist, met with senior State Department official Uzra Zeya and White House National Security Council official Kelly Razzouk in New York, where he is visiting to receive medical treatment.  


During the meeting, Zeya "reaffirmed the US commitment to advancing the human rights of Tibetans and supporting efforts to preserve their distinct historical, linguistic, cultural, and religious heritage." 


Beijing imposes strict controls on Tibet, which it considers an inalienable part of its territory, and denounces the Dalai Lama -- who advocates for greater Tibetan autonomy -- as a rebel.  


During the meeting on Wednesday, Zeya also discussed US "support for resuming dialogue between the PRC and His Holiness and his representatives," the statement said, using an abbreviation for the People's Republic of China. 


Talks between Beijing and Tibetan leaders have been frozen since 2010. 


Beijing on Thursday condemned the meeting, accusing the Dalai Lama of being "a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities under the guise of religion." 


"China firmly opposes any country allowing the Dalai Lama to visit under any pretext and strongly opposes any form of meetings between government officials of any country and the Dalai Lama," foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. 


Beijing had "lodged a strong protest" with Washington, she added. 


The Dalai Lama, 89, received knee surgery in New York this year, and said he was recovering well in a statement released in July.  


He stepped down as his people's political head in 2011, passing the baton of secular power to a government chosen democratically by some 130,000 Tibetans around the world. 


In July, China sanctioned a US lawmaker for "interference" over his support for Tibetans, a month after the US Congress passed a law strengthening support for Tibet and senior US lawmakers met with the Dalai Lama in India.  


China took control of Tibet in 1951, and the Dalai Lama fled into exile in 1959. 


Tibet had previously been largely autonomous following the fall of the Qing dynasty, which lasted three centuries.

## New York man accused of spying on Chinese dissidents, DOJ says

date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A New York man was charged on Wednesday with operating as an illegal agent of the Chinese government in the United States, accusing him of spying on Chinese pro-Democracy activists and dissidents, the Justice Department said.


The DOJ alleges that Yuanjun Tang, 67, acted as a Chinese agent between 2018 and 2023 at the direction of China's Ministry of State Security, its principal intelligence agency.


Tang gave to MSS intelligence officers information about individuals and groups viewed by China "as potentially adverse" to its interests, including prominent U.S.-based Chinese dissidents, the DOJ said.


He helped MSS infiltrate a group chat on an encrypted messaging application used by numerous Chinese dissidents, the DOJ said.


Tang is also accused of making false statements to the FBI when he claimed he was no longer able to access an email account used to communicate with his MSS handler, the department said.


Tang is a former Chinese citizen who was imprisoned for his activities as a dissident, according to the department. He was granted political asylum in the U.S. and later became a citizen.


The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters was unable to contact Tang.

## Attorney for far-right Oath Keepers group pleads guilty to Capitol riot charges

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — An attorney who represented the far-right Oath Keepers pleaded guilty on Wednesday to charges stemming from a mob's Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including members of the extremist group. 


Kellye SoRelle, who was general counsel for the anti-government group and a close associate of its founder, is scheduled to be sentenced on January 17 by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C. 


SoRelle, 45, of Granbury, Texas, answered routine questions by the judge as she pleaded guilty to two charges: a felony count of obstructing justice and a misdemeanor count of entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds. The felony carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, but her estimated sentencing guidelines recommend a maximum of 16 months behind bars. 


SoRelle was arrested in Junction, Texas, in September 2022. Her case remained suspended for months amid questions about her mental health. 


More than a year ago, medical experts concluded that SoRelle was mentally incompetent to stand trial. In November 2023, she reported to a federal Bureau of Prisons facility for treatment. Last month, Mehta ruled that SoRelle had recovered to an extent that she could understand the nature of her charges and could assist in her defense. 


Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes is serving an 18-year prison sentence for orchestrating a plot to keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 presidential election. After Rhodes' arrest, SoRelle told media outlets she was acting as the president of the Oath Keepers in his absence. 




SoRelle, a former Texas prosecutor, was photographed with Rhodes outside the Capitol on January 6. As the riot erupted, she posted a chat message for other Oath Keepers that said, “We are acting like the founding fathers — can’t stand down. Per Stewart, and I concur.” 


“Although SoRelle did not personally enter the Capitol Building on January 6, she understood the role those inside and outside the building, like herself, played in delaying the certification proceeding that had been taking place inside the Capitol,” said a court filing accompanying her guilty plea. 


The night before the riot, she joined Rhodes in meeting with other extremist group members in an underground garage in Washington, D.C. The meeting also included former Proud Boys national leader Enrique Tarrio, who is serving a 22-year prison sentence for his role in a separate plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden after the election. 


Rhodes, a former U.S. Army paratrooper, founded the Oath Keepers in 2009. The group recruits current and former military, police and first responders and pledges to “fulfill the oath all military and police take to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” 


During the trial for Rhodes and other Oath Keepers charged with seditious conspiracy, jurors heard testimony that SoRelle had a romantic relationship with Rhodes. 


SoRelle pleaded guilty to obstructing justice for encouraging others to destroy electronic evidence of their participation in the plot. Two days after the riot, Rhodes and SoRelle both sent messages from her cellphone encouraging Oath Keepers to delete any incriminating evidence. 


She was indicted on other charges, including conspiring with Rhodes and other Oath Keepers to obstruct Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote. But she did not plead guilty to the conspiracy charge. 


Also on Wednesday, a judge set a February 3 trial date for an Illinois man charged with firing a gun during the riot. John Banuelos climbed scaffolding outside the Capitol, took out his revolver and fired two shots into the air, according to prosecutors. 


Banuelos, of Summit, Illinois, was arrested in March. U.S. District Judge Judge Tanya Chutkan refused on Wednesday to free Banuelos from pretrial custody. She ruled that he poses a flight risk and a danger to the public. 


“It could have been much more tragic,” the judge said of the gunshots.

## US official holds talks in Africa on responsible use of military AI

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

Abuja, Nigeria — A U.S. State Department official was in Nigeria this week to meet with local and regional authorities about the responsible use of artificial intelligence in military applications.


Mallory Stewart, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability, said her two-day visit with Nigerian officials from the regional bloc ECOWAS was part of the United States’ commitment to deepen security cooperation in Africa.


The U.S. government has been working with 55 nations, including African nations, “to agree upon responsible uses of AI in the military context, using AI in a manner consistent with international laws [and] recognizing inherent human bias,” Stewart told journalists Wednesday.




“We've learned the hard way [that there is] inherent human bias built into the AI system ... leading to maybe misinformation being provided to the decisionmaker,” she said.


The goal, she continued, "is to hear from as many countries as possible that are at the stage of working in artificial intelligence to their military to see how we can minimize the risks."


Last year, the Global Terrorism Index report named sub-Saharan Africa an epicenter of terrorism, accounting for nearly 60% of terror-related deaths. It is unclear whether the terror groups are using AI.


Nigerian authorities have been pushing for the integration of artificial intelligence in military operations, while acknowledging that adopting AI will require Africa-specific policies.


Security analyst Kabiru Adamu of Beacon Consulting said the use of AI in military operations has advantages.


"Given the position of the U.S. in terms of its military capacity and technological advancement, it will definitely be in the position to support Nigeria's desires, especially if it's able to contextualize some of the peculiarities within the Nigerian security space,” Adamu said. “We can't isolate ourselves from the international committee of nations. AI is embedded in security, so we have to do it. But we need to be cognizant of the supporting infrastructure for good technology. Power is one of them, culture."


The founder of Global Sentinel online magazine, Senator Iroegbu, said that while AI has benefits, the technology still needs to be treated with caution.


"It limits casualties in terms of the number of soldiers that will be deployed, so you conserve your boots,” Iroegbu said. “It helps penetrate rough terrains, gather more intelligence. It's good that there's growing awareness of the issue of artificial intelligence, but Nigeria needs to first of all try to define its own policy and strategy with regards to artificial intelligence. More sensitization needs to be done, and more policy aspect of it needs to be developed.”


In June, African ministers unanimously endorsed landmark continental AI strategy to advance Africa's digital future and development aspirations. And last week, the African Union approved the adoption of AI in public and private sectors in member states, including Nigeria.

## Microsoft update breaks GRUB on dual-boot systems

date: 2024-08-21, from: OS News

Ah, secure boot, the bane of many running anything other than Windows. While it&#8217;s already been found to be utterly useless by now, it&#8217;s still a requirement for Windows 11, and ever since it became part of PCs about a decade or so ago, it&#8217;s been causing headaches for people who don&#8217;t use Windows. Yesterday, Microsoft released a patch for a two-year-old vulnerability in the GRUB bootloader, and while the company claimed it would only be installed on single-boot Windows machines, that clearly wasn&#8217;t the case as right after its release, people dual-booting Linux and Windows found their Linux installations unbootable. Tuesday’s update left dual-boot devices—meaning those configured to run both Windows and Linux—no longer able to boot into the latter when Secure Boot was enforced. When users tried to load Linux, they received the message: “Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation. Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security Policy Violation.” Almost immediately support and discussion forums lit up with ​​reports of the failure. ↫ Dan Goodin at Ars Technica The fix is both easy and hilarious: disable secure boot, and you&#8217;re good to go. You can also get a bit more technical and remove the SBAT installed by this update, but while that will allow you to keep booting with secure boot enabled, it will leave you vulnerable to the issue the SBAT was supposed to fix. The efficacy of secure boot in home environments is debatable, at best, and while I&#8217;m not going to advise anyone to just turn it off and forget about it, I think most OSNews readers can make an informed decision about secure boot by themselves. If you&#8217;re using corporate machines managed by your employer&#8217;s IT department, you obviously need to refer to them. Microsoft itself has not yet commented on this issue, and is not responding to questions from press outlets, so we&#8217;re currently in the dark about how such a game-breaking update got out in the wild. Regardless, this once again shows just how annoying secure boot is. In many cases, the boot problems people trying out Linux run into caused by secure boot, but of course, the blame is placed squarely on Linux, and not on secure boot itself being a hot mess.

## Ford’s Big Blow to the EV Transition

date: 2024-08-21, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzUwNDU3OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NTgyNjI0NX0.3_G0-4bQgi8hOz3UwSfQseSE_AkdZSPm2pxWcAotpM8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C203%2C0%2C219"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Well, that’s not good. </p><p>Ford Motor Company is canceling one of its most anticipated electric vehicles and delaying another EV project. The changes will cost at least $400 million — and as much as $1.9 billion — the company said Wednesday, and they signal that one of the biggest players in the American car industry still hasn’t yet found a workable EV strategy. With these new delays, the North American car market may not see the explosive growth of EV options — the kind of efflorescence already happening in Europe and China — until the end of this decade.</p><p>The primary car in question is Ford’s planned three-row EV crossover, possibly its most anticipated EV model. The new car, which was originally slated for release in 2023 before being bumped to 2025, will now be produced only as a hybrid. That fits in with Ford’s recent <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ford-maverick-hybrid-q1-sales" target="_self"><u>embrace of hybrids</u></a> — by 2030, the company now says, it will <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2024/04/04/ford-delays-ev-launches-hybrid-lineup-2030/73201263007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offer a hybrid version</u></a> of each vehicle in its line-up — but it deals a substantial blow to the company’s future EV offerings. Ford also announced that it will delay the release of a new medium-sized electric pickup truck to 2027. That truck, so far known only as “T3,” is meant to be the first product of the company’s California-based skunkworks staffed by Tesla alumni. That team is meant to help Ford develop a low-cost, globally competitive <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/730922/ford-skunkworks-ev-midsize-compact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electric vehicle platform</u></a> that could eventually undergird crossovers, trucks, and commercial vehicles.</p><p>Taken together, these changes mean that the company will offer no new electric vehicles in the consumer market for the next two years. Yes, the company’s outlook for EVs in the commercial market is a little brighter — Ford will begin selling an all-electric commercial van in 2026. But to entice the average buyer it will have to rely entirely on existing models — the Mustang Mach E and F-150 Lightning — to generate EV sales. The company will also cut back a quarter of its planned EV spending. It’s not an overstatement to say that Ford seems to be giving up on the consumer side of the EV transition until the back half of the decade. </p><p>“Ford has some improvements coming in 2026, but they’re basically throwing their hands up on the market,” Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at the market research firm BloombergNEF, told me. “They’re essentially ceding ground to other automakers in the U.S. market, and there’s a clear lack of plan for how they plan to stay competitive.</p><p>“There’s no way you can say it’s a good thing for the U.S. EV market,” he added.</p><p>Executives blamed the shifts on persistent challenges turning a profit in its EV unit, which has hemorrhaged money as it has spun up production, ultimately losing <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a60621256/ford-ev-revenue-losses-q1-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$130,000 on every EV</u></a> that it sold during the first quarter of 2024. </p><p>“These vehicles need to be profitable, and if they’re not profitable based on where the customer is and the market is, we will ... make those tough decisions,” John Lawler, Ford’s chief financial officer, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1f6633f2-a813-4e47-9276-ef191af01f05" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told the </u><u><em><em>Financial Times</em></em></u></a>. The company could not figure out how to reconcile the cost of the large battery needed for the three-row SUV with the vehicle’s size and price in a way that could turn a profit within 12 months, he <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/730891/ford-three-row-electric-suv-dead/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>added</u></a>. </p><p>Ford’s approach may reflect a canny understanding of consumer demand in the American market. Although EVs are far better for the climate than gasoline-burning vehicles, hybrids pollute <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/24/1158306767/prius-toyota-hybrids-electric-car-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>somewhat less</u></a> than conventional gas guzzlers. Over the past few years, as new EV models have trickled into the market, hybrid sales <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hybrid-sales-south-fork-wind" target="_self"><u>have boomed</u></a>, and that is, all things considered, a good thing: Replacing America’s fleet of gasoline-burning SUVs and crossovers with a hybrid fleet will still work to reduce emissions, although it will not allow for the extremely rapid emissions reductions that could keep the 1.5 degree Celsius warming goal in sight. </p><p>More pertinently, perhaps, the shift also creates a strategic opening in the American EV market. Tesla has long dominated U.S. market share, and in the past few years, Ford has settled into a comfortable No. 2 position. But Tesla <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-12-q1-ev-sales" target="_self"><u>has</u></a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-2" target="_self"><u>struggled</u></a> with its own dearth of new models: Except for the luxury Cybertruck, the automaker has no new cars or trucks in its pipeline. And now that Ford appears to be taking a step back, the combined effect could create an opening for other automakers — namely <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hyundai-motor-group-kia-motors-ioniq-5-ev-6" target="_self"><u>Hyundai, Kia</u></a>, or the startup <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-earnings-r2-release" target="_self"><u>Rivian</u></a> — to step into the breach in 2025 and 2026. If Ford’s timeline holds, for instance, then Rivian will begin selling its widely awaited $45,000 R2 crossover in 2026, a year before Ford can offer anything new.</p><p>The shift also vindicates decision making at Ford’s cross-town competitor, General Motors. While Ford sought to take an early lead by manufacturing a few buzzy standalone EV models (like the Mach E), GM has focused on developing a robust EV platform, the Ultium. Although its initial Ultium-based releases had big deficiencies, its latest cars look better, and the platform should allow it to begin manufacturing a diverse lineup of cars and trucks in a relatively brief period of time. “For all the knocking we did of GM, their thinking makes sense: First you spin battery manufacturing up, then you put it in a lot of models, then you find out which models work” in the broader market, Cantor told me.</p><p>But perhaps the change in plans is most ominous for Ford’s cost model: If it can’t get a three-row crossover to pencil out, how can it get <em><em>any </em></em>kind of non-F-150 to work financially? Despite Ford’s struggles to make its three-row SUV concept work, other companies have already brought their own three-row electric vehicles to market. At the high end, Rivian’s R1T has three rows, starts at $69,000, and is the company’s best-selling vehicle. But Kia’s three-row EV9 starts at about $55,000 before subsidies, and Hyundai is due to start selling its own three-row SUV, the Ioniq 9, later this year. Other companies have found a way to make EVs without breaking the bank. Why hasn’t Ford? </p><p>But if Ford and GM’s behavior makes more sense for the wealthier and more cautious American consumer — in a country where public fast charger installation is still lagging — then it indicates, too, just how much America has fallen behind other global auto markets. On the same day that Ford backed off its multi-year EV goals, the Chinese tech giant Xiaomi <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d12e66d2-e548-4a85-a207-7ddb6ab2ac2a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> that it had already beaten its annual target for EV sales and turned a profit while doing it<em><em>. </em></em>Xiaomi, BYD, and other Chinese automakers are rushing into the EV market, seemingly capable of producing more EVs, more cheaply and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/business/byd-profit-soar-after-beats-tesla/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>profitably</u></a>, than their American competitors. Ford’s retrenchment into gas cars means that it has now fallen even further behind the global standard.</p>

Speaking of Michelle Obama, she made the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-whos-going-to-tell-trump-that-hes-campaigning-for-a-black-job-michelle-obama-asks">most powerful political statement</a> I've ever heard. "Who's going to tell Trump the job he's currently seeking might just be one of those black jobs." The way she said it made you think. Here we are, and one way or another, we <i>have</i> changed. America in 2024 is vastly different from the American of 2008. America is moving both toward self-acceptance and away from it at the same time. But here in the half of America my feet are planted in, we realize that there isn't a black America and a white America, there's just one America. We finally have come to accept ourselves as we have been all along.

If a few of my users were geeks and visionaries, they could start telling other vendors they should hook up to my source lists, so they can use Pocketcasts to subscribe. One place to subscribe is way better than many. If you think things like that can't happen, think again. How did you all come to use <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> for your subscription lists? It's because someone volunteered to go first, and the users of that product demanded that other products support the format.

When I was looking to crop a landscape photo into a panorama, I discovered an app called Series. It’s a collage application that divides images for posting on Threads, Instagram’s microblogging platform. You can also use it to produce photos in sizes suitable for Twitter, Instagram, or other social media sites.  On Threads, users can create a photo carousel. However, when images are precisely divided, users can reconstruct a complete wide-angle view that fills the screen. The panoramic effect becomes apparent as users move through the photos, producing &#8230;

## US Pacific territories near status upgrade at islands summit

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Two U.S. Pacific territories are moving closer to a status upgrade from observer to associate member, elevating their status within the region's political and economic policy organization, the Pacific Islands Forum.


The PIF leaders' meeting is set to open Monday in Tonga’s capital, Nuku'alofa.


Tongan Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni has confirmed there will be a vote on new associate members. “Guam and American Samoa have applied,” he told ABC Pacific recently. “We’ll be actually tabling a paper for the leaders to consider.”


Foreign ministers from the Pacific bloc reviewed the applications for associate member status from the two U.S. territories during their meeting on August 9. Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown noted that there is "widespread support" for the applications.


On Tuesday, forum leaders will engage in talks with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, associate members and forum observers. A senior State Department official will represent the United States.


The Pacific Islands Forum has 18 member states, with Australia and New Zealand being the largest economies in the bloc. Neither the United States nor China is a full member, but both countries are dialogue partners.


U.S. greenlights


Until recently, U.S. Pacific territories Guam, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands held observer status for the forum.


In June, however, the U.S. government eased restrictions, allowing these territories to join the PIF as nonvoting associate members, provided they do not take foreign policy positions. This change modified a longstanding policy that had previously barred their participation in international organizations.




Although the French territories of French Polynesia and New Caledonia have become full PIF members, analysts currently do not anticipate that U.S. Pacific territories will be approved for full membership soon.


“It would be a bit like Nebraska voting at the United Nations,” Cleo Paskal, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told VOA.


“The degree to which constituent parts of the U.S., such as Guam and American Samoa, can participate as full members in multilateral organizations is complex,” she said. “On one hand, the people of those islands understandably want to be represented in a forum that claims to speak for the region. On the other, they can't legally sign up to foreign policy positions for the U.S.”


U.S.-PIF summit


A State Department spokesperson told VOA that the United States has made broader and deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands a key priority of its foreign policy.


The spokesperson cited the U.S.-hosted summit meetings with Pacific Island leaders in Washington in September 2022 and 2023.




But neither the White House nor the State Department would confirm whether a third U.S.-Pacific Island Forum summit will take place this year.


In recent years, U.S. policymakers have recognized that U.S. presence and influence in the Pacific cannot be taken for granted, especially in the face of increased Chinese interest and engagement in the region, according to Kathryn Paik, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.


Paik recently wrote in a CSIS publication that Washington’s realization has led to a series of high-level visits, the opening of several new embassies, the return of the Peace Corps to the region, and numerous financial initiatives across the fisheries, health, law enforcement and economic sectors.

## The FTC’s noncompete agreements ban has been struck down

The ruling prevents the FTC’s ban on noncompete agreements from taking effect on September 4th, though the agency could still appeal the decision."</p></blockquote><p>This is such a blow. Non-competes are already illegal in California; they're inherently anti-worker and are also very clearly a hindrance to innovation.</p><p>Hopefully the FTC appeals. The judge's argument that it would cause "irreparable harm" is nonsense: any business that has to protect itself by not allowing its workforce to go work for a competitor is obviously not competitive at what it does. Instead, businesses should seek to do good work and create conditions so that workers <em>don't want to leave in the first place</em>. The solution is a better workplace, not legal restrictions that prevent people from finding a different employer.</p>

## Using AI to feed my toddler on a road trip

date: 2024-08-21, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p><img src="https://werd.io/file/66c5ebf0694c76b14d007b42/thumb.jpg" alt="Intersecting freeways" width="1024" height="767"></p><p>This past week I embarked upon two long car drives — from Philadelphia to Cape Cod and back again — with an almost-two year-old. He’s a remarkably good traveler who takes everything in his stride (as long as he has his puffy stickers and you agree to put Elmo on the radio from time to time).</p><p>The biggest challenge was finding places for him to eat well: restaurants that wouldn’t bat an eyelid at a toddler doing toddler things at the table, that also would have the kinds of food that he likes. (Yes, I packed snacks. But sometimes it’s time to sit down for a real meal.)</p><p>We made it work, but it was always a bit of a guessing game. Would X chain or Y mom-and-pop accommodate his needs? I found myself wishing that there was some kind of app that would just recommend somewhere to go — particularly as he could get hungry at a moment’s notice, and faffing around with restaurant reviews while I was driving was an impossibility.</p><p>So out of interest, once I returned, I asked ChatGPT for recommendations:</p><blockquote><p>Find a restaurant suitable for attending with a toddler in Elkins Park, PA. Please just return the restaurant name and address; don't share any other information.</p></blockquote><p>It returns:</p><blockquote><p>The Creekside Co-op<br />7909 High School Rd, Elkins Park, PA 19027</p></blockquote><p>That’s pretty good! Creekside is a local marketplace and brewery near where I live that absolutely is suitable for hanging out with a toddler.</p><p>I tried it in a few locations. In the part of Cape Cod where we were staying, it suggested the <a href="https://moonakiscafe.com/">Moonakis Cafe</a>, which is a superb choice. In the part of Oxford, England, where I grew up, it suggested <a href="https://butcombe.com/the-victoria-arms-oxfordshire/">The Victoria Arms</a> — again, no complaints whatsoever. I’d eat there with my little one in a heartbeat.</p><p>So what if I want to make this a simple app, starting on the web?</p><p>It turns out that you can replace the name of the location in the query with its GPS coordinates, which simplifies matters a great deal. You can get <a href="https://w3c.github.io/geolocation/">the user’s current location via the web geolocation API</a>: you can then plug that straight into the query, make an API call, and forward the user directly to a Google Maps view for the restaurant. Reverse geocoding APIs, which take latitude and longitude and return a human-readable name, <a href="https://www.geoapify.com/reverse-geocoding-api/">are also available</a>, and might be useful — but they tend to cost money, and the API call to ChatGPT is already an expense.</p><p>More refinements are possible, of course. Most crucially, it would be helpful to know if a given restaurant is actually open; on a road trip, it would also be very useful to find restaurants that are close to the freeway. I wouldn’t mind seeing a top 3 or top 5 list with the relative merits of each one. And being able to plan a trip around toddler-friendly eating spots in advance would be gold.</p><p>What’s sort of neat about the technology is that this is all actually very feasible — <em>in an hour or two</em>. Using AI as an engine in this way cuts out a lot of development time, not to mention the need to gather your own database. There are obviously ethical issues related to how these models were trained, which are sure to be litigated for years to come. But here we’re not creating any new content or replacing an artist: we’re making it easier to find our way to a local business.</p><p>The next time I’m on a road trip with my little one and I see that he’s starting to get hungry, I’ll be able to hit a button on my phone and get directions to a nearby place that will probably be appropriate for him to sit down and eat at. I think that’s cool.</p></div>

## Automating ZFS snapshots for peace of mind

date: 2024-08-21, from: OS News

One feature I couldn’t live without anymore is snapshots. As system administrators, we often find ourselves in situations where we’ve made a mistake, need to revert to a previous state, or need access to a log that has been rotated and disappeared. Since I started using ZFS, all of this has become incredibly simple, and I feel much more at ease when making any modifications. However, since I don’t always remember to create a manual snapshot before starting to work, I use an automatic snapshot system. For this type of snapshot, I use the&#160;excellent&#160;zfs-autobackup&#160;tool&#160;&#8211; which I also&#160;use for backups. The goal is to have a single, flexible, and configurable tool without having to learn different syntaxes. ↫ Stefano Marinelli I&#8217;m always a little sad about the fact that the kind of advanced features modern file systems like ZFS, btrfs, and others offer are so inaccessible to mere desktop users like myself. While I understand they&#8217;re primarily designed for server use, they&#8217;re still making their way to desktops &#8211; my Fedora installations all default to btrfs &#8211; and I&#8217;d love to be able to make use of their advanced features straight from within KDE (or GNOME or whatever it is you use). Of course, that&#8217;s neither here or there for the article at hand, which will be quite useful for people administering FreeBSD and/or Linux systems, and who would like to get the most out of ZFS by automating some of its functionality.

## White House downplays Chinese concerns over possible US nuclear strategy change

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

Seoul, South Korea — White House officials on Wednesday appeared to downplay Beijing’s sentiment that it is “seriously concerned” after a report alleged the United States recently approved a secret plan to shift some of the focus of its nuclear strategy away from Russia to deal with Beijing's nuclear weapons buildup.   


“The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat,” National Security Council Spokesman Sean Savett told VOA in response to emailed questions. “We have repeatedly voiced concerns about the advancing nuclear arsenals of Russia, [China] and [North Korea].” 


“The most recent guidance builds on what was issued by previous administrations — there is far more continuity than change,” he said. 


Savett did not provide details of the new strategy but noted that “while the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret.” 


Late Tuesday, The New York Times reported that U.S. President Joe Biden in March approved a new “nuclear employment guidance,” a highly classified document outlining how the U.S. would use nuclear weapons in a potential conflict.


The report said the document, updated every four years, reorients U.S. nuclear deterrent strategy to deal with China’s massive expansion of its nuclear arsenal. The document also orders U.S. forces to prepare for the possibility of “coordinated nuclear challenges” from China, Russia, and North Korea, according to the report.




Asked about the report during a press briefing Wednesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson accused the United States of “peddling the China nuclear threat narrative” and “finding excuses to seek strategic advantage.”


"China is seriously concerned about the relevant report, and the facts have fully proven that the United States has constantly stirred up the so-called China nuclear threat theory in recent years," said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning.


Russia has not responded to the report.


For decades, U.S. nuclear policy has been primarily focused on Russia, the only other country with comparable nuclear weapons capabilities.


However, U.S. officials have increasingly warned that China’s nuclear buildup under President Xi Jinping is proceeding faster than previously expected.


In an unclassified document released late last year, the Pentagon estimated that the Chinese military had more than 500 operational warheads in its arsenal and will have more than 1,000 warheads by 2030.


That compares to the United States, which possesses a nuclear stockpile of about 3,700 active warheads, according to estimates compiled by the U.S.-based Arms Control Association.


Russia has roughly 4,380 nuclear warheads, including about 1,550 on strategic delivery systems, according to estimates cited by the group.


Given those numbers, Russia remains the “major driver” behind U.S. nuclear strategy, said Daryl G. Kimball, the director of the Arms Control Association, in a post on social media site X.


The Times report overstates the changes outlined in the U.S. nuclear weapons guidance document, according to Kimball, who insisted there has been no reorientation away from Russia toward China.


“Despite China’s nuclear expansion, Russia’s arsenal significantly exceeds that of China’s - even after Xi’s ambitious plan is complete. Until that changes, focus will remain on Russia’s arsenal,” said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists.


“But planning against China is increasing, as reflected in the document,” Kristensen added in a post on X.


U.S. officials have publicly referred to the nuclear weapons document at least twice, without offering much detail on its contents.


In June, Pranay Vaddi, the White House National Security Council’s senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, said the new guidance “emphasizes the need to account for the growth and diversity” of China’s nuclear arsenal, as well the need to deter Russia, China, and North Korea simultaneously.


According to Vaddi, the U.S. will continue to pursue nuclear arms restraints with Russia and China, but “without a change in the trajectory that Russia, [China], and North Korea are on,” the U.S. “will need to continue to adjust our posture and capabilities to ensure our ability to deter and meet other objectives going forward.”


Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear security specialist who until recently focused on nuclear policy in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that Biden “recently issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries, and, in particular, the significant increase in the size and diversity of [China’s] nuclear arsenal.”


“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped or wished it would be,” said Narang. “It is possible that we will one day look back and see the quarter century after the Cold War as ‘nuclear intermission’.”


U.S. and Chinese officials both frequently speak of the dangers of nuclear war, but efforts to hold dialogue on the issue have failed.


Last year, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to negotiations on nuclear non-proliferation and arms control, ahead of a meeting between Biden and Xi. But China suspended the talks last month, citing U.S. arms sales to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own.


Many analysts are also concerned about growing military and diplomatic cooperation between Russia and China. In 2022, Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on a “no-limits” partnership and have recently expanded joint military exercises and other cooperation.


Earlier this year, Russia also restored a Cold War-era mutual defense treaty with nuclear-armed North Korea and hinted at further defense cooperation.


Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin has repeatedly issued thinly veiled threats about using nuclear weapons against Western-backed forces there.

## This Isn’t the Same Kind of Climate Election

date: 2024-08-21, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE3NjIxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NTU0NjAwMn0.ZZCen9aLdBiUl-0SsjzTUCrNtTrnuINpr02cB_Mc3UY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Democrats are gathering in Chicago this week for their quadrennial convention and to celebrate Kamala Harris’s nomination for president. This year’s convention will look different from 2020’s for many reasons — but one of them is that we’re likely to hear far less about climate change. Unlike in 2020, when President Joe Biden described global warming as one of “four overlapping crises” confronting the country, Harris has been more subtle when discussing it.
</p><p>
	So … is that a problem? Should we be freaked out? On this week’s episode of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse discuss the modern electoral politics of climate change. We talk about whether the electorate’s interest in climate issues has faded, how the Inflation Reduction Act could affect voting, and why a “quiet on climate” strategy might be okay. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>The other thing that I think is really fascinating — and I've felt like this is a case that a political scientist could certainly have more to say about — but it feels like this is a case that the focus on climate in the 117th Congress, the Congress that passed the infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, was, I think, largely elite-driven. Like inside-the-Beltway priority-setting, not so much a general response to polling, even though you're right, there was an energy crisis that actually happened towards the tail end of that legislative debate.
	<br/>
<br/>
And the original agenda was the Build Back Better agenda from the Biden administration, which is really trying to center these investments in new economies, new industries — including clean energy — as part of a broader post-COVID economic recovery.
	<br/>
<br/>
What was fascinating to me is that, you know, the Build Back Better Act was really a cost of living-focused bill. It had a huge amount of programs focused on the cost of childcare, on elder care, on healthcare. And all of that got stripped out as the bill moved on and eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act, which primarily centered around climate and clean energy investment with a small residual piece around prescription drugs and extending Affordable Care Act subsidies for lower middle class folks that rely on the insurance exchanges. Most of the stuff that would now, I think, be hugely popular in this electoral cycle because it much more centrally spoke to the concerns about cost of living got pulled out at the behest of folks like Joe Manchin, who wanted to strip the bill down and not focus on expanding social programs.
	<br/>
<br/>
So it's kind of an interesting dynamic. If I were to look at polls and use those polls to have predicted which pieces would fall out of the bill as the Build Back Better Act moved through the hand to hand combat of congressional passage, I would have expected it would have been climate because it's always low on the priority list when you look at polling, but it was actually the exact opposite.
	<br/>
<br/>
I think there was a sense in the halls of Congress that climate was the one thing you couldn't jettison because that was their one chance to take a shot at it. And they didn't know when they would get another shot.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I want to moderate that — or I want to disagree slightly on a few things. I totally agree, first of all, that climate acted in the IRA negotiations primarily as an elite-driven issue. And I think that is often ignored in conversations about the IRA, and I think it is actually quite important to hit home that point because it should lead to better decision-making in the future — both as people who want to see the federal government continue to push on decarbonization and also people interested in political actors making smart choices and decisions around decarbonization.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that a lot of that so-called care-focused policy in the IRA, I think it fell out for two reasons. The first is that Democrats thought that they were going to be able to get a better deal from Manchin. Manchin agreed to terms in October 2021, he agreed to a set of terms that Democrats kind of then just blew past. They thought that basically by bullying him, by ignoring his demands, he was going to give way and allow a larger bill, and he ultimately did not.
	<br/>
<br/>
But No. 2, I guess I would add that the other place where the care economy stuff got really hit was that some of the policy design seemed pretty bad. There were white papers that came out or blog posts that came out during the October 2021 to March 2022 period that suggested that there were going to be real unintended consequences, especially around the childcare policy, that had not been seriously looked at. And while I don't think those blog posts or analysis played a decisive role, I do think that — I remember Matt Bruenig wrote 
	<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/democratic-childcare-proposal-hurts-families/620749/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a big piece here</u></a> — I do think that that led to Democrats being more willing to jettison the policy because they felt like that policy had emerged from kind of a morass of foundation-funded nonprofits and maybe hadn't gotten the close inspection that it needed —<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>It wasn't quite ready for …<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>It wasn't quite ready for primetime, and in a different way than the energy tax credits in the IRA were ready for primetime — because to some degree, they were a giant expansion on policy that Congress had already done for a while, right? And obviously there were new tax credits, too. But there was an existing economic record that Congress could subsidize clean via the tax code and not create massive, massive unintended, distortionary effects in the economy that did not exist for, say, childcare.

## DNC's Day 2: Double dose of Obama firepower, a doting spouse and a dance party

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — The Democratic National Convention's second night showcased a double dose of Obama firepower to validate Vice President Kamala Harris and deliver an unsparing indictment of Republican Donald Trump. The convention also served up a raucous roll call of states that was essentially one big dance party.


Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, ducked out of Chicago to hold a rally just up the interstate in Milwaukee, wooing voters in battleground Wisconsin. It was a recognition that, regardless of whatever good vibes may exist at the convention, Democrats expect this presidential election to be razor-close.


Here are some takeaways from the convention's second night.


The ex-presidents club


If the Republican convention was all about Trump, the Democrats on Tuesday wanted to put Harris in a pantheon with past presidents.


The biggest validators of the night were former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. The latter linked Harris with her husband by telling the rapt crowd, “America, hope is making a comeback.”


Barack Obama, for his part, reached back to his own 2004 convention speech to tie Harris to his legacy. “I am feeling hopeful -- because this convention has always been pretty good to kids with funny names who believe in a country where everything is possible,” he said.


It wasn’t just the Obamas making the case for the vice president. The grandsons of Jimmy Carter and John F. Kennedy also portrayed her as the natural heir of past Democratic leaders.


As groundbreaking as Harris’ candidacy is as the first woman of color to be her party’s nominee, these speeches by an ex-president and presidential progeny were all about linking her to a broader historical arc and evoking the excitement of Obama’s 2008 run that Harris hopes to replicate.


Diverting from the high road


The Obamas did not hold back in lacing into Trump. Michelle Obama's well-worn adage from years past that “when they go low, we go high” no longer seemed operative.


Barack Obama called Trump “a 78-year-old billionaire who hasn’t stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago.”


Michelle Obama also took a personal swipe, saying: “For years, Donald Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black.”


Playing off her famous line about Republicans going low, Michelle Obama suggested that Trump was going “small” and that “it’s unhealthy, and quite frankly, it’s unpresidential.”


DNC dance party


Political conventions technically happen so that delegates can nominate presidential and vice presidential candidates.


This year, the Democrats took care of that job in advance. But that didn't stop them from holding a ceremonial do-over and turning it into a raucous dance party.


DJ Cassidy strode on stage in a bright blue double-breasted suit and spun tunes for every state as they nominated Harris and Walz. Minnesota got “1999” by native son Prince, Kansas got “Carry on Wayward Son” by, well, Kansas. “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen played as New Jersey weighed in.


Usually it was governors or state party chairs calling out the votes, but some states passed the mic to make serious points. Kate Cox, who unsuccessfully sued her home state of Texas while seeking an abortion for a non-viable fetus, announced Texas’ votes. A survivor of the 2017 Las Vegas strip gun massacre announced Nevada’s votes.


The roll call highlight was when Atlanta rapper Lil Jon strode through the United Center to the beats of “Turn Down for What,” his song with DJ Snake, and rapped his support for Harris and Walz.


Democrats are eager to highlight how Harris’ ascension has energized the party. The roll call fit that vibe.


America’s blind date with Doug Emhoff


Doug Emhoff wants America to love his wife as much as he does.


His convention speech Tuesday night focused on their love story and offered a personal glimpse meant to pull in voters, too. He dished on the deets of their first phone call, after he left her a rambling voicemail that she still makes him listen to every year on their anniversary.


“I love that laugh,” he said adoringly, a rebuttal to Trump’s criticism of Harris’ laughter.


As Harris flew back to Chicago from Milwaukee after her rally there, Air Force Two spent an extra 10 minutes in the air so she could watch her husband speak, according to an aide.


Emhoff said he “just fell in love fast” with Harris, adding that she finds “joy in pursuing justice” and “stands up to bullies.” It’s not how most husbands describe their partners, but, then, Emhoff is trying to convince voters that the woman he’s been married to for 10 years this Thursday knows how to take on Trump.


A message for Republicans: It’s OK to quit Trump


The Democrats are making a play for disaffected Trump voters — and they used one of his former White House staffers to make their case.


Stephanie Grisham worked in various roles in the Trump White House, including communications director and press secretary, allowing Democrats to argue that those who know Trump best have seen him at his worst.


“He has no empathy, no morals, and no fidelity to the truth,” Grisham said. “I couldn’t be part of the insanity any longer."


Kyle Sweetser, a Trump voter from Alabama, told the convention the former president’s tariffs made life harder for construction workers like him. Republican Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, also spoke about why he’s backing Harris. Giles sees Trump’s policies as hurting cities like his.

## Obamas close DNC's second night with rousing Harris endorsement

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — Warning of a difficult fight ahead, former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama on Tuesday called on the nation to embrace Kamala Harris in urgent messages to the Democratic National Convention that were at times both hopeful and foreboding.


"America, hope is making a comeback," the former first lady declared. She then tore into Republican Donald Trump, a sharp shift from the 2016 convention speech in which she told her party, "When they go low, we go high."


"His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who also happened to be Black," Obama said of Trump.


Her husband, the nation's first Black president pushing for America to elect its second, called Trump "a 78-year-old billionaire who hasn't stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden escalator nine years ago."




"It's been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that's actually gotten worse now that he's afraid of losing to Kamala," he charged.


The fiery messages from two of the Democratic Party's biggest stars underscored the urgency of the moment as Harris works to stitch together a broad coalition in her bid to defeat Trump this fall. She is drawing on stars like the Obamas and other celebrities, officials from the far left to the middle, and even some Republicans to boost her campaign.


And while the theme of the night was "a bold vision for America's future," the disparate factions of Harris' evolving coalition demonstrated, above all, that they are connected by a deep desire to prevent a second Trump presidency.


Just ahead of the Obamas' remarks, Harris addressed an estimated 15,000 people in battleground Wisconsin in the arena where Republicans held their convention last month. She declared that she was running "a people-powered campaign."


"Together we will chart a new way forward," the vice president said in remarks that were partially broadcast to the DNC. "A future for freedom, opportunity, of optimism and faith."


Back in Chicago, Senators Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent beloved by progressives, both praised Harris. And in an appearance perhaps intended to needle Trump, his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham — now a harsh critic of her former boss — also took the convention stage.


Trump "has no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth," Grisham said. "I love my country more than my party. Kamala Harris tells the truth. She respects the American people. And she has my vote."


Still, it was not all serious on the second night of the four-day convention.


A symbolic roll call in which delegates from each state pledged their support for the Democratic nominee turned into a party atmosphere. A DJ played a mix of state-specific songs — and Atlanta native Lil Jon ran out during Georgia's turn to his hit song with DJ Snake, "Turn Down for What," to the delight of the thousands inside the cavernous United Center.


Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who will become the nation's first gentleman if his wife wins the presidency, shared personal details about his relationship with Harris — their cooking habits, their first date and her laugh, which is often mocked by Republican critics.


"You know that laugh. I love that laugh!" Emhoff said as the crowd cheered. Later, he added, "Her empathy is her strength."


Trump, meanwhile, was out on the campaign trail as part of his weeklong swing-state tour during the Democratic convention. He went to Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday and stood aside sheriff's deputies as he labeled Harris the "ringleader" of a "Marxist attack on law enforcement" across the country.


"Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death," Trump said in one of many generalizations about an America under Harris.


Harris, meanwhile, cast the election in dire, almost existential terms. She implored Americans not to get complacent in light of the Supreme Court decision carving out broad presidential immunity, a power she said Trump would abuse.


She has also seized on Trump's opposition to a nationally guaranteed right to abortion.


"They seemingly don't trust women," she said of Trump and his Republican allies. "Well, we trust women."


The vice president's speech evoked some of the same themes that underlaid Biden's case for reelection before he dropped out, casting Trump as a threat to democracy. Harris argued that Trump threatens the values and freedoms that Americans hold dear.


Someone with that record "should never again have the opportunity to stand behind the seal of the president of the United States," Harris said. "Never again."

## Protesters arrested after clash with police outside Chicago's Israeli consulate

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters charged a line of police in an intense standoff with hundreds of officers outside the Israeli consulate Tuesday on the second night of the Democratic National Convention.


After the larger gathering began to disperse, splintering off into smaller groups, other interactions with police led to more than a dozen arrests. Officers called the demonstrations "an unlawful assembly."


Earlier in the night, officers carrying wooden clubs shouted "move" and penned the demonstrators in on the street, preventing them from marching.


Some demonstrators set an American flag on fire in the street as the celebratory roll call for Vice President Kamala Harris took place inside the United Center about 3.2 kilometers away. Others carried Palestinian flags, while many others wore black and covered their faces.


As protesters regrouped and approached a line of police in riot gear in front of a Chicago skyscraper that houses the Israeli consulate, an officer said into a megaphone, "You are ordered to immediately disburse." A woman in the front of the march shouted back with her own megaphone: "We're not scared of you."


A man in a Chicago Bulls hat, his face covered by a balaclava, called on protesters to "shut down the DNC." The group, which is not affiliated with the coalition of over 200 groups that organized Monday's protests, advertised the demonstration Tuesday under the slogan of "Make it great like '68," invoking the anti-Vietnam War protests that seized the city during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.


The atmosphere with rows of police in riot gear was a stark contrast to a day earlier when thousands of pro-Palestinian activists, including families pushing babies in strollers, marched near the convention site calling for a cease-fire.


Police kept protesters confined to a block of Madison Street, a normally bustling downtown thoroughfare where traffic was halted on both ends Tuesday evening.




Law enforcement had closed down most of the entrances to the building on Tuesday, allowing commuters to come in only one entrance where armed officers were also posted. Many of the building's shops were closed. Martha Hill, a spokeswoman for the Metra commuter rail service, said train service was running as normal.


The consulate has been the site of numerous demonstrations since the war in Gaza began in October. It is in a building connected to the Ogilvie Transportation Center, a major commuter rail station.


Mohammed Ismail, a 29-year-old psychiatry resident who lives in Chicago, described the police presence as "excessive," and questioned why the group had been blocked from marching. He said he joined the protest to urge Democrats to cease funding to Israel.


"It's not right that we're sending our tax money to fund an ongoing slaughter, an ongoing genocide," Ismail said. "We're a part of this conflict because our money is paying for it."


Meanwhile, the sites of demonstrations from the previous night were largely quiet. Thirteen people were arrested during Monday's protests, most them related to a "brief breach" of security fencing "within sight and sound of the United Center," the city's police superintendent said.


Israel supporters, including some relatives of people kidnapped by Hamas, gathered earlier in the day at a pro-Israel art installation not far from the consulate to call on U.S. leaders to continue backing Israel and pushing for the release of hostages. The art installation included giant milk cartons bearing photos of some of the hostages.




Elan Carr, CEO of the Israeli-American Council, condemned the pro-Palestinian protesters who have descended on Chicago this week, calling them "fringe crazies" and demanding that U.S. leaders "stand unequivocally with the state of Israel."


More protests were planned throughout the week. However, attendance at the main rally on Monday was far below estimates of organizers who had predicted more than 20,000 would show up.


Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said Tuesday that the crowd was around 3,500 strong and that the vast majority of the protesters were peaceful.


However, some clashed with police, used pepper spray against them and threw water bottles at officers during the clash in the park where there was a breach in security fencing, Snelling said. He said officers did not use any chemical sprays.


"Our officers showed great restraint," he said at a news conference. "We're not going to tolerate vandalism and violence in our city. ... We're going to continue to protect the city."


Snelling said with more protests planned, his department is prepared to de-escalate situations whenever possible.


"Again, we're up to the challenge," Snelling said. "The city is up to the challenge."


The park where the most arrests were made, located a block from the convention arena, served as a destination point for a march of thousands calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Several dozen activists broke off from the main group, breached the fencing, and were pushed back by police.


Authorities said the inner security perimeter surrounding the United Center was not breached and there was no threat to those attending the convention.


On Tuesday morning, an extra line of fencing was installed at the park and the tall metal barriers were reinforced to prevent protesters from lifting and removing the panels. No police officers or protesters were in the park early Tuesday.




The 13 people arrested during Monday's protest were detained on charges ranging from criminal trespass and resisting and obstructing an arrest, to aggravated battery of police officers, Snelling said.


At least 10 of them were arrested in connection with the fence, he said.


Snelling said he did not connect those who tore down the fence with the entirety of the march. He said the vast majority of participants were peaceful, and he praised his officers' conduct in the moment.


The Chicago chapter of the National Lawyers Guild said two of the people arrested were hospitalized. Snelling said they were not taken to the hospital for injuries, but "so they could be provided the treatment they needed when it came to their medications."


Two people were also arrested on misdemeanor property damage and resisting arrest charges during a protest march Sunday night. As of Tuesday morning, 15 people had been arrested.


Most of the largest demonstrations have been organized by the Coalition to March on the DNC, which has focused on calling for a cease-fire in Gaza. But smaller protests have popped up around the city, during the convention's welcome party at Navy Pier.

## Political criticism and controversy swirls ahead of China video game release

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

washington —  The release of a Chinese video game touted as the country’s first to meet Triple-A standards, has sparked a flurry of online criticism of the Chinese government.


Video games are given a AAA label when they are backed by big funds, highly developed and distributed by well-known publishers.


The Aug. 20 worldwide release of the Chinese game Black Myth: Wukong has been anticipated since its demo got more than 56 million views on the Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili in 2020.


On YouTube, which is banned in China, the game demo had more than 10 million views.


Developed by China-based Game Science, the game has players take on the role of the Monkey King, a character from the Chinese classic novel Journey to the West, and defeat monsters wreaking havoc on the world.


Although the game has no direct connection to politics, Chinese commenters took to a U.S.–based gaming discussion board ahead of the release to criticize the Chinese government and President Xi Jinping.  


The discussion board on Steam, a Washington state-based online gaming platform, was hit with a slew of comments in Chinese last week that directly and indirectly criticized Chinese authorities and Xi.  


One mocked Xi’s unprecedented third term as leader, saying, "I will continue to be Jade Emperor in Black Myth: Wukong. Raise your hands if you oppose it."


Most critical posts ranted against the Chinese government, in ways unrelated to the game.


"Overthrow the Communist Party of China and establish a democratic constitutional system where everyone has a vote," read what appeared to be the first critical comment.  


"Thank you to the party, thank you to our great chief accelerator, Xi Jinping," another comment reads, mocking Xi’s policies as accelerating China's economic decline.


Another post listed the timeline of the weeks-long 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests and the subsequent violent crackdown that occurred when Chinese troops used lethal force against student-led demonstrators, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands.


Such critical comments of China’s government and leaders are not allowed on China’s internet, where an army of censors frequently scrubs websites and discussion boards of comments that do not follow the Chinese Communist Party’s line.  


Observers were surprised to find by the afternoon of Aug. 16, many of the critical posts on Steam’s U.S. discussion board had similarly been removed.  


Li Ying, a Chinese social media influencer and government critic known online as Teacher Li, posted his opposition to the removal on Aug. 14 on X with screenshots of the original posts.


"Steam is inherently a free platform, with a wide variety of games here, and players are free to express any opinions and opinions about the game," he wrote on X.


Steam's China-based website does not have a discussion board, and the U.S.-based discussion board is only available to users outside China. Those inside China need to use a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which helps users bypass controls to access internet content outside the country that is blocked.


VOA reached out to Steam seeking comment about why the posts were deleted but did not receive a reply. Steam's discussion board rules do not explicitly prohibit political posts but say that users are not allowed to post “disrespectful” content and to avoid posting content unrelated to the topic.


While the game is not directly connected to the Chinese government, it did receive some official help and praise. The city government of Hangzhou, where Game Science is located, gave the game a grant in 2022. State media in the province, Zhejiang, described the game as "one of the most important explorers in the history of AAA games in China – an explorer that deserves applause and encouragement."


It’s not the first time Black Myth: Wukong has stirred up some controversy.


The game's developers have been accused of making lewd and sexist remarks.


Feng Ji, the founder and CEO of Game Science, in a Weibo post last year lamenting the difficulties in development, used words with erotic connotations and compared his desire for expanding development to oral sex.


Yang Qi, the game's artistic director, remarked as early as 2013 on Weibo that they would not pander to female players in the game's production.


"I don't need the reverse drive of female players. I don't take care of those lewd insects who come to pick up girls; some things are made for pure men," he wrote.


In response, a female influencer posted on the gender-focused WeChat account Orange Umbrella, urging Game Science to respect female gamers.


"As a fellow player, I know how much hard work and dedication it takes to make a game, and Black Myth: Wukong's dedication and seriousness in the production are commendable," she wrote. "However, don't let the backward gender consciousness push players who are also full of expectations for the game in the opposite direction more and more."


When Western media, including IGN, one of the most influential U.S. online news sites for video games, reported last year on the controversial comments, nationalist Chinese commenters called the coverage an attempt to impose western values and put down China’s gaming industry.


"Judging the Chinese game with the politically correct stance of the West is really biased for the media," a review article reads. The article said whether the developers' remarks constituted sexism "depends on the perspective."


On Weibo, one commenter called IGN a "clown" and wrote, "In order to suppress the rise of Chinese games, the gender card is unsurprisingly played again."


Despite the controversies, gaming industry experts expect Black Myth: Wukong to be a big hit.


Daniel Camilo, a game industry consultant based in southern China’s Shenzhen city, noted to VOA that sexism in the gaming industry is not new and has little impact on commercial success.


"Hardcore gamers and fans that actively discuss these issues and are aware of them usually represent a very small [loud] minority online that accounts for a small residual amount of those who actually buy games," he said.


The game has already received high praise from reviewers in China and abroad.


IGN gave the game an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 on Aug. 16, calling it a "great action game with great fights and exciting and powerful opponents, albeit with a few bugs."


The Chinese version of IGN gave the game a perfect score of 10, writing, "This is a truly competitive domestic game in the global market, and I believe it will be a strong contender for this year's Game of the Year."


Camilo noted the high quality of the homegrown game has given Chinese players something to be proud of that might even help improve China's international image.


"Black Myth will change perceptions people have regarding Chinese games and, to some extent, China and its cultural output and soft power really," he said.

<p>[<a href="https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/publications/ai-in-journalism-futures-2024">Open Society Foundations</a>]</p><blockquote><p>"In February 2024, the Open Society Foundations issued a call for applications for a convening in which selected participants would share their visions of an AI-mediated future."</p></blockquote><p>I thought this, from the concluding observations, was telling:</p><blockquote><p>"Participants were generally
reluctant or unable to articulate exactly how AI might transform the information ecosystem. [...] Relatively few submitted scenarios described an AI-driven transformation in specific detail, and it was clear that many participants who were convinced that AI would fundamentally restructure the information ecosystem also had no specific point of view on how that might occur."</p></blockquote><p>In other words, while many people in journalism see that this set of technologies may transform their industry, and are potentially excited or terrified that it will, they have no idea how that will happen. This is the very definition of hype: one can imagine people proclaiming that blockchain, or push notifications, or RealMedia, or WebTV might do the same.</p><p>It's not that there are no uses for AI (just like it's not that there are no uses for blockchain). It will find its way into end-user applications, underpin newsroom tools, and power data-driven newsroom investigations, without a doubt. But the hype far exceeds that, and will eventually, inevitably, deflate.</p><p>In the meantime, journalists are not as worried about the technologies themselves as who controls them:</p><blockquote><p>"Throughout the application process and workshop discussions, it became clear that much of the conversation was not actually about AI, nor about journalism, nor about the current or future information ecosystem, but instead about power. It was clear that power, and the potential for transfers of power from one group to another, was the explicit or implicit subject of many of the submitted scenarios as well as the five final scenarios that were distilled from the workshop."</p></blockquote><p>Technologists, in turn, were blind to these power dynamics, while simultaneously predicting more dramatic changes. There's a fundamental truth here: it's ultimately about money, and who controls the platforms that allow readers to read about the world around them.</p><p>Same as it ever was: that's been the struggle on the web since its inception. AI just shifts the discussion to a new set of platforms.</p>

## US says classified nuclear strategy not response to single country, threat

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — A classified nuclear strategic plan approved by President Joe Biden this year is not a response to a single country or threat, the White House said on Tuesday, after the New York Times reported it reoriented the U.S. deterrence strategy to focus on China's expansion of its nuclear arsenal for the first time.


The U.S.-based Arms Control Association said it understood U.S. nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in the administration's 2022 Nuclear Posture Review, and there had been no reorientation away from Russia and toward China.


The New York Times said the White House never announced that Biden approved the revised strategy, titled the "Nuclear Employment Guidance," but an unclassified notification to Congress of the revision is expected to be sent before Biden leaves office.


The newspaper said that in recent speeches, two senior administration officials were allowed to allude to the strategy revision. It said the strategy is updated every four years or so.


Asked about the report, White House spokesperson Sean Savett said: "This administration, like the four administrations before it, issued a Nuclear Posture Review and Nuclear Weapons Employment Planning Guidance.


"While the specific text of the Guidance is classified, its existence is in no way secret. The Guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any single entity, country, nor threat."


Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said that while U.S. intelligence estimates suggest China may increase the size its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia has about 4,000 nuclear warheads "and it remains the major driver behind U.S. nuclear strategy."


Kimball cited June remarks by one of the officials referred to in the Times report, White House Senior Director for Arms Control, Disarmament, and Nonproliferation Pranay Vaddi.


According to those remarks, U.S. strategy was to pursue nuclear arms restraints with China and Russia, but if China continued on its current trajectory and if Russia exceeds New START limits, the U.S. at some point in the future may need to consider adjustments to the size and makeup of its nuclear force, Kimball said.


"My understanding is that the point at which the current administration thinks it might want to consider such changes won't come until 2030, or some time after," he said.

## Trump campaigns in Michigan with 'Make America Safe Again' speech

date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA

HOWELL, Michigan — Former President Donald Trump pledged Tuesday to "Make America Safe Again" while campaigning in Michigan as Democrats gathered in Chicago to nominate Kamala Harris. 


As part of a battleground campaign swing designed to counter the Democratic National Convention, Trump stood alongside sheriff's deputies in the city of Howell and tarred Harris, a former San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general, as the "ringleader" of a "Marxist attack on law enforcement" across the country. 


"Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death," Trump said in one of many generalizations about an America under Harris. "You'll see levels of crime that you've never seen before. ... I will deliver law, order, safety and peace." 


Trump has sought in recent weeks to blunt the enthusiasm that Harris has attracted since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign and endorsed her. That has involved both dark predictions about what electing Harris would mean for the country and efforts by Trump's advisers to set up events where he can try to draw specific policy contrasts. On Tuesday in Michigan, the subject was crime and public safety. 


In excerpts released before his speech, Trump's campaign also said he would call for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers; he did not mention that during his remarks. 


The event was the latest billed as focused on a specific issue. But on these occasions, Trump has spent considerable time attacking Harris personally and taking shots at Biden, and the same was true after their appearances Monday at the Democratic convention. 


"I watched last night in amazement as they tried to pretend everything was great," Trump said, singling out inflation and the U.S.-Mexico border as topics Democrats glossed over. "We have a fool as president," he said of Biden. 


Trump presented a bleak portrait of life in the U.S. and the threat of a Harris presidency, though he was short on specifics and heavy on hyperbole. 


"It's just insane," Trump said. "You can't walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be. And you've seen it, and I've seen it, and it's time for a change." 


Trump making such claims, surrounded by supportive law enforcement officers, stood in stark contrast to the Democrats' convention. Speaker after speaker found ways Monday night in Chicago to remind Americans that Trump is the first former president ever convicted of felony crimes, has been found civilly liable for sexual assault, and still faces multiple indictments, including for his efforts to overturn his 2020 defeat to Biden. 


Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas skewered Trump on Monday night as "a career criminal, with 34 felonies, two impeachments and one porn star," a reference to his payments to an adult film actress at issue in his New York conviction for business fraud. 


The derision reached its peak as Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in 2016, stood back from the podium and smiled as delegates chanted: "Lock him up! Lock him up!" — a turnabout from Trump supporters' chants about Clinton eight years ago despite the former secretary of state never having been charged with any crime.
