In addition to producing auroras, a recent extreme storm provided more detail on how much radiation future astronauts could encounter on the Red Planet. Mars scientists have been anticipating epic solar storms ever since the Sun entered a period of peak activity earlier this year called solar maximum. Over the past month, NASA’s Mars rovers [&#8230;]

## Hunter Biden's lawyers rest their defense in trial on federal gun charges

date: 2024-06-10, from: VOA News USA

WILMINGTON, Delaware — Hunter Biden's lawyers rested their case Monday in the federal criminal trial of the president's son, who is accused of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun in 2018, according to news reports. 


Prosecutors have argued the evidence is clear that Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he checked "no" on the form at the gun shop that asked whether he was "an unlawful user of, or addicted to" drugs. 


Hunter Biden's addiction struggles before getting sober more than five years ago are well documented. But defense lawyers argued that prosecutors failed to prove he was using drugs in the 11 days that he possessed the gun. 


The defense has suggested Hunter Biden had been trying to turn his life around at the time, completing a detoxification and rehabilitation program at the end of August 2018. His daughter Naomi took the stand for the defense last week, telling jurors about visiting him while he was at a California rehab center weeks before he bought the gun.




The defense also tried to cast doubt on the memories of the prosecution's witnesses, pressing them about their recollection of events. 


Hunter Biden was charged with three felonies: lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days. He has pleaded not guilty, 


It's the first of two trials for Hunter Biden in the midst of his father's Democratic reelection campaign. He also is charged with failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes in a case scheduled to go to trial in September in California. 


Hunter Biden has accused the Justice Department of bending to political pressure from former President Donald Trump and other Republicans to bring the gun case and the separate tax charges after a deal with prosecutors fell apart last year. 


The case has put a spotlight on a turbulent time in Hunter Biden's life after the death of his brother, Beau, in 2015. 


Hunter Biden's struggles with addiction before getting sober more than five years ago are well documented. But defense lawyers argue there's no evidence he was actually using drugs in the 11 days that he possessed the gun. He had completed a rehab program weeks earlier. 


Jurors have heard emotional testimony from Hunter Biden's former romantic partners and read personal text messages. They've seen photos of Hunter Biden holding a crack pipe and partly clothed, and video from his phone of crack cocaine weighed on a scale. 


His ex-wife and two former girlfriends testified for prosecutors about his habitual crack use and their failed efforts to help him get clean. One woman, who met Hunter Biden in 2017 at a strip club where she worked, described him smoking crack every 20 minutes or so while she stayed with him at a hotel. 


Hunter Biden has not taken the witness stand. But jurors have heard him describe at length his descent into addiction through audio excerpts played in court of his 2021 memoir, "Beautiful Things." The book, written after he got sober, covers the period he had the gun but doesn't mention it specifically. 


A key witness for prosecutors is Beau's widow, Hallie, who had a brief troubled relationship with Hunter after his brother died of brain cancer. She found the unloaded gun in Hunter's truck on Oct. 23, 2018, panicked and tossed it into a garbage can at a grocery store in Wilmington, where a man inadvertently fished it out of the trash. 


"I didn't want him to hurt himself, and I didn't want my kids to find it and hurt themselves," Hallie Biden told jurors.




From the time Hunter returned to Delaware from a 2018 trip to California until she threw his gun away, she did not see him using drugs, Hallie told jurors. That time period included the day he bought the weapon. But jurors also saw text messages Hunter sent to Hallie in October 2018 saying he was waiting for a dealer and smoking crack. The first message was sent the day after he bought the gun. The second was sent the following day. 


The defense has suggested Hunter Biden had been trying to turn his life around at the time of the gun purchase, having completed a detoxification and rehabilitation program at the end of August 2018. 


"There is no evidence of contemporaneous drug use and a gun possession," defense lawyer Abbe Lowell wrote in court papers filed Friday. "It was only after the gun was thrown away and the ensuing stress ... that the government was able to then find the same type of evidence of his use (e.g., photos, use of drug lingo) that he relapsed with drugs." 


Hunter Biden's daughter Naomi took the stand for the defense Friday, telling jurors about visiting her father while he was at a California rehab center weeks before he bought the gun. She told jurors that he seemed "hopeful" and to be improving, and she told him she was proud of him. As she was dismissed from the stand, she paused to hug her dad before leaving the courtroom. 




The defense on Friday did not rule out calling one more witness, but it was unclear who that could be. Hunter's lawyers previously said they planned to call as a witness Joe Biden's brother, James, and he was at the courthouse on Friday. Testimony from other family members could open the door for more deeply personal messages to be introduced to the jury. 


President Joe Biden said last week that he would accept the jury's verdict and has ruled out a pardon for his son. After flying back from France, President Biden was at his home in Wilmington for the day and was expected in Washington in the evening for a Juneteenth concert. He was scheduled to travel to Italy later this week for the Group of Seven leaders conference. 


Last summer, it looked as if Hunter Biden would avoid prosecution in the gun case altogether, but a deal with prosecutors imploded after U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Republican former President Donald Trump, raised concerns about it. Hunter Biden was subsequently indicted on three felony gun charges. He also faces a trial scheduled for September on felony charges alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years. 


If convicted in the gun case, he faces up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.

## Void Linux on ZFS

date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News

Last night, I ran through the&#160;ZFSBootMenu documentation guide for Void&#160;and followed it both on a VM and then on an external SATA HDD plugged through a USB case, taking some notes and getting a general idea of the process. The Void installer does not support ZFS out of the box, so the Void Handbook itself recommends the ZFSBootMenu documentation before its own (a manual chroot installation) when it comes to doing a ZFS-on-root install. This guide from ZFSBootMenu is what we’ll be following throughout this post. ↫ Juno Takano There&#8217;s a ton of good stuff in this lengthy, detailed, and helpful blog post. First, it covers Void Linux, which is one of the best signifiers of good taste, classy style, and generally being a good person. Void is not necessarily underappreciated &#8211; it gets a lot of mentions in the right places &#8211; but I do feel there are a lot more people for whom Void Linux would be a perfect fit but who don&#8217;t yet know about it. So, time for a very short introduction. Void Linux is distribution with its own unique and very user-friendly package manager that&#8217;s an absolute joy to use. Unlike many other custom, more obscure package formats, the Void repositories are vast, generally some of the most up-to-date, and you&#8217;ll be hard-pressed to be asking for some piece of software that isn&#8217;t packaged. Void eschews systemd in favour of runit, and while I personally have no issues with systemd, diversity is always welcome and runit is, in line with everything else Void, easy to grasp and use. Lastly, while Void also comes in a GNU libc flavour, it feels like the &#8220;real&#8221; Void Linux is the one using musl. Second is a tool I had never heard of: ZFSBootMenu. The name is rather self-explanatory, but in slightly more detail: it&#8217;s a self-contained small Linux-based bootloader that detects any Linux kernels and initramfs images on ZFS file systems, which can then be launched using kexec. It makes running Linux on ZFS quite a bit easier, especially for systems that don&#8217;t over ZFS as an option during installation, like, in this case, Void Linux. And that&#8217;s what the linked post is actually about: setting up a root-on-ZFS Void EFI installation. It&#8217;s a great companion article for anyone trying something similar.

## Reverse-engineering MenuetOS 64: primary boot loader

date: 2024-06-10, from: OS News

Now that we have the MenuetOS 64 disk image file (M6414490.IMG), it is time to analyze! We will analyze the image file both statically and dynamically. Static analysis is reading and analyzing code without running it, whereas dynamic analysis is running the code and watching how it changes registers and memory during execution. Each analysis mode compliments the other; there are some things that can only be discerned through code execution, like register values or stack layout at a specific point in time during execution. Static analysis is useful for “filling in the blanks” when executing code to understand what the code should do next (or just did). Since MenuetOS 64 is written in Intel x64 assembly, our static analysis will consist of memory mapped disassembly in Ghidra. After reading this post, readers should understand how to launch a MenuetOS 64 virtual machine using QEMU as well as how to attach a debugger (gdb) to QEMU in order to debug while code is executing. Also, readers should understand how MenuetOS 64 begins the boot process as control of execution is passed to MenuetOS 64 code from the virtualization firmware. ↫ Nicholas Starke This is an old post &#8211; from late 2022 &#8211; but a great read nonetheless, and considering MenuetOS doesn&#8217;t change very much from year to year, it&#8217;s still mostly relevant.

## Former Politico Owner Launches New Journalism Finishing School To Try And Fix All The ‘Wokeness’

<blockquote><p>"There’s an ocean of problems with journalism, but the idea that there’s just too damn much woke progressivism is utter delusion. U.S. journalism generally tilts center right on the political spectrum."</p></blockquote><p>This is a story about the founder of Politico creating a "teaching hospital for journalists" that appears to be in opposition to "wokeness". But it's also about much of the state of incumbent journalism, which is still grappling with the wave of much-needed social change that is inspiring movements around the world.</p><blockquote><p>"In the wake of Black Lives Matter and COVID there was some fleeting recommendations to the ivy league establishment media that we could perhaps take a slightly more well-rounded, inclusive approach to journalism. In response, the trust fund lords in charge of these establishment outlets lost their [...] minds, started crying incessantly about young journalists “needing safe spaces,” and decided to double down on all their worst impulses, having learned less than nothing along the way."</p></blockquote><p>Exactly. Asinine efforts like anti-woke journalism schools aren't what we need; we need better intersectional representation inside newsrooms, we need better representation of the real stories that need to be told across the country and across the world, and we need to dismantle institutional systems that have acted as gatekeepers for generations.</p><p>All power to the outlets, independent journalists, and foundations that are truly trying to push for something better.

## US needs Japan's help to boost military production, ambassador says

date: 2024-06-10, from: VOA News USA

Tokyo — The United States needs Japan's help to cope with strategic challenges in Europe and Asia that are straining its defense industries, the U.S. ambassador to Japan said on Monday as the countries kicked off talks on military industrial cooperation.


"Our national security strategy calls for us to be able to handle one and a half theaters, that's a major war and another one to a stand-off, and with both the Middle East, Ukraine, and keeping our deterrence credible in this region (East Asia) you can already see that we are in two plus," Rahm Emanuel told reporters. 


On Sunday, Japan and the U.S. kicked off their first talks in Tokyo on forging deeper defense industry collaboration under the U.S.-Japan Forum on Defense Industrial Cooperation, Acquisition and Sustainment (DICAS) established in April by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and U.S. President Joe Biden.  


Discussions on Tuesday between U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William A. LaPlante and Masaki Fukasawa, the head of Japan’s Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Agency, will focus on naval repairs in Japan that could help free up U.S. yards to build more warships.


"China has a major capacity we already know that will surpass us on new shipbuilding," Emanuel said.  


Other potential cooperation between Japan and the U.S. includes aircraft repairs, missile production and military supply chain resilience, he added.


Japan and the U.S. already build a missile defense interceptor together and Tokyo has also agreed to supply Patriot PAC3 air-defense missiles to the U.S.

That’s up from the current average of about 39 mpg, but less ambitious than the Biden administration’s initial proposal. The final standards for lighter SUVs, pickups, and minivans, as well as heavy-duty pickups and vans, were also watered down. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/07/biden-pulls-back-on-tightened-car-and-truck-fuel-standards-00162297?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tap3MD1jj410Tby1pOMDPKB8nPW0fWipae3z0EoBFUw-KgNPkGOgTzEpTMVpirk_zBOl0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">According to</a> <em><em>Politico</em></em>, the standards in the original proposal would have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by an additional 200 million metric tons through 2050 compared to the standards announced on Friday.</p><h3>3. 1.5 billion people endured extreme heat already this year</h3><p>As we approach the summer equinox in the northern hemisphere, it’s a good time to pause and reflect on the extreme heat events that have already plagued so many people across the world this year. In the first five months of 2024, more than 1.5 billion people experienced at least one day where the heat index reached the life-threatening temperature of 103 degrees Fahrenheit, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/heat-index-temperatures-global-cities/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tap3MD1jj410Tby1pOMDPKB8nPW0fWipae3z0EoBFUw-KgNPkGOgTzEpTMVpirk_zBOl0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to analysis</a> from <em><em>The Washington Post</em></em>. That’s nearly one-fifth of the entire human population on Earth.

Green parties among ‘biggest losers’ in EU parliament elections</h3><p>Early results from the European parliament elections that took place over the last few days show right-wing parties making gains and green parties sitting among the “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/europe/european-union-vote-delivers-shift-to-right-in-blow-to-french-and-german-governments-8f1c0f23?mod=hp_lead_pos&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tap3MD1jj410Tby1pOMDPKB8nPW0fWipae3z0EoBFUw-KgNPkGOgTzEpTMVpirk_zBOl0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">biggest losers</a>.” Obviously this shift could have implications for EU climate law: The bloc has a number of ambitious clean energy and emissions targets in line for 2030, but many green policies (including a planned 2035 phase-out of new gas-powered vehicles) are up for review soon and “a more climate-skeptical EU parliament could attempt to add loopholes to weaken those laws,” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trade-climate-five-takeaways-eu-election-2024-06-09/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tap3MD1jj410Tby1pOMDPKB8nPW0fWipae3z0EoBFUw-KgNPkGOgTzEpTMVpirk_zBOl0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a> <em><em>Reuters</em></em>. The parliament will also help outline new 2040 emissions targets for EU countries, and “that goal will set the course for a future wave of policies to curb emissions in the 2030s in every sector, from farming, to manufacturing, to transport.” Still, the tone remains pretty optimistic. Environment and climate ministers <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uphill-road-europes-climate-plan-after-eu-election-2024-06-10/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tap3MD1jj410Tby1pOMDPKB8nPW0fWipae3z0EoBFUw-KgNPkGOgTzEpTMVpirk_zBOl0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seem to feel</a> that while new climate measures may be hard to sell, backtracking on existing regulations is unlikely.</p><h3>5. Researchers suggest ‘giant viruses’ could help slow melting on Greenland ice sheet</h3><p>Scientists say they’ve discovered signs that giant viruses are living on the Greenland ice sheet, and believe these viruses might be able to help slow melting in the region. The <a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-024-01796-y?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tap3MD1jj410Tby1pOMDPKB8nPW0fWipae3z0EoBFUw-KgNPkGOgTzEpTMVpirk_zBOl0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">findings are</a> preliminary, and many unanswered questions remain, but the theory is that these viruses – which can run <a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-06-giant-viruses-greenland-ice-sheet.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tap3MD1jj410Tby1pOMDPKB8nPW0fWipae3z0EoBFUw-KgNPkGOgTzEpTMVpirk_zBOl0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1,500 times</a> larger than regular viruses – attack a type of algae that turns the Greenland ice and snow black. The darker the ice, the more heat it absorbs, and the faster it melts. If the scientists can prove the viruses attack the algae, perhaps they could be deployed to help control the algae and keep the snow and ice white. It’s a sort of “natural” form of geoengineering, I suppose. It may seem far-fetched, but then again so does <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/06/04/marine-cloud-brightening-geoengineering-alameda/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tap3MD1jj410Tby1pOMDPKB8nPW0fWipae3z0EoBFUw-KgNPkGOgTzEpTMVpirk_zBOl0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">brightening the clouds</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-68206309?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--tap3MD1jj410Tby1pOMDPKB8nPW0fWipae3z0EoBFUw-KgNPkGOgTzEpTMVpirk_zBOl0" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pumping saltwater onto the Arctic</a> sea ice to re-freeze it.

Although Bank of America analysts predicted four years ago that adaptation and resilience could become a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/why-investing-in-climate-adaptation-will-soon-be-very-profitable-green-insight" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2 trillion</u></a> market by 2026, annual investment grew just 28% in 2022 to <a href="https://gca.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/State-and-Trends-in-Climate-Adaptation-Finance-2023_WEB.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$63 billion</u></a>. In that same time, financing for mitigation technologies reached $1.2 trillion.
</p><p>
	The main distinguishing factor between the two approaches to climate tech: Where the money is coming from. While global mitigation spending is generally shared evenly between the public and private sector, <a href="https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>98%</u></a> of adaptation finance comes from the public sector. Without the profit motive to drive down costs, many solutions don’t make financial sense for investors. “Our targeting is better but the cost curve has not been substantially cut,” said Ali Zaidi, the president’s chief climate advisor, at the Innovations in Climate Resilience conference in April. We’ve made progress, he said, but “we haven’t cut it by a factor of four or a factor of eight — that’s the kind of progress we’ve made on mitigation technology, but not in the arena of resilience.”
</p><p>
	Sonam Velani, co-founder of Streetlife Ventures and an early investor in adaptation solutions, told me that, “traditionally, adaptation has been seen as a government problem. But today, more and more businesses are actually coming to solve those solutions.” The new climate <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-31" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disclosure rules</u></a> from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission put further pressure on companies to understand their products’ climate impact. “If you look at a lot of the climate-related disclosures that are now being required,” Velani said, “companies are actually required to understand climate risk and what impact that has on their bottom line,” and making that information public drives accountability.
</p><p>
	In early April, a coalition consisting of the Bezos Earth Fund, the philanthropic ClimateWorks Foundation, impact-focused private equity firm the Lightsmith Group, and MSCI Sustainability Institute issued a new report called “<a href="https://img1.wsimg.com/blobby/go/66c2ce28-dc91-4dc1-a0e1-a47d9ecdc17d/downloads/GARI%202024%20-%20Investing%20in%20Climate%20Resilience%20-%20.pdf?ver=1710422174956" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>The Unavoidable Opportunity</u></a>,” aiming to understand the private sector adaptation opportunity. Jay Koh, Managing Director of the Lightsmith Group, said the title was inspired by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6/wg2/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FullReport.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>own language</u></a> on adaptation. “Climate resilience investments can be made at scale,” the report determined, “including in publicly traded companies.”
</p><p>
	MSCI said its model “builds on existing definitions and approaches to identifying adaptation companies,” including the EU’s taxonomy of sustainable economic activities, then used a large language model to scour companies’ annual reports for products and services that qualified. MSCI considered the companies adaptation and resilience investments only if they were in the business of adaptation, as opposed to simply “taking measures to make their operations more internally resilient.” By that metric, 827 companies, or more than 11% of publicly traded entities in developed markets, could be considered adaptation solutions.
</p><p>
	All these new green opportunities didn’t sprout from thin air. The idea is to push back the “investment frontier” for adaptation — to broaden the classification beyond solely “pure play” companies focused explicitly and exclusively on climate adaptations to include those with multi-use products — and thereby bring in more capital. The same is true in the mitigation market, where examples are more plentiful. Take Siemens, for instance. The German conglomerate that sells everything from healthcare IT to dishwashers; it also happens to be a leader in offshore wind energy. Despite no mention of climate mitigation in Siemens’ mission or sustainability tagline on their homepage, they are still a key player in climate mitigation technologies.
</p><p>
	Katie MacDonald is a co-founder of Tailwind, a research and investment firm focused on accelerating the deployment of climate adaptation and resilience solutions. She told me that “most companies don’t call what they do adaptation or resilience.” In fact, she said, “most of the companies and solutions we’ve spoken to so far don’t call themselves climate change anything — they call themselves risk management or agriculture analytics or supply chain or healthcare diagnostics.”
</p><p>
	The MSCI report sets out a list of qualifiers to help investors better understand what adaptation is, but — crucially — stops short of saying what adaptation <em><em>isn’t</em></em>. Koh explains the thinking. “We think it’s very early in the development of adaptation to consider” excluding any business in particular. “If we would had said early on that decarbonization only means solar panels, then we would have never opened up our minds enough to decarbonize agriculture, transportation, and buildings.”
</p><p>
	While climate impacts will be felt across all areas of the economy, tagging such a wide range of companies as climate adaptation solutions could leave the space vulnerable to greenwashing. The report uses pipes as an example. Pipes are critical for resilience tasks such as stormwater drainage and irrigation. But the same companies also sell pipes oil fields.
</p><p>
	There are existing standards that can help answer these questions. The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals, for example, codified in 2015 at the landmark UN Sustainable Development Summit, provided a framework for organizations to measure their contributions across climate impact areas. There are also more complex metrics such as adaptive capacity, which measures, for instance, how much excess heat a crop can withstand before its yields begin to decline.
</p><p>
	MacDonald told me she can envision other outcome-based metrics, as well. “Whether it’s looking at reduced negative health outcomes and mortality or increased asset health and functionality, there are a myriad of ways we can measure the presence of a climate resilience benefit,” she said.
</p><p>
	The MSCI team hopes the report’s findings can enable investors and portfolio managers to create an investing strategy that encompasses every size of company including seed, venture, growth, and listed equities. Koh emphasizes that investing in adaptation isn’t a matter of wondering what the business models will be or waiting for new startups to appear. The report shows that there’s already an identifiable set of public companies that could make up an investment strategy for your existing 401k, pension plan, or portfolio.
</p><p>
	The point is not merely to recharacterize more investing as adaptation-related, inflating the statistics with no real change in fortune for businesses and governments attempting to fortify themselves against the climate of the future. The point is for private capital to drive demand for solutions that not only prevent immense losses but foster a higher quality of life for billions of people.
</p><p>
“You actually know more right now about how climate change will unfold between now and 2040 than you do about the rate of inflation, interest rates, AI, consumer behavior or the betting odds on who Taylor Swift will be dating next,” Koh told me as he walked through the report’s findings. “We think that leads to an unavoidable opportunity,” though he added a caveat: “I believe these statistics were made before Travis Kelce.”

## Thousands turn out for LA Pride Parade, events

date: 2024-06-10, from: VOA News USA

LOS ANGELES — Tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Hollywood on Sunday for the L.A. Pride Parade, one of the biggest events during a month of celebrations honoring the LGBTQ+ community in and around Los Angeles. 


Rainbow flags ruled the day as revelers cheered the lively procession that featured "Star Trek" star and activist George Takei as the Icon Grand Marshal. 


"As someone who has witnessed the struggles and triumphs of our community over the years, I am filled with gratitude for the progress we have made and inspired to continue the fight for full acceptance and equality for all," Takei said in a statement. 


The parade's Community Grand Marshal was L.A. Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley. The department's first openly gay chief said she was "overjoyed" by the honor. 


Following the parade, the L.A. Pride Block Party offered DJs, live performances, food trucks and a beer garden. 


On Saturday night, Latin pop superstar Ricky Martin headlined a concert dubbed Pride in the Park at Los Angeles State Historic Park. 


Other events scheduled for Pride Month include celebrations at Dodger Stadium and Universal Studios Hollywood.

## US resumes air drops of aid into northern Gaza

date: 2024-06-10, from: VOA News USA

Washington — An American cargo plane dropped more than 10 metric tons of rations into northern Gaza on Sunday, the U.S. military said, after a suspension of such deliveries due to Israeli operations in the area.


Gaza's population is in dire need of humanitarian assistance after eight months of devastating conflict, and the United States turned to delivering it by air and sea as Israel delayed the entry of aid via land.


The air drop provided "life-saving humanitarian assistance in northern Gaza," the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement.


"To date, the U.S. has airdropped more than 1,050 metric tons of humanitarian assistance" in addition to aid delivered via a temporary pier attached to the Gaza coast, it said.


"These airdrops are part of a sustained effort, and we continue to plan follow-on aerial deliveries," CENTCOM added. 


The Pentagon said in late May that factors including Israeli operations and weather conditions were affecting the drops, while deputy CENTCOM commander Vice Admiral Brad Cooper said Friday that they had been "suspended due to the kinetic operations happening in the north" but were expected to resume soon. 


The latest air drop came a day after aid deliveries were restarted via the pier, which was damaged by bad weather last month and had to be repaired in a nearby port before being reattached to the coast. 


Gaza is suffering through its bloodiest-ever war, which broke out after Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,194 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures. 


Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 37,084 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.

## ldap2pg 6.1: Postgres 16 unprivileged, hooks and more

date: 2024-06-10, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><em>Paris, the 3 june 2024.</em></p>
<p>Dalibo provides services, training and support to its clients in France since 2005.</p>
<p>Since 2017, <a href="https://labs.dalibo.com/ldap2pg">ldap2pg</a> offers the best automatic roles and privileges synchronisation solution for PostgreSQL.
Configure PostgreSQL authentication with LDAP in <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file, then use ldap2pg to create and configure roles from your enterprise directory.</p>
<p>Today Dalibo announces the availability of ldap2pg 6.1.
This version brings support for PostgreSQL 16
and its new unprivileged administration or roles.
Numerous compatibility and configurability improvements make this a practical and stable version.
Follow the <a href="https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/">documentation to install</a> this new version.</p>


<h3>Unprivileged execution &amp; Postgres 16</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 16 introduced a major break in compatibility when it comes to delegating the administration of roles
to an unprivileged user.
This change is based on the observation that the previous implementation
offered an illusion of security
and was not consistent with the SQL standard.
Indeed, a user with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option can de facto grant himself rights he does not have.</p>
<p>Also, ldap2pg 6.1 refuses to run without being a superuser on PostgreSQL up to version 15.
ldap2pg 6.1 can run with the <code>CREATEROLE</code> option on PostgreSQL 16,
without superuser privileges.</p>
<h3>Configurability</h3>
<p>ldap2pg 6.1 provides new configuration facilities.
You can now write the environment variables in an <code>.env</code> file alongside the <code>ldap2pg.yml</code> file
or in the ldap2pg working directory.</p>
<p>In the same way as <code>make</code> and <code>git</code> commands,
ldap2pg accepts a <code>-C</code> parameter which determines the working directory of the command.
This parameter determines the search for the <code>ldap2pg.yml</code> and <code>ldaprc</code> configuration files.</p>
<p>Finally, ldap2pg now accepts a command line argument:
the connection string to the PostgreSQL instance to be synchronised.
This connection string can be in URL format or in key=value format.</p>
<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<p>ldap2pg no longer executes the <em>whoami</em> LDAP command after connection to the LDAP directory.
This operation is an extension of the LDAP protocol and is not available everywhere.
Removing this command removes the dependency on the availability of this extension.</p>
<p>The <code>LDAPURI</code> parameter can contain several URIs separated by a space.
If the first URI fails, the LDAP client must try the second.
ldap2pg 6.1 corrects a regression in version 6.0 and restores this client-side HA implementation.</p>
<p>LDAP is a case-insensitive protocol,
only for ASCII characters.
ldap2pg 6.1 is now case insensitive for DN and attribute names.</p>
<h3>Execution hooks</h3>
<p>A very old feature request has just been implemented in ldap2pg :
the definition of an arbitrary SQL command to be executed before or after the creation of a role.
For example, to create a schema specific to a new user.
The <em>role</em> rule now accepts <code>before_create</code> and <code>after_create</code> parameters.
These requests can receive dynamic values from the LDAP search.</p>
<h3>Continue on error</h3>
<p>Some errors should not prevent synchronisation from continuing.
For example, if ldap2pg fails to drop a role still owning objects in base.
ldap2pg 6.1 tolerates up to 8 such synchronisation errors before giving up.</p>
<h3>Other changes</h3>
<p>See more changes, features and fixes in <a href="https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog/#ldap2pg-61">changelog</a>.</p>

## What is PID 0?

date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News

The very short version: Unix PIDs do start at 0! PID 0 just isn’t shown to userspace through traditional APIs. PID 0 starts the kernel, then retires to a quiet life of helping a bit with process scheduling and power management. Also the entire web is mostly wrong about PID 0, because of one sentence on Wikipedia from 16 years ago. There’s a slightly longer short version right at the end, or you can stick with me for the extremely long middle bit! But surely you could just google what PID 0 is, right? Why am I even publishing this? ↫ David Anderson What a great read. Just great.

## Adobe terms clarified: will never own your work, or use it for AI training

date: 2024-06-09, from: OS News

Adobe Creative Cloud users opened their apps yesterday to find that they were forced to agree to new terms, which included some frightening-sounding language. It seemed to suggest Adobe was claiming rights over their work. Worse, there was no way to continue using the apps, to request support to clarify the terms, or even uninstall the apps, without agreeing to the terms. ↫ Ben Lovejoy at 9To5Mac Of course users were going to revolt. Even without the scary-sounding language, locking people out of their applications unless they agree to new terms is a terrible dark pattern, and something a lot of enterprise customers certainly aren&#8217;t going to be particularly happy about. I&#8217;ve never worked an office job, so how does stuff like this normally go? I&#8217;m assuming employees aren&#8217;t allowed to just accept new licensing terms from Adobe or whatever on their office computers? In response to the backlash, Adobe came out and said in a statement that it does not intend to claim ownership over anyone&#8217;s work, and that it&#8217;s not going to train its ML models on customers&#8217; work either. The company states that to train its Firefly ML model, it only uses content it has properly licensed for it, as well as public domain content. Assuming Adobe is telling the truth, it seems the company at least understands the concept of consent, which is good news, and a breath of fresh air compared to crooks like OpenAI or GitHub. Content used for training ML models should be properly licensed for it, and consent should be properly obtained from rightsholders, and taking Adobe at their word, it seems that&#8217;s exactly what they&#8217;re doing. Regardless, the backlash illustrates once again just how &#8211; rightfully &#8211; weary people are of machine learning, and how their works might be illegally appropriated to train such models.

## It's time to get real: I'm not 25 anymore

date: 2024-06-09, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>Last week, without warning, my back went “crunch”.</p><p>I’ve been dealing with what feels like a painful, bruised coccyx ever since. It should heal up within a few weeks, but until then, getting up from a sitting or lying position is really hard, walking has been awkward, and I haven’t been able to pick up anything particularly heavy (like, just for example, a toddler who happens to be in the 99th percentile for his height).</p><p>I’m used to my body more or less working properly — and now it just doesn’t. It’s been unsettling. In the scheme of things, it’s much less problematic than the injuries a lot of people have to deal with, but it’s also a wake-up call.</p><p>Here’s what I think I need to do:</p><ul><li>Commit to radically losing some weight. My weight when I arrived in California was 196 pounds. The last time I weighed in, it was something like 260.</li>
<li>Gain some strength and flexibility. Once my coccyx is healed I intend to start taking home fitness more seriously, and also (finally) get into yoga.</li>
<li>Actually use my fancy standing desk. I need to spend more of my time standing rather than sitting, and aim to stand for at least 60% of my day.</li>
<li>When I <em>am</em> sitting, I need to take my posture seriously. <a href="https://werd.io/2023/my-setup-october-2023">I’ve been sitting on</a> a Wit SitOnIt task chair (the same kind we used to have at Matter), but I need something with more lumbar and posture support. Not least because the back support strip went “ping” a little while ago and I’ve been sitting with almost nothing behind me.</li>
</ul><p>So. Changes afoot:</p><p>I’m upgrading my chair to a <a href="https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-chairs-aeron/aeron-chair/2195348.html?lang=en_US&amp;sku=100073872">Herman Miller Aeron</a>, which is stereotypical for a reason: it’s far better for posture. I managed to find it at a surplus store for a very deep discount on its eye-watering usual price.</p><p>I’ll be standing for most of my day. If you’re in a meeting with me, you can expect me to be bouncing around.</p><p>I’ll be taking more care about what I eat, mostly by trying to go for less calorie-dense food. In a significant change to my California lifestyle, I already don’t eat out much. But there’s more I can do: in particular, the more fresh vegetables I can include, the better.</p><p>I’m going to try and resume my walking habit: a long walk at night, listening to podcasts or audiobooks.</p><p>And yoga. Which I am terrified of. My relationship with my body is fraught. I’ve never been proud of it and I don’t think I can make it do very much. So as challenging as the stretching itself might be, the psychological component is pretty much the hardest thing to get over.</p><p>Unfortunately, I’m not 25 anymore. In itself, that’s a painful sentence to have to type. But here I am, firmly entering middle age, and I want to be around for a long time to come.</p><p>These changes might be challenging — both in themselves and as habits to stick to — but it’s clearly past time that I do something. My painful back is a small signal; without intervention, I expect others to follow. It’s time to get real.</p></div>

## 'Bad Boys: Ride or Die' boosts Will Smith's comeback with $56M opening

date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA

New York — “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” the fourth installment in the Will Smith-Martin Lawrence action-comedy series, opened with an estimated $56 million in theaters over the weekend, handing Hollywood a much-needed summer hit and Smith his biggest success since he slapped Chris Rock at the Academy Awards.


Expectations were all over the map for “Ride or Die” given the dismal moviegoing market thus far this summer and Smith’s less certain box-office clout. In the end, though, the Sony Pictures release came in very close to, or slightly above, its tracking forecast.


“Ride or Die,” produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, is Smith’s first theatrical test since his 2022 slap of Rock earned him a 10-year Oscar ban. The “Bad Boys” film was in development at the time and was momentarily put on hold, but ultimately went forward with about a $100 million production budget.


Smith starred in the Apple release “Emancipation,” but that film — released in late 2022 — was shot before the slap and received only a modest theatrical release before streaming.


This time around, Smith largely avoided soul-searching interviews looking back on the Oscars and instead went on a whistle-stop publicity tour of red carpets from Mexico to Saudi Arabia, where he attended what was billed as the country's first Hollywood premiere. The 55-year-old Smith, who for years was one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, appeared on “The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon," the YouTube series “Hot Ones" and Friday, made a surprise appearance at a Los Angeles movie theater.


Given that “Bad Boys” trailed May disappointments like “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” and “The Fall Guy” – both of which struggled to pop with ticket buyers despite very good reviews – the “Ride or Die” opening counts as a critical weekend win for the movie business.


“The fact that a movie overperformed is the best possible news,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. “It seems like all we’ve been doing over the past few weeks and almost since the beginning of the year, with a couple of exceptions, is try to figure out why seemingly well-marketed, well-reviewed movies have underperformed. This ignites the spark that the industry has been waiting for.”


“Ride or Die” still didn’t quite manage to match the opening of the previous “Bad Boys” film: 2020’s “Bad Boys for Life.” That movie, released in January 2020, debuted with $62.5 million. After the pandemic shut down theaters, it was the highest grossing North American release of that year, with $204 million domestically.


“Ride or Die” added $48.6 million internationally. Though reviews were mixed (64% on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences gave the film a high grade with an “A-” CinemaScore.


Black moviegoers accounted for 44% of ticket buyers, the largest demographic.


In the film, which comes 29 years after the original, Smith and Lawrence reprise their roles as Miami detectives. The plot revolves around uncovering a scheme to frame their late police captain (Joe Pantoliano). In one of the movie's most notable scenes, Lawrence slaps Smith and calls him a “bad boy.”


Movie theaters will need a lot more than “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” though, to right the ship. Ticket sales are down 26% from last year and more than 40% below pre-pandemic totals, according to Comscore. A big test comes next weekend with the release of Pixar’s “Inside Out 2.” After sending several Pixar releases straight to Disney+, the studio has vowed a lengthy, traditional theatrical rollout this time.


Last weekend’s top film “The Garfield Movie,” slid to second place. Also from Sony, the family animated comedy collected $10 million in ticket sales over its third weekend, bringing its domestic gross to $68.6 million.


The weekend's other new wide release, “The Watchers," failed to click with moviegoers. The horror film, directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of M. Night Shyamalan, is about a stranded 28-year-old artist in Ireland. Following poor reviews, the Warner Bros. release grossed $7 million in 3,351 theaters.


That allowed “If,” the Ryan Reynolds imaginary friend fantasy, to grab third place in its fourth weekend of release, bringing the Paramount Pictures cumulative domestic total to $93.5 million. Rounding out the top five was “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” which added $5.4 million in its fifth weekend of release. It has grossed $150 million domestically and $360 million worldwide.


Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.


1. “Bad Boys: Ride or Die,” $56 million.


2. ”The Garfield Movie," $10 million.


3. “If,” $8 million.


4. “The Watchers,” $7 million.


5. “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” $5.4 million.


6. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga,” $4.2 million.


7. “The Fall Guy,” $2.7 million.


8. “Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,” $2.4 million.


9. “Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,” $1.9 million.


10. “The Strangers: Chapter 1,” $1.8 million.

## Mayorkas: Biden administration ready for court challenges to border policy

date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA

Washington — President Joe Biden's administration is prepared to defend in court the sweeping asylum policy put into place at the U.S.-Mexico border last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC's "This Week" on Sunday.


Biden signed an executive order on Tuesday that generally bars migrants who illegally cross the southern border from claiming asylum and allows authorities to quickly deport or send migrants back to Mexico if the daily number of crossings exceeds 2,500. The asylum ban has exceptions for unaccompanied minors, people who face serious medical or safety threats, and victims of trafficking.


Mayorkas on Sunday said the administration was ready to defend the policy against an expected American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) lawsuit.


"I respectfully disagree with the ACLU," Mayorkas said. "We stand by the legality of what we have done. We stand by the value proposition. It's not only a matter of securing the border, we have a humanitarian obligation to keep vulnerable people out of the hands of exploitative smugglers."


The ACLU confirmed on Sunday it plans to sue.


"It was illegal when Trump did it, and it is no less illegal now," ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project Deputy Director Lee Gelernt said in a statement.


Biden took office in 2021 vowing to reverse some of Republican Donald Trump's restrictive policies but has grappled with record levels of migrants caught crossing the border illegally ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election.


Mayorkas said initial indications showed the new policy was deterring some illegal immigration.


"It's early. The signs are positive," he said.


A U.S. border official told Reuters that authorities arrested around 3,100 people crossing illegally on Friday, down roughly 20% from the days before. The official requested anonymity to discuss preliminary figures.


Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who installed razor wire fencing along the Rio Grande and has seen a state law to enforce illegal crossings into his state blocked by a judge, told Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" he thinks the policy is backfiring.


"All that this new Biden policy is going to do is to actually attract and invite even more people to cross the border illegally," Abbott said.

## Large chunk of Wyoming's Teton Pass road collapses; unclear how quickly it can be rebuilt

date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA

JACKSON, Wyo.  — A large chunk of a twisting mountain pass road collapsed in Wyoming, authorities said Saturday, leaving a gaping chasm in the highway and severing a well-traveled commuter link between small towns in eastern Idaho and the tourist destination of Jackson.  


Aerial photos and drone video of the collapse show the Teton Pass road riven with deep cracks, and a big section of the pavement disappeared altogether. Part of the guardrail dangled into the void, and orange traffic drums marked off the danger area. The road was closed at the time of the collapse.  


The section that failed first drew attention Thursday when a crack and drop in the road contributed to the crash of a motorcycle.  


Geologists and engineers who were sent to the area that day noticed “that crack and that drop started to move a lot,” said Stephanie Harsha, a spokesperson for District 3 of the Wyoming Department of Transportation. A paving crew temporarily patched the road, and traffic began moving again that night.   


But that was short-lived as maintenance crews were sent to respond to a mudslide a couple of miles away in the pre-dawn hours of Friday, prompting the road to be closed once again.  


Crews then noticed that the damage to the pavement had become more pronounced. Workers trying to figure out a detour around that section left for the night, “and by 5 a.m., this morning, WYDOT had discovered that the road had completely failed,” Harsha said Saturday.  


“We were very, very lucky that no crews were harmed. No equipment was damaged,” she said. “So now, engineers and geologists are doing geological assessments on the pass. They’ve been looking at it all day.”  


The transportation department said via social media that the road “catastrophically failed” at milepost 12.8.  


It was not immediately clear how long it will take to reopen the road, a vital artery for people who live across the border in Idaho and work in pricey Jackson, which is also close to the popular Grand Teton National Park.  


Harsha said an alternate route between Jackson and the area of Victor, Idaho, goes more than 60 miles (97 kilometers) out of the way and adds “quite a bit to any commute.”  


Gov. Mark Gordon signed an executive order declaring an emergency, which his office said would help the state access additional resources from the Federal Highway Administration to begin repair work.  


In a statement, the governor said the transportation department is working on “a long-term solution to rebuild this critical roadway.”  


“I recognize the significant impacts this closure has to Teton County residents, regional commuters and the local economy,” Gordon said.

## Biden honors US war dead with cemetery visit ending French trip

date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA

BELLEAU, France  — President Joe Biden closed out his trip to France by paying his respects at an American military cemetery that Donald Trump notably skipped visiting when he was president, hoping his final stop Sunday will draw the stakes of the November election in stark relief.


Before returning to the United States, Biden honored America's war dead at Aisne-Marne American Cemetery about an hour outside Paris. He placed a wreath at the cemetery chapel before an expanse of white headstones marking the final resting place of more than 2,200 U.S. soldiers who fought in World War I.




It was a solemn end to five days in which Trump was an unspoken yet unavoidable presence. On the surface, the trip marked the 80th anniversary of D-Day and celebrated the alliance between the United States and France. But during an election year when Trump has called into question fundamental understandings about America's global role, Biden has embraced his Republican predecessor — and would-be successor — as a latent foil.




Every ode to the transatlantic partnership was a reminder that Trump could upend those relationships. Each reference to democracy stood a counterpoint to his rival's efforts to overturn a presidential election. The myriad exhortations to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia created a contrast with Trump's skepticism about providing U.S. assistance.


Biden's paeans to the struggle between democracy and autocracy drew plaudits in Europe, where the prospect of a return to Trump's turbulent reign has sparked no shortage of anxiety. But it remains to be seen how the message will resonate with American voters, as Biden's campaign struggles to connect the dire warnings the Democratic president so often delivers about his rival with people's daily concerns.


The visit to the cemetery served as a moment to underscore the contrast once more.


"It's the same story," Biden said. "America showed up. America showed up to stop the Germans. America showed up to make sure that they did not prevail. And America shows up when we're needed just like our allies show for us."




During a 2018 trip to France, Trump skipped plans to go to the cemetery, a decision that the White House blamed on weather at the time. However, subsequent reports said that Trump told aides he didn't want to go because he viewed the dead soldiers as "suckers" and "losers." Trump has denied the comments, although they were later corroborated by his chief of staff at the time, John Kelly.


Trump's purported insults have become a regular feature of Biden's campaign speeches, including during an April rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania.


"These soldiers were heroes, just as every American who has served this nation," Biden said. "Believing otherwise, that alone is disqualifying for someone to seek this office."


Biden ignored a direct question about Trump at the cemetery. "The idea that I would come to Normandy and not make the short trip here to pay tribute," he added, his voice trailing off as if to express disbelief.


Maura Sullivan, a former Marine officer who served on the American Battle Monuments Commission under President Barack Obama, said Biden's visit would "set the example, and do what a president should do." Now an official with the New Hampshire Democratic Party, Sullivan said that "voters can draw their own conclusions" from that.


Biden's trip was full of emotional moments, and the president grew heavy-eyed after meeting with World War II veterans. A 21-gun salute cast eerie smoke over 9,388 white marble headstones at the Normandy American Cemetery.


"This has been the most remarkable trip that I've ever made," Biden said on Saturday night, his last in Paris before returning to the U.S.




At Aisne-Marne, Biden said the trip "surprised me how much it awakened my sense of why it's so valuable to have these alliances. Why it's so critical. That's the way you stop wars, not start wars."


His remarks over the last few days were also freighted with political overtones.


On Thursday at Normandy anniversary ceremonies, Biden said D-Day served a reminder that alliances make the United States stronger, calling it "a lesson that I pray we Americans never forget." He also highlighted how the war effort drew on immigrants, women and people of color who were too often overlooked by history.


Then on Friday, he went to Pointe du Hoc, a spot on the coast where Army Rangers scaled cliffs to overcome Nazi defenses on D-Day that was also the site in 1984 of one of President Ronald Reagan's most memorable speeches about the struggles between the West and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.


By following in an iconic Republican's footsteps, Biden honed his appeal to traditional conservatives who are often frustrated by Trump's isolationist vision. Biden issued a call for Americans to protect democracy like the Rangers who scaled the cliffs, a message that synced with campaign rhetoric that paints his election opponent as an existential threat to U.S. values.


While Biden was in France, his campaign announced that it had hired the onetime chief of staff to former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger to lead outreach to GOP voters. Kinzinger clashed with Trump's foreign policy and efforts to overturn the last presidential election.


At Pointe du Hoc, Biden said the Army Rangers "fought to vanquish a hateful ideology in the '30s and '40s. Does anyone doubt they wouldn't move heaven and earth to vanquish hateful ideologies of today?"


Trump has argued that the U.S. needs to devote more attention to its own problems and less to foreign alliances and entanglements. He has also routinely played down the importance of American partnerships, suggesting the U.S. could abandon its treaty commitments to defend European allies if they don't pay enough for their own defenses.


Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian who wrote a book about Pointe du Hoc and Reagan's speech, said Biden "had big shoes to step into" by choosing the same location.


Biden's speech "didn't equal Reagan's in grandeur, nor could it," Brinkley said. Still, he said Biden "said the right words about why democracy matters."


Paul Begala, a veteran Democratic strategist, said it could help Biden politically "to stand where Reagan stood."


He noted that Biden is struggling with younger voters but appears to be gaining strength among older ones who may be more receptive to reminders of Reagan's speech four decades ago.


"He needs a lot of Reagan Republicans to offset his challenges with younger voters," he said.


Biden's trip was also punctuated by the pomp of a state visit in Paris.


French President Emmanuel Macron arranged a ceremony at the Arc du Triomphe, where four fighter jets flew overhead, and hosted a banquet at the Elysee presidential palace.


"United we stand, divided we fall," Macron said in toasting Biden. "Allied we are, and allied we will stay."


Overall, Biden's visit had a slower pace than other foreign trips. The 81-year-old president had no public events on his first day in Paris after arriving on an overnight flight, and didn't hold a press conference with reporters, as is customary. John Kirby, a national security spokesman, said that was necessary to prepare "in advance of the weighty engagements" during subsequent days.


"There's a lot on the calendar," he said.


Still, it was a contrast to Macron's tendency to offer prestigious guests an intense schedule with a mix of official meetings, business talks, cultural events and private dinners at fancy restaurants.


When the 46-year-old French leader hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping last month, the two-day agenda was crammed with activities including a trip to the Pyrenees Mountains near the border with Spain where Macron spent time as a child.

## Review of Technical Writing for Software Developers

date: 2024-06-09, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

Just around the time I was complaining about the scarcity of books on technical writing, I got a copy of Technical Writing for Software Developers by Chris Chinchilla, a regular of the Write the Docs community. Delighted by the chance of reading a book from one of the sharpest pens in technical writing, I set aside some time to read through the nine chapters and write a review. The book taught me little I didn’t already know – Chris and I use the same tools and methods.

## Washington state pioneers program to turn inmates into wildland firefighters

date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA

Spokane, Washington — The inmates of Washington state's prison system tramp through the forest, their yellow uniforms and helmets bright against the brown branches and green leaves.  


They are Arcadia 20, or ARC 20, an elite group of firefighters based in Spokane who have been recruited from existing firefighting prison camps.  


The aim? Teach the inmates the skills needed to help prevent forest fires - and in the process, give them an opportunity to start on a path to a new career.  


Recruited by the state's Department of Natural Resources and Department of Corrections, the program seeks to provide the dozen or so inmates with enough training to prepare them for jobs as civilian firefighters once they have completed their sentences.  


"I do believe one thing for sure, that people deserve a second chance," said Kenyatta Bridges, 34, who joined the ARC 20 team for training in the middle of last year while serving a 10-year sentence for manslaughter in a 2014 gang-affiliated shooting in Pasco, Washington.  


Bridges started a job in a civilian fire crew on June 3, following his release.  


Reuters was granted exclusive access to ARC 20 over three months, including a visit last August to the Tonasket Rodeo Grounds, a rural community in northeast Washington near the Canadian border. Bridges and the ARC 20 crew were setting up their tents after a day of helping contain a fire.


Crew members learn how to conduct prescribed burns, how to handle dangerous equipment, and how to ensure fires that have been contained stay that way. And when necessary, they are on the front lines of a fire, digging lines to help reduce the chance a fire will continue to spread.


"Team work, communications skills, an accountability for one's actions and others as it relates to duties and providing for safety" are an integral part of their mindset, according to ARC 20 management.  


"The fellas that I've worked shoulder to shoulder with, they're amazing," Bridges said. "We all made bad decisions in our life. Some of us got caught, some of us didn't. But we learn from our mistakes."




Earning ability


While states across the American West have inmate firefighting crews, Washington's ARC 20 program is the only one of its kind in the U.S., recruiting incarcerated individuals from full confinement into a reentry center where they continue to build skills in firefighting and prepare for life after release.  


They also earn more. Inmates in Washington state's regular prison firefighting camps, who number around 230, are paid up to $1.50 per hour, based on experience, for their daily duties. When dispatched to an active fire zone, they are paid the state's minimum wage of $16.28 per hour plus overtime.  


Elite crew members who have joined the ARC 20 team are paid a base salary of up to $3,796 per month with potential overtime pay on fire assignments. This year-round crew has a maximum of 20 team members.  


It had 13 people on the team during its first full year in 2023 and expects to have 12 as Washington state's fire season ramps up at the end of June.


The Pacific Northwest is struggling with the effects of climate change, with higher-than-normal chances of wildfires and a longer season this year, according to meteorologists at the Department of Natural Resources, the state agency charged with wildfire prevention and management.  


According to DNR officials who manage both fully incarcerated camp crews and the ARC 20 team, a high-earning member of the camp crew received approximately $11,000 in 2023, whereas an ARC 20 crew member earned up to $60,000.  


The ARC 20 team is trained to join "hand crews" — teams of 18 to 25 firefighters who work and camp near the front lines of active wildfires, often hiking long distances and carrying their own gear to reach remote areas. They also conduct prescribed burns and chainsaw trees to the ground as part of the state's fire mitigation and forest management efforts.


ARC 20's crew superintendent Ben Hood is on the team that selects participants.


"We call it getting bit with the fire bug... Once you get bit with it, you're hooked in," said Hood. "It becomes part of, kind of who you are, becomes more than just a job. It kind of becomes a lifestyle."  


When the team isn't traveling the state fighting fires, they are housed at Brownstone Reentry Center, a minimum security facility in downtown Spokane. Residents participate in work or training programs and are granted additional freedoms like wearing normal clothes or owning a cellphone.  


ARC 20 crew members are paid higher wages than some staff in the state's correctional system, including the facility where they live, according to Brownstone's manager.




Running a kitchen


Reuters visited another crew of fully incarcerated individuals in September at a Department of Natural Resources facility at Cedar Creek Corrections Center, southwest of the state's capital city, Olympia.  


They had just returned from a weeks-long assignment running a mobile kitchen for almost 1,000 wildland firefighters per day, who were fighting two of the 2023 season's biggest fires in the state.  


Timothy Bullock, 32, an electrician jailed for second-degree assault stemming from a domestic dispute, said he has changed his life goals and wants to become a wildland firefighter.


"I used to drink quite a bit... it was a terrible mistake on my part that affected other people, people I cared about. So it's hard dealing with that," said Bullock, acknowledging a prison sentence may have been needed for him to change his path. "I just know that I'm never going to make those types of mistakes ever again."  


Bullock has been a standout member of the Cedar Creek Corrections Center camp crew, according to his bosses at DNR. He has submitted his application for ARC 20 and is being considered for a spot in late 2024.


"I'm getting real close to getting out. It's kind of working out for the better, you know, to get back on my feet and then have an opportunity when I get out," said Bullock.


Washington's model could be a 'stepping stone' for state agencies across the U.S., according to transition crew liaison Roy Hardin, who helped form the crew with Hood.  


"If a person is employed, has a really good job right when they get out of prison, they're not homeless, they're probably not going to come back," said Hardin. He said four crew members from ARC 20 have gone on to take jobs as members of the state firefighting agency – one engine leader and three engine crew members.  


Kenyatta Bridges is one of those crew members.  


On June 3, he started fighting fires with DNR's Arcadia Engine 7405 near Spokane, in one of the most wildfire prone areas of Washington state.  


"He's hard working. He's motivated," said superintendent Hood, who recruited Bridges. "He's becoming one of those leaders. He's good with the chainsaw. He doesn't know how to quit working; he's physically capable of the job. He's what you want in a firefighter."


Bridges is elated for this new chapter of his life. Since his release from Brownstone he has been living in transitional housing with other formerly incarcerated individuals in Spokane, and on May 20 his partner gave birth to their son.  


"I feel like I couldn't ask for nothing better," Bridges said, discussing his life post-release. "To have everything so quickly, it feels like every gear is rotating and spinning just on point."

## Some US families opt to raise teens sans social media

date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA

WESTPORT, Connecticut — Kate Bulkeley's pledge to stay off social media in high school worked at first. She watched the benefits pile up: She was getting excellent grades. She read lots of books. The family had lively conversations around the dinner table and gathered for movie nights on weekends.


Then, as sophomore year got under way, the unexpected problems surfaced. She missed a student government meeting arranged on Snapchat. Her Model U.N. team communicates on social media, too, causing her scheduling problems. Even the Bible Study club at her Connecticut high school uses Instagram to communicate with members.


Gabriela Durham, a high school senior in Brooklyn, says navigating high school without social media has made her who she is today. She is a focused, organized, straight-A student. Not having social media has made her an "outsider," in some ways. That used to hurt; now, she says, it feels like a badge of honor.


With the damaging consequences of social media increasingly well documented, many parents are trying to raise their children with restrictions or blanket bans. Teenagers themselves are aware that too much social media is bad for them, and some are initiating social media "cleanses" because of the toll it takes on mental health and grades.


This is a tale of two families, social media and the ever-present challenge of navigating high school. It's about what kids do when they can't extend their Snapstreaks or shut their bedroom doors and scroll through TikToks past midnight. It's about what families discuss when they're not having screen-time battles. It's also about persistent social ramifications.


The journeys of both families show the rewards and pitfalls of trying to avoid social media in a world that is saturated by it.


Concerns about children and phone use are not new. But there is a growing realization among experts that the COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the relationship kids have with social media. As youth coped with isolation and spent excessive time online, the pandemic effectively carved out a much larger space for social media in the lives of American children.


Social media is where many kids turn to forge their emerging identities, to seek advice, to unwind and relieve stress. In this era of parental control apps and location tracking, social media is where this generation is finding freedom.


It is also increasingly clear that the more time youth spend online, the higher the risk of mental health problems.


Kids who use social media for more than three hours a day face double the risk of depression and anxiety, according to studies cited by U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who issued an extraordinary public warning last spring about the risks of social media to young people.




The Bulkeleys and Gabriela's mother, Elena Romero, both set strict rules starting when their kids were young and still in elementary school. They delayed giving phones until middle school and declared no social media until 18. They educated the girls, and their younger siblings, on the impact of social media on young brains, on online privacy concerns, on the dangers of posting photos or comments that can come back to haunt you.


At school, on the subway and at dance classes around New York City, Gabriela is surrounded by reminders that social media is everywhere — except on her phone.


Growing up without it has meant missing out on things. Everyone but you gets the same jokes, practices the same TikTok dances, is up on the latest viral trends. When Gabriela was younger, that felt isolating; at times, it still does. But now, she sees not having social media as freeing.


"From my perspective, as an outsider," she says, "it seems like a lot of kids use social media to promote a facade. And it's really sad."


There is also friend drama on social media and a lack of honesty, humility and kindness that she feels lucky to be removed from.


Gabriela is a dance major at the Brooklyn High School of the Arts. Senior year got intense with college and scholarship applications capped by getting to perform at Broadway's Shubert Theatre in March as part of a city showcase of high school musicals.


"My kids' schedules will make your head spin," Romero says. On school days, they're up at 5:30 a.m. and out the door by 7. Romero drives the girls to their three schools scattered around Brooklyn, then takes the subway into Manhattan, where she teaches mass communications at the Fashion Institute of Technology.


In New York City, it's common for kids to get phones early in elementary school, but Romero waited until each daughter reached middle school and started taking public transportation home alone.


In the upscale suburb of Westport, Connecticut, the Bulkeleys have faced questions about bending their rules. But not for the reason they had anticipated.


Kate was perfectly content to not have social media. Her parents figured at some point she might resist their ban because of peer pressure or fear of missing out. But the 15-year-old sees it as a waste of time. She describes herself as academic, introverted and focused on building up extracurricular activities.


That's why she needed Instagram.


"I needed it to be co-president of my Bible Study Club," Kate explains.


As Kate's sophomore year started, she told her parents that she was excited to be leading a variety of clubs but needed social media to do her job. "It was the school that really drove the fact that we had to reconsider our rule about no social media," says Steph Bulkeley, Kate's mother.


Schools talk the talk about limiting screen time and the dangers of social media, says her dad, Russ Bulkeley. But technology is rapidly becoming part of the school day. Kate's high school and their 13-year-old daughter Sutton's middle school have cell phone bans that aren't enforced. Teachers will ask them to take out their phones to photograph material during class time.


The Bulkeleys aren't on board with that but feel powerless to change it.


Ultimately they gave in to Kate's plea for Instagram because they trust her, and because she's too busy to devote much time to social media.

## Netflix's recipe for success includes 'secret sauce' spiced with tech savvy

date: 2024-06-09, from: VOA News USA

LOS GATOS, California — Although its video streaming service sparkles with a Hollywood sheen, Netflix still taps its roots in Silicon Valley to stay a step ahead of traditional TV and movie studios.


The Los Gatos, California, company, based more than 300 miles away from Hollywood, frequently reaches into its technological toolbox without viewers even realizing it. It often just uses a few subtle twists on the knobs of viewer recommendations to help keep its 270 million worldwide subscribers satisfied at a time when most of its streaming rivals are seeing waves of cancelations from inflation-weary subscribers.


Even when hit TV series like “The Crown” or “Bridgerton” have wide appeal, Netflix still tries to cater to the divergent tastes of its vast audience. One part of that recipe includes tailoring summaries and trailers about its smorgasbord of shows to fit the personal interests of each viewer.


So, someone who likes romance might see a plot summary or video trailer for “The Crown” highlighting the relationship between Princess Diana and Charles, while another viewer more into political intrigue may be shown a clip of Queen Elizabeth in a meeting with Margaret Thatcher.


For an Oscar-nominated film like “Nyad,” a lover of action might see a trailer of the title character immersed in water during one of her epic swims, while a comedy fan might see a lighthearted scene featuring some amusing banter between the two stars, Annette Bening and Jodie Foster.


Netflix is able to pull off these variations through the deep understanding of viewing habits it gleans from crunching the data from subscribers' histories with its service — including those of customers who signed up in the late 1990s when the company launched with a DVD-by-mail service that continued to operate until last September.


“It is a secret sauce for us, no doubt,” Eunice Kim, Netflix's chief product officer, said while discussing the nuances of the ways Netflix tries to reel different viewers into watching different shows. “The North Star we have every day is keep people engaged, but also make sure they are incredibly satisfied with their viewing experiences.”


As part of that effort, Netflix is rolling out a redesign of the home page that greets subscribers when they are watching the streaming service on a TV screen. The changes are meant to package all the information that might appeal to a subscriber's tastes in a more concise format to reduce the “gymnastics with their eyes,” said Patrick Flemming, Netflix's senior director of member product.


What Netflix is doing with its previews may seem like a small thing, but it can make a huge difference, especially as people looking to save money start to limit the number of streaming services they have.


Last year, video streaming services collectively suffered about 140 million account cancelations, a 35% increase from 2022 and nearly triple the volume in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic created a boom in demand for entertainment from people corralled at home, according to numbers compiled by the research firm Antenna.


Netflix doesn't disclose its cancelation, or churn rate, but last year its streaming service gained 30 million subscribers — marking its second-biggest annual increase behind its own growth spurt during the 2020 pandemic lockdowns.


Part of last year's subscription growth flowed from a crackdown on viewers who had been freeloading off Netflix subscribers who shared their account passwords. But the company is also benefiting from the technological know-how that helps it to keep funneling shows to customers who like them and make them think the service is worth the money, according to J. Christopher Hamilton, an assistant professor of television, radio and film at Syracuse University.


“What they have been doing is pretty ingenious and very, very strategic,” Hamilton said. “They are definitely ahead of the legacy media companies who are trying to do some of the same things but just don’t have the level of sophistication, experience nor the history of the data in their archives.”


Netflix's nerdy heritage once was mocked by an entertainment industry that looked down at the company's geekdom.


Not long after that put-down, Netflix began mining its viewing data to figure out how to produce a slate of original programming that would attract more subscribers — an ambitious expansion that forced Time Warner (now rolled into Warner Bros. Discovery) and other long-established entertainment companies such as Walt Disney Co. into a mad scramble to build their own streaming services.


Although those expansions initially attracted hordes of subscribers, they also resulted in massive losses that have resulted in management shakeups and drastic cutbacks, including the abrupt closure of a CNN streaming service. 


What Netflix is doing with technology to retain subscribers to boost its fortunes — the company's profit rose 20% to $5.4 billion last year — now is widening the divide with rival services still trying to stanch their losses.


Disney's 4-year-old streaming service recently became profitable after an overhaul engineered by CEO Bob Iger, but he thinks more work will be required to catch up with Netflix.


Netflix isn't going to help its rivals by divulging its secrets, but the slicing and dicing generally starts with getting a grasp on which viewers tend to gravitate to certain genres — the broad categories include action, adventure, anime, fantasy, drama, horror, comedy, romance and documentary — and then diving deeper from there.


In some instances, Netflix's technology will even try to divine a viewer's mood at any given time by analyzing what titles are being browsed or clicked on. In other instances, it's relatively easy for the technology to figure out how to make a film or TV series as appealing as possible to specific viewers.


If Netflix's data shows a subscriber has watched a lot of Hindi productions, it would be almost a no-brainer to feature clips of Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt in a role she played in the U.S. film, “Heart of Stone” instead of the movie's lead actress, Gal Gadot.

## LCA software: exit the matrix

date: 2024-06-09, from: Max Halford Blog

Measuring the environmental impact of a product is done using life cycle assessment (LCA). This is a methodology that breaks down a product&rsquo;s life cycle into stages (LCI), and measures the impact of each stage on the environment (LCIA).
There are a few pieces of LCA software to choose from. The leading ones are SimaPro, GaBi, openLCA, and Umberto. These are all proprietary software, and they&rsquo;re expensive. But there&rsquo;s a free and open source alternative: Brightway.
