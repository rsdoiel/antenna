## It’s About Time Our Government Finally Reflects the Real America—An Airport Terminal at 10 a.m. on a Weekday

date: 2025-01-17, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Finally, and not a moment too soon, our government will look, smell, and act like the <i>real</i> America. Not an Ivy League college campus, not a melting pot of immigrants striving to achieve the American dream, but instead an endlessly replenishing stream of shout-talking men outraged that people with disabilities or families with children who are offered extra assistance actually take it, along with a steady diet of morning beers, explosive rage, and ketchup.</p> <p>It&#8217;s far past time for those who “govern” to demonstrate the same lack of awareness as everyone pretending not to know what boarding group they’re in. And why did we win January 6 if not for the right to berate underpaid service workers who aren’t allowed to unionize and also so we can have both pizza and tequila shots for breakfast? Why was 9/11 an inside job if not for our hard-won ability to wear pajama bottoms and inflatable neck pillows in public and constantly have to relearn through the application of loud buzzing sounds and shame that jewelry is made of metal? And what was the whole point of all those genocides if not to have unlimited access to themed socks and overpriced regional T-shirts?</p> <p>Why did we win some wars if not to one day step on a slow-moving rubbery walkway that will just bring us to a place in the small distance that’s not even better, just a little bit closer to the end? Why did we violate a whole bunch of human rights stuff if not to look down on anyone who doesn’t have <span class="caps">TSA</span> pre-check as well as those who do? What is the point of taking over Greenland and the Panama Canal?</p> <p>I’m genuinely asking.</p> <p>What is our military fighting for other than to one day have access to basic health care, suicide prevention, addiction treatment, <span class="caps">PTSD</span> treatment, disability assistance, financial stability, mental health services, homelessness prevention, treatment for military sexual trauma, and thorough investigations into the toxins, trauma, and brain injuries suffered during their service to our country, and I totally forgot the point I was trying to make.</p> <p>Right, the point is, it’s far past time for the physical and behavioral aspects of our government, not to mention the basic filth level and daily aromatic je ne sais quois to more closely reflect the combination <i>Wolf of Wall Street</i> / itinerant carnival / Klan rally that is now the actual true American experience. Join us at gate D4, now E24, now B28, now A287&#8212;whoops, now back to D4 via a shuttle and infrastructure constructed in a previous century. Come jump into a sauce packet of patriotism, get ready to guzzle the cloying artificial syrup of selfishness, and crack open a can of frozen concentrate brimming with public toenail clippings, open-mouth coughing, and watching marriages unravel before your eyes.</p> <p>Do you smell that? That’s freedom. Also, caramel corn and farts.</p> <p>Real democracy is now ready to board. Are you a <i>real</i> American or not? Do you not have the slightest clue how to go through security after twenty-four fucking years? Are you just waiting for someone to act up so you can duct tape them to their seat? Do you hear that other people have tight connections, and if we all just sat down and gave them time to grab their bags and deboard first, they might have a chance of making their connections and think, “Fuck that shit”? Are you itching to ask every non-white person you see where they’re really from, and so help you god, if they answer “Kansas,” you will seriously lose it? And do you often think about how there doesn’t seem to be nearly enough exit rows for everyone who wants out?</p> <p>May God and air traffic control bless our new president, because obviously the billionaires already have. And may someone—truly we’ve proven we’ll take literally anyone—bless the United States of America, a country that has never been more terminal, where the skies have never been less friendly, where you are not free to get up and move across state borders with that uterus of yours, and where the doors are definitely about to fall off.</p>

## A Pre-Game Pep Talk by a College Football Coach Who Recently Audited a Class on Nietzschean Thought

date: 2025-01-17, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p>Team, tonight we play the biggest game of our lives. I know you have heard our opposing coach’s comments&#8212;“We&#8217;re doing everything we can to honor our creator.” I also know you saw last week when their star quarterback took a knee and grabbed the sideline reporter&#8217;s microphone so the world could hear his prayer:</p> <p style="padding-left:2em;"><i>Our father, who art in heaven<br /> I throw this ball for you<br /> Please grant me touchdowns<br /> And deliver me from interceptions<br /> All glory to you, God<br /> And to State, the greatest team in your creation<br /> Amen.</i></p> <p>Now, you&#8217;re probably thinking, &#8220;This ain’t good, Coach. They’re convinced they have the Almighty on their side. If that’s true, what chance do we have? How are we going to beat both State <i>and</i> the God of Western Christianity?&#8221;</p> <p>Well, men, I recently completed my audit of <span class="caps">PHIL</span> 332: Nietzsche &amp; The Death of Practical Meaning, and I’m tired of mincing words.</p> <p>Their God is dead.</p> <p>Time of death: tonight.</p> <p>Place of death: Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.</p> <p>Causes of death: the ceaseless march of modernity, the dawn of an age of existential crises, the fatal annoyance of having to endlessly answer the prayers of State’s performatively evangelical offensive linemen, and our explosive passing attack.</p> <p>When we take the field, we will do what we know how to do. We are going to get pressure on the quarterback. We are going to execute great downfield blocking. And we are going to show State University that Christian morality is by no means self-evident.</p> <p>We will engage State in a practical philosophical thought experiment that proves an unblocked corner blitz can shatter the idea of God. We will offer definitive evidence that no man has the moral high ground in a two-minute drill. We will teach our gospel: the gospel of deep crossing routes that break the necessary assumptions of Christianity, leaving State&#8217;s hands grasping at air, empty and faithless.</p> <p>Come halftime, State&#8217;s coach will stare dead-eyed into the camera, a man whose table has lost three of its four legs. Holly Rowe will ask him, “Coach, what adjustments will help your team get back on track?”</p> <p>He will respond in a whisper: “They are die Übermenschen.”</p> <p>We are the Overmen, the Supermen, the dadgum Tech Cougars, those who have crossed from mindless acceptance to a world of self-directed, restless solitude in pursuit of a grounded human ideal.</p> <p>Our opponent lives, though they do not yet know it, in the twilight of their idols—specifically, the false idols of ground-and-pound, line-of-scrimmage-obsessed football. We require no idols. We have been reborn via our newly installed flea flicker, which reflects our belief in the quintessence of man. We require no moral code. Our defensive coordinator is neither good nor evil. Three-man front or four-man front? Neither and both. We are beyond scheme. Our opponent will live in an infinite loop of eternal recurrence, an unchanging eternity of us Cougars gaining first downs on jet sweeps forever.</p> <p>We do know that our victory will be meaningless. As soon as it is over, it will mean no more than the act of eating an English muffin at the team buffet. Our win will be as worthless as the paper money society has denominated as value, although it is valueless. Our &#8220;National Title&#8221; will be as meaningful as the drunkard’s boast that he is heir to the throne of England. Because he is, and he is not, just as we are, and we are not.</p> <p>Yet this does not change what we do tonight.</p> <p>Tonight, we won&#8217;t rely on faith or intelligent design. Tonight, we won&#8217;t pray for victory. Tonight, we won&#8217;t supplicate to a higher power. No, tonight, we are accountable for what happens, and what is going to happen is that we are going to kick State’s ass up and down the field.</p> <p>We will score touchdowns and have the player who scored lie down while the rest of us pantomime throwing dirt on him, representing the burial of the ancient gods, now sacrificed to progress, science, and our air raid passing offense.</p> <p>We will play clean in coverage, bat passes down, point toward the heavens, and then point at our butts, indicating that their dead God is butt at football.</p> <p>We will stand victorious at the podium with Holly Rowe. She will ask us how we feel, and we will say, without embarrassment, that we feel as gods must feel. That WE <span class="caps">ARE</span> gods. The Gods of Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.</p> <p>Hands in, gentlemen. Clear eyes, full hearts, Zarathustra can&#8217;t lose.</p>

## This mini ITX NAS board with up to Intel Core 3 N355 has four 2.5 GbE LAN ports, 6 SATA connectors, and two M.2 2280 slots

date: 2025-01-16, from: Liliputing

<p>Intel&#8217;s new Twin Lake processors are basically Alder Lake-N chips with support for slightly higher CPU and GPU frequencies.

## The Biggest Problem Threatening Our Country Is an App That Brings People Together

date: 2025-01-16, from: McSweeney's Internet Tendency

<p><i>&#8220;TikTok is still three days away from a likely ban in the United States, but many users are already bidding the app farewell and seeking out alternatives.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/16/tech/tiktok-ban-alternative-apps/index.html"><span class="caps">CNN</span></a></i></p> <div class='break'>- - -</div><p>Everything in the United States was fine until TikTok came along. Before 2016, our country had practically zero problems. But in 2018, TikTok became the most downloaded app in the United States, and that’s when all the problems really began.</p> <p>Sure, TikTok has some real problems, like the Chinese government accessing millions of Americans’ data. But who are we kidding? Our government already does that. We’re mostly just jealous that they thought of it before we did. No, the real problem with TikTok, and the real reason we have no choice but to ban the app entirely, is that it’s bringing Americans together.</p> <p>It’s no secret that we live in divisive times. Friendships end over politics, and families stop talking to each other because one sibling becomes a full-blown QAnon conspiracy theorist. People are protesting in the streets, Los Angeles is on fire, and we have to deal with another four years of Stephen Miller looking like he just ate a baby.</p> <p>Nothing makes sense anymore, and no one can seem to agree on anything. We can’t even agree on objective facts anymore. People on Facebook comment “Wishing them a long and happy life together” on an AI-generated photo of Kim Jong Un making out with Katy Perry. Others are falling in love with ChatGPT boyfriends. Elon Musk is about to be running the government. It’s surprising we don’t seem more concerned about that, isn’t it?</p> <p>But a few times a day, we log onto TikTok and forget the things that divide us. Instead of arguing constantly, Americans come together over TikTok’s steam cleaners, which are definitely not as effective when they show up at your door. We visit the wonderful world of Floptropica, where life feels a little easier. We listen to the same audio eighty-seven times and watch all forty-something clips of “Who TF Did I Marry?” We look for a finance man, and we eat girl dinner.</p> <p>There are a million and one more ways TikTok brings us together, which is why it must be banned immediately and completely.</p> <p>We need Americans to stay divided. We can’t have them find their community, organize around common causes, or realize that they might not be so alone in something they’ve been struggling with. People can get on an app and find like-minded folks in under ten seconds. How are we supposed to control them if they know they aren’t alone?</p> <p>No, we have to come together as a government and remove the one thing that brings this nation joy. That’s the only way they won’t realize that things could be better.</p> <p>See you on Red Note. This isn’t goodbye, it’s ni hao.</p>

## Evolving GitHub Issues (public preview)

date: 2025-01-16, updated: 2025-01-16, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2025-01-13-evolving-github-issues-public-preview/">Evolving GitHub Issues (public preview)</a></strong></p>
GitHub just shipped the largest set of changes to GitHub Issues I can remember in a few years. As an Issues power-user this is directly relevant to me.</p>
<p>The big new features are sub-issues, issue types and boolean operators in search.</p>
<p>Sub-issues look to be a more robust formalization of the existing feature where you could create a <code>- [ ] #123</code> Markdown list of issues in the issue description to relate issue together and track a 3/5 progress bar. There are now explicit buttons for creating a sub-issue and managing the parent relationship of such, and clicking a sub-issue opens it in a side panel on top of the parent.</p>
<p>Issue types took me a moment to track down: it turns out they are an organization level feature, so they won't show up on repos that belong to a specific user.</p>
<p>Organizations can define issue types that will be available across all of their repos. I created a "Research" one to classify research tasks, joining the default task, bug and feature types.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of Datasette organization settings page showing issue types configuration. Left sidebar shows navigation options including General, Policies, Access, etc. Main content shows 4 issue types: Task (&quot;A specific piece of work&quot;), Bug (&quot;An unexpected problem or behavior&quot;), Feature (&quot;A request, idea, or new functionality&quot;), and Research (&quot;Research is needed&quot;). A &quot;Create new type&quot; button appears in top right." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/issue-types.jpg" /></p>
<p>Unlike labels an issue can have just one issue type. You can then search for all issues of a specific type across an entire organization using <code>org:datasette type:"Research"</code> in GitHub search.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/filtering-and-searching-issues-and-pull-requests#using-parentheses-for-more-complicated-filters">new boolean logic</a> in GitHub search looks like it could be really useful - it includes AND, OR and parenthesis for grouping.</p>
<pre><code>(type:"Bug" AND assignee:octocat) OR (type:"Enhancement" AND assignee:hubot)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not sure if these are available via the GitHub APIs yet.

## 100x Defect Tolerance: How Cerebras Solved the Yield Problem

date: 2025-01-16, updated: 2025-01-16, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://cerebras.ai/blog/100x-defect-tolerance-how-cerebras-solved-the-yield-problem">100x Defect Tolerance: How Cerebras Solved the Yield Problem</a></strong></p>
I learned a bunch about how chip manufacture works from this piece where Cerebras reveal some notes about how they manufacture chips that are 56x physically larger than NVIDIA's H100.</p>
<p>The key idea here is core redundancy: designing a chip such that if there are defects the end-product is still useful. This has been a technique for decades:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example in 2006 Intel released the Intel Core Duo – a chip with two CPU cores. If one core was faulty, it was disabled and the product was sold as an Intel Core Solo. Nvidia, AMD, and others all embraced this core-level redundancy in the coming years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern GPUs are deliberately designed with redundant cores: the H100 needs 132 but the wafer contains 144, so up to 12 can be defective without the chip failing.</p>
<p>Cerebras designed their monster (look at <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49395577">the size of this thing</a>) with absolutely tiny cores: "approximately 0.05mm2" - with the whole chip needing 900,000 enabled cores out of the 970,000 total. This allows 93% of the silicon area to stay active in the finished chip, a notably high proportion.
