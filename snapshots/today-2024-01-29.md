## Berlin School

date: 2024-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Berlin School</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m listening to <a href="https://yt.cdaut.de/watch?v=BE8rMsM3zLs">Berlin Schoool: An Uncomplicated Approach</a> by Synth Seeker because <a class="account" href="https://social.sdf.org/@phf" title="@phf@social.sdf.org">@phf</a> recommended it.</p>

<p>We were talking about music. All I do is create small jingles for my podcast but every now and then I wonder about music theory.
A while ago I had saved <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0">Learn music theory in half an hour</a> by Andrew Huang to get back to it.
But all I had done about it was think to myself: Pick a scale, like this one, B Major looks nice, OK, so full full half full full full half, that’s these keys, OK, let me doodle around on these … beep beep boop boop … here we go. Or maybe do the other one, full full full half full full half … biep biep boup boup … all right! 🥳</p>

<p>But then I wonder: what would my next step be? Some days I look at the circle of fifth and wonder if that’s hogwash. Non-European music doesn&rsquo;t need it! But then again, they also use <em>something</em>. There are rules because people figured out what generally &ldquo;works&rdquo;. Well, on the other hand there are books about many things and they are neither a replacement for spending ten thousand hours practising and the rules they espouse are often just there to get you started and then they are immediately broken.</p>

<p>All I know when I look at a typical drum machine or tracker setup with <sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> or similar I immediately want to do a <a href="https://babayagamusic.com/Music/nine-eight-rhythms.htm"><sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> Karsilama</a> or something like that. My wife&rsquo;s oriental dancing and all the Turkish, Arab, Iranian and Maghreb music we listened to must have left an impression… Or confused the hell out of me, depending on your perspective. Or mine.</p>

<p>Anyway, writing all of this and I&rsquo;m still not making music. What next, I wonder. Perhaps playing C Major and playing a bunch of notes it shares with another scale and then continuing with that scale is cool. Or maybe not. I don&rsquo;t know. Or just stay in that scale and do some drum machine and patterns below that!</p>

<p>That Synth Seeker video had a link to a <a href="https://www.hooktheory.com/cheat-sheet">Key Cheat Sheet Index</a>. The effect is similar to picking scales in Garage Band or Animoog: limiting the keys I use in order to stay in that scale. Works for me!</p>

<p>All this listening and writing makes me realize that it&rsquo;s Sunday, late at night, I should go to bed, and then I&rsquo;ll be working and playing role-playing games and war-games every evening until the next week-end comes around. Whaaat!</p>

<p>I must find time between the things I do to do the other things.</p>

<p>This is my life.</p>

## Dave and Dave in 1990-something

date: 2024-01-29, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/01/29/daveAndDaveOnPotreroHill.png"></center>The Daves (Jacobs and Winer) at a Potrero Hill restaurant in the 90s.</div></p>
<p>We had already been friends for a few years then. By total coincidence we were both offered writing gigs at the then-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)#History">Wired</a>, Dave as the Fetish columnist, where he wrote about all the latest tech gadgetry, which was a perfect assignment for him, because Dave is one of the most tech-literate people you'll ever meet. Also an avid bike rider, Deadhead, and later a receiver of donated kidneys, and a pioneer of the technology for matching kidney donors with recipients. He has saved a lot of lives with his software. And he's still with us, against all odds. </p>
<p>Just chatted with him last night during the Niners game. The only football team I've ever loved, from back in the Joe Montana days. </p>
<p>I was offered a column to basically write whatever I wanted to write about, although by default I was supposed to write about the world wide web, which was then as new as ChatGPT is today and every bit as exciting. You can find our respective columns somewhere I hope on the web. </p>

## VASL Templates

date: 2024-01-29, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>VASL Templates</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to get <a href="https://vasl-templates.org/">VASL Templates</a> to run on my laptop so that I can create nice setups for Advanced Squad Leader. As it turns out, I have to use <code>pipx</code> because that automatically creates virtual environments for me, as far as I understand.</p>

<pre><code>cd src
git clone https://code.pacman-ghost.com/public/vasl-templates.git
cd vasl-templates
pipx install .
</code></pre>

<p>As it turns out, this is not enough:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
</code></pre>

<p>So now you need to install PyQt5 into the virtual environment used by vasl-templates:</p>

<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQt5
</code></pre>

<p>Next error:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/bin/vasl-templates&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
    from vasl_templates.main import main
  File &quot;/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/vasl-templates/lib/python3.11/site-packages/vasl_templates/main.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    import PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5.QtWebEngineWidgets'
</code></pre>

<p>Fix:</p>

<pre><code>pipx inject vasl-templates PyQtWebEngine
</code></pre>

<p>And now it works at last! 😅</p>

## Config Management

date: 2024-01-29, from: Miek Giebin blog

After many years of playing with YAML in k8s, I&rsquo;ve returned to using CFEngine. The last config management software before that was Puppet. An issue I see with all modern config management tooling is the lack of monitoring and the impossibility to cleanly roll back. In k8s it works better, but that&rsquo;s only for pods running in k8s, not the underlying machines.
I want something that:
works on a plain Debian machine has sane monitoring support rollbacks (is written in Go) What If?

## EV Earnings on Deck

date: 2024-01-29, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Warm temperatures in the Pacific Northwest and Central Plains could set daily records • Jet stream to dump “extended” rain on California • It’ll hit nearly 60 degrees today in Kansas City, whose Chiefs are headed to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in five years to face the San Francisco 49ers.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3><strong></strong>1. Earnings calls continue — and with them, EV insights</h3><p>
	Earnings season continues this week with 106 S&P 500 companies on deck 
	<a href="https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_012624A.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to report to investors</a> in the next five days. Upcoming calls with automakers in particular could offer additional insight into the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">purported</a> “slowing” of the electric vehicle market. Here is where things currently stand:
</p><ul>
<li>General Motors <strong>reports Tuesday</strong>. In December, the company halted sales of its 2024 Chevrolet Blazer EV over issues with software and charging, and it postponed a $4 billion electric truck plant in Michigan last year as well. GM says it sold <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/01/03/gm-q4-sales-ultium-grows-bolt-ends-best-year-ever-as-gm-has-3-1-ev-share/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">19,469</a> EVs in Q4, down slightly from the quarter before.</li>
<li>Ford reports <strong>next week</strong>. The company has significantly reduced production of its <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/pickup-trucks-sedans-ford-f150-lightning-tesla-model-3" target="_self">F-150 Lightning</a>.</li>
<li>Polestar’s Q4 results won’t be released until the <strong>end of February</strong>, but the Volvo-owned brand “cut about 15% of its global workforce [last week] in response to what it described as ‘challenging market conditions’ and lower volume expectations in 2025,” <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ev-2024-bad-start-96146554" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Last week</strong>, Tesla projected “notably slower” growth for the year ahead. The company “is clearly trying to figure out what to do next,” <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/tesla-earnings-call-model-y-3-cybertruck" target="_self">wrote</a> <em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin.</li>
</ul><h3>2. EU climate chief warns against ‘false narrative’ that climate action and business interests are at odds</h3><p>
	The European Union’s climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, said that the energy transition will mean a “heavy change” for industries on the continent but warned against the “false narrative” that climate action comes at the cost of business and innovation, 
	<em>The Financial Times</em> <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5c5b266-788a-4f2f-a5b2-5e27e54e3855" target="_blank">reported</a> Monday. Hoekstra’s comments came ahead of an intended proposal by Brussels that the EU cut emissions by 90% of 1990 levels by 2040.
</p><p>
	While the aggressive proposition would need to be agreed upon by EU governments before becoming law, environmental regulations have already rankled farmers in Germany, Poland, Romania, Belgium, and France — where 
	<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-farmers-protests-fuel-tax-cut-red-tape" target="_blank">farmers</a> even threatened to put Paris “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/french-farmers-aim-put-paris-siege-tractor-protest-106746513" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">under siege</a>” on Monday — while right-wing politicians have attacked green policies and industrialists have blamed “red tape” for holding up innovation. “We need to stand on two legs: one leg is climate action, the other leg is the just transition, competitiveness, and a thriving business community, because both are needed,” Hoekstra said.
</p><h3>3. Food sustainability activists chuck soup at the Mona Lisa </h3><p>
<strong></strong>On Sunday, a pair of activists <a href="https://x.com/riposte_alim/status/1751554606964900049?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threw soup</a> at the Mona Lisa in the Louvre museum in Paris — although Leonardo da Vinci’s painting, which has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-10-31/climate-change-food-protest-art-museums" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seen this kind of thing before</a> and resides safely behind fortified glass, was not damaged.

Chicago faces uphill battle to ban gas from new construction</h3><p>
	Last week, Chicago Mayor Mayor Brandon introduced an ordinance that would ban natural gas for cooking and heating in most new construction. “This is a critical first step for [Chicago] to take towards a planned transition away from fossil fuels,” Leslie Perkins, the chief of staff and policy director for the city’s Committee on Environmental Protection and Energy, 
	<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/chicago-mayor-natural-gas-ban-new-buildings-electrification-decarbonization-emissions/705736/#:~:text=Chicago%20Mayor%20Brandon%20Johnson%20introduced,Johnson%20in%20supporting%20the%20legislation." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Utility Drive</em> at the time. However, the ordinance faces an uphill battle, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> argued in <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-editorial-natural-gas-brandon-johnson-stoves-utilities-20240128-bkb4u53l3vcbbg6ae5z2fusoqm-story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a Sunday editorial</a>. “Better to wait and see what the statewide policy is on the future of natural gas,” the authors wrote, stressing examples like Berkeley, California, which has been unable to enforce its version of a gas ban after a federal appeals court ruled the city doesn’t have the authority. Additionally, “much of the power keeping lights on in Chicagoland comes from nuclear energy (which doesn’t emit carbon) and, ironically enough, gas (which does),” the op-ed authors pointed out. “It’s not economically feasible to build new nuclear plants at present, so any increased electricity demand will be met mostly by burning gas.”

	Over the weekend, Maui police identified the 100th victim of the August 8 Lahaina wildfire as Lydia Coloma, 70. She was also the last unidentified victim and was ID’ed using “the context of the location where the remains were found,” rather than by DNA or other methods,

## How worried should we be about rising credit card debt?

date: 2024-01-29, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Consumer spending ticked up in December, and more people are swiping their credit cards. Part of the reason folks are more comfortable putting it on plastic is confidence in the overall job market. But delinquency rates have been climbing too. We&#8217;ll hear what economists make of these trends. Also: United Airlines in talks with Airbus and ripple effects of liquidation orders for property giant Evergrande.</p>

## Warm Winters Won’t Make You Happier

date: 2024-01-29, from: Heatmap News

Or is it just the end of January? </p>
<p>It can be difficult to tell. We’re officially in the thick of what Americans consider to be the <a href="https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/45312-americans-favorite-and-least-favorite-months-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worst time of year</a>, when complaining about the weather is an acceptable salutation and feeling “blah” is the basic condition of being alive. Even setting aside seasonal affective disorder — a condition linked to <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/seasonal-affective-disorder#:~:text=Seasonal%20affective%20disorder%2C%20or%20SAD,antidepressants%20can%20help%20treat%20SAD." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">limited daylight</a>, and thus not <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/michigan-winters-are-super-cloudy-and-getting-worse-heres-how-deal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">directly affected</a> by climate change — <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231178695" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">studies have shown</a> that people have a lower quality diet in the winter, and body weight usually reaches its peak this time of year. Physical activity, which is also important for mental health, dips as the weather gets worse, and research has even shown that people with Alzheimer’s disease experience more severe symptoms when the planet is tilted away from the sun.</p>
<p>Some have taken these winter blues as an opportunity to question the basic premise that climate change is bad. “The chief benefits of global warming” include “fewer winter deaths” and lower heating bills, Matt Ridley <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-climate-change-is-good-for-the-world/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a> in <em>The Spectator </em>in 2013. Former President Donald Trump even <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/01/its-cold-so-trump-is-doubting-climate-change/580885/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has a quasi-annual tradition</a> of tweeting something like <em>“Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!” </em>during cold snaps this time of year.</p>
<p>Winter is, in fact, warming <a href="https://heatmap.news/what-is-winter-anymore" target="_self">faster than any other season</a> in the United States, with some parts of the country on track to lose over a month of freezing days as soon as 2050. Even if you do believe — correctly — that climate change is a global catastrophe, unless you’re <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/ski-snowboard-season-snow-climate-change" target="_self">a skier or snowboarder</a>, this might sound like a good thing. So, as sacrilegious as it feels to ask, <em>could</em> a warmer planet make us healthier in the wintertime? </p>
<p>When I asked Leslie Davenport, a climate psychology educator at the California Institute of Integral Studies, if she expected milder winters to impact people psychologically, she answered immediately. “Oh, one hundred percent!,” she told me. That doesn’t mean she thinks the impact will be positive. She said she has heard people “who are a little more on the climate denial end of things” make comments like “this is great, it used to be so cold and now I can go golfing,” she told me, but “I can’t honestly call that an upside.” </p><p>Far more often, Davenport said she hears from people experiencing a sense of “unsettling” as they notice winter isn’t as cold or as snowy as they remember it being. Some might even express a feeling of “solastalgia,” a neologism that describes the sense of displacement or nostalgia that arises when a place changes environmentally. “Whether it’s the loss of snow, or areas that are drier or hotter or wetter, it is like, ‘Well, this is not the town I grew up in or the place I chose to move to because it has changed so much,’” Davenport said.</p><p>While there might be an abstract appeal to the Los Angelesification of winter nationwide, it would be a mistake to count on climate change making the season “better.” Quite the opposite, actually — warmer winters could make winter much <em>worse</em>, especially for those living in midlatitude cities like New York, London, or Amsterdam. “I have observed, in my travels and my research and in talking to people, that it is often much easier and more pleasant to cope with winter weather that is slightly below freezing consistently than weather that is slightly above freezing consistently,” Kari Leibowitz, a health psychologist who is working on a book about <a href="https://www.karileibowitz.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">winter mindsets</a>, told me.</p>
<p>Cold temperatures can actually improve our lives in several ways, Leibowitz argued. For one thing, snowfall “opens up a whole bunch of winter opportunities” like sledding, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and all those winter sports that get people out of the house. That helps combat some of the bluesiness that otherwise comes from moping around indoors when it’s too gray and rainy to do anything active. Frozen lakes offer opportunities for skating and hockey, plus “there’s also a lot of beauty and intrigue in ice — you know, icicles and frozen rainstorms,” Leibowitz went on.</p><p>Snow, meanwhile, “reflects the light, so it makes the darkness of winter feel much, much brighter,” Leibowitz said. “And most people think it’s really beautiful — it’s clean and fresh and it smells good.” </p><p>Of course, winter weather can be dangerous, too, but “places that are colder and have really frozen winters have good infrastructure for dealing with that, and houses tend to be better insulated and heated more efficiently,” Leibowitz said. Bad winter weather can also give us much-needed <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/02/why-adults-still-love-snow-days/606481/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">permission to rest</a>. </p><p>While there are certain places further in the south, such as Atlanta, where winter might genuinely become more pleasant as the planet warms, “there are far more places where the end of winter is just going to mean places are dark and wet,” without the upsides that come with the snow and freezing temperatures, Leibowitz stressed. </p><p>Michael Varnum, the head of the Culture and Ecology Laboratory at Arizona State University and a specialist in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916231178695" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seasonal psychology</a>, did find one positive. “Nobody likes to feel down, or to look at their waistline and see it’s grown,” he told me. “So potentially, there could be some upsides there.”</p>
<p>Naturally, much of how you feel about winter will depend on the climate where you live. In general, though, “we are somewhat more insulated from the changes in temperature that come with the seasons than we were, say, 10,000 years ago or even a couple hundred years ago,” Varnum said. Feelings of climate anxiety and distress tend to be highest in Indigenous communities in or near the Arctic, where the cold weather is a part of cultural identity and inheritance. Likewise, Davenport told me, in “places where there tends to be a lot of snow” like Japan or Finland, “there’s talk about things like ‘winter grief,’” where a milder winter makes it so that “certain rituals or holidays that have been planned in the past can’t happen anymore or as consistently.”</p><p>Many Americans, too, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/fifth-national-climate-assessment-america" target="_self">lose a sense of themselves</a> when winter gets milder. “It’s what a lot of us love about living here: our winters,” Erich Osterberg, a Dartmouth climate scientist, <a href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2022/01/06/losing-winter-and-big-chunks-of-new-hampshires-identity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>The New Hampshire Bulletin</em></a> in 2022. “It’s more than changes to the climate,” he added, “it’s changes to our livelihood and our culture.” I encountered similar comments from Minnesotans when I was looking into how an unseasonably dry winter is imperiling this year’s cross country ski season: “Spiritually, this is terrible,” Claire Wilson, the executive director of Minneapolis’ Loppet Foundation, recently <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-climate-change-warm-winter-december-2023-laura-yuen-sven-sundgaard-world-cup-loppet/600332632/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told the <em>Star Tribune</em></a>.</p><p>Winter doesn’t have to be dreaded, Leibowitz said — much of one’s enjoyment of the season comes down to <a href="https://www.karileibowitz.com/winter-mindset" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">mindset</a>. But it does seem to matter that winter is actually, well, <em>wintery</em>, too. Whether that’s a question of our evolutionary seasonal biology (winter appears to be an important trigger for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/12/12/winter-mood-sex-concentration-diet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the human reproductive cycle</a>, for one thing), or a matter of our cultural practices, or something as simple as snow being more fun than rain, it’s hard to make the case that warming winters will leave us better off.</p><p>“If you want me to find the psychological upside of anything, I could maybe do it,” Leibowitz confessed. She added, though, that “a lot of people think, ‘I hate winter, I hate the cold, I would be happy if it was warmer all year round.’ But people underestimate how much there is to be lost in losing winter.”</p>

## House GOP releases impeachment articles in bid to oust Homeland Security’s Mayorkas over the border

				<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; House Republicans on Sunday released two articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as they vowed to swiftly push forward with election-year efforts to oust him over what they call his failure to manage the U.S.-Mexico border. The rare step against a Cabinet member drew outrage from Democrats and the agency as a politically motivated stunt lacking the constitutional basis to remove Mayorkas from office.</p>

## Pluralistic: I assure you, an AI didn't write a terrible "George Carlin" routine (29 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-29, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links I assure you, an AI didn't write a terrible "George Carlin" routine: The Mechanical Turk would like to have a word with all of us. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading I assure you, an AI didn't write a terrible "George Carlin" routine (permalink) On Hallowe'en 1974, Ronald Clark O'Bryan murdered his son with poisoned candy. He needed the insurance money, and he knew that Halloween poisonings were rampant, so he figured he'd get away with it. He was wrong: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Clark_O%27Bryan The stories of Hallowe'en poisonings were just that &#8211; stories. No one was poisoning kids on Hallowe'en &#8211; except this monstrous murderer, who mistook rampant scare stories for truth and assumed (incorrectly) that his murder would blend in with the crowd. Last week, the dudes behind the "comedy" podcast Dudesy released a "George Carlin" comedy special that they claimed had been created, holus bolus, by an AI trained on the comedian's routines. This was a lie. After the Carlin estate sued, the dudes admitted that they had written the (remarkably unfunny) "comedy" special: https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/george-carlins-heirs-sue-comedy-podcast-over-ai-generated-impression/ As I've written, we're nowhere near the point where an AI can do your job, but we're well past the point where your boss can be suckered into firing you and replacing you with a bot that fails at doing your job: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/15/passive-income-brainworms/#four-hour-work-week AI systems can do some remarkable party tricks, but there's a huge difference between producing a plausible sentence and a good one. After the initial rush of astonishment, the stench of botshit becomes unmistakable: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/03/botshit-generative-ai-imminent-threat-democracy Some of this botshit comes from people who are sold a bill of goods: they're convinced that they can make a George Carlin special without any human intervention and when the bot fails, they manufacture their own botshit, assuming they must be bad at prompting the AI. This is an old technology story: I had a friend who was contracted to livestream a Canadian awards show in the earliest days of the web. They booked in multiple ISDN lines from Bell Canada and set up an impressive Mbone encoding station on the wings of the stage. Only one problem: the ISDNs flaked (this was a common problem with ISDNs!). There was no way to livecast the show. Nevertheless, my friend's boss's ordered him to go on pretending to livestream the show. They made a big deal of it, with all kinds of cool visualizers showing the progress of this futuristic marvel, which the cameras frequently lingered on, accompanied by overheated narration from the show's hosts. The weirdest part? The next day, my friend &#8211; and many others &#8211; heard from satisfied viewers who boasted about how amazing it had been to watch this show on their computers, rather than their TVs. Remember: there had been no stream. These people had just assumed that the problem was on their end &#8211; that they had failed to correctly install and configure the multiple browser plugins required. Not wanting to admit their technical incompetence, they instead boasted about how great the show had been. It was the Emperor's New Livestream. Perhaps that's what happened to the Dudesy bros. But there's another possibility: maybe they were captured by their own imaginations. In "Genesis," an essay in the 2007 collection The Creationists, EL Doctorow (no relation) describes how the ancient Babylonians were so poleaxed by the strange wonder of the story they made up about the origin of the universe that they assumed that it must be true. They themselves weren't nearly imaginative enough to have come up with this super-cool tale, so God must have put it in their minds: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/29/gedankenexperimentwahn/#high-on-your-own-supply That seems to have been what happened to the Air Force colonel who falsely claimed that a "rogue AI-powered drone" had spontaneously evolved the strategy of killing its operator as a way of clearing the obstacle to its main objective, which was killing the enemy: https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/04/ayyyyyy-eyeeeee/ This never happened. It was &#8211; in the chagrined colonel's words &#8211; a "thought experiment." In other words, this guy &#8211; who is the USAF's Chief of AI Test and Operations &#8211; was so excited about his own made up story that he forgot it wasn't true and told a whole conference-room full of people that it had actually happened. Maybe that's what happened with the George Carlinbot 3000: the Dudesy dudes fell in love with their own vision for a fully automated luxury Carlinbot and forgot that they had made it up, so they just cheated, assuming they would eventually be able to make a fully operational Battle Carlinbot. That's basically the Theranos story: a teenaged "entrepreneur" was convinced that she was just about to produce a seemingly impossible, revolutionary diagnostic machine, so she faked its results, abetted by investors, customers and others who wanted to believe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos The thing about stories of AI miracles is that they are peddled by both AI's boosters and its critics. For boosters, the value of these tall tales is obvious: if normies can be convinced that AI is capable of performing miracles, they'll invest in it. They'll even integrate it into their product offerings and then quietly hire legions of humans to pick up the botshit it leaves behind. These abettors can be relied upon to keep the defects in these products a secret, because they'll assume that they've committed an operator error. After all, everyone knows that AI can do anything, so if it's not performing for them, the problem must exist between the keyboard and the chair. But this would only take AI so far. It's one thing to hear implausible stories of AI's triumph from the people invested in it &#8211; but what about when AI's critics repeat those stories? If your boss thinks an AI can do your job, and AI critics are all running around with their hair on fire, shouting about the coming AI jobpocalypse, then maybe the AI really can do your job? https://locusmag.com/2020/07/cory-doctorow-full-employment/ There's a name for this kind of criticism: "criti-hype," coined by Lee Vinsel, who points to many reasons for its persistence, including the fact that it constitutes an "academic business-model": https://sts-news.medium.com/youre-doing-it-wrong-notes-on-criticism-and-technology-hype-18b08b4307e5 That's four reasons: for AI hype: I. to win investors and customers; II. to cover customers' and users' embarrassment when the AI doesn't perform; III. AI dreamers so high on their own supply that they can't tell truth from fantasy; IV. A business-model for doomsayers who form an unholy alliance with AI companies by parroting their silliest hype in warning form. But there's a fifth motivation for criti-hype: to simplify otherwise tedious and complex situations. As Jamie Zawinski writes, this is the motivation behind the obvious lie that the "autonomous cars" on the streets of San Francisco have no driver: https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/01/driverless-cars-always-have-a-driver/ GM's Cruise division was forced to shutter its SF operations after one of its "self-driving" cars dragged an injured pedestrian for 20 feet: https://www.wired.com/story/cruise-robotaxi-self-driving-permit-revoked-california/ One of the widely discussed revelations in the wake of the incident was that Cruise employed 1.5 skilled technical remote overseers for every one of its "self-driving" cars. In other words, they had replaced a single low-waged cab driver with 1.5 higher-paid remote operators. As Zawinski writes, SFPD is well aware that there's a human being (or more than one human being) responsible for every one of these cars &#8211; someone who is formally at fault when the cars injure people or damage property. Nevertheless, SFPD and SFMTA maintain that these cars can't be cited for moving violations because "no one is driving them." But figuring out who which person is responsible for a moving violation is "complicated and annoying to deal with," so the fiction persists. (Zawinski notes that even when these people are held responsible, they're a "moral crumple zone" for the company that decided to enroll whole cities in nonconsensual murderbot experiments.) Automation hype has always involved hidden humans. The most famous of these was the "mechanical Turk" hoax: a supposed chess-playing robot that was just a puppet operated by a concealed human operator wedged awkwardly into its carapace. This pattern repeats itself through the ages. Thomas Jefferson "replaced his slaves" with dumbwaiters &#8211; but of course, dumbwaiters don't replace slaves, they hide slaves: https://www.stuartmcmillen.com/blog/behind-the-dumbwaiter/ The modern Mechanical Turk &#8211; a division of Amazon that employs low-waged "clickworkers," many of them overseas &#8211; modernizes the dumbwaiter by hiding low-waged workforces behind a veneer of automation. The MTurk is an abstract "cloud" of human intelligence (the tasks MTurks perform are called "HITs," which stands for "Human Intelligence Tasks"). This is such a truism that techies in India joke that "AI" stands for "absent Indians." Or, to use Jathan Sadowski's wonderful term: "Potemkin AI": https://reallifemag.com/potemkin-ai/ This Potemkin AI is everywhere you look. When Tesla unveiled its humanoid robot Optimus, they made a big flashy show of it, promising a $20,000 automaton was just on the horizon. They failed to mention that Optimus was just a person in a robot suit: https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/elon-musk-tesla-robot-optimus-ai Likewise with the famous demo of a "full self-driving" Tesla, which turned out to be a canned fake: https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-video-promoting-self-driving-was-staged-engineer-testifies-2023-01-17/ The most shocking and terrifying and enraging AI demos keep turning out to be "Just A Guy" (in Molly White's excellent parlance): https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1751670561606971895 And yet, we keep falling for it. It's no wonder, really: criti-hype rewards so many different people in so many different ways that it truly offers something for everyone.

## What makes them do it?

The problem of large numbers of asylum seekers trying to cross the Channel in small boats is one, I confess, that I have avoided thinking about too much &#8212; and I therefore understand few of the subtleties involved. So I was particularly taken by this BBC piece, which follows one 14-year-old boy, Obada, who died <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/01/29/11922/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## January 28, 2024

date: 2024-01-29, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Today&#8212;last night U.S. time&#8212;three military personnel were killed and 34 more wounded in a drone attack on the living quarters at a U.S. base in Jordan, near the Iraq-Syria border. U.S. troops are stationed there to enable them to cross into Syria to help fight the Islamic State. There have been almost-daily drone and missile strikes on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria since the October 7 attack on Israel by Iran-backed Hamas. The U.S. has blamed Iran-backed militant groups for the attack, and while no one has officially claimed responsibility yet, three officials from such groups have said an Iran-backed militia in Iraq is responsible.

## Illinois Election Officials to Consider Striking Trump's Name off Primary Ballot

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

CHICAGO — Former President Donald Trump should be removed from Illinois' primary ballot, but the decision should be left to the courts, a retired judge recommended Sunday to the state's election board, arguing that it was clear Trump engaged in insurrection in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.


The Illinois State Board of Elections is expected to consider the recommendation Tuesday. Attorneys for Trump and citizens seeking to keep the Republican former president off the ballot presented their arguments Friday before the hearing officer, Clark Erickson. The retired longtime Kankakee County judge is a Republican.


The Illinois effort to keep Trump off the March ballot is similar to those filed in several other states. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments next month in a historic Colorado Supreme Court ruling to remove Trump from that state’s ballot. The case presents the high court with its first look at a provision of the 14th Amendment barring some people who “engaged in insurrection” from holding public office.


Erickson’s 21-page recommendation concluded that a “preponderance of the evidence” presented proves that Trump engaged in insurrection.


But he said the election board can't engage in the “significant and sophisticated constitutional analysis” required to remove Trump’s name before the March 19 primary.


“All in all, attempting to resolve a constitutional issue within the expedited schedule of an election board hearing is somewhat akin to scheduling a two-minute round between heavyweight boxers in a telephone booth,” he wrote.

Still, Erickson noted that even if the board disagrees with his reasoning, Trump's name should be removed from the Illinois primary ballot.


The election board is split evenly between four Democrats and four Republicans.


Free Speech for People, which is leading the Illinois ballot effort, praised the recommendation from the Republican retired judge as “significant” but argued that Illinois law allows the board to make the ballot decision.


“We expect that the board and ultimately Illinois courts will uphold Judge Erickson’s thoughtful analysis of why Trump is disqualified from office, but — with the greatest respect — correct him on why Illinois law authorizes that ruling,” Ron Fein, legal director for the group, wrote in a Sunday statement.


Trump's campaign did not immediately return a message left Sunday.

## House Republicans Release Impeachment Articles Against Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — House Republicans on Sunday released two articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas as they vowed to swiftly push forward with election-year efforts to oust him over what they call his failure to manage the U.S.-Mexico border. The rare step against a Cabinet member drew outrage from Democrats and the agency as a politically motivated stunt lacking the constitutional basis to remove Mayorkas from office.


Republicans contend Mayorkas is guilty of “high crimes and misdemeanors” that amount to a “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law” on immigration and a “breach of the public trust.” Impeachment, they say, is “Congress's only viable option."


“Alejandro N. Mayorkas willfully and systemically refused to comply with the immigration laws, failed to control the border to the detriment of national security, compromised public safety, and violated the rule of law and separation of powers in the Constitution, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States," the impeachment resolution says.


Only once in American history has a Cabinet secretary been impeached: William Belknap, President Ulysses Grant's war secretary, in 1876, over kickbacks in government contracts. Going after an official for a policy dispute, in this instance over the claim that Mayorkas is not upholding immigration laws, is unprecedented.

Ever since taking control of the House in 2023, Republicans have pushed to impeach Mayorkas. Sunday’s announcement comes as their other impeachment drive — to impeach Democratic President Joe Biden in relation to his son Hunter's business dealings — has struggled to advance.


But Republicans have moved with rapid speed against Mayorkas after a series of hearings in recent weeks. It all comes at a time when border security and immigration are key issues in the 2024 campaign and as Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is promising to launch the “largest deportation operation” in U.S. history if he returns to the White House.


The Republican-controlled House Homeland Security Committee is set to vote Tuesday on the articles of impeachment, aiming to send them to the full House for consideration. Republican Speaker Mike Johnson has said the House will move forward as soon as possible with a vote after that.


Passage requires only a House majority. The Senate would hold a trial, and a two-thirds vote is required for conviction, an exceedingly unlikely outcome in the Democratic-run Senate.


The Republican push also comes at a curious time for Mayorkas.


Even as the House is taking steps to try to remove him from office, Mayorkas has been engaged in arduous negotiations with senators seeking to reach a bipartisan deal on border policy. He has won praise from senators for his engagement in the process.


Democrats have lambasted the impeachment proceedings, calling them a waste of time when lawmakers should be working together to solve the problems. They also say Republicans are part of the problems at the border, with Republicans attacking Mayorkas even as they have failed to give his department the tools it needs to manage the situation.


“They don’t want to fix the problem; they want to campaign on it. That’s why they have undermined efforts to achieve bipartisan solutions and ignored the facts, legal scholars and experts, and even the Constitution itself in their quest to baselessly impeach Secretary Mayorkas,” the department said in a statement Sunday.


Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House committee, said the Republican resolution did not have “a shred of evidence of high crimes or misdemeanors — the Constitutional standard for impeachment.” 


The two articles mark the culmination of a roughly yearlong examination by Republicans of the secretary's handling of the border and what they describe as a crisis of the administration's own making. Republicans contend that the administration and Mayorkas specifically either got rid of policies in place under Trump that had controlled migration or enacted policies of their own that encouraged migrants from around the world to come to the U.S. illegally via the southern border. They also accused Mayorkas of lying to Congress, pointing to comments about the border being secure or about vetting of Afghans airlifted to the U.S.


They cite growing numbers of migrants who have at times overwhelmed the capacity of Customs and Border Protection authorities to care for and process them. Arrests for illegal crossings topped 2 million in each of the U.S. government’s past two budget years. In December, arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico reached an all-time high since figures have been released. The backlog of people in immigration court has grown by 1 million over the past budget year.


In the articles, Republicans argue that Mayorkas is deliberately violating immigration laws passed by Congress, such as those requiring detention of migrants, and that through his policies, a crisis has arisen at the border. They accuse him of releasing migrants without effective ways to make sure they show up for court or are removed from the country. They cited an Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo written by Mayorkas that sets priorities for whom the agency should target for enforcement proceedings as proof that he is letting people stay in the country who don't have the right to do so.


They also attacked the administration’s use of the humanitarian parole authority, which allows the DHS secretary to admit certain migrants into the country. Republicans said the Biden administration has essentially created a mass parole program that bypasses Congress. They cited cities such as New York that have struggled with high numbers of migrants, taxing housing and education systems, as proof of the financial costs immigration is taking.


Democrats, as well as Mayorkas, have argued that it’s not the administration’s policies that are causing people to attempt to migrate to America but that the movement is part of a global mass migration of people fleeing wars, economic instability and political repression.

## Revelers Pack Tampa, Florida, Waterfront for Gasparilla Pirate Fest

date: 2024-01-29, from: VOA News USA

Tampa, Florida — Revelers clad in pirate finery packed Tampa's waterfront this weekend as a flotilla of boats arrived for the city's annual Gasparilla Pirate Fest.


Led by Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla, the invading pirates docked to make a final demand for the key to the city. Once ashore, the festivities celebrating their annual invasion included a Saturday afternoon parade through downtown and live music and bead throwing that lasted well into the night.


A fixture nearly every year since 1904, the Gasparilla Pirate Fest is named for the mythical pirate Jose Gaspar. There's not much evidence he actually existed, but according to legend he plundered ships and captured hostages in the Gulf of Mexico from the 1780s until around 1821.


The colorful account of his supposed life first surfaced in the early 1900s in an advertising brochure for the Gasparilla Inn, which was located south of Tampa in Boca Grande at the end of a rail line and in need of an exciting promotion to lure in guests.


Called the “Last of the Buccaneers,” Gaspar's memory lives on in the name of Tampa Bay’s NFL team.

## US, China to Resume Stalled Fentanyl Talks in Beijing

date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. and Chinese officials will meet in Beijing Tuesday for their first talks in years to stem the production of ingredients for the drug fentanyl, senior Biden administration officials said.


The meeting of the counternarcotics working group comes after Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged during a summit with U.S. President Joe Biden in November to clamp down on the trade.


"For years bilateral cooperation between the United States and the People's Republic of China on counternarcotics has been suspended which has hindered our progress," a U.S. official said.


"But that changed during the November 15 meeting," the official told reporters on the condition of anonymity.


Washington hopes to get China to cooperate on tackling companies that manufacture the precursor chemicals to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid many times more powerful than heroin, and on cutting financing for the trade.


Fentanyl has caused an epidemic of addiction in the United States, with 100,000 overdose deaths a year, making it the leading cause of death of people aged 18 to 49, the official said.


Since the summit China has shut down one company, blocked some international payments and resumed sharing information on shipments and trafficking, added the official.


The meeting, featuring U.S. justice, homeland security, diplomatic and counternarcotics officials, will focus on "ongoing coordination to support concrete enforcement actions."


Xi said after meeting Biden in California in November that China "deeply sympathizes" with victims of fentanyl.


China and the United States have been trying to stabilize relations after years of tensions with Beijing's top diplomat Wang Yi and U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan meeting in Bangkok this past week.


Another senior U.S. official said after those talks that cooperation on fentanyl between the two countries "needs to be continuous and ongoing. It's not just one snapshot in time."

## New Orleans Thief Steals 7 King Cakes From Bakery in Very Mardi Gras Way

date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA

New Orleans, Louisiana — With their purple, gold and green colors and toy babies hidden inside, king cakes are staples of Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans, but apparently they're also valuable enough to steal — at least this time of year during the Carnival season.


A thief stole seven king cakes — about as many as he could carry — during a break-in last week at a New Orleans bakery. The thief also took cash and a case of vodka from Bittersweet Confections last Wednesday, according to the New Orleans Police Department.


"Our king cakes are just that good," the bakery wrote on social media. "But please come and purchase one during our regular store hours."


While it's a secular celebration, Carnival in New Orleans — and around the world — is strongly linked to Christian and Roman Catholic traditions. The season begins on Jan. 6, the 12th day after Christmas, and continues until Mardi Gras, known as Fat Tuesday, which is the final day of feasting, drinking and revelry before Ash Wednesday and the fasting associated with Lent.


King cakes are among the foods most associated with Carnival in New Orleans. The rings of pastry are adorned with purple, green and gold sugar or icing, and they often have a tiny plastic baby hidden inside as a prize.


One wisecracker responded to the bakery's social media post with a tongue-in-cheek false admission that he was the thief.


"It was me. ...I'm holding all seven babies hostage until I get a lifetime supply of King Cakes from you every year," the man posted.

## Oregon Newspaper to Relaunch Print Edition After Theft Forced It to Lay Off Its Staff

date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA

Portland, Oregon — An Oregon weekly newspaper that had to lay off its entire staff after its funds were embezzled by a former employee will relaunch its print edition next month, its editor said, a move made possible in large part by fundraising campaigns and community contributions.


The Eugene Weekly will return to newsstands on Feb. 8 with roughly 25,000 copies, about six weeks after the embezzlement forced the decades-old publication to halt its print edition, editor Camilla Mortensen said Saturday.


"It has been both terrifying and wonderful," Mortensen told The Associated Press, describing the emotional rollercoaster of the last few weeks. "I thought it was hard to run a paper. It's much harder to resurrect a paper."


The alternative weekly, founded in 1982 and distributed for free in Eugene, one of the largest cities in Oregon, had to lay off its entire 10-person staff right before Christmas. It was around that time that the paper became aware of at least $100,000 in unpaid bills and discovered that a now-former employee who had been involved with the paper's finances had used its bank account to pay themselves around $90,000, Mortensen said.


Additionally, multiple employees, including Mortensen, realized that money from their paychecks that was supposed to be going into retirement accounts was never deposited.


The accused employee was fired after the embezzlement came to light.


The news was a devastating blow to a publication that serves as an important source of information in a community that, like many others nationwide, is struggling with growing gaps in local news coverage.


The Eugene police department's investigation is still ongoing, and forensic accountants hired by the paper are continuing to piece together what happened.


Local Eugene news outlets KEZI and KLCC were among the first to report the weekly's return to print.


Since the layoffs, some former staff members have continued to volunteer their time to help keep the paper's website up and running. Much of the online content published in recent weeks has been work from journalism students at the University of Oregon, located in Eugene, and from freelancers who offered to submit stories for free — "the journalistic equivalent of pro bono," Mortensen said.


Some former employees had to find other jobs in order to make ends meet. But Mortensen hopes to eventually rehire her staff once the paper pays its outstanding bills and becomes more financially sustainable.


The paper has raised roughly $150,000 since December, Mortensen said. The majority of the money came from an online GoFundMe campaign, but financial support also came from local businesses, artists and readers. The paper even received checks from people living as far away as Iowa and New York after news outlets across the country picked up the story.


"People were so invested in helping us that it just really gives me hope for journalism at a time where I think a lot of people don't have hope," she told the AP. "When we saw how many people contributed and how many people continue to offer to help, you can't not try to print the paper. You've got to give it a shot."


The paper aims to continue weekly printing beyond Feb. 8.

## The Real Problem With Spotify

date: 2024-01-28, from: Om Malik blog

As a way to play music, it was better in nearly every way. Spotify then became my favorite way to listen to music. Recently though, I’ve found myself hating Spotify. The app loads slowly. Music no longer plays instantly. The interface is riddled with recommendations, podcasts, audiobooks, and other junk that I don’t care for. &#8230;

## Resizing macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture

date: 2024-01-28, from: Jeff Geerling blog

<span class="field field--name-title field--type-string field--label-hidden">Resizing macOS app windows for 16:9 screen capture</span>

            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item"><p>I frequently need to capture a window of some Mac app for a recording (usually for my YouTube channel), and I've used a little AppleScript I wrote years ago for the purpose.</p>

<p>Somehow, that script (which I saved as a 'one shot' App (<code>.app</code> extension) that just runs then quits) got deleted off my Script Editor folder in my iCloud Drive, so I had to re-create it.</p>

<p>Luckily, the syntax for this operation is dead simple:</p>

<pre><code>tell application "Safari"
    set bounds of front window to {0, 50, 1280, 770}
end tell
</code></pre>

<p>You can adjust the <code>{X, Y, width, height}</code> parameters accordingly—note that the width and height seem to be additive to the X/Y. So I use 770 instead of 720 for the height (720 + 50).</p>

<p>In <code>Script Editor</code>, save the file as a <code>.app</code>, with the option to keep it running unchecked. Now, whenever you want a window sized perfectly for capture, just press Command + Spacebar, then type in the name of the Script/App you saved, and hit enter. The top-most window in Safari will scale to exactly 720p resolution.</p></div>

## Honda Pilot once ruled but no more

date: 2024-01-28, from: San Jose Mercury News

The Honda Pilot debuted 21 years ago as the Japanese carmaker's largest sport utility vehicle. It succeeded quickly as an alternative to its seven-year older and smaller sibling, the Honda CR-V. 

The Honda HR-V, the smallest of an SUV foursome, arrived in North America in 2015. The Honda Passport, positioned between the HR-V and the Pilot, debuted in 1993.

## Morning ChatGPT Notes

date: 2024-01-28, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/04/peterRojas.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I spent a couple of days putting together a JSON text editor in a modal dialog for a project I'm working on. I'm combining the <a href="https://github.com/scripting/aceEditorDemo">Ace editor</a> with the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap toolkit</a>. I've used both components before, but never together. And they're always a bit tricky to get working because I'm impatient and the docs are spread out, and there are different versions. It's all kind of a mess, so you just get it working and move on, never quite sure why it works, and I rarely end up with reusable code. But it's certainly a lot better than starting from scratch, which basically is impossible, given the depth of the two components. After spinning my wheels a bit, I did what I always do in 2024, I turned to ChatGPT, outlined the problem, and asked if it knew of any sample code, which it proceeded to write for me, in about two seconds (not kidding about that). I copied their code and pasted it into my editor and ran it. It worked. Then I went through a number of iterations, restructuring the code to meet my needs, each time checking with ChatGPT, asking what it thought of my code. And of course there were problems, for example at one point there were two vertical scrollbars, and each time we worked <i>together</i> to figure out the problem and the fix. In the end, I have a solid editor that works exactly as I want it to, and best of all, I understand how it works. Here's the <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/840e8159-9988-4159-8289-5167d6fb78c8">transcript of the work</a> I did with it, over more than 24 hours, a few different sessions. </p>
<p>I'll try to remember when this code ships as part of a product, to link to this perspective.</p>
<p>Next up, I'd like to get it to understand my coding conventions, so when it shares code with me it can save me the step of having to convert its conventions to mine. In other words, I'd like to return the favor. It's doing a great job of teaching and coaching me. I'd like to teach it how to do that better, so we work better together over time. And perhaps it can teach human programmers what I've learned about programming in over 50 years of doing this work. </p>
<p><img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2017/09/05/enjoyEveryDay.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">A bit of philosophy. People say these things aren't intelligent, but seriously, if I can engage with it as if it were intelligent, far more intelligent in ways than I am, what's the difference between that and actually being intelligent? I know from a lifetime of dealing with supposedly intelligent humans, and being one myself, how rarely we focus on the idea that the person we're conversing with has an inner life that's vastly different from ours and no less complex, and contradictory. We tend to think of others as being like us, or like someone who raised us. Always in a movie, never in the moment. So why is it interesting that ChatGPT is a machine? These are questions thinkers and writers have been pondering for decades if not centuries, but -- <i>now we're living it.</i> I'm so happy to have made it this far! An amazing experience, so much learning in so little time. I don't understand how people can sit on the sidelines and not want to be the first to try all this stuff out, to be part of its evolution. I feel so lucky. </p>
<p>A puzzling thing, in the transcripts I'm identified as "anonymous," but I am logged in. It must know my name. I bet this is some kind of setting which defaults to anonymous, to play it safe. </p>
<p>One more thing. I copied and pasted the text above into ChatGPT. <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5fe361cd-1fca-4e8d-82cc-920514e8c4b8">Here are its comments</a>. A funny thing about ChatGPT is that you can't ask it how to use ChatGPT itself. It doesn't know about the chat UI? </p>
<p>Yet another thing. I remember my father, when he was forced to retire by illness, said how fortunate he was that the internet was there, so he could be involved in the world even though he had stopped working. He said his father would have loved it, and I don't doubt that he would. Same with ChatGPT. My parents and uncles were always looking up stuff, wanting to understand how things worked. This is a whole new level. The machines are now far better at collaborating over the net than humans are. Where will that take us? Maybe this is something else we can learn from the machines. </p>

## Drivethru, I am unhappy!

date: 2024-01-28, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>Drivethru, I am unhappy!</h1>

<p>The DrivethruRPG website so depends on shit that it loads from other domains that I cannot log in no matter how many exceptions I add to uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, or the Firefox content blocking preferences. And with every second I spend doing this, I resent them more. And when I finally start Chromium to try and connect, I&rsquo;m already ranting as I sit at my laptop. And then I get Connection timed out from cloudflare and really… I feel like they don&rsquo;t want my money. Uuuugh.</p>

<p>I used their contact form. When I hit the submit button I was greeted by a white page. I don&rsquo;t know if they go an email. (I did try the next day from a phone and that worked – which sort of illustrates the point.)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I wrote:</p>

<p>I think in a world where big tech is tracking us, where everybody and their uncle is spying on us, it is only natural that people start locking down their browser. I have uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger installed and I tell all my browsers to do as much content blocking as they can, I delete all cookies when I close the browser. It&rsquo;s the right thing to do. It is all the more galling when a website such as Drivethru becomes practically unusable as a consequence of me trying to do the right thing. It feels as if Drivethru is betraying me to the big tech corporations, helping them spy on me. It&rsquo;s a revolting feeling. These days, I have it every time I remember to use an unprotected Chromium browser just to log into Drivethru. Every single time I wish for an alternative. Every single time I hope that itch.io and other competitors end up replacing you.</p>

<p>If only you had a simple, straight forward website, served your own Javascript, had no tracking, and allowed me to browse stuff and buy it.
I don&rsquo;t really expect an answer to this email. It just feels unfair to rant on social media about the situation without telling you about it.</p>

<p>I hope Drivethru improves. I really do. I believe that change is possible and I hope that you do, too.</p>

## US Sees Signs of Progress on Deal to Release Israeli Hostages, Pause War

date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. negotiators are making progress on a potential agreement under which Israel would pause military operations against Hamas in Gaza for two months in exchange for the release of more than 100 hostages who were captured in the October 7 attack on Israel, according to two senior administration officials.


The officials, who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive negotiations, said Saturday that emerging terms of the yet-to-be sealed deal would play out over two phases.


In the first phase, fighting would stop to allow for the remaining women, elderly and wounded hostages to be released by Hamas.


Israel and Hamas would then aim to work out details during the first 30 days of the pause for a second phase in which Israeli soldiers and civilian men would be released. The emerging deal also calls for Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza.


While the proposed deal would not end the war, U.S. officials are hopeful that such an agreement could lay the groundwork for a durable resolution to the conflict.


The New York Times first reported on Saturday that progress has been made towards an agreement for a pause in fighting in exchange for the remaining hostages.


CIA director Bill Burns is expected to discuss the contours of the emerging agreement when he meets on Sunday in France with David Barnea, the head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Egyptian intelligence chief Abbas Kamel for talks centered on the hostage negotiations, according to three people familiar with the scheduled meeting who were not authorized to comment publicly.


President Joe Biden on Friday spoke by phone with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Qatar's ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani. Calls with both leaders focused on the hostage situation.


"Both leaders affirmed that a hostage deal is central to establishing a prolonged humanitarian pause in the fighting and ensure additional life-saving humanitarian assistance reaches civilians in need throughout Gaza," the White House said in a statement about Biden's call with the Qatari leader. "They underscored the urgency of the situation, and welcomed the close cooperation among their teams to advance recent discussions."




Burns heads to France for the high-level talks after White House senior adviser Brett McGurk traveled to the Mideast this week for talks on the hostage situation.


If Burns sees progress in his talks in France, Biden may dispatch McGurk back to the Mideast quickly to try to complete an agreement. McGurk during his talks this week was also laying the groundwork for another trip to the region by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who next week could make his fifth trip to the Middle East since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October.


The White House and CIA have yet to publicly confirm Burns' meeting in France and administration officials have been guarded that a deal can quickly be brokered.


"We should not expect any imminent developments," National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on Friday.


Biden and his aides are keenly aware that the mounting Palestinian death toll, and widespread suffering in Gaza, is frustrating some in his Democratic base, who want to see him put more pressure on Israel to end the war. Democrats in Michigan have warned the White House that Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict could cost him enough support within the state's sizable Arab American community to sway the outcome of the 2024 election in a state that could be key to whether he wins a second term.


Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to continue the offensive until complete victory over Hamas is achieved.


Netanyahu has faced increasing pressure from the families of many hostages who are demanding a deal to win their loved ones' release.


The October 7 attack killed some 1,200 people in Israel, and Hamas and other militants abducted around 250 people.


Around 100 hostages were freed under a weeklong cease-fire deal in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Around 130 remain captive, but a number have since been confirmed dead.


Hamas has previously said it will free more captives only in exchange for an end to the war and the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners.

## Artist Who Performed Nude Sues Museum Over Sexual Assault Claims

date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA

albany, new york — A performer who appeared naked in a show by world-renowned performance artist Marina Abramovic at New York City's Museum of Modern Art is suing the museum, saying it failed to take action after he was sexually assaulted multiple times by attendees during the performances nearly 14 years ago. 


The suit was filed in Manhattan on Monday under the New York Adult Survivors Act, a special state law that created a yearslong suspension of the usual time limit for accusers to sue. Although the law expired last year, the suit says the parties agreed to extend the window closing. 


John Bonafede alleges in the suit he was sexually assaulted by five public onlookers who attended a show he was hired by the museum to perform in as part of Abramovic's retrospective "The Artist Is Present." 


Email messages sent to the museum this week were not returned. Abramovic is not named as a defendant and did not immediately return a request for comment. 


The work, titled "Imponderabilia," saw Bonafede and another performer standing face-to-face with each other in a doorway about 18 inches (45.7 centimeters) apart, fully nude, silent, and still. The exhibition, which ran from March 14, 2010, through May 31, 2010, was curated by the museum in a way that encouraged visitors to pass in between the performers as they went from one gallery to the next, the suit alleges. 


Mostly older men involved, says suit


The people who assaulted Bonafede were mostly older men, the suit says. One of the perpetrators was a corporate member of the museum, who was ultimately kicked out and revoked of his membership, according to the suit. 


During the final weeks of the exhibition, another attendee non-consensually groped Bonafede's private areas three times before they were finally stopped by security, the suit said. 


Bonafede reported four of the individuals to the museum staff and security immediately, according to the suit, while the fifth was witnessed personally by the museum security staff. 


Female performer also assaulted, suit says


At one point, Bonafede also witnessed a public attendee sexually assault his female co-performer by kissing her on the mouth without her consent, the suit said. 


Prior to the exhibition, the performers had voiced their concerns about nude performers being subject to harassment in a letter to the museum during contract negotiations, the suit said. 


Once it began, several news outlets including The New York Times reported on the inappropriate behavior by visitors, and the sexual assaults on "Imponderabilia" were discussed within New York City's art and performance communities, the suit says. 


Despite the museum having knowledge of the issue, it failed to take action to protect the performers and prevent further sexual assaults, such as telling visitors ahead of time that touching was not allowed, the lawsuit said. 


About a month into the exhibition, the museum created a handbook outlining protocols for the performers to alert museum staff if they felt unsafe or were inappropriately touched. 


Bonafede agreed to continue the performance after he was assaulted because of the "tough it out" culture of the exhibition, the suit says, but suffered for years from emotional distress, and his mental health, body image and career were damaged as a result. 


The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly. Bonafede gave consent through his lawyer, Jordan Fletcher. 


Fletcher declined to comment further on the suit, but said they will be seeking a jury trial and compensatory damages.

## Avian Flu Outbreaks Roil US Poultry Industry

date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA

PETALUMA, Calif.  — Last month, Mike Weber got the news every poultry farmer fears: His chickens tested positive for avian flu.


Following government rules, Weber's company, Sunrise Farms, had to slaughter its entire flock of egg-laying hens — 550,000 birds — to prevent the disease from infecting other farms in Sonoma County north of San Francisco.


"It's a trauma. We're all going through grief as a result of it," said Weber, standing in an empty hen house. "Petaluma is known as the Egg Basket of the World. It's devastating to see that egg basket go up in flames."


A year after the bird flu led to record egg prices and widespread shortages, the disease known as highly pathogenic avian influenza is wreaking havoc in California, which escaped the earlier wave of outbreaks that devastated poultry farms in the Midwest.


The highly contagious virus has ravaged Sonoma County, where officials have declared a state of emergency. During the past two months, nearly a dozen commercial farms have had to destroy more than 1 million birds to control the outbreak, dealing an economic blow to farmers, workers and their customers.


Merced County in Central California also has been hit hard, with outbreaks at several large commercial egg-producing farms in recent weeks.


Experts say bird flu is spread by ducks, geese and other migratory birds. The waterfowl can carry the virus without getting sick and easily spread it through their droppings to chicken and turkey farms and backyard flocks through droppings and nasal discharges.


California poultry farms are implementing strict biosecurity measures to curb the spread of the disease. State Veterinarian Annette Jones urged farmers to keep their flocks indoors until June, including organic chickens that are required to have outdoor access.


"We still have migration going for another couple of months. So we've got to be as vigilant as possible to protect our birds," said Bill Mattos, president of the California Poultry Federation.




The loss of local hens led to a spike in egg prices in the San Francisco Bay Area over the holidays before supermarkets and restaurants found suppliers from outside the region.


While bird flu has been around for decades, the current outbreak of the virus that began in early 2022 has prompted officials to slaughter nearly 82 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens, in 47 U.S. states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Whenever the disease is found the entire flock is slaughtered to help limit the spread of the virus.


The price of a dozen eggs more than doubled to $4.82 at its peak in January 2023. Egg prices returned to their normal range as egg producers built up their flocks and outbreaks were controlled. Turkey and chicken prices also spiked, partly due to the virus.


"I think this is an existential issue for the commercial poultry industry. The virus is on every continent, except for Australia at this point," said Maurice Pitesky, a poultry expert at the University of California, Davis.


Climate change is increasing the risk of outbreaks as changing weather patterns disrupt the migratory patterns of wild birds, Pitesky said. For example, exceptional rainfall last year created new waterfowl habitat throughout California, including areas close to poultry farms.


In California, the outbreak has impacted more than 7 million chickens in about 40 commercial flocks and 24 backyard flocks, with most of the outbreaks occurring over the past two months on the North Coast and Central Valley, according to the USDA.


Industry officials are worried about the growing number of backyard chickens that could become infected and spread avian flu to commercial farms.




"We have wild birds that are are full of virus. And if you expose your birds to these wild birds, they might get infected and ill," said Rodrigo Gallardo, a UC Davis researcher who studies avian influenza.


Gallardo advises the owners of backyard chickens to wear clean clothes and shoes to protect their flocks from getting infected. If an unusual number of chickens die, they should be tested for avian flu.


Ettamarie Peterson, a retired teacher in Petaluma, has a flock of about 50 chickens that produce eggs she sells from her backyard barn for 50 cents each.


"I'm very concerned because this avian flu is transmitted by wild birds, and there's no way I can stop the wild birds from coming through and leaving the disease behind," Peterson said. "If your flock has any cases of it, you have to destroy the whole flock."


Sunrise Farms, which was started by Weber's great-grandparents more than a century ago, was infected despite putting in place strict biosecurity measures to protect the flock.


"The virus got to the birds so bad and so quickly you walked in and the birds were just dead," Weber said. "Heartbreaking doesn't describe how you feel when you walk in and perfectly healthy young birds have been just laid out."


After euthanizing more than half a million chickens at Sunrise Farms, Weber and his employees spent the Christmas holiday discarding the carcasses. Since then, they've been cleaning out and disinfecting the hen houses.


Weber hopes the farm will get approval from federal regulators to bring chicks back to the farm this spring. Then it would take another five months before the hens are mature enough to lay eggs.


He feels lucky that two farms his company co-owns have not been infected and are still producing eggs for his customers. But recovering from the outbreak won't be easy.


"We have a long road ahead," Weber said. "We're going to make another run of it and try to keep this family of employees together because they've worked so hard to build this into the company that it is."

## Biden Returns to South Carolina, Determined to Win Back Black Voters

date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA

COLUMBIA, South carolina — U.S. President Joe Biden doesn't need to worry about his prospects in South Carolina's Democratic primary next week. He's got that locked up. 


He also knows he's not likely to win the solidly red state come November. South Carolina hasn't voted for a Democrat since 1976. 


Nonetheless, Biden spent the weekend in the state, intent on driving home two messages: He's loyal to the state that saved his campaign in 2020 and he's determined to win back Black voters here and elsewhere who were central to his election last time but are less enthused this go-round. 


"You're the reason I am president," Biden told attendees at the state party's fundraising dinner ahead of its first ever "first-in-the-nation" Democratic primary on February 3. "You're the reason Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. And you're the reason Donald Trump is a defeated former president. You're the reason Donald Trump is a loser. And you're the reason we're going to win and beat him again." 




Biden received raved applause and chants of "four more years" from attendees at the dinner, as he criticized his predecessor's policies and highlighted his efforts to support Black Americans. He was set to spend Sunday in the state where politics and faith are intertwined at a political event at St. John Baptist Church. 


Deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said of the primary that Biden's team was working to "blow this out of the water" by running up the score against long shot challengers. The Biden campaign also wants to learn lessons about activating Black voters — the backbone of the party — ahead of an expected 2024 rematch with Republican front-runner Donald Trump. 


Challenger invites Biden to pass torch


It was the first time Biden shared a stage with Representative Dean Phillips, a long-shot challenger for the Democratic nomination, who called on the president, 81, to step aside for a younger generation of leaders to take on Trump. 


"The numbers do not say things are looking good," Phillips said of Biden's poll numbers. "My invitation to President Biden is to pass the torch."




Struggling to hold the attention of the crowd — many of whom were holding Biden campaign signs ahead of the president's appearance — Phillips repeatedly asked the audience to quiet down and listen to him.


Phillips told The Associated Press he did not interact with Biden at the event, saying of Biden's staff, "No. I don't think they want him to see me." 


Supporters talk up accomplishments


Ahead of the dinner, Biden stopped into Regal Lounge Men's Barber & Spa in Columbia, greeting, owners, employees and customers mid-haircut at the barbershop. 


The president has been getting mixed reviews from some Black voters in the state that came through for him in 2020, including discontent over his failure to deliver on voting rights legislation and other issues. 


Last year, at the outset of Biden's reelection bid, conflicting views among the same South Carolina Democratic voters whose support had been so crucial to his nomination provided an early warning sign of the challenges he faces as he tries to revive his diverse winning coalition from 2020. 


Overall, just half of Black adults said they approved of Biden in a December poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs. That is compared with 86% in July 2021, a shift that is generating concern about the president's reelection prospects. 


APVoteCast, an extensive national survey of the electorate, also found that support for Republican candidates ticked up slightly among Black voters during the 2022 midterm elections, although Black voters overwhelmingly supported Democrats. 


The Biden campaign is running TV ads in South Carolina highlighting Biden initiatives that it hopes will boost enthusiasm among Black voters. 


"On his first day in office with a country in crisis, President Biden got to work — for us," the ad states. "Cutting Black child poverty in half, more money for Black entrepreneurs, millions of new good-paying jobs and he lowered the cost of prescription drugs." 


The campaign is spending more than $270,000 on the ads through the primary, according to tracking data. The Democratic National Committee also launched a six-figure ad campaign across South Carolina and Nevada, which is next on the Democratic primary calendar, to boost enthusiasm for Biden among Black and Latino voters. And first lady Jill Biden was in the state on Friday evening to rally voters. 


Biden's campaign has also hired staff in South Carolina to organize ahead of the primary and through the general election, although for nearly 50 years the state has picked a Republican for president. 


'We know Joe...Joe knows us'


Meanwhile, a pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, is airing an ad featuring Democratic Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina ticking through what he says are major Biden accomplishments such as reducing student loan debt and cutting insulin costs for older people. 


It was Clyburn's 2020 endorsement of his longtime friend Biden that helped the then-candidate score a thundering win in South Carolina's presidential primary. 


In the new advertisement, Clyburn references his late wife, Emily, who influenced his 2020 endorsement of Biden. She said that "if we wanted to win the presidency, we better nominate Joe Biden," Clyburn says in the ad. "She was right then, and she's still right today." 


Clyburn greeted Biden at the airport and accompanied him throughout his visit. 


While Trump has seen slightly improving levels of support among Black and Latino voters, Biden's team is more concerned that a lack of enthusiasm for Biden will depress turnout among voters who are pivotal to the Democratic coalition. 


Biden's team is using South Carolina as a proving ground, tracking which messages and platforms break through with voters. 


South Carolina, where Black voters make up a majority of the Democratic electorate, is now the first meaningful contest in the Democratic presidential race after the party reworked the party's nominating calendar at Biden's call. Leading off with Iowa and New Hampshire had long drawn criticism because the states are less diverse than the rest of the country. 


A co-chairman of Biden's reelection campaign, Clyburn has remained one of the president's most stalwart advocates in Congress, as well as in his home state. 


Frequently, he reminds people of the same message he delivered in his 2020 endorsement: "We know Joe, and Joe knows us." 


Biden's decision to campaign in the state "helps solidify South Carolina's place as the first in the nation primary moving forward," said Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler. 


It also provides Biden an opportunity to re-engage with Black voters who have connections that extend beyond South Carolina. 


"Obviously the diaspora is strong, familial ties are strong with other key swing states in the area like Georgia and North Carolina," Tyler said. 


This is Biden's second trip to South Carolina this month. He spoke earlier in the month at the pulpit of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, where nine Black parishioners were shot to death in 2015 by a white stranger they had invited to join their Bible study.

## US Appeals for Contributions to Haiti Security Mission

date: 2024-01-28, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States on Saturday appealed for urgent support for a U.N.-backed law-and-order mission to Haiti, which has been thrown into doubt after a Kenyan court ruled against Nairobi's plan to send its police to the gang-plagued nation.


"The United States' commitment to the Haitian people remains unwavering," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement.


"We reaffirm our support of ongoing international efforts to deploy a Multinational Security Support mission for Haiti... and renew our calls for the international community to urgently provide support for this mission."


Kenya had been meant to lead the mission but a High Court judge on Friday ruled that sending police to Haiti "contravenes the constitution and the law and is therefore unconstitutional, illegal and invalid."


The Kenyan government has vowed to challenge the decision, a move noted by Miller in his statement.


Nairobi had previously said it was ready to provide up to 1,000 personnel — an offer welcomed by the United States and other nations that had ruled out putting their own forces on the ground.


"It is urgent that the international community respond to the unprecedented levels of gang violence and destabilizing forces preying upon the Haitian people," Miller said.


"At the same time, we call for the restoration of democratic order through an inclusive political process in Haiti," he said, adding that the "only legitimate path to long-term peace and stability is through free and fair elections."


Haiti, the Western hemisphere's poorest nation, has been in turmoil for years, with armed gangs taking over parts of the country and unleashing brutal violence, leaving the economy and public health system in tatters.


The 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise plunged the country further into chaos. No elections have taken place since 2016 and the presidency remains vacant.


Haiti's foreign minister pleaded Thursday for the deployment plans to be accelerated, telling the U.N. Security Council that gang violence in the country was as barbaric as the horrors experienced in war zones.

## Tiny11 creates a 100MB version of Windows 11 by axing the windows

date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News

If you know your Windows history, you&#8217;ll know that the operating system got that name when it moved away from using pure MS-DOS and started using a graphical user interface to show things. As it turns out, you can force Windows 11 back to its legacy roots and reduce it back to a command-line interface. This is what the developer of Tiny11 has achieved, calling their new creation &#8220;Minwin.&#8221; The developer of Win11, NTDev, posted a video on YouTube about their project. There&#8217;s absolutely nothing flashy here; no Copilot, no Start menu, and definitely no UI. It&#8217;s as graphically complex as the Command Prompt, which meant that NTDev had to resort to fancy 00s-era ASCII logos to announce that Minwin was working. ↫ Simon Batt at XDA Definitely a neat proof-of-concept, and it shows just how modular Windows could be if only Microsoft allowed its users to take out the parts they don&#8217;t need. I wonder how close this is to Nano Server, an installation option for Windows Server you&#8217;ve probably never heard of. I also like the nod to MinWin, the informal codename Microsoft used internally to refer to an effort by a small number of expert Windows kernel engineers to untangle the spaghetti ball of dependencies that had sprouted between the various architectural layers of Windows. This project started around Vista, and eventually made it possible to make broader, sweeping changes to Windows without breaking things all over the place because the spaghetti ball of internal, low-level dependencies wasn&#8217;t mapped out.

## Two months in Servo: better inline layout, stable Rust, and more

date: 2024-01-28, from: OS News

Another month, another pile of improvement to Servo, the rendering engine written in Rust, originally a Mozilla project. This month the proof-of-concept browser UI got forward and backward buttons, making this bare-bones UI just a tiny bit more usable. Of course, the vast majority of changes and improvements are all focused on the actual rendering engine, which makes sense because Servo definitely isn&#8217;t ready for any prime time use &#8211; nor is anyone claiming it is. I&#8217;m incredibly curious to see where Servo goes in the future.

## Barman 3.10.0 Released

date: 2024-01-28, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com">EDB</a> is pleased to announce the release of Barman 3.10.0. </p>
<h2>Highlights of this release:</h2>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Limit the average bandwidth used by <code>barman-cloud-backup</code> when backing
 up to either AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage according to the value set by
 a new CLI option <code>--max-bandwidth</code>.</li>
<li>Add the new configuration option <code>lock_directory_cleanup</code>
 That enables cron to automatically clean up the barman_lock_directory
 from unused lock files.</li>
<li>Add support for a new type of configuration called <code>model</code>.
 The model acts as a set of overrides for configuration options
 for a given Barman server.</li>
<li>Add a new barman command <code>barman config-update</code> that allows the creation
 and the update of configurations using JSON</li>
<li>Related to this Barman release, <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/barman/blob/master/NEWS">pg_backup_api</a> has been updated and released to support these new features.  As a result, Barman now supports changes in the configuration whilst it's running. This pg-backup-api release adds the required endpoints to trigger that switch when requested.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug that caused <code>--min-chunk-size</code> to be ignored when using <code>barman-cloud-backup</code> as a hook script in Barman.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is also published in the <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/barman/blob/master/NEWS">NEWS</a> for Barman.</p>
<h3>About Barman</h3>
