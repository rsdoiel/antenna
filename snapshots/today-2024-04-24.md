## Ecologists Struggle to Get a Grip on ‘Keystone Species’

date: 2024-04-24, from: Quanta Magazine

More than 50 years after Bob Paine’s experiment with starfish, hundreds of species have been pronounced “keystones” in their ecosystems.

## Biden’s Plan to Jumpstart Offshore Wind

<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>A Saharan dust storm turned skies red in Greece • More heavy rain is expected in China’s flooded Guangdong province • Red Flag fire weather warnings are in place across much of New Mexico.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>
	1. Key takeaways from Tesla’s quarterly earnings report
</h3><p>
	Tesla reported first quarter earnings yesterday. The electric car company’s profits fell 55%, and revenue fell 9%. But shares rose more than 10% in after-hours trading following the shareholder update and earnings call. Here are a few things we learned from the report:
</p><ul>
<li>CEO Elon Musk said <strong>Tesla “should be thought of as an AI/robotics company,” </strong>and that “if you value Tesla as an auto company, that’s the wrong framework.”</li>
<li><strong>Plans for a sub-$30,000 EV</strong> haven’t been entirely scrapped, as previously reported. The company said it will “accelerate” the launch of new and more affordable models, but indicated “that any new, cheaper vehicle would not necessarily be entirely new nor unlock massive new savings through an all-new production process,” <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWPLsw3rgDz_W2tCQsv96F-0NW89-nNw5dgS7jN3Bm-863qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3lFM2yK_9TWk5rW3DcxDF9k5gFCW1Zt9LT5_H5B9W7hp-Vn7wyw21W8fL7Lx10dqwsVCWsnB4RtZ1TW1C8LqT8FkwDvW4MxQ-44Csc9mW8jDz2-4FR2rZW5qnj2_7kv4SgV4gskX63JJ1yVZ_vT21--prwN8Jcx2NVkrTjW1d-ZDg2N1b7fW4-bmTX8pW_ttW281MBb4yD9wnW4dC08p459pfmW5M49tP2z08VkW4_hbXy259WnkW34b7Dv4w18ZRW6lfJjz1v0SZwV9nMVl719KRZN41FcDdr9s33W6bKrFZ1fnf3fW2-TWL272VpthW4xrFf3395Vxtf8lJyVP04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin. The robotaxi, however, will rely on a new platform.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla’s energy business is growing</strong> faster than its car business. The company deployed just over 4 gigawatts of energy storage in the first quarter of the year, and its energy revenue was up 7% from a year ago. Profits from the business more than doubled.</li>
<li>Musk still wants to sell a “general purpose, bi-pedal, humanoid robot,” and said <strong>the Optimus robot</strong> would be in “limited production” in a factory doing “useful tasks” by the end of this year.</li>
</ul><h3>
	2. Biden administration plans to hold up to a dozen offshore wind auctions by 2028
</h3><p>
<span></span>The Interior Department today announced that it will hold up to <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWPLsw3rgDz_W2tCQsv96F-0NW89-nNw5dgS7jN3Bm-6F5nXHsW50kH_H6lZ3nnW5DsgR43sJCpdVTrRdc6DkXqkN5TXBxCs4z_DN4-kqMf5MbgFW2P_8zx2zBl26W7k2RW21H1q2fN2nS65jTfM00W49YdSw8nCpZWW66vRCV211vvvVLl9mG6QcDK1ML2DN0sjfhnW4Z42T87Px_skW2hJLlj35xhGRV1M47X3DmDLyW5QsCxR6zLHmqW63nsBr3RkFw9W8cyfGb4mST8cW4rj4r2587bPpW9lR4MR1LgD5sW78_F-W5y-X6rW7j-Zp85YMx7ZW23xHlg6Sj4hdVRmGxv9kfl0cW3_x1n52-xB3ZW8PGJ385Hw55rVbBTvY64-W5tN43Hs_9CLVMtW4wH3-M8n551JW8nQWkk7jPYjqW1v7ns_6rxDWgN21r0hcj_DtDW6K83291KfWxyf47cGcb04" target="_blank">12 offshore wind auctions</a> through 2028, with four of those auctions happening by the end of 2024. President Biden has a goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030, but the industry has been blown off course thanks to inflation and disrupted supply chains. The Interior Department has held four offshore wind auctions so far during Biden’s presidency. The new schedule is an attempt to “jump-start the fledgling offshore wind sector” by expanding development potential, <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWPLsw3rgDz_W2tCQsv96F-0NW89-nNw5dgS7jN3Bm-6Y5nXHsW5BWr2F6lZ3n3W8vhyWR42gGKXW2LJV116H1fhGN7rK7q25KFMtW5nKkPP1HD-qsN4DkxwdxkMMVW7RJLwD6j9kL2W39_NDH1PsLczW5b8t-M1ff1nzW837yZn8j2QCZW8ym4CY202fRdN4rYg2ZdBFzmW16Mkh26BTHQ5W7cGykJ4w3_72W37J8f31_8X_fVQVyGg7VB-xXW1DzVM72Kf33KW1bYXPs7f522DW1pFD-F6vknQbW5Gmg7q80kqnLW1fQ5l86QWtPSW3CQnbr7Xtw_cW1NZ2yf8MgTYbW2rjvmS6zVQQ2N1cGXs5KGNntW5vFDpr1VZJ_XW5rW-xh15y8CSW6M57PT80WRcKW5SsWxw3JdFJYW4Wg7rL2dt-mCW3wh8Kb31RNsTW8GQZ6z2R_kbCN7rzVGfR_lBxW7JJ8H-8M_Ns-W2-mJcw46NR-yf5L5jPx04" target="_blank">reported</a> <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>. “Our offshore wind leasing schedule will provide predictability to help developers and communities plan ahead and will provide the confidence needed to continue building on the tremendous offshore wind supply chain and manufacturing investments that we've already seen,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.

<span></span>3. Poll: Few climate-concerned voters know about Biden’s climate policies
</h3><p>
	In the last month alone, $37 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act has gone toward climate projects. That amount “exceeds what the recent foreign aid bill will give to Israel, Taiwan, and humanitarian aid in Gaza, combined,” <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VWPLsw3rgDz_W2tCQsv96F-0NW89-nNw5dgS7jN3Bm-863qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3pKW8_yc5556JDQgW3D689w7wcBpfVpLvnT8TlDwJW6XCQxX2vj4LhVYY-VV13h3__N7CFDF49n4_bW1zg7Gw7mB2rSW7SWLlZ7cQQZYW3zN1dC6MqTj4VBtc6H2nh0RgN6gPRY7rkmlDW4LYy7d1l1t-LW14x8tM7KS3x6W6BJBtL9j5St1W92f3m-6kqwbtN7DYlmT81nGwW6LXHfX4pt62qVLswND8dJ35-W6CdQr57xYVtVW917WpN9dVdBNW9g2LYl7fsSryW6fMJfp2x-z_ZW36_Tfh8h35SBN2KDZ-l5Vnb8W33J0_R4MKJ4cW15wZcL5y1BXwf3JDb2H04" target="_blank">reported Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer</a>. As the election approaches, the Biden administration is spending funds from the IRA much faster than it was last year. But it seems President Biden’s climate investments and emission-slashing initiatives aren’t getting through to Americans.

About 45% of respondents said climate change is a very important issue, but just 10% of those said they had heard or read “a lot” about Biden’s climate policies. And 42% said the administration hadn’t done enough on the issue.
</p><p>
	More than half of respondents said the outcome of the November election would have no effect on climate change.

The UN-led session is the second-to-last meeting before the treaty on reducing plastic pollution has to be finalized later this year, so the stakes are high, as are tensions between oil-producing nations and other countries that want to see plastic production dramatically reduced.

The range, at about 293 miles, is relatively low but the sticker price, at about $150,000, is very high. It’ll be on sale in the U.S. in the second half of 2024. Here are some early reactions:

## How I tricked iOS into giving me EU DMA features

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

In iOS 17.4, Apple introduced a new system called eligibilityd. This works with countryd (which you might have heard about when it first appeared in iOS 16.2) and the Apple ID system to decide where you physically are. The idea is that multiple sources need to agree on where you are, before giving you access to features such as those mandated by the Digital Markets Act. ↫ Adam Demasi The way Adam Demasi managed to convince Apple his very much Australian iPhone in Australia was, in fact, a European Union iPhone in the European Union was by making sure not a single wireless signal managed to escape the device. He had to disable location services, insert an Italian SIM, set up a pfSense Wi-Fi router using the regulatory country of Italy, and go into his basement where there&#8217;s no mobile signal. Between all these steps, the phone was reset multiple times. And then, and only then, did the iPhone think it was in the European Union, with all the benefits that entails. Demasi has no idea which of these steps are actually needed, but the process of figuring this all out is ongoing, and more information is sure to be discovered as smart people sink their teeth into the process by which Apple determines where an iPhone is from.

## Jigar Shah Has a Lot of Money to Throw Around

date: 2024-04-24, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjA2NjE2My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NzQ4MzE3MH0.9f_lW3kkvD5A95XJJSQvMDH525oyMUc-aLLGmwZbhdw/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Jigar Shah might have more control over America’s new wave of industrial policy — not to mention its climate policy — than anyone not named Joe Biden. And he’s not even a Cabinet-level official. As director of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which is akin to its in-house bank, Shah oversees how roughly $400 billion in lending authority will be spent. That money will help finance new EV factories, geothermal wells, carbon capture sites, and more.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode, Rob sits down with Shah to discuss the philosophy that he brings to his role. When financing new projects — many of which are the first of their kind — how does he think about cash flow, about technological innovation, about risk? Robinson Meyer is executive editor of Heatmap News; Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineering professor at Princeton, is off this week.

</iframe></center><p>
Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>
	Robinson Meyer:</strong> I think one thing you’ve said often is that we have — and you alluded to at the beginning of the conversation — is that we haven’t built manufacturing in this country, basically, for 40 years. I think one note we’ve seen both from the president and from the partisan laws passed by Congress and the president — but also, frankly, from a more bipartisan set of lawmakers — is that there’s a lot of eagerness for that to change. So from your point of view as someone kind of in the weeds every day, what needs to change for the U.S. to build manufacturing and heavy industry domestically again?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jigar Shah: </strong>Well, let’s start by saying that I think that the BIL and IRA that’s passed has been a huge success story, right? We’ve gotten 500 announcements of new factories in the United States. And so, these are communities like the one that I grew up in, that had the seventh largest steel mill in the country that shut down while I was there. And all of the people who went to high school there expected to have a job there, and they don’t. Right? These are folks who are pretty pissed off about the fact that their lot in life, really, was destined to not have family-sustaining jobs for 40 years, right?<br/>
<br/>
And so now we’re giving people hope again that, for folks who have high school educations, that they can actually support their families and do these things, right? So in that perspective, we’re winning, right?
	<br/>
<br/>
But on the other side, we still have a lot more work to do, right? So when you think about the underlying conventional wisdom, the conventional wisdom is that you’re going to start a factory, China’s going to dump product in the United States and going to put you out of business, right? And so the local bank is saying, prove to me that China’s not going to dump product and put you out of business. Those old habits die hard, right?
	<br/>
<br/>
Now, the president has put together all sorts of belts and suspenders, but I don’t think that’s clear. I’ll give you an example. So in the EV supply chain — we have an extraordinary amount of lithium in this country. We made the announcements at Thacker Pass and Rhyolite Ridge, as well as recycling for Li-Cycle and Redwood. But we’ve got additional abilities to get lithium over in Arkansas and Salton Sea in California.
	<br/>
<br/>
And a lot of folks are saying, lithium prices are down 70% from their highs, right? So therefore there’s no way you can make it work right now. Lithium was $5,000 a unit in 2020. Today it’s $20,000 a unit. It was as high as $80,000 — $20,000 is still 4x what it was in 2020. And so there’s a way to make it profitable, but we also have the 30D program where a lot of automakers get incentives to buy locally for domestic content.
	<br/>
<br/>
And so I feel like there’s just so much in the IRA, that the belts and suspenders approach that the administration took is not something that most people understand. And as a result, a lot of dollars are not moving from the commercial markets. We’ve got to step in and move them.

## OpenBSD as a daily driver

date: 2024-04-24, from: OS News

I always like it when I can link to an article written by an OSNews, and this time it&#8217;s even relevant to me as I&#8217;m exploring OpenBSD myself. OSNews reader and silver Patreon supporter Morgan has written an article about using OpenBSD as a daily driver. OpenBSD is forever tied in first place with Void Linux as my favorite desktop OS. This is particularly funny because OpenBSD isn’t “just a desktop OS”; in its purest form, the base installation without any installed packages, it makes for an excellent Ethernet router, firewall, or web server. It even ships with its own fork of X11 called Xenocara, along with fvwm2 and its own calm window manager, so there’s a rudimentary desktop OS in there too. With that said, in 2024 there is no such thing as a fully functioning desktop computer or workstation without at least a web browser of some kind, and if you’re adding packages you may as well build a full desktop system to suit your needs. So how do you go from the amazing but unfortunately limited base install to a “daily driver” workstation operating system? There are many ways to do this, and I will present a couple of paths I take depending on the hardware and use case involved. Before I do that, a bit of prep is necessary to get OpenBSD into more of a desktop OS mode. ↫ Morgan I&#8217;ll be using this guide over the coming days to make sure I end up with something usable. I still haven&#8217;t decided on what desktop environment I want to go for &#8211; I&#8217;m not interested in running GNOME or KDE, so Xfce is probably the most likely option. I&#8217;d also love to try out LXQt, but it seems the version OpenBSD has in its repositories is very, very outdated (1.0.0 from years ago, when 2.0.0 was just released). There&#8217;s a small chance I might suck it up and use one of those &#8220;build your own desktop environment&#8221; options, but I have no idea which one I should go for.

## US Senate passes bill to force TikTok divestment or ban

date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted late Tuesday to send legislation to President Joe Biden that would require Chinese owner ByteDance to divest the popular short video app's U.S. assets within about nine months or face a

Ban.


The measure, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday, has been driven by concerns that China could access Americans' data or surveil them with the app and Biden has said he will sign it into law.


"For years we've allowed the Chinese Communist party to control one of the most popular apps in America that was dangerously shortsighted," said Senator Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee. "A new law is going to require its Chinese owner to sell the app. This is a good move for America."


TikTok, which says it has not shared and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, has argued the law amounts to a ban that would violate the U.S. free speech rights of its users.


The company did not immediately comment but over the weekend, it told its employees that it would quickly go to court to try to block the legislation.


"We'll continue to fight, as this legislation is a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of the 170 million Americans on TikTok... This is the beginning, not the end of this long process," TikTok told employees on Saturday in an email seen by Reuters.


The Senate voted 79 to 18 in favor of the bill.

## 23 Apr 2024

date: 2024-04-24, from: Miguel de Icaza's blog

<h1 id="embeddable-game-engine">Embeddable Game Engine</h1>
<p><img
src="https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftGodotDocs/images/SwiftGodot%20Header.png"
align="right" width=240>
Many years ago, when working at Xamarin, where we were building cross-platform
libraries for mobile developers, we wanted to offer both 2D and 3D gaming
capabilities for our users in the form of adding 2D or 3D content to their
mobile applications.</p>
<p>For 2D, we contributed and developed assorted Cocos2D-inspired libraries.</p>
<p>For 3D, the situation was more complex. We funded a few over the years, and we
contributed to others over the years, but nothing panned out (the
history of this is worth a dedicated post).</p>
<p>Around 2013, we looked around, and there were two contenders at the
time, one was an embeddable engine with many cute features but not great UI
support called Urho, and the other one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)">Godot</a>, which had a great IDE, but
did not support being embedded.</p>
<p>I reached out to Juan at the time to discuss whether Godot could be turned into
such engine.   While I tend to take copious notes of all my meetings, those
notes sadly were gone as part of the Microsoft acquisition, but from what I can
remember Juan told me, &quot;Godot is not what you are looking for&quot; in two dimensions,
there were no immediate plans to turn it into an embeddable library, and it was
not as advanced as Urho, so he recommended that I go with Urho.</p>
<p>We invested heavily in binding Urho and created
<a href="https://github.com/xamarin/urho">UrhoSharp</a> that would go into becoming a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/bring-3d-models-life-augmented-reality-urhosharp/">great
3D library for our C# users</a> and worked not only on every desktop and mobile
platform, but we did a ton of work to make it great for AR and VR headsets.
Sadly, Microsoft's management left UrhoSharp to die.</p>
<p>Then, the maintainer of Urho stepped down, and Godot became one of the most
popular open-source projects in the world.</p>
<p>Last year, @Faolan-Rad <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/72883">contributed a patch to Godot</a> to turn it into a library
that could be embedded into applications.   I used this library to build
<a href="https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftGodotKit">SwiftGodotKit</a> and have been
very happy with it ever since - allowing people to embed Godot content into
their application.</p>
<p>However, the patch had severe limitations; it could only ever run one Godot game as
an embedded system and could not do much more.   The folks at <a href="https://www.smirk.gg">Smirk
Software</a> wanted to take this further. They wanted to host
independent Godot scenes in their app and have more control over those so
they could sprinkle Godot content at their heart's content on their mobile app (<a href="https://x.com/JoshBromberg1/status/1721564103859114132">demo</a>)</p>
<p>They funded some initial work to do this and hired <a href="https://migeran.com">Gergely
Kis's company</a> to do this work.</p>
<p>Gergely demoed this work at GodotCon last year.   I came back very excited from
GodotCon and I decided to turn my <a href="https://x.com/migueldeicaza/status/1723765594653167892">prototype Godot on iPad</a> into a <a href="https://blog.la-terminal.net/igodot/">complete
product</a>.</p>
<p>One of the features that I needed was the ability to embed chunks of Godot in
discrete components in my iPad UI, so we worked with Gergely to productize and
polish this patch for general consumption.</p>
<p>Now, there is a <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/90510">complete patch under review</a> to allow people to embed arbitrary
Godot scenes into their apps.   For SwiftUI users, this means that you can embed a Godot scene into a <code>View</code> and display and control it at will.</p>
<p>Hopefully, the team will accept this change into Godot, and once this is done, I will
update SwiftGodotKit to get these new capabilities to Swift users (bindings for
other platforms and languages are left as an exercise to the reader).</p>
<p>It only took a decade after talking to Juan, but I am back firmly in Godot land.</p>

## White House updates national suicide prevention strategy

date: 2024-04-24, from: VOA News USA

washington — The White House on Tuesday unveiled an updated national strategy on suicide prevention that includes more emphasis on health equity and diversity and the mental-health impact of social media, revising its decade-old plan amid a national rise in suicide rates.


Second gentleman Doug Emhoff launched the new strategy at the White House, which he prefaced with words of comfort and encouragement.


"It's OK to talk about this, as tough as this topic is," he said. "So, that's why it's good that we're all here today together. It's important we do this, because as we all know, suicide affects everyone. Doesn't matter your age, race, gender or where you live. It impacts all of us."


The U.S. remains in a small clique of about 40 mostly high-income nations that have national plans to combat a menace that has left no society unscarred.


In a push for more countries to develop national strategies in 2018, the World Health Organization noted that "only a few countries in the low-income and middle-income categories have adopted a national suicide prevention strategy, even though 79% of suicides occur in these settings."


American health professionals told VOA a national plan is essential to tackling the problem. 


"The new national strategy focuses on a "whole of society" approach, which is unique —and critical — because no single entity alone can reduce suicide rates. But together, we have a real opportunity for impact," Hannah Wesolowski, chief advocacy officer of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, told VOA in an email.


Doctors who worked with the White House on the plan noted that not all its recommendations are strictly medical. Many are social and involve being more open about a matter that is often seen as taboo. 


"When it comes to a national strategy, you're actually looking to employ a multipronged approach," Dr. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer at the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, told VOA. "So, you would be looking to increase your mental health professional workforce that is culturally aligned with the population.


"But you'd also be looking to other things that low- and middle-income countries can do more readily, such as increasing interpersonal connectedness in schools and in workplaces — really these community-based approaches that have been found to be incredibly effective at reducing suicides. So, things like addressing loneliness, addressing interpersonal violence."


American actor Ashley Judd, who spoke at the White House on Tuesday, also stressed the importance of legitimizing mental illness. Her mother, musician Naomi Judd, committed suicide in 2022. 


"She won several Grammys, and she left country music better than she found it," Judd said of her mother, who was 76. "She also lived most of her life with an untreated and undiagnosed mental illness that lied to her and stole from her. And it stole from our family, and she deserved better."


Another issue the updated plan wrestled with is a uniquely American one. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 55% of American suicides are committed with firearms. 


"There is a very strong section on firearm suicide prevention in the national strategy," Moutier said, noting that the federal strategy mentions the important role of state-level red flag laws that would restrict firearms access for buyers who may harm themselves or others. 


The new strategy also emphasizes the value of "lived experience" — the validity of survivors' stories and those of their loved ones, who are scarred by the suicide. 


Musician Aloe Blacc spoke Tuesday of how he uses music to heal after the 2018 suicide of his close friend, Swedish electronica artist Tim Bergling – better known by his stage name, Avicii.




On the anniversary of his friend's death, Blacc recorded a version of his hit, "Wake Me Up."He also recorded a version he sang in Mandarin and Spanish. 


And on Tuesday, Blacc, sitting in the high-ceilinged, marble-walled room on the White House campus, burst into spontaneous song. His warm tenor filled the cavernous room as he sang a gospel standard, "This Little Light of Mine."


"Just remember," he said. "You are the light."


Blacc offered some simple advice to those who themselves may be struggling or know someone who is. 


"I want to encourage all of us here today and all of us watching to recognize the role that we can play, the positive role that we can play in someone else's life," he said. 


Or, as Wesolowski said, "The most important thing we can do is show up. ...The action of reaching out is more important than the words you say, and sometimes it can make all the difference."


The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention shared with VOA this list of international suicide hotlines.

## Elon Musk Would Like to Talk About AI

date: 2024-04-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjA3OTYxMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxNTgzNzQ4MX0.7ylvpFSyc5A1v2iTN51OJPPKGVZvQLjfcD5wmTMX55U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Tesla doesn’t want to talk about its cars — or at least, not about the cars that have steering wheels and human drivers. </p><p>Despite weeks of reports about Tesla’s manufacturing and sales woes — price cuts, recalls, and whether a new, cheaper model would ever come to fruition — CEO Elon Musk and other Tesla executives devoted their quarterly earnings call largely to the company's autonomous driving software. Musk promised that the long-awaited program would revolutionize the auto industry (“We’re putting the actual ‘auto’ in automobile,” as he put it) and lead to the “biggest asset appreciation in history” as existing Tesla vehicles got progressively better self-driving capabilities. </p><p>In other Tesla news, car sales are falling, and a new, cheaper vehicle will not be constructed on an all-new platform and manufacturing line, which would instead by reserved for a from-the-ground-up autonomous vehicle.</p><p>Here are five big takeaways from the company's earnings and conference call.</p><h3>1. Tesla’s car business is slowing down ...</h3><br/><p>The company reported that its “total automotive revenues” came in at $17.4 billion in the first quarter, down 13% from a year ago. Its overall revenues of $21.3 billion, meanwhile, were down 9% from a year ago. The earnings announcement included a number of explanations for the slowdown, which was even worse than Wall Street analysts had expected.</p><p>Among the reasons Tesla cited for the disappointing results were arson at its Berlin factory, the obstruction to Red Sea shipping due to Houthi attacks from Yemen, plus a global slowdown in electric vehicle sales “as many carmakers prioritize hybrids over EVs.” The combined effects of these unfortunate events led the company to undertake a well-publicized series of price cuts and other sweeteners for buyers, which dug further into Tesla’s bottom line. Tesla’s chief financial officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said that the company’s free cash flow was negative more than $2 billion, largely due to a “mismatch” between its manufacturing and actual sales, which led to a buildup of car inventory.</p><p>The bad news was largely expected — the company’s shares had fallen 40% so far this year leading up to the first quarter earnings, and the past few weeks have featured a <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-robotaxi" target="_self"><u>steady drumbeat of bad news</u></a> from the automaker, including layoffs and a major <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-cybertruck-recall" target="_self"><u>recall</u></a>. The company’s profits of $1.1 billion were down by more than 50%, short of Wall Street’s expectations — and yet still, Tesla shares were up more than 10% in after-hours trading following the shareholder update and earnings call.</p><h3>2. ... but that’s fine, because Tesla is really an AI company</h3><br/><p>The strange thing about Tesla is that it makes the overwhelming majority of its money from selling cars, but has become the world’s most valuable car company thanks to investors thinking that it’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-earnings-ai-elon-musk" target="_blank">more of an artificial intelligence company</a>. <span></span>It’s not uncommon for Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his executives to start talking about their Full Self-Driving technology and autonomous driving goals when the company’s existing business has hit a rough patch, and today was no exception.</p><p>Tesla’s value per share was about 33 times its earnings per share by the end of trading on Monday, comparable to how investors evaluate software companies that they expect to grow quickly and expand profitability in the future. Car companies, on the other hand, tend to have much lower valuations compared to their earnings — Ford’s multiple is 12, for instance, and GM’s is 6.</p><p>Musk addressed this gap directly on the company’s earnings call. He said that Tesla “should be thought of as an AI/robotics company,” and that “if you value Tesla as an auto company, that’s the wrong framework.” To emphasize just how much the company is pivoting around its self-driving technology, Musk said that “if somebody believes Tesla is not going to solve autonomy they should not be an investor in the company.”<br/></p><p>One reason investors value Tesla so differently relative to its peers is that they do, actually, expect the company will <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-earnings-ai-elon-musk" target="_self"><u>make a lot of money</u></a> using artificial intelligence. No doubt with that in mind, executives made sure to let everyone know that its artificial intelligence spending was immense: The company’s free cash flow may have been negative more than $2 billion, but $1 billion of that was in spending on AI infrastructure. The company also said that it had “increased AI training compute by more than 130%” in the first quarter.</p><p>“The future is not only electric, but also autonomous,” the company’s investor update said. “We believe scaled autonomy is only possible with data from millions of vehicles and an immense AI training cluster. We have, and continue to expand, both.”</p><p>Musk described the company’s FSD 12 self-driving software as “profound” and said that “it’s only a matter of time before we exceed the reliability of humans, and not much time at that.”</p><h3>3. There will be some kind of new car, and it will be ahead of schedule, but that’s all Musk is willing to say</h3><br><p>The biggest open question about Tesla is what would happen with its long-promised Model 2, a sub-$30,000 EV that would, in theory, have mass appeal. <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-scraps-low-cost-car-plans-amid-fierce-chinese-ev-competition-2024-04-05/" target="_blank">reported</a> that the project had been cancelled and that Tesla was instead devoting its resources to another long-promised project, a self-driving ride-hailing vehicle called the “robotaxi.” </p><p>Musk tweeted that <em>Reuters</em> was “lying” but never directly denied the report or identified what was wrong with it, instead saying that the robotaxi would be unveiled in August. He <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1780376546148327690" target="_blank"><u>later followed up</u></a> to say that “going balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move. Everything else is like variations on a horse carriage.”</p><p>Before the call, Wall Street analysts were begging for a confirmation that newer, cheaper models besides a robotaxi were coming.</p><p>“If Tesla does not come out with a Model 2 the next 12 to 18 months, the second growth wave will not come,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note last week. “Musk needs to recommit to the Model 2 strategy ALONG with robotaxis but it CANNOT be solely replaced by autonomy.”</p><p>Anyone who expected to get their answers on today’s call, though, was likely kidding themselves.</p><p>Tesla announced today it had updated its planned vehicle line-up to “accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025,” and that “these new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms.” Musk added on the company’s earnings call that a new model would not be “contingent on any new factory or massive new production line.”</p><p><span></span>Some analysts attributed the share pricing popping after hours to this line, although it’s unclear just how new this new car would be.</p><p>Tesla’s shareholder update indicated that any new, cheaper vehicle would not necessarily be entirely new nor unlock massive new savings through an all-new production process. “This update may result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times,” the update said.</p><p>Of the robotaxi, meanwhile, the company said it will “continue to pursue a revolutionary ‘unboxed’ manufacturing strategy,” indicating that just the ride-hailing vehicle would be built entirely on a new platform.</p><p>Musk also discussed how a robotaxi network could work, saying that it would be a combination of Tesla-operated robotaxis and owners putting their own cars into the ride-hailing fleet. When asked directly about its schedule for a $25,000 car, Musk quickly pivoted to discussing autonomy, saying that when Teslas are able to self-drive without supervision, it will be “the biggest asset appreciation in history,” as existing Teslas became self-driving.<br/><br/>When asked whether any new vehicles would “tweaks” or “new models,” Musk dodged the question, saying that they had said everything they had planned to say on the new cars.</p><h3>4. Energy and charging are growing at a nice clip</h3><br><p>One bright spot on the company’s numbers was the growth in its sales of energy systems, which are tilting more and more toward the company’s battery offerings.</p><p>Tesla said it deployed just over 4 gigawatts of energy storage in the first quarter of the year, and that its energy revenue was up 7% from a year ago. Profits from the business more than doubled.</p><p>Tesla’s energy business is growing faster than its car business, and Musk said it will continue to grow “significantly faster than the car business” going forward.</p><p>Revenues from “services and others,” which includes the company’s charging network, was up by a quarter, as more and more other electric vehicle manufacturers adopt Tesla’s charging standard.</p><h3>5. Oh, and robots</h3><br><p>Another speculative Tesla project is Optimus, which the company describes as a “general purpose, bi-pedal, humanoid robot capable of performing tasks that are unsafe, repetitive or boring.” Like many robotics projects, the most the public has seen of Optimus has been intriguing video content, but Musk said that it was doing “factory tasks in the lab” and that it would be in “limited production” in a factory doing “useful tasks” by the end of this year. External sales could begin “by the end of next year,” Musk said.</p><p>But as with any new Tesla project, these dates may be aspirational. Musk described them as “just guesses,” but also said that Optimus could “be more valuable than everything else combined.”</p></br></br></br>

## Biden’s Climate Cash Is Finally Pouring In

date: 2024-04-23, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8zOTIzMDQzNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczOTAxMTcwOX0.U0EexC_DlnKCohJD5GCtub5TllaY4Vz3ouuCqlHku44/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">It took a year and a half, but over the past month, money from the Inflation Reduction Act has started to flow out in earnest. Among the grants given just in the past four weeks are:</p><p>$20 million for ice cream factories in Tennessee and Vermont so they can replace their natural gas boilers with climate-friendly ones.</p><p>$51 million for a manufacturing plant that makes bathroom faucets and showerheads in Arizona.</p><p>And $6.97 billion to stand up a new green community bank that will help small farms, small businesses, households, and schools replace fossil fuels in their buildings and install electric vehicle chargers.</p><p>The size of these IRA programs can be difficult to put into perspective, but here’s one way of looking at it: The $37 billion in climate funding spent over the past month <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/us/politics/house-foreign-aid-bill.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceeds</u></a> what the recent foreign aid bill will give to Israel, Taiwan, and humanitarian aid in Gaza, combined.</p><p>As the election approaches, the Biden administration is spending funds from the IRA much faster than it was last year. As of October 2023, a Heatmap analysis <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding" target="_self"><u>found,</u></a> only $11.8 billion of the law’s roughly $110 billion in grant funds had been spent. What’s been awarded in <em><em>just the past month</em></em> represents about a quarter of the total grant funding allocated under the law.</p><p>Most of that comes from the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion pot of money meant to seed green banks around the country. The bulk of its awards — $20 billion — went to three coalitions — Climate United Fund, Coalition for Green Capital, and Power Forward Communities — made up of nonprofits, state-level green banks, and community development financial institutions, which are a type of federally certified nonprofit bank. </p><p>They’ll use that money to invest in new solar farms, decarbonize homes and apartment buildings, and make communities more resilient to extreme weather and other climate impacts. The returns from those projects will then go back to the coalition and allow them to fund more projects over time. If successful, that will keep the $20 billion cycling in the economy long after other IRA funding has dried up.</p><p>Many of the projects funded over the past month work this way, Sam Ricketts, a veteran of Jay Inslee’s presidential campaign and the cofounder of the climate consulting firm C2 Strategies, told me. They are meant to unleash more funding than their dollar amounts would suggest, getting private investors to match or exceed the government’s investment. “You look at EPA’s $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — they talk about each of those dollars leveraging seven more. We’re talking about a massive transformation here,” he said.</p><p>“With the industrial decarbonization program” — a $10 billion set of awards to more than 130 companies, funded with <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-6-billion-transform-americas-industrial-sector" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$6 billion of IRA money</u></a> — “the number that DOE is touting isn’t $6 billion. It’s $20 billion, because all the projects require cost sharing. That money is going to leverage much more” investment, Ricketts said. (The total funding amount also represents awards from the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-4-billion-tax-credits-build-clean-energy-supply" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>48C tax credit,</u></a> which is meant to help build new energy and critical mineral projects in the United States.)</p><p>The industrial sector is expected to be the economy’s most emissions-intensive sector by the middle of this decade. The slew of new projects funded by the Energy Department include first-of-a-kind efforts to build facilities that will accomplish key industrial processes — including <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-chemicals-and-refining" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>chemical</u></a> and <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-cement-and-concrete" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cement</u></a> production, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-iron-and-steel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ironmaking</u></a>, and even <a href="https://www.energy.gov/oced/industrial-demonstrations-program-selections-award-negotiations-heat#foodbev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>glass bottlemaking</u></a> — while producing vastly less carbon pollution than facilities make today.</p><p>“The cool thing about each of these programs is they’re all creating new terrain. [The EPA Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund] is going to be opening up new market segments, in some cases creating entirely new markets for sustained, leveraged, and recycled public investment in clean energy,” Ricketts said. “The industrial decarbonization programs are first-of-a-kind inroads into a sector that has traditionally been called hard to abate.”</p><p>Yet another new EPA program, dubbed “Solar for All,” will spend $7 billion to help 900,000 households get rooftop solar or join a community solar project. It’s joined by the <a href="https://www.acc.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>American Climate Corps</u></a>, another new IRA program that will train and employ 20,000 young people to work on conservation or clean energy projects. </p><p>At an Earth Day event in a Virginia park on Monday, President Joe Biden bragged about the Solar for All and American Climate Corps programs. “You'll get paid to fight climate change, learning how to install those solar panels, fight wildfires, rebuild wetlands, weatherize homes, and so much more,” he said.</p><p>Biden is “is overseeing the single biggest federal investment in tackling the climate crisis in our nation's history,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at the event. </p><p>The IRA’s more than $100 billion in grant programs do not represent all — or even most — of what the climate law will eventually spend into the economy. The overwhelming majority of the law’s support for decarbonization will come in the form of tax credits and other payments made to households and companies. These subsidies, which by some estimates <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-inflation-reduction-acts-benefits-and-costs#:~:text=That%20same%20month%2C%20Goldman%20Sachs,trillion%20from%202023%20to%202032." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exceed</u></a> $1 trillion, will help build new wind and solar farms, manufacture grid-scale batteries and electric vehicles, and refine minerals needed for zero-carbon technologies.</p><p>Data on the uptake of these tax credits and subsidies is not yet available. In February, <a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/transcript-shift-key-episode-three-ira" target="_self"><u>an analysis</u></a> from three independent modeling organizations found that the IRA was decarbonizing the vehicle fleet at roughly the expected pace, but that carbon reductions from the power grid lagged behind what was expected. </p><p>While rich communities can sometimes fund the kind of weatherization or decarbonization projects paid for by these new green banks by raising revenue or taking out bonds, that’s not a possibility for poor communities, he said. “This is still new territory,” Advait Arun, an energy finance researcher at the Center for Public Enterprise, told me. “It’s written and structured in a way that’s meant to mobilize private investment that wouldn’t get to these communities on their own.”</p><p>The new EPA program will also pay for “technical assistance,” which will teach local nonprofit, government, and banking leaders how to <em><em>think </em></em>about financing and managing long-term clean energy and climate projects. </p><p>“This is an unprecedented infusion to ensure that these projects that we want for local decarbonization and resilience actually reach the communities that need them,” Arun said.</p><p>Many of the IRA’s incentives can — and likely will — be stacked on top of each other, and the same projects may be able to qualify for grants, loan programs, and tax incentives. So a community solar project that is funded by the EPA green bank will also qualify for its tax credits. So will a large-scale building retrofit or a geothermal project. Because those tax credits cover a larger share of projects in low-income communities, they could sometimes cover more than half a project, Ricketts said. </p><p>“The money’s coming. The dollars are here,” Ricketts told me. And they’re not going to stop.</p><p>“This cavalry is going to be followed by an even bigger force, which is the tax incentives,” he said. “You’ve got the right hand jab of grants, and you’ve got the big left hook of tax incentives. And combined are the fists of climate-fighting fury.”</p>

## The man who killed Google Search

date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News

These emails — which I encourage you to look up — tell a dramatic story about how Google’s finance and advertising teams, led by Raghavan with the blessing of CEO Sundar Pichai, actively worked to make Google worse to make the company more money. This is what I mean when I talk about the Rot Economy — the illogical, product-destroying mindset that turns the products you love into torturous, frustrating quasi-tools that require you to fight the company’s intentions to get the service you want. ↫ Edward Zitron Quite the read.

## Myanmar junta slams US aid plan

date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Myanmar’s ruling junta, the State Administrative Council, is criticizing a U.S. aid package that is being funneled through opponents of the regime, saying the United States should consider whether its actions amount to support for terrorism. 


The assistance marks the first implementation of the BURMA Act, part of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act aimed at helping pro-democracy forces battling the SAC. 


Under the act, the aid is intended to strengthen federalism in Myanmar by providing nonlethal assistance to armed groups, helping pro-democracy organizations, assisting aid organizations operating from Thailand, and financing investigations of junta human rights violations. The aid is restricted to ensure it does not benefit the SAC or any entity affiliated with the Myanmar military. 


“We believe the U.S. is manipulating Myanmar to counter China's influence in the region,” the junta said in a statement provided to VOA on March 29. “Despite the U.S. presenting itself as a champion of democracy, the aid disproportionately benefits Myanmar's opposition groups, particularly the National Unity Government (NUG) and the People's Defense Force (PDF).” 


The NUG is the opposition’s shadow government; the PDF is made up of civilian armed groups battling the military. 




The junta statement calls on the United States to review its aid allocation “to reassess whether their actions, which some label as terrorism, represent a legitimate path to reclaiming power.” 


The junta, which has killed and imprisoned thousands of people since overthrowing the democratically elected government in February 2021, accuses the NUG and PDF of responsibility for the civilian deaths. The statement did not elaborate on the charge that U.S. support for resistance groups in Myanmar is linked to Myanmar’s adversarial relationship with China. 


The promise of the BURMA Act 


The Burma Unified Through Rigorous Military Accountability Act, commonly called the BURMA Act, says it aims to “continue to support the people of Burma in their struggle for democracy, human rights, and justice.” 


It identifies specific resistance groups as beneficiaries, including the NUG, and the National Unity Consultative Council, or NUCC, which comprises several opposition groups. 


Also named are the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, which is made up of members of the ousted Myanmar parliament; the civil disobedience movement; "and other entities in Burma and in other countries” that seek to “bring about an end to the military junta’s rule.” 


The act promises to “hold accountable perpetrators of human rights violations,” and to “hold accountable the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China.” 


It provides $75 million for refugee assistance programs, including in Thailand and India, and $25 million for “technical support and non-lethal assistance” to the NUG and PDF. Smaller amounts are earmarked for governance programs, documentation of atrocities, and assistance to political prisoners, Rohingya and deserters from the junta’s military. 




The Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority group, have faced persecution and discrimination in Myanmar for decades. In 2017, a military crackdown by the Myanmar army forced hundreds of thousands of Rohingya to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, seeking refuge from the violence and persecution. 


The act authorizes appropriations to be allocated annually from fiscal years 2023 through 2027, with $121 million earmarked for FY 2024.  


Process of the funding 


During debate on the bill, the U.S. House of Representatives initially proposed a more limited $50 million aid package but agreed to the larger sum advocated by the Senate before final passage. 


"We are pleased with the $121 million proposed by the Senate, instead of the $50 million proposed by the House. However, we believe this amount is insufficient, and should be closer to $300 million to meet the humanitarian needs on the ground,” said James Shwe, from the Los Angeles Myanmar Movement, which works with Myanmar activists in the United States. 


In a Zoom call with VOA, Shwe also criticized what he sees as the high administrative costs of aid distribution. 


“Because of the lack of state-to-state cooperation in a case such as Myanmar, where the aid is meant for humanitarian assistance, but not for the ruling power, this leads to several layers of management,” he said. 


“The aid is funneled through USAID partners, the biggest of which is the U.N., which has to operate under the rules of the junta. In many cases, the U.N. will in turn deal with [non-governmental organizations]. The NGO then needs to distribute that aid to [civil society organizations] on the ground. This leads to ever-increasing administrative costs and less actual assistance to those in need.” 


Shwe said administration costs eat up around 45% of aid funds. 


“Only $75 million of the $121 million is allocated for cross-border aid, which we believe will be more effective than channeling funds through the U.N., the largest partner of USAID," Shwe added. But he welcomed the lawmakers’ decision to specifically name the NUG and the NUCC in the act, ensuring that they will play a role in the allocation of the funds. 


Hopes for assistance amid U.S. engagement 


Hopes for continued humanitarian assistance to Myanmar are on the rise after U.S. State Department Counselor Derek Chollet and USAID Assistant Administrator Michael Schiffer met this month with representatives from the NUG. 


“The meeting underscores the ongoing commitment of the United States to engage with Myanmar's NUG leadership and support their endeavors to promote democracy, peace, and stability in the region,” said an April 11 State Department press release. 


Chollet also met in late March with ethnic armed organizations allied with the NUG.


"Met today with leaders of Burma’s ‘K3C’ ethnic group alliance on their extraordinary efforts to pursue a federal democracy in Burma,” he wrote on X on March 28. “We discussed steps for the international community to expand assistance to those in need and secure a better future for the people of Burma." 




The K3C alliance, comprising the Kachin Independence Organization, Karen National Union, Karenni National Progressive Party, and Chin National Front, is politically aligned with the NUG and collaborates militarily with its armed wing, the People’s Defense Force. 


"We briefed them on the political and military situation in our state, as well as the humanitarian situation,” said Aung San Myint, secretary of the Karenni National Progressive Party, who shared details of the meeting with VOA by phone.  


“Following our presentation, they assured us of continued collaboration as the U.S. Department of State. ... We have hope for increased humanitarian aid as discussions progress with U.S. officials."

## US sanctions four over 'malicious cyber activity' for Iran's military

date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. ramped up its sanctions against Iran on Tuesday, designating four people and two companies it says were "involved in malicious cyber activity" on behalf of the country's military.  


"These actors targeted more than a dozen U.S. companies and government entities through cyber operations, including spear phishing and malware attacks," the U..S Treasury Department said in a statement. 


The individuals and companies were working "on behalf of" Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Cyber Electronic Command (IRGC-CEC), the Treasury said. 


"Iranian malicious cyber actors continue to target U.S. companies and government entities in a coordinated, multi-pronged campaign intended to destabilize our critical infrastructure and cause harm to our citizens," the Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Brian Nelson, said in a statement. 


"The United States will continue to leverage our whole-of-government approach to expose and disrupt these networks' operations," he added.  


Tuesday's sanctions are the latest to be levied against Tehran by the United States and its allies for supporting anti-Israel proxies in the Middle East and for providing military support for Russia's war in Ukraine.  


Last week, the U..S and Britain announced widespread sanctions against Iran's military drone program in response to Tehran's large-scale attack against Israel earlier this month.  


That attack came in response to an April 1 airstrike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus — widely blamed on Israel — that killed seven members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including two generals. 


A day after those sanctions were unveiled, the U.S. fined a Thailand-based firm $20 million for more than 450 possible Iran sanctions violations. 


They included processing close to $300 million in wire transfers for a company jointly owned by the National Petroleum Company of Iran.  


Alongside Tuesday's sanctions, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have indicted the four individuals in question "for their roles in cyber activity targeting U.S. entities," the Treasury Department said.

## Fedora 40 released with KDE Plasma 6 and GNOME 46

date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News

It&#8217;s a big day for Fedora users such as myself &#8211; and especially for Fedora KDE users, also such as myself. Fedora 40 has been released today, and while the main focus is always on the GNOME release &#8211; although not everyone is happy about that &#8211; the various other spins, in Fedora parlance, have also seen major updates. Most prominently among them is the KDE spin, which ships with KDE&#8217;s recent megarelease, KDE Plasma 6. Starting at the top, Fedora 40 Workstation comes with the latest GNOME release, 46, which we covered when it was released earlier this year. It also comes with IPV4 Address Conflict Detection to resolve duplicate IPV4 addresses in the same physical network, and the PyTorch machine learning framework is now in the Fedora software repositories for easier installation and implementation by developers &#8211; a harbinger of what&#8217;s to come. The KDE spin comes, as already mentioned, with KDE Plasma 6, and inherits the non-GNOME improvements and fixes as well, of course. There&#8217;s also countless other spins covering pretty much every desktop environment and window manager under the sun, and Fedora 40 is also the first release to implement the new naming scheme for Fedora&#8217;s various immutable editions &#8211; the Atomic Desktops.

## US government agrees to $138.7M settlement over FBI's botching of Nassar assault allegations

date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA

DETROIT — The U.S. Justice Department announced a $138.7 million settlement Tuesday with more than 100 people who accused the FBI of grossly mishandling allegations of sexual assault against Larry Nassar in 2015 and 2016, a critical time gap that allowed the sports doctor to continue to prey on victims before his arrest. 


When combined with other settlements, roughly $1 billion now has been set aside by various organizations to compensate hundreds of women who said Nassar assaulted them under the guise of treatment for sports injuries. 


Nassar worked at Michigan State University and also served as a team doctor at Indianapolis-based USA Gymnastics. He's now serving decades in prison for assaulting female athletes, including medal-winning Olympic gymnasts. 


Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin Mizer said Nassar betrayed the trust of those in his care for decades, and that the "allegations should have been taken seriously from the outset." 


"While these settlements won't undo the harm Nassar inflicted, our hope is that they will help give the victims of his crimes some of the critical support they need to continue healing," Mizer said of the agreement to settle 139 claims. 


The Justice Department has acknowledged that it failed to step in. For more than a year, FBI agents in Indianapolis and Los Angeles had knowledge of allegations against him but apparently took no action, an internal investigation found. 


FBI Director Christopher Wray was contrite — and very blunt — when he spoke to survivors at a Senate hearing in 2021. The assault survivors include decorated Olympians Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney. 


"I'm sorry that so many different people let you down, over and over again," Wray said. "And I'm especially sorry that there were people at the FBI who had their own chance to stop this monster back in 2015 and failed." 


 




After a search, investigators said in 2016 that they had found images of child sex abuse and followed up with federal charges against Nassar. Separately, the Michigan attorney general's office handled the assault charges that ultimately shocked the sports world and led to an extraordinary dayslong sentencing hearing with gripping testimony about his crimes. 


"I'm deeply grateful. Accountability with the Justice Department has been a long time in coming," said Rachael Denhollander of Louisville, Kentucky, who is not part of the latest settlement but was the first person to publicly step forward and detail abuse at the hands of Nassar. 


"The unfortunate reality is that what we are seeing today is something that most survivors never see," Denhollander told The Associated Press. "Most survivors never see accountability. Most survivors never see justice. Most survivors never get restitution." 


Michigan State University, which was also accused of missing chances over many years to stop Nassar, agreed to pay $500 million to more than 300 women and girls who were assaulted. USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee made a $380 million settlement.

China will see incredible EV growth this year, with EVs accounting for about 45% of car sales. As EV prices continue to fall and supply chains improve, global demand will continue to rise. By 2035, “every other car sold globally is set to be electric” if today’s policies hold, the IEA said. “Rather than tapering off, the global EV revolution appears to be gearing up for a new phase of growth,” <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VVpFMT4dYV4CW2Ns1N5992KjsW1f4B6k5ddKMDN6L2ZqT5nXHsW5BWr2F6lZ3kLW3KVvZM4_S40lW45z8vX78_NBbW5X2l7v1v-yj8W95LGGw68v7QfW9bKykv635rvWW43Vf388bTy8YVkmX-S3x5XwcW8TY5_W69cbhVW10fbK74WkJkgT9Fnn2bgjzFW78vpRF6wjHZRW1_3CGL79zh8vW4LgBDx2lfQYfW8h8kVY6qcNBnW7dLHqY6ZnbHgW6LtdDF7nFRyHN2xHMzNgbvX9Mc0GG7dpZZGW2ZTkHd7Mw-3CW917MD720TjlFW8BH4jH5Y1hMzW59hDlZ34kQ9zW2Lqf3T836VR2W7sNkK01nt9RSW3WhTfr1DgWTXW2Y6Qt17rsWv_Vvq7PY5tym58W2pGVcz32TJq7Vhn6s693ZnjVN8F23fM3M-LqN4yywpWCYdHNW6K1z_s20FMLhVn5qHh1JYhytW7Jvb257rpVpjf29-qK-04" target="_blank">said</a> IEA executive director Fatih Birol. “This shift will have major ramifications for both the auto industry and the energy sector.” The report calls for growing charging networks to keep pace with EV sales.

The study, published in<em><em> Communications Earth & Environment</em></em>, found that human-caused climate change increased both the size and longevity of the 27-day heat dome, the former by about 34%, and the latter by 60%. About one-third of the area that burned was covered by the dome. The authors note that the heat wave would have been 150 times less likely to happen without climate change. “Climate change will continue to magnify heat dome events, increase fire danger, and enable extreme synchronous wildfire in forested areas of North America,” they wrote.

## NetBSD 9.4 released

date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News

Hot on the heels of NetBSD 10.0 comes NetBSD 9.4, a minor release in the previous release branch. NetBSD 9.4 is primarily a bug and security fix release, however, there are some new features, such as support for more MegaRAID controllers, ZTE MF112 and D-Link DWM222 USB 3G modems, and improved CPU feature detection for newer AMD/Intel devices. All users of netbsd-9 should upgrade if they are not following the stable branch. ↫ NetBSD 9.4 release announcement A very important note here is that the version of OpenSSL in NetBSD 9.4 is no longer supported unless you have a support contract with OpenSSL. They suggest upgrading to NetBSD 10.0, or to use OpenSSL from pkgsrc.

## Tribblix SPARC milestone 30 released

date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News

Tribblix, the unique ilumos distribution &#8211; think Solaris &#8211; has a new SPARC milestone. It&#8217;s one of the few platforms still actively supporting SPARC, so even if the amount of users might be slim, I think it&#8217;s an important contribution to the ecosystem. The application software here roughly corresponds to m34 on x86 systems, although the underlying illumos is still closer to m25/m26. Note that there are no functional illumos changes from the m28 sparc release &#8211; if that release didn&#8217;t work on your system, this one won&#8217;t either. ↫ Peter Tribble I&#8217;m still looking for my mythical, unobtanium Sun Ultra 45, a goal farther away now than it&#8217;s ever been (Patreon maybe? One-time donation? Help me out after I took OSNews full-time?), and the SPARC version of Tribblix would be my first go-to.

date: 2024-04-23, from: OS News

There is something about surprising interfaces: clapping to switch on lights is more fun than a flipping a switch. Pressing a panic-button to order a pizza is more fun than ordering via an app. Recently I came across this surprising interface: a flute controlled mouse cursor for a first person shooter. I recognize a good idea when I see one, and immediately wanted replicate the idea and make it freely available. So I got to work. ↫ Joren Six I don&#8217;t think I have ever seen something quite so unique.

## Columbia’s ongoing protests cause canceled classes and increased tensions

date: 2024-04-23, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Columbia University held virtual classes Monday on the sixth continuous day of student protests over the Israel-Hamas conflict.


University president Nemat “Minouche” Shafik sent an email to the Columbia community announcing that classes would be held virtually.


“The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days,” Shafik wrote. “These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas. We need a reset.”


More than 100 students were arrested at the school April 18, after the university’s president authorized police to clear away protesters. Some of the students also received suspension notices from the school.


Columbia’s action prompted an onslaught of pro-Palestinian demonstrations at other universities and responses from faculty and politicians.


The arrests occurred after students calling themselves Columbia University Apartheid Divest erected dozens of tents on a lawn at the center of the campus, establishing it as the "Gaza Solidarity Encampment."


Following the arrests and the demolition of the original encampment, another pro-Palestine encampment sprung on an adjacent lawn.


Students aren’t the only demonstrators experiencing tensions on campus and with the university administration.


Monday morning, Business School assistant professor Shai Davidai was denied entry to the university for an attempted pro-Israel counter-protest on the occupied lawn after he refused to comply with the university’s counter-protest policies.


“I am a professor here; I have every right to be everywhere on campus. You cannot let people who support Hamas on campus, and me, a professor, not on campus. Let me in now,” he said after Columbia COO Cass Halloway stopped him and other pro-Israel protesters at the entrance gates.


He has repeatedly called student protesters “violent maniacs” and “pro-Hamas terrorists.” A petition calling for Davidai’s dismissal has amassed nearly 9,000 signatures as of last Thursday night; additional grievances have been shared on social media and with the university.


Some Jewish students at Columbia say that many criticisms of Israel are antisemitic and make them feel unsafe.


Since the arrests, many student groups and Columbia affiliate groups have released statements condemning the university’s decision to arrest students, citing discriminatory enforcement of rules that limit students' freedom of speech.


Monday, hundreds of faculty members from across Columbia and Barnard staged a rally and walkout to urge the university to reverse the students’ suspensions. Some faculty members wore their graduation regalia and sashes reading “We support students.”


The backlash from the protests has even reached the ear of U.S. President Joe Biden. When asked about the recent events at the university by reporters Monday, Biden said, “I condemn the antisemitic protests. That’s why I have set up a program to deal with that. I also condemn those who don’t understand what’s going on with the Palestinians.”


Other campuses, such as Yale, Stanford, and New York University have also rallied around the Palestinian cause, calling for their universities to divest from companies with ties to Israel and for a ceasefire in Gaza. Many have put up tent encampments on their campuses. About 50 students were arrested at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, Monday after they refused to leave their encampment.


Student protesters at Columbia have urged organizers of rallies outside the campus to “remember what we are protesting for” and focus on the war in Gaza, rather than just expressing solidarity with protesters.


The university announced Tuesday morning that classes on the Morningside main campus, where the protests are taking place, will be offered in a hybrid format for the remainder of the Spring semester. The last day of classes is April 29. 


Some information for this report was provided by Reuters and the Associated Press.
