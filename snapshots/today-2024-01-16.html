<p>Friends, The mainstream media still don’t get it. This morning’s New York Times tried to describe it and utterly failed: “Donald J. Trump’s decisive victory in Iowa revealed a new depth to the reservoir of devotion inside his party. For eight years, he has nurtured a relationship with his supporters with little precedent in politics. He validates them, he entertains them, he speaks for them and he uses them for his political and legal advantage.</p>

<h2 id="us-military-seizes-iranian-missile-parts-bound-for-houthi-rebels-2-seals-still-missing">US Military Seizes Iranian Missile Parts Bound for Houthi Rebels; 2 SEALS Still Missing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JERUSALEM — U.S. Navy SEALS seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry from a ship bound for Yemen’s Houthi rebels in a raid last week that saw two of its commandos go missing, the U.S. military said Tuesday. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new ship came under suspected fire from the Houthis in the Red Sea and sustained some damage, though no one was wounded, officials said. </p>
<p>The raid marks the latest seizure by the U.S. Navy and its allies of weapon shipments bound for the rebels, who have launched a series of attacks now threatening global trade in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The seized missile components included types likely used in those attacks. </p>
<p>The attacks, U.S.-led retaliatory strikes and the raid all have raised tensions across the wider Middle East, which also saw Iran conduct ballistic missile strikes in both Iraq and Syria. </p>
<p>The SEAL raid happened last Thursday, with the commandos launching from the USS Lewis B. Puller backed by drones and helicopters, with the U.S. military’s Central Command saying it took place in the Arabian Sea. </p>
<p>The SEALs traveled in small special operations combat craft driven by naval special warfare crew to get to the boat. As they were boarding it in rough seas, around 8 p.m. local time, one SEAL got knocked off by high waves and a teammate went in after him. Both remain missing. </p>
<p>The SEALs found cruise and ballistic missile components, including propulsion and guidance devices, as well as warheads, Central Command said. It added that air defense parts also were found. </p>
<p>“Initial analysis indicates these same weapons have been employed by the Houthis to threaten and attack innocent mariners on international merchant ships transiting in the Red Sea,” Central Command said in a statement. </p>
<p>Images released by the U.S. military analyzed by The Associated Press showed components resembling rocket motors and others previously seized. It also included what appeared to be an anti-ship cruise missile with a small turbojet engine — a type used by the Houthis and Iran. </p>
<p>Also included in the photos was a warhead similarly seen in the Iranian anti-ship missiles which are based off an earlier Chinese design, said Fabian Hinz, a missile expert and research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. </p>
<p>“Looking at the size and the robustness of the thing, it looks a lot like an anti-ship warhead,” Hinz said. </p>
<p>Hinz also noted the warhead in the photo has a sticker reading “GHAD” on it. Iran has an anti-ship missile called the Ghadir. </p>
<p>The U.S. Navy ultimately sunk the ship carrying the weapons after deeming it unsafe, Central Command said. The ship’s 14 crew have been detained. </p>
<p>The Houthis have not acknowledged the seizure and Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>A United Nations resolution bans arms transfers to Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Tehran has long denied arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons back to Iran. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Tuesday, a missile struck the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia in the Red Sea. The vessel had been heading north to the Suez Canal when it was attacked, the Greek Shipping and Island Policy Ministry said. </p>
<p>The ship — managed by a Greek firm— had no cargo on board and sustained only material damage, the ministry said. The crew included 20 Ukrainians, three Filipinos and one Georgian. </p>
<p>Satellite-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed the Zografia still moving after the attack. </p>
<p>The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which monitors incidents in the Mideast’s waterways, earlier acknowledged an attack in the vicinity of the Zografia. </p>
<p>Since November, the Houthis have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade. </p>
<p>U.S.-led airstrikes targeted Houthi positions on Friday and Saturday. In response, the Houthis launched a missile at a U.S.-owned bulk carrier in the Gulf of Aden, further raising the risks in the conflict.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-players-face">Challenges players face</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Challenges players face
</h1>
<p>
I’m running Arden Vul as an open table. Sessions are generally less than 2h long. There are maybe a dozen players, maybe half of them regulars. Arden Vul is a megadungeon. The PDF has about 1200 pages. There are many entrances, many levels, many factions, and so on. As it is a megadungeon, players can choose for themselves what difficulty level they want to go for. Conversely, if there’s a new player with a level 1 character, they can all agree to stick to lower level characters in order to make an adventure party that promises an entertaining evening for all.
</p>
<p>
Recently, I’ve started noticing that the setup introduces some player challenges that I hadn’t thought of.
</p>
<p>
If the party is powerful and the opposition is strong but clearly less powerful, then frontal assaults “work” but at the same time the session only lasts for a certain number of hours and endless fighting killing many dozens of goblins, skeletons or cultists turns out to be somewhat boring and sap away time. Even if the characters aren’t hurt, time is lost.
</p>
<p>
This is a challenge that attacks player entertainment somewhat like character death or long character creation, I feel.
</p>
<p>
You know how regular combat in the game attacks the player characters. Some elements of it also attack player resources. This is mostly related to character death. The result forces the player to do things they dislike: start with a new character that has fewer levels, fewer connections, less money, or incurs some other loss. Furthermore, if character creation takes a very long time, then the player has to spend the time thinking up a new build, a new concept.
</p>
<p>
In a way, an opposition that acts like a morass, wasting time unless the players find another way to circumvent the problem, is a similar attack upon the enjoyment of players. No amount of attack bonuses and initiatives won helps against waves of undead if you can’t turn them or hold them off some other way.
</p>
<p>
But there is more!
</p>
<p>
Since the megadungeon has a lot of doors and secrets that need keys, and artefacts that are required for certain goals or quests, it’s important to note who has what, and where it was found. I don’t want there to be a virtual pool of plot items in a bag of holding that is always with the group currently adventuring because even though everybody likes it now I dread the first total party kill where I announce that all the plot items are now lost. That’ll be the end of the campaign for sure.
</p>
<p>
I confess that I also hope on some level that knowing who has what plot-relevant item increases interactivity as people start to realize that for this or that to happen, they need to contact the player of the character who’s the owner of a particular item.
</p>
<p>
But yes, if players stop showing up, their characters don’t show up and the items they have, both magic items they found and plot items they hold, effectively disappear from the game.
</p>
<p>
So this is an additional player challenge of their organisational skills. Can they keep track of the items? Can they organise hand-overs?
</p>
<p>
Arden Vul is also a megadungeon where hints can be found in the hundreds of rumours, wall scribbles, frescos, mosaics, and so on. But if nobody collects and studies them, the information is effectively lost. If one player keeps notes on paper, or in their Google Docs, that information is effectively lost to the others.
</p>
<p>
I know that as a player in the Barrowmaze I’m also not a great organiser of rumours heard and information gathered. There is space for improvement!
</p>
<p>
So this is another player challenge: how to best share information. Can they build a knowledge repository somewhere, that helps them distribute information and collect hypothesises and conclusions?
</p>
<p>
The same is true about the ruins explored, entrances found, and perhaps more importantly, the places where no entrances were found but also they left before making absolutely sure. In a few sessions, players don’t remember where they’ve been and they don’t remember whether an area was fully explored. This duplicates effort and lost opportunities.
</p>
<p>
All in all, this is a sort of price to pay for the freedom players have in this kind of setup.
</p>

So if you have an account on <a href="https://feedland.org/">feedland.org</a>, the original system, which is still running of course, you could now reasonably move to feedland.com. To do so, just export your OPML subscription list from .org, create a new account on .com, and import the subscription list. It might take a while for all the new feeds to be fully updated, but you’ll be rewarded by a higher performance user experience. Thanks to <a href="https://ma.tt/">Matt</a> and company for giving us access to this phenomenal resource. I still haven’t gotten used to designing with the assumption that my system can scale as far as it seems it can.</p>

<li>Trump’s Iowa speeches offer preview of 2024 climate attack lines
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>Former President Donald Trump handily won the Republican Iowa caucus on Monday night, and his speeches at the event were sprinkled with anti-climate lines we’re likely to hear more of in his 2024 presidential campaign, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e5e7af162d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes <em>Heatmap</em>’s Jeva Lange</a>. In his victory speech, Trump made a jab about electric vehicle range anxiety, and promised to do more “drilling” if he gets the White House back. Earlier in the evening he told would-be voters that “I stood up for ethanol like nobody has ever stood up for it” – a dig at Biden’s climate agenda, which has aimed to limit liquid fuel in vehicles, a sensitive issue for Iowa voters during their primary season. On Sunday a group of young climate protesters disrupted one of Trump’s rallies, calling him a “climate criminal.” Trump told them to “go home to mommy.”<br/><br/>This was the coldest caucus in Iowa’s history thanks to a weather system that dragged temperatures below freezing for most of the country. As Lange notes: “Scientists say the arctic blast is exactly the kind of extreme event we can expect more of in a climate-changed world.”

<strong></strong>Oil and gas giant Shell is facing its “most significant shareholder push on climate policy,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6f00ed55f7&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a> the <em>Financial Times</em>. A group of 27 investors – including Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi – are backing an independent resolution filed by activist group Follow This demanding the company do more to slash its greenhouse gas emissions. The resolution calls on Shell to better align its pollution targets with the Paris Agreement and focuses specifically on the emissions customers generate when they use Shell’s products, known as Scope 3 emissions. The company called the resolution “unrealistic and simplistic” and insisted its targets already align with the Paris Agreement. This isn’t Follow This’ first resolution aimed at Shell, but this one appears to have the most momentum: Its investor-backers own about 5% of Shell’s shares. Support for the resolution is expected to grow ahead of a vote at the company’s annual general meeting in May, <em>The Guardian</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0ad195a748&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.

<strong></strong>A growing number of company executives across the globe are worried their firms won’t survive the next 10 years unless they undergo a major overhaul, according to a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9de4937279&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">survey</a> of 4,700 CEOs conducted by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). About 45% of the respondents are concerned about their current business models, up from 39% on last year’s survey. Among their top anxieties are artificial intelligence and – you guessed it – climate change. Nearly one-third of CEOs say they expect climate change to “alter the way they create, deliver, and capture value over the next three years.” About two-thirds of respondents say their firms are improving their energy efficiency, but support is lacking for other climate-related company initiatives:

<h2 id="trumps-climate-sneak-peek-in-iowa">Trump’s Climate Sneak Peek in Iowa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTA3NDkyNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNjAzNTk5OX0.rMR4KOIdgC4cSYZFW5I78WdqMw4rx0A3mTBVncqI7fA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
On Monday night, former PresidentDonald Trump handily won what will officially go down as <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSDesMoines/status/1747007758237622438" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="" target="_blank">the coldest caucus</a> in Iowa’s history.
</p>
<p>
The global warming jokes, naturally, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-host-suggests-cold-iowa-temps-ruining-climate-protesters-pleas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote themselves</a>. But in his freewheeling, name-dropping, teleprompter-free victory speech in Des Moines, Trump showed uncharacteristic restraint in avoiding the low-hanging comedic fruit.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it was because Trump’s mind was on other things: his civil damages trial that begins in New York City <a href="https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1747072511718613247?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on Tuesday</a>, say. Or maybe, as I suspect, it was part of a larger trend that has come to shape Trump’s third presidential campaign — that he’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">honing his attacks on climate science and the energy transition</a> for <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self">the 2024 race</a>.
</p>
<p>
Certainly, Trump’s Iowa speech featured some of his favorite one-liners from the campaign trail. “He comes all the way from Missouri, which isn’t that far,” Trump said at one point in an apparent reference to Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, one of numerous surrogates who’d helped with a ground game Trump <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/08/2024/donald-trump-isnt-winning-iowa-the-usual-way" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">hadn’t seemed terribly interested in</a> trying himself. “Couldn’t drive an electric car that far, though,” Trump added to laughs — a variation of a jab about range anxiety that he’s been trotting out at his rallies. (Des Moines to the Missouri border is 76 miles, which even <a href="https://www.topspeed.com/electric-cars-with-lowest-range/#mazda-mx-30-100-miles" target="_blank">the least efficient EVs</a> could make without stopping; <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">most new EVs on the market</a> could also make it to the capital, Jefferson City — 255 miles away — on a single charge).
</p>
<p>
Trump also made enthusiastic references to “drilling,” promising we’ll do a whole lot of it if he gets the White House back. “We have to stop the invasion, we have to bring down the energy — you know, I say all the time, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation anywhere in the world — and we have to stop the crime and we have to help rebuild our cities,” Trump went on, distracted from <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">his usual script</a>, which typically involves an additional story about President Biden “begging” Venezuela for oil.
</p>
<p>
Trump had also spoken in specifics earlier in the evening when he’d told would-be voters that “I stood up for ethanol like nobody has ever stood up for it” — another dig at Biden’s climate agenda, which has aimed to <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change-wind-solar-electric-vehicles-energy" target="_self">limit liquid fuel in vehicles</a>, a <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/editorials/2022/02/13/iowa-ethanol-economy-lawmakers-ignore-warning-signs-biofuels/6701662001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sensitive issue for Iowa voters</a> during their primary season.
</p>
<p>
But if Americans could agree on anything this week, it’s that it’s cold. Between the Iowa caucuses and Tuesday night, more than three-quarters of the country will experience <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/14/weather/south-snow-storm-ice-forecast-climate/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">temperatures below freezing</a> — weather that will shatter over 200 winter temperature records, all told. And while that might lend itself to <a href="https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1746673199989874833?s=20" target="_blank">unoriginal jokes</a> among conservatives, scientists say the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whats-behind-the-arctic-blast-plunging-into-the-u-s/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">arctic blast</a> is exactly the kind of extreme event we can expect more of in a climate-changed world.
</p>
<p>
On Sunday, Trump mocked any alarm that might instill in people — <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">including his own supporters</a> — by telling a group of climate protesters that interrupted his rally to “go home to mommy. Your mommy’s waiting.”
</p>
<p>
But <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/climate-change-where-is-safe" style="" target="_self">nowhere is safe</a>, and there are a long 11 months and three seasons to go before the next election. Still, some things can grimly be assumed to be forgone: Trump will almost certainly be the Republican candidate. And whatever comes next, it will be worse.

<h2 id="most-iowa-republican-caucus-goers-say-trump-fit-to-be-president-if-convicted">Most Iowa Republican Caucus-goers Say Trump Fit to be President if Convicted</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Most Republicans at Iowa’s caucus said they felt Donald Trump would be fit for the White House even if he were convicted of a crime, an entrance poll showed on Monday, underscoring the stronghold the former president has on the Republican Party.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of caucus-goers also said they did not believe Democratic President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, according to the poll.</p>
<p>Following are highlights from the Edison Research poll based on interviews with 1,628 Iowa Republicans.</p>
<pre><code>66% said they did not think Biden legitimately won the presidency in 2020.
65% said they decided who to support in the presidential nomination contest before this month.
65% said Trump would still be fit to be president if he were convicted of a crime. 31% said he would be unfit if convicted.
61% said they favor a federal law that would ban abortions nationwide.
53% of white caucus-goers who considered themselves evangelical or born-again Christians supported Trump, while 27% backed DeSantis.
46% of voters said they considered themselves part of the MAGA movement, a reference to Trump&#39;s Make America Great Again slogan. 50% said they were not part of that movement.
Trump led Haley and DeSantis by double digits among men and women alike. But among college graduates Trump was preferred by about 37% of caucus-goers, compared to 28% for Haley and 26% for DeSantis.
38% percent of caucus-goers said the economy was the issue that mattered most in deciding who to vote for on Monday, compared to 34% who cited immigration, while the rest cited foreign policy or abortion.
14% said the most important quality a Republican presidential nominee should have is the ability to beat Biden, compared to 41% who said shared values mattered most.</code></pre>
<p>Edison Research conducted the poll on behalf of the National Election Pool, a consortium of news organizations including Reuters.</p>

<h2 id="us-naurus-decision-to-break-with-taiwan-disappointing">US: Nauru’s Decision to Break with Taiwan ‘Disappointing’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States said Monday that the government of Nauru’s severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan is “disappointing,” despite it being a sovereign decision.</p>
<p>The Pacific Island nation announced its decision to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China shortly after Taiwan’s presidential and legislative elections.</p>
<p>“Taiwan is a reliable, like-minded, and democratic partner. The PRC often makes promises in exchange for diplomatic relations that ultimately remain unfulfilled,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a statement late Monday.  He was referring to People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Miller added: “We encourage all countries to expand engagement with Taiwan and to continue to support democracy, good governance, transparency, and adherence to the rule of law.”</p>
<p>The Republic of Nauru “will no longer recognize the Republic of China (Taiwan) as a separate country but rather as an inalienable part of China’s territory,” said the Nauru government in an official statement on Monday.  </p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials praised the move.</p>
<p>“China appreciates and welcomes the decision of the government of the Republic of Nauru,” said Mao Ning who is a spokesperson of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>“The Nauru government’s decision of reestablishing diplomatic ties with China once again shows that the one-China principle is where global opinion trends” are, said Mao.  </p>
<p>She repeated China’s assertion that “Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory” during a briefing Monday.</p>
<p>Implications to the U.S. policy towards the Pacific Islands</p>
<p>Nauru is one of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum, or PIF, the premier political and economic policy-making body for the region. It comprises 18 member states, with Australia and New Zealand being the largest economies in the bloc. Neither the United States nor China is a full member.</p>
<p>Last September, U.S. President Joe Biden hosted leaders from this Pacific Islands bloc at a two-day summit in Washington, amid rising U.S. concerns about China’s growing military and economic influence in the region.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The shift in Nauru’s position means the next Pacific Islands Forum secretary general will be from a country that recognizes the government in Beijing, rather than the government in Taipei.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe Nauru’s move could make it more challenging for the PIF to resist overtures from China.</p>
<p>Last November, former Nauru President Baron Waqa was selected as the next PIF Secretary General, at a time when Nauru still maintained diplomatic ties with Taiwan. Waqa has reportedly resisted China’s pressure in the past. It remains to be seen whether he will continue as the PIF Secretary General.</p>
<p>According to Cleo Paskal, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, or FDD, Chinese offers to Nauru have been present for years, and the specifics of this deal were likely finalized before the Taiwan elections.</p>
<p>She suggested that Beijing might have delayed the announcement until after the Taiwan elections to “reinforce” the PRC’s narrative.</p>
<p>“U.S. policy in the Pacific Islands is not shining at the moment,” Paskal told VOA.</p>
<p>“Nauru has been asking for help with things like developing its port and protecting its waters for years - things that would help regional security as well.  The longer they wait, the more room for PRC operatives to say ‘they aren’t coming, you should cut the deal in front of you now, with us’.  The window for U.S. relevance is closing.”</p>
<p>UN resolution 2758</p>
<p>Monday, the State Department said the United States will continue to support Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the international community and deepen economic ties, consistent with Washington’s longstanding One China policy.</p>
<p>The U.S. does not take a position on Taiwan’s sovereignty. Under Washington’s One China policy, the U.S. acknowledges Beijing’s claims of sovereignty over Taiwan but does not endorse them.</p>
<p>Washington and Taipei have held regular consultations to explore Taiwan’s participation in the United Nations system and other international forums, to address a range of global challenges, including public health, aviation safety and climate change.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese spokesperson Mao Ning said, “There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory,” citing United Nations resolution 2758. </p>
<p>On October 25, 1971, the U.N. General Assembly passed U.N. Resolution 2758, which replaced the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan’s formal name) with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as a permanent member of the Security Council in the United Nations.</p>
<p>While the resolution stated the representatives of the PRC government were the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, it neither determined Taiwan’s status nor said Taiwan was part of China.</p>
<p>The PRC’s efforts to rewrite Taiwan’s status at the United Nations intensified during the 1990s and early 2000s, coinciding with the island’s democratization, according to an analysis by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</p>

<h2 id="succession-dominates-drama-emmys-the-bear-claims-comedy-brunson-makes-history">‘Succession’ Dominates Drama Emmys, ‘The Bear’ Claims Comedy, Brunson Makes History</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — “Succession” secured its legacy with its third best drama series award, “The Bear” feasted as the night’s top comedy, and the two shows about squabbling families dominated the acting awards at Monday night’s Emmys.</p>
<p>Historic wins also came for Quinta Brunson of “Abbot Elementary” and Steven Yeun and Ali Wong of “Beef” at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day ceremony that was finally held four months late after a turbulent year of strikes in Hollywood.</p>
<p>“Succession,” the HBO saga of the dysfunctional generations of a maladjusted media empire, won the top prize for its fourth and final season. It also won best actress in a drama for Sarah Snook and best actor in a drama for Kieran Culkin.</p>
<p>“We all put our all into it and the bar was set so high,” Snook said.</p>
<p>“The Bear,” the FX dramedy about a contentious family and a struggling restaurant at the center of the life of a talented chef, won best comedy series for its first season. It also made a meal of its acting categories, with Jeremy Allen White winning best actor in a comedy, best supporting actress in a comedy for Ayo Edebiri winning best supporting actress, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach taking best supporting actor. All three were first-time nominees.</p>
<p>“This is a show about family and found family and real family,” Edebiri said from the stage as she accepted the first trophy of the night at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Instead of the usual producer speeches, Matty Matheson, a real-life elite chef who plays a kitchen newbie and repairman on “The Bear,” spoke for the show near the end of the Fox telecast.</p>
<p>“I just love restaurants so much, the good and the bad, we’re broken inside,” Matheson said before getting a long kiss on the mouth from Moss-Bachrach.</p>
<p>Brunson won best actress in a comedy for the show she created, ABC’s “Abbott Elementary,” becoming the first Black woman to win the award in more than 40 years and the first from a network show to win it in more than a decade.</p>
<p>“I am so happy to be able to live my dream and act out comedy,” Brunson said during her acceptance on the Fox telecast, fighting back tears. The writer-actor was among the stars with standout looks on the Emmys’ silver carpet.</p>
<p>“Succession” won six Emmys overall including best supporting actor in a drama for Matthew Macfadyen and best writing in a drama for show creator Jesse Armstrong. The only drama acting category it didn’t win was supporting actress, taken for the second time by Jennifer Coolidge of “The White Lotus.”</p>
<p>“The Bear” won in every category it was nominated for Monday night, and along with the four it had won previously at the Creative Arts Emmys, took 10 overall, the most of any show.</p>
<p>Landmark wins on TV’s big night</p>
<p>“Beef” won best limited series, while Steven Yeun and Ali Wong became the first Asian Americans to win in their categories – Yeun for best actor in a limited series and Wong for best actress. Creator Lee Sung won Emmys for writing and directing. It had eight Emmys overall after three wins at last weekend’s Creative Arts Emmy Awards.</p>
<p>Brunson had won a writing Emmy for “Abbott Elementary,” her mockumentary about a predominantly Black and chronically underfunded grade school in Philadelphia, but this is her first for acting. Isabel Sanford of “The Jeffersons” was the only previous Black woman to win the category in 1981.</p>
<p>The first hour of the show held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day saw three Black women win major awards: Brunson, Edebiri and Niecy Nash-Betts, who won best supporting actress in a limited series for “Dahmer – Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.”</p>
<p>On the Netflix show, Nash-Betts played a neighbor of the serial killer whose complaints to authorities about his behavior go unheeded.</p>
<p>“I accept this award on behalf of every Black and brown woman who has gone unheard and over-policed,” she said.</p>
<p>“Everybody having fun at the chocolate Emmys tonight?” host Anthony Anderson said during the show. “We are killing it tonight! … This is like MLK Day and Juneteenth all rolled up in one!”</p>
<p>The tweaked awards calendar made for some oddities. Edebiri and White won their Emmy for the show’s first season eight days after after winning Golden Globes for the second season.</p>
<p>Baby talk amid ‘succession’ wins</p>
<p>Culkin outshined the older brother and the father to win the final lead actor Emmy for “Succession.”</p>
<p>He had twice been nominated for best supporting actor for “Succession” without a win. But in the final season, in which his character Roman Roy goes from sideline wisecracker to emotional disaster at the center of the show’s drama, he was put in the lead category and won over castmates Brian Cox, who played his father, and Jeremy Strong, who played his older brother.</p>
<p>He then shifted to his own family, getting big laughs during his speech when he told his wife Jazz Charton that their two young kids weren’t enough. “I want more,” he said. “You said if I won, we could talk about it.”</p>
<p>Snook took her first Emmy in three nominations for “Succession” and her fictional husband Macfadyen won the second Emmy of his career for playing Tom Wambsgans, the son-in-law that began the HBO series as a hanger-on and ended it as the closest thing it had to a victor on “Succession.”</p>
<p>Many tears, and one concerned mother</p>
<p>Emotions ran high from the start of the ceremony. Edebiri and Brunson were both quick to cry as they took the stage, and the first presenter, Christina Applegate, who said in 2021 that she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, got a standing ovation as she came out using a cane, helped by Anderson. She struggled to get through the nominees and winner with the tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Anderson told the nominees at the beginning of the night that instead of having their speeches cut off by music, his mother, actor Doris Hancox, sitting in the audience, would tell them when it was time to move on. But she more often shouted down her son in the running gag.</p>
<p>Older shows return to spotlight</p>
<p>Honoring TV history was the theme at the 75th Emmys. Anderson opened the show on a “Mr. Rogers” set and performed TV theme songs including “Good Times,” and several cast reunions were spread throughout the show.</p>
<p>Cast members including Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell from “Martin,” Ted Danson and Rhea Perlman from “Cheers,” and Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers from “All in The Family,” performed short bits from recreations of their sitcom sets before presenting awards.</p>
<p>Tina Fey and Amy Poehler reunited to present an award in the form of their 2001-2005 “Weekend Update” team-up from “Saturday Night Live.”</p>
<p>“We’ve reached the stage in life where we’ll only present awards sitting down,” Fey said.</p>
<p>One notable appearance came from Katherine Heigl, who joined Ellen Pompeo and other former “Grey’s Anatomy” cast mates on a hospital room set after leaving the show, now about to start its 20th season, on not the best terms in 2010.</p>
<p>“Yes, there have been changes over the years,” Heigl said with a wry smile, “But the one constant is the amazing fanbase.”</p>

<h2 id="i-used-netscape-composer-in-2024">I used Netscape Composer in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>Netscape Composer was my first introduction to web development. As a kid, I created my first web pages using it. Those pages never made it online, but I proudly carried them around on a floppy disk to show them off on family members’ and friends’ computers. This is likely how I got the understanding that websites are just made of files. Using Netscape Composer also taught me basic web vocabulary, such as “page” and “hyperlink”. Of course, the web landscape has evolved immensely since then. I was curious to try out that dated software again and see what its limitations were, and what the code it produces looks like from a 2024 perspective. The first thing I needed was a goal. I decided to try and reproduce the home page of my personal website as closely as the application allowed it. That seemed like a sensible aim as my website has a rather minimalistic design, with very little that should be completely out of reach for an antiquated tool. ↫ Pier-Luc Brault What a fun exercise.</p>

<h2 id="menendezs-wife-asks-for-separate-trial-from-husband">Menendez’s Wife Asks for Separate Trial From Husband</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The wife of U.S. Senator Bob Menendez on Monday sought to sever the government’s corruption case against her from that of her husband, according to a court document. </p>
<p>In the document, Nadine Menendez’s lawyers said a joint trial would prejudice her right to defend herself at a fair trial. They added that a joint trial would force the married defendants to make a Hobson’s choice “as exercising their right to testify in their own defense may necessitate waiving their privilege against providing testimony adverse to their spouse.” </p>
<p>“Ms. Menendez’s interests in both maintaining the confidentiality of her privileged marital communications and exercising her spousal testimonial privilege without sacrificing her ability to testify in her own defense collectively support a finding of a ‘serious risk’ that a joint trial will compromise her ‘specific trial rights,’” the lawyers said. </p>
<p>The pair pleaded not guilty in October after they were charged with taking bribes from three New Jersey businessmen. </p>
<p>In charging the senator last September, prosecutors said investigators had found gold bars and envelopes stuffed with cash inside jackets in the New Jersey Democrat’s apartment. </p>
<p>They also said businessman Wael Hana had arranged meetings between Menendez and Egyptian officials, who pressed the senator to sign off on military aid. </p>
<p>In return, Hana put Menendez’s wife on the payroll of a company he controlled, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, prosecutors accused Menendez of helping a New Jersey businessman seek an investment from a Qatari company with ties to the Middle Eastern country’s government. </p>
<p>The latest allegations, which accused him of acting as a foreign agent, add pressure on the embattled senator, who has resisted calls to resign from members of his own party.</p>

<h2 id="austin-released-from-hospital-after-complications-from-prostate-cancer-surgery-he-kept-secret">Austin Released From Hospital After Complications From Prostate Cancer Surgery He Kept Secret</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was released from the hospital on Monday, after spending two weeks there to treat complications from surgery for prostate cancer he kept secret from senior Biden administration leaders and staff for weeks.</p>
<p>Austin will work from home as he recovers, and his doctors said he “progressed well throughout his stay and his strength is rebounding.” They said in a statement the cancer was treated early and his prognosis is “excellent.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Austin expressed thanks to the medical staff and said that “as I continue to recuperate and perform my duties from home, I’m eager to fully recover and return as quickly as possible to the Pentagon.”</p>
<p>Austin, 70, was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on December 22 and underwent surgery to treat the cancer, which was detected earlier in the month during a routine screening. He developed an infection a week later and was hospitalized Jan. 1 and admitted to intensive care.</p>
<p>Dr. John Maddox, the trauma medical director, and Dr. Gregory Chesnut, the director of the Center for Prostate Disease Research at Walter Reed, said that during Austin’s hospitalization he underwent medical tests and was treated for lingering leg pain. They said he has physical therapy to do but there are no plans for further cancer treatment other than regular checks.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and senior administration officials were not told about Austin’s hospitalization until January 4, and Austin kept the cancer diagnosis secret until January 9. Biden has said Austin’s failure to tell him about the hospitalization was a lapse in judgment, but the Democratic president insists he still has confidence in his Pentagon chief.</p>
<p>During Austin’s time at Walter Reed, the U.S. launched a series of military strikes late last week on the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, targeting dozens of locations linked to their campaign of assaults on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Working from his hospital bed, Austin juggled calls with senior military leaders, including General Erik Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, and White House meetings to review, order and ultimately watch the strikes unfold over secure video.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency about Austin’s hospitalization, however, has triggered administration and Defense Department reviews on the procedures for notifying the White House and others if a Cabinet member must transfer decision-making authorities to a deputy, as Austin did during his initial surgery and a portion of his latest hospital stay. And the White House chief of staff ordered Cabinet members to notify his office if they ever can’t perform their duties.</p>
<p>Austin’s secrecy also drew criticism from Congress members on both sides of the political aisle, and Representative Mike Rogers, an Alabama Republican who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said he has opened a formal inquiry into the matter.

<p>It is still unclear when Austin will return to his office in the Pentagon or how his cancer treatment will affect his job, travel and other public engagements going forward. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks has been taking on some of his day-to-day duties as he recovers.</p>

<h2 id="ships-aircraft-search-for-missing-navy-seals-after-mission-to-seize-iranian-missile-parts">Ships, Aircraft Search for Missing Navy Seals After Mission to Seize Iranian Missile Parts</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Navy SEALs seized Iranian-made missile parts and other weaponry from a ship bound for Yemen’s Houthi rebels in a raid last week that saw two of its commandos go missing, the U.S. military said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new ship came under suspected fire from the Houthis in the Red Sea and sustained some damage, though no one was wounded, officials said.</p>
<p>The raid marks the latest seizure by the U.S. Navy and its allies of weapon shipments bound for the rebels, who have launched a series of attacks now threatening global trade in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The seized missile components included types likely used in those attacks.</p>
<p>The attacks, U.S.-led retaliatory strikes and the raid all have raised tensions across the wider Middle East, which also saw Iran conduct ballistic missile strikes in both Iraq and Syria.</p>
<p>The SEAL raid happened last Thursday, with the commandos launching from the USS Lewis B. Puller backed by drones and helicopters, with the U.S. military’s Central Command saying it took place in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>The SEALs found cruise and ballistic missile components, including propulsion and guidance devices, as well as warheads, Central Command said. It added that air defense parts also were found.</p>
<p>“Initial analysis indicates these same weapons have been employed by the Houthis to threaten and attack innocent mariners on international merchant ships transiting in the Red Sea,” Central Command said in a statement.</p>
<p>Images released by the U.S. military analyzed by The Associated Press showed components resembling rocket motors and others previously seized. It also included what appeared to be a cruise missile with a small turbojet engine — a type used by the Houthis and Iran.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy ultimately sunk the ship carrying the weapons after deeming it unsafe, Central Command said. The ship’s 14 crew have been detained.</p>
<p>The Houthis have not acknowledged the seizure and Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>A United Nations resolution bans arms transfers to Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. Tehran has long denied arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons back to Iran.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tuesday, a missile struck the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia in the Red Sea. The vessel had been heading north to the Suez Canal when it was attacked, the Greek Shipping and Island Policy Ministry said.</p>
<p>The ship — managed by a Greek firm— had no cargo on board and sustained only material damage, the ministry said. The crew included 20 Ukrainians, three Filipinos and one Georgian.</p>
<p>Satellite-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed the Zografia still moving after the attack.</p>
<p>The British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which monitors incidents in the Mideast’s waterways, earlier acknowledged an attack in the vicinity of the Zografia.</p>
<p>Since November, the Houthis have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade.</p>
<p>U.S.-led airstrikes targeted Houthi positions on Friday and Saturday. In response, the Houthis launched a missile at a U.S.-owned bulk carrier in the Gulf of Aden, further raising the risks in the conflict.</p>
<p>The SEALs traveled in small special operations combat craft driven by naval special warfare crew to get to the boat. As they were boarding it in rough seas, around 8 p.m. local time, one SEAL got knocked off by high waves and a teammate went in after him. Both remain missing.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-no-longer-bringing-the-full-chrome-browser-to-fuchsia">Google is no longer bringing the full Chrome browser to Fuchsia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>In contrast to that minimal experience, Google was seemingly working to bring the full might of Chrome to Fuchsia. To observers, this was yet another signal that Google intended for Fuchsia to grow beyond the smart home and serve as a full desktop operating system. After all, what good is a laptop or desktop without a web browser? Fans of the Fuchsia project have anticipated its eventual expansion to desktop since Fuchsia was first shown to run on Google’s Pixelbook hardware. However, in the intervening time – a period that also saw significant layoffs in the Fuchsia division – it seems that Google has since shifted Fuchsia in a different direction. The clearest evidence of that move comes from a Chromium code change (and related bug tracker post) published last month declaring that the “Chrome browser on fuchsia won’t be maintained.” ↫ Kyle Bradshaw at 9To5Google Up until a few years ago, every indication was that Google had big plans for Fuchsia, from “workstation” builds to porting Chrome to developers using Fuchsia for Google Meet calls, and lots of other improvements, changes, and additions that pointed squarely at Fuchsia being prepped for use on more than just the Nest Hub devices. We’re about a year later now, and everything has changed. The workstation builds have been discontinued, the Fuchsia team was hit harder by the Google layoffs than other teams, and now the Chrome port has been deprecated. All signs now point to Fuchsia being effectively a dead end beyond its use on Hub devices. At least Google had the decency to kill this before it released it.</p>

<h2 id="effortless-openbsd-audio-and-desktop-screen-recording-guide">Effortless OpenBSD audio and desktop screen recording guide</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>Welcome to my comprehensive guide on recording audio and desktop screen on OpenBSD. In this blog post, I’m excited to share my personal setup and approach to efficiently capturing high-quality audio and video on one of the most secure and stable operating systems available. Whether you’re a professional content creator, a developer looking to record tutorials, or simply an OpenBSD enthusiast, this guide is tailored to help you navigate the intricacies of screen recording in this unique environment. Alongside this step-by-step tutorial, I’ve also included a practical YouTube video to demonstrate the quality and effectiveness of the recordings you can achieve with this setup. So, let’s dive in and explore the world of audio and video recording on OpenBSD! ↫ Rafael Sadowski The BSD world needs more of these kinds of guides and articles. I feel like the various BSDs have so much to offer to desktop users, especially now that there is a reasonable contingent of Linux users who aren’t happy with the spread of things like systemd and Wayland, but the fact of the matter is that the BSDs are not as focused on desktop and laptop use as Linux has been. That’s not a dig at BSD developers – BSD focuses on different things – but it does mean that people interested in using BSD on desktops and laptops need a bit more assistance.</p>

The results of our poll asking how frequently you use widgets show that roughly 50% of users never use widgets at all, with 25% to 50% of people using them slightly or heavily. But those numbers are complicated by the availability of three types of widgets on the iPhone and iPad, two on the Mac, and one on the Apple Watch.

<p>JERUSALEM — Houthi rebels fired a missile, striking a U.S.-owned ship Monday just off the coast of Yemen in the Gulf of Aden, less than a day after they launched an anti-ship cruise missile toward an American destroyer in the Red Sea. </p>
<p>The attack on the Gibraltar Eagle, later claimed by the Houthis, further escalates tensions gripping the Red Sea after American-led strikes on the rebels. The Houthis’ attacks have roiled global shipping, amid Israel’s war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip, targeting a crucial corridor linking Asian and Mideast energy and cargo shipments to the Suez Canal onward to Europe. </p>
<p>The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations, which oversees Mideast waters, said Monday’s attack happened some 110 miles (177 kilometers) miles southeast of Aden. It said the ship’s captain reported that the “port side of vessel hit from above by a missile.” </p>
<p>Private security firms Ambrey and Dryad Global told The Associated Press that the vessel was the Gibraltar Eagle, a Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier. The U.S. military’s Central Command later acknowledged the strike. </p>
<p>“The ship has reported no injuries or significant damage and is continuing its journey,” Central Command said. </p>
<p>Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed the attack in a recorded television address that aired Monday night. </p>
<p>“The Yemeni armed forces consider all American and British ships and warships participating in the aggression against our country as hostile targets,” he said. </p>
<p>The vessel is owned by Eagle Bulk Shipping, a Stamford, Connecticut-based firm traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In a statement to the AP, the company acknowledged the strike and said it caused “limited damage to a cargo hold but (the ship) is stable and is heading out of the area.” </p>
<p>“All seafarers onboard the vessel are confirmed to be uninjured,” the firm said. “The vessel is carrying a cargo of steel products. Eagle Bulk management is in close contact with all relevant authorities concerning this matter.” </p>
<p>Satellite-tracking data analyzed by the AP showed the Gibraltar Eagle had been bound for the Suez Canal, but rapidly turned around at the time of the attack. </p>
<p>Central Command said it detected a separate anti-ship ballistic missile launch toward the southern Red Sea on Monday, though it “failed in flight and impacted on land in Yemen.” </p>
<p>The U.S. Maritime Administration, under the Transportation Department, also issued a warning Monday saying there continues to be “a high degree of risk to commercial vessels” traveling near Yemen. </p>
<p>“While the decision to transit remains at the discretion of individual vessels and companies, it is recommended that U.S. flag and U.S.-owned commercial vessels” stay away from Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden “until further notice,” the advisory said. </p>
<p>Sunday’s missile launch toward the American warship also marked the first U.S.-acknowledged fire by the Houthis since America and allied nations began strikes Friday on the rebels following weeks of assaults on shipping in the Red Sea. </p>
<p>The Houthi fire in the direction of the USS Laboon, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer operating in the southern reaches of the Red Sea, Central Command said. </p>
<p>The missile came from near Hodeida, a Red Sea port city long held by the Houthis, the U.S. said. </p>
<p>“An anti-ship cruise missile was fired from Iranian-backed Houthi militant areas of Yemen toward USS Laboon,” Central Command said. “There were no injuries or damage reported.” </p>
<p>The Houthis did not acknowledge that attack. </p>
<p>It wasn’t presently clear whether the U.S. would retaliate for the latest attacks, though President Joe Biden has said he “will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and the free flow of international commerce as necessary.” </p>
<p>The first day of U.S.-led strikes Friday hit 28 locations and struck more than 60 targets with cruise missiles and bombs launched by fighter jets, warships and a submarine. Sites hit included weapon depots, radars and command centers, including in remote mountain areas, the U.S. has said. </p>
<p>The Houthis have yet to acknowledge how severe the damage was from the strikes, which they said killed five of their troops and wounded six others. </p>
<p>U.S. forces followed up with a strike Saturday on a Houthi radar site.</p>
<p>Since November, the rebels have repeatedly targeted ships in the Red Sea, saying they were avenging Israel’s offensive in Gaza against Hamas. But they have frequently targeted vessels with tenuous or no clear links to Israel, imperiling shipping in a key route for global trade.</p>
<p>Even the leader of the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group, Hassan Nasrallah, obliquely referenced the widening Houthi attacks on ships in a speech Sunday, saying that “the sea has become a battlefield of missiles, drones and warships” and blaming the U.S. strikes for escalating maritime tensions. </p>
<p>“The most dangerous thing is what the Americans did in the Red Sea, (it) will harm the security of all maritime navigation,” Nasrallah said. </p>
<p>Though the Biden administration and its allies have tried to calm tensions in the Middle East for weeks and prevent any wider conflict, the strikes in the Red Sea threaten to ignite one.</p>
<p>It’s also affecting shipping for the Middle East nation of Qatar, one of the world’s top natural gas suppliers. Three liquid natural gas tankers that had recently loaded in Qatar and were bound for the Suez Canal remain idling off Oman, while another coming from Europe to Qatar remains off Saudi Arabia. QatarEnergy and government officials did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, which supports the Yemeni government-in-exile that the Houthis are fighting, sought to distance itself from the attacks on Houthi sites as it tries to maintain a delicate détente with Iran and a cease-fire it has in Yemen. The Saudi-led, U.S.-backed war in Yemen that began in 2015 has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.</p>

<h2 id="pluralistic-sympathy-for-the-spammer-15-jan-2024">Pluralistic: Sympathy for the spammer (15 Jan 2024)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Sympathy for the spammer: The desperate and credulous are superspreaders in the botshit pandemic. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Sympathy for the spammer (permalink) In any scam, any con, any hustle, the big winners are the people who supply the scammers – not the scammers themselves. The kids selling dope on the corner are making less than minimum wage, while the respectable crime-bosses who own the labs clean up. Desperate “retail investors” who buy shitcoins from Superbowl ads get skinned, while the MBA bros who issue the coins make millions (in real dollars, not crypto). It’s ever been thus. The California gold rush was a con, and nearly everyone who went west went broke. Famously, the only reliable way to cash out on the gold rush was to sell “picks and shovels” to the credulous, doomed and desperate. That’s how Leland Stanford made his fortune, which he funneled into eugenics programs (and founding a university): https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/malcolm-harris/palo-alto/9780316592031/ That means that the people who try to con you are almost always getting conned themselves. Think of Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) scams. My forthcoming novel The Bezzle opens with a baroque and improbable fast-food Ponzi in the town of Avalon on the island of Catalina, founded by the chicle monopolist William Wrigley Jr: http://thebezzle.org Wrigley found fast food declasse and banned it from the island, a rule that persists to this day. In The Bezzle, the forensic detective Martin Hench uncovers The Fry Guys, an MLM that flash-freezes contraband burgers and fries smuggled on-island from the mainland and sells them to islanders though an “affiliate marketing” scheme that is really about recruiting other affiliate marketers to sell under you. As with every MLM, the value of the burgers and fries sold is dwarfed by the gigantic edifice of finance fraud built around it, with “points” being bought and sold for real cash, which is snaffled up and sucked out of the island by a greedy mainlander who is behind the scheme. A “bezzle” is John Kenneth Galbraith’s term for “the magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it.” In every scam, there’s a period where everyone feels richer – but only the scammers are actually cleaning up. The wealth of the marks is illusory, but the longer the scammer can preserve the illusion, the more real money the marks will pump into the system. MLMs are particularly ugly, because they target people who are shut out of economic opportunity – women, people of color, working people. These people necessarily rely on social ties for survival, looking after each others’ kids, loaning each other money they can’t afford, sharing what little they have when others have nothing. It’s this social cohesion that MLMs weaponize. Crypto “entrepreneurs” are encouraged to suck in their friends and family by telling them that they’re “building Black wealth.” Working women are exhorted to suck in their bffs by appealing to their sisterhood and the chance for “women to lift each other up.” The “sales people” trying to get you to buy crypto or leggings or supplements are engaged in predatory conduct that will make you financially and socially worse off, wrecking their communities’ finances and shattering the mutual aid survival networks they rely on. But they’re not getting rich on this – they’re also being scammed: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4686468 This really hit home for me in the early 2000s, when I was still editing Boing Boing. We had a submission form where our readers could submit links for us to look at for inclusion on the blog, and it was overwhelmed by spam. We’d add all kinds of antispam to it, and still, we’d get floods of hundreds or even thousands of spam submissions to it. One night, I was lying in my bed in London and watching these spams roll in. They were all for small businesses in the rustbelt, handyman services, lawn-care, odd jobs, that kind of thing. They were 10 million miles from the kind of thing we’d ever post about on Boing Boing. They were coming in so thickly that I literally couldn’t finish downloading my email – the POP session was dropping before I could get all the mail in the spool. I had to ssh into my mail server and delete them by hand. It was maddening. Frustrated and furious, I started calling the phone numbers associated with these small businesses, demanding an explanation. I assumed that they’d hired some kind of sleazy marketing service and I wanted to know who it was so I could give them a piece of my mind. But what I discovered when I got through was much weirder. These people had all been laid off from factories that were shuttering due to globalization. As part of their termination packages, their bosses had offered them “retraining” via “courses” in founding their own businesses. The “courses” were the precursors to the current era’s rise-and-grind hustle-culture scams (again, the only people getting rich from that stuff are the people selling the courses – the “students” finish the course poorer). They promised these laid-off workers, who’d given their lives to their former employers before being discarded, that they just needed to pull themselves up by their own boostraps: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/10/declaration-of-interdependence/#solidarity-forever After all, we had the internet now! There were so many new opportunities to be your own boss! The course came with a dreadful build-your-own-website service, complete with an overpriced domain sales portal, and a single form for submitting your new business to “thousands of search engines.” This was nearly 20 years ago, but even then, there was really only one search engine that mattered: Google. The “thousands of search engines” the scammers promised to submit these desperate peoples’ websites to were just submission forms for directories, indexes, blogs, and mailing lists. The number of directories, indexes, blogs and mailing lists that would publish their submissions was either “zero” or “nearly zero.” There was certainly no possibility that anyone at Boing Boing would ever press the wrong key and accidentally write a 500-word blog post about a leaf-raking service in a collapsing deindustrialized exurb in Kentucky or Ohio. The people who were drowning me in spam weren’t the scammers – they were the scammees. But that’s only half the story. Years later, I discovered how our submission form was getting included in this get-rich-quick’s mass-submission system. It was a MLM! Coders in the former Soviet Union were getting work via darknet websites that promised them relative pittances for every submission form they reverse-engineered and submitted. The smart coders didn’t crack the forms directly – they recruited other, less business-savvy coders to do that for them, and then often as not, ripped them off. The scam economy runs on this kind of indirection, where scammees are turned into scammers, who flood useful and productive and nice spaces with useless dross that doesn’t even make them any money. Take the submission queue at Clarkesworld, the great online science fiction magazine, which famously had to close after it was flooded with thousands of junk submission “written” by LLMs: https://www.npr.org/2023/02/24/1159286436/ai-chatbot-chatgpt-magazine-clarkesworld-artificial-intelligence There was a zero percent chance that Neil Clarke would accidentally accept one of these submissions. They were uniformly terrible. The people submitting these “stories” weren’t frustrated sf writers who’d discovered a “life hack” that let them turn out more brilliant prose at scale. They were scammers who’d been scammed into thinking that AIs were the key to a life of passive income, a 4-Hour Work-Week powered by an AI-based self-licking ice-cream cone: https://pod.link/1651876897/episode/995c8a778ede17d2d7cff393e5203157 This is absolutely classic passive-income brainworms thinking. “I have a bot that can turn out plausible sentences. I will locate places where sentences can be exchanged for money, aim my bot at it, sit back, and count my winnings.” It’s MBA logic on meth: find a thing people pay for, then, without bothering to understand why they pay for that thing, find a way to generate something like it at scale and bombard them with it. Con artists start by conning themselves, with the idea that “you can’t con an honest man.” But the factor that predicts whether someone is connable isn’t their honesty – it’s their desperation. The kid selling drugs on the corner, the mom desperately DMing her high-school friends to sell them leggings, the cousin who insists that you get in on their shitcoin – they’re all doing it because the system is rigged against them, and getting worse every day. These people reason – correctly – that all the people getting really rich are scamming. If Amazon can make $38b/year selling “ads” that push worse products that cost more to the top of their search results, why should the mere fact that an “opportunity” is obviously predatory and fraudulent disqualify it? https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/29/aethelred-the-unready/#not-one-penny-for-tribute The quest for passive income is really the quest for a “greater fool,” the economist’s term for the person who relieves you of the useless crap you just overpaid for. It rots the mind, atomizes communities, shatters solidarity and breeds cynicism: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security The rise and rise of botshit cannot be separated from this phenomenon. The botshit in our search-results, our social media feeds, and our in-boxes isn’t making money for the enshittifiers who send it – rather, they are being hustled by someone who’s selling them the “picks and shovels” for the AI gold rush: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/03/botshit-generative-ai-imminent-threat-democracy That’s the true cost of all the automation-driven unemployment criti-hype: while we’re nowhere near a place where bots can steal your job, we’re certainly at the point where your boss can be suckered into firing you and replacing you with a bot that fails at doing your job: https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/11/robots-stole-my-jerb/#computer-says-no The manic “entrepreneurs” who’ve been stampeded into panic by the (correct) perception that the economy is a game of musical chairs where the number of chairs is decreasing at breakneck speed are easy marks for the Leland Stanfords of AI, who are creating generational wealth for themselves by promising that their bots will automate away all the tedious work that goes into creating value. Expect a lot more Amazon Marketplace products called “I’m sorry, I cannot fulfil this request as it goes against OpenAI use policy”: https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24036156/openai-policy-amazon-ai-listings No one’s going to buy these products, but the AI picks-and-shovels people will still reap a fortune from the attempt. And because history repeats itself, these newly minted billionaires are continuing Leland Stanford’s love affair with eugenics: https://www.truthdig.com/dig-series/eugenics/ The fact that AI spam doesn’t pay is important to the fortunes of AI companies. Most high-value AI applications are very risk-intolerant (self-driving cars, radiology analysis, etc). An AI tool might help a human perform these tasks more accurately – by warning them of things that they’ve missed – but that’s not how AI will turn a profit. There’s no market for AI that makes your workers cost more but makes them better at their jobs: https://locusmag.com/2023/12/commentary-cory-doctorow-what-kind-of-bubble-is-ai/ Plenty of people think that spam might be the elusive high-value, low-risk AI application. But that’s just not true. The point of AI spam is to get clicks from people who are looking for better content. It’s SEO. No one reads 2,000 words of algorithm-pleasing LLM garbage over an omelette recipe and then subscribes to that site’s feed. And the omelette recipe generates pennies for the spammer that posted it. They are doing massive volume in order to make those pennies into dollars. You don’t make money by posting one spam. If every spammer had to pay the actual recovery costs (energy, chillers, capital amortization, wages) for their query, every AI spam would lose (lots of) money. Hustle culture and passive income are about turning other peoples’ dollars into your dimes. It is a negative-sum activity, a net drain on society. Behind every seemingly successful “passive income” is a con artist who’s getting rich by promising – but not delivering – that elusive passive income, and then blaming the victims for not hustling hard enough: https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2023/12/blueprint-trouble (Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0, modified) Hey look at this (permalink) It’s Time to Nationalize and Then Break Up Boeing https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/its-time-to-nationalize-and-then This day in history (permalink) #15yrsago Wingsuit base jumpers are human flying squirrels — video https://vimeo.com/1778399 #10yrsago RIP, Neal Barret Junior https://locusmag.com/2014/01/neal-barrett-jr-1929-2014/ #10yrsago Patent mess goes to the Supreme Court https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/01/supreme-court-looks-to-rein-in-top-patent-court-with-two-new-cases/ #10yrsago Requirements for DRM in HTML5 are a secret https://memex.craphound.com/2014/01/14/requirements-for-drm-in-html5-are-a-secret/ #10yrsago NSA official: mass spying has foiled one (or fewer) plots in its whole history https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/10/nsa-mass-surveillance-powers-john-inglis-npr #5yrsago From the empty, shutdown IRS, automated processes are sending out property seizure notices, and no human can stop them https://theintercept.com/2019/01/14/irs-shutdown-federal-government-shut-down-irs-asset-seizures/ #5yrsago Google Walkout meets #MeToo in a new anti-arbitration campaign https://endforcedarbitration.medium.com/googlers-for-ending-forced-arbitration-launch-public-education-campaign-via-social-media-e46d7608cd0e #5yrsago Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez reaches more people on Twitter than the press and establishment Democrats https://www.axios.com/2019/01/13/ocasio-cortez-dominates-twitter #5yrsago In LA, the teachers of America’s largest school district are on strike https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/la-teachers-working-class-power-labor-strikes #1yrago Kate Beaton’s “Ducks” https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/14/hark-an-oilpatch/#kate-beaton Colophon (permalink) Today’s top sources: Currently writing: A Little Brother short story about DIY insulin PLANNING Picks and Shovels, a Martin Hench noir thriller about the heroic era of the PC.

Roughly 1 million people volunteer to work at polls during presidential elections, but recruiting enough poll workers remains a perennial challenge. Those staff shortages can add to wait times at the polls, which, in turn, can depress voter turnout. Now, as many poll workers grow older and end their service, advocacy groups are pushing for young people to step up. Also: Who says college is just for the young?

<h2 id="a-surgeon-general-report-once-cleared-the-air-about-smoking.-is-it-time-for-one-on-vaping-1">A Surgeon General Report Once Cleared the Air About Smoking. Is it Time for One on Vaping?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Sixty years ago, the U.S. surgeon general released a report that settled a longstanding public debate about the dangers of cigarettes and led to huge changes in smoking in America.  </p>
<p>Today, some public health experts say a similar report could help clear the air about vaping.  </p>
<p>Many U.S. adults believe nicotine vaping is as harmful as — or more dangerous than — cigarette smoking. That’s wrong. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and most scientists agree that, based on available evidence, electronic cigarettes are far less dangerous than traditional cigarettes.  </p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean e-cigarettes are harmless either. And public health experts disagree about exactly how harmful, or helpful, the devices are. Clarifying information is urgently needed, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.  </p>
<p>“There have been so many confusing messages about vaping,” Gostin said. “A surgeon general’s report could clear that all up.”  </p>
<p>One major obstacle: E-cigarettes haven’t been around long enough for scientists to see if vapers develop problems like lung cancer and heart disease.  </p>
<p>“There’s a remarkable lack of evidence,” said Dr. Kelly Henning, who leads the public health program at Bloomberg Philanthropies.</p>
<p>Smoking and Vaping</p>
<p>Cigarette smoking has long been described as the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts the annual toll at 480,000 lives. That count should start to fall around 2030, according to a study published last year by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, thanks in part to a decline in smoking rates that began in the 1960s.  </p>
<p>Back then, ashtrays were everywhere and more than 42% of U.S. adults smoked.  </p>
<p>On Jan. 11, 1964, U.S. Surgeon General Luther Terry released an authoritative report that said smoking causes illness and death — and the government should do something about it. The report is considered a watershed moment: In the decades that followed, warning labels were put on cigarette packs, cigarette commercials were banned, governments raised tobacco taxes and new restrictions were placed on where people could light up.  </p>
<p>By 2022, the adult smoking rate was 11%.  </p>
<p>Some experts believe e-cigarettes deserve some of the credit. The devices were billed as a way to help smokers quit, and the FDA has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes as less-harmful alternatives for adult smokers.  </p>
<p>Vaping’s popularity exploded in the 2010s, among both adults but and teens. In 2014, e-cigarettes surpassed combustible cigarettes as the tobacco product that youth used the most. By 2019, 28% of high schoolers were vaping.</p>
<p>U.S. health officials sounded alarms, fearing that kids hooked on nicotine would rediscover cigarettes. That hasn’t happened. Last year, the high school smoking rate was less than 2% — far lower than the 35% rate seen about 25 years ago.</p>
<p>“That’s a great public health triumph. It’s an almost unbelievable one,” said Kenneth Warner, who studies tobacco-control policies at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>“If it weren’t for e-cigarettes, I think we would be hearing the public health community shouting at the top of their lungs about the success of getting kids not to smoke,” he said.</p>
<p>Vaping’s Benefits and Harms</p>
<p>Cigarettes have been called the deadliest consumer product ever invented. Their smoke contains thousands of chemicals, at least 69 of which can cause cancer. </p>
<p>The vapor from e-cigarettes has been estimated to contain far fewer chemicals, and fewer carcinogens. Some toxic substances are present in both, but show up in much lower concentrations in e-cigarette vapor than in cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that smokers who completely switch to vaping have better lung function and see other health improvements.</p>
<p>“I would much rather see someone vaping than smoking a Marlboro. There is no question in my mind that vaping is safer,” said Donald Shopland, who was a clerk for the committee that generated the 1964 report and is co-author of a forthcoming book on it.</p>
<p>But what about the dangers to people who have never smoked?</p>
<p>There have been 100 to 200 studies looking at vaping, and they are a mixed bag, said Dr. Neal Benowitz, of the University of California, San Francisco, a leading academic voice on nicotine and tobacco addiction. The studies used varying techniques, and many were limited in their ability to separate the effects of vaping from former cigarettes smoking, he said.</p>
<p>“If you look at the research, it’s all over the map,” Warner said.</p>
<p>Studies have detected bronchitis symptoms and aggravation of asthma in young people who vape. Research also indicates vaping also can affect the cells that line the blood vessels and heart, leading to looks for a link to heart disease. Perhaps the most cited concern is nicotine, the stimulant that makes cigarettes and vapes addictive.</p>
<p>Animal studies suggest nicotine exposure in adolescents can affect development of the area of the brain responsible for attention, learning and impulse control. Some research in people suggests a link between vaping and ADHD symptoms, depression and feelings of stress. But experts say that the research is very limited and more work needs to be done.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there’s not even a clear scientific consensus that vaping is an effective way to quit smoking, with different studies coming up with different conclusions.</p>
<p>Clearing the Air</p>
<p>Last month, the World Health Organization raised alarms about the rapidly growing global markets for electronic cigarettes, noting they come in thousands of flavors that attract young people.</p>
<p>In 2016, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said efforts were needed to prevent and reduce e-cigarette use by children and young adults, saying nicotine in any form is unsafe for kids.</p>
<p>About four months before the report’s release, the FDA began taking steps to regulate e-cigarettes, believing they would benefit smokers.</p>
<p>The agency has authorized several e-cigarettes, but it has refused more than 1 million product marketing applications. Critics say the FDA has been unfair and inconsistent in regulation of products.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of different e-cigarette devices sold in the U.S. has boomed, due largely to disposables imported from China that come in fruit and candy flavors. But vaping by youths has recently been falling: Last year, 10% of high school students surveyed said they had used e-cigarettes in the previous month, down from 14% the year before.</p>
<p>Why the decline? “It’s hard to say what’s working,” said Steven Kelder, a University of Texas researcher.</p>
<p>He mentioned a 2019 outbreak of hospitalizations and deaths among people who were vaping products with THC, the chemical that gives marijuana its high.</p>
<p>The illnesses were traced to a thickening agent used in black market vape cartridges, a substance not used in commercial nicotine e-cigarettes. But it may be a reason many Americans think of e-cigarettes as unsafe, Kelder said.</p>
<p>Sherri Mayfield, a 47-year-old postal worker, remembers the 2019 outbreak and reports of rapid illnesses and deaths in youths. Vaping “absolutely” needs to be studied more, Mayfield said last week while on a cigarette break in New York with some co-workers.</p>
<p>“Cigarettes aren’t safe” but at least it can take them decades to destroy your health, she said.</p>
<p>The surgeon general’s office said in a statement that the 1964 report “catalyzed a 60-year movement to address the harmful effects of smoking” and suggested similar action was needed to address youth vaping.</p>
<p>Murthy’s website, however, currently lists neither vaping nor smoking as a priority issue.</p>

In 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated after speaking with striking sanitation workers in Memphis. Strikes have gotten more rare in the decades following King’s murder, but data from Cornell University shows that the number of strikes have been picking up over the last two years. What does that momentum mean for the year ahead? And later, the tide may be turning against noncompete agreements.

<p class="drop-caps">
The news that <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hertz-tesla-ev-selloff" target="_self">Hertz is selling off one-third</a> of its electric vehicle fleet after limited demand and costly repairs means U.S. consumers just got 20,000 more choices when shopping for a used EV. And with prices continuing to fall, now may be one of the best times to snag a pre-owned electric at a nice discount. But buyer beware.
</p>
<p>
Last year, used car prices finally began to slip after pandemic-induced supply issues. EVs led the way, with pre-owned models down 22% from the previous year, <a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/kbb-atp-august-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to <em>Cox Automotive</em></a>. Tesla saw the biggest price drops, specifically with the average Model 3 going for 21% less than the year before. Hertz’s liquidation of its EVs is certainly going to help keep used prices in check, particularly in oversaturated markets.

“EV inventory is already far outpacing current consumer demand,” says Pat Ryan, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.copilotsearch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CoPilot</a>, a AI-driven car shopping assistant. “Used EVs have a market days supply of 51, compared to 43 for used gas-powered cars and 44 for used hybrids.” And it’s even higher for new models.
</p>
<p>
Ryan suggests the reason for the glut comes down to a few issues: Early adopters and luxury buyers made the switch to electric a few years ago, limiting demand while also keeping a steady supply of pre-owned vehicles hitting the market. There’s also price, charging, and even a <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-cars-partisanship-problem" target="_self">partisan divide</a>. And with traditional automakers like GM and Ford overproducing EVs relative to demand (newcomers like Tesla <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">aren’t necessarily seeing similar problems</a>), there are a lot of new and used options to choose from.
</p>
<p>
But for EV shoppers that might be a “potential advantage,” says Ryan. “Now might be a good time to buy as some dealers will likely be hoping to make a deal in order to move inventory off their lots.”
</p>
<p>
What kind of deal is the real question. While <a href="https://www.hertzcarsales.com/certified/Tesla/2021-Tesla-Model+3-eb7434410a0e0a934207aa4589f1fcfc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $21,500 Tesla Model 3</a> may seem enticing, the same issues that plagued Hertz – including the high cost of repairs – should give some buyers pause.
</p>
<p>
“If someone did want to buy a car from Hertz, buyers should be aware that most rental companies fix their vehicles in-house,” says Tom McParland, the owner of <a href="https://automatchconsulting.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Automatch Consulting</a>. “And if the car was involved in an accident that history may never appear on a Carfax.”
</p>
<p>
While fleet vehicles are relatively well-maintained to ensure they’re on the road and making money, anyone that’s regularly rented a car knows the wear and tear is substantial. The high-tech systems that power modern EVs are one thing, but the most costly item – the battery – is where buyers have to be the most vigilant.
</p>
<p>
“The big issue with used EVs is that it is currently difficult to accurately ascertain what the remaining battery life is,” says McParland. Because of that, he says, “a lot of the higher-mile cars will end up wholesaled and picked up by those questionable used car lots with ‘guaranteed credit approval.’”

<p>
“Climate change is a hoax” is <em>soooo </em>2016. In recent years, Republicans have <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self">gotten more savvy</a> in their attacks on climate change — and, by proxy, on <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-inflation-reduction-act-remains-astonishing" target="_self">the Inflation Reduction Act</a>, the landmark climate legislation passed in 2022. These days, it’s less the science of global warming that’s up for debate than the way we’re addressing it. Republicans are now fighting a multi-front battle against EVs, the energy transition, and climate science, on behalf of golden eagles and whales. And no one is leading the charge more obviously — <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/latest-polls/republican/primaries" target="_blank">or quantifiably</a> — than former president and current presidential candidate Donald Trump.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/27/project-2025-dismantle-us-climate-policy-next-republican-president" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the climate agenda on the line</a>, Heatmap is keeping a running list of Trump’s climate-related statements on the campaign trail. We’ve looked at his rallies, his TV appearances, and his comments on social media and put together a list of Trump’s most frequent and glaringly inaccurate claims since he vacated the White House in January 2021.
</p>
<p>
While some of his musings (okay, fine, a lot of them) might be laughably absurd, others might be something you’ve kind of, sort of wondered about, yourself. To help you better separate fact from fiction, we’ve added context and explanation to each quote, along with a bottom-line determination as to the remark’s facticity.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, this list is a work in progress and will be regularly updated and added to in the coming months, so if you’re ever in doubt, know that you can find the answer somewhere in here. For ease of navigation, we’ve broken things down into sections:

<em>“You know they don’t call it global warming so much now, they call it climate change because it wasn’t working … Global warming wasn’t working when it was cooling.

<p>
<strong>Fact check: </strong>The term “climate change” was initially popularized by Republicans. In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/us/a-call-for-softer-greener-language.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">2002 memo</a>, Republican pollster Frank Luntz urged President George W. Bush to drop the phrase “global warming” in favor of “climate change” since the former sounds more “frightening” and “has catastrophic communications attached to it,” while “climate change sounds a more controllable and less emotional challenge.”
</p>
<p>
That said, <strong>scientists generally prefer the term “climate change”</strong> for pretty much exactly the reason Trump highlighted here — because it encompasses phenomena caused by the increase in CO2 in our atmosphere that don’t manifest as warming, like ocean acidification. For the record: Global warming doesn’t mean that the weather will <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/east-west-flood-blizzard-storm" target="_self">never get cold</a>, just that it will get <em>less</em> cold on average, over time. In fact, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-022-00498-3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> shows that the cold parts of the globe are warming much, much faster than the rest.

<p>
<strong>Fact check</strong><strong>: That’s … true, actually.</strong> “When the atmosphere warms, that means it can hold more water,” Matthew Rodell, the deputy director of Earth sciences for hydrosphere, biosphere, and geophysics at NASA, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/03/14/climate/extreme-weather-climate-change.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">who has made an extensive study of extreme drought and deluges</a>, told me. That means there will be both more droughts <em>and </em>more rainfall, even though the two phenomena might appear at a glance to contradict each other.
</p>
<p>
“On the drought side of things, when the air is warmer, more water can evaporate — can be pulled out of the land and out of the plants, into the air, and then transported away,” Rodell explained. “So you have, basically, more water being net removed from an area.” But water in the air has to return to Earth, eventually, in the form of more — and often extreme — rainfall.
</p>
<p>
Shouldn’t those two extremes effectively balance each other out? As Rodell put it to me, “Floods and droughts are both catastrophes.” During a drought, crops die and wells go dry. And while extreme rainfall might refill an aquifer, “if it’s at the point of being extreme and there’s a flood, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/libya-floods-storm-daniel-derna" target="_self">that’s not good, either</a>.” Think about Libya, where extended heavy rains in the summer of 2023 broke through dams and inundated towns, killing 4,300 people, displacing an estimated 44,800 more, and causing <a href="https://www.trtafrika.com/africa/libya-allocates-dollar446m-for-post-flood-repairs-14939356" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">over $60 million in damage</a>.
</p>
<p>
One last thing to mention here: While our ability to determine the precise contribution of climate change to individual extreme weather events is improving rapidly, that is, in some ways, beside the point. Rodell explained that “in terms of the frequency, and looking at all these events together and how they’ve changed over time, we’re seeing that they’re increasing in number and severity in correlation with global warming. That doesn’t mean you can say any particular event is 100% by global warming, but, I mean — statistically, it’s <em>extremely unlikely</em> that this is just a coincidence.”

<p>
<strong>Fact check: While it’s true that the climate has always changed, it hasn’t always changed like <em>this</em>.</strong> The rapid rise in both atmospheric carbon dioxide <em>and </em>observed average surface temperature since the Industrial Revolution can only be credited to humans, and specifically to the burning of fossil fuels, which release CO2, a heat-trapping gas. There is now near-universal<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac2966" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> scientific consensus</a> that the warming we’re witnessing has been caused by human activity.
</p>
<p>
“The most popular climate myths are the ones that are simple and easy to say,” as John Cook, a senior research fellow at Melbourne University’s School of Psychological Sciences who’s made a <a href="https://youtu.be/JuUz2AwoSko?list=PL1xbdG-NAkB1fAyNAWErM4uEXyduldiew&t=750" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specialty</a> of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaa49f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">combatting</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/H5kejSYPD7U" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate disinformation</a>, told me. “It’s the single-cause fallacy, thinking that only one thing can cause natural causes. But you can have other things like human activity that also drive climate change,” Cook added.
</p>
<p>
Start digging into this kind of logic and it quickly falls apart. For example, Trump’s argument is that the climate has changed naturally in the past; therefore, it must be changing naturally now, as well. But, Cook told me, the same logic could also be used to argue, <em>People have died of cancer in the past; therefore, cigarettes don’t cause cancer now</em>.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> For starters, <strong>Trump’s numbers are orders of magnitude off the mark. </strong>The oceans are on track to rise <em>3.5 feet to 7 feet</em> along America’s coastlines by 2100 — well ahead of Trump’s schedule — according to <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/sealevelrise/sealevelrise-tech-report.html#:~:text=About%202%20feet%20(0.6%20meters,the%20end%20of%20this%20century." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an independent assessment</a> conducted by federal scientific agencies. Even if global carbon emissions had peaked in 2020 (<a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021https://www.iea.org/news/global-co2-emissions-rebounded-to-their-highest-level-in-history-in-2021" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">which we know they did not</a>) and declined relatively rapidly thereafter, the oceans would <em>still</em> probably rise more than 3 feet worldwide by 2300 compared to their 2000 levels, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02985-8/tables/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">researchers have found,</a> because so much heat is already trapped in the climate system.
</p>
<p>
According to the <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">latest scientific report</a> from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “sea level rise greater than 15 meters,” or 49 feet, by the year 2300 “cannot be ruled out” in a high-emissions scenario.
</p>
<p>
While unlikely, 49 feet of sea-level rise would be catastrophic. Large swaths of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens would be completely submerged, with waves lapping at the walls of Yankee Stadium and Citi Field. The southern half of Florida would vanish (bye-bye, Mar-a-Lago!). Countries like the Netherlands and Bangladesh would, literally, disappear from the map.
</p>
<p>
As for that supposedly new oceanfront property Trump is so excited about, scientists expect some <a href="https://www.foxweather.com/extreme-weather/study-rising-sea-levels-flood-nearly-650000-oceanfront-properties-us-by-2050" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">650,000 beachfront properties</a> to flood due to sea level rise in the United States by 2050 — not to mention that globally, some <em>230 million people</em> <a href="https://urbanoceanlab.org/sea-level-rise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live within 3 feet</a> of current high-tide lines.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> The U.S. will not “under any circumstances” pay climate reparations to developing nations, climate envoy John Kerry <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66197366" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a> in front of Congress last year. The situation is, however — and unsurprisingly — <strong>more complicated than that</strong>.
</p>
<p>
At COP28 last year, the U.S. pledged $17.5 million to the U.N.’s “loss and damage” fund, which is intended to help developing countries recover from future climate disasters. While some outlets — including <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-loss-damage-reparations-fund" target="_self">this publication</a> — have <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/reparations-fund-historic-but-real-fight-begins-now-climate-campaigners" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">characterized</a> this fund as “reparations,” the fund has more in common with <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/a-hilariously-sad-chart-of-cop28-climate-pledges" target="_self">other international pledges</a> directed at helping developing countries than calls for climate reparations that hold historic polluters morally and financially responsible.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> China, India, and Russia are all Paris Agreement signatories. But even if they truly didn’t “partake” at all in international climate mitigation efforts, <strong>that hardly means the U.S. shouldn’t try to be cleaner</strong>.
</p>
<p>
But let’s take Trump at face value here. When asked to assess if the Paris Agreement gives an unfair advantage to nations like China and India, law professor Daniel Bodansky at the Arizona State University College of Law pointed out <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/01/27/fact-check-paris-climate-agreement-easier-china-india-than-united-states/4276557001/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to <em>USA Today</em></a> that “the United States is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world and has higher per capita emissions than either China or India. It is misleading to point the finger at China and India and label them as the real polluters.”
</p>
<p>
What about the bad air flowing to us “from Asia,” then? This isn’t total nonsense. For one thing, we <em>do</em> all share the same atmosphere; that’s kind of the whole point of the global movement to stop climate change. But more concretely, yes, researchers have found that pollutants from China can make their way to the Western U.S.
</p>
<p>
Here’s where it gets awkward: “An estimated 36% of manmade sulfur dioxide, 27% of nitrogen oxide, 22% of carbon monoxide, and 17% of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_carbon" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">black carbon</a> over China are the result of manufacturing goods for export. About a fifth of each of these was associated with products exported to the U.S. in particular,” <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/air-pollution-china-is-spreading-across-pacific-us-180949395/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Scientific American</em> writes</a>. In other words, a lot of that “bad air” flowing to us from Asia that Trump is complaining about is from manufacturing products for <em>Americans</em>.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> If you ever want to feel ridiculous, try asking a scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration if windmills are making whales “a little batty.”
</p>
<p>
NOAA actively studies how “sound, vessel, and other human activities” impact marine life, Lauren Gaches, the director of NOAA Fisheries Public Affairs, told me over email. “At this point, <strong>there is no scientific evidence that noise resulting from offshore wind site characterization surveys could potentially cause mortality of whales</strong>,” she said.
</p>
<p>
An ongoing “unusual mortality event” for humpback whales has resulted in 200 whale deaths between 2016 and June 2023 along the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida — that much is true. But “there are no known links between recent large whale mortalities and ongoing offshore wind surveys,” Gaches told me. <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/marine-life-distress/frequent-questions-offshore-wind-and-whales" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NOAA’s fact page</a> on whales and offshore wind explains that of “roughly 90 whales examined, about 40% had evidence of human interaction, either ship strike or entanglement.”
</p>
<p>
There has been some chatter about underwater surveying work disrupting whales, which <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/mar/mcbem-2014-01/other/mcbem-2014-01-submission-seismic-airgun-en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">may be true</a> in the case of oil and gas surveys, which use seismic air guns to penetrate deep into the ocean floor. The surveying equipment used for offshore wind is, by contrast, used in 15-second bursts and limited to a specific area, “so the likelihood of an animal encountering and coming right into that sound beam is quite low,” Erica Staaterman, the deputy director for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s Center for Marine Acoustics, said on <a href="https://noaa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/Transcript-011823-NOAA-Fisheries-Media-Teleconference-East-Coast-whale-strandings-508.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a NOAA-hosted call with the press</a> early last year.
</p>
<p>
As Ben Laws, the deputy chief of NOAA’s Permits and Conservation Division in the Office of Protected Resources, said on the same call, “There is no information that would support any suggestion that any of the equipment that’s being used in support of wind development for these site characterization surveys could directly lead to the death of a whale.”

<strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump has had a vendetta against wind turbines since <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/201032113686974464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E201032113686974464%7Ctwgr%5E6ad5e98bc0b4151341e73bac3045d6bae8fea167%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrumparchive.com%2F%3Fsearchbox%3D22wind22results%3D1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">long before</a> he ever ran for president. “Wind farms are killing many thousands of birds,” reads one illustrative tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/236213559191805953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E236213559191805953%7Ctwgr%5E6ad5e98bc0b4151341e73bac3045d6bae8fea167%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetrumparchive.com%2F%3Fsearchbox%3D22wind22results%3D1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">from 2012</a>. “They make hunters look like nice people!”
</p>
<p>
Lewis Grove is the director of wind and energy policy at the American Bird Conservancy, and he told me that while it’s “not necessarily as simple as Mr. Trump painted it out to be, <strong>wind turbines absolutely kill birds</strong>.”
</p>
<p>
But the context here is extremely important. Jason Ryan, a spokesperson for the American Clean Power Association, a leading renewable energy trade group, pointed me to research from the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service that shows wind farms “represent just <a href="https://www.fws.gov/library/collections/threats-birds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">0.03% of all human-related bird deaths in the U.S.</a>” Grove likewise told me that, for the most part, bird deaths due to wind turbines do “not have population-level impacts.”
</p>
<p>
There are exceptions, such as an infamous wind farm in California’s Altamont Pass built in 1981 that “just happened to be in a place that was really heavily used by golden eagles,” Grove told me. Because golden eagle populations were already very low, having <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/campaigns/protecting_birds_of_prey_at_altamont_pass/pdfs/factsheet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100 or so</a> killed a year by turbines was “unsustainable.” Even in a case like this, though, it behooves one to look at the whole picture: “They found it was a few individual turbines that were causing the damage,” Grove said. These days, around 60 golden eagles a year are killed in Alameda County, <a href="https://alamedapost.com/features/alameda-life/making-wind-energy-safer-for-golden-eagles/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the<em> Alameda Post</em> reports</a>, and the operating company must pay steep penalties for eagle deaths.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, “climate change is one of the greatest threats birds face, with <a href="https://www.audubon.org/climate/survivalbydegrees" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">two-thirds of North American species</a> at risk of extinction due to our warming planet,” Jon Belak, senior manager of science and data analysis at The National Audubon Society, told me in a statement. “We need to build more wind and solar facilities to help slow the rise in global temperatures and protect birds and their habitats from a changing climate.”
</p>
<p>
Wind farms may not have population-level impacts on birds, but fracking does — “the onset of shale oil and gas production reduces subsequent bird population counts by 15%,” even after accounting for factors like weather and other land-use changes, according to one just-published, peer-reviewed study.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> “I mean, <strong>it’s possible with any mix of generation that if supply and demand aren’t equal, your TV will go out</strong>. That’s just physics,” Kyri Baker, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me when I asked her if Trump’s scenario had any merit. In other words, a power outage could happen whether your electricity is coming from coal or natural gas or anything else. The difference, she said, is that “wind is by nature variable, intermittent. But it’s also not reliant on fuel like natural gas or coal plants or even nuclear plants are.”

What happens on days when there is no wind? “Grids are extremely regulated,” Baker explained to me. “There’s so many layers of redundancy that aim <em>specifically</em> to not have [an outage] happen.” A grid is made up of diverse electricity sources (for my visual learners, <em>Canary</em> imagines what a net-zero grid could look like <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-what-will-a-net-zero-grid-energy-mix-actually-look-like" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>), as well as measures like offline backup generators, which can kick in if need be, so service isn’t disrupted.
</p>
<p>
Battery storage is another huge part of this equation. While they’re still fairly cutting-edge as climate technology goes, high-capacity batteries that can manage grid-scale energy needs are getting <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/in-boost-for-renewables-grid-scale-battery-storage-is-on-the-rise" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">better</a> and <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2023-10/california-sees-unprecedented-growth-energy-storage-key-component-states-clean" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more plentiful</a>.

But maybe Trump meant atmosphere as in “sense of place”? Most Americans don’t seem to think windmills are “ruining” anything. In <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_self">a recent Heatmap poll</a>, nearly eight in 10 Americans said they want the government to make it <em>easier</em> to build new wind farms. <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2023/10/03/solar-panels-wind-turbines-nimby/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">similarly found last year</a> that about 70% of Americans said they wouldn’t mind living near a wind farm.
</p>
<p>
As my colleague Robinson Meyer <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/renewables-nimby-poll-solar-wind" target="_self">has written</a>, “American laws today give even a small, well-resourced minority plenty of tools to block a project” like a wind farm, and “what’s more, once that small group starts campaigning against a project, the public’s broad but shallow support for, say, a general technology can crater. That’s what happened recently in New Jersey, where a once broadly pro-wind public <a href="https://stockton.edu/news/2023/windmill-support-drops-hughes-poll.html#:~:text=In%202019%2C%2080%25%20of%20adult,today%20by%20the%20William%20J." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">has turned against</a> four proposed offshore wind farms.”

<strong>Fact check: Wind in general is not the most expensive form of energy, but <em>offshore</em> wind is very expensive — for now.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Of the energy sources we’re currently used to, nuclear is usually cited as having the highest levelized cost of electricity — that is, it has the highest average cost per unit of electricity generated after construction, maintenance, and operation have been taken into account. Peaker plants — gas-powered plants that run just during times of peak demand — usually come in second.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://decarbonization.visualcapitalist.com/the-cheapest-sources-of-electricity-in-the-us/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Offshore wind <em>is </em>costly</a>, with the levelized cost of electricity from a subsidized U.S. offshore wind project increasing “to $114.20 per megawatt-hour in 2023, up almost 50% from 2021 levels in nominal terms,” <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/soaring-costs-stress-us-offshore-wind-companies-ruin-margins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BloombergNEF reports</a>. Many of the factors making offshore wind so expensive — including <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self">permitting delays</a>, <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/high-interest-rates-clean-energy" target="_self">high interest rates</a>, and <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/everyones-mad-at-offshore-wind-developers" target="_self">supply chain issues</a> — will abate with time.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> “That question is actually a little bit tricky,” Baker, the assistant professor of engineering at the University of Colorado, told me, when I asked him whether solar alone could power a factory — but <strong>it’s also not really what we should be asking</strong>. “One thing I’ve noticed people do a lot is they’ll just compare efficiency of power generation,” Baker explained. But “it’s not just about the efficiency — it’s about other things, too, like solar’s ability to be distributed. You can’t put a nuclear fission power plant in your house — you know, not yet — but you <em>can</em> put solar panels, so that’s a huge benefit. It offers some resiliency that other sources just can’t offer.”

It’s true that solar power <em>is</em> less efficient than other sources of energy, including wind, and that it requires a lot of surface area, which could be an undue burden for a manufacturer.

<strong>Fact check: It’s not wrong to say that Biden has tried to reduce the role of liquid fuel in vehicles.</strong> Trump has gunned for Iowa voters by claiming Biden’s goal (albeit <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/us/politics/trump-fact-check-electric-vehicles.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not a binding mandate</a>) of ramping up EV sales will kill the local ethanol industry. But Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack — Iowa’s former governor — has stressed that just because the administration is pushing for more EVs, “Does that mean we won’t have a need for E15 or E85” — gasoline blends that contain up to 15% and 85% ethanol content, respectively — “in the future? No.”
</p>
<p>
For example, new rules defining what qualifies as a “sustainable aviation fuel” — and thus for generous tax credits under the IRA — include ethanol and other plant-based fuels, despite <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/us-sustainable-aviation-fuel-emissions-impacts" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opposition</a> from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/looking-for-a-greener-way-to-fly" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">environmental groups</a>. “The Biden administration plans to invest $4.3 billion to support production of 35 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually by 2050,” presenting a significant opportunity for Iowa’s farmers, <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/agriculture/2021/09/12/bidens-electric-car-push-doom-ethanol-farmers-us-ag-secretary-says-no-carbon-emissions-corn/8201034002/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Des Moines Register</em> writes</a>.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> There’s a lot to unpack here, but the gist is that most of <strong>these are the kind of early-stage problems you would find with any emerging technology</strong>. While <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/electric-vehicles/electric-big-rigs-are-going-farther-and-charging-faster" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the technology</a> powering heavy-duty electric trucks is promising, there is still a long way to go when it comes to range and capacity.
</p>
<p>
Still, even a semi that goes only around 375 miles — longer than Trump’s estimate — on a single charge would ultimately be cheaper than a diesel truck, <a href="https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-the-future-of-the-trucking-industry-electric-semi-trucks-2023#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Electric%20Semi%2DTrucks,-Improved%20Health%20and&text=Lower%20Total%20Cost%20of%20Ownership,drivetrain%20also%20reduces%20maintenance%20costs." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">one 2021 study found</a>. Because of the lower cost of ownership, electric semis have a net savings of $200,000 over a 15-year lifespan.

Battery size, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/electric-trucks-longhaul-batteries-tesla-heavy-cargo-weight-problem-2023-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">in particular battery <em>weight</em></a>, will be a major hurdle for long haul electric semis; shipping rates are often determined based on weight, among other factors, and since freight companies already operate on narrow margins, carrying less freight weight is a problem.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump has repeatedly slammed the Biden administration for supposedly wanting to switch to “all-electric” tanks. <strong>This is mostly false</strong>, though it has its roots in the Army’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/02/10/army-military-green-climate-strategy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">first-ever climate strategy</a>, released early last year. In it, the Army stated that it aims to electrify all noncombat vehicles by 2035 and some tactical vehicles by 2050.
</p>
<p>
The reason the Army wants to go electric isn’t because of some woke environmentalist agenda, though. “The primary reason the Army wants to electrify its fighting vehicles is to reduce wartime casualties,” <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/us-armys-electric-tanks-on-hold-as-battery-technology-develops" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Bloomberg</em> writes</a>. “An all-electric fleet would mean personnel wouldn’t have to go on dangerous refueling missions that draw combat forces away from fighting the enemy … [and] electric vehicles are also much quieter and harder to spot on enemy surveillance systems because they generate so little heat.”
</p>
<p>
Trump has also slammed the Air Force for <a href="https://www.safie.hq.af.mil/Programs/Climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its climate action plan</a>, although the roots of his claim that Biden wants to make jet fighters green by “losing 15% efficiency” are much less clear. He may be referring to the Air Force’s <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2819999/the-air-force-partners-with-twelve-proves-its-possible-to-make-jet-fuel-out-of/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exploration of alternative fuels</a> — which again, it is doing primarily for strategic reasons, since the Air Force reports 30% of the casualties in Afghanistan came from attacks on fuel and water convoys. “We’re not doing the climate plan for climate’s sake … Everything is about increasing our combat capability,” Edwin Oshiba, assistant secretary of the Air Force for energy, installations, and the environment, <a href="https://www.afcea.org/signal-media/efficiency-fuels-air-force-climate-change-plan" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association.

Trump further seems to be alluding to Biden’s campaign promise to not approve any new drilling (“ <em>…anywhere in our states!</em>”), but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-resume-oil-gas-drilling-public-land-despite-biden-campaign-pledge-2022-04-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">that hasn’t exactly gone to plan</a>; although Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/27/executive-order-on-tackling-the-climate-crisis-at-home-and-abroad/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">issued a pause</a> on new oil and gas leases on federal lands one week after taking office, the administration then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-resume-oil-gas-drilling-public-land-despite-biden-campaign-pledge-2022-04-15/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lifted that pause</a> a little over a year later in the face of numerous legal and political challenges. Over the summer, however, the Interior Department did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/climate/biden-drilling-federal-lands.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raise the cost of drilling</a> on federal lands.

<strong>Fact check:</strong> Trump made this comment while discussing electric catapults and magnetic elevators on aircraft carriers.

<p>
<strong>Fact check:</strong> As someone who lives in a New York City apartment, I would absolutely describe my dishwasher as “precious and dear,” so that part is true. It is also true that, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/dishwashers-biden-conservatives-culture-war" target="_self">as I explained last year</a>, rules proposed by the Biden administration call for new dishwashers imported and made in the U.S. to use 34% less water, or no more than 3.3 gallons, during their default cycles by 2027. But <strong>it is not true that those dishwashers don’t work</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Energy-efficient dishwashers <em>can </em>take a long time to clean your dishes; many cycles last more than two hours and some up to three. The reason for this is pretty straightforward: In order to achieve the same level of cleanliness as old, water- and energy-inefficient dishwashers, new water- and energy-efficient dishwashers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyOHcNcovYA&ab_channel=ApplianceVideo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">need to swish around longer</a>.
</p>
<p>
But the “default cycles” are the <em>only</em> dishwasher mode the government restricts; “short cycle” modes, which require more water and take less time, are still allowed on dishwashers sold in the U.S. and aren’t regulated by the new rules. That fast mode just can’t be the default. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/dishwashers-trump-efficiency/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">As <em>Wirecutter</em> writes</a>, “crappy cleaning performance and long cycles aren’t an inevitable outcome of efficiency standards,” and “if your dishwasher is slow and sucks (and a better detergent doesn’t fix the problem), blame the company that built it.”

<strong>Fact check: It’s really gas furnace systems that are, technically speaking, dated.</strong> Gas furnaces were considered <a href="https://cycleairfilters.com/blogs/all-about-hvac/history-of-the-forced-air-gas-furnace#:~:text=In%20the%201920s%20and%201930s,for%20their%20efficiency%20and%20reliability." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">state-of-the-art</a> in the 1920s and 1930s, while heat pump technology — which works by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQaycSD5GWE&ab_channel=BCHydro" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">transferring</a>, rather than generating, heat from indoors to outdoors and vice versa — <a href="https://texascooppower.com/heat-pumps-are-back-and-worth-a-look/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">took off in the 1970s</a> as a response to surging oil prices. Heat pumps can be up to five times more efficient than fossil-fuel furnaces, according to electrification advocacy group Rewiring America, which means that at least 70% of people could save money on their energy bills by switching from fossil fuel heaters, the group estimates.
</p>
<p>
The cost of a heat pump itself <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/hvac/heat-pump-cost" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">varies widely</a> depending on size (how much house it has to heat), type (geothermal vs. air source), and efficiency, then when you add in factors like the cost to refit you existing HVAC system and the cost of labor, well, <a href="https://www.blocpower.io/posts/heat-pump-installation-cost-2023-prices-guide" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it adds up</a>. While heat pumps aren’t cheap, they do at least serve as both a furnace <em>and</em> an air conditioner, two appliances for the price of one, an investment that can pay back over time, Rewiring America said.

<h2 id="arctic-freeze-blasts-huge-swaths-of-us-with-sub-zero-temperatures">Arctic Freeze Blasts Huge Swaths of US With Sub-Zero Temperatures</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — A dangerous Arctic blast will continue sweeping across the U.S. on Monday and linger through at least midweek, prolonging a bitter cold that set record-low temperatures in parts of the country and threatens to further disrupt daily life, including an NFL playoff game and the first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest in Iowa.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said wind chills are expected to push temperatures 34 degrees below zero Celsius from the Northern Rockies to northern Kansas and into Iowa, testing the hardiness of caucus-goers willing to brave the deep chill on Monday.</p>
<p>“You can’t sit home,” former President Donald Trump told supporters Sunday. “If you’re sick as a dog, you say, ‘Darling, I gotta make it.’ Even if you vote and then pass away, it’s worth it.”</p>
<p>Arctic storms left at least four dead and knocked out electricity to tens of thousands in the Northwest, brought snow to the South and walloped the Northeast with blizzard conditions forcing the postponement of the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Buffalo Bills NFL playoff game hosted in bone-chilling Buffalo, New York.</p>
<p>The game was scheduled to be held Monday after being canceled Sunday.</p>
<p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Buffalo native, posted a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, showing near-whiteout conditions.</p>
<p>“Conditions right now in Orchard Park, where the game would have started moments ago,” she wrote early Sunday afternoon. “No visibility and dangerously high winds.”</p>
<p>The Bills invited diehard fans to help dig out snow-filled Highmark Stadium, offering $20 an hour for their labor.</p>
<p>“We made progress shoveling, but not much at all,” said Logan Eschrich, a storm chaser who made his way to Buffalo and pitched in.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if the show will go on Monday afternoon. The weather service expects heavy lake-effect snow to push into upstate New York from Lake Erie, adding to the 30.4 to 60.9 centimeters of snow already blanketing the region. Snow fell at a rate of 5 centimeters per hour.</p>
<p>Sub-zero wind chills will grip much of the country, plunging to –45 degrees Celsius in Montana and the Dakotas.</p>
<p>“It takes a matter of minutes for frostbite to set in,” the South Dakota Department of Public Safety said in a statement Sunday urging people to stay indoors.</p>
<p>Other parts of the country could see temperatures drop 25 to 40 degrees below normal, from the Rockies to the Ohio Valley.</p>
<p>As temperatures in Texas plunged, the state’s power grid operator appealed to residents to voluntarily conserve electricity Monday morning due to the cold weather causing “record breaking demand” for energy.</p>
<p>A deadly freeze in 2021 left millions of Texans without power but state officials this week expressed confidence about the grid’s reliability as the cold front approached.</p>
<p>Freezing rain is expected to pelt parts of the Southern Plains and Southern Appalachians.</p>
<p>Even places like Florida won’t be spared from turbulent weather, with forecasts predicting showers and thunderstorms from Monday into Tuesday.</p>
<p>In Oregon, more than 120,000 homes and businesses were without electricity, most of them in the Portland metro area, a day after high winds and a mix of snow and ice brought down trees and power lines.</p>
<p>Some 100 trees toppled over the weekend in a community just south of Portland, including one that fell on a house and killed a man. Two other people died of suspected hypothermia and a fourth died in a fire that spread from an open-flame stove after a tree fell onto an RV.</p>
<p>“Given the extent of the damage and the high level of outage events, restoration efforts will continue into the week and customers are encouraged to plan accordingly,” Portland General Electric said in a statement. The utility said it was watching a second weather pattern that could bring high winds and freezing rain on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Widespread power outages affecting tens of thousands were also reported Sunday in Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In Nebraska, the Omaha Public Power District asked customers to conserve electricity to prevent outages.</p>
<p>Airports across the country were impacted. More than half of flights into and out of Buffalo Niagara International Airport were canceled. Scores of flights also were canceled or delayed at Chicago, Denver and Seattle-Tacoma airports.</p>

<h2 id="deaths-in-rio-grande-intensify-tensions-between-texas-biden-administration">Deaths in Rio Grande Intensify Tensions Between Texas, Biden Administration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BROWNSVILLE, Texas — After Texas fenced off a park along the U.S.-Mexico border and began turning away Border Patrol agents, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott explained why at a campaign stop near Houston.</p>
<p>“We are not allowing Border Patrol on that property anymore,” Abbott said Friday, drawing applause from supporters while endorsing a state legislator running for reelection. He relayed frustration over migrants illegally entering the U.S. through the border city of Eagle Pass and federal agents loading them onto buses.</p>
<p>“We said, ‘We’ve had it. We’re not going to let this happen anymore,’” Abbott said.</p>
<p>Later that night, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said three migrants, including two children, drowned near the park after Texas officials “physically barred” Border Patrol agents from entering. Mexican authorities pulled the bodies, each of them wearing jackets, from the water on the other side of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>The weekend deaths intensified tensions between Texas and the Biden administration. </p>
<p>They also unleashed a new round of criticism from Democrats over Abbott’s aggressive actions to curb illegal crossings, accusing the measures of putting migrants at risk. U.S. authorities described the drownings as underscoring the need for Border Patrol agents to have access to the area around Shelby Park, which Texas closed off earlier this week.</p>
<p>“U.S. Border Patrol must have access to the border to enforce our laws,” White House spokesman Angelo Fernández Hernández said in a statement.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, the Texas Military Department released a statement disputing the U.S. government’s accounts, calling it “wholly inaccurate” that state personnel prevented Border Patrol from saving drowning migrants.</p>
<p>“At the time that Border Patrol requested access, the drownings had occurred, Mexican authorities were recovering the bodies, and Border Patrol expressed these facts to the TMD personnel on site,” the department said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration stuck to its initial account Sunday, saying in a letter to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that Texas denied Border Patrol agents access before they knew the migrants died. In a direct contradiction of Texas’ version of events, Homeland Security said agents at the time knew only that migrants were attempting to cross the river.</p>
<p>“Texas has demonstrated that even in the most exigent circumstances, it will not allow Border Patrol agents access to the border to conduct law enforcement and emergency response activities,” wrote Jonathan E. Meyer, Homeland Security’s general counsel.</p>
<p>Meyer threatened legal action if Texas doesn’t restore access by the end of Wednesday.</p>
<p>The park lies in a major corridor for migrants entering illegally from Mexico and is at the center of Abbott’s aggressive attempts to stop them, known as Operation Lone Star. Migrants are periodically swept away to their deaths by the current of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who represents a Texas border district, acknowledged Sunday that state officials investigated the distress call and searched for the migrants.</p>
<p>“However, the bottom line is that Border Patrol was barred from entering Shelby Park,” Cuellar said in a statement.</p>
<p>Texas officials said Border Patrol agents had requested access to find other migrants who were presumed to have been with those who died. Two were apprehended by state military personnel, including one who was transferred to medics with “hypothermic conditions.” The statement did not say whether Border Patrol agents were allowed in the park.</p>
<p>Over the summer, thousands of people were crossing illegally into the U.S. through Eagle Pass. The numbers subsided but again rose in December when thousands of migrants overwhelmed federal resources. But a sharp decrease was noted at the start of January after Mexico stepped up immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>The 20-hectare park is owned by the city, but it is used by the state Department of Public Safety and the Texas Military Department to patrol border crossings. Earlier this week, Eagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas questioned why the state closed the park now, since daily apprehensions in the region have fallen in recent weeks. He said the state gave city officials no warning and offered no timetable on when the park would reopen.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Justice Department told the U.S. Supreme Court that Texas had taken control of Shelby Park and was not letting Border Patrol agents enter. Texas acknowledged seizing the city park but told the court the federal government had mischaracterized its actions and that it was trying to resolve any disputes over access.</p>
<p>Texas has come under recurring scrutiny over efforts to curb border crossings. Abbott has sent more than 100,000 migrants on buses to Democratic-led cities, even as frigid conditions set in during the winter. He also has strung up razor wire on the border and installed buoy barriers on the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Melissa R. Cigarroa, a city council member in Laredo and member of the No Border Wall Coalition, was among those who attended a vigil Saturday at Shelby Park to mark the deaths of migrants who have died along the Rio Grande. She said attendees passed through a gate with armed National Guard members and that they could see law enforcement officers and vehicles gathered near the river.</p>

<h2 id="us-congressional-leaders-unveil-bill-to-avert-shutdown">US Congressional Leaders Unveil Bill to Avert Shutdown</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Democratic and Republican leaders in the U.S. Congress Sunday unveiled a short-term spending bill that would avert a partial government shutdown and keep federal agencies operating into March.</p>
<p>The agreement aims to avert short-term chaos and buy more time to craft the complex spending legislation that funds government activity.</p>
<p>Government agencies that oversee transportation, housing, and other services are due to run out of funding by midnight on Friday and would have to scale back activity if new funding is not signed into law.</p>
<p>The Democratic-led Senate and Republican-controlled House of Representatives have been at odds over spending levels for months.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer agreed on the measure with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries.</p>
<p>The legislation could run into difficulty in the House, where a faction of conservative Republicans have used disruptive tactics to press for lower spending levels.</p>
<p>Republicans control the chamber with a narrow 219-213 majority, leaving Johnson with little room for error. Some Republicans insist that any spending bills must also clamp down on the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>Current funding is due to expire this week for federal programs involving transportation, housing, agriculture, energy, veterans and military construction.</p>
<p>Funding for other parts of the government, including defense, will continue through Feb. 2.</p>
<p>The new spending bill would extend the deadline to March 1 for the first group and March 8 for the second. Schumer, the top Democrat in Congress, and Johnson, the top Republican, have agreed on a $1.59 trillion total for those bills.</p>
<p>That would give lawmakers more time to negotiate and pass the detailed spending legislation they should have passed before the start of the government’s fiscal year on Oct. 1, 2023.</p>
<p>The legislation covers roughly one-third of U.S. government spending, which amounted to $6.1 trillion in the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The remaining two-thirds includes retirement and health benefits which do not need to be approved annually by Congress, as well as interest payments.</p>
<p>Johnson spent much of last week in meetings with hardliners and other segments of his Republican conference, raising speculation that he could seek to revise his agreement with Schumer. But the speaker ultimately stood by the deal.</p>
<p>The federal government came close to a partial shutdown last autumn, when hardline Republicans ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy for reaching a bipartisan stopgap spending deal with Schumer.</p>

<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>You hear sometimes, now that we know the sordid details of the lives of some of our leading figures, that America has no heroes left. When I was writing a book about the Wounded Knee Massacre, where heroism was pretty thin on the ground, I gave that a lot of thought. And I came to believe that heroism is neither being perfect, nor doing something spectacular. In fact, it’s just the opposite: it’s regular, flawed human beings choosing to put others before themselves, even at great cost, even if no one will ever know, even as they realize the walls might be closing in around them.</p>

<h2 id="us-ambassador-to-kazakhstan-outlines-us-engagement-in-central-asia">US Ambassador to Kazakhstan Outlines US Engagement in Central Asia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-01-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. strategic interests in Central Asia boil down to stability and sovereignty, according to Washington’s top diplomat in Kazakhstan, an oil-rich republic sharing long borders with Russia and China. </p>
<p>With an eye on the ongoing Russian aggression against Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic, the countries in the region have adopted a hedging strategy, maintaining deep links to Moscow while also bolstering relations with the West.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to Kazakhstan Daniel Rosenblum told the Caspian Policy Center gathering on Jan. 4, that the main goal of U.S. policy for Central Asia is to ensure that Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan “stand on their own, be fully sovereign and independent countries that can make their own choices about who to associate with, who to trade with, who to have relations with — without undue external pressure.” </p>
<p>Rosenblum pointed to the so-called C5+1 group, including the United States and the five republics, underlining its “value in acting as a group, integrating with one another, cooperating — that makes each of them stronger individually.” </p>
<p>A second focus for Washington is border security and counterterrorism, a third is boosting trade and investment, and a fourth is promoting human rights and the rule of law, he said.</p>
<p>Economic and political aspects</p>
<p>Kazakhstan is America’s top business partner in Central Asia, with $3 billion in bilateral trade in 2022 and an estimated 15% increase last year, plus $5 billion direct investment in 2023.</p>
<p>Despite holding regular talks on human rights, Rosenblum said Washington and Astana “do not see eye-to-eye” on the lack of meaningful political competition and the continuous arrests of critical voices.</p>
<p>The New York-based Human Rights Watch sites enduring concerns.</p>
<p>“Two years after large-scale anti-government protests rocked Kazakhstan in January 2022, few officials have been held accountable for their part in [the] disproportionate use of force against protesters, arbitrary arrests and imprisonment, and torture and ill-treatment of detainees,” HRW stated in its annual report issued this week.</p>
<p>“When I arrived in November 2022, there were seven names on the list [of political prisoners], which had been going down steadily. And now there are 23, which is not a good trend,” Rosenblum said.</p>
<p>Akbota Karibayeva, a Ph.D. candidate at the George Washington University, agreed with Rosenblum, stressing that President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s transformation package branded as the “New Kazakhstan” has not yet had major effects.</p>
<p>“In the ‘New Kazakhstan,’ we continue to see a familiar cycle of detaining activists for expressing their opinions and repeatedly denying registration to opposition movements. The space for dissenting voices has barely expanded, if at all,” Karibayeva told VOA. </p>
<p>Asserting that Astana is complying with sanctions against Russia, Rosenblum pointed to the U.S., EU and U.K. comprised list of 45 categories of goods.</p>
<p>“Those 45, our experts say, are less than 2% of Kazakhstan’s exports to Russia. Even if they weren’t controlling it at all, it would not constitute more than 2%,” he said.</p>
<p>Rosenblum defended Kazakhstan, which has a 7,644-kilometer border with Russia.</p>
<p>“Since the sanctions were first imposed back in 2022, Kazakhstan’s record, I’d argue, is a good one, both in terms of their ability to prevent sanctions evasion and also making sure that they’re complying with all the sanctions when it comes to their domestic companies, relationships with Russian companies, Russian banks, and so on,” he said.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan last month removed the Taliban from its list of terrorist groups. </p>
<p>“They gave us advance notice that they were doing this, which is in the spirit of the partnership of no surprises,” Rosenblum said. “Kazakhstan has made clear that it will not recognize the Taliban government, and that remains its position until there’s an international consensus and certain benchmarks are made. And this doesn’t change that. They’ve also made clear that they prioritize developing some level of economic relations with Afghanistan, even with the Taliban regime in charge there.”</p>
<p>Kazakhstan vs. Uzbekistan</p>
<p>Before his current assignment, Rosenblum served as ambassador to Uzbekistan, whose leadership has also promised reforms. </p>
<p>“When I arrived in Tashkent [in 2019], it was already a couple of years into the reform process. … Things were slowing down,” he said.</p>
<p>In Rosenblum’s view, Uzbekistan’s initial steps toward change were dramatic, despite the backslidings many observe now, specifically the systemic challenges, testing President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s commitment and his regime’s willingness to transition from an ingrained authoritarian government to a democratic one. </p>
<p>Kazakhstan, he said, has cycled through reform phases producing limited advances, “as opposed to what was really like a sea change, kind of a watershed in Uzbekistan, where suddenly the closed system was opened up.” </p>
<p>Since 2022, following the January civil unrest that left at least 227 dead, Kazakhstan changed its constitution, held presidential and parliamentary elections that Tokayev coined as “democratic” despite the lack of opposition. He has vowed to leave office in 2029, at the end of his seven-year presidential term. </p>
<p>Tokayev pledged to decentralize power and strengthen local governance, moves that Rosenblum said are still unfolding.</p>
<p>“The jury is still out. We have to give some time to see,” he said.</p>
<p>China, Russia, Iran </p>
<p>One issue Washington and Astana disagree on is China’s treatment of Uyghurs, atrocities that the U.S. considers a genocide and crimes against humanity. Yet Rosenblum sees some daylight there.</p>
<p>“There are some Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs who are able to cross the border. They don’t necessarily receive refugee status, but they’ve essentially taken refuge in Kazakhstan, which has lived up to its international obligations of nonrefoulement,” he said, referring to the principle that asylum-seekers should not be returned to countries where they face serious threat to life or freedom. </p>
<p>“They do not send people back to China,” he said. </p>
<p>Kazakhstan’s trade with China recently surpassed $30 billion, which is 10 times more than its trade with the United States, which Rosenblum said he does not find surprising “since they are close neighbors.”</p>
<p>“Kazakhs are sort of bullish on economic relations with China. They are not as exposed or as vulnerable, arguably, as other Central Asian countries because they haven’t taken on nearly as much Chinese debt,” he said.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan will continue to diversify its political and economic partnerships, Rosenblum predicted, despite China’s growing influence and the country’s continuing dependence on Russia for energy.</p>
<p>Russian nationalists’ frequent calls to annex Kazakhstan are viewed alarmingly in Astana, Rosenblum said, but he added, “I don’t feel like there’s a sense of any imminent danger or threat to the northern border of Kazakhstan.”</p>
<p>As part of the Moscow-led Eurasian Economic Union, Kazakhstan recently signed a free trade deal with Iran. Rosenblum said Astana consults with Washington on this issue as well. </p>
<p>“The Kazakh government by now has learned what’s sanctionable and what isn’t,” he said.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan, a regional leader?</p>
<p>While Rosenblum praised Kazakhstan as a “consistent pusher” for regional unity and connectivity, Karibayeva argued that to become a real catalyst for change in Central Asia, her country must lead by example.</p>
<p>“Symbolic gestures and high-level engagements among Central Asian countries and with the United States are important signals of commitment. But it is now essential to progress beyond discussions and focus on implementation at every level of cooperation,” she told VOA.</p>
