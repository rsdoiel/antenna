started a social club in Silicon Valley with the name that guaranteed it
would never be written about in one of the local news journals, as are
by now probably defunct. ‚ÄôTwas a long time ago, we were much younger and

<h2 id="generative-ai-the-power-and-the-glory">Generative AI ‚Äì The Power
and the Glory</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-12, updated: 2025-01-12, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/liebreich-generative-ai-the-power-and-the-glory/">Generative
AI ‚Äì The Power and the Glory</a></strong>
</p>
Michael Liebreich‚Äôs epic report for BloombergNEF on the current state of
play with regards to generative AI, energy usage and data center growth.
</p>
<p>
I learned <em>so much</em> from reading this. If you‚Äôre at all
interested in the energy impact of the latest wave of AI tools I
recommend spending some time with this article.
</p>
<p>
Just a few of the points that stood out to me:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
This isn‚Äôt the first time a leap in data center power use has been
predicted. In 2007 the EPA predicted data center energy usage would
double: it didn‚Äôt, thanks to efficiency gains from better servers and
the shift from in-house to cloud hosting. In 2017 the WEF predicted
cryptocurrency could consume <em>al</em> the world‚Äôs electric power by
2020, which was cut short by the first crypto bubble burst. Is this time
different? <em>Maybe</em>.
</li>
<li>
Michael re-iterates (Sequoia) David Cahn‚Äôs
<a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">$600B
question</a>, pointing out that if the anticipated infrastructure spend
on AI requires $600bn in annual revenue that means 1 billion people will
need to spend $600/year or 100 million intensive users will need to
spend $6,000/year.
</li>
<li>
Existing data centers often have a power capacity of less than 10MW, but
new AI-training focused data centers tend to be in the 75-150MW range,
due to the need to colocate vast numbers of GPUs for efficient
communication between them - these can at least be located anywhere in
the world. Inference is a lot less demanding as the GPUs don‚Äôt need to
collaborate in the same way, but it needs to be close to human
population centers to provide low latency responses.
</li>
<li>
NVIDIA are claiming huge efficiency gains. ‚ÄúNvidia claims to have
delivered a 45,000 improvement in energy efficiency per token (a unit of
data processed by AI models) over the past eight years‚Äù - and that
‚Äútraining a 1.8 trillion-parameter model using Blackwell GPUs, which
only required 4MW, versus 15MW using the previous Hopper architecture‚Äù.
</li>
<li>
Michael‚Äôs own global estimate is ‚Äú45GW of additional demand by 2030‚Äù,
which he points out is ‚Äúequivalent to one third of the power demand from
the world‚Äôs aluminum smelters‚Äù. But much of this demand needs to be
local, which makes things a lot more challenging, especially given the
need to integrate with the existing grid.
</li>
<li>
Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon all have net-zero emission targets
which they take very seriously, making them ‚Äúsome of the most
significant corporate purchasers of renewable energy in the world‚Äù. This
helps explain why they‚Äôre taking very real interest in nuclear power.
</li>
<li>
<p>
Elon‚Äôs 100,000-GPU data center in Memphis currently runs on gas:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When Elon Musk rushed to get x.AI‚Äôs Memphis Supercluster up and running
in record time, he brought in 14 mobile
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/nx-s1-5088134/elon-musk-ai-xai-supercomputer-memphis-pollution">natural
gas-powered generators</a>,¬†each of them generating 2.5MW. It seems they
do not require an air quality permit, as long as they do not remain in
the same location for more than 364 days.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Here‚Äôs a reassuring statistic: ‚Äú91% of all new power capacity added
worldwide in 2023 was wind and solar‚Äù.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There‚Äôs so much more in there, I feel like I‚Äôm doing the article a
disservice by attempting to extract just the points above.
</p>
<p>
Michael‚Äôs conclusion is somewhat optimistic:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the end, the tech titans will find out that the best way to power AI
data centers is in the traditional way, by building the same generating
technologies as are proving most cost effective for other users,
connecting them to a robust and resilient grid, and working with local
communities. [‚Ä¶]
</p>
<p>
When it comes to new technologies ‚Äì be it SMRs, fusion, novel renewables
or superconducting transmission lines ‚Äì it is a blessing to have some
cash-rich, technologically advanced, risk-tolerant players creating
demand, which has for decades been missing in low-growth developed world
power markets.
</p>

<h2 id="agents">Agents</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-11, updated: 2025-01-11, from: Simon Willison‚Äôs
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html">Agents</a></strong>
</p>
Chip Huyen‚Äôs 8,000 word practical guide to building useful LLM-driven
workflows that take advantage of tools.
</p>
<p>
Chip starts by providing a definition of ‚Äúagents‚Äù to be used in the
piece - in this case it‚Äôs LLM systems that plan an approach and then run
tools in a loop until a goal is achieved. I like how she ties it back to
the classic Norvig ‚Äúthermostat‚Äù model - where an agent is ‚Äúanything that
can perceive its environment and act upon that environment‚Äù - by
classifying tools as <em>read-only actions</em> (sensors) and <em>write
actions</em> (actuators).
</p>
<p>
There‚Äôs a lot of great advice in this piece. The section
<a href="https://huyenchip.com/2025/01/07/agents.html#plan_generation">on
planning</a> is particularly strong, showing a system prompt with
embedded examples and offering these tips on improving the planning
process:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Write a better system prompt with more examples.
</li>
<li>
Give better descriptions of the tools and their parameters so that the
model understands them better.
</li>
<li>
Rewrite the functions themselves to make them simpler, such as
refactoring a complex function into two simpler functions.
</li>
<li>
Use a stronger model. In general, stronger models are better at
planning.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
<p>The article is adapted from Chip‚Äôs brand new O‚ÄôReilly book
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/">AI
Engineering</a>. I think this is an excellent advertisement for the book
itself.</p>
