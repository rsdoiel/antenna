A growing number of Windows laptops feature fingerprint sensors with
support for Microsoft’s Windows Hello technology. The idea is to let
users login quickly by tapping a finger against the sensor rather than
typing in a password or PIN. But security researchers at Blackwing
Intelligence have found “multiple vulnerabilities” in the implementation
of these fingerprint […]

<h2 id="gesinnung-ist-sehr-reduktiv">Gesinnung ist sehr reduktiv</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Gesinnung ist sehr reduktiv
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@HeyeBodo" title="@HeyeBodo@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="HeyeBodo">@HeyeBodo</span></a> fragte
letzthin, ob Gesinnung weg kann. Kann weg, meiner Meinung nach.
</p>
<p>
In <a href="Hellebarden_und_Helme">Hellebarden &amp; Helme</a> habe ich
ja die drei Gesinnungen, welche viele von uns wegen Elric von Melniboné
kennen: Ordnung, Chaos, und die Neutralität. Dazu hat’s eine Seite im
Regelbuch, die mir immer noch gefällt. Die Passage hatte ich schon
<a href="2011-06-25_Gesinnung">2011</a>…
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Wähle eine Gesinnung: Ordnung, Chaos oder Neutralität.
</p>
<p>
Die <em>Priester der Ordnung</em> sagen: „Alleine sind wir schwach und
das Leben ein Jammertal. Gemeinsam sind wir stark. Gemeinsam bauen wir
unsere Häuser. Gemeinsam bestellen wir unsere Felder. Gemeinsam
verteidigen wir unsere Städte und Dörfer. Nur gemeinsam sind wir stark.
Wir bauen Dämme gegen die Flut. Wir bauen Aquädukte gegen die Dürre. Wir
bauen Kanäle gegen die Seuchen. Wir legen die Sümpfe trocken und drängen
das Fieber zurück. Wir füllen die Kornspeicher und besiegen den Hunger.
Wir bestrafen den Verrat und belohnen die Treue. Wir sorgen für Recht
und Gerechtigkeit. Selbst wenn das korrumpierende Chaos und die Anarchie
um sich greifen, bleibt uns immer noch die himmlische Ordnung von den
höchsten Göttern im Himmel bis hin zu den schlimmsten Teufeln in der
Hölle. Sie sorgen dafür, dass Strafe und Belohnung nicht vergessen gehen
– jetzt nicht und bis in alle Ewigkeit nicht. In unserer Welt hat jeder
seinen Platz und es hat einen Platz für jeden – auch für dich. Sieh
diese Bücher: das Wissen der Altvorderen, die Gesetze und Tafeln unserer
Ahnen. Es ist unser Erbe. Lerne soviel du kannst, arbeite hart und
erhebe dein Haupt. Steige auf! Werde ein echtes Mitglied unserer stolzen
Gesellschaft!“
</p>
<p>
Die <em>Chaos Priester</em> sagen: „Das Leben ist Chaos. Unkraut wächst
im Feld. Der Obstgarten verwaldet. Die Küste wird ins Meer gespült. Das
Chaos sind die tiefen Muster dieser Welt. Die Wolken gleiten jede für
sich im stillen Tanz über den Himmel. Der Fluss fliesst in tausend
Windungen zum Meer. Die Elfen leben in den Bäumen, ohne sie zu fällen
und zu töten, sie in Bretter zu zersägen und diese dann morsch werden
und faulen sehen zu lassen. Nein, die Elfen beobachten die Muster, nach
denen die Bäume wachsen, formen sie langsam, leben mit ihnen. Der Baum
lebt. Der Elf lebt. Die Ordnung ist die Hybris zu glauben, dass man der
Welt seinen Willen aufzwingen kann. Sie verdammt Mann, Frau und Kind zum
Joch. Chaos ist nicht das Niederbrennen der Städte, sondern die
Einsicht, dass es eine Dummheit war, sie überhaupt zu bauen. Cha- os ist
nicht Gesetzlosigkeit, sondern die Einsicht, dass Menschen, wie Bäume,
eine eigene Art zu leben haben. Wer Gesetze aufstellt, ohne dies zu
bedenken, heisst Menschen töten und sie in Bretterkis- ten begraben.
Komm mit! Ich weiss nicht wohin wir gehen, aber wir werden auf dem Weg
so manches lernen.“
</p>
<p>
Wer sich aus diesem kosmischen Kampf heraushalten will, bekennt sich zur
<em>Neutralität</em>. Es gibt keine Priester der Neutralität.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dazu hat es noch folgende Liste, welche natürlich einen Zusammenhang mit
der gestern diskutierten <a href="2023-11-21-kosmologie">Kosmologie</a>
hat.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Charaktere können sich einen auch einen Schutzpatron aussuchen.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Orcus</em>, Herr über die Untoten, lässt Tote wieder auferstehen
</li>
<li>
<em>Ishtar</em>, Eifersucht und amour fou, Krieg, Abstieg in die
Unterwelt auf der Suche nach dem Liebsten
</li>
<li>
<em>Nergal</em>, Rache, Ungeziefer, Ratten und Seuchen, Herr der
Unterwelt
</li>
<li>
<em>Freya</em>, Ernte, Kreislauf des Lebens, Wölfe, Wildnis und freie
Liebe
</li>
<li>
<em>Marduk</em>, Kampf gegen die Monster, Kriegsfürst, Herrschaft
</li>
<li>
<em>Mitra</em>, Feuer, Ehrlichkeit, Verträge und Schwüre
</li>
<li>
<em>Set</em>, Schläue, Heimlichkeit und Mörder
</li>
<li>
<em>Hekate</em>, Magie, Hexen, Wegkreuzungen
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Wie man auch sieht, ist die Liste nicht immer gleich. 😁
</p>
<p>
Aber <em>eigentlich</em> kann die Gesinnung weg. Wenn auf dem
Charakterblatt steht: “chaotisch”, dann frage ich mich, was das
bedeutet. Und wenn ich darauf eine Antwort habe, dann frage ich mich,
warum das nicht gleich da stand.
</p>
<p>
Wenn es nur darum geht, zwei Seiten in einem grossen Spiel zu benennen,
ist man besser spezifisch. Man könnte Gondor, Mordor oder Angmar
schreiben. Oder Orks, Elfen, Zwerge und Menschen. Oder Ostblock,
Westblock und Unabhängige. So könnte man sich die ganze Amateurethik
sparen. Was heisst rechtschaffen gut? Rechtschaffen böse? Ja was genau?
Eine ernste dazu ist mir zu langweilig. Nennt es Militärdiktatur. Nennt
es Stasi. Nennt es Geheimpolizei. K&amp;K unter den Habsburgern oder
Nordkorea heute, all diese Alternativen sind bessere Worte, viel
reicher, vielschichtiger, bildungswürdiger.
</p>
<p>
Selbst die Planescapephilosophen mit Knüppeln sind cooler als die
Neunfeldergesinnung! Andere Worte sind gefragt, angepasst an die
Spielwelt. Wie heissen denn die kosmischen Seiten? Oder wie heissen die
Allianzen im grossen Krieg? Was gibt es für Zwischentöne? Wie steht es
mit Diplomatie und Vermittlung zwischen den unterschiedlichen Polen? All
dies und vieles mehr ist cool. Ich schimpfe nur auf die flache Wortwahl
der Neunfeldergesinnung.
</p>
<p>
Was meiner Meinung ebenfalls keinen Wert hat, sind Gesinnungen, die
einmal gewählt werden und dann einen Einfluss auf Schutzzauber haben,
oder auf die Verwendungsmöglichkeit dieser oder jener magischen Waffe.
Wie viel davon verlangt interessante Entscheidungen? Falls es keine
Entscheidungen abverlangt, dann bleiben mir nur die spezifischen Regeln
der Welt, die Klassen, die Reaktionswürfen, die Sprachen der heiligen
Texte, die Dialekte des Untergrunds, und so weiter. Doch das gibt es ja
alles auch ohne Gesinnung!
</p>
<p>
Von dem her: Gesinnung bietet keinen Mehrwert.
</p>
<p>
Nur das Gesäusel der Priester der Ordnung und der Priester des Chaos
gefällt mir, als eine Beschreibung der Konflikte, die ich gerne
anspiele: Zeit für Unsterbliche, Bauwerke und die Natur, Freiheit und
Kooperation, das sind die Themen, die ich selber aus Ordnung und Chaos
herauslese. Und dieses mehr an Worten macht für mich den Unterschied
aus. Wenn die Gesinnung nur ein oder zwei Worte sind, dann ist das
langweilig. Mehr Worte braucht das Land.

<p>
I’m in the unique position of owning a collection of Raspberry Pi
Compute Modules 4 (CM4).
</p>
<p>
I also own at least one of every production CM4 clone in existence.
</p>
<p>
This sets up a quandary: if I have <em>the real thing</em>, what
motivation do I have to care about the clones?
</p>
<p>
There are
<a href="https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/boards_cm"><em>hundreds</em> of
CM4 carrier boards</a> that do everything from restoring retro game
consoles to monitoring remote oil rigs in highly-explosive environments.
</p>
<p>
Since launch, the CM4 has been difficult—and since early 2021,
<em>impossible</em>—to acquire. The supply constraints are well
documented, and I’m sure a few comments will lament the situation. But
the CM4 is <a href="https://rpilocator.com/?cat=CM4">trickling back to
‘in stock’</a> at many suppliers (about how the Pi 4 was a couple months
ago).

WordPress</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Thinking about WordPress this morning, APIs and feeds.
</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2023/04/24/cheshireCat.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">This
last year I’ve caught up with WordPress, have been asking questions, and
one of the best thing about
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/11/12.html#a142810">my work with
Automattic</a> is that the doors have been open. I have great teachers
who are encouraging me, and of course are experts in and proud of
WordPress, and as a result I think
<a href="https://feedland.org/">FeedLand</a> and
<a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> are going to work
together in some very nice ways. Getting pretty close on some of it.
</p>
<p>
A year ago I didn’t even know that WordPress still had APIs. At some
point the code I had that worked with WordPress via the
<a href="http://xmlrpc.com/metaweblog">MetaWeblog API</a> broke, and I
assumed that it was the end of the line, and took the feature out of my
linkblogging tool. But I was wrong. And not only that there was

<h2 id="pluralistic-dont-be-evil-22-nov-2023">Pluralistic: Don’t Be Evil
(22 Nov 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Don’t Be Evil: My new Locus Column. Hey look at this:
Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2013, 2018, 2022
Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current
writing projects, current reading Don’t Be Evil (permalink) My latest
Locus Magazine column is “Don’t Be Evil,” a consideration of the forces
that led to the Great Enshittening, the dizzying, rapid transformation
of formerly useful services went from indispensable to unusable to
actively harmful:
https://locusmag.com/2023/11/commentary-by-cory-doctorow-dont-be-evil/
While some services have fallen harder and/or faster, they’re all
falling. When a whole cohort of services all turn sour in the same way,
at the same time, it’s obvious that something is happening systemically.
After all, these companies are still being led by the same people. The
leaders who presided over a period in which these companies made good
and useful services are also presiding over these services’ decay. What
factors are leading to a pandemic of rapid-onset enshittification?
Recall that enshittification is a three-stage process: first surpluses
are allocated to users until they are locked in. Then they are withdrawn
and given to business-customers until they are locked in. Then all the
value is harvested for the company’s shareholders, leaving just enough
residual value in the service to keep both end-users and
business-customers glued to the platform. We can think of each step in
that enshittification process as the outcome of an argument. At some
product planning meeting, one person will propose doing something to
materially worsen the service to the company’s advantage, and at the
expense of end-users or business-customers. Think of Youtube’s decay.
Over the past year, Google has: Dramatically increased the cost of
ad-free Youtube subscriptions; Dramatically increased the number of ads
shown to non-subscribers; Dramatically decreased the amount of money
paid to Youtube creators; Added aggressive anti-adblock; Then, this
week, Google started adding a five-second blanking interval for
non-Chrome users who have adblockers installed:
https://www.404media.co/youtube-says-new-5-second-video-load-delay-is-supposed-to-punish-ad-blockers-not-firefox-users/
These all smack of Jenga blocks that different product managers are
removing in pursuit of their “key performance indicators” (KPIs):
https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/microincentives-and-enshittification/
We can think of each of these steps as the outcome of an argument.
Someone proposes a Youtube subscription price-hike, and other internal
stakeholders object. These objections fall into two categories: We
shouldn’t do this because it will make the product worse; and/or We
shouldn’t do this because it will reduce the company’s earnings. Lots of
googlers sincerely care about product quality. People like doing a good
job, and they take pride in making good things. Many have sacrificed
something that mattered in the service of making the product better.
It’s bad enough to miss your kid’s school play so you can meet a work
deadline – but imagine making that sacrifice and then having the
excellent work you put in deliberately degraded. I have been around
Google’s orbit since its early days, going to the odd company Christmas
party in the early 2000s and giving talks at Google offices in cities
all over the world. I’ve known hundreds of skilled googlers who
passionately cared about making the best products they could. For most
of Google’s history, those googlers won the argument. But they didn’t do
so merely by appealing to their colleagues’ professional pride in a job
well-done. For most of Google’s history, the winning argument was a
combination of “doing this bad thing would make me sad,” and “doing this
bad thing will make Google poorer.” Companies are disciplined by three
forces: I. Competition (the fear of losing business to a rival); II.
Regulation (the fear of legal penalties that would exceed the expected
profits from a given course of action); III. Self-help (the fear that
customers or users will change their behavior, say, by installing an
ad-blocker). The ability of googlers to win enshittification arguments
by appealing to the company’s bottom line was a function of one or more
of these three disciplining factors. The weakening of each of these
factors is the reason that every tech company is sliding into
enshittification at once. For example, when Google contemplates raising
the price of a Youtube subscription, the dissent might say, “Well, this
will reduce viewership and might shift viewers to rivals like Tiktok”
(competition). But the price-hiking side can counter, “No, because we
have a giant archive, we control 90% of searches, we are embedded in the
workflow of vloggers and other creators who automatically stream and
archive to Youtube, and Youtube comes pre-installed on every Android
device.” Even if the company leaks a few viewers to Tiktok, it will
still make more money in aggregate. Prices go up. When Google
contemplates increasing the number of ads shown to nonsubscribers, the
dissent might say, “This will incentivize more users to install
ad-blockers, and then we’ll see no ad-revenue from them.” The pro-ad
side can counter, “No, because most Youtube viewing is in-app, and
reverse-engineering the Youtube app to add an ad-blocker is a felony
under Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. As to
non-app viewers: we control the majority of browser installations and
have Chrome progressively less hospitable to ad-blocking.” When Google
contemplates adding anti-adblock to its web viewers, the dissent might
say, “Processing users’ data in order to ad-block them will violate
Europe’s GDPR.” The anti-adblock side can counter, “But we maintain the
fiction that our EU corporate headquarters is in the corporate
crime-haven of Ireland, where the privacy regulator systematically
underenforces the GDPR. We can expect a very long tenure of anti-adblock
before we are investigated, and we might win the investigation. Even if
we are punished, the expected fine is less than the additional
ad-revenue we stand to make.” When Google contemplates stealing
performers’ wages through opaque reshufflings of its revenue-sharing
system, the dissent might say, “Our best performers have options, they
can go to Twitch or Tiktok.” To which the pro-wage-theft side can
counter, “But they have no way of taking their viewers with them.
There’s no way for them to offer their viewers on Youtube a tool that
alerts them whenever they post a new video to a rival platform. Their
archives are on Youtube, and if they move them to another platform,
there’s no way redirect users searching for those videos to their new
homes. What’s more, any attempt to unilaterally extract their users’
contact info, or redirect searchers or create a multiplatform client,
violates some mix of our terms of service, our rights under DMCA 1201,
etc.” It’s not just Google. For every giant platform, the threats of
competition, regulation and self-help have been in steady decline for
years, as acquisitions, underenforcement of privacy/labor/consumer law,
and an increase in IP protection for incumbents have all mounted:
https://locusmag.com/2020/09/cory-doctorow-ip/ When internal factions at
tech companies argue about whether to make their services worse, there’s
a heavy weight tilting the scales towards enshittification. The lack of
competition, an increase in switching costs for users and
business-customers, and broad powers to prevent users from modifying the
service for themselves all mean that even when a product gets worse,
profits can still go up. This is the culprit: monopoly, and its
handmaiden, regulatory capture. That’s why today’s antimonopoly movement
– and the cases against all the tech giants – are so important. The old,
good internet was built by flawed tech companies whose internal ranks
included the same amoral enshittifiers who are gobbling up the
platforms’ seed corn today. The thing that stood in their way before
wasn’t merely the moral character of colleagues who shrank away from
these cynical maneuvers: it was the economic penalties that befell those
who enshittified too rashly. Incentives matter. Money talks and bullshit
walks. Enshittification isn’t due to the moral failings of individuals
in tech companies. It’s possible to have a good internet run by flawed
people. But to get that new, good internet, we have to support
technologists of good will and character by terrorizing their venal and
cynical colleagues by hitting them where they live: in their paychecks.

<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
From the BBC World Service: The drama continues at artificial
intelligence business OpenAI, where co-founder Sam Altman is set to
return as boss just days after he was fired by the board. And, in the
Netherlands we hear voters’ concerns about inflation as they head to the
polls. Meanwhile, South Korea’s traditional cabbage-based dish, kimchi,
is finding favor beyond Asia. We take a look at the growing global
market.

Manual Authentication to iMessage</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, updated: 2023-11-22, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
Signal has had the ability to manually authenticate another account for
years. iMessage is

it</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The feature is called Contact Key Verification, and it does just what
its name says: it lets you add a manual verification step in an iMessage
conversation to confirm that the other person is who their device says
they are. (SMS conversations lack any reliable method for
verification­—sorry, green-bubble friends.) Instead of relying on Apple
to verify the other person’s identity using information stored securely
on Apple’s servers, you and the other party read a short verification
code to each other, either in person or on a phone call. Once you’ve
validated the conversation, your devices maintain a chain of trust in
which neither you nor the other person has given any private encryption
information to each other or Apple. If anything changes in the
encryption keys each of you verified, the Messages app will notice and
provide an alert or warning…

<h2 id="scanning-the-local-network">Scanning the local network</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Scanning the local network
</h1>
<p>
I have a very old Raspberry Pi 0 that runs a music daemon. Today my
client couldn’t connect to it. And neither can I connect using SSH.
</p>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ssh raspberrypi 
ssh: Could not resolve hostname raspberrypi.local: Name or service not known
</code></pre>
<p>
“raspberrypi” is defined in my config file, <code>~/.ssh/config</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>Host raspberrypi
  HostName raspberrypi.local
  User root
</code></pre>
<p>
Since the music is still playing, I know the machine is up. It’s just
the name that doesn’t work.
</p>
<p>
So now I wanted to know: what machines are there on my local area
network right now?
</p>
<p>
Based on
<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/311019/display-list-of-computers-on-a-lan-in-linux">Display
list of computers on a LAN in Linux</a>, I ran <code>ifconfig</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; ifconfig
…
wlp1s0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.178.48  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.178.255
…
</code></pre>
<p>
(I ran <code>iwconfig</code> to confirm that this is my wireless
interface.)
</p>
<p>
The important part is the IP Number and the netmask. The output above
basically means that my network uses the numbers 192.168.178.0 to
192.168.178.255. Or in CIDR notation: 192.168.178.0/24.
</p>
<p>
As a note to my future self: CIDR notation indicates the number of bits
set in the netmask. There are four bytes in the netmask, each having 8
bits. The first three bytes of the netmask listed are 255, so there are
three bytes with all bits set. The last byte is 0, so no bits are set.
Thus, the first 3×8=24 bits are set, explaining the <code>/24</code>
part. The part in front of the slash are the remaining bytes. In this
case three bytes with all bits set means that I can use the three bytes
of my own address: 192.168.178.48 → 192.168.178.0.
</p>
<p>
So now I’m ready to run <code>nmap</code>:
</p>
<pre><code>alex@melanobombus ~&gt; sudo nmap -sP 192.168.178.0/24
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-22 10:33 CET

<p>
So… which one is it? <code>.1</code> is the router. <code>.26</code> is
the speaker playing the music (the wireless network is useless since
it’s getting the audio signal via a cable from the Raspberry Pi).
<code>.34</code> is the iPad. <code>.48</code> is the laptop, as we
established at the very beginning.
</p>
<p>
In short, it seems as if the Raspberry Pi is no longer online. 💩
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I should switch it out for the Raspberry 4 one of these days.

<p>
Then again, let’s see what the router says? Using the web interface:

<h2 id="us-philippines-conduct-patrols-in-south-china-sea">US,
Philippines Conduct Patrols in South China Sea</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States and the Philippines were conducting joint air and
maritime patrols in the South China Sea, which come as the two countries
step up cooperation in the face of growingly aggressive Chinese activity
in the area.</p>
<p>The Philippine Air Force said on Wednesday its aircraft had taken
part in joint patrols on Tuesday in the vicinity of Batanes, the
northernmost province of the Philippines, which is only about 200
kilometers from Taiwan, a self-governed island that China claims as its
own.</p>
<p>The patrols run through Thursday and include both the U.S. and
Philippine navies.</p>
<p>They come only days after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
Jr. called the situation in the South China Sea increasingly “dire” as
China seeks to assert its presence in an area where multiple nations
have competing territorial claims.</p>
<p>China claims virtually the entire South China Sea as its own waters,
which has led to disputes not only with the Philippines but also with
Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan and Brunei, which have long been regarded as
potential flashpoints in the region and the U.S.-China rivalry.</p>
<p>Earlier this month a Chinese coast guard ship blasted a Philippine
supply ship with a water cannon in disputed waters, and last month a
Chinese coast guard ship and an accompanying vessel rammed a Philippine
coast guard ship and a military-run supply boat near a contested shoal,
according to Philippine officials.</p>
<p>Speaking on Sunday in Honolulu, Marcos said China has been showing
interest in atolls and shoals that are “closer and closer” to the coast
of the Philippines, with the nearest atoll about 111 kilometers
away.</p>
<p>In announcing the start of the joint patrols, Marcos said on X, the
social media platform originally known as Twitter, that they were
“testament to our commitment to bolster the interoperability of our
military forces.”</p>
<p>“Through collaborative efforts, we aim to enhance regional security
and foster a seamless partnership with the United States in safeguarding
our shared interests,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Under Marcos, who was elected last year, the Philippines has been
deepening its relationship with the U.S. in a shift from his
predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who had been closer to China and
Russia.</p>
<p>In February, Marcos approved an expansion of the U.S. military
presence in the Philippines to add four new bases from five existing
sites under a 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the
longtime treaty allies.</p>
<p>The move, which Marcos said would boost the Philippines’ coastal
defense, dovetails with the Biden administration’s efforts to strengthen
an arc of military alliances in the Indo-Pacific to better counter
China.</p>
<p>Marcos has also been strengthening ties with others, including Tokyo,
signing an agreement earlier in the year to allow Japanese troops to
join training exercises.</p>

<h2 id="wieviel-kosmologie-braucht-die-welt">Wieviel Kosmologie braucht
die Welt?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Wieviel Kosmologie braucht die Welt?
</h1>
<p>
Mit der Kosmologie halte ich es wie mit der
<a href="2023-11-19-geschichte">Geschichte</a>. Dort hatte ich gesagt:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Die Geschichte ist nur insofern relevant, als sie als Inspiration für
alte Ruinen und magische Gegenstände dient, auf Buchtiteln und
Inschriften erwähnt wird. Ein genauer Zeitstrahl ist nicht wichtig,
ausser man ist Gelehrter statt Abenteurer.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bei der Kosmologie sind mir die Portal zu anderen Welten, die Monster
aus diesen Welten und die davon inspirierten Zaubersprüche wichtig. Und
die Götter und Dämonen bestimmen natürlich das Aussehen der Tempel und
das Auftreten der Priesterschaft und ihre Zaubersprüche. Von dem her ist
mir klar, dass es eine Welt des Feuers und eine Welt des Eises geben
muss. Und eine Welt der Dunkelheit. Und so weiter.
</p>
<p>
Weil ich Planescape zwar in der Theorie super finde, es aber in der
Praxis aber nicht ganz so toll war, habe ich mich entschieden, weniger
Welten neben der normalen Spielwelt zu haben: die nordische Kosmologie
hat knapp unter zehn Welten, man kennt sie aus Sagen (das
Niebelungenlied, der Ring Zyklus von Wagner, die Marvel Universen, The
Wizard Knight von Gene Wolfe) und so hat man sofort ein paar Bilder zur
Hand, wenn man diese Welten anspielt.
</p>
<p>
Das Hauptproblem bei der Verwendung der nordischen Kosmologie ist der
braune Sumpf, der sich davon angezogen fühlt… So oder so ähnlich hat
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="settembrini">@settembrini</span></a> das
mal ausgedrückt. Deswegen hat Alrik ja
<a href="https://alrik.snafu.zone/wiki/Dimension">eine andere
Kosmologie</a>. Dort war ja auch zu brücksichtigen, dass die
“Dimensionen” zu den Zaubersprüchen und Monstern von Alrik passen müssen
– genau so wie “meine” Kosmologie ja auch zu “meinen” Zaubersprüchen und
Monstern passen muss.
</p>
<p>
Im <a href="/pdfs/Horte.pdf">Horte</a> Traktat sieht das dann etwa so
aus wie unten aufgeführt.
</p>
<h2>
Kosmologie
</h2>
<p>
Es heisst, es gäbe neun Welten, doch nur acht davon sind allgemein
bekannt:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em>Asgard</em>, die Stadt der Götter: blauer Himmel, Sonnenschein,
ewiger Mittag, goldene Hallen, eine Insel in der Astralsee, eine
Regenbogenbrücke, welche den Göttern Zutritt zu den anderen Welten
erlaubt
</li>
<li>
<em>Alfheim</em>, das Reich der Elfen: blauer Himmel, ewig goldenes
Licht, riesige Bäume, glitzernde Städte, farbige Blumen und wilde Tiere
</li>
<li>
<em>Midgard</em>, das Reich der Menschen: blauer Himmel, rote
Sonnenuntergänge, Berge, Wälder, Ebenen, Wüsten, Flüsse, Seen, Meere –
die Welt, die wir kennen
</li>
<li>
<em>Myrkheim</em>, das Reich der Zwerge: dunkle Höhlen, Feuerschalen,
Minen, Goblins, Molche, Spinnen, Pilze, giftige Dämpfe, tiefen Spalten
</li>
<li>
<em>Jötunheim</em>, das Reich der Riesen: ewige Nacht, strahlender
Vollmond, Wolken, Schatten, Gletscher, Berge, gefrorene Flüsse, Packeis
und ein Ozean voller Eisberge

<h2 id="dead-3-missing-after-alaska-landslide">3 Dead, 3 Missing After
Alaska Landslide</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Three people were killed and three were missing after a landslide
barreled down a heavily forested, rain-soaked mountainside and smashed
into homes in a remote fishing community in southeast Alaska.</p>
<p>The slide — estimated to be 137 meters wide — occurred at about 9
p.m. Monday during a significant rain and windstorm near Wrangell, an
island community of 2,000 people some 250 kilometers south of the state
capital of Juneau.</p>
<p>Rescue crews found the body of a girl in an initial search and late
Tuesday the bodies of two adults were found by a drone operator.
Searchers used a cadaver-sniffing dog and heat-sensing drones to search
for two children and one adult unaccounted for after the disaster, while
the Coast Guard and other vessels looked along a waterfront littered
with rocks, trees and mud.</p>
<p>Alaska State Troopers spokesperson Austin McDaniel said a woman who
had been on the upper floor of a home was rescued. She was in good
condition and receiving medical care. One of the three homes that was
struck was unoccupied, McDaniel said.</p>
<p>“Our community is resilient,” Wrangell interim borough manager Mason
Villarma told The Associated Press in a phone interview. “And it always
comes together for tragedies like this. We’re broken, but resilient and
determined to find everybody that’s missing.”</p>
<p>Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a disaster declaration for Wrangell, saying
he and his wife were heartbroken and praying for all those affected.</p>
<p>The landslide left a scar of barren earth from near the top of the
mountain down to the ocean. A wide swath of evergreen trees was ripped
out of the ground and a highway was buried by debris, cutting off access
and power to approximately 75 homes.</p>
<p>Troopers said a large-scale search and rescue mission wasn’t
initially possible because the site was unstable and hazardous. A
geologist from the state transportation department was flown in from
Juneau and conducted a preliminary assessment, clearing some areas of
the debris field for ground searches.</p>
<p>Troopers warned of the threat of additional landslides. They urged
people caught on the other side of the slide, away from Wrangell, to
evacuate by water taxi.</p>
<p>Wrangell received about 5 centimeters of rain between 1 a.m. and 8
p.m. Monday, with wind gusts up to 96 kph at higher elevations, said
Aaron Jacobs, a hydrologist and meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Juneau.</p>
<p>It was part of a strong storm system that moved through southeast
Alaska, bringing heavy snow in places and blizzard-like conditions to
Juneau and rainfall with minor flooding to areas farther south.
Landslides also were reported in the Ketchikan area and on Prince of
Wales Island, he said.</p>
<p>Rainfall amounts like what Wrangell received Monday are not unusual,
Jacobs said, but strong winds could have helped trigger the slide.
Saturated soil can give way when gusts blow trees on a slope, said
Barrett Salisbury, a geologist with the Alaska Department of Natural
Resources.</p>
<p>Another storm system is expected in the Wrangell area late Wednesday
into Thursday.</p>
<p>Wrangell is one of the oldest non-Alaska Native settlements in the
state, founded in 1811 when Russians began trading with Tlingits,
according to a state database of Alaska communities. Tlingits, Russians,
the British and Americans all accounted for historical influences on
Wrangell. Timber once was a major economic driver, but that has shifted
to commercial fishing.</p>
<p>In December 2020, torrential rains prompted a landslide in another
southeast Alaska city, claiming two lives. The 183-meter-wide slide
slammed into a neighborhood in the community of Haines, leaving about
2.7 meters of mud and trees covering city streets.</p>

<h2 id="americans-split-on-aid-to-ukraine">Americans Split on Aid to
Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>As lawmakers in Washington weigh sending billions more in federal
support to Kyiv to help fight off Russian aggression, close to half of
the U.S. public thinks the country is spending too much on aid to
Ukraine, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for
Public Affairs Research.</p>
<p>Those sentiments, driven primarily by Republicans, help explain the
hardening opposition among conservative GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill
who are rebuffing efforts from President Joe Biden to approve a new
tranche of Ukraine aid, arguing that the money would be better spent for
domestic priorities.</p>
<p>Yet opposition to aid is down slightly from where it was a month ago
in another AP-NORC poll. Now, 45% say the U.S. government is spending
too much on aid to Ukraine in the war against Russia, compared with 52%
in October. That shift appears to come mostly from Republicans: 59% now
say too much is spent on Ukraine aid, but that’s down from 69% in
October.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Republican resistance to continued Ukraine aid
remains strong.</p>
<p>“I understand the citizens need help, but I feel like we’re spending
way too much money on Ukraine when we have our issues here, on our own
soil, that we need to deal with,” said Eric Mondello, 40, from Fountain,
Colorado. Pointing to needs such as health care for veterans and
homelessness in communities, Mondello added, “I understand the U.S. has
been an ally to others, but I feel like, let’s take care of our people
first.”</p>
<p>More than one-third (38%) of U.S. adults says that current spending
is “about the right amount,” which is up slightly from last month (31%).
Among Republicans, nearly 3 in 10 (29%) say the current spending is
about right, up from 20% last month.</p>
<p>Paula Graves, 69, is among those who say the amount of spending for
Ukraine is the right amount.</p>
<p>“Putin, he’s straight up evil. I don’t think there should be any
question in anyone’s mind,” said Graves, of Clovis, California. “He’s a
dictator. He’s infringed on human rights, he’s a very scary person and
if Ukraine falls to him, who’s next? What country’s next?”</p>
<p>Graves, who says she is not affiliated with a political party but
leans more conservative, said she believes the U.S. has a leadership
role on the global stage, adding, “I think we definitely need to put
America first, but I don’t think that needs to be first and only.”</p>
<p>The White House has been repeatedly pressing lawmakers to pass
Biden’s nearly $106 billion emergency spending package that he proposed
in October. It includes more than $61 billion specifically for the war
in Ukraine. The rest of Biden’s request has aid for Israel as it battles
Hamas, money for various priorities in the Indo-Pacific region and
additional resources to help manage migration at the southern
border.</p>
<p>On Ukraine, the Biden administration is increasingly warning that the
well of aid is running dry. In an unannounced visit to Kyiv on Monday,
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Ukraine’s effort to defeat Russian
forces “matters to the rest of the world” and pledged that U.S. support
would continue “for the long haul.”</p>
<p>That message was reinforced at the White House.</p>
<p>“As President Biden has said, when aggressors don’t pay a price for
their aggression, they’ll cause more chaos and death and destruction,”
John Kirby, spokesman for the National Security Council, told the White
House press briefing Monday. “They just keep on going, and the cost and
the threats to America and to the world will keep rising.”</p>
<p>But Congress has rebuffed the White House efforts at bolstering
Ukraine support at least twice in recent months. First, it ignored a
roughly $40 billion supplemental request before a Sept. 30 funding
deadline. Then last week, it passed a stopgap funding measure that keeps
the government operating through early next year, but with no additional
Ukraine aid.</p>
<p>In the Senate, a small bipartisan group is working on legislation
that would combine fresh Ukraine assistance with stricter border
measures to address concerns from Republicans that the U.S. was focused
on needs abroad at the expense of issues closer to home. A broad
majority of senators remains supportive of Ukraine aid, with Senate
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., being one of the most stalwart
supporters despite the isolationist strain in his party.</p>
<p>South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate,
said lawmakers will continue to work on the Ukraine-border package over
the Thanksgiving break and won’t wait until mid-January — when Congress
faces another government funding deadline — to act on Ukraine.</p>
<p>The big question mark is in the House, where still-new Speaker Mike
Johnson — who had voted against Ukraine aid as a rank-and-file
conservative — has spoken broadly of the need to counter Russian
aggression yet faces unruly GOP lawmakers who have shown more hostility
to continued support for Kyiv.</p>
<p>Johnson, too, is insisting that additional Ukraine aid be paired with
tougher border measures, although it is far from certain that any
immigration agreement that clears the Democratic-led Senate could pass
the GOP-controlled House.</p>
<p>Half of U.S. adults are extremely or very concerned that Russia’s
influence poses a direct threat to the United States. Democrats (53%)
and Republicans (51%) are similarly concerned about Russian power – but
Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see Ukraine as a nation of
shared values to the U.S. and to support more aid for Ukraine.</p>
<p>About half of the public (48%) endorses providing weapons to Ukraine
(57% among Democrats, 42% among Republicans). About 4 in 10 favor
sending government funds directly to Ukraine (54% for Democrats, 24% for
Republicans).</p>
<p>Americans have grown slightly more likely to say the U.S. should take
“a less active role” in solving the world’s problems, compared with a
September poll from AP-NORC and Pearson. Slightly fewer than half (45%)
now says the U.S. should be less involved, up from 33% in September.
Just 16% of Democrats now say the U.S. should take a more active role,
down from 29% in September.</p>
<p>Peter Einsig, a Republican from Tulsa, Oklahoma, said he still
believes the U.S. has a role to play abroad, but that he remains
concerned about excessive government spending and federal debt.</p>
<p>Yet Einsig said he would be more inclined to support aid to Ukraine
if there were more oversight into how the money was being used abroad,
as well as a timeline of how much longer the U.S. would be providing
support.</p>
<p>“We don’t have transparency on where the money is really, really
going,” said Einsig, 40. “It’s a big lump sum.”</p>
<p>Four in 10 U.S. adults say Ukraine is an ally that shares U.S.
interests and values. That view is most common among Democrats (53%),
who are much more likely than independents (28%), Republicans (29%) and
Americans overall to see Ukraine as a nation with similar values and
needs. About half of Republicans say Ukraine is a partner that the U.S.
should cooperate with, but say it is not a nation that shares U.S.
values.</p>

<h2 id="world-remembers-kennedy-60-years-after-assassination">World
Remembers Kennedy 60 Years After Assassination</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Wednesday will mark 60 years since the fateful day in Dallas in 1963
when U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.</p>
<p>Despite having one of the shortest tenures of any U.S president, the
youthful Kennedy - along with his wife Jacqueline - forever changed the
office of the U.S. presidency.</p>
<p>The Kennedy administration challenged post-war America to rise to the
challenge of new opportunities and innovations. At his inauguration in
January 1961, Kennedy declared: “Ask not what your country can do for
you. Ask what you can do for your country.”</p>
<p>Kennedy followed that months later, in a speech before a joint
session of Congress, by setting the goal of landing a man on the moon
within a decade.</p>
<p>It was the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and Kennedy
used all of the tools at his disposal to emphasize the power and
persuasion of the U.S. in diplomatic trips around the world. He joked
that he was the “man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy” to Paris and
inspired the crowds in West Berlin with the phrase “Ich bin ein
Berliner!”</p>
<p>Kennedy also guided the country through the threat of nuclear war
during the Cuban missile crisis in the autumn of 1962.</p>
<p>However, it was Kennedy’s shocking death that forever stamped his
life and legacy onto the world’s memory.</p>
<p>In November 1963, the 46-year-old Kennedy arrived in Texas for a
two-day, five-city trip to help raise campaign funds for his re-election
the following year and to increase political support for his ticket with
Vice President Lyndon Johnson, a native Texan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After starting his second day in Texas at nearby Ft. Worth, Kennedy
and his wife flew to Dallas, where they met the vice president and Texas
Governor John Connally and their spouses. Shortly before noon, the
presidential motorcade, with Kennedy and Connally in the second vehicle,
left the airfield to drive through the downtown area of the city to the
Dallas Business and Trade Mart for a speech and luncheon.</p>
<p>The cars moved along streets lined with cheering crowds and at around
12:30 p.m. local time turned from Main Street onto Elm Street in front
of the Texas School Book Depository at Dealey Plaza. Moments later,
shots rang out and both President Kennedy and Governor Connally were
struck by bullets.</p>
<p>Kennedy was hit in the neck and head, while Connally suffered a wound
to the chest. The limousine sped away under escort to nearby Parkland
Memorial Hospital where little could be done for the mortally-wounded
U.S. president. A Catholic priest was summoned to give him the last
rites. Governor Connally, though seriously wounded, would recover from
his injuries after emergency surgery.</p>
<p>As live radio reports described the scene, the infant television news
programs of the major networks ABC, CBS and NBC cut into their
programming to bring the tragic news to the American people.</p>
<p>Kennedy’s body was returned to Air Force One, where before takeoff,
Vice President Johnson was sworn in as the 36th president of the United
States.</p>
<p>After returning to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington,
President Johnson tried to console the country that Friday evening.</p>
<p>On Sunday, November 24, in a solemn procession, Kennedy’s casket was
taken by horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol building where it lay in
state at the Rotunda. An estimated 250,000 people filed past to pay
their respects. The official funeral was held on Monday, November 25, as
heads of state and dignitaries from more than 100 countries attended the
formal ceremony at St. Matthew’s Cathedral.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the more emotional moments forever captured on film and
pictures was JFK’s youngest child, 3-year-old John F. Kennedy, Jr. -
known as “John John” - saluting his father’s casket as it went past the
family.</p>
<p>Back in Dallas, police arrested Lee Harvey Oswald, a recently-hired
employee of the Texas Book Depository and a former U.S. Marine. On
Sunday, November 24, when police were transferring Oswald from police
headquarters to county jail, Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby shot him
at point-blank range on live television, and Oswald died two hours
later.</p>
<p>President Johnson appointed the Commission on the Assassination of
President Kennedy to be chaired by Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the
United States, to investigate the assassination and the subsequent
killing of the alleged assassin. The 889-page final report was delivered
to Johnson in September of 1964.</p>
<p>The Warren Commission concluded that Oswald acted alone when he fired
the three rifle shots that killed President Kennedy and wounded Governor
Connally. It also concluded that Ruby acted alone when he shot Oswald
two days later. Despite abundant conspiracy theories and studies that
challenge these results, the findings, though controversial, remain the
official government position on President Kennedy’s death.</p>

<p>There’s a flaw in the design of our social networks. The idea that
there are “conversations” when actually many of the replies you get are
spam. People trying to attach their name to something that they hope
gets them attention and followers. So when someone addresses something
to you it can be confusing, because they aren’t actually talking to you,
they’re talking to the imagined thousands of people over your shoulder
looking for some new tweeter or tooter or threader to adore. When it’s
actually mostly people looking for places to hang their own spam to
catch other people’s attention and followers. Is there anything actually
going on there? Sadly, no.</p>

id="biden-highlights-efforts-with-china-mexico-to-combat-fentanyl-1">Biden
Highlights Efforts with China, Mexico to Combat Fentanyl</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden highlighted “strong international
coordination” by his administration to halt the flow of fentanyl and the
ingredients used to produce the deadly drug following his diplomatic
engagements with leaders of China and Mexico last week.</p>
<p>“We’ve focused on prevention, harm reduction, treatment and
recovery,” he said on Tuesday during a meeting at the White House to
address the scourge of the illicit drug that has killed more than
200,000 Americans in recent years. “But this challenge also has roots
outside our borders, outside the borders of the United States.”</p>
<p>Biden vowed to accelerate his administration’s efforts to combat the
drug following counternarcotics deals with Beijing and Mexico City
reached last week on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Fentanyl is mass-produced in Mexico using precursor chemicals largely
from China and trafficked via cartels into the U.S.</p>
<p>“It’s a global challenge that demands global action,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Following their meeting, Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping
announced the resumption of bilateral cooperation on counternarcotics to
reduce the flow of precursor chemicals that fuel fentanyl.</p>
<p>“It’s a big step forward, and we’re grateful for that,” said John
Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for strategic
communications, during a briefing for reporters on Tuesday. “It may be
some time before you see the practical results.”</p>
<p>With Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Biden agreed to
expand law enforcement cooperation and intelligence sharing to restrict
trafficking of the drug.</p>
<p>The administration has been under pressure to take tougher measures
to stop fentanyl from coming into the country. Republican lawmakers
regularly highlight the smuggling of fentanyl as a reason to fortify the
U.S.-Mexico border. Several Republican candidates say they would use
military force against Mexican cartels in response to the trafficking of
fentanyl and other synthetic opioids.</p>
<p>Republicans also accuse Biden of being soft on China’s role in the
epidemic.</p>
<p>“Communist China’s actions have told us that they choose to be our
enemy. Fentanyl produced in China has killed thousands of Americans,”
Republican Senator Rick Scott said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ineffective track record</p>
<p>China can control the flow of precursor chemicals in ways that Latin
American governments cannot, but whether Beijing will invest in the
effort remains to be seen, said Peter Reuter, professor in the School of
Public Policy and the Department of Criminology at the University of
Maryland.</p>
<p>Past efforts to control production and exports from outside the
country have proved ineffective, he said.</p>
<p>“We always worry about displacement,” Reuter told VOA. “That is that
if China stops sending the precursors, that the very large, poorly
regulated, corruptly regulated, Indian industry will replace China.”</p>
<p>Illegal fentanyl is often produced in clandestine laboratories using
precursors and fentanyl analogs produced by legitimate chemical and
pharmaceutical companies that are not domestically or internationally
regulated.</p>
<p>A heavy focus on supply-based strategies to limit their entry from
abroad can be counterproductive to the positive steps in harm reduction
that the administration has taken as traffickers find workarounds to
avoid breaking the law, said Brandon Marshall, professor of epidemiology
at the Brown University School of Public Health.</p>
<p>“Many of these efforts to restrict the supply lead traffickers to
identify substances which are more potent,” he told VOA. “That’s what we
see play over and over again.”</p>
<p>Biden urged lawmakers to approve more funds to support Americans with
substance abuse disorders and close existing loopholes for small
shipments of the drug, which can go undetected in border crossings and
even through the postal system.</p>
<p>“I also urge Congress to permanently make fentanyl and related
substances as Schedule One drugs,” he said.</p>
<p>Such a move means that drug users would be even more stigmatized and
move them further away from the help that they need, said Mary Sylla,
director of Overdose Prevention Policy and Strategy at the National Harm
Reduction Coalition, an advocacy group for the rights of people who use
drugs.</p>
<p>That puts people into a prison system that actually increases the
likelihood of overdose, she told VOA.</p>
<p>Sylla argued that more focus and resources should be placed instead
on efforts to reduce the negative impacts of substance use, including
syringe services, overdose prevention and drug treatment for those who
are interested.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Trump administration placed a temporary class-wide
emergency scheduling of fentanyl-related substances, chemicals that are
similar in structure to fentanyl as used in clinical/hospital settings.
The emergency ban has been extended by Congress several times.</p>
<p>The ban may have unintended and negative impacts, including making
research on these substances much more difficult, Marshall said.</p>
<p>In 2021, a group of more than 100 organizations wrote a letter urging
Congress and the Biden administration to allow the emergency scheduling
to expire, arguing that the scheduling exacerbates pretrial detention,
mass incarceration and racial disparities in the prison system.</p>
<p>“As we approach the 50-year milestone of President Nixon’s
announcement of the War on Drugs, there is ample evidence that these
unscientific policies destroy communities, entrench racial disparities,
and do nothing to reduce drug supply or demand,” the letter said.</p>

id="largest-crypto-exchange-fined-4-billion-ceo-pleads-guilty-to-allowing-money-laundering">Largest
Crypto Exchange Fined $4 Billion; CEO Pleads Guilty to Allowing Money
Laundering</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. government dealt a massive blow to Binance, the world’s
largest cryptocurrency exchange, which agreed to pay a roughly $4
billion settlement Tuesday as its founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao pleaded
guilty to a felony related to his failure to prevent money laundering on
the platform. </p>
<p>Zhao stepped down as the company’s chief executive, and Binance
admitted to violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and apparent violations
of sanctions programs, including its failure to implement reporting
programs for suspicious transactions. </p>
<p>“Using new technology to break the law does not make you a disruptor,
it makes you a criminal,” said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland,
who called the settlement one of the largest corporate penalties in the
nation’s history. </p>
<p>As part of the settlement agreement, the U.S. Treasury said Binance
will be subject to five years of monitoring and “significant compliance
undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the
United States.” Binance is a Cayman Islands limited liability
company. </p>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry has been marred by scandals and market
meltdowns. </p>
<p>Rival of FTX founder</p>
<p>Zhao was perhaps best known as the chief rival to Sam Bankman-Fried,
the 31-year-old founder of FTX, which was the second-largest crypto
exchange before it collapsed last November. Bankman-Fried was convicted
earlier this month of fraud for stealing at least $10 billion from
customers and investors. </p>
<p>Zhao, meanwhile, pleaded guilty in a federal court in Seattle on
Tuesday to one count of failure to maintain an effective
anti-money-laundering program. </p>
<p>Magistrate Judge Brian A. Tsuchida questioned Zhao to make sure he
understood the plea agreement, saying at one point: “You knew you didn’t
have controls in place.” </p>
<p>“Yes, your honor,” he replied. </p>
<p>Binance wrote in a statement that it made “misguided decisions” as it
quickly grew to become the world’s biggest crypto exchange, and said the
settlement acknowledges its “responsibility for historical, criminal
compliance violations.” </p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Binance processed
transitions by illicit actors, “supporting activities from child sexual
abuse to illegal narcotics, to terrorism, across more than 100,000
transactions.” </p>
<p>Binance did not file a single suspicious activity report on those
transactions, Yellen said, and the company allowed more than 1.5 million
virtual currency trades that violated U.S. sanctions, including ones
involving Hamas’ al-Qassam Brigades, al-Qaida and other criminals. </p>
<p>The judge set Zhao’s sentencing for February 23, however it’s likely
to be delayed. He faces a possible guideline sentence range of up to 18
months. </p>
<p>One of his attorneys, Mark Bartlett, noted that Zhao had been aware
of the investigation since December 2020, and surrendered willingly even
though the United Arab Emirates — where Zhao lives — has no extradition
treaty with the U.S. </p>
<p>“He decided to come here and face the consequences,” Bartlett said.
“He’s sitting here. He pled guilty.” </p>
<p>Zhao, who is married and has young children in the UAE, promised he
would return to the U.S. for sentencing if allowed to stay there in the
meantime. </p>
<p>“I want to take responsibility and close this chapter in my life,”
Zhao said. “I want to come back. Otherwise I wouldn’t be here
today.” </p>
<p>Company sent investor assets to third party</p>
<p>Zhao previously faced allegations of diverting customer funds,
concealing the fact that the company was commingling billions of dollars
in investor assets and sending them to a third party that Zhao also
owned. </p>
<p>Over the summer, Binance was accused of operating as an unregistered
securities exchange and violating a slew of U.S. securities laws in a
lawsuit from regulators. That case was similar to practices uncovered
after the collapse of FTX. </p>
<p>Zhao and Bankman-Fried were originally friendly competitors in the
industry, with Binance investing in FTX when Bankman-Fried launched the
exchange in 2019. However, the relationship between the two
deteriorated, culminating in Zhao announcing he was selling all of his
cryptocurrency investments in FTX in early November 2022. FTX filed for
bankruptcy a week later. </p>
<p>At this trial and in later public statements, Bankman-Fried tried
cast blame on Binance and Zhao for allegedly orchestrating a run on the
bank at FTX. </p>
<p>A jury found Bankman-Fried guilty of wire fraud and several other
charges. He is expected to be sentenced in March, where he could face
decades in prison.</p>

<p>Jason Scott posted the source code for all the Infocom games in 2019.
This was pretty awesome. Everybody who is interested in that stuff
cheered, and now it’s part of the common knowledge of Infocom. If you’re
researching the history of those games, or want to study their design,
you can dig in. So the game source was big news. Infocom’s interpreter
source, however, remained obscure. This was the game-playing software
for each platform: the Apple 2 interpreter, the Commodore 64
interpreter, and so on. A particular Infocom game release (“Zork 3 for
the C64”, say) was a floppy containing the C64 interpreter and the
Zork-3 game file. Boot the floppy, the interpreter starts up; it loads
the game data and the game begins. The code for the interpreter,
however, was never released as open source – until now. Andrew Plotkin
posted all of the code on Github, followed later by an additional code
dump by David Fillmore.</p>

<p>There has been quite a bit of documentation about exploiting the
CANON Printer firmware in the past. For some more background information
I suggest reading these posts by SYNACKTIV, doar-e and DEVCORE. I highly
recommend reading all of it if you want to learn more about hacking
(CANON) Printers. The TL;DR is: We’re dealing with a Custom RTOS called
DRYOS engineered by CANON that doesn’t ship with any modern mitigations
like W^X or ASLR. That means that after getting a bit acquainted with
this alien RTOS it is relatively easy to write (reliable) exploits for
it. Having a custom operating system doesn’t mean it’s more secure than
popular solutions.</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>EE Journal reports: National Instruments (NI) recently released a new
version of its LabView test automation programming environment for the
latest Apple Macintosh computers based on the Arm-based Apple M1 CPU/GPU
SoC. At the same time, NI let its customers know that this release would
be the last one for Apple Macintosh computers, sending a shock through
some portion of the company’s customer base. LabView’s importance to
test and measurement cannot be overstated. It was the first graphical
programming language designed exclusively for test systems. The language
has been continually expanded and improved for nearly 40 years and
features more than 7000 software drivers for instruments from many
vendors as well as support for custom, FPGA-based instruments. LabView
supports many instrument interfaces starting with IEEE-488 and extending
to MXI, PXI, USB, Ethernet, and probably a few more interfaces that
don’t immediately come to mind. It’s a shock to many and will likely
punish higher education students and a chunk of the scientific and
research segment which is still Mac dominant.</p>

Adams Just Cut the Only NYC Compost Programs That Ever Worked</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDUyMzEzOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyODY3OTk5Nn0.Ncx4Y1Xl6NTcxCz-NKzO71HJ504U6zMddpsSUbsF6rM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
For the past 30 years, New York City has funded community-based programs
that spread the gospel of compost. What started as a few education and
outreach sites at the city’s botanical gardens has grown into a vast
network of more than 200 neighborhood food scrap drop-off locations
where devoted New Yorkers enthusiastically deliver bags of rotting waste
each week. Today, the programs employ 115 people and divert more than
8.3 million pounds of organic waste from landfills each year.
</p>
<p>
Now, with the stroke of Mayor Eric Adams’s pen, they will likely have to
shut down.
</p>
<p>
Adams eliminated all funding for community composting, totalling $15
million over the next four years, in a
<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/875-23/mayor-adams-releases-november-2023-financial-plan-update" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">round
of budget cuts</a> announced last week that are meant to offset the
rising cost of aid to migrant asylum seekers. This comes in spite of the
fact that the city’s publicly run — and much more expensive — curbside
composting program is still not fully functional more than a decade in.
</p>
<p>
“It feels very dire right now,” Christine Datz-Romero, the co-founder
and executive director of one of the oldest community compost groups,
the Lower East Side Ecology Center, told me.
</p>
<p>
Adams’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
</p>
<p>
Few services have escaped the strain caused by the
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/nyc-migrant-crisis-explained.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-ny-migrants&variant=show®ion=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">flood
of asylum-seekers</a> fleeing poverty, violence, authoritarian
governments, and
<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/home/downloads/pdf/press-releases/2023/asylum-seeker-blueprint.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">climate
change</a>. In September, Adams asked all city agencies to prepare to
cut their annual budgets by at least 5% to address a projected $7
billion fiscal shortfall. The plan released last week shows the
Department of Education losing about $1 billion over the next two years,
which
<a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/newyork/2023/11/16/nyc-education-department-loses-547-million-in-eric-adams-cuts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">threatens
the city’s free preschool program</a> and will eliminate hundreds of
non-classroom positions. Cuts to library budgets will force many
locations to reduce their hours.
</p>
<p>
Community composting organizations knew budget cuts were coming. They
were already bracing for a decline in funding because of the city’s
plans to scale up the Department of Sanitation’s curbside organic waste
collection program, which picks up food scraps right at people’s
doorsteps, similar to recycling.
</p>
<p>
“We built all the support for it,” Justin Green, the executive director
of Big Reuse, told me. “Now that the city is rolling out curbside, to be
cut without warning is pretty galling.” Even that rollout is no longer
assured — a planned expansion to Staten Island and the Bronx will now be
delayed until next October. Originally budgeted for around $24 million a
year, the curbside program saw its budget slashed by $4.8 million
between now and 2025.
</p>
<p>
Curbside composting has been a holy grail for New York mayors since
Michael Bloomberg, but has long remained mired in the bureaucratic
swamps. Former Mayor Bill DeBlasio managed to get a voluntary program
off the ground in 2013, but it was criticized for poor management and
only serving wealthier neighborhoods, and participation was
<a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/09/04/de-blasios-lofty-organics-goal-stalled-by-lack-of-funding-participation-591124" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notoriously
low</a>. In 2020, the service fell victim to the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
On the campaign trail in 2021, Adams vowed to bring curbside collection
back as a way to cut emissions and solve the city’s rat problem, and in
February announced plans to relaunch voluntary curbside pickup in every
borough. (For now it’s available in Brooklyn and Queens, plus parts of
Manhattan and the Bronx.) The city council then went a step further,
passing an ambitious
<a href="https://www.wastedive.com/news/new-york-city-mandatory-organics-collection-law-eric-adams/685977/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">zero-waste
package</a> in June that will make food waste separation mandatory as
curbside collection grows.
</p>
<p>
Organic waste is the city’s third largest source of greenhouse gas
emissions after buildings and transportation, producing about 20% of New
York’s total climate pollution. Composting doesn’t fully eliminate food
waste emissions, but it has the potential to reduce them by up to 84%,
according to a
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34174-z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recent
study</a>.
</p>
<p>
It’s unclear how much real composting the curbside program will do.
Currently, most of the organics picked up by the sanitation department
go to wastewater treatment facilities in New Jersey and Brooklyn, where
the scraps are mixed with sewage and put through an anaerobic digester.
The process breaks down the solid material and separates out methane
gas, which is then injected into gas pipelines and carried into people’s
homes. Or at least, that’s the idea — a few weeks ago,
<em>Gothamist</em> reported that the system was undergoing maintenance
and the
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/project-to-convert-nyc-compost-to-heating-fuel-goes-offline-weeks-after-launching" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gas
was being burned off</a> on site.
</p>
<p>
Datz-Romero hopes the city will eventually invest in real utility-scale
composting facilities. It’s a chicken and egg problem — the wastewater
treatment facility is already there and has capacity to manage the
waste, and the city can’t justify spending millions on its own site
until there’s robust public participation in food waste separation.
</p>
<p>
“What do you create first, the infrastructure or the need for
infrastructure?” Datz-Romero said. During the DeBlasio administration,
the city was shipping organic waste to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/magazine/the-compost-king-of-new-york.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">private
processing facilities</a>. It did build one large composting facility on
Staten Island, but that has limited capacity.
</p>
<p>
Low participation is one reason community composters say they still have
a crucial outreach role to play, even as curbside pickup expands. They
are in communities every day talking to people about food waste,
teaching them about composting, and bringing tangible benefits like soil
restoration to their parks and street trees.
</p>
<p>
“People can actually engage with that, and they can also understand on a
whole other level why separating food scraps out is so important,” said
Datz-Romero. “Even if composting is mandatory tomorrow, people are not
going to wake up and say, ‘Oh yeah, that’s what I always wanted to do —
separate my banana peels.’”
</p>
<p style>
Green and Datz-Romero said they will have to lay off the staff that run
their food scrap pick-up sites and outreach and education programs.
Though they do get some funding from foundations, Green said that
without the support of the city, those other sources could dry up.
</p>
<p>
The coalition of community composting groups started a
<a href="https://www.grownyc.org/petition" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">petition</a>
urging the mayor and city council to reverse the decision. At time of
publishing, it had more than 20,000 signatures.
</p>
<p>
Community composting might not be making a significant dent in carbon
emissions, Green told me. But it has helped people feel empowered to do
something about climate change.
</p>
<p style>
“People are hungry for things that they can do together as a community.
This is one step that they could do to be like, ‘Okay, I’m taking my
compost to the farmers market, and I can volunteer to apply the compost
to street trees in my neighborhood.’ I think that was valuable. When
people are feeling so much hopelessness around climate, it gives them
something active to do.”

On July 14, thousands of people had no clear picture of the future of
their careers as writers and actors went on strike. Nov. 9 provided hope
as the historic almost-four-month strike ended.  The end of the strike
has not given an immediate snapback for all those affected and does not
erase the monthslong period […]

<p>ChatGPT was overloaded earlier this evening. I wrote: “I’m losing my
shit here. I feel as lost without it as I would have felt last year
without Google. Anyway here’s the question I need answered. ‘working in
javascript in the browser, a question about using localstorage. are
there any rules about how much storage you can use? would 10MB be too
much? 50MB?’” Believe it or not my friend ChatGPT will have some advice
about that and it’ll be pretty good. You can’t find that through a
search engine, btw, which is why OpenAI is so important.</p>

<h2 id="on-creating-beautiful-things">On creating beautiful things</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<p>
As humans, we’re surrounded by objects. We pay very little attention to
the vast majority of them but they’re there, they’re all around us.
Dieter Rams famously said that <em>“Good design is as little design as
possible”</em> and he’s not wrong. Good design is design that does its
job without getting in your way. But good design can—and sometimes
should—also stand out because good design is the embodiment of passion,
of caring for a craft, of loving the process.
</p>
<p>
And that’s precisely why I love everything
<a href="https://craigmod.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Craig
Mod</a> does. I think I first stumbled on his work almost a decade ago
at this point and what really caught my attention was the love for the
process. From the newsletters to the essays to the books, everything is
deliberate and you can just see that he just cares. The feeling I get is
that there’s almost a sense of responsibility when putting something out
into the world and that’s something I can relate to.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
Back in late 2016 I backed the
<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/craigmod/koya-bound-a-book-of-photography-from-japans-kuman" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Koya
Bound</a> on Kickstarter and got my signed and numbered (513) copy.

I loved it. I still love it. I have to admit that what Craig makes lives
at the intersection of way too many things I personally love and am
passionate about: photography, nature, Japan and its culture, and walks.
I’m also a sucker for signed books and limited editions which is why in
2020 I got my copy—number 429—of
<a href="https://shop.specialprojects.jp/products/kissa-by-kissa-5th-ed" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Kissa

<p>
Kissa is, by far, one of my favorite books. And when I say book I mean
both in terms of content and in terms of the actual book. The cover, the
materials, the print, the typeface, the size, the layout. I love
everything about the book and I am so happy I got my first edition.
</p>
<p>
Those two books, and everything else Craig does, are the reasons why it
took me literally 1 minute from receiving the email to hitting the buy
button and get a signed copy of his new book,

In Craig’s words:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Things Become Other Things (TBOT)” is a book chronicling a decade of
walking central Japan’s Kii Peninsula and its Kumano Kodō paths. I’ve
walked thousands of kilometers and talked with hundreds of people. This
is a book about farmers and fishermen and kissa owners and adopted inn
proprietors, about okonomiyaki ladies, whispering priests, and
foul-mouthed little kids. It’s about the loss of industry — lumber,
fishing — and what it does to a place. It’s about depopulation and aging
populations. It’s a reflection on why I emigrated to Japan some 23 years
ago. And it’s a remembrance of the life of one lost friend.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>
Mostly, it’s a book celebrating grace, and documents my searching for
archetypes in landscapes and people — archetypes for how grace can and
should infuse everything, even things coming to an end. Even things
becoming other things.
</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>
I’m aware it’s probably silly, but I want more beautiful objects in this
world. Objects made with love, with care. So thank you Craig for making
these books and for caring so much about what you do.

id="austin-ukraine-fight-has-implications-across-europe-asia-as-china-watches-western-resolve">Austin:
Ukraine Fight Has Implications Across Europe, Asia as China Watches
Western Resolve</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin is warning that if Russia is
successful in Ukraine, China will be emboldened to use military force to
expand its territory in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>“We can’t live in that kind of world,” Austin told U.S. troops at a
military installation in eastern Poland Tuesday after a surprise stop
the day before in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.</p>
<p>“If you’re another autocrat, say China, and you want to take over
more ground [and] more territory, and you saw what happened in Ukraine
and there were no consequences to be paid, you’d feel pretty good about
it,” Austin said.</p>
<p>Austin also warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin will
continue his push to overrun sovereign democracies in eastern Europe if
he isn’t shut down in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Putin won’t stop if he takes Ukraine,” Austin said. “The next thing
is he’s rolling across the Baltics … and the next thing you know, you
and your comrades will be on the frontlines fighting against a Putin
that we should have stopped, or Ukraine could have stopped early
on.”</p>
<p>Austin comments echo many concerns voiced by NATO allies in eastern
Europe since the invasion began. Eastern European nations like Estonia,
Romania and Poland have hosted increasing numbers of U.S. troops and
weaponry, while also building up their own defenses to deter Russian
aggression.</p>
<p>Austin spoke with Poland’s Minister of Defense Mariusz Blaszczak
while visiting the Polish base, which officials asked to remain unnamed
because of the major role it plays in pushing U.S. and Western military
aid into Ukraine.</p>
<p>“This matters, because people are trying to survive on the other
end,” Austin said. “There are people dying every day.”</p>
<p>Austin’s trip to Kyiv on Monday was a display of Western solidarity
amid increasing concerns that support for Ukraine could be waning as
U.S. attention is directed to the conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>U.S. Congress has yet to fund additional assistance to Ukraine, which
in turn has caused the Pentagon to start sending smaller military aid
packages to Kyiv in an effort to make the funding they have left last
longer.</p>
<p>During the visit, Austin announced a new U.S. aid package of up to
$100 million from the Pentagon’s weapons stockpiles, including an
additional HIMARS artillery rocket system and more munitions. Prior to
the announcement, he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
and members of his cabinet about the immediate winter fight and planning
for future security assistance.</p>
<p>Monday marked the defense secretary’s first visit to the Ukrainian
capital since April 2022, shortly after the nearly two-year war began.
Russia launched an unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February of that
year, calling the war a “special military operation.”</p>
<p>“We don’t want to live in a world where an autocrat can wake up and …
take over his neighbor’s property,” Austin said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The U.S defense secretary will host another round of talks of the
Ukraine Defense Contact Group virtually from the Pentagon on Wednesday.
The Pentagon says more than 50 nations are expected to participate in
the talks, which help Ukraine’s partners coordinate military aid sent to
Kyiv.</p>
<p>Defense officials say the U.S. will provide a steady stream of
security assistance throughout the winter, and Austin told reporters on
Monday he expects the Ukrainians to be “aggressive” in the weeks
ahead.</p>

<p>This article is for students grades K-4.   A black hole is a place in
space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The
gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space.
This can happen when a star is dying. Because no light can get […]</p>

<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p style>
New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy just announced a
<a href="https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562023/approved/20231121a.shtml" target="_blank">rule</a>
requiring that all new cars sold in the state must be electric by 2035,
with interim goals starting for model year 2027 and ramping up from
there.
</p>
<p style>
Meeting these goals will take an aggressive push given that as of June,
just 1.8% of the state’s light duty vehicles were electric, according to
the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission. To help with the transition,
New Jersey offers rebates — up to $4,000 — on top of federal tax credits
towards EV purchases. And though the Garden State has just 911 public
charging locations as of February, compared to California’s 16,000, it
plans to add 500 more by 2025.
</p>
<p style>
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the state’s EV advocates greeted Murphy’s
announcement with optimism. “Our state needs to reduce our greenhouse
gas emissions and air pollution, and after this announcement we are no
longer sitting in the slow lane while other states pass us by on clean
energy,” Alex Ambrose, a climate policy analyst for New Jersey Policy
Perspective, told local news outlet
<a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2023/11/nj-to-require-all-new-car-sales-to-be-electric-by-2035.html" target="_blank"><em>NJ
Advance Media</em></a>.
</p>
<p style>
The new rule is based on a 2022 California regulation known as
<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-cars-program/advanced-clean-cars-ii" target="_blank">Advanced
Clean Cars II</a>, making New Jersey one of
<a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/advanced-clean-cars-program/states-have-adopted-californias-vehicle-regulations" target="_blank">17
states</a>, including
<a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/press/126879.html" target="_blank">New
York</a> and
<a href="https://mde.maryland.gov/programs/air/MobileSources/Pages/Clean-Energy-and-Cars.aspx" target="_blank">Maryland</a>,
to adopt all or part of California’s low- or zero-emission vehicle
regulations. Crucially, as Kate Klinger of the Governor’s Office of
Climate Action and the Green Economy
<a href="https://www.roi-nj.com/2023/11/21/industry/energy-utilities/report-state-to-mandate-that-all-new-car-sales-be-evs-by-2035/" target="_blank">told</a>
<em>ROI-NJ</em>, Advanced Clean Cars II does not affect the sale of
<em>used</em> cars. So just as a federal assault weapons ban wouldn’t
mean AR-15s suddenly disappear, so too do EV sales targets allow for the
continued existence of internal combustion vehicles.
</p>
<p style>
Will that make 2035 the beginning of a new
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/politics-evs-biden-trump-desantis" target="_blank">environmental
culture war</a> — new-car liberals versus used-car conservatives? We can
only hope. As a native New Jerseyan, I’ll look forward to the day when

meat should be called “Taylor ham” or “pork roll.”

id="us-force-attacked-at-iraq-air-base-responds-by-hitting-iranian-backed-proxies">US
Force Attacked at Iraq Air Base, Responds by Hitting Iranian-Backed
Proxies</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. forces struck and killed Iranian-backed proxies who earlier had
launched a close-range ballistic missile against al-Asad air base in
Iraq on Monday. </p>
<p>It was the first time a ballistic missile had been launched against
U.S. forces in the Middle East since a surge in attacks began on October
17, and the first time U.S. forces have retaliated with a strike in
Iraq.  It marks an escalation from the previous attacks over the past
month, as ballistic missiles can be much more powerful and carry much
more destructive payloads than the rockets and drones used in previous
attacks. </p>
<p>U.S. Central Command said the ballistic missile attack caused eight
injuries to U.S. personnel and minor damage to infrastructure.  </p>
<p>The Pentagon said American forces were able to locate an
Iranian-backed militia vehicle and a number of personnel involved in the
attack. An AC-130 gunship crew then conducted a “self-defense strike” in
retaliation, killing three enemy fighters.  </p>
<p>Iranian-backed proxies have attacked U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria at
least 150 times since President Joe Biden took office, two U.S. defense
officials have told VOA. More than 60 rocket and drone attacks against
U.S. forces have come since October 17. </p>
<p>Most of those attacks were disrupted by the U.S. military or failed
to reach their targets, causing no casualties or damage to
infrastructure, according to the military. But a handful of attacks have
injured dozens of U.S. military personnel, with injuries ranging from
traumatic brain injuries to minor injuries such as shrapnel or
perforated eardrums. Officials say those injured have since returned to
duty.  </p>
<p>One U.S. contractor at al-Asad Air Base in Iraq suffered a cardiac
episode and died while sheltering in place during a false alarm for an
air attack.  </p>
<p>In addition to today’s AC-130 strike in Iraq, U.S. fighter jets have
carried out three rounds of strikes targeting four facilities in Syria
used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and their proxy
groups. </p>
<p>The Middle East has been a tinderbox since Iranian-backed Hamas
launched a terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, killing at least
1,200 people while taking about 200 more people hostage. Israel’s
retaliatory strikes and ground offensive has caused thousands of
deaths.   </p>
<p>The U.S. has increased its presence in the region to protect the
roughly 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq and 900 in Syria and to deter malign
actors, including Iran, the Houthis and Hezbollah and other
Iranian-backed proxy militias, from expanding the Israel-Hamas
conflict.  </p>
<p>A spate of attacks from Iranian-backed militants in March killed a
U.S. contractor in Syria, caused traumatic brain injuries in 23 military
personnel, and wounded 25 U.S. military personnel, according to the
Pentagon.  </p>
<p>The Pentagon responded with air strikes against Iranian-backed
facilities in Syria, much like the strikes carried out by U.S. forces in
recent weeks.  </p>
<p>The last time Iran or Iranian-backed proxies used ballistic missiles
against U.S. forces in Iraq was in 2020 following a U.S. attack in Iraq
the killed Iranian Quds force leader Qassem Soleimani.</p>

The SEC has a long history of refusing to approve spot Bitcoin ETFs, on
the reasonable basis that the Bitcoin market was heavily manipulated.
Crypto-skeptics like
<a href="https://hackernoon.com/meet-spoofy-how-a-single-entity-dominates-the-price-of-bitcoin-39c711d28eb4">Bitfinex’ed</a>
and
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2018/05/24/explaining-the-justice-department-cftc-criminal-investigation-into-bitcoin-trading-and-likely-bitfinex-tether/">Davd
Gerard</a> have been pointing out obvious instances of manipulation for
many years, and there is a considerable academic literature
demonstrating manipulation, such as
<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w30783"><i>Crypto Wash
Trading</i></a> by Lin William Cong <i>et al</i>, which
demonstrates:<br />
<blockquote>
abnormal first-significant-digit distributions, size rounding, and
transaction tail distributions on unregulated exchanges reveal rampant
manipulations unlikely driven by strategy or exchange heterogeneity. We
quantify the wash trading on each unregulated exchange, which averaged
over 70% of the reported volume.
</blockquote>
Unfortunately, despite knowing about the manipulation, the
<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/29/bitcoin-could-double-in-price-under-cftc-regulation-chairman-behnam-says/">CFTC
approved Bitcoin futures ETFs</a>. Among the requests that the
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/07/pump-and-dump-schemes.html">SEC
refused</a> was one from
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2022/04/grayscale-bitcoin-trust.html">Grayscale
Bitcoin Trust</a>. Grayscale sued the SEC and, back in August, the panel
of judges
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/whats-stake-grayscales-spot-bitcoin-etf-case-against-sec-2023-08-29/">ruled
in their favor</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The court’s panel of judges said Grayscale showed that its proposed
bitcoin ETF is “materially similar” to the approved bitcoin futures
ETFs. That’s because the underlying assets— bitcoin and bitcoin futures
- are “closely correlated,” and because the surveillance sharing
agreements with the CME are “identical and should have the same
likelihood of detecting fraudulent or manipulative conduct in the market

SEC was “arbitrary and capricious” to reject the filing because it
“never explained why Grayscale owning bitcoins rather than bitcoin
futures affects the CME’s ability to detect fraud.”
</blockquote>
The prospect of the SEC approving this ETF and others from, for example,
BlackRock and Fidelity led to something of a buying frenzy in Bitcoin as
shown in the “price” chart, and in headlines such as
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-10/bitcoin-etf-exuberance-drives-four-week-nothing-for-sale-rally"><i>Bitcoin
ETF Exuberance Drives Four-Week ‘Nothing for Sale’ Rally</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Bitcoin is climbing for a fourth consecutive week, with the digital
token’s price lingering just below an 18-month high of $38,000, as more
investors bet that US exchange-traded funds that hold the largest
cryptocurrency are on the verge of winning regulatory approval.
</blockquote>
Below the fold I look into where this euphoria came from, and why it
might be misplaced<br /> <span><a name='more'></a></span> <br /> There
already are spot Bitcoin ETFs, just not in the USA. I believe the

launched</a> in:<br />

February 2021, when the

bitcoin ETF</a> launched in Canada. Unlike GBTC, which trades
over-the-counter, Purpose trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange, close to
NAV. At 1%, its management fees are half that of GBTC. Within a month of
trading, Purpose quickly absorbed more than $1 billion worth of assets.
</blockquote>
So why would a US-based Bitcoin ETF be a big deal? The thesis is that by
making it easier for US <strike>investors</strike>gamblers to put money
into BTC it would increase demand and thus the price. This anticipated
flood of retail money would solve the long-standing problem for
cryptocurrency exchanges and whales, the

The number of over-the-counter desks has declined, with mainly the more

The “price” has been soaring, even though the anticipated flood of
retail dollars hasn’t yet, and may never, show up. That is the real
problem, as shown in the graph of Coinbase’s trading volume. Volume, and
thus liquidity, has collapsed since the heady days of 2021. In

The numbers show three things clearly:<br />
<ul>
<li>
Retail trading fee income has collapsed, down 87% from its peak.
</li>
<li>
Institutional trading fee income has collapsed 84% from its peak.
</li>
<li>
Coinbase is wholly dependent upon retail traders, who account for around
95% of its fee income.
</li>
</ul>
Castor and Gerard
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/11/07/coinbase-q3-earnings-regulatory-clarity-is-all-we-need-and-a-miracle-or-two/">write</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Trading volume is the lifeblood of a crypto exchange — and Coinbase’s is
through the floor. The exchange saw $76 billion in total trading volume
in Q3, down from $92 billion in Q2. (They did $547 billion in trading
volume in Q4 2021, their last profitable quarter.)
</blockquote>
So volume is down 84% from its peak. No wonder Coinbase laid off staff
in
<a href="https://nypost.com/2022/06/18/coinbases-layoffs-show-growing-callous-side-of-cryptos-plummet/">June
2022</a> and
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/business/coinbase-layoffs-crypto.html">January
2023</a>. And why

just raised money</a> at less than half its valuation in 2022.<br />
<br /> The problems are exacerbated by the fact that last June the
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/06/07/the-sec-sues-coinbase-its-on/">SEC
sued Coinbase</a> for:<br />
<blockquote>
selling unregistered securities and running an exchange, a
broker-dealer, and a clearinghouse as part of the same operation — and
without registering any of these.
</blockquote>
Castor and Gerard
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/11/07/coinbase-q3-earnings-regulatory-clarity-is-all-we-need-and-a-miracle-or-two/">point
out that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
If the SEC wins, Coinbase may have to stop trading in any cryptos other
than CFTC-regulated commodity coins such as bitcoin. There isn’t enough
volume in those for Coinbase to live on.<br /> <br /> This is why
Coinbase is so insistent on trading blatant unregistered securities —
it’s all they have left for a business model.
</blockquote>
Lynn Parramore transcribes an interview with Jim Chanos in
<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/11/jim-chanos-the-crypto-ecosystem-is-well-suited-for-the-dark-side-of-finance.html"><i>Jim
Chanos: “The Crypto Ecosystem Is Well-Suited for the Dark Side of
Finance.”</i></a> that expresses the famed short-seller’s
skepticism:<br />
<blockquote>
JC: … The last iteration that you just touched upon is the hope by
aspects of Wall Street that crypto gets institutionalized because the
one thing that Bitcoin really has — and we’ve pointed this out to our
clients — is ridiculous levels of transaction fees associated with it.
So Coinbase, for example, which is one of our shorts, charges customers
over 4% per round trip trade to transact in a so-called currency.<br />
<br /> <b>LP: Why would people be willing to pay that?</b><br /> <br />
JC: Well, exactly. They think the asset price is going to go up. It’s
like a Nasdaq stock, not a currency. So they’ll pay, and Wall Street
wants the fees. The cost structure in crypto is quite high and so the
fees are really high. You need retail investors because institutions
aren’t going to be paying 4% per round trip to buy and sell Bitcoin. Mom
and Pop are, so Wall Street needs to keep the public interested in the
crypto space. The paradox, of course, is that if BlackRock and Vanguard
and whoever do get ETFs, it’s actually going to force fees down, not up,
because ETF fees will be a fraction of the cost of what Coinbase or
Binance charge. It’s like mutual fund fees and stock trading fees:
they’ve all converged to zero.
</blockquote>
So, even if there <i>is</i> a flood of retail money into Bitcoin ETFs,
the exchanges’ fee income isn’t going to recover. Chanos’ students share
his
<a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/11/jim-chanos-the-crypto-ecosystem-is-well-suited-for-the-dark-side-of-finance.html">skepticism
about the industry</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<b>LP: Are your Wisconsin students still excited about crypto?</b><br />
<br /> JC: They were much more enthusiastic in 2021, 2020, 2019. There’s
a lot less enthusiasm now in terms of students going to work for a
crypto startup or whatever. I had a number of them in 2020 and 2021 who
said they were going to work in the digital currency or blockchain
space. I don’t hear that as much anymore.<br /> <br /> <b>LP: How about
your Yale students?</b><br /> <br /> JC: The last two springs, they’ve
been skeptical. During the spring semester of 2022, Bankman-Fried’s
now-infamous interview with Bloomberg dropped about an hour before my
class started. I ran to the audiovisual department to see if I could get
the interview up on our screen because to me it was such a bombshell.
This was where Bankman-Fried basically called the crypto ecosystem a
giant Ponzi scheme. I told the class it was very rare to get an industry
leader telling you that his industry is a Ponzi scheme. That was seven
months before the collapse.
</blockquote>
Will the flood happen? Teresa Xie’s
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-04/former-crypto-day-traders-say-no-thanks-even-as-bitcoin-roars-back"><i>Former
Crypto Day Traders Say No Thanks Even as Bitcoin Roars Back</i></a>
presents some negative evidence:<br />
<blockquote>
Craig Murray, who estimates he made almost $200,000 in the market, says
he escaped losing everything to FTX by a hair after friends in the
industry heard whispers about its imminent collapse. By that point, the
23-year-old — who lives in New York and recently dropped out of
Vanderbilt University — had made up his mind.<br /> <br /> “That kind of
put me over the edge,” Murray said. “I just decided it wasn’t worth it.
Why would I have my money in this space when there’s a chance that one
day it could just all go away?”<br /> <br /> Another sign that retail
investing in crypto isn’t returning to previous levels can be seen in
weekday versus weekend volumes, with the presumption that the typical
person trading on a weekend is a day trader.<br /> <br /> “It’s not
unusual nowadays to see weekday trading volume average 50% higher values
than weekend trading volume, whereas in the past this ratio was almost
1:1,” said Fredrick Collins, chief executive and founder of crypto data
platform Velo Data.
</blockquote>
So it seems unlikely that there will be a huge flood of retail dollars
into the market. Even if there were, they would go into Bitcoin ETFs,
which would present the exchanges with two big problems:<br />
<ul>
<li>
much less retail trading, because it would migrate to ETFs for low fees
and the security of dealing with institutions like BlackRock,
</li>
<li>
and a much higher proportion of very low fee institutional trading.
</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems likely that even if the cryptosphere’s hopes for ETFs
materialize the exchanges will end up in an even worse position than
they now are.<br /> <br /></p>

<h1>
Wie viel Geschichte braucht die Welt?
</h1>
<p>
(Ich rede natürlich von der Welt im Rollenspiel und vom meinen
<a href="/pdfs/Horte.pdf">Horte</a> Traktat im besonderen.)
</p>
<p>
Die Geschichte ist nur insofern relevant, als sie als Inspiration für
alte Ruinen und magische Gegenstände dient, auf Buchtiteln und
Inschriften erwähnt wird. Ein genauer Zeitstrahl ist nicht wichtig,
ausser man ist Gelehrter statt Abenteurer.
</p>
<p>
Die Kriege liefern beispielsweise die “Erklärung” für gewisse
<a href="2023-11-18-magische-waffen">magische Waffen</a> – und umgekehrt
verleihen die Zusätze bei den magischen Waffen der Welt etwas Tiefe. Das
ist, wie wenn man von Geschichte keine Ahnung hat und zum ersten Mal von
den Kriegen unserer Welt hört.
</p>
<h3>
Kriege der Vergangenheit
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Drachenkriege</em>, als Elfen gegen Drachen gekämpft haben; so
sollen die Elfen die erste Magie gelernt haben
</li>
<li>
<em>Echsenkriege</em> oder <em>Die Dunklen Tage</em>, als gegen
Schlangenmenschen und Nagas aus Myrkheim gekämpft wurde; hier wurden die
Zugänge zu den anderen Welten entdeckt
</li>
<li>
<em>Befreiungskriege</em>, als gegen die Echsenmensche und ihre Magie
gekämpft wurde; hier ist die Zivilisation der Echsenmenschen
untergegangen
</li>
<li>
<em>Waldkriege</em>, als Elfen und Baumhirten gegen Maschinenbau und
Stahl gekämpft haben; das ist der Grund, warum die grossen Maschinen
nicht mehr funktionieren und das Wissen um die Mechanik verloren
gegangen ist
</li>
<li>
<em>Philosophenkriege</em>, als Sprengstoff und Maschinen gegen
Magieschulen und Tempelherrschaft gekämpft haben; deswegen gibt es nun
überall Magie und Aberglauben, Götteranbetung und Wunder
</li>
<li>
<em>Vampirkriege</em>, als gegen Vampire aus Niflheim gekämpft wurde;
deswegen ist klar, dass die Vampire bis ans Ender der Zeit die Feinde
der Menschheit sind
</li>
<li>
<em>Winterkriege</em> oder <em>Das Jahr ohne Sommer</em>, als gegen
Frostriesen und Eiswölfe gekämpft wurde; deswegen ist der Übergang in
die Welt von Eis und Schnee noch so oft möglich
</li>
<li>
<em>Befreiungskriege</em>, <em>Die Landnahme</em>, <em>Der
Aufstand</em>, <em>Die Schweinekriege</em> und andere Kriege der Orks;
dies erklärt die grosse Feindschaft zwischen Menschen und Orks, da die
Missverständnisse, Ungerechtigkeiten und Gräueltaten seit Jahrhunderten
nicht enden wollen
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Reiche der Nekromantie
</h3>
<p>
Dies sind die Hexen und Nekromanten, die zur Unsterblichkeit gefunden
haben und sich dann bekriegt haben. Ihnen ist gemeinsam, dass sie an
Pässen Wachtürme gebaut haben, die durch Zauberei geschützt waren,
flammende Inschriften bezeugen noch immer alte Grenzen und untote
Wächter bewachen noch immer die alten Zugänge.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Alice</em>, Herrin über die Kinder, deren Geist sie knechtete
</li>
<li>
<em>Childebert</em>, Herr der Schlachtfelder, wo er die Toten wieder
erweckt hat
</li>
<li>
<em>Constance</em>, Herrin der Zeit, die Freunde und Feinde in gläserne
Särge goss
</li>
<li>
<em>Galswintha</em>, Herrin von Schlaf und Benebelung, Lähmung und
Unfruchtbarkeit
</li>
<li>
<em>Gundobad</em>, Herr des Wahnsinns, grosser Expedition, die allesamt
verloren gingen
</li>
<li>
<em>Gundred</em>, Herrin der Opfer und der Scheiterhaufen, dem Land der
Asche
</li>
<li>
<em>Herlewin</em>, Herr der Verträge, Seelenkäufer und Teufelsanbeter
</li>
<li>
<em>Isolda</em>, Herrin der verlorenen Seelen, der hoffnungslosen Liebe
und ewiger Melancholie
</li>
<li>
<em>Osbert</em>, Herr der eifrigen Jugend, der Irreführung, der Kriege
und der Massaker
</li>
<li>
<em>Sybilla</em>, Herrin der Prophezeiung, die immer wusste, wo ihre
Feinde waren, und sie dort hat umbringen lassen

<h2 id="cheap-backups">Cheap backups</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Cheap backups
</h1>
<p>
Every day is backup day. I use BorgBackup to backup up my laptop to one
of two external disks. One of these is always at the office, so there
are three copies: on my laptop, on a backup disk at home and on a backup
disk at the office. It’s important that those three are never in the
same location.
</p>
<p>
I do concede, however, that it’s tricky setup.
</p>
<p>
For my wife, I’ve set up the Mac to backup the laptop and an external
disk with media files to one of two external disks. Again, one of these
is always at the office. So, same deal, except now I’m using TimeMachine
instead of BorgBackup. Somehow, that makes it take a very long time. But
it seems to work.
</p>
<p>
Still, plugging in backup disks, carrying them to the office, bringing
the other one back, plugging it in again… as you can imagine, we don’t
do this nearly often enough.
</p>
<p>
So I need a quick way to backup stuff. Like, super quick. Super cheap.
</p>
<p>
The simplest option I can think of is to use rsync on the local disk
because it has an option to create links for files ­– and while a link
doesn’t take zero space, it takes a lot less space than making a copy.
</p>
<p>
So what I wanted was a quick command that I can run in the directory I’m
in and it creates a backup using rsync.
</p>
<p>
I’ve used the following bash script. Let me know if it can be improved.
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/bash
d=$(basename $(pwd))
t=$(date --iso-8601)
echo Creating a snapshot of $d in ../$d-$t
rsync --link-dest &quot;../$d&quot; --archive . &quot;../$d-$t/&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>
That is, if the current directory is <code>/home/alex/src/wiki</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
it creates the backup in <code>/home/alex/src/wiki-2023-11-19</code>
(appending today’s date)
</li>
<li>
from there, the links all point to the original (where the command was
invoked)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When I use <code>ls -l</code>, this is what it looks like:
</p>
<pre><code>drwxr-xr-x 67 alex alex 749568 18. Nov 23:56 wiki/
drwxr-xr-x 67 alex alex 548864 17. Okt 23:43 wiki-2023-10-17/
drwxr-xr-x 67 alex alex 548864 19. Okt 22:47 wiki-2023-10-19/
drwxr-xr-x 67 alex alex 552960 30. Okt 13:18 wiki-2023-10-30/
</code></pre>
<p>
It’s not great, but it works.
</p>
<p>
For a file that hasn’t changed, you’ll see that <code>ls -l</code> says
there are four links to this file. This is correct: one link for every
directory. The data exists only once, on the disk.
</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ls -l w*/2000-03-10_Elendor.md 
-rw-r--r-- 4 alex alex 16313 28. Apr 2017  wiki/2000-03-10_Elendor.md
-rw-r--r-- 4 alex alex 16313 28. Apr 2017  wiki-2023-10-17/2000-03-10_Elendor.md
-rw-r--r-- 4 alex alex 16313 28. Apr 2017  wiki-2023-10-19/2000-03-10_Elendor.md
-rw-r--r-- 4 alex alex 16313 28. Apr 2017  wiki-2023-10-30/2000-03-10_Elendor.md
</code></pre>
<p>
For a file that changes all the time, <code>ls -l</code> shows that
there is just one link for every file, meaning that these files are
distinct. And for a lay person, that is confirmed by the different file
size and last modified timestamp.
</p>
<pre><code>&gt; ls -l w*/changes.md
-rw-r--r-- 1 alex alex 1997 17. Okt 16:28 wiki-2023-10-17/changes.md

out, this only works if the editing you do always recreates the files
you’re editing (because then these files get a new inode even if their
names stay the same). Examples where this is a problem: database files
are updated in place; some editors allow you to decide how backups are
created. Emacs, for example, has the option
<code>backup-by-copying</code> which is nil by default. When you save a
file, the original is renamed to the backup and a new file is written.
If you set the option, however, the backup is copied first, and then the
original is changed in-place (like a database file, without getting a
new inode). Now you’ve changed the file in all the “cheap backup”
directories, since the links keep pointing to the same inode and that
inode now points to the new file.
</p>
<p>
Possibly a better solution that uses copies for the first backup and
then future backups link to the old backups (and never to the originals)
would be the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/bash
d=$(basename $(pwd))
t=$(date --iso-8601)
p=$(find .. -maxdepth 1 -type d -name &quot;$d-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]&quot; -prune | sort | tail -n 1)
if [ -z &quot;$p&quot; ]; then
  echo Creating a snapshot of $d in ../$d-$t
  rsync --archive . &quot;../$d-$t/&quot;
else
  echo Creating a snapshot of $d in ../$d-$t with links into $p
  rsync --link-dest &quot;$p&quot; --archive . &quot;../$d-$t/&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<p>
Note that now, in case you just need a single backup, you might just as
well just make a copy using your favourite file manager. Not so cheap
any more, eh? 🤨
</p>
<p>
Or use
<a href="https://github.com/laurent22/rsync-time-backup/tree/master">rsync-time-backup</a>,
a shell script.
</p>
<p>
Or <a href="https://rsnapshot.org/">rsnapshot</a>, a Perl script.

Naomi Kritzer’s “Liberty’s Daughter” (21 November 2023)</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: Cory Doctorow’s blog</p>
<p>Today’s links Naomi Kritzer’s “Liberty’s Daughter”: The market
authoritarianism of a seastead childhood. Hey look at this: Delights to
delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008, 2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon:
Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing
projects, current reading Naomi Kritzer’s “Liberty’s Daughter”
(permalink) There’s so much sf about “competent men” running their
families with entrepreneurial zeal, clarity of vision and a firm
confident hand. But there’s precious little fiction about how much being
raised by a Heinlein dad would suuuck. But it would, and in Naomi
Kritzer’s Liberty’s Daughter, we get a peek inside the nightmare:
https://fairwoodpress.com/store/p148/LIBERTY%27S_DAUGHTER.html Beck
Garrison is a seasteader, living on a floating platform built by
libertarian cranks to get away from big government, taxes, and the idea
that people owe each other care and consideration. Various kinds of
market trufans have built their own fiefdoms: there’s a sin city, a
biotech free-for-all, a lawless Mad Max zone, and so on. Beck’s father,
Paul, is some kind of local functionary. He’s wealthy and respected,
both a power-broker and a power in his own right. He pays for Beck to
get private tutoring (no public schools – no public anything) and if she
needs bailing out from some kind of sticky situation, he’s got her on
his account with Alpha Dogs, the toughest mercenaries on the sea (no
police, either). An armed society is a polite society, after all. Beck
has a job, naturally (there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch). She’s
a finder: for all that the steaders worship commerce as a sacrament
consecrated to the holy Invisible Hand, there’s not a lot of retail at
sea. California – the nearest onshore neighbor – has lots of pesky
taxes, and besides, it’s a long ways off. Besides, space is at a premium
on the stead, so people don’t have attics and basements to fill with
excess consumer junk. Instead, when a steader needs something – a
shoelace, a fashion accessory, or any other creature comfort – they hire
a finder like Beck to clamber around between the decks of the aircraft
carriers, scows, yachts and other vessels comprising the stead. It’s a
good way for Beck to earn spending money, and she’s a natural at it.
After all, she’s been a steader since she was four, when her mother died
in a drunk driving accident and her father took her to sea. The story
opens with a finding job. Beck wants a pair of sparkly shoes for her
client, and the woman who owns them is an indentured servant whose
sister has gone missing. Find the sister, get the shoes. Indentured
servant? Yeah, of course. Freedom of contract is the one freedom from
which all the others flow, so you can sell yourself into bond labor.
Hell, maybe you can earn enough to buy a share in the stead and become a
co-owner/citizen. This is the setup for Beck’s adventure, which sees her
liberating bond slaves tricked into fatal work details, getting involved
in reality TV production, meeting illegal IWW organizers, and becoming
embroiled in a pandemic that threatens the lives of all the steaders.
It’s a coming of age novel, told with the same straightforward, spunky
zeal of Heinlein’s juvies, but from the perspective of the daughter, not
the dad. Kritzer makes it clear that growing up under the thumb of a
TANSTAAFL-worshipping, self-regarding, wealthy autocrat who worships
selfishness as the necessary precondition for market clearing would be a
goddamned nightmare. She also thinks through some of the important
implications of life in one of these offshore libertarian archipelagos,
like the fact that the wealthy residents would be overwhelming drawn
from the ranks of corporate criminals and tax-cheats, and the underclass
would be bail-skipping proles ensnared in the War on Drugs. But
Liberty’s Daughter isn’t a hymn to big government. Most of the steaders
are escaping the US government, a state whose authoritarian and cruel
proclivities are well-documented. Kritzer uses the labor dispute at the
core of the novel to reveal market authoritarianism – the coercive power
that hunger and poverty transfers from the have-nots to the haves. Think
of Anatole France’s wry observation that “the law, in its majestic
equality, equally forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under
bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.” If you’re familiar
with Kritzer’s work, you won’t be surprised to learn that she tells a
zippy, fast moving tale that smuggles in sharp observations about the
cleavage lines between solidarity and selfishness. Her story “So Much
Cooking” – published years before the pandemic – captured life under
lockdown with eerie prescience:
https://pluralistic.net/2020/04/17/pack-of-knaves/#so-much-cooking More
recently, her “Better Living Through Algorithms” is a dazzling display
of knifework that’ll cut you a dozen times before you even notice that
you’re bleeding:
https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/02/wunderkammer/#jubillee If you
habitually read Kritzer’s short fiction, Liberty’s Daughter might be
familiar to you, as it is adapted from a series of stories that
originally ran in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Kritzer’s
YA debut, Catfishing on the CatNet, was also adapted from a short story,
“Cat Pictures Please,” which won the Hugo Award in 2016:
https://boingboing.net/2019/11/19/setec-astronomy-kitteh.html
“Libertarian exit” – buying a country, or an archipelago, or just a
luxury bunker – has been in the air lately. It’s a major element of my
new novel, The Lost Cause, which came out this month – anarchocapitalist
wreckers try to sabotage the Green New Deal from the seastead they’ve
moored to the tallest point in the drowned Grand Caymans and declared to
be a sovereign nation:
https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250865939/the-lost-cause Kritzer is
great at catching that zeitgeist. Seasteading is part of a long, bitter
dream of a certain kind of selfish person to escape society, a tale told
in lurid and fascinating detail in Raymond Craib’s 2022 history
Adventure Capitalism:
https://pluralistic.net/2022/06/14/this-way-to-the-egress/#terra-nullius
There’s a longstanding joke to the effect that you can shut down any
discussion of the merits of a libertarian exit by asking three questions
about the brave new world: I. Whether you can sell your organs; II.
Whether you can sell yourself into slavery; and III. Whether there is
any age of consent. Kritzer tackles the first two, but tacks around the
third. Instead, by giving us a young adult protagonist who has been
raised in a rusting libertopia, she finds a decidedly less incendiary
way to think about the role of autonomy in adolescents, and thus
generates far more light than heat. The result is a cracking read with a
sting in its tail. Hey look at this (permalink) Build your own Patek

<h2 id="campaign-building-blocks">Campaign building blocks</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: Alex Schroeder’s Blog</p>
<h1>
Campaign building blocks
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://ttrpg-hangout.social/@enfors" title="@enfors@ttrpg-hangout.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="enfors">@enfors</span></a> recently
wondered about “important aspects of sandboxes that one can iterate over
and add to.”
</p>
<p>
I’m reminded of the term “Gygaxian Building Blocks”. I think I first
heard this phrase from
<a class="account" href="https://rollenspiel.social/@settembrini" title="@settembrini@rollenspiel.social"><span
class="citation" data-cites="settembrini">@settembrini</span></a> in
<a href="https://pesa-nexus.de/2020/06/03/episode-1-wir-spielen-add-dmg/">episode
1</a> of <a href="https://pesa-nexus.de/category/zock-bock-radio/">Zock
Bock Radio</a>, a mostly German, sometimes English podcast about
role-playing games. “Gygaxian Building Blocks” are the things one can
add individually to the rules and therefore everybody can participate in
the game as a creator by writing spells, items, monsters, classes, and
so on. These things stand on their own and aren’t usually influenced by
other such blocks. Adding them is easy. Conversely, the core game
without the lists of spells, items, monsters and classes can be
relatively short. It’s a beautiful way of organizing the game.
</p>
<p>
For a sandbox campaign, the things that have that same quality and which
I’d call my “sandbox campaign building blocks” would be:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
powerful people: names, titles and retainers including spells and magic
items
</li>
<li>
settlements: names, a small number of interesting buildings such as
defensive structures and temples, the number of people ready to fight in
case of a battle
</li>
<li>
ruins: mostly dungeons, big or small, often just three to five zones
that may or may not map to “rooms” with monsters and treasure
</li>
<li>
magic schools: these are spell collections by legendary magic users that
facilitate writing up spell selections for other magic-users since I can
select the school they’re from and pick an appropriate subset of spells
(this is what my <a href="Spellcasters">Spellcasters</a> project is all
about)
</li>
<li>
secret societies: names, leaders, and then for each settlement figure
out if the secret society has a presence and if so, who the
representative is
</li>
<li>
gods &amp; demons and their temples: names, themes, and then for each
settlement figure out if there is a shrine or temple and if so, who the
head priest is
</li>
<li>
monsters: I usually like to focus on a subset that is intelligent, with
settlements and plans of their own, almost always humanoids
</li>
<li>
legendary items: as a consequence of treasure allocation for the above,
some powerful magic items entered the sandbox and I need them on a
separate list so that there can be rumours and quests pointing players
towards them
</li>
<li>
permanent portals to other planes: names of these realms, powerful
beings that can be reached (for spells, prayers, summonings…),
environmental effects, rumours and pointing players towards them,
preparing for the high level game
</li>
<li>
rough events in the past: names of wars, sides, immortal necromancer
kings &amp; queens, but only insofar as they help flesh out locations
and magic items etc. – there is no need for a timeline and years, as far
as I am concerned (trying to imagine what I would know without schools
and books – practically nothing except for “Germans bad because of the
World War” and that’s it, I guess?)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Anyway, I think those are the things I am concerned about when I start a
new campaign. As the campaign progresses, I find it easy to add just
<em>one more thing</em> to one of the lists. 😄

<h2 id="record-crowds-expected-in-air-on-roads-for-thanksgiving">Record
Crowds Expected in Air, on Roads for Thanksgiving</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Despite inflation and memories of past holiday travel meltdowns,
millions of people are expected to hit airports and highways in record
numbers over the Thanksgiving break.</p>
<p>The busiest days to fly will be Tuesday and Wednesday as well as the
Sunday after Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 2.6
million passengers on Tuesday and 2.7 million passengers on Wednesday.
Sunday will draw the largest crowds with an estimated 2.9 million
passengers, which would narrowly eclipse a record set on June 30.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AAA forecasts that 55.4 million Americans will travel at
least 80 kilometers from home between next Wednesday and the Sunday
after Thanksgiving, with roads likely to be the most clogged on
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The weather could snarl air and road traffic. A storm system was
expected to move from the southern Plains to the Northeast on Tuesday
and Wednesday, bringing severe thunderstorms, gusty wind and possible
snow.</p>
<p>U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said during a news
conference Monday that the government has tried to better prepare for
holiday travel over the last year by hiring more air traffic
controllers, opening new air routes along the East Coast and providing
grants to airports for snowplows and deicing equipment. But he warned
travelers to check road conditions and flight times before leaving
home.</p>
<p>“Mother Nature, of course, is the X factor in all of this,” he
said.</p>
<p>The good news for travelers by plane and car alike: Prices are coming
down.</p>
<p>Air fares are averaging $268 per ticket, down 14% from a year ago,
according to the travel site Hopper.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices are down about 45 cents a gallon from this time last
year. The national average was $3.30 per gallon on Monday, according to
AAA, down from $3.67 a year ago.</p>
<p>A survey of GasBuddy users found that despite cheaper pump prices,
the number of people planning to take a long driving trip this
Thanksgiving hasn’t changed much from last year. Patrick De Haan, an
analyst for the price-tracking service, said inflation has cooled but
some things like food are still becoming more expensive. Consumers are
also charging more on credit cards and saving less.</p>
<p>“Sure, they love the falling gas prices, but a lot of Americans spent
in other ways this summer and they may not be ready to open their
wallets for Thanksgiving travel just yet,” De Haan said.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving marks the start of the holiday travel season, and many
still haven’t shaken last December’s nightmare before Christmas, when
severe winter storms knocked out thousands of flights and left millions
of passengers stranded.</p>
<p>Scott Keyes, founder of the travel site Going, is cautiously
optimistic that holiday air travel won’t be the same mess. So far this
year, he said, airlines have avoided massive disruptions.</p>
<p>“Everyone understands that airlines can’t control Mother Nature and
it’s unsafe to take off or land in the middle of a thunderstorm or
snowstorm,” Keyes said. “What really irks people are the controllable
cancellations — those widespread disruptions because the airline
couldn’t get their act together because their system melted down the way
Southwest did over Christmas.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Southwest didn’t recover as quickly as other carriers from
last year’s storm when its planes, pilots and flight attendants were
trapped out of position and its crew-rescheduling system got bogged
down. The airline canceled nearly 17,000 flights before fixing the
operation. Federal regulators told Southwest recently that it could be
fined for failing to help stranded travelers.</p>
<p>Southwest officials say they have since purchased additional deicing
trucks and heating equipment and will add staff at cold-weather airports
depending on the forecast. The company said it has also updated its
crew-scheduling technology.</p>
<p>U.S. airlines as a whole have been better about stranding passengers.
Through October, they canceled 38% fewer flights than during the same
period in 2022. From June through August — when thunderstorms can snarl
air traffic — the rate of cancellations fell 18% compared to 2022.</p>
<p>Even still, consumer complaints about airline service have soared,
according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. There have been so
many complaints, the agency says, that it has only compiled figures
through May.</p>
<p>The airlines, in turn, have heaped blame on the Federal Aviation
Administration, which they say can’t keep up with the growing air
traffic. In fact, the Transportation Department’s inspector general
reported this summer that the FAA has made only “limited efforts” to fix
a shortage of air traffic controllers, especially at key facilities in
New York, Miami and Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, staffing levels in other parts of the airline industry
have largely recovered since the pandemic. After shedding tens of
thousands of workers early on, airlines have been on a hiring spree
since late 2020. Passenger airlines have added more than 140,000 workers
— an increase of nearly 40% — according to government figures updated
last week. The number of people working in the business is the largest
since 2001, when there were many more airlines.</p>
<p>Airlines are using their expanded work forces to operate more
flights. Southwest is the most aggressive among the big carriers,
planning to offer 13% more seats over Thanksgiving than it did during
the comparable five-day stretch last year, according to travel data
provider Cirium. United and Delta are growing 8% each. American will
grow a more modest 5% but still have the largest number of seats.</p>

shore with no injuries.</p>
<p>Spokesperson Petty Officer Ryan Fisher said the Coast Guard responded
but that rescue operations were quickly called off.</p>
<p>“It sounds like all parties involved were rescued,” he said.</p>
<p>The P-8A aircraft overshot the runway at a Marine base on Kaneohe
Bay, said U.S. Marine Corps spokesperson Gunnery Sgt. Orlando Perez. He
did not have further information.</p>
<p>A photo taken by a witness showed the plane floating just offshore, a
scene reminiscent of the 2009 “ Miracle on the Hudson,” when a
commercial aircraft piloted by Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger made an
emergency landing on the New York river. All 155 people aboard
survived.</p>
<p>The P-8A and the Airbus A320 that Sullenberger piloted are roughly
the same size.</p>
<p>Diane Dircks, 61, and her family had just returned to the dock after
rainy weather cut their pontoon boat trip short when her daughter
noticed the plane in the water.</p>
<p>“We went running over to the end of the dock, and I took some
pictures,” she said.</p>
<p>They then heard sirens coming from everywhere.</p>
<p>Dircks, who is visiting from Illinois, said her daughter keeps a pair
of binoculars on her for birdwatching, so she was able to see the plane
and the rescue boats arriving.</p>
<p>“It was unbelievable,” she said.</p>
<p>The Honolulu Fire Department received a 911 call for a downed
aircraft shortly after 2 p.m., spokesperson Malcolm K. Medrano said in
an email.</p>
<p>It was cloudy and rainy at the time. Visibility was about 1.6
kilometers, said Thomas Vaughan, a National Weather Service
meteorologist in Honolulu.</p>
<p>The P-8A is often used to hunt for submarines and reconnaissance and
intelligence gathering. It is manufactured by Boeing and shares many
parts with the 737 commercial jet.</p>
<p>The plane belongs to the Skinny Dragons of Patrol Squadron
4 stationed at Whidbey Island in Washington state. Patrol squadrons were
once based at Kaneohe Bay, but now they deploy to Hawaii on a rotational
basis.</p>
<p>Marine Corps Base Hawaii is about 16 kilometers from Honolulu on
Oahu. The base houses about 9,300 military personnel and 5,100 family
members. It’s one of several key military installations on Oahu.</p>
<p>The base sits on Kaneohe Bay, which is also home to coral reefs, a
breeding ground for hammerhead sharks and a University of Hawaii marine
biology research institute.</p>

<h2 id="two-turkeys-liberty-and-bell-pardoned-by-biden">Two Turkeys
‘Liberty’ and ‘Bell’ Pardoned by Biden</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>“Liberty” and “Bell” — two turkeys — strutted onto the White House
South Lawn Monday and became immediate celebrities for what has become
the official beginning of the holidays in Washington.</p>
<p>Amid an autumn day, with Christmas carols playing, President Joe
Biden addressed the families of staff, 4-H and Future Farmers of
America, and students from Eliot-Hine Middle School as they gathered for
the popular event.</p>
<p>Next to him stood a table lined with a fall garland of burgundy,
green, orange and yellow, bearing a sign “Happy Thanksgiving 2023.”
Standing on it was an 18 kg (40lb) turkey, with another next to it on
the ground, beside the Minnesota farmers who raised them.</p>
<p>“I hereby pardon Liberty and Bell,” said Biden, as the male turkey
fanned its tail. And, with that, the two birds were given the long-held
tradition of a long life, just days prior to the American holiday that
features a roasted turkey as its centerpiece.</p>
<p>Turkeys on leashes at the White House</p>
<p>In 1989, then President George H.W. Bush promised a crowd of children
and reporters that the 23 kg (50lb) turkey donated to the White House
would not be eaten.</p>
<p>President Bush was the first to make the pardon an annual action, but
not the first to show mercy for a bird. The son of President Abraham
Lincoln treated the turkey like a dog, leading him around on a leash
inside the White House. Ultimately, President Lincoln granted the turkey
clemency.</p>
<p>The act of donating a turkey (or a gaggle of gobblers) dates to the
1800s and embraces the nation’s heritage of farmland. For the past
month, Biden has traveled to rural America, announcing $5 billion in
investments.</p>
<p>“We’re restoring hope and opportunity so family farms can stay in the
family,” proclaimed Biden at Monday’s event, “and children don’t have to
leave home if they wish to stay and make a living on the farm.”</p>
<p>Biden told the crowd that the birds love the Minnesota favorites,
including Honeycrisp apples, ice hockey, a thousand lakes and the Mall
of America.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Happy 81st birthday</p>
<p>President Biden’s 81st birthday coincided with the holiday event. He
evoked laughter when he told the crowd, “I just want you to know, it’s
difficult turning 60.” The president’s age has been raised by opponents
and analysts as he seeks a second term. During his speech Monday, Biden
confused Britney Spears with Taylor Swift when referencing Swift’s Eras
tour in Brazil.</p>
<p>The president plans to celebrate his birthday with family this
weekend in Nantucket.</p>
<p>The birds will live on as agriculture models at the University of
Minnesota. Having been named after the Liberty Bell, the symbol of
independence in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the president said his
pardon gave the turkeys “a new appreciation for the words, ‘Let freedom
ring.’”</p>

<h2 id="openai-is-a-cautionary-tale-about-nonprofits">OpenAI Is a
Cautionary Tale About Nonprofits</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDUyMzM1OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcxOTM2MDU4OH0.94OPR0jhyFXPWQo4w-_uLZBBmosxhV55rpLd6GoGsK0/image.jpg?width=1195&height=795&coordinates=3%2C5%2C2%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps" style>
Surely you’ve heard by now. On Friday, the board of directors of OpenAI,
the world-bestriding startup at the center of the new artificial
intelligence boom, fired its chief executive, Sam Altman. He had not
been “consistently candid” with the board, the company said, setting in
motion a coup — and potential counter-coup — that has transfixed the
tech, business, and media industries for the past 72 hours.
</p>
<p style>
OpenAI is — was? — a strange organization. Until last week, it was both
the country’s hottest new tech company and an independent nonprofit
<a href="https://openai.com/charter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">devoted
to ensuring</a> that a hypothetical, hyper-intelligent AI “benefits all
of humanity.” The nonprofit board owned and controlled the for-profit
startup, but it did not fund it entirely; the startup could and did
accept outside investment, such as
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
$13 billion infusion</a> from Microsoft.
</p>
<p style>
This kind of dual nonprofit/for-profit structure isn’t uncommon in the
tech industry. The encrypted messaging app
<a href="https://signal.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Signal</a>,
for instance, is owned by
<a href="https://signalfoundation.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
foundation</a>, as is the company that makes
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
cheap, programmable microchip Raspberry Pi</a>. The open-source browser
Firefox
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-05/why-google-keeps-paying-mozilla-s-firefox-even-as-chrome-dominates" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is
overseen</a> by the Mozilla Foundation.
</p>
<p style>
But OpenAI’s structure is unusually convoluted, with two nested holding
companies and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-11-20/who-controls-openai#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank">a
growing split</a> between who was providing the money (Microsoft) and
who ostensibly controlled operations (the nonprofit board). That tension
between the nonprofit board and the for-profit company is what
ultimately ripped apart OpenAI, because when the people with control
(the board) tried to fire Altman, the people with the money (Microsoft)
said no. As I write this, Microsoft seems
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-20/openai-staff-threaten-to-go-to-microsoft-if-board-doesn-t-quit" target="_blank">likely</a>
to win.
</p>
<p>
This may all seem remote from what we cover here at Heatmap. Other than
the fact that ChatGPT devours electricity, OpenAI doesn’t obviously have
anything to do with climate change, electric vehicles, or the energy
transition. Sometimes I even have the sense that many climate advocates
take a certain delight in high-profile AI setbacks, because they resent
competing with it for existential-risk airtime.
</p>
<p>
Yet OpenAI’s schism is a warning for climate world. Strip back the
money, the apocalypticism, the big ideas and <em>Terminator</em>
references, and OpenAI is fundamentally a story about nonprofit
governance. When a majority of the board decided to knock Altman from
his perch, nobody could stop them. They alone decided to torch $80
billion in market value overnight and set their institution on fire.
Whether that was the right or wrong choice, it illustrates how nonprofit
organizations — especially those that, like OpenAI, are controlled
solely by a board of directors — act with an unusual amount of arbitrary
authority.
</p>
<p style>
Why does that matter for the climate or environmental movement? Because
the climate and energy world is absolutely<em> teeming</em> with
nonprofit organizations — and many of them are just as unconstrained,
just as willfully wacky, as OpenAI.

Let’s step back. Nonprofits can generally be governed in two ways.
(Apologies to nonprofit lawyers in the audience: I’m about to vastly
simplify your specialty.) The first is a chapter- or membership-driven
structure, in which a mass membership elects leaders to serve on a board
of directors. Many unions, social clubs, and business groups take this
form: Every few years, the members elect a new president or board of
directors, who lead the organization for the next few years.
</p>
<p>
The other way is a so-called “board-only” organization. In this
structure, the nonprofit’s board of directors leads the organization and
does not answer to a membership or chapter. (There is often no
membership to answer to.) When a vacancy opens up on the board, its
remaining members appoint a replacement, perpetuating itself over time.
</p>
<p>
OpenAI was just such
<a href="https://www.501c3.org/kb/board-of-directors-vs-membership-governance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
board-only organization</a>. Even though Altman was CEO, OpenAI was led
officially by its board of directors.
</p>
<p>
This is a stranger way of running an organization than it may seem. For
a small, private foundation, it may work just fine: Such an organization
has no staff and probably meets rarely. (Most U.S. nonprofits are just
this sort of organization.) But when a board-only nonprofit gets big —
when it fulfills a crucial public purpose or employs hundreds or
thousands of people — it faces an unusual <em>lack</em> of institutional
constraints.
</p>
<p>
Consider, for instance, what life is like for a decently sized business,
a small government agency, and a medium-sized nonprofit. The decently
sized business is constantly buffeted by external forcing factors. Its
creditors need to be repaid; it is battling for market share and product
position. It faces market discipline or at least some kind of profit
motive. It has to remain focused, competitive, and at least
theoretically efficient.
</p>
<p>
The government agency, meanwhile, is constrained by public scrutiny and
political oversight. Its bureaucrats and public servants are managed by
elected officials, who are themselves accountable to the public. When a
particularly important agency is not doing its job, voters can demand a
change or elect new leadership.
</p>
<p>
Nonprofits can have some of the same built-in checks and balances — but
only when they are controlled by <em>members, </em>and not by a board.
If a members association embarrasses itself, for instance, or if it
doesn’t carry out its mission, then its membership can vote out the
board and elect new directors to replace them. But stakeholders have no
such recourse for a board-only nonprofit. Insulated from market pressure
and public oversight, board-only nonprofits are free to wander off into
wackadoodle land.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that board-only nonprofits are only becoming more
powerful — in fact, many of the nonprofits you know best are probably
controlled solely by their board. In 2002, the Harvard political
scientist Theda Skocpol
<a href="https://prospect.org/power/associations-without-members/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">observed</a>
that American civic life had undergone a rapid transformation: where it
had once been full of membership-driven federations, such as the Lions
Club or the League of Women Voters, it was now dominated by
issues-focused advocacy groups.
</p>
<p>
From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, she wrote, America “had a
uniquely balanced civic life, in which markets expanded but could not
subsume civil society, in which governments at multiple levels
deliberately and indirectly encouraged federated voluntary
associations.” But from the 1960s to the 1990s, that old network fell
apart. It was “bypassed and shoved to the side by a gaggle of
professionally dominated advocacy groups and nonprofit institutions
rarely attached to memberships worthy of the name,” Skocpol wrote.
</p>
<p>
The sheer number of groups exploded. In 1958, the Encyclopedia of
Associations listed approximately 6,500 associations, Skocpol writes. By
1990, that number had more than tripled to 23,000. Today, the American
Society of Association Executives — which is, just so we’re clear here,
literally an association for associations —
<a href="https://powerofassociations.org/facts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">counts
almost 1.9 million associations</a>, including 1.2 million nonprofits.
</p>
<p>
This new network includes some nonprofits that claim to have members but
are not in fact governed by them, such as
<a href="https://www.aarp.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
AARP</a>. It includes “public citizen” or legal-advocacy groups, which
watchdog legislation or fight for important precedents in the courts,
such as
<a href="https://earthjustice.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Earthjustice</a>,
<a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
Center for Biological Diversity</a>, or
<a href="https://www.citizen.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Public
Citizen</a> itself. And it includes independent, mission-driven, and
board-controlled nonprofits — such as OpenAI.
</p>
<p>
There is nothing wrong with these new groups per se. Many of them are
inspired by the advocacy and legal organizations that won some of the
Civil Rights Movement’s biggest victories. But unlike the member
federations and civic associations that they largely replaced, these new
groups don’t force Americans to engage with what their neighbors are
thinking and feeling. So they “compartmentalize” America, in Skocpol’s
words. Instead of articulating the views of a deep, national membership
network, these groups essentially speak for a centralized and
professionalized leadership corps — invariably located in a major city —
who are armed with modern marketing techniques. And instead of
fundraising through dues, fees, or tithes, these new groups depend on
direct-mail operations, massive ad campaigns, and foundation grants.
</p>
<p style>
This is the organizational superstructure on which much of the modern
climate movement rests. When you read a climate news story, someone
quoted in it will probably work for such a nonprofit. Many climate and
energy policy experts spend at least part of their careers at some kind
of nonprofit. Most climate or environmental news outlets — although not
this one — are funded in whole or part through donations and foundation
grants. And most climate initiatives that earn mainstream attention
receive grants from a handful of foundations.
</p>
<p style>
There is nothing <em>necessarily</em> wrong with this setup — and, of
course, an equivalent network devoted to stopping and delaying climate
policy exists to rival it on the right. But the entire design places an
enormous amount of faith in the leaders of these nonprofits and
foundations, and in the social strata that they occupy. If a nonprofit
messes up, then only public attention or press coverage can right the
ship. And there is simply not enough of either resource to keep these
things on track.
</p>
<p style>
That leads to odd resource allocation decisions, business units that
seem to have no purpose (alongside teams that seem perpetually
overworked), and decisions that frame otherwise decent policies in
politically unpalatable ways. It regularly burns out people involved in
climate organizations. And it means that much of the climate movement’s
strategy is controlled by foundation officials and nonprofit directors.
Like any other group of executives, these people are capable of deluding
themselves about what is happening in the world; <em>unlike </em>other
types of leaders, however, they face neither an angry electorate nor a
ruthless market that will force them to update their worldview. The risk
exists, then, that they could blunder into disaster — and take the
climate movement with them.

<p>While Elementary OS commits to Wayland, the development team of the
Budgie desktop is changing course and will work with the Xfce developers
toward Budgie’s Wayland future. There is general consensus now that the
future of graphical desktops on Linux lies in Wayland rather than X11,
but the path is still not a smooth and easy one. While in Latvia for the
Ubuntu Summit, the Reg FOSS desk met with the developers behind Ubuntu
Budgie, who told us that the Budgie project is charting a new course
toward the brave new Wayland world. It seems that using EFL – the
Enlightenment Foundation Libraries – wasn’t the right choice for Budgie,
and so they’re now exploring working with Xfce on their Wayland efforts,
instead. Considering Enlightenment’s desktop Linux presence is
negligible, at best, joining forces with Xfce so that both Xfce and
Budgie can make progress on Wayland faster seems like the more optimal
choice for the wider desktop Linux community.</p>

id="solar-panels-over-canals-in-gila-river-indian-community-will-help-save-water">Solar
Panels Over Canals in Gila River Indian Community Will Help Save
Water</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>In a move that may soon be replicated elsewhere, the Gila River
Indian Community recently signed an agreement with the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers to put solar panels over a stretch of irrigation canal on
its land south of Phoenix.</p>
<p>It will be the first project of its kind in the United States to
break ground, according to the tribe’s press release.</p>
<p>“This was a historic moment here for the community but also for the
region and across Indian Country,” said Gila River Indian Community
Governor Stephen Roe Lewis in a video published on X, formerly known as
Twitter.</p>
<p>The first phase, set to be completed in 2025, will cover 1,000 feet
of canal and generate one megawatt of electricity that the tribe will
use to irrigate crops, including feed for livestock, cotton and
grains.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: install solar panels over canals in sunny,
water-scarce regions where they reduce evaporation and make renewable
electricity.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to be leaders in water conservation, and this project is
going to do just that,” Lewis said, noting the significance of a Native,
sovereign, tribal nation leading on the technology.</p>
<p>A study by the University of California, Merced estimated that 63
billion gallons of water could be saved annually by covering
California’s 4,000 miles of canals. More than 100 climate advocacy
groups are advocating for just that.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that much of the installed solar canopies would
additionally generate a significant amount of electricity.</p>
<p>UC Merced wants to hone its initial estimate and should soon have the
chance. Not far away in California’s Central Valley, the Turlock
Irrigation District and partner Solar AquaGrid plan to construct 1.6
miles (2.6 kilometers) of solar canopies over its canals beginning this
spring and researchers will study the benefits.</p>
<p>Neither the Gila River Indian Community nor the Turlock Irrigation
District are the first to implement this technology globally. Indian
engineering firm Sun Edison inaugurated the first solar-covered canal in
2012 on one of the largest irrigation projects in the world in Gujarat
state. Despite ambitious plans to cover 11,800 miles (19,000 kilometers)
of canals, only a handful of small projects ever went up, and the
engineering firm filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>High capital costs, clunky design and maintenance challenges were
obstacles for widespread adoption, experts say.</p>
<p>But severe, prolonged drought in the western U.S. has centered water
as a key political issue, heightening interest in technologies like
cloud seeding and solar-covered canals as water managers grasp at any
solution that might buoy reserves, even ones that haven’t been widely
tested, or tested at all.</p>
<p>Still, the project is an important indicator of the tribe’s
commitment to water conservation, said Heather Tanana, a visiting law
professor at the University of California, Irvine and citizen of the
Navajo Nation. Tribes hold the most senior water rights on the Colorado
River, though many are still settling those rights in court.</p>
<p>“There’s so much fear about the tribes asserting their rights and if
they do so, it’ll pull from someone else’s rights,” she said. The tribe
leaving water in Lake Mead and putting federal dollars toward projects
like solar canopies is “a great example to show that fear is
unwarranted.”</p>
<p>The federal government has made record funding available for
water-saving projects, including a $233 million pact with the Gila River
Indian Community to conserve about two feet of water in Lake Mead, the
massive and severely depleted reservoir on the Colorado River. Phase one
of the solar canal project will cost $6.7 million and the Bureau of
Reclamation provided $517,000 for the design.</p>

#Crossref2023?</h2>
<p>date: 2023-11-21, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Have you attended any of our annual meeting sessions this year? Ah, yes
– there were many in this conference-style event. I, as many of my
colleagues, attended them all because it is so great to connect with our
global community, and hear your thoughts on the developments at
Crossref, and the stories you share.
</p>
<p>
Let me offer some highlights from the event and a reflection on some
emergent themes of the day. You can browse the recordings and slides
archived on our
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/crossref-live-annual/">Annual Meeting
page</a>.
</p>
<p>
Ginny Hendricks opened the meeting by reminding everyone about the
research nexus vision, and the work that’s underway to bring us closer
to it. Ginny went on to highlight progress in metadata and relationships
being registered by our members, and mentioned members that have
particularly rich metadata records – with the special joint recognition
for learned societies of South Korea. Participation statistics can be
reviewed in our
<a href="https://member-metrics.fly.dev" target="_blank">Labs Member
Metadata Metrics Tables</a>.

alt="A slide showing The scale of Crossref infrastructure including the following information: &gt;19,000 organisational members from 152 countries; &gt;40% self identify as institution- or university-based; &gt;150 million open metadata records with a DOI; 1.1 billion DOI resolutions every month; 000s (?) systems reusing metadata through search/API and 1.2 billion queries every month (up from 607mil in 2018); 150 Sponsor orgs; 50 Ambassadors; $1,150,000 on data storage and processing alone in 2024; 48 staff across 8 time zones and 11 countries" width="700"/>
</figure>
<p>
Since 2018 we’ve seen a 512% increase in the number of abstracts
included in the metadata; with Wiley’s recent addition of millions of
abstracts to their records largely contributing to this change. On the
relationships side, in the same period, we’ve noted a staggering 3004%
growth in preprint-to-article links, and we’re pleased to report a
growing number of funding relationships being made available thanks to
more and more funders registering Crossref DOIs for grants.
</p>
<p>
For those who couldn’t join us at such an early hour, Ed Penz included
some of these highlights in his own strategic update later in the day.
However, he focused on our activity and plans towards fulfilling our
four strategic goals:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
To contribute to an environment where the community identifies and
co-creates solutions for broad benefit
</li>
<li>
To be a sustainable source of complete, open, and global scholarly
metadata and relationships
</li>
<li>
To be publicly accountable to the Principles of Open Scholarly
Infrastructure (POSI) practices of sustainability, insurance, and
governance
</li>
<li>
To foster a strong team—because reliable infrastructure needs committed
people who contribute to and realise the vision, and thrive doing it
</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to these updates, we’ve heard from:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Izabela Szyprowska (OP, European Commission), Nikolaos Mitrakis (RTD,
European Commission), and Paola Mazzucchi (mEDRA) talked about the
process and rationale of implementing Crossref DOIs for grants at the
European Commission; and
</li>
<li>
Amanda French from ROR/Crossref about the new ‘ROR / Open Funder
Registry overlap’ tool.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We also assembled a diverse panel and invited the community to discuss
<strong>“What we still need to build a robust Research Nexus?”</strong>
The discussion ranged from how different parts of our community
currently use existing metadata, to how we can come together to make
improvements, especially in the area of standards and equitability, and
touched on metadata priorities. I’ll highlight some of the threads
below, but it’s certainly worth engaging with the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=7Nzk9wUQMJMdxffY&amp;v=d_u-Ad9-H64&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">full
recording of the discussion</a>, and offering your own perspective on
the Community Forum, commenting below.
</p>
<p>
Having participated in the whole day of talks, I found that a few themes
emerged as popular in the community: data citations, making it easier to
register metadata, making better use of metadata, retractions, and
equity of participation in the research nexus.
</p>
<h2 id="data-citations">
Data citations
</h2>
<p>
With the advances in the Crossref API relationships endpoint, Martyn
Rittman demonstrated how we’re now providing more comprehensive support
for data citations. You can follow his demonstration in the
<a href="https://community.crossref.org/t/relationships-endpoint-update-and-event-data-api-sunsetting/4214" target="_blank">Collab
Notebook</a> he used for the demo and shared for your perusal. He also
mentioned that the developments in this feature of our API will soon
replace the current service provided via the Events API. Feel free to
connect with Martin on the community forum and comment with questions
and suggestions.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned above, DataCite’s Iratxe Puebla mentioned the Make Data
Count initiative and the leaky pipeline of data citations we’ve got at
the moment in the scholarly literature, obscuring the true picture of
data reuse. This prevents the community from recognising and
incentivising data creation and reuse appropriately. One way of
addressing this is the Global Open Data Citation Corpus. Crossref and
DataCite collaborate closely in connecting and making that data
available.
</p>
<p>
Linking datasets, as well as software, was reported as part of the AGU
and CHORUS initiative in Enhancing Research Connections through
Metadata.
</p>
<p>
Data sharing and citing is as much a culture as a technology problem. As
Iratxe Puebla admitted, there are many norms and processes for capturing
and sharing that information,and DataCite is interested to hear about
different use cases. As highlighting data’s relationship with works is a
growing interest for our community, hopefully more understanding and
perhaps even commonality can be built soon.
</p>
<h2 id="making-it-easier-to-register-metadata">
Making it easier to register metadata
</h2>
<p>
As part of the Demonstrations session, we’ve seen two developments to
support members with registering their metadata more easily.
</p>
<p>
Crossref’s Lena Stoll shared plans for the new version of the Crossref
Registration Form, the helper tool for manual registration of metadata,
which translates the submission into XML, for inclusion in the Crossref
database. At the moment, the form only accepts grant registrations, but
it will be bolstered before the end of the year to include journal
articles then other content types in time.
</p>
<p>
Erik Hanson from PKP demonstrated the latest OJS version, commenting on
specific changes made in the new version in response to the key pain
points reported by users of the previous release.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we’ve heard of two independent projects by Martin Fenner
and Esha Data to enable metadata registration and Crossref DOIs for
scholarly blogs.
</p>
<h2 id="making-better-use-of-metadata">
Making better use of metadata
</h2>
<p>
Supported by the beginner’s demo of our REST API by Luis Montilla, there
were many voices about opportunities for making good use of Crossref’s
open metadata. Nikolaos Mitrakis of the European Commission talked about
the implementation of Crossref IDs for grants as a step towards tracing
and connecting the grants with not just academic but also societal
outcomes of the awards, and the plans for using those in the evaluation
and steering of their funding programmes.
</p>
<p>
Joann Fogleson of the American Society of Civil Engineers gave a buzzy
metaphor of publishers’ role in their work with metadata being
comparable with that of a pollinator – collecting the metadata at one
end, then registering, displaying and making it available to different
services, in order to enable a reacher scholarly environment for
discovery.
</p>
<p>
Many of the major themes have found their way to the discussion of what
is still needed to build a robust network of connections between
scholarly objects, institutions and individuals. One of the ways Ludo
Waltman of CWTS, Leiden University, intends to use our open metadata is
as part of the upcoming open-source version of the Laiden rankings and
he invited the community to contribute and help optimise this project to
provide an alternative to closed and selective databases.
</p>
<p>
Panellists also spoke of new opportunities in the light of data mining
and machine learning. Ran Dang, Atlantis Press, as a publisher shared a
concern about the standard of metadata across cultures and disciplines,
and the need to digitise past publications – which can then help better
leverage multi-lingual scholarship. Matt Buys of DataCite, pointed out
to the Global Data Citation Corpus they are developing, which leverages
a SciBERT model to pull out data citations, which is brought together
with Crossref/DataCite citation metadata.
</p>
<p>
Opening the data is essential to enabling its wider use, and here Ludo
gave the example of the fantastic outcome for references metadata, which
has been made open by default for the entire corpus of
Crossref-registred works. He hopes that this can inspire us to make
similar progress in other areas.
</p>
<p>
A little on a tangent with regards to metadata use, yet speaking of
excellent examples of the community making progress together, Ginny
pointed out <a href="http://ror.org" target="_blank">ROR</a>, how this
is becoming a new standard for solving a longstanding problem of
standardising affiliations metadata.
</p>
<h2 id="retractions">
Retractions
</h2>
<p>
Perhaps not entirely surprising, given the recent
<a href="https://doi.org/10.13003/c23rw1d9" target="_blank">acquisition
of the Retraction Watch database by Crossref</a> and making the data
openly available, retractions featured in a few different talks at the
meeting. First, Lena Stoll and Martin Eve from Crossref, shared how that
data can be accessed – that is as the csv file from
<a href="https://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?ginny@crossref.org" target="_blank">https://api.labs.crossref.org/data/retractionwatch?[your-email@here]</a>(add
your email as indicated), and the Crossref Labs API also displays
information about retractions in the /works/ route when metadata is
available. There are plans for incorporating this information with our
REST API in the future.
</p>
<p>
Ed and Ginny have shown stats for increases in retraction metadata
registered in Crossmark but commented on limited participation in
Crossmark overall. Recording retraction information in this way is still
important, alongside the Retraction Watch data, this allows for multiple
assertions of that information, and increases confidence in its
accuracy. We’re preparing to consult with the community at large about
the future direction of the Crossmark service, to make it easier to
implement and more useful for the readers.
</p>
<p>
Finally, Edilson Damasio from State University of Maringá-UEM, Brazil,
and a long-time Crossref Ambassador, presented the analysis of Brazilian
records in the Retraction Watch data, and he promises further analysis
to come, comparing the situation across geographies.
</p>
<h2 id="equity-of-participation-in-the-research-nexus">
Equity of participation in the research nexus
</h2>
<p>
Amanda Bartell opened the research nexus discussion with a reminder of
what that vision entails and pointing out commonality of goals in the
community – “Like others, Crossref has a vision of a rich and reusable
open network of relationships connecting research organisations, people,
things, and actions; a scholarly record that the global community can
build on forever, for the benefit of society. We call this
interconnected network the Research Nexus, but others in the community
have different names for it, such as knowledge graph or PID graph.”
</p>
<p>
The richness of this network depends upon the participation of all those
who produce and publish scholarship, so naturally the topic of equality
emerged in that discussion. In addition to Ran Dang’s concern for
multilingualism and digitisation of past publications from all parts of
the world, Mercury Shitindo of St Paul’s University, Kenya talked of the
need for more education, training and accessible resources for her
community, to be able to participate more effectively in this ecosystem.
She can see that affiliations and citations are of priority there, as
these enable transparency and facilitate collaborations. Matt Buys of
DataCite echoed her point, talking about the importance of the role of
contributors “It’s important not to lose sight of people and places – to
recognise the importance of contributor roles in the PID-graph”.
</p>
<p>
Earlier in the day, we mentioned the launch of our Global Equitable
Membership, or GEM programme. Since January, 110 new organisations from
eligible countries have joined Crossref fee-free. Ginny was quick to
admit that the need for a fee-waiver programme like this stems from the
regular fees schedule not being in tune with our global membership, and
she mentioned the upcoming fees review.
</p>
<p>
Financial barriers are often what get attention, yet reducing barriers
to participation with technology is equally important for building a
robust research nexus. With the planned changes to our registration
form, we’ll make it easier to register works for those who don’t
regularly use XML.
</p>
<p>
Johanssen Obanda took time to show the examples of community activity
and events organised by our global network of Ambassadors, and to thank
all our advocates and partners for their tireless work. They are also
helping tackle barriers, supporting our members to actively participate
in the research nexus with their metadata, and help enable the community
to make good use of the network of relationships that data denotes.
</p>
<p>
Showcasing our “One member one vote” truth, the Board election was the
focal point of the annual meeting, as always. We closed the ballot and
announced the results, with seven members selected to join the Board in
2024.
</p>

<p>
The event went very smoothly overall. Talks were delivered efficiently,
the panellists shared diverse perspectives and we elected our new Board
members. Huge thanks to Rosa Clark, our Communications and Events
Manager, who orchestrated the event and has been a constant
behind-the-scenes presence supervising the entire show. I’m grateful to
all colleagues at Crossref, who helped make it an enjoyable experience
and an informative event for our community. Finally – it wouldn’t be a
real meeting without the active participation of the speakers and
panellists, who shared their metadata stories, and even joined us for
some relaxed unplugged chats.
