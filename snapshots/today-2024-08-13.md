## On that two-hour convo between Trump and Musk

date: 2024-08-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Elon Musk made news yesterday during his conversation with former President Donald Trump, which live-streamed on X. In it, Musk advocated for reducing federal government spending and reducing deficits as a way of fighting inflation, and he angled for a role in the administration if Trump wins. Plus, what would it take to see an emergency interest rate cut? Then, A generally strong job market has led to economic improvements for people without higher levels of education.</p>

## Chrome iOS browser on Blink

date: 2024-08-13, from: OS News

Earlier this year, under pressure from the European Union, Apple was finally forced to open up iOS and allow alternative browser engines, at least in the EU. Up until then, Apple only allowed its own WebKit engine to run on iOS, meaning that even what seemed like third-party browsers &#8211; Chrome, Firefox, and so on &#8211; were all just Safari skins, running Apple&#8217;s WebKit underneath (with additional restrictions to make them perform worse than Safari). Even with other browser engines now being allowed on iOS in the EU, there&#8217;s still hurdles, as Apple requires browser makers to maintain two different browsers, one for the EU, and another one for the rest of the world. It seems the Chromium community is already working on bringing the Chromium Blink browser engine to iOS, but there&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done. A blog post by the open source consultancy company Igalia digs into the details, since they are contributing to the effort. While they&#8217;ve got the basics covered, it&#8217;s far from completed or ready for release. We’ve briefly looked at the current status of the project so far, but many functionalities still need to be supported. For example, regarding UI features, functionalities such as printing preview, download, text selection, request desktop site, zoom text, translate, find in page, and touch events are not yet implemented or are not functioning correctly. Moreover, there are numerous failing or skipped tests in unit tests, browser tests, and web tests. Ensuring that these tests are enabled and passing the test should also be a key focus moving forward. ↫ Gyuyoung Weblog I don&#8217;t use iOS, nor do I intend to any time soon, but the coming availability of browser engines that compete with WebKit is going to be great for the web. I&#8217;ve heard from so many web developers that Safari on iOS is a bit of a nightmare to support, since without any competition on iOS it often stagnates and lags behind in supporting features other browsers already implemented. With WebKit on iOS facing competition, that might change. Now, there&#8217;s a line of thought that all this will do is make Chrome even more dominant, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to be an issue. Safari is still the default for most people, and changing defaults is not something most people will do, especially not the average iOS user. On top of that, this is only available in the EU, so I honestly don&#8217;t think we have to worry about this any time soon, but obviously, we do have to remain vigilant.

## Harris faces misogyny, racism in bid for White House

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

Critics of Vice President Kamala Harris have used her gender as a cudgel, saying subtly and overtly that a woman cannot hold the most powerful job in the free world. Gender scholars say those railing against Harris have also chosen another line of attack: her race. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.

The next time there is a census in the United States in 2030, Americans who trace their ancestral roots to the Middle East and North Africa will have their own demographic category – MENA. VOA’s Genia Dulot went to the Little Arabia neighborhood of Anaheim, California, to see what people think about the change.

## on deciding not to read a book

<p>One thing I want to have before I ship Godot on iPad is the ability to publish your game to the AppStore.</p><p>I couldn’t find any OAuth-system for authenticating.  Looks like I must ask people to grab a token from their developer account and paste that before I can access Apple’s backends.</p><p>That seems very primitive.  Am I missing something?</p>

<p>The other challenge is just how many commands are available via right-click, or keyboard+mouse action.</p><p>None of that is going to work, so everything must be rerouted to some finger idiom.  </p><p>They will of course work with a keyboard/trackpad, but there should be no loss in access to features for people just holding their iPad without any additional hardware.</p>

<p>Last night at the New England Godot user group I did an impromptu talk on bringing Godot to the iPad.</p><p>One topic that I went on for a while was how the smaller screen display had forced me to either redesign or eliminate plenty of configurable options in Godot.</p><p>For starters, almost every Editor tunable option had been removed.  I didn’t see any reason to keep them.</p><p>Someone did point out “40 inch displays are barely enough space for me”.  Made me wonder of the sanity of the effort :-)</p>

The storm is expected to bring strong winds, heavy rain, flooding, and landslides to the islands before turning north toward Bermuda and possibly strengthening into a hurricane by Thursday. Forecasters don’t think Ernesto will make landfall on the U.S. mainland but said it could bring dangerous rip currents to the East Coast. This is the fifth named storm of the 2024 season and comes just a little over a week after Hurricane Debby struck Florida and swamped states along the southeast for several days.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">NOAA</small></p><p>Hurricane season started on June 1 and usually peaks in late August or early September. A few days ago the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/highly-active-hurricane-season-likely-to-continue-in-atlantic?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reiterated</a> its warning that this season could be one of the busiest on record. “Sea surface temperatures remain abnormally high, and La Niña is still expected to emerge during the hurricane season, so the time to prepare is now,” said Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center.</p><h3>2. Biden allows more tariff-free solar cell imports</h3><p>President Biden yesterday gave <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2024/08/12/a-proclamation-to-further-facilitate-positive-adjustment-to-competition-from-imports-of-certain-crystalline-silicon-photovoltaic-cells-whether-or-not-partially-or-fully-assembled-into-other-products-2/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the green light</a> to additional tariff-free imports of solar cells, more than doubling the volume allowed – from 5 GW to 12.5 GW. The move is an effort to support production for domestic panel makers and put Americans to work manufacturing clean energy tech. Somewhat relatedly, New Mexico’s Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced <a href="https://www.ebonsolar.com/news/30?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">recently</a> that Ebon Solar will build a $942 million solar cell factory in the state. The facility will create more than 900 jobs. New Mexico is also set to be home to the largest solar cell and panel factory in the country when Maxeon Solar Technologies gets its planned facility up and running. “While a huge number of solar panel factories are opening in the U.S., there’s still a dearth of domestic supply of earlier stages of the supply chain – including solar cells,” <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/08/12/new-mexico-solar-cell-factory/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a> Michelle Lewis at <em><em>Electrek</em></em>.</p><h3>3. Heatmap poll: Wildlife is top concern for Americans when it comes to renewable energy projects</h3><p><strong></strong>In case you missed it yesterday: <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/renewables-wildlife-impact?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener" target="_self">Exclusive Heatmap polling</a> conducted in April found the top concern both Democrats and Republicans have with renewable energy projects in their areas is the harm those facilities could inflict on wildlife. Notably, almost half of all Democrats said consequences for wildlife from projects would elicit “strong concern” from them. Other big concerns for Republicans such as reliability during extreme weather and land use factors received nowhere near the same level of Democratic agreement. The polling result underscores a real vulnerability that energy projects labeled “clean” can face when a would-be host community is faced with information indicating they may produce pollution or harm to the environment, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/renewables-wildlife-impact?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--WGkyQwYlke6goIEqe6j0InLVNeOgBhwkJaryK1q9KBQANSYC9VHJJsIAgNefEFR_Axmy2" rel="noopener" target="_self">wrote Heatmap’s Jael Holzman</a>. “These conflicts are real, I’m not going to say they aren’t. That’s why I say there are appropriate places to site and inappropriate places to site,” Matt Kirby, senior director of energy and landscape conservation for the National Parks Conservation Association, told Holzman. “I hope that industry understands that it needs to have social license to operate, and it will only be able to get that if they’re a good player.”</p><h3>4.

## “Left behind” Rust Belt workers have seen gains in recent years

date: 2024-08-13, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>An analysis from The Economist looks at people who feel &#8220;left behind&#8221; in America — those who got the short end of globalization and deindustrialization, people who took the biggest hits in recent decades from not having advanced education — and shows that that group has been seeing economic improvement under the Trump and Biden administrations. Plus, Harris and Trump look to nix federal taxes on tips, and consumers expect inflation to become less of a problem.</p>

## Millions of campaign dollars aimed at tilting school voucher battle are flowing into state races

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

NASHVILLE, Tenn.  — Millions of dollars are being spent this year to steer voters toward candidates for Republican-led Legislatures who not only support school vouchers, but will become key figures in implementing school choice programs in states across the U.S.


Most recently, national pro-voucher advocates declared victory after spending more than $4.5 million in Tennessee's primary election to defend and elect legislative candidates they claim will support school choice proposals in 2025 when state lawmakers are slated to return to the Capitol to enact policy.


Meanwhile, at least $14.8 million was spent by similar advocacy groups in the Texas primary election earlier in May to oust and replace voucher opponents. In Idaho, hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on candidates who both opposed and supported school vouchers in the rural mountain-west state.


The spending spree is backed by the nation's most high-profile voucher influencers, including the School Freedom Fund, a pro-voucher group tied to Club for Growth; the American Federation for Children, which was founded by former Trump administration Education Secretary Betsy DeVos; and Americans for Prosperity, the Koch family’s well-heeled free-market group.


Their focus is often on primary elections because in Republican-dominated states, primaries are seen as the most competitive hurdle to getting elected.


“Make no mistake — if you call yourself a Republican and oppose school freedom, you should expect to lose your next primary,” said David McIntosh, president of the School Freedom Fund, said in a statement shortly after Tennessee's primary election. “As we continue to hear from different governors, we plan on repeating our results from Tennessee and Texas across the country. The school freedom revolution is just beginning.”


Thirty-two states have implemented some sort of voucher program in the U.S., and some have been in place for decades, often with strict income requirements or narrowly tailored for students with disabilities.


Yet, over the years, there's been a noticeable push among Republican leaders to make available taxpayer-funded vouchers, or scholarships that can follow a child regardless of income to any public or private school. About a dozen states now have such programs. But proposals are being considered in many more, with varying degrees of legislative support.




Idaho, Tennessee and Texas all weighed sweeping school voucher proposals over the past year, but faced resistance not only from Democrats — who don’t hold as much political power — but also Republican members wary of directing public education dollars away from their districts.


Tennessee's Republican Gov. Bill Lee was forced to abandon his plans for universal school choice earlier this year after divisions inside the GOP-controlled Statehouse failed to come to a consensus on key specifics.


The failure prompted Lee to break with his previous stance of remaining quiet during GOP primary elections and instead publicly pick favorites this year in a handful of legislative races.


Additionally, outside groups like Club for Growth, American Federation for Children, Americans for Prosperity Action, and others poured $4.5 million across 16 House and Senate legislative races. Three of the open primaries saw almost a million dollars spent in each of the races.


Club for Growth spent the majority of the money, pouring $3.6 million across five races and ultimately winning four of those seats.


Lee didn't endorse any opponents of a sitting Republican incumbent, but he did throw support behind candidates in four open legislative seats — three of which were successful.


The modest gains for Lee's cause came at a big political cost.


After Lee endorsed Sen. Jon Lundberg, this year's voucher bill sponsor, former President Donald Trump backed Lundberg's opponent, Bobby Harshbarger, son of U.S. Rep. Diane Harshbarger. After Harshbarger was declared the winner, Trump swiped at Lee on social media, calling him a RINO, or “Republican in Name Only" even though he endorsed Lee in his 2022 reelection.


Lee has so far brushed aside the criticism, and instead released a statement declaring that Republican primary voters “sent a clear message: It’s time to deliver school choice for Tennessee families."


Focusing solely on primary voters may be a winning strategy to securing key state level races, but it comes at a cost of electing candidates who may not represent the average voter, said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University.


“A very small proportion of the Tennessee voting public is driving these outcomes, that's not good for democracy,” he said.


In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott also touted major wins for voucher advocates in the aftermath of the state's runoff primary election in May.


Months prior, back in late 2023, a group of House Republicans joined Democrats to help defeat a school voucher bill — delivering a blow to one of Abbott's top legislative priorities.


Similar to the playbook used in Tennessee, Abbott and national voucher groups pivoted to ousting voucher opponents in the primary election in order to secure a legislative victory in 2025.


Club for Growth ultimately took credit for removing 10 GOP incumbents who had opposed Abbott's voucher push after targeting 14 races in primary and runoff election. Club for Growth reported spending $8.8 million and Abbott spent at least $6 million between the primary and runoff elections.


“The Texas legislature now has enough votes to pass school choice," Abbott posted after the runoff election.


And in Idaho, four anti-school voucher Republican incumbents lost their reelection bids after the American for Children PAC spent more than $300,000 to promote school choice candidates.


During the 2022 election cycle, the organization spent $9 million on state legislative races to support school choice friendly candidates but CEO Tommy Schultz promised to spend “at least $10 million” this year.


“To date, AFC and its affiliates have deployed more than $9 million in state legislative primary elections across the country, and we will spend millions more in the general election to advance school choice policies for American families,” Schultz said in a statement to AP.

## IndieWeb Carnival: Rituals

date: 2024-08-13, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Ritual, <em>a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, actions, or revered objects.</em> Nothing in my life fits that definition.</p>
<p>That’s it, that was my entry for this month’s IndieWeb Carnival on the topic of Rituals. See you next month!</p>
<p>I’m just kidding. Well, I’m partly kidding. I’m serious when I say that I don’t have anything that fits that definition in my life. I’d love to, but I don’t. I’ve always been fascinated by rituals and strict routines. And believe me when I say that I tried to implement them in my life many many times before but always failed. I tried it with my meditation routine, with my reading habits, and with my sleeping schedule. Nothing sticks and introducing a ritual so far has been close to impossible. I don’t know why. I’m just bad at living a structured life even though I’d love to. But I think that’s mostly because I’m not really happy with the life I’m currently living and settling into a routine is hard when you know, deep down, that you want to change everything.</p>
<p>That said, rituals are awesome. There’s something deeply enjoyable in seeing someone performing something in a very ritualistic way. Which is why I always enjoyed things like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony">Japanese tea ceremony</a>. This idea of doing something the same way over and over again is very appealing to me. And who knows, maybe one day I’ll manage to do the same myself.</p>                <hr>
                <p>Thank you for keeping RSS alive. You're awesome.</p>

## 2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web

date: 2024-08-13, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1 id="2024-08-11-serving-bare-git-on-the-web">2024-08-11 Serving bare git on the web</h1>

<p>In the old days, I used <code>cgit</code> to render my git repositories on the web.
It&rsquo;s simple to set up since it&rsquo;s a CGI script.
This is ideal for URLs that get very few hits.
When nobody is requesting the URL, the CGI script isn&rsquo;t running and no resources are being used.
When a URL is requested, however, the CGI script loads, the interpreter loads, the libraries load, the script executes…
It&rsquo;s an expensive end-point!
And you know how it is.
The web is full of leeches and bad bots, crawlers and idiots.
Having an expensive end-point means it needs protection.</p>

<p>For I while I thought that <code>legit</code> was the answer.
It was nice and fast and all that.
But recently, <code>git clone</code> no longer worked.
It calls <code>git upload-pack</code> as an intermediate workaround for <a href="https://github.com/go-git/go-git/issues/1062">#1062</a>.
This was failing for some reason, however.
I tinkered with it for a while but didn&rsquo;t get anywhere.</p>

<p>Then I started thinking about <a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org">@Sandra</a>&rsquo;s post on <a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/hosting-git-repos">hosting git repos</a>.
I made some changes to my Apache config and now <code>git clone</code> works again.</p>

<p>The key is that you need a <code>post-update</code> hook that calls <code>git update-server-info</code>.
Each git repository already comes with a <code>post-update.sample</code> hook containing the necessary code, so I needed to loop over all the bare repositories I had and rename the example hook.</p>

<p>Using the Fish shell:</p>

<pre><code>for d in *.git
    sudo -u git mv $d/hooks/post-update.sample $d/hooks/post-update
end
</code></pre>

<p>Sadly, this is not good enough.</p>

<p>In order to generate an <code>index.html</code> file for every repository, I need a hook that regenerates it.
If you know how to determine whether regeneration can be skipped, I&rsquo;d love to hear how to that.</p>

<p>This hook also updates or adds the <code>AddDescription</code> lines I need.</p>

<p>I prepared a hook that I wanted to install in every repository and saved it as <code>~/post-update</code>.</p>

<p>This is what it looks like, using the Fish shell:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish

git update-server-info

# create index.html
set branch (git branch --show-current)
set template (cat /home/git/.readme.html | string collect)
set title (basename (pwd))
set body (git show $branch:README.md | cmark --to html | string collect)
printf &quot;$template&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &quot;$body&quot; &quot;$title&quot; &gt; index.html

# update description
set description (cat description)
sed --in-place=~ --expression &quot;/ $title/d&quot; /home/git/.htaccess
printf &quot;AddDescription \&quot;$description\&quot; $title\n&quot; &gt;&gt; /home/git/.htaccess
</code></pre>

<p>(I need the title twice, once for the title and once for the reminder on how to clone.)</p>

<p>I turn Markdown into HTML using <code>cmark</code>.
Common Mark is the closest we have to a standard, I guess.</p>

<p>The template <code>/home/git/.readme.html</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;format-detection&quot; content=&quot;telephone=no&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;%s&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
html { max-width: 70ch; padding: 1ch; margin: auto; }
body { hyphens: auto; }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;nav&gt;
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://src.alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;main&gt;
%s&lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;footer&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Clone&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;pre&gt;
&lt;mark&gt;git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/%s&lt;/mark&gt;
      &lt;/pre&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So now I needed to distribute the <code>post-update</code> hook to every repository and run it once.
I wrote yet another Fish script, <code>~/recreate-index</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/fish
for d in /home/git/*.git
    echo $d
    cd $d
    cp ~/post-update hooks/
    chown git:git hooks/post-update
    chmod 775 hooks/post-update
    sudo -u git git hook run post-update
end
</code></pre>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently hosting 95 repositories according to <code>ls -d /home/git/*.git | wc -l</code>.
Some of these don&rsquo;t have a <code>README.md</code> file.
Should I ever touch them again, I&rsquo;ll have to investigate.</p>

<p>Now, for the Apache web server – I changed my site to the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin alex@alexschroeder.ch
    ServerName src.alexschroeder.ch
    Include conf-enabled/blocklist.conf
    SSLEngine on
    DocumentRoot /home/git
   &lt;Directory /home/git&gt;
        Options Indexes
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>/home/git</code> directory has an <code>.htaccess</code> file that starts out containing the following:</p>

<pre><code>HeaderName .top.html
IndexOptions SuppressIcon SuppressSize FancyIndexing HTMLTable IgnoreCase
IndexOrderDefault Descending Date
IndexHeadInsert &quot;&lt;meta name=\&quot;viewport\&quot; content=\&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1\&quot;&gt;&quot;
IndexOptions Charset=UTF-8
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>.top.html</code> file contains a fragment to add to the top of the index:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
body { max-width: 80ch }
table { overflow-x: auto }
td { padding: 0.5ex 1em 0 0; white-space: nowrap }
td:nth-child(3) { white-space: wrap }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Source code repositories&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Hello!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  I'm Alex Schroeder.
  These are my source code repositories. You can find out more about me on
  &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/&quot;&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt;. There, you'll also find a page
  listing ways to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Contact&quot;&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  As for the git repositories, you should be able to clone them as they are.
  For example:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  git clone https://src.alexschroeder.ch/oddmu.git
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

<p><strong>2024-08-12</strong>. I wondered about links from the README to local files.
Right now, linking to images and files hosted in the same repository doesn&rsquo;t work since they don&rsquo;t exist in the raw repository.
The question then becomes, as far as I am concerned, whether this README is supposed to speak to developers or end-users?
If it is for developers, then pictures, screenshots, PDF files and all of that don&rsquo;t need to be linked from the repository.
If you are interested in these things, do a <code>git clone --depth 1</code> and investigate locally.</p>

<p>If the repository is for the end users, however, things are harder.
The <code>post-update</code> hook should extract all the local files linked to from the README.
Something like the following, perhaps:</p>

<pre><code>for file in (printf &quot;%s\n&quot; $body | /home/oddmu/oddmu links - | egrep -v '^(https?:|mailto:|/)')
    set dir (dirname $file)
    if test ! -d $dir
        mkdir -p $dir
    end
    echo $file; sudo -u git git show $branch:$file &gt; $file
end
</code></pre>

<p>This uses <a href="oddmu">oddmu</a> to extract the links from a Markdown file, creates the necessary directories and checks out the files.</p>

<p>But if the files are no longer linked from the README, they are not deleted.
If a directory is linked from the README (I have done this! 🤦), the checkout won&rsquo;t work.</p>

<p>I think the better way forward is to move this information elsewhere.
The README is not the documentation.</p>

<p>And with that, I think I did it! Serving git repositories from static files. A single directory per project containing the bare git data and a single <code>index.html</code> file. No more gazillion end points for crawlers to lose themselves.</p>

## Elon Musk interview of Trump marred by technical issues

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's interview with billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk finally got underway on Musk's social media platform X on Monday evening, following a lengthy delay caused by technical problems that kept many users from accessing the live stream.


Musk, who has endorsed Trump, began the event at 8:42 p.m., more than 40 minutes after the scheduled start time. He blamed the difficulties on a distributed denial-of-service attack, in which a server or network is flooded with traffic in an attempt to shut it down, though his claim was not confirmed.


More than 1.3 million people were listening about 45 minutes into the conversation, according to a counter on X.


Trump sought to turn the problems into a positive, congratulating Musk on the number of people trying to tune in.


The former president sounded at times as if he had a lisp, many listeners on X pointed out. Some said it made him sound like a cartoon character, others suggested it could be due to audio compression issues.


The technical issues recalled a similar event on X in May 2023, when Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suffered a chaotic start to his bid for the Republican presidential nomination due to glitches on the platform.


At the time, Trump mocked DeSantis on his own, social media platform, Truth Social. "My Red Button is bigger, better, stronger, and is working (TRUTH!)" Trump posted, "Yours does not."


Ahead of Monday's event, Musk had written: "Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight & tomorrow in advance of the conversation." X did not respond to requests for details or evidence of the alleged cyberattack.


Musk spent much of the early part of the interview lauding Trump for his bravery during the attempt on his life on July 13, when his ear was struck by a bullet.


Musk, the world's richest person, announced his support for Trump shortly after the shooting. He backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since.


Trump said he plans to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the attack, for a rally in October.


As the conversation unfolded, Trump delivered his usual mix of grievances, exaggerated claims and personal attacks, with Musk offering occasional encouragement.


Trump claimed without evidence that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if he were still president and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un — all authoritarian strongmen — as at the "top of their game."


He also expressed anger that Vice President Kamala Harris had been swapped in for Biden on the Democratic ticket.


"She hasn't done an interview since this whole scam started," Trump said, claiming falsely that Biden dropping off the ticket was a "coup." Trump had been leading Biden in many polls of battleground states likely to be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election but is now trailing Harris in some of the same states.


In an interview that was light on policy detail, Trump also appeared to praise Musk for firing workers.


"You're the greatest cutter. I mean, I look at what you do. You walk in, you just say: ‘You want to quit?’ They go on strike — I won't mention the name of the company — but they go on strike. And you say: 'That's OK, you’re all gone.'"


Trump back on X


The interview provided an opportunity for Trump to seize the limelight at a time when his campaign is facing new headwinds.


Harris has erased Trump's lead in opinion polls and energized Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies since she replaced Biden as the party's candidate three weeks ago. Her momentum could get another boost from the Democratic National Convention next week in Chicago.


Trump returned to X, formerly known as Twitter, with a series of posts on Monday for the first time in a year, reviving an account that had served as a main method of communication in previous campaigns and his four years in the White House, including his followers' Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.


Trump's access to his account, @realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Musk's ownership of X after being suspended by the platform's previous owners following the Jan. 6 attack, citing concerns he would incite violence.


Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social platform, which was launched in February 2022, but his posts there reach a much smaller audience than on X.


Musk backs Trump


Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla, has echoed Trump's false claims about voter fraud and Biden's immigration policies.


Musk has started an external super PAC spending group to support Trump's campaign. The political action committee is now under investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws on gathering voter information.


Trump, a longstanding critic of electric vehicles, shifted gears after Musk's endorsement.


"I'm for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly. So I have no choice," Trump said at an early August rally.


United Auto Workers President Shawn Fein, campaigning in support of Harris, called Trump a "sellout."


The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.


Republicans in Congress, including Trump's running mate Senator JD Vance, have opposed those subsidies.

## Judge rules RFK Jr. not a state resident, can't be on New York ballot

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

ALBANY, N.Y.  — A judge ruled Monday that independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name should not appear on New York's ballot, saying that he falsely claimed a New York residence on nominating petitions despite living in California.


Kennedy's lawyers quickly vowed to appeal ahead of the Aug. 15 deadline. If the judge's ruling is upheld, it would not only keep Kennedy off the ballot in New York but could also lead to challenges in other states where he used an address in New York City's suburbs to gather signatures.


The ruling came after a North Carolina judge decided earlier Monday that Kennedy can remain on that state's ballot following a separate challenge on different grounds.


Judge Christina Ryba, in her 34-page decision, said the rented bedroom Kennedy claimed as his home in the state wasn't a "bona fide and legitimate residence, but merely a 'sham' address that he assumed for the purpose of maintaining his voter registration" and furthering his political candidacy.


"Given the size and appearance of the spare bedroom as shown in the photographs admitted into evidence, the Court finds Kennedy's testimony that he may return to that bedroom to reside with his wife, family members, multiple pets, and all of his personal belongings to be highly improbable, if not preposterous," the judge wrote.


Ryba said evidence submitted in trial showed Kennedy had a "long-standing pattern" of borrowing addresses from friends and relatives so he could maintain his voter registration in New York State while actually residing in California.


"Using a friend's address for political and voting purposes, while barely stepping foot on the premises, does not equate to residency under the Election Law," the judge wrote. "To hold otherwise would establish a dangerous precedent and open the door to the fraud and political mischief that the Election Law residency rules were designed to prevent."


Clear Choice Action, the Democrat-aligned political action committee that backed the legal challenge, said the ruling makes it clear that Kennedy "lied about his residency and provided a false address on his filing papers and candidate petitions in New York, intentionally misleading election officials and betraying voters' trust."


The lawsuit, filed on behalf of several voters in the state, claims Kennedy's state nominating petition falsely listed a residence in well-to-do Katonah while actually living in the Los Angeles area since 2014, when he married "Curb Your Enthusiasm" actor Cheryl Hines.


Kennedy, who led a New York-based environmental group for decades and whose namesake father was a New York senator, argued during the trial that he has lifelong ties to New York and intends to move back.


During the trial, which ran for less than four days, Kennedy said he currently rents a room in a friend's home in Katonah, about 65 kilometers north of midtown Manhattan, though has only slept in that room once due to his constant campaign travel.


The 70-year-old candidate testified that his move to California a decade ago was so he could be with his wife, and that he always planned to return to New York.


Barbara Moss, who rents the room to Kennedy, testified that he pays her $500 a month. But she acknowledged there is no written lease and that Kennedy's first payment wasn't made until after the New York Post published a story casting doubt on Kennedy's claim that he lived at that address.


The judge also heard from a longtime friend of Kennedy's who said the candidate had regularly been an overnight guest at his own Westchester home from 2014 through 2017, but was not a tenant there as Kennedy had claimed.


Attorneys representing several New York voters grilled Kennedy in often heated exchanges as they sought to make their case, pointing to government documents including a federal statement of candidacy with a California address, and even a social media video in which Kennedy talks about training ravens at his Los Angeles home.


"Kennedy's testimony that none of the furniture, bedding and other decorative items in the spare bedroom belonged to him, as well as his testimony that his wife and family, his extensive book collection, and his wide assortment of domestic and exotic pets all remained in California, was further compelling evidence that Kennedy lacks the necessary physical presence and intent to remain" at the Katonah address, the judge wrote in her ruling.


Kennedy has the potential to do better than any independent presidential candidate in decades thanks to his famous name and a loyal base. Both Democrat and Republican strategists have expressed concerns that he could affect their candidate's chances.


Kennedy's campaign has said he has enough signatures to qualify in a majority of states, but his ballot drive has faced challenges and lawsuits in several.


Kennedy has told reporters that getting knocked off the ballot in New York could lead to lawsuits in other states where his campaign listed the same address.


After the trial ended Thursday, Kennedy argued that people who signed his petitions deserve a chance to vote for him.


"Those Americans want to see me on the ballot. They want to have a choice," he said.

## FBI investigating after Trump campaign says it was hacked by Iran

date: 2024-08-13, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The U.S. FBI said on Monday it was investigating after Donald Trump's presidential campaign said its internal communications were hacked and the campaign blamed the Iranian government.


The former president said on Saturday that Microsoft had informed his campaign that Iran had hacked one of its websites. Trump said Iran was "only able to get publicly available information."


The FBI is also investigating an alleged hack targeting advisers to the campaign of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, The Washington Post reported on Monday.


The FBI began the investigation in June, when Biden was still running for president, suspecting that Iran was behind the attempts to steal data from two U.S. presidential campaigns, the newspaper said, citing sources.


The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee after Biden withdrew his bid last month.


The Iranian government has denied that it hacked the Trump campaign.


Trump's campaign has pointed to a report on Friday by Microsoft researchers that indicated that Iranian government-linked hackers tried breaking into the account of a "high-ranking official" on a U.S. presidential campaign in June.


The report added that the hackers took over an account belonging to a former political adviser and then used it to target the official. It did not provide further details on the targets' identities.

## Site of deadliest church shooting in US history is torn down over protests

date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA

sutherland springs, texas  — Crews on Monday tore down a Texas church where a gunman killed more than two dozen worshippers in 2017, using heavy machinery to raze the small building even after some families sought to preserve the scene of the deadliest church shooting in U.S. history.


A judge cleared the way last month for the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs to tear down the sanctuary where the attack took place, which until now had been kept as a memorial. Church members voted in 2021 to tear it down, but some families in the community of less than 1,000 people filed a lawsuit hoping for a new vote on the building’s fate.


Authorities put the number of dead in the November 5, 2017, shooting at 26 people, including a pregnant woman and her unborn baby. After the shooting, the interior of the sanctuary was painted white and chairs with the names of those who were killed were placed there. A new church was completed for the congregation about a year and a half after the shooting.


John Riley, an 86-year-old member of the church, watched with sadness and disappointment as the long arm of a yellow excavator swung a heavy claw into the building over and over.


“The devil got his way,” Riley said, “I would not be the man I am without that church.”


He said he would pray for God to “punish the ones” who put the demolition in motion.


“That was God’s house, not their house,” Riley said.




For many in the community, the sanctuary was a place of solace.


Terrie Smith, president of the Sutherland Springs Community Association, visited often over the years, calling it a place where “you feel the comfort of everybody that was lost there.” Among those killed in the shooting were a woman who was like a daughter to Smith — Joann Ward — and Ward’s two daughters, ages 7 and 5.


Smith watched Monday as the memorial sanctuary was torn down.


“I am sad, angry, hurt,” she said.


In early July, a Texas judge granted a temporary restraining order sought by some families. But another judge later denied a request to extend that order, setting in motion the demolition. In court filings, attorneys for the church called the structure a “constant and very painful reminder."


Attorneys for the church argued that it was within its rights to demolish the memorial while the attorney for the families who filed the lawsuit said they were just hoping to get a new vote.


In the lawsuit, the plaintiffs alleged that some church members were wrongfully removed from the church roster before the vote was taken. In a court filing, the church denied the allegations in the lawsuit.


A woman who answered the phone at the church said Monday that she had no comment then hung up.


The man who opened fire in the church, Devin Patrick Kelley, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was chased by bystanders and crashed his car. Investigators have said the shooting appeared to stem from a domestic dispute involving Kelley and his mother-in-law, who sometimes attended services at the church but was not present on the day of the shooting.


Communities across the U.S. have grappled with what should happen to the sites of mass shootings. Last month, demolition began on the three-story building where 17 people died in the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, it was torn down and replaced.


Tops Friendly Markets in Buffalo, New York, and the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where racist mass shootings happened, both reopened. In Colorado, Columbine High School still stands, though its library, where most of the victims were killed, was replaced.


In Texas, officials closed Robb Elementary in Uvalde after the 2022 shooting there and plan to demolish the school.

## Earth hit by 'severe' solar storm

date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The Earth was hit Monday by an intense solar storm that could bring the Northern Lights to night skies farther south than normal, a U.S. agency announced. 


Conditions of a level-four geomagnetic storm — on a scale of five — were observed Monday from 1500 GMT, according to a specialized center at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 


These conditions may persist for several hours but were not expected to increase further in intensity, NOAA added in a statement. 


"A severe geomagnetic storm includes the potential for aurora to be seen faintly as far south as Alabama and northern California," NOAA said in a statement, referring to the two U.S. states. 


The new solar storm is caused by coronal mass ejections, which are explosions of particles leaving the sun. When these particles arrive on Earth, they disrupt the planet’s magnetic field. 


"There are a lot of auroras now. ... If it lasts until nightfall here, we might be able to see some," Eric Lagadec, an astrophysicist at the Cote d'Azur Observatory in France, said on X, formerly Twitter.  


On Sunday, NASA astronaut Matthew Dominick published on X a superb photo of the aurora borealis — or Northern Lights — taken from the International Space Station, where he is currently stationed. 


But solar or geomagnetic storms can also trigger undesirable effects.  


For example, they can degrade high-frequency communications, disrupt satellites and cause overloads on the electricity grid. Operators of sensitive infrastructure have been notified to put in place measures to limit these effects, NOAA said. 


In May, the planet went through the most powerful geomagnetic storms recorded in 20 years. They caused auroras to light up the night sky in the United States, Europe and Australia, at much lower latitudes than usual. 


This type of event has increased recently because the sun is currently close to its peak activity, as per its 11-year cycle.

## After Difficult and Emotional Trial, Cora Vides Is Convicted of Attempted Murder

## Pacific Northwest tribes battered by climate change but fight to get money meant to help them

date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA

SEATTLE — Coastal tribes in the Pacific Northwest experience some of the most severe effects of climate change — from rising seas to severe heat — but face an array of bureaucratic barriers to access government funds meant to help them adapt, a report released Monday found.


The tribes are leaders in combating climate change in their region. But a report by the Northwest Climate Resilience Collaborative says as tribes seek money for specific projects to address climate change repercussions, such as relocating a village threatened by rising waters, they often can't provide the matching funds that many grants require or the necessary staff or struggle with stringent application requirements. If they do get funding, it's often a small amount that can only be used for very specific projects when this work is typically much more holistic, the report found.


"Trying to do projects by piecing together grants that all have different requirements and different strings attached, without staff capacity is a challenge," Robert Knapp, environmental planning manager at the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe in northwest Washington, said in the report.


The collaborative, funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, spent two years holding listening sessions with 13 tribes along the Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington, the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Puget Sound. The communities face significant challenges from coastal flooding and erosion, rising stream temperatures, declining snowpack, severe heat events and increasing wildfire risk.


In addition to funding challenges, those interviewed also described not having enough staff to adequately respond to climate change as well as sometimes not being able to partner with state and local governments and universities in this work because of their remote locations. They also said it can be hard to explain to people who don’t live in their communities about the impact climate change has on the tribes.


But as they work to restore salmon habitats affected by warming waters or move their homes, funding gaps and complications were key concerns.




A representative from one anonymous tribe in the report said it was not able to hire a grant writer and had to rely on its biology department to navigate the maze of funding applications. Another talked about depending on 15 separate funders just to build a marina.


"This is a time of historic state and federal investment in climate action, and tribal priorities really need to be considered when making decisions around how we're going to be directing this investment," said Meade Krosby, senior author of the report.


"Hopefully this will help to inform how this work is being done, how these funds are being directed, so that they are actually responsive to the barriers that tribes are facing and helping to remove some of those barriers so the tribes can get the good work done."


The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.


Most of the tribes included in the report had completed publicly available reports on the impacts of climate change, and some had developed detailed plans for relocation as rising waters threaten buildings, or even entire villages.


The Quinault Indian Nation, in Washington's Olympic Peninsula, has a plan for relocating its largest village. The multimillion-dollar effort has relied on a piecemeal of federal and state grants and the constraints that come with them, Gary Morishima, Quinault's natural resources technical adviser, explained in the report.


Other tribes brought up concerns about competing against other tribal nations for funding when collaboration is such a vital part of responding to climate change. Tribal lands share borders and coastlines, and the impacts of climate change on those lands do not stop at any border, the report pointed out.


Amelia Marchand, citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation and another author of the report, explained that it comes down to the federal government fulfilling its trust responsibility to tribes.


"The treaty is supposed to support and uplift and ensure that what the tribes need for continued existence is maintained," she said. "And that's one of the issues with not having this coordinated federal response because different federal agencies are doing different things."


Millions of dollars have gone to coastal tribes, and the report said much more is needed. It referenced a 2020 Bureau of Indian Affairs report that estimated that tribes in the lower 48 states would need $1.9 billion over the next half-century for infrastructure needs related to climate change.


Amid all the challenges, Pacific Northwest tribes are still leaders in climate adaptation and have plenty to teach other communities, Marchand said.


"Finding ways to make their progress happen for their nations and their communities despite those odds is one of the most inspiring and hopeful resilient stories," she said.

## Apple forces Patreon to charge Patreons 30% tax, or have its iOS application banned from the App Store

date: 2024-08-12, from: OS News

I have no contracts, agreements, or business with Apple, I do not use any Apple products, I do not rely on any Apple services, and none of my work requires the use of any of Apple&#8217;s tools. Yet, I&#8217;m forced to deal with Apple&#8217;s 30% tax. Today, Patreon, which quite a few of you use to support OSNews, announced that Apple is forcing them to change its billing system, or risk being banned from the App Store. This has some serious consequences for people who use Patreon&#8217;s iOS application to subscribe to Patreons, and for the creators you subscribe to. First: Apple will be applying their 30% App Store fee to all new memberships purchased in the Patreon iOS app, in addition to anything bought in your Patreon shop. ↫ Patreon&#8217;s website First things first: the 30% mafia tax will only be applied to new Patreons subscribers using the Patreon iOS application to subscribe, starting early November 2024. Existing Patreons will not be affected, iOS or no. Anyone who subscribes through the Patreon website or Android application will not be affected either. Since creators like myself obviously have no intention of just handing over 30% of what our iOS-using supporters donate to us, Patreon has added an option to automatically increase the prices of subscriptions inside the Patreon iOS application by 30%. In other words, starting this November, subscribing to the OSNews Patreon through the iOS application will be 30% more expensive than subscribing from anywhere else. As such, I&#8217;m pondering updating the description of our Patreon to strongly suggest anyone wishing to subscribe to the OSNews Patreon to do so either on the web, or through the Patreon Android application instead. If you&#8217;re hell-bent on subscribing through the Patreon iOS application, you&#8217;ll be charged an additional 30% to pay protection money to Apple. And just to reiterate once more: if you&#8217;re already a Patreon, nothing will change and you&#8217;ll continue to pay the regular amounts per tier. Second: Any creator currently on first-of-the-month or per-creation billing plans will have to switch over to subscription billing to continue earning in the iOS app, because that’s the only billing type Apple’s in-app purchase system supports. ↫ Patreon&#8217;s website This is Patreon inside baseball, but as it stands right now, subscribers to the OSNews Patreon are billed on the first of the month, regardless of when during a month you subscribe. This is intentional, since I really like the clarity it provides to subscribers, and the monthly paycheck it results in for myself. Sadly, Apple is forcing Patreon to force me to change this &#8211; I am now forced to switch to subscription billing instead, somewhere before November 2025. This means that once I make that forced switch, new Patreons will be billed on their subscription date every month (if you subscribe on 25 April, you&#8217;ll be charged every 25th of the month). Luckily, nothing will change for existing subscribers &#8211; you will still be billed on the 1st of the month. This whole thing is absolutely batshit insane. Not only is Patreon being forced by Apple to do this at the risk of having their iOS application banned from the App Store, Apple is also making it explicitly impossible for Patreon to go any other route. As we all know, Patreon won&#8217;t be allowed to advertise that subscribing will be cheaper on the web, but Apple is also not allowing Patreon to remove subscribing in the Patreon iOS application altogether &#8211; if Patreon were to do that, Apple will ban the application from the App Store as well. And with how many people use iOS, just outright deprecating the Patreon iOS application is most likely going to hurt a lot of creators, especially ones outside of the tech sphere. Steven Troughton-Smith did some math, and concluded that Apple will be making six times as much from donations to Patreon creators than Patreon itself will. In other words, if you use iOS, and subscribe to a creator from within the Patreon iOS application, you will be supporting Apple &#8211; a three trillion dollar corporation &#8211; more than the most likely small creator you want to encourage to keep making content, art, or whatever. That is absolutely, balls-to-the-wall, batshit insanity. Remember that ad Apple made where it crushed a bunch of priceless instruments and art supplies into an iPad &#8211; the ad it had to pull and apologise for because creators, artists, writers, and so on thought it was tasteless and dystopian? Who knew that ad was literal.

## Haiku gets tentative Firefox port

Haiku, the platform grossing in ported browsers while its native WebPositive browser languishes, has added another notch to its belt &#8211; and this time, it&#8217;s a big one. Firefox has been tentatively ported to Haiku, but it&#8217;s early days and there&#8217;s no package ready to download &#8211; you&#8217;ll have to compile it yourself if you want to get it running. It&#8217;s version 128, so it&#8217;s the latest version, too. Without the ability to easily test and run it, there&#8217;s not much more to add at this point, but it&#8217;s still a major achievement. I hope there&#8217;ll be a nice Haiku package soon.

## Microsoft deprecates Paint 3D

date: 2024-08-12, from: OS News

Way back in the early before time, Microsoft thought it would be a good idea to brand Windows 10 entirely around the label &#8220;creators&#8221;, and one distinctly odd consequence of that was an application called &#8220;Paint 3D&#8221;, a replacement for the traditional Paint application that Microsoft had been shipping one way or another since 1985, when it included a simple bitmap editing program called &#8220;Doodle&#8221; with its mouse drivers for DOS. Doodle would be replaced shortly after by a whitelabel version of ZSoft Corporation&#8217;s PC Paintbrush, and once Windows 1.0 rolled around, it was rebranded as Paint, a name that has stuck until today. Paint 3D was supposed to replace the regular Paint, with a focus on creating and manipulating 3D objects, serving as an extension to Microsoft&#8217;s failed efforts to bring VR and AR to the masses. Microsoft even went so far as to list the regular Paint as deprecated, but after a lot of outcry, has since reneged and refocused its efforts on improving it. Paint 3D, however, is not officially going to be deprecated, and has been added to Microsoft&#8217;s list of deprecated Windows features. Paint 3D is deprecated and will be removed from the Microsoft Store on November 4, 2024. To view and edit 2D images, you can use Paint or Photos. For viewing 3D content, you can use 3D Viewer. ↫ Microsoft&#8217;s list of deprecated Windows features I don&#8217;t think anyone is going to shed a tear on this, but at the same time, as with everything Microsoft changes or removes from Windows, there&#8217;s bound to be at least a few people whose entire workflow heavily depends on Paint 3D, and they&#8217;re going to be pissed.

## Americans’ Top Concern About Renewable Energy Projects

date: 2024-08-12, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzE1ODY3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MTE5NzI0NX0.yZq36xubKOubJ-nVNKM7KfUBhkndk2vRL0gvLGN1bF8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Renewable energy’s biggest political liability? It may be the whales and tortoises, according to Heatmap polling. </p><p>Conflicts over the environmental impacts of energy transition technologies — some rooted in fact, others founded more in fear — have played out in myriad ways across America over the past few years, from residents of beach towns protesting against offshore wind in the name of whale safety to farm communities opposing solar and onshore wind over impacts to livestock and birds. While some of these fights have been seeded by anti-renewable interest groups, these outside actors have fertile soil to work with. Exclusive Heatmap polling conducted in April found the top concern both Democrats and Republicans have with renewable energy projects in their areas is the harm those facilities could inflict on wildlife. </p><p>Notably, almost half of all Democrats said consequences for wildlife from projects would elicit “strong concern” from them. Other big concerns for Republicans such as reliability during extreme weather and land use factors received nowhere near the same level of Democratic agreement. </p><p>It’s hard to say whether this is because people are really concerned about animals and species protection generally or because there’s a concerted public relations effort (funded in no small part by <a href="https://energyandpolicy.org/fossil-fuel-funding-anti-offshore-wind-ads/" target="_blank">fossil fuel companies</a>) to focus on the negative environmental effects of solar farms and wind turbines. But nevertheless, this polling result — which is being reported today for the first time — underscores a real vulnerability that energy projects labeled “clean” can face when a would-be host community is faced with information indicating they may produce pollution or harm to the environment. </p><p>It also helps explain a recent statewide poll of New Jersey residents conducted by researchers at Stockton University that found a sharp increase in the percentage of respondents opposed to offshore wind following a very public campaign to tie new offshore project development to a spate of whale deaths. </p><p>“These conflicts are real, I’m not going to say they aren’t. That’s why I say there are appropriate places to site and inappropriate places to site,” Matt Kirby, senior director of energy and landscape conservation for the National Parks Conservation Association, told me. “I hope that industry understands that it needs to have social license to operate, and it will only be able to get that if they’re a good player.” </p><h3>The Jersey campaign</h3><p>How this played out in New Jersey should be cause for concern to anyone trying to deploy more renewable energy. </p><p>In 2019, researchers at Stockton, a public university in the state, found broad bipartisan support for offshore wind development. Then came at least a dozen <a href="https://abc7ny.com/climate-change-dead-whale-beached-tri-state-area/12901186/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dead whales</u></a> that washed onto the Atlantic coastline, an incident that lacks a known cause to this day … but also spurred a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/19/whales-offshore-wind-farms-00100396" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>non-stop anti-offshore wind campaign</u></a> driven <a href="https://www.thefisherman.com/article/rep-van-drew-launches-congressional-investigation-into-offshore-wind-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by politicians</u></a> and <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-rapidly-escalating-its-anti-offshore-wind-campaign" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>political media figures</u></a>, including those with ties to <a href="https://grist.org/politics/republicans-fossil-fuels-the-gop-donors-behind-a-growing-misinformation-campaign-to-stop-offshore-wind/" target="_blank">fossil fuel-funded opposition groups</a>. </p><p>There’s been no evidence to date that the offshore wind build-out off the Atlantic coast has harmed a single whale. But studies have shown that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-13/wind-farm-impacts-on-whale-habitat-is-still-a-mystery-scientists-say" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>activities</u></a> related to offshore wind <em><em>could </em></em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-29/endangered-whales-at-risk-from-offshore-wind-us-scientist-warns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>harm a whale</u></a>, which appears to be enough to override the benefits for some people. When Stockton pollsters <a href="https://stockton.edu/news/2023/windmill-support-drops-hughes-poll.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>checked again</u></a> in September 2023 to measure support for offshore wind, they found it had plummeted. More state residents supported wind farms than opposed them, still. But support had dropped 30%, to roughly half of all participants backing the projects. Only a third of those living on the coasts were for constructing new offshore wind. </p><p>Alyssa Maurice, one of the researchers involved in the recent poll, told me there’s multiple ways to read this data, including that it may have been driven by partisanship. The whale campaign had a lot of play <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-approves-massive-wind-farm-amid-rising-whale-death-toll" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on Fox News</u></a> (and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservative-groups-cleared-continue-legal-fight-protect-whales-biden-backed-offshore-wind-farm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>still does today</u></a>). But there’s a very real chance the campaign to tie the whale deaths and other potential environmental harms to offshore wind worked: Nearly 44% of respondents said they believed offshore wind would impact marine life “a great deal,” a figure that rose to 62% when it came to people on the coast. </p><p>“There’s now this gap between shore communities and the state that wasn’t there before,” Maurice said. “[It’s] a really stark geographic divide.” </p><h3>Climate vs. environment</h3><p>Climate change is a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-moving-endangered-species-188dc7a881cef6766d63f20bfabefdfb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>major risk</u></a> to wildlife habitat and imperiled species across the world — that much is plain as day. There’s a reason the survival of certain <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/the-polar-bear-more-than-a-poster-child/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mammals</u></a>, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/no-more-delta-smelt-the-delta-tunnel-project-threatens-their-extinction-for-good/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fish</u></a> and <a href="https://www.nwf.org/Garden-for-Wildlife/About/Native-Plants/keystone-plants-by-ecoregion" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fauna</u></a> often described as “keystone species” are seen as bellwethers for planetary warming. When they go extinct from climate impacts to river temperatures or food availability, it portends harms that may befall other species too — including, maybe, humans. </p><p>But an unfortunate truth is that major industrial projects — even ones aimed at decarbonizing the global economy — will always impact the local environment. To build <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/03/21/solar-power-project-threatens-prime-desert-tortoise-habitat-conservationists-warn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>large-scale solar farms</u></a> or <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/howardcenter/lithium/stories/lithium-liabilities.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lithium mines</u></a> or sprawling CO2 pipelines, we may need to disrupt a substantial number of endangered species and their habitat, not to mention the livelihoods of countless people who make their livelihoods off the land, air, and sea, or who enjoy outdoor recreation and hunting. </p><p>These conflicts are the reason <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/18042024/inside-clean-energy-transition-terminology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>I gave</u></a> a talk at the Society of Environmental Journalists’ conference this year explaining why I do not use the term “clean energy” without quotation marks — not for the derisive reasons climate deniers put scarequotes around the term, but in pursuit of accuracy and out of respect for the populations most impacted by new projects. Before I joined Heatmap, I spent years <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/how-much-mining-is-needed-to-save-the-planet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writing about</u></a> mining for <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/lack-of-graphite-could-gum-up-american-ev-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>battery metals</u></a>, and I heard countless complaints from individuals in frontline communities and human rights groups about how there’s nothing “clean” about a car made with cobalt <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/cobalt-poses-human-rights-test-for-biden-on-clean-energy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mined by a child</u></a> or lithium chemicals that sapped <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/facing-water-stress-chiles-lithium-industry-under-scrutiny-in-atacama-desert/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an aquifer dry</u></a>. </p><p>That’s not to say focusing on the “clean” part of decarbonization is a bad thing — it’s just not what brings people together, according to the Heatmap poll. In fact, we found the most bipartisan agreement for supporting “clean” energy projects in two areas: job creation and reducing the nation’s dependence on foreign sources for oil and gas. </p><p>Reducing local air and water pollution? There was a 52 percentage point difference in support between Democrats and Republicans, with only a third of GOP respondents identifying it as a major driver of support. Combating climate change? That gulf widens to 66 percentage points, with only 16% GOP support. </p><p>Whether those who favor overlooking wildlife concerns in favor of deployment like it or not, these findings undergird an argument being made by the ecologically-focused segments of the climate advocacy world that planning through the transition can have a political upside. </p><p>Patrick Bigger, a senior researcher at the left-aligned Climate and Community Project, said he wasn’t surprised by Heatmap’s findings. </p><p>“Talking about conservation polls really well and talking about climate change polls really poorly” with some communities, Bigger said. “I think there’s this implicit sense by folks who care about climate action that clean and green are permanently symbiotically coded as good, and it’s very hard to break that habit until you’re confronted with the polling that this doesn’t actually play well with the communities you’re trying to reach.” </p>

## US to resume sales of 'offensive' weapons to Saudi Arabia

date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States said Monday it would resume sales of offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia, ending a yearslong suspension triggered by the kingdom's bloody operations in Yemen. 

 

With Saudi Arabia once again seen as a pivotal player for the United States as the Gaza war enters its 10th month, the State Department said it would return to weapons sales "in regular order with appropriate congressional notification and consultation." 

 

"Saudi Arabia has remained a close strategic partner of the United States, and we look forward to enhancing that partnership," State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters. 

 

President Joe Biden took office in 2021 pledging a new approach to Saudi Arabia that emphasizes human rights and immediately announced that the administration would only send "defensive" weaponry to the longtime U.S. partner. 

 

The step came after thousands of civilians were estimated to be killed in Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen, including children, in a campaign against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who have taken over much of the country. 

 

But geopolitical considerations have changed markedly since then. The United Nations, with U.S. support, brokered a truce in early 2022 that has largely held. 

 

Since the truce, "there has not been a single Saudi airstrike into Yemen and cross-border fire from Yemen into Saudi Arabia has largely stopped," Patel said. 

 

"The Saudis since that time have met their end of the deal, and we are prepared to meet ours," Patel said.

washington  — Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is due to interview Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on the X social media network on Monday in an event that could inject more surprises into the turbulent U.S. presidential election.


The interview, scheduled for 8 p.m. Eastern Time (0000 Tuesday GMT), could provide the former president an opportunity to seize the limelight at a time when his campaign is seen as sagging.


His Democratic rival for the Nov. 5 election, Vice President Kamala Harris, has erased Trump's lead in opinion polls and energized Democratic voters with a series of high-energy rallies.


The interview on Musk's social media platform could allow Trump to reach a different audience than the conservative faithful who attend his rallies and watch his interviews on Fox News. However, similar events on the platform have been plagued by technical problems.


"Am going to do some system scaling tests tonight & tomorrow in advance of the conversation," Musk wrote on the platform, formerly known as Twitter.


The interview will be hosted live using Trump's official X account, his campaign said on Sunday. Trump's access to his account, @realDonaldTrump, was restored a month into Musk's ownership of X after being suspended by the platform's previous owners following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Congress by his supporters.


Trump frequently posts on his Truth Social social media platform, which was launched in February 2022. On Monday morning, Trump returned to X for the first time in a year, posting an ad that highlighted his claim that the four criminal prosecutions he faces are politically motivated.


His last X post before Monday was one in August 2023 appealing for donations and showing a mug shot after he was booked at an Atlanta jail in relation to felony charges tied to his attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat in Georgia.


Musk could prove to be an unusual interviewer. The world's richest person backed Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020 but has tacked rightward since and endorsed the Republican following the attempted assassination of Trump in July.


Musk, who heads electric car company Tesla, also started a fundraising organization to support Trump’s campaign. The political action committee is now under investigation in Michigan for possible violations of state laws on gathering voter information.

Trump, a longstanding critic of electric vehicles, shifted gears after Musk's endorsement.


"I'm for electric cars. I have to be, because Elon endorsed me very strongly. So I have no choice," Trump said at an early August rally.

United Auto Workers President Shawn Fein, campaigning in support of Harris, called Trump a "sellout."


The Biden administration has worked to popularize electric vehicles through tax breaks and other support as part of its broader goal of reducing carbon emissions blamed for climate change.


Republicans in Congress have opposed those subsidies. Senator JD Vance, Trump's vice presidential running mate, said the Biden policy merely subsidizes rich people who purchase the cars.


Advertisers have fled X since Musk bought it in 2022 and subsequently reduced content moderation that has resulted in a dramatic increase in hate speech, civil rights groups have said.


In the meantime, the entrepreneur has been involved in a swirl of additional controversies. He has falsely accused Biden and the Democratic Party of opening U.S. borders to undocumented immigrants in a ploy to boost the number of potential Democratic voters. Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections.


Musk in November 2023 endorsed an antisemitic post on X that said members of the Jewish community were stoking hatred against white people. He defended himself, saying the user was speaking “the actual truth.” Musk has also attacked the Anti-Defamation League, a nonprofit that works to fight antisemitism, accusing it, without evidence, of being responsible for a drop in advertising on X.

## That One Nice Week of August Is Here

	I come bearing good news for a change: Most of the United States will see reasonable summer temperatures this week! With, of course, a few exceptions …
</p><h3>Debby brings cooler days across the country </h3><p>
	Hurricane Debby, which first made landfall in Florida last Tuesday, has set new weather trends in motion. After hitting Georgia and South Carolina, the storm continued north, reaching the Northeast last Friday. The wind and rainfall brought cooler, less humid air into the region, Reneé Duff, senior meteorologist at Accuweather, told me. 
	<strong>Temperatures in the Northeast — which were several degrees below historical averages this weekend — will continue to be more comfortable this week compared to the recent past.</strong> Same goes for the northern Plains and Midwest.
</p><p>
	In the Southeast, where the hurricane has caused the most destruction, temperatures will be near their historical averages — around the low 90s degrees Fahrenheit. While the cool-off will be good for those trying to recover after the storm, Duff told me that higher humidity levels with rounds of showers and thunderstorms in the region may still end up slowing cleanup efforts.
</p><center><iframe aria-label="Map" data-external="1" frameborder="0" height="624" id="datawrapper-chart-dbaWT" scrolling="no" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dbaWT/2/" style="border: none;" title="Hot and Cold" width="680"></iframe></center><p>
	Despite Debby, the heat has found a way to stick itself to some states. 
	<strong>Parts of Texas and New Mexico will see temperatures much higher than those expected for this time of the year</strong>, Tom Kines, senior meteorologist at Accuweather, told me.<strong> </strong>During the later part of the week, an intense heat wave will build across Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas. On Thursday, southern Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama will be under extreme heat risk alerts, according to <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/heatrisk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>data</u></a> from the National Weather Service.<strong> </strong>
</p><p>
	The rest of the country should “experience temperatures close to where they should be for this time of year,” Kines told me.
</p><h3>More updates on the Park Fire </h3><p>
	Little progress has been made on containing the Park Fire since last week. 
	<strong>The wildfire, which is now 38% contained, continues to grow aggressively. </strong>Climate scientist Daniel Swain of the University of California, Los Angeles, explained in a live briefing Thursday that while parts of the fire that had been burning through grass have been contained, in its northeastern flank, the fire is currently ravaging through timber plantations which burn more violently than natural forests. The fire has now also reached the Lassen National Forest, burning over 100,000 acres of the protected area.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Some useful numbers:</strong> Ranking directly above the Park Fire among the largest wildfires in California’s history (for the moment) is the Mendocino Complex Fire of July 2018, which burned around 460,000 acres, but lasted <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2018/7/27/ranch-fire-mendocino-complex" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>161 days</u></a>. The Park Fire has already scorched almost 430,000 acres in less than 20 days. The largest fire in California’s history was the 2020 August Complex fire, which devoured more than a million acres over 87 days.  </li>
</ul><p>
	There is one tiny bit of good news: According to 
	<a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2024/7/24/park-fire" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>updates</u></a> from Cal Fire, <strong>firefighters have been able to lift evacuation orders and warnings in Butte County</strong>.
</p><p>
	Meanwhile, other wildfires have continued to pop up in California. On Tuesday, the Crozier Fire started in El Dorado County, and almost 2,000 acres have so far been burned. While not as powerful as the Park Fire, Crozier is also growing fast and in a more densely populated area, Swain said.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> The heat wave in California has broken, with near average — and maybe even lower — temperatures in store this week. The only issue is that the cooler weather comes from stronger winds, which are not ideal for containing a wildfire. <strong>Despite more forgiving temperatures, wildfire risk will remain high in California for the foreseeable future. </strong></li>
</ul><h3>Alaska has been super weird </h3><p>
	In late July, an especially long and intense heat wave settled over Alaska. On July 22, Fairbanks hit 90 degrees, breaking the previous record of 89 set last year.
	<strong> On that day, it was hotter in northern Alaska than it was in Atlanta.</strong>
</p><p>
	The fact that such high temperatures are being seen so late into the summer in Alaska is particularly concerning, Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist for the NWS, 
	<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/alaskan-heat-wave-will-send-temperatures-soaring-to-90-degrees-f/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told</u></a> <em><em>Scientific American</em></em>. Peak temperatures usually happen much sooner, in June; by July, after the summer solstice, Alaska gets fewer hours of sunlight, so temperatures should start settling down. Alaskans’ housing and habits are all adapted to keep the cold away, so scientists are worried about the health risks of prolonged high temperatures in the state.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> While temperatures in Alaska dipped below average this weekend in the central and southern parts of the state, the mercury will soon start rising again. <strong>“If there is more record-breaking heat, the middle of the month would be the most likely time frame,” Duff told me. </strong>The possibility of record-breaking heat will decrease again starting at the end of August, but temperatures will continue to be warmer than average in the northern part of the state. </li>
</ul><h3>A heat wave in South Korea is killing livestock by the thousands </h3><p>
	East Asian countries have been sizzling this summer, and South Korea is no exception. Following the end of the monsoon season in late July, Seoul has constantly seen temperatures of 89 degrees and up. Most of the country has seen temperatures 10 degrees higher than historical averages. 
	<strong>The relentless heat has led to almost </strong><a href="https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2024/08/south-korea-high-temperatures-forecast-across-most-of-the-country-through-at-least-aug-19-update-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>2,000 heat-related illnesses and 17 fatalities</strong></u></a><strong> since the start of the summer. </strong>In some regions, including Jeju, people are struggling to keep livestock alive, for example using fans and air conditioners to try to cool down the island’s rare black pigs. Over <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/south-korea-boils-in-summer-heat-that-may-set-new-records" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>300,000</u></a> livestock have died since mid-July.
</p><p>
	“The heat is mostly due to a persistent area of high pressure over the Philippine Sea with the high's axis reaching to the Korean Peninsula over the past week to 10 days,” Duff explained.
</p><p>
	The country has opened 
	<a href="https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2024/08/south-korea-high-temperatures-forecast-across-most-of-the-country-through-at-least-aug-19-update-2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>50,000 cooling shelters</u></a> in response to the heat crisis, on top of smaller-scale counter-measures such as distributing umbrellas and salt tablets to try to keep people cool and hydrated.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Looking Ahead: Despite some cloudiness and rain this past Friday, the scorching heat will prevail this week in the country.</strong> “A better chance for relief from the heat may come late next week or early the week of August 19,” Duff told me.</li>
</ul><h3>Extreme heat in northern Canada is making some miss the winter </h3><p>
	Several communities in northern Canada broke heat records last week. Temperatures 
	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/08/canada-arctic-region-heat-wave" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reached</u></a> 95 degrees, breaking the record of 91 set last year. Inuvik, which saw its second ever recorded heat wave this summer, has been especially vulnerable to the recent heat. The region’s famous midnight sunsets means heat takes longer to dissipate, exacerbating the issues with low water levels in the Mackenzie River. Due to the dry and hot conditions, the community so used to ice and snow is now concerned about wildfires. Regions in Canada that have been historically shielded from major fire threats have been in the line of destruction in recent years, <em><em>The Guardian</em></em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/09/canada-wildfire-record-climate-crisis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>.
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong> In Inuvik, temperatures will stay below 68 degrees for most of this week. While it seems like record-breaking heat is now behind northern Canada, it’s harder to say when drought conditions might improve. At least in the next 10 days, heavy precipitation is not predicted for the Northwest Territories. </li>
</ul><h3>Research corner:</h3><ul>
<li>Over 70% of the global workforce is at risk from extreme heat-related death and injuries, according to a United Nations <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/unsg_call_to_action_on_extreme_heat_for_release.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a> — that’s almost 2.5 billion workers. While Africa leads as the region with the highest percentage of vulnerable workers, the report also points out that the number of those vulnerable in Europe is growing at the fastest rate. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>In Montana, Missoula County first responders teamed up with researchers at the University of Montana to investigate the most vulnerable group to extreme heat. After going through 911 calls, they <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/08/07/rural-seniors-heat-wave-montana/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a> that those living in rural areas — which also tends to have older populations — were the ones that required most assistance during periods of intense heat. They also found that every 1 degree Celsius increase in average daily temperatures led to a 1% increase in 911 activity, i.e. hundreds of additional distress calls. 
	</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
	A 
	<a href="https://apnews.com/article/electricity-bill-air-conditioning-64f1d13bbb6d3523a6cc31d0b4fb14af" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">poll</a> from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed that seven in 10 Americans have seen the impact of extreme heat on their electricity bills in the past year. In the past five years, according to the survey, 70% of Americans have been personally affected by extreme heat. Those in the West and South were more likely to report having been impacted by the hot weather than those in the Northeast.

<p>A recent survey shows a slightly larger percentage of Americans trust Vice President Kamala Harris to handle the economy over former President Donald Trump. It’s the first time the poll has found the Democratic nominee leading Trump on economic issues this year. We&#8217;ll dig in. Then, what are forecasters expecting from this week&#8217;s inflation readings? And we&#8217;ll also hear about temp gigs and the youth unemployment rate.</p>

Some of the projects facing delays are a $1.3 billion lithium refinery in South Carolina, a $1 billion solar panel factory in Oklahoma, and LG Energy Solution’s $2.3 billion battery storage facility in Arizona. The companies point to a combination of factors, including overproduction of clean tech from China, macroeconomic pressures, policy confusion, and a drop in EV demand. “Everybody’s running into higher-than-expected costs just because of labor and supply chain,” said Craig MacFarland, mayor of Casa Grande, Arizona, where a semiconductor facility has been delayed by two years.

Businesses are “wary of the event’s location and logistics, the oil-evangelizing autocratic regime running it and, perhaps most notably, the prospect of Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election just days before the November summit begins.” Anticipation is already growing for next year’s event in Brazil, where countries will be expected to submit their new and updated climate plans, or <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/all-about-ndcs?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_hLSHcogNE7YXM0zUoiKmxGZjrVaemVY-D4EWIJM1qsg7Wn0rSiR7wYD0h-oJ-NYCXwt_z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">nationally determined contributions</a>, which will outline how they plan to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts.

</p><h3>4. Researchers create thin film that could turn almost anything into a solar-power surface</h3><p>
	Researchers at Oxford University have <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-08-09-solar-energy-breakthrough-could-reduce-need-solar-farms?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_hLSHcogNE7YXM0zUoiKmxGZjrVaemVY-D4EWIJM1qsg7Wn0rSiR7wYD0h-oJ-NYCXwt_z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">created</a> a new solar power-generating material that “is thin and flexible enough to apply to the surface of almost any building or common object.” The new perovskite film, which Tina Casey at <em><em>CleanTechnica</em></em> <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2024/08/09/sheer-chaos-as-paint-on-perovskite-solar-cells-take-over/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_hLSHcogNE7YXM0zUoiKmxGZjrVaemVY-D4EWIJM1qsg7Wn0rSiR7wYD0h-oJ-NYCXwt_z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">called</a> a “paint-on solar cell,” matches the energy efficiency performance of a traditional single-layer silicon PV and is almost 150 times thinner than a modern silicon wafer. Could this replace silicon-based solar panels altogether? Not anytime soon, Casey wrote, but it could turn almost anything into a solar surface. “We can envisage perovskite coatings being applied to broader types of surfaces to generate cheap solar power, such as the roofs of cars and buildings and even the backs of mobile phones,” said Dr. Junke Wang, a Marie Skłodowska Curie Actions Postdoc Fellow at Oxford University Physics. “If more solar energy can be generated in this way, we can foresee less need in the longer term to use silicon panels or build more and more solar farms.”</p><h3>5. Study: Older trees grow more wood to absorb rising CO2 emissions</h3><p>
	Mature trees appear to be able to respond to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by increasing the amount of the greenhouse gas they can absorb.

The added wood locks away the gas for decades. The study is only about half-way done and will continue through 2031, but the researchers hope the initial results demonstrate the power of mature forests to act as a natural climate solution. “This is evidence in favor of careful management of established forests,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1d7p0n1e3ro?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_hLSHcogNE7YXM0zUoiKmxGZjrVaemVY-D4EWIJM1qsg7Wn0rSiR7wYD0h-oJ-NYCXwt_z" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Rob MacKenzie, director of Birmingham Institute of Forest Research and one of the study’s authors. “The old forest is doing a huge amount of work for us.

## From Paris to Los Angeles: How the city is preparing for the 2028 Olympics

date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA

Los Angeles — It's Los Angeles' turn for the torch. Mayor Karen Bass accepted the Olympic flag at the Paris closing ceremony Sunday, before handing it off to a key representative of LA's local business — Tom Cruise — who in a pre-recorded trek via motorcycle, plane and parachute kicked off the countdown to 2028.


The city will become the third in the world to host the games three times as it adds to the storied years of 1932 and 1984. Here's a look forward and back in time at the Olympics in LA.


LA's Olympic trilogy



Los Angeles got the 2028 games as a consolation prize when Paris was picked for 2024.


Back in 1932, LA hosted its first Olympics. The city was the only bidder for the games at a time marred by the Great Depression and the absence of several nations. Yet memorable sport moments came from athletes including American athlete Babe Didrikson Zaharias, who won golds in the new women's events of javelin and hurdles.




Financial and cultural success gave 1984 a reputation as the “good” Olympics" which made seemingly every major world city want their own.


Emphasizing both the modern and the classical with a hand from Hollywood, the games opened with decathlon champion Rafer Johnson lighting the torch, a guy in a jetpack descending into the Memorial Coliseum and theme music by “Star Wars” maestro John Williams.


With Eastern Bloc countries boycotting, the U.S. dominated. Carl Lewis and Mary Lou Retton are among the athletes who became household names. A young Michael Jordan led the men's basketball team to gold.


The games renewed, for a while, the global reputation of a city that had been perceived to be in decline.


“We want our games to be a modern games, youthful, full of the optimism that Southern California brings to the world and the globe,” Janet Evans, four-time Olympic gold medalist in swimming and chief athlete officer for the LA 2028 organizing committee, told The Associated Press in Paris.


Passing the torch



Bass, who arrives back in LA Monday, spent these games in Paris along with organizers and city officials, learning what it takes to host the world's largest sporting event.




Joining her were LA28 Chairperson Casey Wasserman, an entertainment executive, and LA councilmember Traci Park, chair of the city Olympic committee.


“As we’ve seen here in Paris, the Olympics are an opportunity to make transformative change,” Bass said at a press conference ahead of the closing ceremony.


Venues old and new, plus a swimming stadium

Amid a stadium-and-arena boom, LA will polish existing structures rather than erect new ones.


“It's a no-build games,” Evans said.


After Paris' innovative opening ceremony on the Seine River, LA plans to open with a traditional, stadium-based approach at SoFi Stadium in neighboring Inglewood that also incorporates the century-old Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles itself.


Home to two NFL teams, SoFi has hosted a Super Bowl and several Taylor Swift concerts since opening in 2020. It will become what organizers say is the largest Olympic swimming venue ever. Its opening ceremony role means swimming will come after track and field for the first time since 1972.


Intuit Dome, the soon-to-open Inglewood home of the NBA's Clippers, would be the games' newest major venue and is the planned home for Olympic basketball. The Lakers' downtown Crypto.com Arena will host gymnastics.




The toxicity of swimming in the Seine became a serious issue in Paris. That could put renewed focus on the Long Beach area waterfront when it hosts marathon swimming and triathlon races. Its cleanliness history is mixed but its ocean waters got consistently high marks in a 2023 analysis by nonprofit Heal the Bay.


The Long Beach shore was home to the pre-recorded performances during Sunday's ceremony of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, though it was easy to mistake for LA's Venice Beach, where the journey of the flag begun by Cruise was shown ending moments earlier.


Trains, buses and traffic



A city that's notoriously hard to traverse may seem like an odd fit for the Olympics, but it can work.


Bass said she plans to emulate the tactics of Tom Bradley, the mayor in 1984, whose traffic mitigations had some saying it was better than at non-Olympic times. They include asking local businesses to stagger workforce hours to reduce the number of cars on the road and allow work from home during the 17-day games.


Landing the Olympics under then-Mayor Eric Garcetti in 2017 gave the city an unusually long lead time for planning.


While it's no Paris Metro, LA has built a subway since its last Olympics, with lines running past major venues.


In 2018, the city planned an ambitious slate of 28 bus and rail projects to transform public transit. Some were scrapped but others moved forward, including the extension of a subway line to connect downtown Los Angeles with UCLA, the planned home of the Olympic Village.


Another high-profile project is the Inglewood People Mover, an automated, three-stop rail line past major Olympic venues. It initially received a commitment of $1 billion in federal funding, but opposition from Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters led to a $200 million reduction, the Los Angeles Times reported. It’s unclear whether the line will be completed by 2028.


Metro recently received $900 million in funding through an infrastructure spending package and grants from the Biden administration, of which $139 million will go directly toward improving transportation by 2028 and the goal of a “car-free” Olympics.


“The biggest challenge is not waiting to 2028, but really taking the opportunity between now and 2028 to help Angelenos and visitors alike reimagine the transportation network as something that will be their first choice,” Metro CEO Stephanie Wiggins said.


Crime, safety and perception



While crime rates were considerably higher in 1984 than today, the countdown to 2028 comes as the issue has gotten increased attention and cast a social-media-amplified shadow.


The Olympics are designated as a national special security event, which makes the U.S. Secret Service the lead agency tasked with developing a security plan, supported by significant federal resources.


LA city and county law enforcement sent officers to Paris to observe, learn and assist as they prepare for their own 2028 games.




There are many more encampments on city streets than there were in 1984, and it's unlikely LA will have solved its homeless crisis in the next four years. As the Paris games ended, California Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to withhold funding from cities unable to clear encampments.


Ahead of the Games in Paris, organizers relocated thousands of unhoused people, a practice also used for the 2016 Rio de Janiero games and criticized by activists as “social cleansing.”


Tourists and finances



LA is the “next logical destination” for the Olympics, said Adam Burke, president and CEO of the LA Tourism and Convention Board. “LA has emerged as really one of the world’s sports capitals.”


First though, the city will host a FIFA World Cup event and U.S. Women's Open in 2026 and another Super Bowl in 2027.


The city's hotel industry has continued to see growth, adding 9,000 new hotel rooms in the past four years with more to come over the next four.


LA28 organizers are banking on ticket sales, sponsorships, payments from the International Olympic Committee and other revenue streams to cover the games' $6.9 billion budget. The committee has brought in just over $1 billion toward a goal of $2.5 billion in domestic corporate sponsorships.

## Americans' refusal to keep paying higher prices may be dealing a final blow to US inflation spike

date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The great inflation spike of the past three years is nearly spent — and economists credit American consumers for helping slay it.


Some of America's largest companies, from Amazon to Disney to Yum Brands, say their customers are increasingly seeking cheaper alternative products and services, searching for bargains or just avoiding items they deem too expensive. Consumers aren't cutting back enough to cause an economic downturn. Rather, economists say, they appear to be returning to pre-pandemic norms, when most companies felt they couldn't raise prices very much without losing business.


“While inflation is down, prices are still high, and I think consumers have gotten to the point where they’re just not accepting it,” Tom Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said last week at a conference of business economists. "And that’s what you want: The solution to high prices is high prices.”


 




A more price-sensitive consumer helps explain why inflation has appeared to be steadily falling toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target, ending a period of painfully high prices that strained many people's budgets and darkened their outlooks on the economy. It also assumed a central place in the presidential election, with inflation leading many Americans to turn sour on the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the economy.


The reluctance of consumers to keep paying more has forced companies to slow their price increases — or even to cut them. The result is a cooling of inflation pressures.


Other factors have also helped tame inflation, including the healing of supply chains, which has boosted the availability of cars, trucks, meats and furniture, among other items, and the high interest rates engineered by the Fed, which slowed sales of homes, cars and appliances and other interest rate-sensitive purchases.


Still, a key question now is whether shoppers will pull back so much as to put the economy at risk. Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of economic activity. With evidence emerging that the job market is cooling, a drop in spending could potentially derail the economy. Such fears caused stock prices to plummet a week ago, though markets have since rebounded.




This week, the government will provide updates on both inflation and the health of the American consumer. On Wednesday, it will release the consumer price index for July. It's expected to show that prices — excluding volatile food and energy costs — rose just 3.2% from a year earlier. That would be down from 3.3% in June and would be the lowest such year-over-year inflation figure since April 2021.


And on Thursday, the government will report last month's retail sales, which are expected to have climbed a decent 0.3% from June. Such a gain would suggest that while Americans have become vigilant about their money, they are still willing to spend.


Many businesses have noticed.


“We’re seeing lower average selling prices ... right now because customers continue to trade down on price when they can,” said Andrew Jassy, CEO of Amazon.


David Gibbs, CEO of Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, told investors that a more cost-conscious consumer has slowed its sales, which slipped 1% in the April-June quarter at stores open for at least a year.


“Ensuring we provide consumers affordable options," Gibbs said, "has been an area of greater focus for us since last year.”




Other companies are cutting prices outright. Dormify, an online retailer that sells dorm supplies, is offering comforters starting at $69, down from $99 a year ago.


According to the Fed's “Beige Book,” an anecdotal collection of business reports from around the country that is released eight times a year, companies in nearly all 12 Fed districts have described similar experiences.


“Almost every district mentioned retailers discounting items or price-sensitive consumers only purchasing essentials, trading down in quality, buying fewer items or shopping around for the best deals,” the Beige Book said last month.


Most economists say consumers are still spending enough to sustain the economy consistently. Barkin said most of the businesses in his district — which covers Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and North and South Carolina — report that demand remains solid, at least at the right price.


“The way I’d put it is, consumers are still spending, but they’re choosing,” Barkin said.


In a speech a couple of weeks ago, Jared Bernstein, who leads the Biden administration's Council of Economic Advisers, mentioned consumer caution as a reason why inflation is nearing the end of a “round trip” back to the Fed's 2% target level.


Emerging from the pandemic, Bernstein noted, consumers were flush with cash after receiving several rounds of stimulus checks and having slashed their spending on in-person services. Their improved finances “gave certain firms the ability to flex a pricing power that was much less prevalent pre-pandemic." After COVID, consumers were “less responsive to price increases,” Bernstein said.


As a result, “the old adage that the cure for high prices is high prices [was] temporarily disengaged,” Bernstein said.


So some companies raised prices even more than was needed to cover their higher input costs, thereby boosting their profits. Limited competition in some industries, Bernstein added, made it easier for companies to charge more.


Barkin noted that before the pandemic, inflation remained low as online shopping, which makes price comparisons easy, became increasingly prevalent. Major retailers also held down costs, and increased U.S. oil production brought down gas prices.


“A price increase was so rare," Barkin said, “that if someone came to you with a 5% or 10% price increase, you almost just threw them out, like, ‘How could you possibly do it?’ ”


That changed in 2021.


“There are labor shortages, Barkin said. “Supply chain shortages. And the price increases are coming to you from everywhere. Your gardener is raising your prices, and you don’t have the capacity to do anything other than accept them.”


The economist Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, dubbed this phenomenon “sellers' inflation" in 2023. In an influential paper, she wrote that "publicly reported supply chain bottlenecks" can “create legitimacy for price hikes” and “create acceptance on the part of consumers to pay higher prices.”


Consumers are no longer so accepting, Barkin said.


“People have a little bit more time to stop and say, ‘How do I feel about paying $9.89 for a 12-pack of Diet Coke when I used to pay $5.99?’ They don’t like it that much, and so people are making choices.”


Barkin said he expects this trend to continue to slow price increases and cool inflation.


“I’m actually pretty optimistic that over the next few months, we’re going to see good readings on the inflation side,” he said. “All the elements of inflation seem to be settling down.”

## Harris is pushing joy. Trump paints a darker picture. Will moods matter?

date: 2024-08-12, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — At the top of his first speech as her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz turned to Vice President Kamala Harris and declared, "Thank you for bringing back the joy." The next day, Harris took the theme a step further, branding the Democratic ticket "joyful warriors."


Contrast that with former President Donald Trump, who opened a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida a few days later by saying, "We have a lot of bad things coming up," and predicting the U.S. could fall into an economic depression unseen since the dark days of 1929 or even another world war.


"I think that our country is, right now, in the most dangerous position it's ever been in, from an economic standpoint, from a safety standpoint," Trump said Thursday.


Democrats are playing up their sunnier outlook, promoting the idea that voters can be inspired to support someone and not just cast their ballot against the other side. The Trump campaign argues their candidate is reflecting the dour mood of the country and dismisses the idea that a growing contrast in tone and upbeat attitude will decide the presidency.


Two-thirds of Americans reported feeling very or somewhat pessimistic about the state of politics, according to polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research from last month. Roughly 7 in 10 said things in the country are heading in the wrong direction.


Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the former president, said people don't care about "vibe checks."


"That's not making gas or food or housing less expensive," Miller said.


Walz promotes positivity


Still, just how hard Harris is betting on the opposite approach is evident in her decision to pick Walz, whose personal story includes being on the coaching staff of a high school football team that had gone winless just a few years earlier to clinching a state championship in 1999.




The Minnesota governor's relentless positivity is meant to give supporters a jolt of new energy and keep the momentum that Harris has built after President Joe Biden — facing mounting pressure from within his own party and increasingly pessimistic views about his chances in November — stepped aside and endorsed his vice president.


Walz spent his first week as Harris' running mate traveling to swing states with Harris and underscored the point during a rally in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, celebrating what he said was "the ability to talk about what can be good."


"This idea of caring for our neighbor and kindness, and a hand up when somebody needs it. And just the sense that people go through things and to be able to be there when they need it, that's who we are," he said. "It's not about mocking. It's not name-calling."


Biden often ended his speeches saying he'd never been more optimistic. But he built his now-shuttered reelection bid around branding Trump an existential threat to democracy. The president offered dire predictions about the former president, suggesting he'd dismantle the nation's founding principles should he retake the White House.


Harris' campaign still relies on many of the same themes, decrying Trump as a threat to democracy, warning that he'll impose draconian limits to abortion and voting and that he will follow Project 2025, a plan championed by top conservatives to remake large swaths of the federal government.


And despite Walz insisting that smiles were more powerful than insults, he and Harris have continued their share of denunciations, decrying Trump's conviction in New York on 34 felony counts in a hush-money case and his being found liable for fraudulent business practices and sexual abuse in civil court.


Still, even before she named Walz her running mate, Harris was suggesting that she could help make politics fun again.


"We love our country. And I believe it is the highest form of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country," Harris declared in campaign speeches before picking Walz. She now tells crowds that she and her running mate "both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down."


Paula Montagna, who went to see Harris and Walz at a rally outside Detroit last week, highlighted the shift in messaging since Harris took over from Biden.


"Kamala is so positive, and it's nice to hear positive instead of negative," Montagna said.


Trump team says their candidate is reflecting reality


Trump's senior campaign advisers counter that the mood of the country right now is sour over the economy, the state of the U.S.-Mexico border and turmoil in the Middle East and beyond. They see their candidate as reflecting that reality rather than what they believe is a temporary exuberance igniting the Democratic base after months of discouragement over their ticket.




Trump has tried to harness that with his repeated predictions of stock market crashes and war. His campaign appearances have included a long list of other warnings that have veered into the apocalyptic, saying that if he's not elected, "we're not going to have a country anymore," that "the only thing standing between you and its obliteration is me," and that under a Harris administration, "Social Security will buckle and collapse" and "the suburbs will be overrun with violent crime and savage foreign gangs."


During his Republican National Convention speech last month, where his advisers said Trump would seem changed and more personal after surviving an attempted assassination, the former president did strike a different tone — at least to start.


He said early on that he had "a message of confidence, strength and hope" and sought to "launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed."


But by the end, Trump had returned to predictions of doom, twice warning, "Bad things are going to happen."


Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, has drawn a sharp contrast with Walz. Vance has been cheered on the right for being an aggressive fighter on behalf of the former president, particularly when engaging with reporters.


"Right now, I am angry about what Kamala Harris has done to this country and done to the American southern border," Vance said at a campaign stop in Michigan. "And I think most people in our country, they can be happy-go-lucky sometimes, they can enjoy things sometimes, and they can turn on the news and recognize that what's going on in this country is a disgrace."


Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, not himself known for a sunny disposition, offered much the same assessment Friday at a conservative conference in Atlanta hosted by radio host Erick Erickson.


"The country is obviously in a bad mood," McConnell said.


Trump supporters waiting to see him at a rally in Bozeman, Montana, said they felt the former president's campaign made them feel positive — even if his message often isn't.


"Just looking at the state of the country now, I don't think Kamala Harris' campaign is one of joy and hope. I think that's Trump's campaign," said Alex Lustig, a 23-year-old from Billings, Montana.


Fred Scarlett, a 63-year-old retiree from Condon, Montana, said that "everyone understands that we need to be here to support Trump because he has never let us down."


"They shoot at him," Scarlett said, "and he still keeps firing back."
