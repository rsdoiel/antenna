<h2 id="ai-causing-burnout-lower-productivity">AI causing burnout, lower
productivity</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Is machine learning, also known as “artificial intelligence”, really
aiding workers and increasing productivity? A study by Upwork – which,
as Baldur Bjarnason so helpfully points out, sells AI solutions and
hence did not promote this study on its blog as it does with its other
studies – reveals that this might not actually be the case. Nearly half
(47%) of workers using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the
productivity gains their employers expect. Over three in four (77%) say
AI tools have decreased their productivity and added to their workload
in at least one way. For example, survey respondents reported that
they’re spending more time reviewing or moderating AI-generated content
(39%), invest more time learning to use these tools (23%), and are now
being asked to do more work (21%). Forty percent of employees feel their
company is asking too much of them when it comes to AI. ↫ Upwork
research This shouldn’t come as a surprise. We’re in a massive hype
cycle when it comes to machine learning, and we’re being told it’s going
to revolutionise work and lead to massive productivity gains. In
practice, however, it seems these tools just can’t measure up to the
hyped promises, and in fact is making people do less and work slower.
There’s countless stories of managers being told by upper management to
shove machine learning into everything, from products to employee
workflows, whether it makes any sense to do so or not. I know from
experience as a translator that machine learning can greatly improve my
productivity, but the fact that there are certain types of tasks that
benefit from ML, doesn’t mean every job suddenly thrives with it. I’m
definitely starting to see some cracks in the hype cycle, and this study
highlights a major one. I hope we can all come down to earth again, and
really take a careful look at where ML makes sense and where it does
not, instead of giving every worker a ChatGPT account and blanket
demanding massive productivity gains that in no way match the reality on
the office floor. And of course, despite demanding massive productivity
increases, it’s not like workers are getting an equivalent increase in
salary. We’ve seen massive productivity increases for decades now, while
paychecks have not followed suit at all, and many people can actually
buy less with their salary today than their parents could decades ago.
Demands imposed by managers by introducing AI is only going to make this
discrepancy even worse.</p>

and illness prevention plans — to protect workers from extreme heat. A

Methane has long been recognized as a dangerous greenhouse gas,
shorter-lived in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, but more than 80
times more potent in its first 20 years there.

new paper</a> in <em>Frontiers in Science</em> finds that methane
emissions are growing at an alarming rate. Annual emissions in the 2020s
are clocking in at about 30 million tons more than during the previous
decade. While the study acknowledges there is no single reason for this,
the authors point to fossil fuel processing, livestock, and wetlands as
contributing factors. This spells trouble for the climate, particularly
over the next couple decades. “Reducing CO2 will protect our

on Tuesday. The reactor uses a modular design, allowing Kairos to
manufacture it in Albuquerque before shipping it to the construction
location, and employs fluoride salt cooling technology, a departure from
the light water cooling that is the norm in the U.S. nuclear industry.
In fact, the reactor was the first non-light water reactor to receive
construction approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in more

<li>New climate change accounting standards

<p>
The International Accounting Standards Board sets the norms for
companies in 140 jurisdictions — including the U.S., Canada, the E.U.,
and Japan — on how to record and report financial data. On Wednesday,
the Board proposed

for companies to show how climate change might affect their bottom
lines. Both climate impacts (like floods and extreme heat) and targets
(like net-zero strategies) have a bearing on a firm’s financial
performance, the IASB said. Wednesday’s guidance, which now enters a
consultation period, aims to provide a standardized approach to
reporting these factors to investors.

The guidance follows a March announcement by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that it will require companies to disclose climate
change-related information to investors. As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo

<li>Meet Maximo, the solar-panel-installing robot
</h3>
<p>
On Tuesday, electric utility AES introduced a new hire: Maximo, a pickup
truck-sized robot charged with installing panels at the company’s solar
farms. AES says Maximo can install these heavy panels at twice the rate
a human could, using artificial intelligence to line them up. The
company plans to employ Maximo first on its solar-plus-battery project
in Kern County, California, later this year.
</p>
<p>
If Maximo proves effective, he may get some siblings. Large solar farms
can take 12 to 18 months to build and often require workers to operate
in extreme heat. Robots could reduce risks to workers and help companies
accelerate their construction timelines. The flipside? The number of
solar workers in the U.S. is expected to double by 2033, and these
workers may find some stiff competition from Maximo.

id="logitech-has-an-idea-for-a-forever-mouse-that-requires-a-subscription">Logitech
has an idea for a “forever mouse” that requires a subscription</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber talked about someting called the “forever
mouse”, which would be, as the name implies, a mouse that customers
could use for a very long time. While you may think this would mean an
incredibly well-built mouse, or one that can be easily repaired, which
Logitech already makes somewhat possible through a partnership with
iFixIt, another option the company is thinking about is a subscription
model. Yes. Faber said subscription software updates would mean that
people wouldn’t need to worry about their mouse. The business model is
similar to what Logitech already does with video conferencing services
(Logitech’s B2B business includes Logitech Select, a subscription
service offering things like apps, 24/7 support, and advanced RMA).
Having to pay a regular fee for full use of a peripheral could deter
customers, though. HP is trying a similar idea with rentable printers
that require a monthly fee. The printers differ from the idea of the
forever mouse in that the HP hardware belongs to HP, not the user.
However, concerns around tracking and the addition of ongoing expenses
are similar. ↫ Scharon Harding at Ars Technica Now, buying a mouse whose
terrible software requires subscription models would still be a choice
you can avoid, but my main immediately conjured up a far darker
scenario. PC makers have a long history of adding crapware to their
machines in return for payments from the producers of said crapware. I
can totally see what’s going to happen next. You buy a brand new laptop,
unbox it at home, and turn it on. Before you know it, a dialog pops up
right after he crappy Windows out-of-box experience asking you to
subscribe to your laptop’s touchpad software in order to unlock its more
advanced features like gestures. But why stop there? The keyboard of
that new laptop has RGB backlighting, but if you want to change its
settings, you’re going to have to pay for another subscription. Your
laptop’s display has additional features and modes for specific types of
content and more settings sliders, but you’ll have to pay up to unlock
them. And so on. I’m not saying this will happen, but I’m also not
saying it won’t. I’m sorry for birthing this idea into the world.</p>

2025</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
It has been a strange year for the climate left’s relationship with the
word “if.” Over the past several months, some activists and advocates
had begun to use the word with me in such a way that it started to sound
an awful lot like “when.” <em><em>If Donald Trump is reelected… If
Republicans return to power… </em></em>
</p>
<p>
The tone wasn’t hypothetical; it was
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding#:~:text=It%20is%20in%20a%20race%20to%20spend%20as%20much%20of%20the%20money%20as%20it%20can%20in%20the%20next%20year%20%E2%80%94%20before%20a%20potential%20change%20of%20administration%20in%202025%20and%20before%20climate%20change%20gets%20any%20worse." target="_self"><u>resigned</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
In the past week and a half, however, “if” has gotten its mojo back.
Early this morning, the climate policy group Evergreen Action released
what it’s calling the
“<a href="https://evergreenaction.com/initiatives/a-bold-climate-plan-evergreen-action-plan-2" target="_blank">Evergreen
Action Plan 2.0</a>” — essentially, a green wishlist for an incoming
Democratic administration. Had the document been published a month
earlier, after President Biden’s disastrous debate performance, it might
have come across as vaguely farfetched; now,
<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-close-races-battleground-states-show-voters-locked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>judging
by the polls</u></a>, there’s a real chance that some of its proposals
could actually become law in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Started by former staffers of Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s
presidential campaign, Evergreen Action has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/kamala-harris-climate-record" target="_self"><u>advised
Kamala Harris on her climate policies before</u></a>. The group also
<a href="https://www.evergreenaction.com/blog/we-wrote-the-climate-playbook-in-2020-biden-has-made-significant-progress-and-theres-more-opportunity-ahead-14" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>boasts</u></a>
that the Biden-Harris administration has made progress on 85% of the
policy recommendations issued in its original 2020 Evergreen Action
Plan. Although Evergreen Action doesn’t hold the same sway over a future
Harris administration as the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>does
over Donald Trump</u></a> (to his
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/project-2025-head-steps-down-89cba52b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>apparently
increasing concern</u></a>), it <em><em>does</em></em> seem pretty safe
to say that Evergreen Action 2.0 has the potential to be an enormously
influential document in a Harris White House.
</p>
<p>
So — what’s in it?
</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, the Evergreen Action Plan 2.0 aims to extend the gains
made by Biden’s administration and the Inflation Reduction Act — the
words “continue” or “continuing” are used 43 times in the document,
“further” 38 times, and “expand” or “expanded” 28 times. The plan is
broken into seven core strategies that are broadly framed around
climate, jobs, and justice, including “Cementing a Clean and Effective
National Grid,” “Promoting Healthy Communities With a Modern
Transportation System,” “Achieving Healthy Neighborhoods With
Zero-Emission Homes and Commercial Buildings,” and “Supporting All
Communities to Build a Thriving Clean Energy Economy and Move Away From
Fossil Fuels.”
</p>
<p>
Within these sections, stand-out proposals include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Setting a first-of-its-kind federal clean energy standard
</strong>to fully decarbonize the grid by 2035.
</li>
<li>
Passing a “national grid law <strong>creating an inter-regional transfer
capacity and shared grid management entity</strong>” in order to “align
federal authority to manage and site necessary transmission, and …
ensure full uptake of valuable IRA incentives for clean energy.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Finalizing carbon limits for existing gas plants</strong> “no
later than the end of 2025” and ideally by December 2024.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Issuing an industrial decarbonization Day 1 Executive
Order</strong> that commits the country to a “rapid decarbonization
strategy for each industrial category.” Such an order could help
“prioritize innovation projects … leading to the development of regional
hubs for industrial decarbonization,” spur the EPA to begin a
“standard-setting process to tackle industrial climate pollution,” and
encourage the agency to further use grants, Superfund, and planning and
permitting programs to “accelerate the deployment of clean industrial
technologies and repurposing and clean up legacy industrial sites.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Joining an international
“</strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/13/carbon-tariff-climate-change-china/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>carbon
club</strong></u></a><strong>”</strong> via legislation that “adds
duties or fees to imports of similar goods produced using high-carbon
methods in other countries.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Focusing on building out a zero-emissions freight
sector</strong> by issuing “clear standards to help decarbonize sources
like trains, freight facilities and ports, off-road vehicles, ships, and
planes.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Adopting a
“</strong><a href="https://www.evergreenaction.com/blog/what-is-the-climate-test-how-can-we-use-it-to-stop-the-next-mega-fossil-fuel-project" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>climate
test</strong></u></a><strong>” to guide all federal energy extraction
decisions</strong><strong>; </strong><strong>cutting subsidies and
statutory loopholes for fossil fuel companies; ending exports of
liquefied natural gas; withdrawing East Coast waters from oil
drilling</strong><strong>, and more.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The most radical section of the Evergreen Action Plan 2.0, however,
comes at the end. Acknowledging both the volatility of our national
politics and the reality that it will take longer than four more years
to put the U.S. on the right course of decarbonization, the plan extends
the definition of “climate policy” to include proposals intended to
shore up public and democratic institutions. Some of those include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Abolishing the filibuster</strong> <strong>rule</strong> that
“prevents the Senate from acting on climate and other policies the
public overwhelmingly supports.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Repealing the
“</strong><a href="https://www.gao.gov/legal/congressional-review-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><strong>Congressional
Review Act</strong></u></a><strong>,”</strong> which has been used to
“block needed climate standards and other common-sense public health and
safety measures.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ensuring the Supreme Court is “governed by a binding ethics
code,” and potentially “adding justices to the Court, adding term
limits</strong>, and exploring appropriate statutory guidance to limit
or reverse the Court’s recent spate of radical attacks on environmental
laws.”
</li>
<li>
<strong>Working with Congress to restore
</strong><a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-chevron" target="_self"><u><strong>the
Chevron doctrine</strong></u></a>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Pursuing other democratic reforms “including restoration of the
Voting Rights Act and federal legislative remedies for improper
gerrymandering, along with long-term efforts to reform or abolish the
Electoral College,</strong><strong> would further shake loose fossil
fuel control of Congress and enable equitable policymaking
nationwide.”</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course, the Evergreen Action Plan 2.0 is nothing more than a wishlist
— it is far from a binding document — and there are still a whole lot of
“ifs” standing between it and implementation.
</p>
<p>
But for the climate left, “if” is a start.

<h2 id="an-undue-burden">An ‘Undue Burden’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Prague/Washington  — Portraits of Alsu Kurmasheva are scattered
throughout the Prague apartment she shares with her husband and two
daughters. But the journalist has not set foot here in more than a
year.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most striking of the paintings, all of which were done by
her husband, Pavel Butorin, is the one that remains unfinished, perched
on an easel in the living room. Butorin started it after Kurmasheva, 47,
was jailed in Russia in October 2023 on charges that are widely viewed
as baseless and politically motivated.</p>
<p>Painting, Butorin says, is just one way he has tried to cope with his
wife’s absence.</p>
<p>“Even to say, ‘We miss Alsu,’ doesn’t quite convey the emotion that
we go through,” Butorin told VOA at the family’s home. “I get up, and
the first thing in my head is Alsu. I’ve just been really unable to
escape this.”</p>
<p>With their lives intertwined — from raising their daughters Bibi and
Miriam, to working at the same news network — he is never far from
reminders that his wife is 1,700 miles away, in a prison in the city of
Kazan.</p>
<p>“In the evening, we sit at this table. We see an empty chair,”
Butorin said, his eyes fixed on the seat at the large, wooden table, as
if he were willing his wife to appear. “It signifies a broken family, a
family torn apart by an unjust, merciless, heartless regime.”</p>
<p>When Butorin spoke with VOA in Prague in July, his wife — who has
dual U.S.-Russian citizenship — was approaching nine months in custody.
Less than one week later, on July 19, she was convicted behind closed
doors of spreading what Moscow says is false information about its
military and sentenced to six and a half years in prison.</p>
<p>On the same day, about 450 miles east, in the city of Yekaterinburg,
Russia, a secret Russian court convicted American journalist Evan
Gershkovich to 16 years behind bars.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has called for the immediate release of both
journalists. Press freedom groups, meanwhile, have condemned the trials
as shams and said the cases underscore how Moscow’s war in Ukraine means
American journalists are at a heightened risk of being used as political
pawns by the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva and Gershkovich count themselves among the 22 journalists
jailed in Russia at the end of 2023, more than half of whom are foreign
nationals, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.</p>
<p>Russia’s Foreign Ministry and embassy in Washington did not reply to
VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story.</p>
<p>Despite the international condemnation, Butorin has largely
shouldered the responsibility of advocating for Kurmasheva’s release by
himself. For months, he has found himself balancing the roles of father,
journalist and advocate as he shuttles between Prague and
Washington.</p>
<p>Hostage experts say his experience is common for American families
who have a loved one held hostage or unjustly detained.</p>
<p>A decade ago, Diane Foley was one of them as she tried to navigate
complex bureaucracy and conflicting information when Islamic State
militants kidnapped and later killed her son, American journalist James
Foley, in 2014.</p>
<p>Her experience led her to establish the Foley Foundation, which
supports families and advocates for Americans unjustly jailed
abroad.</p>
<p>“A lot of families don’t have any idea how to contact media or get
their story heard, how to contact their congressman, how to get their
voices heard through the bureaucracy. So we seek to help them navigate
that,” she told VOA during one of her regular trips to Washington.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has made progress in these policy areas, she
says. But so much more still needs to be done.</p>
<p>A longtime journalist at the Tatar-Bashkir Service of VOA’s sister
outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, or RFE/RL, Kurmasheva had
planned only a brief visit to Russia to care for her ailing mother.</p>
<p>Her desk at work remains relatively untouched. Business cards are
still spread out on the table. And the calendar — still set to May 2023
— shows where she underlined in black ink the dates of the ill-fated
trip.</p>
<p>In the weeks following Kurmasheva’s jailing, her colleague Ramazan
Alpaut said he still turned around at his desk, half-expecting to see
Kurmasheva sitting behind him.</p>
<p>“We miss her here as a person and as a colleague,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva’s arrest came as a shock for the team, and a warning that
travel to see family in Russia is no longer an option.</p>
<p>That fact, says Tatar-Bashkir Service chief Rim Gilfanov,
crystallizes an already difficult reality for exiled Russians grappling
with the fallout of the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>But more immediately, he says, he just wants a key member of his team
back.</p>
<p>“Alsu is our veteran journalist,” Gilfanov says. “The main quality
that comes to my mind when I think of Alsu is constant eagerness and
preparedness to help everyone.”</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes have long targeted RFE/RL and its journalists.
Russia has designated the outlet a foreign agent and an undesirable
organization. And Kurmasheva is one of four of its journalists currently
in prison, including two in Belarus and one in Russian-occupied
Crimea.</p>
<p>“It’s a grim reality that starts to set in that we are targets,”
RFE/RL president and CEO Stephen Capus told VOA. “They’re trying to make
the pursuit of journalism a crime.”</p>
<p>“They are taking me to the investigative committee right now.”</p>
<p>Butorin was at work when he got this distressed voice message from
his wife. It was October 18, 2023, and agents dressed in black and
wearing balaclavas had arrived at the home of Kurmasheva’s mother to
arrest the journalist.</p>
<p>The next time he heard his wife’s voice was in April 2024, when she
spoke to reporters from a glass defendant’s box about the poor prison
conditions she was experiencing.</p>
<p>“We love to hear her voice. But it’s also painful to see her in a
glass cage,” Butorin said.</p>
<p>Butorin, director of Current Time TV, a Russian-language television
and digital network led by RFE/RL in partnership with VOA, was at work
when he listened to the message.</p>
<p>His office is now part shrine, filled with photos and posters and
newspaper articles about his wife. On the whiteboard, Free Alsu magnets
depict a cartoon of her face. Butorin drew the image for Kurmasheva’s
Gmail profile picture, he said. Now it’s on magnets and buttons — like
the one pinned to the lapel of his dark blue suit jacket this July
afternoon.</p>
<p>In a corner, next to a Lego diorama of the set of the TV show
“Seinfeld” — a series the family loves to watch — is a stack of copies
of No to War. The book, which Kurmasheva helped edit, features stories
of 40 Russians who opposed Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Pro-Russian media have reported that Kurmasheva’s arrest is linked to
that book. But to date, authorities have failed to publicly provide
evidence to substantiate its charges against her.</p>
<p>“It’s a harmless little book,” Butorin said. “It just reminds me how
incredibly arbitrary this detention is.”</p>
<p>Butorin has spent an unknown number of hours thinking about his
wife’s captors. Are they evil personified? Or, à la Hannah Arendt and
the banality of evil, are they just bureaucrats “thoughtlessly” doing
their jobs?</p>
<p>The answer likely lies somewhere in the middle, he recognizes, but
Butorin still finds himself wondering whether the judges and prosecutors
once listened to her deep voice on the radio, back when she hosted a
show for audiences in Tatarstan.</p>
<p>Kurmasheva’s long absence has been marked by bittersweet birthdays
and holidays, more media interviews than Butorin can count, and five
trips to Washington to press lawmakers and U.S. government officials to
do more for his wife.</p>
<p>In his office, just a few days before he departs for one of those
trips, he admits that, like many journalists, he prefers to be behind
the camera instead of being the story.</p>
<p>But that preference for privacy is no more.</p>
<p>“I fear if I don’t keep this story in the news, and if I don’t keep
Alsu’s story alive, that U.S. policymakers, members of the
administration, of any administration, will just start forgetting about
her,” Butorin said. “I see a problem there.”</p>
<p>Butorin, who is also a U.S. citizen, is quick to voice appreciation
for the support officials and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have
offered. It turns out that press freedom is one of the few issues that
Democrats and Republicans can agree on.</p>
<p>But the trips to the American capital are also stained with
frustration.</p>
<p>Requests to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been
denied, Butorin said. (Blinken also serves as an ex officio member of
the board that oversees the entities under the U.S. Agency for Global
Media, including RFE/RL and VOA.) To date, the highest-ranking official
Butorin has met with is Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena
Bitter.</p>
<p>Feeling optimistic can be difficult, Butorin said, when, in meeting
after meeting, the same officials regurgitate the same talking points
and offer little concrete information.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I walk out with a sense of desperation, and sometimes I
find these meetings very unsatisfactory,” he says.</p>
<p>It’s a problem familiar to Diane Foley.</p>
<p>When Islamic State militants kidnapped her son in 2012, she says, the
process was even more opaque.</p>
<p>“Our government doesn’t seem to trust these desperate families, who
want their loved one back, with what information they have,” she
said.</p>
<p>To Foley, “an undue burden” is still placed on families to fight for
the U.S. government’s attention.</p>
<p>“It’s all on the family in the U.S. That hasn’t changed a whole lot,”
she said. “It was all on me, all on our family, when Jim was taken — all
on us to figure it out. And now it’s still all on the family.”</p>
<p>Foley and her foundation are helping Butorin navigate the process,
including by working behind the scenes to push the State Department.</p>
<p>In that time, she has grown close to the couple’s daughters. “When I
see Bibi and Miriam, God bless them. They shouldn’t, as teenagers, be
dealing with this,” she said.</p>
<p>In late July, she and Butorin took part in a Foley Foundation event
in the Capitol Building, to mark the release of its annual report on
U.S. hostage policy. The foundation counts 46 Americans held hostage or
unjustly detained around the world.</p>
<p>At the panel, Dustin Stewart, the deputy special presidential envoy
for hostage affairs, spoke about the support the government offers.</p>
<p>Butorin rebutted that because Kurmasheva has not been declared
wrongfully detained, his family is not receiving any of that
support.</p>
<p>At the panel, Stewart told VOA, “On the process, I’ll just say, it’s
ongoing.”</p>
<p>The designation opens up extra resources and support for families and
commits the government to secure their release.</p>
<p>It is the biggest difference between the cases of Kurmasheva and
Gershkovich, the other American journalist jailed in Russia. In the
latter case, the United States declared The Wall Street Journal reporter
wrongfully detained within two weeks of his arrest. Press freedom groups
have criticized the State Department for not declaring Kurmasheva
wrongfully detained, too.</p>
<p>When pressed as to if and when Kurmasheva will be designated, the
State Department has on several occasions sent VOA identical or nearly
identical statements that say the Department “continuously reviews the
circumstances” of Americans detained overseas to determine if they are
wrongful. Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage
affairs, has denied VOA’s multiple requests for an interview about
Kurmasheva’s case.</p>
<p>To cope, Butorin says compartmentalizing has become a necessary
strategy.</p>
<p>“It may come across as a little disingenuous, but you do have to
treat all these little areas of your life as projects,” he said. Those
“projects” range from calling on Blinken to declare his wife wrongfully
detained to dealing with the “Kafkaesque bureaucracy” of the Czech
postal system that prevents him from collecting his wife’s mail.</p>
<p>In public events and interviews, Butorin leans toward the stoic,
which he notes is unlike Kurmasheva, who can go into a room and “walk
away with five or 10 new friends.”</p>
<p>“Some people may think that I lack emotion,” Butorin said. “But it’s
all a front. I’m hurting on the inside.”</p>
<p>It’s when Butorin is by himself that he says he feels the most pain.
“When the girls go to bed, I usually go to bed soon, too,” Butorin said,
“so I’m not left alone with my thoughts.”</p>
<p>And when he is with the couple’s daughters, there are glimpses of the
joy and the humor the family still manages to share.</p>
<p>After an interview in Washington, Butorin excitedly showed videos
from an Olivia Rodrigo concert he attended with his daughters. Nearby,
Bibi, 16, and Miriam, 12, were writing postcards to friends in Prague.
Butorin made fun of one of them for how she wrote the number seven.</p>
<p>“You cross your sevens? That’s un-American,” he said with a smirk,
provoking laughter from both girls.</p>
<p>When Kurmasheva eventually returns, Butorin quipped that she will
find their daughters taller than she is. “But more importantly, she will
see very strong young women who have had to grow up really quickly,” he
said.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when Butorin sees videos or photos of his wife in court,
he finds himself wondering whether she’s still the same person. In any
case, he and his daughters aren’t.</p>
<p>“It’s hurting my family a lot that my mom isn’t here with us,” Bibi
said. “It’s been so long already, and we just don’t want to get used to
our mom not being here, because we’re getting close to that,
unfortunately.”</p>
<p>Back in the family’s Prague apartment, the teenager alternates
between talking about Taylor Swift and calling on Russian President
Vladimir Putin to release her mother. On the wall opposite her, an
abstract painting by her father depicts Kurmasheva pregnant with
Bibi.</p>
<p>“At the dinner table, I always feel like there’s something missing
because she’s not there. And it’s weird having to cook for one less
person. And it’s weird being in the car with one less person. And it’s
weird, because we were always a family of four. And now there’s one of
us missing,” Bibi said.</p>
<p>Butorin doesn’t like to dwell on the past, and by that he primarily
means Kurmasheva’s decision to travel to Russia in the first place. They
were both well aware of the risks, he said.</p>
<p>She had traveled there without incident in 2022. But the day she left
in 2023, he recalls Kurmasheva saying to him, “Tell me everything will
be OK.”</p>
<p>Some days, Butorin wishes he hadn’t let her go. But then, Kurmasheva
wouldn’t be Kurmasheva if she hadn’t gone.</p>
<p>“She is known as a selfless friend,” Butorin said. “That empathy and
her responsibility as a devoted daughter, that was what really drove her
to go to Russia.”</p>
<p>Bibi agreed. “She pays attention to every single person around her,
and she’s really willing to give up so many things about her and her
life to help others.”</p>
<p>As the family waits for any progress in her case, Butorin channels
his wife’s unselfishness and his daughters’ resiliency.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the luxury of just falling apart. Honestly, that’s not
an option for me,” Butorin said. “It’s just something that we have to
live with. I think I’m a fairly unremarkable person. It’s just something
that a father — any father — I think would do.”</p>

<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON — The United States on Tuesday carried out a
strike in Iraq in self-defense, U.S. officials told Reuters, as regional
tensions rose after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut that Israel said
killed Hezbollah’s most senior commander.</p>
<p>Iraqi police and medical sources said the strike inside a base south
of Baghdad used by Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) killed four
members of the group, which includes several Iran-aligned armed
militias, and wounded four others.</p>
<p>In a statement after the blasts, the Popular Mobilization Forces made
no accusation about who was responsible.</p>
<p>U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United
States carried out an airstrike in Musayib, in Babil province, but did
not provide more details on the location.</p>
<p>The officials added that the strike targeted militants that the U.S.
deemed were looking to launch drones and posed a threat to U.S. and
coalition forces.</p>
<p>The officials did not comment on any casualties.</p>
<p>“This action underscores the United States’ commitment to the safety
and security of our personnel,” one of the officials said.</p>
<p>Multiple rockets were launched last week toward Iraq’s Ain al-Asad
airbase housing U.S.-led forces, U.S. and Iraqi sources said, with no
damage or casualties reported. U.S. officials said none of the rockets
hit the base.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s action was the first known U.S. strike in Iraq since
February, when the U.S. military launched airstrikes in Iraq and Syria
against more than 85 targets linked to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard and
Iran-aligned militias.</p>
<p>The 150,000-strong Popular Mobilization Forces, a state-sanctioned
grouping of Iraqi paramilitaries, is dominated by heavily armed and
battle-hardened groups loyal to Iran and with close ties to its
Revolutionary Guards.</p>
<p>Iraq, a rare ally of both the U.S. and Iran that hosts 2,500 U.S.
troops and has Iran-backed militias linked to its security forces, has
witnessed escalating tit-for-tat attacks since the Israel-Hamas war
erupted in October.</p>
<p>Iraq wants troops from the U.S.-led military coalition to begin
withdrawing in September and to formally end the coalition’s work by
September 2025, Iraqi sources have said, with some U.S. forces likely to
remain in a newly negotiated advisory capacity.</p>
<p>The issue is highly politicized, with mainly Iran-aligned Iraqi
political factions looking to show that they are again pushing out the
country’s one-time occupier, while U.S. officials want to avoid giving
Iran and its allies a win.</p>
<p>U.S.-led forces invaded Iraq in 2003, toppled former leader Saddam
Hussein and then withdrew in 2011, only to return in 2014 to fight
Islamic State at the head of a coalition.</p>

<h2 id="us-needs-to-do-more-to-compete-with-china-says-official">US
needs to do more to compete with China, says official</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. State Department Deputy Secretary of State Kurt
Campbell says that whether it is exploring for rare earth minerals,
establishing military bases in Africa, or building more ships and
submarines, the United States needs to do more to compete with
China.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing Tuesday,
Campbell called China the “defining geopolitical challenge confronting
modern American diplomacy.”</p>
<p>“We need to do more, and we have to contest Chinese actions, not only
in terms of their forward basing strategy, but their desire to go after
Africa’s rare earths that will be critical for our industrial and
technological capabilities,” he said.</p>
<p>Campbell added that China has presented U.S. diplomats with a global
challenge that extends from economics and defense to information and
human rights.</p>
<p>Bipartisan desire to compete</p>
<p>Lawmakers from across the political divide who attended the hearing
agreed with that assessment and the need to compete with China’s
influence.</p>
<p>Republican Senator Marco Rubio from Florida expressed concern about
China being the “world’s leading shipbuilder” and “undisputed king of
basic industrial inputs.”</p>
<p>Campbell agreed with the senator, noting that the difference between
the two countries was “deeply concerning,” and that the U.S. “has to do
better” in shipbuilding.</p>
<p>He also said the United States submarine program needs more
attention.</p>
<p>In his opening remarks, Ben Cardin, a Democratic senator and chair of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States needs to
offer the Global South an alternative to China.</p>
<p>“In order to address these challenges, the United States should not
only be investing in our military, but also our diplomatic and economic
development tools,” Cardin said.</p>
<p>Technology and critical rare earth minerals used to make everything
from semiconductor chips to batteries in electric vehicles was an area
of particular focus during the hearing, given China’s dominance.</p>
<p>In 2022, China was the largest source of rare earth mineral imports
for the United States at 70%, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
It is also the world’s biggest supplier of rare earth minerals.</p>
<p>“If you look at a balance sheet of the top 40 trace elements and
minerals that are necessary for batteries or for semiconductors, the
vast lion’s share of those supplies are now controlled by China,”
Campbell said. He noted that while the U.S. was initially in an
unfavorable position, it has stepped up signing critical mineral
agreements with Japan and Australia.</p>
<p>Campbell also said the Lobito corridor project in Africa — a railway
that will run through mineral-rich Zambia and the Democratic Republic of
Congo to an Atlantic port in Angola — would help meet U.S. demand for
the minerals.</p>
<p>Hearing looks at relations with Africa</p>
<p>Increasing diplomatic relations with Africa was a key focus of the
hearing.</p>
<p>Campbell said he has traveled to Africa twice since his appointment
in February and has plans for a third trip. He also noted that there are
14 ambassador nominations for posts on the continent yet to be approved
by the Senate.</p>
<p>Several senators at the hearing stressed the need to increase the
U.S. diplomatic footprint and fill empty ambassadorial posts,
particularly within the Global South.</p>
<p>Campbell said the lack of U.S. ambassadors in key posts is
“embarrassing” and “antithetical to U.S. strategic interests.”</p>
<p>During the hearing, lawmakers also discussed the need for U.S.
involvement in international infrastructure development projects,
continued support of Ukraine against Russia’s invasion, and the need for
more efforts to combat Chinese misinformation and press manipulation in
third countries.</p>

destroying nearly 200 structures, US wildfire threatens thousands
more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FOREST RANCH, California — Fire crews worked Tuesday to hold on to
the progress made against the largest blaze in California this year
ahead of warming temperatures forecast for later this week. </p>
<p>Authorities said containment was 14% and lifted evacuation orders in
some communities of Butte County, where the Park Fire started last week
before spreading to a neighboring county and scorching an area bigger
than Los Angeles. The massive fire continues to burn through rugged,
inaccessible terrain with dense vegetation, threatening to spread to two
other counties. </p>
<p>“That’s going to be a continued challenge for us moving forward over
the next couple of days,” said Mark Brunton, an operations section chief
with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. </p>
<p>Cooler weather has helped firefighters stop the blaze’s path near
some communities like Forest Ranch, where some people began returning to
unscathed homes Tuesday. </p>
<p>Christopher and Anita Angeloni have lived in the community of 1,600
for 23 years and have had to evacuate several times due to wildfires,
including the 2018 Camp Fire that killed 85 people and decimated the
town of Paradise, about 8 miles (13 kilometers) south. </p>
<p>Christopher Angeloni said he constantly worked on creating defensible
space around his home and was happy to return home nearly a week after
evacuating to see his hard work paid off. </p>
<p>“We were prepared to possibly lose everything,” he said. </p>
<p>Anita Angeloni said it has been a stressful week. </p>
<p>“We have not been sleeping enough, very tense, praying all the time,
teary eyes,” she said. “But we’re here. We’ll see for how long.” </p>
<p>The Park Fire, now the fifth largest in the state’s recorded history,
was one of more than 100 large active wildfires burning in the U.S. on
Tuesday. It has scorched nearly 600 square miles (1,551 square
kilometers), according to CAL Fire. For comparison, the city of Los
Angeles covers about 470 square miles (1,217 square kilometers). </p>
<p>Some blazes were sparked by the weather, with climate change
increasing the frequency of lightning strikes as the western U.S.
endures blistering heat and bone-dry conditions. </p>
<p>The Park Fire started last Wednesday after authorities say a man
pushed a burning car down a ravine in Chico. It has destroyed nearly 200
structures and is threatening thousands more. The suspect, Ronnie Dean
Stout II, was charged with arson on Monday. His public defender, Nicole
Diamond, said in an email she had no comment. </p>
<p>Some progress against the fire was made after cooler temperatures,
more humidity, and calmer winds in the last few days helped firefighters
reach 14% containment as of Tuesday. </p>
<p>In the small forest community of Cohasset in Butte County, Ron Ward
ignored evacuation orders last week and stayed behind with his son to
defend his property, seeing Park Fire flames hundreds of feet high
approach his family ranch. </p>
<p>He had lost insurance coverage on the property just a month earlier
as companies increasingly drop California homeowners due to the growing
risk of wildfires in the state. </p>
<p>He said the flames reached within 70 feet (21 meters) of his house.
Then they stopped. </p>
<p>“It hit our sprinklers and kind of died down and then went around our
property and missed, missed all of our structures,” Ward said. His
100-year-old ranch was saved. </p>
<p>Ward had to be the one to call his bookkeeper and neighbors to tell
them their homes were gone. </p>
<p>“They haven’t even been able to get back to look at their homes,” he
said, tearing up as he recounted last week’s experience to The
Associated Press in an interview Monday. </p>
<p>All through Cohasset, there were remnants of the devastation, with
charred mailboxes and vehicles covered with pink fire retardant dropped
by aircraft. The husks of a washer and dryer set were surrounded by
burned debris and a blackened motorcycle was propped upright, balancing
on rims after its tires melted away. </p>
<p>Evacuation orders were in effect Tuesday on 25 wildfires, according
to the National Interagency Fire Center. More than 27,000 wildland
firefighters and support personnel are assigned to wildfires that have
burned more than 3,200 square miles (8,288 square kilometers)
nationwide, the center said. </p>
<p>In Southern California, people in Kern and Tulare counties were
ordered to evacuate because of a fire sweeping through the Sequoia
National Forest. The Borel Fire scorched through almost the entirety of
the historic mining town of Havilah, officials said. </p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled to visit the town of
250 people later Tuesday. </p>
<p>“We’re seeing so many of these iconic places in California . . .
being quite literally devastated by these new realities,” Newsom
said. </p>
<p>The fires burning throughout the state have overwhelmed California’s
firefighting capacity and outside help has started to arrive, officials
said. Newsom thanked Texas Governor Gregg Abbott on Tuesday for sending
more than two dozen fire engines to help combat the Park Fire this
week. </p>
<p>U.S. Fire Administrator Dr. Lori Moore-Merrell said one-third of U.S.
residents live in an area where human activities and wildland vegetation
intersect, creating a higher potential for wildfires, according to a
statement. </p>
<p>“We question living here for sure,” Ward said of his ranch in
Cohasset. But generations have remained since his wife’s
great-grandfather settled there in 1905, and he isn’t the one to leave,
he said. </p>
<p>“There’s a lot of history here,” Ward said. “So we live on this
ranch, and we’re committed to this ranch and preserving the ranch.”</p>

id="white-house-pushes-bidens-supreme-court-proposal-despite-republican-objections">White
House pushes Biden’s Supreme Court proposal despite Republican
objections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — The White House plans to continue President Joe Biden’s
push for sweeping reforms of the U.S. Supreme Court during his final
months in office, despite the proposal having little chance of passing
the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.</p>
<p>“What we welcome is a debate,” White House press secretary Karine
Jean-Pierre said in response to VOA’s question during her briefing
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Jean-Pierre said there is broad public support for reform of the
court. She sidestepped questions on whether the proposal is mainly a
messaging strategy ahead of the November presidential election rather
than a legislative goal for Biden, who is not seeking reelection.</p>
<p>“As many times as the president introduced legislation, or some ideas
of how the direction of the legislation that’s important to the American
people, we see a healthy debate,” she said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Biden urged Congress to eliminate lifetime appointments
for Supreme Court justices and establish a system in which the sitting
president would appoint a justice every two years to spend 18 years in
service on the court.</p>
<p>His proposal would “reduce the chance that any single president
imposes undue influence for generations to come,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Under the American political system, presidents appoint justices who
are confirmed by the U.S. Senate and serve on the Supreme Court until
they die or resign. The highest court of the land provides the final
word on legal interpretations of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Speaker of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson dismissed the
plan as part of Democrats’ “ongoing efforts to delegitimize the Supreme
Court.”</p>
<p>“It is telling that Democrats want to change the system that has
guided our nation since its founding simply because they disagree with
some of the Court’s recent decisions,” he said in a statement. “This
dangerous gambit of the Biden-Harris Administration is dead on arrival
in the House.”</p>
<p>Biden’s proposal would “tilt the balance of power and erode not only
the rule of law, but the American people’s faith in our system of
justice,” he added.</p>
<p>Six of the nine Supreme Court justices were appointed by Republican
presidents, including three by former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Biden also wants legislation to establish an enforceable ethics code
for the court’s nine justices. Currently, the justices are free to
police themselves under ethics rules that were put in place last year
following revelations that Justice Clarence Thomas had received
expensive gifts from Republican donors and that the wife of Justice
Samuel Alito flew two flags often used by followers of Trump’s Make
America Great Again movement.</p>
<p>The ethics part of the proposal is “the most politically feasible,”
said Claire Finkelstein, professor of law and philosophy at the
University of Pennsylvania and the director of the Penn Center for
Ethics and the Rule of Law.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts’ failure to discipline his own members
“cast great opprobrium on the court,” and makes it “illegitimate to a
large degree,” she told VOA, adding that there may be bipartisan support
“to rescue the court from its own problematic conduct.”</p>
<p>The third part of Biden’s reform proposal requires lawmakers to
ratify a constitutional amendment limiting presidential immunity.</p>
<p>An amendment would reverse the court’s recent landmark ruling in
favor of Trump that presidents are allowed some immunity from criminal
prosecution for acts conducted while in office.</p>
<p>“This nation was founded on the principle there are no kings in
America,” Biden said. “Each of us are equal before the law. No one is
above the law. For all practical purposes, the court’s decision almost
certainly means the president can violate their oath, flout our laws,
and face no consequences.”</p>
<p>Messaging push</p>
<p>Passage of the proposal seem unlikely in light of Republican control
of House and the Democrats’ slim majority in the Senate.</p>
<p>Passage of a constitutional amendment requires two-thirds support in
both congressional chambers, or approval by two-thirds of the states at
a special convention. Either way, it would then need to be ratified by
three-fourths of the state legislatures.</p>
<p>Biden’s proposal is “both a messaging push and a warning to the
Roberts court to clean up its act,” said Democratic Party strategist
Julie Roginsky.</p>
<p>“It underscores the fact that the Supreme Court’s recent decisions
have posed a grave threat to democracy and that the next president will
have an opportunity to shape the court and, with it, the future of our
democracy,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Only 41% of Americans have a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court,
according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in June.</p>
<p>American confidence in the Supreme Court has declined in recent years
as more people see the institution as partisan. A majority of Americans
(53%) say that they think Supreme Court justices rule mainly on the
basis of their partisan political views, according to a 2023 poll by ABC
News/Ipsos, up 10 percentage points from 2022.</p>
<p>Various polls show that voters of both parties are in favor of term
limits for justices, including a Fox News poll in July that show most
Americans strongly favor mandatory retirement.</p>
<p>“Biden’s proposals bundle some of the most popular reforms while
avoiding some of the more politically divisive,” said Chris Jackson,
senior vice president at Ipsos, referring to a court-packing proposal
pushed by some progressives that would expand the size of the Supreme
Court to quickly eliminate the court’s lean to the right.</p>
<p>“It remains to be seen if this will be an effective campaign message
for the Harris campaign heading into the election,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential
nominee, backed Biden’s proposal on Monday.</p>
<p>“President Biden and I strongly believe that the American people must
have confidence in the Supreme Court,” she said in a statement. “Yet
today, there is a clear crisis of confidence facing the Supreme Court as
its fairness has been called into question after numerous ethics
scandals and decision after decision overturning long-standing
precedent.”</p>
<p>Trump, meanwhile, dismissed it.</p>
<p>“It’s going nowhere,” he said in a Fox News interview Monday. “He
knows that, too.”</p>
<p>VOA’s Kim Lewis contributed to this report.</p>

<p>As an experiment, I’ve reduced my coffee-intake to a single cup a day
for about a week now. It’s made an enormous difference in sleep, mood
and energy. I get tired at night, fall asleep quickly, and wake up
refreshed. As mentioned previously in the context of morning sunlight
exposure—another thing that’s aided my sleeping habits, but is somewhat
less practical to sustain as it requires fair weather—I’ve always been
slow to get going in the morning, active at night, bad at getting to bed
at sane hours.</p>

<h2 id="pg_ivm-1.9-released">pg_ivm 1.9 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-31, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of
<a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.9">pg_ivm
1.9</a>.
</p>
<p>
Changes since the v1.8 release include:
</p>
<h3>
Bug fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Add support for PostgreSQL 17 (Yugo Nagata, Takuma Hoshiai, reshke)
</p>
<p>
This contains the following changes:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Change functions to use a safe search_path during maintenance operations
when used with PostgreSQL 17
</p>
<p>
This prevents maintenance operations (automatic maintenance of IMMVs and
refresh_immv) from performing unsafe access. Functions used by IMMVs
that need to reference non-default schemas must specify a search path
during function creation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
refresh_immv can be executed by users with the MAINTAIN privilege when
used with PostgreSQL 17
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
About pg_ivm
</h3>
<p>
pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance
(IVM) feature.
</p>
<p>
Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views
up-to-date in which only incremental changes are computed and applied on
views rather than recomputing. pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate
maintenance, in which materialized views are updated immediately after a
base table is modified.

<h2 id="project-2025-director-leaves-heritage-foundation">Project 2025
director leaves Heritage Foundation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The director of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025
vision for a complete overhaul of the federal government has stepped
down, the conservative think tank confirmed Tuesday. </p>
<p>Paul Dans’ exit comes after the project “completed exactly what it
set out to do: bringing together over 110 leading conservative
organizations to create a unified conservative vision, motivated to
devolve power from the unelected administrative state, and returning it
to the people,” Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said in a
statement. Roberts said the group is sticking to its original
timeline. </p>
<p>The news comes after Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has
increasingly disavowed Project 2025 amid escalating attacks by
Democrats, prompting speculation that Trump’s campaign forced the
exit. </p>
<p>Democrats for the past several months have made Project 2025 a key
election-year cudgel, pointing to the ultraconservative policy blueprint
as a glimpse into how extreme another Trump administration could
be. </p>
<p>The nearly 1,000-page handbook lays out sweeping changes in the
federal government, including altering personnel rules to ensure
government workers are more loyal to the president. </p>
<p>Yet Trump has repeatedly disavowed the document, saying on social
media he hasn’t read it and doesn’t know anything about it. At a rally
in Michigan earlier this month, he said Project 2025 was written by
people on the “severe right” and some of the things in it are “seriously
extreme.” </p>
<p>“President Trump’s campaign has been very clear for over a year that
Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the
campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the
President in any way,” Trump campaign advisers Susie Wiles and Chris
LaCivita said in a statement. “Reports of Project 2025’s demise would be
greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group
trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his
campaign — it will not end well for you.” </p>
<p>Trump campaign representatives did not respond to messages inquiring
about whether the campaign asked or pushed for Dans to step down from
the project. The Heritage Foundation said Dans left voluntarily, and it
was not under pressure from the Trump campaign. Dans didn’t immediately
respond to an emailed request for comment. </p>
<p>But it was almost certain that Trump’s campaign forced the shakeup,
said one former Heritage aide granted anonymity to discuss the
situation. </p>
<p>LaCivita had been aggressively monitoring the situation, the person
said. It was clear that Project 2025 was becoming a liability for Trump
and the party. </p>
<p>For months Trump’s campaign had warned outside groups, and Heritage
in particular, that they did not speak for the former president, even
though the Project 2025 team was staffed with his former White House
aides and advisers. </p>
<p>In an interview from the Republican convention first published by
Politico, LaCivita said Project 2025 was a problem because “the issues
that are going to win us this campaign are not the issues that they want
to talk about.” </p>
<p>Many Trump allies and former top aides contributed to the project,
including Dans, who was a personnel official for the Trump
administration. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign and top Democrats
have repeatedly tied Trump to Project 2025 as they argue against a
second term for the former president. </p>
<p>The Harris campaign said Project 2025 remains linked to Trump’s
agenda. </p>
<p>“Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make
it less real — in fact, it should make voters more concerned about what
else Trump and his allies are hiding,” said Harris for President
Campaign Manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez. </p>
<p>Project 2025’s website will remain live, and the group will continue
vetting resumes for its nearly 20,000-person database of potential
government officials ready to execute the group’s vision for government,
the Heritage Foundation said Tuesday. The group said Roberts will now
run Project 2025 operations.</p>

appears to have violated campaign finance laws with a $25 million super
PAC donation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;
            &lt;div class=&quot;e-content&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
[<a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/coinbase-campaign-finance-violation/">Molly
White</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“With $45.5 million in corporate contributions, American cryptocurrency
exchange Coinbase is the largest donor to Fairshake: a newly-minted
super PAC focused solely on installing political candidates who will be
friendly to the cryptocurrency industry, and ousting those with a
history of pushing for stronger regulations and consumer protections
when it comes to an industry that has long been a regulatory “Wild
West”.”
</p>
<p>
“[Coinbase’s] $25 million contribution, however, appears to be in
violation of federal campaign finance laws that prohibit contributions
from current or prospective federal government contractors. This would
be by far the largest known illegal campaign contribution by a federal
contractor.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Molly points out that there’s a possibility here that Coinbase is using
a loophole that had previously been exploited by Chevron. But it’s
certainly not clear that this is the case.
</p>
<p>
It’s also worth calling out what “candidates who will be friendly to the
cryptocurrency industry” means in practice this election cycle. It’s far
more likely that Trump-aligned candidates will fall into this camp.

images unlock complex history of two near-Earth asteroids</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — In the moments before NASA’s DART spacecraft slammed
into the asteroid Dimorphos in a landmark planetary defense test in
2022, it took high-resolution images of this small celestial object and
its larger companion Didymos. </p>
<p>These images have enabled scientists to unravel the complicated
history of these two rocky bodies located in the vicinity of Earth and
gain insight into the formation of what are called binary asteroid
systems — a primary asteroid with a secondary moonlet orbiting it. </p>
<p>An analysis of the craters and surface strength on Didymos indicated
it formed about 12.5 million years ago. A similar analysis indicated
Dimorphos formed about 300,000 years ago. Didymos probably formed in our
solar system’s main asteroid belt, between the planets Mars and Jupiter,
and then was knocked into the inner solar system, the researchers
said. </p>
<p>An examination of the largest boulders on Didymos and Dimorphos gave
clues about the origins of the two asteroids. </p>
<p>“Both asteroids are aggregates of rocky fragments formed from the
catastrophic destruction of a parent asteroid,” said astronomer Maurizio
Pajola of the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) in Italy, lead
author of one of five studies on the asteroids published on Tuesday in
the journal Nature Communications. </p>
<p>“These large boulders could not have formed from impacts on the
surfaces of Didymos and Dimorphos themselves, as such impacts would have
disintegrated these bodies,” Pajola added. </p>
<p>Didymos, which has a diameter of about a half mile (780 meters), is
classified as a near-Earth asteroid. Dimorphos is roughly 560 feet (170
meters) wide. Both are “rubble pile” asteroids, composed of pieces of
rocky debris that coalesced through the influence of gravity. </p>
<p>“Their surface is covered with boulders. The largest on Dimorphos is
the size of the school bus, while the largest on Didymos is big as
soccer field,” said Olivier Barnouin, a planetary geologist and
geophysicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
in Maryland and lead author of another of the studies. </p>
<p>“There are cracks on the surface and the rocks of Dimorphos, while
Didymos may have finer-grained soils at the equator, although it is
difficult to be sure with the images we have. The surfaces of both
asteroids are weak, much weaker than loose sand,” Barnouin added. </p>
<p>The researchers concluded that Dimorphos is composed of material that
flew off the equatorial region of Didymos due to the speed at which it
was spinning. </p>
<p>“In the case of Didymos, it is thought that in the past, it rotated
faster around its axis due to the YORP effect (spin acceleration driven
by the effect of sunlight on its uneven surface), and thus ejected the
boulders from its equatorial region, forming Dimorphos,” Pajola
added. </p>
<p>Didymos currently spins at a rate of once every 2-1/4 hours. </p>
<p>Few boulders were observed at the equatorial region of Didymos. </p>
<p>“Its equator is much smoother, while mid-latitudes up to the poles
are much rougher, with big boulders sitting on the surface,” Pajola
said. </p>
<p>The U.S. space agency’s DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test)
carried out a proof-of-principle mission, demonstrating that a
spacecraft could apply kinetic force to change the path of a space
object that otherwise might be on a collision course with Earth. Didymos
and Dimorphos do not pose an actual threat to Earth. </p>
<p>DART struck Dimorphos on Sept. 26, 2022, at about 14,000 miles per
hour (22,530 kph) at a distance of roughly 6.8 million miles (11 million
km) from Earth, and succeeded in modestly changing its path. The
collision also slightly changed the shape of Dimorphos. </p>
<p>The DART data has improved the understanding of binary asteroid
systems. </p>
<p>“Binary asteroid systems represent about 10-15% of the total number
of asteroids that are in near-Earth space,” Barnouin said. “More
generally, with every new observation of an asteroid or asteroid system,
we learn more about how asteroids form and evolve. They are complex
systems, but have some key similarities, especially when we consider the
smaller — less than a kilometer (0.62 mile) — asteroids.”</p>

id="nearly-1000-native-american-children-died-in-abusive-us-schools">Nearly
1,000 Native American children died in abusive US schools</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BILLINGS, Montana — At least 973 Native American children died in the
U.S. government’s abusive boarding school system, according to the
results of an investigation released Tuesday by officials who called on
the government to apologize for the schools.</p>
<p>The investigation commissioned by Interior Secretary Deb Haaland
found marked and unmarked graves at 65 of the more than 400 U.S.
boarding schools that were established to forcibly assimilate Native
American children into white society. The findings don’t specify how
each child died, but the causes of death included sickness, accidents
and abuse during a 150-year period that ended in 1969, officials
said.</p>
<p>The findings follow a series of listening sessions across the United
States over the past two years in which dozens of former students
recounted the harsh and often degrading treatment they endured while
separated from their families.</p>
<p>“The federal government — facilitated by the Department I lead — took
deliberate and strategic actions through federal Indian boarding school
policies to isolate children from their families, deny them their
identities, and steal from them the languages, cultures and connections
that are foundational to Native people,” Haaland, a member of the Laguna
Pueblo tribe in New Mexico and the country’s first Native American
Cabinet secretary, said in a news release Tuesday.</p>
<p>In an initial report released in 2022, officials estimated that more
than 500 children died at the schools. The federal government passed
laws and policies in 1819 to support the schools, the last of which were
still operating in the 1960s.</p>
<p>The schools gave Native American children English names, put them
through military drills and forced them to perform manual labor, such as
farming, brickmaking and working on the railroad, officials said.</p>
<p>Former students shared tearful recollections of their experience
during listening sessions in Oklahoma, South Dakota, Michigan, Arizona,
Alaska and other states. They talked about being punished for speaking
their native language, being locked in basements and having their hair
cut to stamp out their identities. They were sometimes subjected to
solitary confinement, beatings and the withholding of food. Many left
the schools with only basic vocational skills that gave them few job
prospects.</p>
<p>Donovan Archambault, 85, of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in
Montana, said he was sent away to boarding schools beginning at age 11
and was mistreated, forced to cut his hair and prevented from speaking
his native language. He said he drank heavily before turning his life
around more than two decades later, and never discussed his school days
with his children until he wrote a book about the experience several
years ago.</p>
<p>“An apology is needed. They should apologize,” Archambault told The
Associated Press by phone Tuesday. “But there also needs to be a broader
education about what happened to us. To me, it’s part of a forgotten
history.”</p>
<p>The new report doesn’t specify who should issue the apology on behalf
of the federal government, saying only that it should be issued through
“appropriate means and officials to demonstrate that it is made on
behalf of the people of the United States and be accompanied by bold and
actionable policies.”</p>
<p>Interior Department officials also recommended that the government
invest in programs that could help Native American communities heal from
the traumas caused by boarding schools. That includes money for
education, violence prevention and the revitalization of indigenous
languages. Spending on those efforts should be on a scale proportional
to the money spent on the schools, agency officials said.</p>
<p>The schools, similar institutions and related assimilation programs
were funded by more than $23 billion in inflation-adjusted federal
spending, officials determined. Religious and private institutions that
ran many of the institutions received federal money as partners in the
campaign to “civilize” Indigenous students, according to the new
report.</p>
<p>By 1926, more than 80% of Indigenous school-age children — some
60,000 children — were attending boarding schools that were run either
by the federal government or religious organizations, according to the
National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.</p>
<p>Legislation pending before Congress would establish a Truth and
Healing Commission to document and acknowledge past injustices related
to boarding schools. The measure is sponsored in the Senate by Democrat
Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and backed by Republican Lisa
Murkowski of Alaska.</p>

id="failures-leading-up-to-attempted-trump-assassination-indefensible-says-acting-secret-service-director">Failures
leading up to attempted Trump assassination indefensible, says acting
Secret Service director</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The acting director of the U.S. agency charged with
protecting high-profile officials called the attempted assassination of
former President Donald Trump this month a “failure on multiple levels,”
describing it as shameful. </p>
<p>Ronald Rowe testified before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday, promising
immediate changes to fix breakdowns in communication and coverage that
allowed a 20-year-old gunman to climb onto the roof of a nearby building
and fire eight shots during the July 13 rally in western Pennsylvania,
killing a rally-goer and wounding Trump and two others. </p>
<p>“What I saw made me ashamed,” he told members of the Senate Homeland
Security and Judiciary committees. “As a career law enforcement officer
and a 25-year veteran with the Secret Service, I cannot defend why that
roof was not better secured.” </p>
<p>Rowe, who took charge of the Secret Service following last week’s
resignation of former director Kimberly Cheatle, appeared to be more
forthcoming than his predecessor, who rankled both Republicans and
Democrats during a hearing last Monday.</p>
<p>Cheatle said the attempted assassination was the “most significant
operational failure” in decades, but repeatedly refused to answer
questions about how the gunman evaded the Secret Service and local law
enforcement agencies despite having been identified as a suspicious
person at least 90 minutes before the rally began.</p>
<p>She resigned the next day.</p>
<p>Rowe told lawmakers Tuesday that the agency’s initial investigation
indicated that a local sniper team had been assigned responsibility for
securing the section of roof used by the shooter. </p>
<p>Those teams should have had a clear view of the shooter as he climbed
into place, he said. </p>
<p>“We were told that building was going to be covered,” Rowe told
lawmakers. “I could not, and I will not, and I cannot understand why
there was not better coverage or at least somebody looking at that roof
line when that’s where they were posted.” </p>
<p>Rowe also admitted that even though local law enforcement had
communicated concerns about the shooter multiple times in the hour and a
half before the rally, that information never got to the Secret Service
agents protecting the former president. </p>
<p>“It appears that that information was stuck or siloed in that state
and local channel,” he said. </p>
<p>“It is troubling,” Rowe said. “We didn’t know that there was this
incident going on. … Nothing about a man on the roof. Nothing about a
man with a gun.” </p>
<p>The acting Secret Service director additionally admitted there were
other holes in the security set-up at the rally, specifically citing the
agency’s inability to put its own drones in the air before the event got
underway due to a lack of mobile connectivity. </p>
<p>It is “something that has cost me a lot of sleep,” Rowe said, noting
the shooter had flown his own drone over the rally site in the hours
before Trump took the stage. </p>
<p>“I have no explanation for it,” he said. “It is something that I feel
as though we could have perhaps found him. We could have maybe stopped
him.” </p>
<p>“Maybe on that particular day he would have decided this isn’t the
day to do it, because law enforcement just found me flying my
drone.” </p>
<p>Rowe even promised lawmakers that the Secret Service would be adding
range finders, like the one the shooter was seen carrying, to the list
of items prohibited at rallies and other events, going forward. </p>
<p>‘People will be held accountable’</p>
<p>Despite the admissions, some lawmakers were not satisfied. </p>
<p>“My question is, why don’t you relieve everybody of duty who made [a]
bad judgment?” asked Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley. “What more
do you need to investigate to know that there were critical failures
that some individuals should be held accountable?” </p>
<p>“This could have been our Texas School Book Depository,” Rowe
responded, referring to the 1963 assassination of U.S. President John F.
Kennedy. </p>
<p>“I have lost sleep over that for the last 17 days,” Rowe said. “I
will tell you, Senator, that I will not rush to judgment, that people
will be held accountable, and I will do so with integrity.” </p>
<p>‘Nothing has been ruled out’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the shooter, Thomas
Matthew Crooks, has yet to determine why he tried to kill the former
president. </p>
<p>FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate told lawmakers on Tuesday that the
bureau has conducted more than 460 interviews but has so far come up
empty. </p>
<p>“The investigation has not identified a motive, nor any
coconspirators or others with advance knowledge,” said Abbate. 
“Absolutely nothing has been ruled out.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the deputy FBI director said a newly discovered social media
account used in 2019-2020 may shed some new light on the shooter’s
motivation.</p>
<p>“There were over 700 comments posted from this account,” he told
lawmakers. “Some of these comments, if ultimately attributable to the
shooter, appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to
espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature.” </p>
<p>“While the investigative team is still working to verify this account
to determine if it did in fact belong to the shooter, we believe it
important to share it … particularly given the general absence of other
information to date from social media and other sources of information
that reflect on the shooter’s potential motive and mindset.” </p>
<p>If verified, however, the newly discovered social media account would
stand in contrast to an account on Gab, a social media platform popular
with the far right, that might also be linked to Crooks. </p>
<p>The Gab account, according to the FBI and Gab officials, espoused
pro-immigration views and endorsed other left-leaning policies. </p>
<p>Only the acting secret service director suggested the inconsistencies
ultimately might not matter. </p>
<p>“We have an individual who was focused on Donald Trump and Joe
Biden,” Rowe said, noting similarities between Crooks and John Hinckley
Jr., who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. </p>
<p>“Hinckley traveled the ’80 campaign, and we know that he followed
President [Jimmy] Carter,” he said. In “March of ’81, he happened to
show up in Washington, D.C., and he saw an opportunity to try to attack
President Reagan.” </p>
<p>FBI officials, who briefed reporters on Monday, described Crooks as
an intelligent loner and said it appears he “made significant efforts to
conceal his activities,” which may have begun more than a year ago. </p>
<p>Investigators said that is when he began using encrypted email
accounts and aliases to make online, gun-related purchases, followed by
a series of online purchases of chemicals to make the three explosive
devices found in his car and bedroom. </p>
<p>Crooks also began to do internet searches on mass shootings, power
plants, a variety of elected officials and attempted
assassinations. </p>
<p>They also noted a lack of communication between the shooter and
others, in general. </p>
<p>“We have identified only a couple people who we would call his
friends, and most of those contacts were, in fact, dated,” said FBI
Special Agent Kevin Rojek. </p>
<p>Rojek added that even the shooter’s accounts on gaming platforms
showed “very little interaction,” describing it as outside the norm.</p>

<h2 id="the-climate-cost-of-the-permitting-deal">The Climate Cost of the
Permitting Deal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mjk5MDgxNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MTc1NTcyOH0.NUXPI_Njn5GrEHTAmX9vTa87OjMKUiOHIleZ6MCONpg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Senator Joe Manchin’s new permitting deal is the best shot Congress will
get this year to boost transmission and renewables. It may also lock in
generations of future fossil fuel production and exports.
</p>
<p>
To many climate activists, that’s not a trade worth making.
</p>
<p>
Tomorrow, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will vote on
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/services/files/744DC0D2-F3C0-4FE7-AD72-895D8517EBE4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
deal</u></a> Manchin struck with the panel’s top Republican, John
Barrasso, that couples faster transmission and renewable energy
approvals and restrictions on litigation with much stronger requirements
for regular oil, gas, and coal lease sales on federal lands. It would
also restrict the Energy Department from continuing
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-1-lng" target="_self"><u>its
pause</u></a> on liquified natural gas export terminal approvals (an
action that has already been overturned in court) and also, activists
note, potentially bar the federal government from having authority over
oil and gas drill sites on private lands. Critics say this would take
away a tool regulators in Washington can use to require a well — a
<a href="https://www.kunr.org/energy-and-environment/2023-06-13/abandoned-oil-gas-wells-leak-cancer-causing-toxic-gasses-study" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>potential
source</u></a> of methane, the hyper-potent greenhouse gas — be plugged
in the event the owner goes bankrupt and abandons the site.
</p>
<p>
The environmentalist reaction to the bill has been swift and loud, with
a broad swath of organizations coming out fiercely against its passage.
Even some groups seen as more business-friendly, such as the
Environmental Defense Fund, praised the transmission bits while
<a href="https://www.edf.org/media/energy-permitting-reform-must-advance-climate-progress-and-community-safeguards" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>calling
out</u></a> “permitting proposals drafted without meaningful
consultation of frontline communities” and proclaiming the fossil fuel
language objectionable.
</p>
<p>
In a development that has quietly befuddled activists, a growing number
of climate-friendly Democrats are coming out in favor of the
legislation. Senators John Hickenlooper and Martin Heinrich, whose
transmission proposals landed in the deal, are likely to vote in favor
of the bill in committee this week.
</p>
<p>
“This legislation is our opportunity to unlock an American-made clean
energy future,” Heinrich told
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/a-top-senate-democrat-backs-manchins-permitting-plan/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Politico</em></em></u><u>’s
</u><u><em><em>E&amp;E News</em></em></u></a> in a statement last week.
“It will create good-paying jobs, grow our workforce, and help us
deliver affordable and reliable electricity to all Americans — all while
helping to meet our ambitious and urgent climate goals.”
</p>
<p>
Fossil fuels produced on federal lands for energy represent
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03302-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
substantial portion</u></a> of the greenhouse gas emissions produced by
the United States, a fact even Biden regulators
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-joe-biden-oil-gas-public-land-environment-4d2c446ee78f6ed172f28f0fa01c6826" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have
acknowledged</u></a> while allowing more sales.
</p>
<p>
Whether this legislation can get to a full vote in the Senate is far
from certain, and it’s a longshot for passage in this Congress. The bill
goes further in favor of fossil fuels than the
<a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2022/9/manchin-releases-comprehensive-permitting-reform-text-to-be-included-in-continuing-resolution" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2022
Manchin permitting deal</u></a>, which was blocked by a confluence of
opposition from environmentalists and far-right legislators that wanted
an even more aggressive approach to overhauling environmental laws.
</p>
<p>
The same sort of coalition could stall this bill. But it would not
surprise me if many more Democrats added their voices and votes in
support. Over my years of reporting in Congress, I found a growing sense
of frustration in Democratic circles at the lack of shovel-ready
projects funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. They blame the National
Environmental Policy Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and
pencil-pushing government officials. They’re tired of being asked “will
they or won’t they” questions by Hill reporters about an ever-elusive
permitting deal. So they may take any leap of faith to see those visual
victories come to fruition faster — and help shore up political support
for keeping the landmark climate law in place.
</p>
<p>
But that’s not how climate activists want them to see the bill. At all.
</p>
<p>
“Honestly, the amount of fossil fuels that can be deployed out of this
far outweighs to me the gains we would get in transmission,” Johanna
Bozuwa, executive director of the Climate and Community Project, told
me. “I can understand the ‘for’ side of this. People are frustrated and
they are sick of transmission not being deployed. Whereas the people who
are against this bill are like, you need to think about the
ramifications right now. Because what is being built into this bill is
not next year’s emissions. It’s thirty years of emissions.”
</p>
<h3>
What’s in the bill
</h3>
<p>
Under Manchin-Barrasso, it would be much harder for the federal
government to reduce how much land and sea it sells to fossil fuel
companies every year.
</p>
<p>
The federal government regularly offers land for oil and gas companies
to purchase for drilling sites. Deciding what land to sell and how much
acreage to offer is normally a process decided at the bureaucratic level
in tandem with industry input and environmental analyses. Under the
Trump administration,
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/oil-gas-permits-leases-surged-from-final-obama-year-through-trump-years-63204116" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lease
sales were plentiful</u></a>, though some had to be canceled because of
inadequate
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/judge-axes-trump-era-lease-sales-to-protect-sage-grouse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate
and species reviews</u></a>. Biden’s gone the opposite direction, but in
order to win Manchin’s crucial vote, the IRA also complicated efforts to
wind down fossil fuel auctions. One of Manchin’s non-negotiables for
passing the bill was tying renewables leasing to millions of acres in
mandatory oil and gas lease sales. In other words, to sell land for
renewables, the government must now sell fossil fuels too.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the IRA required the government to sell either millions of
acres or the acreage that industry expresses interest in. So far, the
Interior Department has found wiggle room by saying the acres they sell
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/policy/im-2023-006" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>do
not need to align</u></a> precisely with properties requested by
developers. Some in the oil and gas industry have accused the Biden
administration of deliberately
<a href="https://wyofile.com/feds-offer-only-20-tracts-in-wyoming-oil-and-gas-lease-sale-notably-fewer-than-under-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offering
land</u></a> the industry doesn’t want.
</p>
<p>
What Manchin-Barrasso would do, activists say, is essentially tie the
hands of the government on this requirement. One provision would insert
the phrase “for which expressions of interest have been submitted” into
the mandatory onshore oil and gas leasing totals in the IRA, in effect
putting industry’s desired land for leasing into statute as a
requirement.
</p>
<p>
The bill would also require the government to hold annual offshore oil
and gas lease sales at a time when the Biden administration
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/042524-us-interiors-5-year-lease-plan-for-offshore-wind-raises-oil-auction-concerns" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is
non-committal</u></a> about auctioning in certain future years before
environmental analyses are conducted.
</p>
<p>
There’s also the part about drilling on private land. A provision in
Manchin-Barrasso appears to ban the federal government from requesting
applications for permits to drill on private lands in circumstances when
the government owns only the minerals beneath the surface but not above.
These applications,
<a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/oil-and-gas/operations-and-production/permitting/applications-permits-drill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>known
as APDs</u></a>, are a key opportunity for federal regulators to require
project developers post a bond on oil and gas wells as well as provide
at least some level of info on environmental mitigation measures.
Advocates emphasize this input also comes with an opportunity to
intervene when an operator goes bankrupt and leaves a well unplugged,
<a href="https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/2023/01/24/pa-drillers-abandoned-thousands-of-natural-gas-wells-in-5-years-ignored-state-law-report-says/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>puking
methane into the atmosphere</u></a>. Manchin-Barrasso would instead cede
that authority entirely to the states.
</p>
<p>
The bill would also require the government to process applications for
<em><em>coal</em></em> leasing when the Biden administration is trying,
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/16/1251856806/biden-ending-new-leases-in-americas-top-coal-region" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>essentially,
to stop such leasing altogether</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Plus there’s the LNG export language which, well, explains itself.
</p>
<h3>
Deal or no deal
</h3>
<p>
For the energy transition, the bill would: create timetables for
permitting renewables on federal rights-of-way; allow minimal
environmental reviews of “low-disturbance” renewables construction
projects; set a national goal of 50 gigawatts of renewables on federal
land by 2030; ease geothermal permitting; provide easier environmental
reviews to certain transmission activities within recently approved
rights-of-way; grant FERC more authority to greenlight transmission
projects that are considered to be in the “national interest;” and give
hydropower projects more lenience on license extensions.
</p>
<p>
To some, that might be a worthwhile compromise — in the world of the
possible, the deal may be the biggest opportunity for real gains on
transmission and renewables this Congress. Should the November elections
swing in the GOP’s direction, Democrats seeking a less fossil-friendly
permitting deal would have essentially no chance because they could lose
the House, the Senate <em><em>and </em></em>the White House, making this
the only game in town, potentially for a long time. This bill would also
achieve the elusive dream of a bipartisan compromise, where both sides
get some but not all of what they want to achieve incremental progress
on something viewed in D.C. as a long bemoaned problem.
</p>
<p>
“It is a really good bipartisan deal,” Xan Fishman of the Bipartisan
Policy Center told me last week. “Not everyone is going to be happy.”
</p>
<p>
That argument isn’t convincing Rep. Jared Huffman, a top Democrat on the
House Natural Resources Committee, who has emerged as a vocal critic of
the Senate legislation. Huffman told me he wants to see transmission
boosted “without massive giveaways to the fossil fuel industry.” When
asked if he’s comfortable with accusations he’s holding up a bipartisan
compromise, he simply said, “Whatever.”
</p>
<p>
“This is a bad deal. It just goes way too far in the direction of oil,
gas and coal,” he told me. “We’ve got to stop dignifying this notion
that to take one step forward on clean energy, we’ve got to take two
steps backward on fossil fuel production.”
</p>
<p>
Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological
Diversity, noted to me that when the Inflation Reduction Act was passed
into law, Democrats had analyses showing the potential decarbonization
benefits of the legislation — oil and gas warts and all. It ultimately
showed net wins on climate, no matter how hard the other stuff may have
been to swallow.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s the math that proves this is good?” he asked of the
Manchin-Barrasso bill.
</p>
<p>
The truth is, we don’t know the climate impacts of this legislation yet,
though experts are at work poring over the details. Meanwhile, some
climate advocates are trying to get their own math out there. At the
start of the week, I attended a small roundtable discussion with Jeremy
Symons, a longtime environmental advocate who once worked on the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as representatives of
Public Citizen and Earthjustice and other reporters from Politico and
S&amp;P Global. At that roundtable, Symons presented an analysis
declaring the legislation’s impact on LNG exports reviews alone would be
equivalent to that from 165 coal-fired power plants and that it would
take roughly 50 large renewable electricity-powered transmission lines
to make up the negative climate impacts of the provision.
</p>
<p>
“Lawmakers should do some deep dive reevaluation and reach out to other
outside experts to make sure that they fully understand [this bill],”
Tyson Slocum of Public Citizen said at the roundtable.
</p>
<p>
Manchin’s office did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Media Made Deal Involving GOP Donor James E. Davison</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class=&quot;known-bookmark&quot;&gt;

<p>
[<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-media-truth-social-jedtec-james-davison-conflict-of-interest">Justin
Elliott, Robert Faturechi and Alex Mierjeski at ProPublica</a>]
</p>
<p>
The majority of Donald Trump’s net worth is wrapped up in Truth Social’s
parent company Trump Media &amp; Technology Group. If he’s elected, its
deals and ownership structure will present conflicts of interests -
illustrated by this ProPublica investigation into its streaming TV deal:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The deal announced by Trump Media involves a series of largely unknown
small players. Trump Media’s disclosures about the deal describe a
nesting doll of companies that leave many questions unanswered about its
new business partners.”
</p>
<p>
“The sellers include a pair of Louisiana companies: [major Republican
donor James E.] Davison’s JedTec LLC along with another called
WorldConnect IPTV Solutions.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
JedTec’s issues are relatively straightforward. For me, the bigger
mystery surrounds WorldConnect IPTV, which seems to be acting as a
wrapper around a UK streaming company called
<a href="https://www.perception.tv/">Perception Group</a>. In turn,
Perception’s servers seem to be colocated with
<a href="https://he.net/">Hurricane Electric</a>, a backbone provider
based in Fremont.
</p>
<p>
Perception seems like a bit of a mystery operation in itself: there’s
very little information on its website that really illuminates if
there’s any new technology here at all. WorldConnect, meanwhile, seems
to have spent many of its early years helping right-wing Christian TV
stations reach audiences across the UK’s Freeview over-the-air digital
TV service and the internet at large.
</p>
<p>
It’s all super-strange. There’s definitely more to discover.

<blockquote>
<p>
“Perplexity’s “Publishers’ Program” has recruited its first batch of
partners, including prominent names like Time, Der Spiegel, Fortune,
Entrepreneur, The Texas Tribune, and Automattic (with WordPress.com
participating but not Tumblr). Under this program, when Perplexity
features content from these publishers in response to user queries, the
publishers will receive a share of the ad revenue.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now we’re talking. This was inevitable.
</p>
<p>
It also opens the floodgates: there’s a world where <em>any</em>
publisher gets a direct revenue share for being a source, if they sign
up and license their content. This seems like a solid improvement.
</p>
<p>
Which brings me to Automattic’s involvement. As Matt Mullenweg says in
the piece:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“It’s a much better revenue split than Google, which is zero.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Automattic will actually be sharing the revenue with customers of its
hosted WordPress product. I’m not sure if that includes WordPress VIP,
its premium product for publishers. Whether free hosted WordPress
publishers who are used as sources by Perpexity see any kind of revenue
share is also a mystery, which might put some foreign publishers in a
bad place in particular.
</p>
<p>
Still, in general, although there will certainly be kinks to work out,
this sets a really good precedent. More, please.

<h2>
THE TOP FIVE
</h2>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>European clean energy companies weigh their futures in the U.S.
ahead of the presidential election
</h3>
<p>
European companies are considering whether to invest in new clean energy
projects in the U.S. as November’s election looms,
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/trump-effect-clean-tech-sector-deepens-angst-europes-boardrooms-2024-07-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Reuters
</em></em></u><u>reported on Monday</u></a>. The Inflation Reduction
Act’s incentives for clean energy, EVs, and hydrogen – which drew many
European firms to cross the Atlantic – are perceived to be in jeopardy
in the event of a Trump victory. Companies like Thyssenkrupp Nucera,
Nel, SMA Solar, and H2Apex, which have undertaken clean energy projects
in the U.S. in the last two years, are all delaying investment decisions
over worries that tax credits and demand could dry up.
</p>
<p>
Their concerns are warranted. Donald Trump has pledged to
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/29/biden-climate-spending-trump-2024-00171593" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>redirect
clean energy</u></a> funding to other priorities like roads and bridges
should he win re-election. And the Heritage Foundation’s <em><em>Project
2025</em></em> (widely seen as a policy map for a second Trump term)
proposes gutting key climate agencies like the Environmental Protection
Agency and the Department of Energy’s Loans Program Office.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Nuclear fusion company concludes giant funding round
</h3>
<p>
Type One Energy closed its seed funding round at $82.5 million, a
testament to the hype surrounding the emerging nuclear fusion company.
As
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/type-one-fusion-seed-round" target="_self"><u>Heatmap’s
Katie Brigham reports</u></a>, the company uses a reactor design known
as a stellarator, which – unlike the traditional tokamak reactor –
employs a twisted magnetic field to keep the plasma stabilized inside.
The company’s novel technology sparked interest from major funders like
Breakthrough Energy, Centaurus Capital, and New Zealand-based GD1. Type
One CEO Chris Mowry called the funding round, “one of the largest, if
not the largest ever, seed financings in the history of energy.”
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Gas flaring in Azerbaijan hits a decadal high
</h3>
<p>
The host of the UN COP29 climate summit flared 10.5% more methane in
2023 than it did in 2018, the last time the country reported its
emissions,
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/374762d3-9169-4423-8a3e-6f262491b3fb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to recent analysis</u></a> by nonprofit group Global Witness. Flaring
involves burning (rather than capturing) the natural gas produced as a
byproduct of oil drilling, and it is responsible for over 381 million
metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions annually, according to the World
Bank. Several of the facilities most at fault for the increase in
flaring are owned or operated by British multinational energy company
BP.
</p>
<p>
It’s a new black mark on Azerbaijan’s climate record, already under
scrutiny by those who object to holding another climate conference in a
major oil and gas-producing country.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Wildfires are hurting the U.S. economy
</h3>
<p>
A forthcoming report by economic analysis group IMPLAN finds that
wildfires could punch a nearly $90 billion hole in U.S. economic output
this year. Wildfires are already displacing entire communities as they
rage across much of the American West. That’s going to have an impact,
says IMPLAN — potentially eliminating as many as 466,000 jobs by the end
of the year. The report notes that some industries may actually benefit
from the surge in wildfires. Businesses like electricity, healthcare,
and (of course) fire prevention could see elevated spending as climate
change increases the frequency of these destructive blazes.
</p>
<h3>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>A new study casts doubt on forests’ ability to curb emissions
</h3>
<p>
Vegetation isn’t acting as the carbon sponge many had hoped it would. A
new study by the French research organization Laboratory for Climate and
Environmental Sciences (LCES) found that between 2022 and 2023, the
growth rate of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased 86%. That’s
partly because drought in the Amazon and wildfires in Canada constrained
forests’ ability to sequester carbon as they normally do. While the
report’s authors noted that carbon uptake changes from year to year,
these findings cast doubt on forests’ reliability as a carbon sponge in
the future. “We are pumping less carbon from the atmosphere into the
land,” one of the study’s authors
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/worlds-forests-failed-curb-2023-climate-emissions-study-finds-2024-07-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
</u><u><em><em>Reuters</em></em></u></a>. “Suddenly the pump is choking,
and it’s pumping less.”

One Energy Raised $82.5 Million to Do Fusion For Real</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The fusion world is flush in cash and hype, as the dream of
near-limitless clean energy inches closer to reality.
<a href="https://www.fusionindustryassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-global-fusion-industry-report-FIA.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A
recent report</u></a> from the Fusion Industry Association found that in
the last two years, companies in the industry have brought in over $2.3
billion, nearly a third of all fusion funding since 1992.
</p>
<p>
Today, one of those companies, Type One Energy, announced a giant, $82.5
million seed funding round, which CEO Chris Mowry told me is “one of the
largest, if not the largest ever, seed financings in the history of
energy.” This funding represents the total from the company’s first
close in March of last year, which brought in $29 million, plus the
recent close of its extension round, which brought in an additional
$53.5 million. The extension was co-led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures,
New Zealand-based venture capital firm GD1, and Centaurus Capital.
</p>
<p>
Mowry said the follow-on funding is necessary for the company to achieve
its target of commercializing fusion by the mid-2030s. “To do this, we
need to ramp this company up pretty quickly and have some pretty
ambitious milestones in terms of development of the actual pilot power
plant. And that takes a lot of capital,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
Type One uses a reactor design known as a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsstellarators#:~:text=A%20stellarator%20is%20a%20machine,a%20donut%2C%20called%20a%20torus." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>stellarator</u></a>.
The concept is similar to the more familiar doughnut-shaped
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainstokamaks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tokamak
reactors</u></a>, used by the deep-pocketed MIT-spinoff Commonwealth
Fusion Systems and the intergovernmental fusion megaproject ITER. Both
stellarators and tokamaks use high-powered magnets to confine
superheated plasma, in which the fusion reaction takes place. But unlike
the symmetrical magnetic field created by a tokamak, a stellarator
creates a twisted magnetic field that is more adept at keeping the
plasma stabilized, though historically at the expense of keeping it
maximally hot.
</p>
<p>
Recent progress in the stellarator universe has Mowry excited, as the
world’s largest stellarator, developed at the Max Planck Institute for
Plasma Physics in Germany, has demonstrated high heating power as well
as the ability to maintain a fusion plasma for a prolonged period of
time. Thus, he told me this tech has “no fundamental science or
engineering barriers to commercialization,” and that if the German
stellarator were simply scaled up, it could likely provide sustained
fusion energy for a power plant, albeit at a price point that would be
totally unfeasible. Commercialization is therefore now simply an
“engineering optimization challenge.”
</p>
<p>
The Type One team is composed of some of the world’s foremost experts on
stellarator fusion, coming from the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
which Mowry said “built the world’s first modern stellarator;” Oak Ridge
National Laboratory; and the Institute for Plasma Physics. The company
plans to use the additional funding to jumpstart its FusionDirect
program, which involves building a prototype reactor in partnership with
Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Tennessee Valley Authority, the
nation’s largest public utility. The timeline is aggressive — Type One
is aiming to complete the prototype by the end of 2028. And while this
machine will not generate fusion energy, its purpose is to validate the
design concept for the company’s pilot plant, which will ideally begin
putting fusion electrons on the grid by the mid-2030s.
</p>
<p>
Mowry’s goal is to enter into a public-private partnership by the end of
the decade that will help get the company’s first-of-its-kind
stellarator pilot off the ground. The government has an integral role to
play in helping fusion energy reach scale, he argued, but said that as
of now, it’s not doing nearly enough. Federal funding for fusion, he
told me, is “on the order of a billion dollars a year.” While that might
seem like a hefty sum, Mowry said only a minuscule portion is allotted
to commercialization initiatives as opposed to basic research and
development, a breakdown “aligned with where fusion was in the 20th
century,” he told me, not where it is today.
</p>
<p>
If Type One’s pilot plant works as hoped, “then you’re talking about
deploying the first wave of full-scale, truly commercial fusion power
plants in the second half of the 2030s.” Which, when it comes to
preventing catastrophic climate change, is “maybe just in time.”

ordered by judge to craft plan in support of Jewish students</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES — A federal judge ordered Monday that the University of
California, Los Angeles, craft a plan to protect Jewish students, months
after pro-Palestinian protests broke out on campus.</p>
<p>Three Jewish students sued the university in June, alleging that they
experienced discrimination on campus amid demonstrations against the
Israel-Hamas war. Yitzchok Frankel, a UCLA law student who is Jewish,
said in the lawsuit that he declined an invitation from the director of
student life to help host a lunch gathering because he did not feel safe
participating.</p>
<p>“Under ordinary circumstances, I would have leapt at the chance to
participate in this event,” Frankel said. “My Jewish identity and
religion are integral to who I am, and I believe it is important to
mentor incoming students and encourage them to be proud of their
Judaism, too.”</p>
<p>But Frankel argued UCLA was failing to foster a safe environment for
Jewish students on campus.</p>
<p>UCLA spokesperson Mary Osako said the school is “committed to
maintaining a safe and inclusive campus, holding those who engaged in
violence accountable, and combatting antisemitism in all forms.”</p>
<p>“We have applied lessons learned from this spring’s protests and
continue to work to foster a campus culture where everyone feels welcome
and free from intimidation, discrimination and harassment,” Osako said
in a statement.</p>
<p>The University was ordered to craft a proposed plan by next
month.</p>
<p>The demonstrations at UCLA became part of a movement at campuses
across the country against the Israel-Hamas war. At UCLA, law
enforcement ordered in May that over a thousand protesters break up
their encampment as tensions rose on campus. Counter-demonstrators had
attacked the encampment overnight, and at least 15 protesters suffered
injuries. In June, dozens of protesters on campus were arrested after
they tried to set up a new encampment.</p>
