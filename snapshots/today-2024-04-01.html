<h2 id="a-deep-dive-into-email-deliverability-in-2024">A deep dive into
email deliverability in 2024</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>On October 3, 2023, Google and Yahoo announced upcoming email
security standards to prevent spam, phishing and malware attempts.
Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) is also enforcing these policies. With
the big 3 Email Service Providers (ESP) in agreement, expect widespread
adoption soon. Today’s threats are more complex than ever and more ESPs
will begin tightening the reigns. Failure to comply with these
guidelines will result in emails being blocked beginning April 2024. In
this article, we’re going to cover these guidelines and explain what
senders must do in order to achieve and maintain compliance. ↫ XOMedia
Some of these changes – most of them impact bulk senders and spammers –
should’ve been implemented ages ago, but seeing them being pushed by the
three major email providers, who all happened to be owned, of course, by
massive corporations, does raise quite a few red flags. Instinctively,
this makes me worried about ulterior motives, especially since running
your own email server is already fraught with issues due to the nebulous
ways Gmail treats emails coming from small servers. With the rising
interest in self-hosting and things like Mastodon, I hope we’re also
going to see a resurgence in hosting your own e-mail. I really don’t
like that all my email is going through Gmail – it’s what OSNews uses –
but I don’t feel like dealing with all the delivery issues people who
try self-hosting email lament about. With a possible renewed wave of
interest in it, we might be able to make the process easier and more
reliable.</p>

legislation to stop surprise medical bills worked?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
We’ve been taking a close look on this program at the burdens of medical
debt. Back in 2020, Congress passed the so-called “No Surprises Act” to
protect patients from unexpected big bills for out-of-network medical
care — and turns out, its wider impact on health care spending has
yielded mixed results. But first on the show, California’s new
$20-an-hour minimum wage for fast food goes into effect today. We’ll
unpack reactions.

hard-reload the page to get the new version. So, when I post this on

<p>I tried
<a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/kara-swishers-tech-love-story/">listening</a>
to one of Kara Swisher’s interviews for her new book. The interviewer
was someone I respect, Brian Lehrer at WNYC. But he has an old and imho
unfair view that CraigsList and Facebook are responsible for the demise
of local news. I was surprised when he said as much near the start of
the interview. Then Swisher went into an obviously very well rehearsed
schpiel that confirmed that he was absolutely right and the tech gods
weren’t fooling anyone. OK that was my limit, I switched to another
podcast. She’s got a great business model. Tell the press what they want
to hear and you will get good press, pretty much guaranteed.</p>

to separate Teams and Office globally amid antitrust scrutiny</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Microsoft will sell its chat and video app Teams separately from its
Office product globally, the U.S. tech giant said on Monday, six months
after it unbundled the two products in Europe in a bid to avert a
possible EU antitrust fine. The European Commission has been
investigating Microsoft’s tying of Office and Teams since a 2020
complaint by Salesforce-owned competing workspace messaging app Slack. ↫
Foo Yun Chee at Reuters I honestly misread this as Microsoft selling
Teams off, which would’ve been far bigger news. Unbundling Teams from
Office globally is just Microsoft applying its recent European Union
policy to the rest of the world. All we need now is Microsoft to stop
trying to make Teams for families and friends happen, because nobody
will ever want to use Teams for anything, let alone personal use.</p>

<p>Every computer has at least one heart which beats the cadence to all
the other chips. The CloCK output pin is connected to a copper line
which spreads to most components, into their CLK input pin. If you are
mostly a software person like me, you may have never noticed it but all
kinds of processors have a CLK input pin. From CPUs (Motorola 68000,
Intel Pentium, MOS 6502), to custom graphic chips (Midway’s DMA2, Capcom
CPS-A/CPS-B, Sega’s Genesis VDP) to audio chips (Yamaha 2151, OKI
msm6295), they all have one. ↫ Fabien Sanglard I’ve watched enough

<li>Contamination fears in Baltimore
</h3>
<p>
Environmental experts are concerned that the ongoing removal of wreckage
from Baltimore’s collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge could cause oil or
other hazardous materials to spill into the Patapsco River. Authorities
have deployed nearly a mile’s worth of protective and absorbent barriers
into the water, the
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/maryland-baltimore-key-bridge-collapse-environment-1543f7a560b9e109761d9f89cdbab9b9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Associated
Press</em> reports</a>, though a U.S. Coast Guard spokesperson
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/officials-baltimore-harbor-spill-not-an-immediate-threat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said
Friday</a> that “no immediate threat to the environment” had been
identified. The cargo ship that struck the bridge was carrying at least
56 containers with hazardous materials, 14 of which were destroyed. A
breach of the ship’s hull at any point during the cleanup process could
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/30/baltimore-bridge-collapse-environment-hazard" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leak
fuel oil</a> into the water, but at present, the hull looks to be
intact.

<li>Vermont could be the first state to pass a climate superfund bill

<p>
The Vermont Senate approved amendments on Friday to a bill that would
seek compensation from fossil fuel companies for the impacts of climate
change,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/climate-superfund-vermont" target="_self">Heatmap’s
Emily Pontecorvo reports</a>. Vermont’s climate superfund bill — one of
several to have been introduced in state legislatures in recent years —
would authorize the state to determine the cost it has borne from the
extraction and combustion of fossil fuels over the past three decades
and then ask responsible parties to pay up. (Vermont plans to focus its
efforts on the world’s biggest emitters.) Modeled after federal
Superfund law that keeps companies on the hook for cleaning up
contamination, Vermont’s bill and others like it face an uncertain
future and inevitable legal challenges.

<li>Study: Climate change is making heat waves sluggish
</h3>
<p>
Heat waves are moving slower, traveling farther, and lasting longer, a
<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adl1598" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new
study</a> found. Scientists have known for a long time that climate
change is exacerbating heat waves, but the new study, published Friday
in the journal <em>Science Advances</em>, determined that heat waves’
movement has slowed by 20% since 1979 — a decline of about 5 miles per
day each decade. They’ve also gotten longer and more frequent. Wei
Zhang, a climate scientist at Utah State University and one of the
study’s authors, is particularly concerned about the effects of

Coal Was Destined for India. Now It’s Polluting the Air in

<p class="drop-caps">
For those living near the Port of Baltimore, the transportation and
storage of coal on its way from mines in the Appalachian Mountains to
far-flung foreign kilns is “a mundane but ever-present imposition,”
Chloe Ahmann, a Cornell University anthropologist, told me. Ahmann once
worked as an elementary school teacher in Curtis Bay, a residential
neighborhood adjacent to the working port, and wrote a book on the
area’s
<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo215474590.html" target="_blank">post-industrial
present</a>.
</p>
<p>
“There are stories going back generation,” she said. “Coal dust covering
everything in the neighborhood — bicycles, porches, windowsill. People
wipe coal dust off their windows as a daily ritual.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
With the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge and subsequent
shutdown of the port, that coal now has nowhere to go for the
foreseeable future. Baltimoreans don’t want it, but its intended
recipients thousands of miles away in India most certainly
do.<br/><br/>“The top recipient of U.S. steam coal shipped from
Baltimore by far over the past five years has been India, where the
brick manufacturing industry has been a major customer,” the U.S. Energy
Information Administration said in a
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61663" target="_blank">report</a>
on the impacts of the bridge disaster. In January alone, the Port of
Baltimore exported almost a million tons of coal to India, up almost
three-fold from January of last year,
<a href="https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2551775-stuck-baltimore-coal-may-raise-prices-in-india-europe" target="_blank">according
to Argus</a>, a commodity data provider. In total, 17 million tons of
thermal coal — the type used in power plants and brick kilns — left the
U.S. via Baltimore in 2023, S&amp;P Global
<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/020724-us-thermal-coal-exports-jump-264-on-year-to-44-million-mt-in-2023-census" target="_blank">found</a>
by analyzing Census Bureau data.
</p>
<p>
India is the world’s
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/coal-2023/demand" target="_blank">second
largest consumer of coal</a> after China, and coal accounts for over 70%
of India’s emissions from burning fuel, according to the International
Energy Agency. (In contrast,
<a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/united-states/emissions" target="_blank">coal
accounts for a fifth of the United States’ emissions from
combustion</a>.) About a quarter of India’s emissions come from
industry, much of which uses coal in its processes, including
steelmaking, and cement and, yes, brick manufacturing.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Brickmaking in India is often done on small scales by local producers,
but even so, its energy consumption is “comparable to the organized
construction industries such as cement and steel,” according to research
published in <em>Nature India</em>. Many of those bricks are used to
build homes, part and parcel of the country’s astounding economic
growth. Along with its steel and cement industries, brickmaking has
transformed India —
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank?tab=table" target="_blank">whose
inflation-adjusted per capita GDP of around $1,800</a> in 1990 would
have made it one of the world’s poorest countries today — into the
third-largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The same brick industry that produces the literal building
blocks of India’s homebuilding sector is also responsible for immensely
damaging particulate pollution. The combination of coal and biomass used
to fire brick kilns is responsible for around
<a href="https://www.ccacoalition.org/projects/improving-worker-skills-transform-indias-brick-sector#:~:text=Brick%20kilns%20emit%20approximately%2066,and%20sulfur%20dioxide%20air%20pollution." target="_blank">75
million tons of carbon dioxide emissions</a> — comparable to the total
emissions of Washington State, Arizona, or the 2021 California wildfires
— and 100,000 tons of black carbon emissions, according to the Climate
and Clean Air Coalition.
</p>
<p>
Air pollution in South Asia is one of the largest public health problems
in the world. India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh all ranked in the
<a href="https://epi.yale.edu/epi-results/2022/component/air" target="_blank">bottom
10 of 180 countries</a> for air quality, according to the Yale
University Environmental Performance Index. In 2019, air pollution was
estimated to account for
<a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/nation-world-society/international/air-pollution-in-inda.html#:~:text=Air%20pollution%20in%20India%20resulted,at%20Boston%20College%2C%20the%20Indian" target="_blank">around
1.7 million premature deaths</a> in India. “Brick kilns, involving the
burning of low-grade coal, are one of the major sectors that contribute
to air pollution in South Asia,” a
<a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/685751588227715919/pdf/Dirty-Stacks-High-Stakes-An-Overview-of-Brick-Sector-in-South-Asia.pdf" target="_blank">World
Bank report said</a>, with the brick industry making up over 90% of
particulate emissions in some South Asian cities and 15% of the most
dangerous small particulate emissions in Delhi.<del></del>
</p>
<p>
In a story that will be familiar to much of industrial and
post-industrial America, these industrial processes are both an
important economic engine and an obvious detriment to health locally and
are contributing to the climatic changes that are already having
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/06/india/extreme-heat-india-climate-ac-intl-hnk/index.html#:~:text=Rising%20heat&text=And%20the%20country's%20more%20tropical,Weather%20and%20Climate%20Extremes%20journal." target="_blank">devastating
effects in South Asia</a>. Efforts to regulate the brick industry have
already run into complaints that efficiency requirements will be
<a href="https://www.newslaundry.com/2024/01/16/indias-brick-kiln-workers-fear-loss-of-livelihood-to-green-alternatives" target="_blank">too
expensive for cash-strapped businesses</a> and will result in lower
employment in the sector.
</p>
<p>
In the vertiginous world of globalized capitalism, different regions
using the same resource — the Appalachian coal mines, the Baltimore
port, and the Indian brick manufacturers — can all at the same time be
at different stages of industrialization and post-industrialization,
with differing attitudes toward the coal that powers and pollutes them.
In South Baltimore, the people living with the dust from the coal pier
no longer sees any positive relationship between industrial activity and
their own well-being, Ahmann told me.
</p>
<p>
The Baltimore and Ohio railroad, which has been part of the rail
conglomerate CSX since 1980, began construction in 1827 and has long
shipped coal from West Virginia and other Appalachian states to the East
Coast. Baltimore’s Curtis Bay neighborhood, where Ahmann lived, is
adjacent to a coal pier operated by CSX. “It’s an iconic local scene,
right by a local playground, stone throw from several elementary schools
and homes,” Ahmann said, making the neighborhood both “heavily
industrialized and very much a lived-in place.”
</p>
<p>
While the Maryland government trumpets direct and indirect employment at
the port of around
<a href="https://mpa.maryland.gov/Pages/executive-director.aspx" target="_blank">15,000
people</a>, that’s about half the number that worked there in 1970.
</p>
<p>
“It’s no longer the case that industry is a major employer in South
Baltimore,” Ahmann said. “It’s not like it was 40 years ago, when
everybody knew somebody whose livelihood was attached to industrial
production in this place.” Instead, people in the area “cobble together
lives from low-wage service jobs,” she said. Overall, manufacturing
employment in Maryland has been roughly
<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MDMFG" target="_blank">cut
in half since 1990</a>.
</p>
<p>
In late 2021, a CSX coal facility in Curtis Bay exploded,
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/baltimore-councilwoman-to-seek-suspension-of-operations-at-csx-curtis-bay-coal-terminal/" target="_blank">damaging
nearby homes</a> and spreading tremors for miles. Following the blast, a
coalition of community groups and the Maryland Department of the
Environment investigated particulate pollution in Curtis Bay and found
coal dust “present throughout the community,” with coal dust coming from
the terminal itself, as well as train and truck traffic.
</p>
<p>
“We should not have open air coal piers period, and certainly not in a
residential area behind a playground,” Ahmann said.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>Among the many fears locals are nursing as the Key Bridge
lies in ruins is that the coal will simply pile up at the port as long
as it remains blocked. “These piles are going to grow every day,” Ahmann
told me, describing it as “stark visual evidence of the untenability of
this situation.”

<h2 id="pay-per-scroll">Pay per scroll</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;7.40 am. I’m sitting on a rock. Birds are chirping. Annoying rain coming down the gray sky. The rock I’m sitting on is wet. That’s also annoying. I’m sitting here, watching my dog walking up and down, destroying all the sticks that are lying on the ground. It’s a chilled morning.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Anyway, I’m sitting here, typing this on my phone. I have my phone with
me. I shouldn’t. I should have a book with me. But it’s raining. And
books don’t go along well with rain.
</p>
<p>
Books are interesting objects. The entire consumption process of a book
is interesting, especially when compared to websites. There’s no
equivalent of the web for books. There’s no place where an infinite
supply of books is available to you at virtually no cost. Reading a book
involves some decision-making and, more often than not, some financial
investment.
</p>
<p>
Sure, some of you are probably saying that libraries are the equivalent
of the web for books but that’s not the same thing. And don’t get me
wrong, libraries are great!
</p>
<p>
Reflecting on books made me think about what the web would look like if
it was some sort of pay-per-scroll platform. Not a place where virtually
everything is free but a place where everything has to be purchased in
order to be consumed. Which sites would I be willing to pay for? I’m
going to ignore the obvious answers because I’m sure almost everyone
would have sites like Wikipedia or YouTube. Those are boring answers.
Aggregators such as Hacker News or Reddit would also not be something
I’d be interested in paying for because the actual content lives
somewhere else. So I’d be paying just for the commentary.
</p>
<p>
In my case, I’d probably pay for two types of websites: either personal
sites of people that do things I enjoy or that have interesting takes on
the world or sites that collect content coming from a diverse group of
people (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com">LessWrong</a> is a good
example).
</p>
<p>
Would I be happy if the web was some sort of à la carte menu rather than
a free buffet? I’d say no. Still, thinking about this made me
realize—once again—that my media diet is something that I have to always
keep in mind. It also reminded me that I’m not reading enough books!

<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>On Wednesday, President Joe Biden issued an executive order
instructing the National Park Service to “highlight important figures
and chapters in women’s history.” “Women and girls of all backgrounds
have shaped our country’s history, from the ongoing fight for justice
and equality to cutting-edge scientific advancements and artistic
achievements,” the announcement read. “Yet these contributions have
often been overlooked. We must do more to recognize the role of women
and girls in America’s story, including through the Federal Government’s
recognition and interpretation of historic and cultural sites.”</p>

id="after-bridge-collapse-maryland-governor-urges-congress-to-pass-funding-for-rebuild">After
bridge collapse, Maryland governor urges Congress to pass funding for
rebuild</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — With efforts underway to clean up thousands of tons of
steel debris from the collapsed bridge in Baltimore’s harbor, Maryland
Governor Wes Moore on Sunday urged Republicans to work with Democrats to
approve the</p>
<p>federal funding needed for rebuilding the bridge and to get the port
economy back on its feet.</p>
<p>Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key bridge collapsed early on Tuesday
morning, killing six road workers, when a container ship nearly the size
of the Eiffel Tower lost power and crashed into a support pylon. Much of
the span crashed into the Patapsco River, blocking the Port of
Baltimore’s shipping channel.</p>
<p>The Biden administration released $60 million in initial emergency
aid on Thursday to assist in cleaning up the bridge debris and reopening
the port, which is the largest in the U.S. for “roll-on, roll-off”
vehicle imports and exports of farm and construction equipment. The port
has been closed since Tuesday, leaving in limbo the jobs of some 15,000
people who rely on its daily operations.</p>
<p>Federal officials have told Maryland lawmakers the final cost of
rebuilding the bridge could soar to at least $2 billion, Roll Call
reported, citing a source familiar with the</p>
<p>Discussions.</p>
<p>Democratic President Joe Biden has pledged that the federal
government will cover the cost, but that will depend on passage of
legislation authorizing the funds by both the Republican-led House of
Representatives and Democratic-led Senate. The divided</p>
<p>Congress has been repeatedly riven by partisan battles over funding,
with hardline Republicans often at odds even with members of their own
party.</p>
<p>Moore, a Democrat, said Republicans should be willing to approve the
funding for the sake of not just the city of Baltimore, but for the
national economy.</p>
<p>“The reason that we need people to move in a bipartisan basis … is
not because we need you to do Maryland a favor,” Moore told CNN on
Sunday. “We need to make sure that we’re actually moving quickly to get
the American economy going again, because the Port of Baltimore is
instrumental in our larger economic growth.”</p>
<p>Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg expressed optimism on
Sunday that Congress would approve the funds necessary for the cleanup
and rebuild, noting that the divided legislative body had passed Biden’s
$1 trillion infrastructure package in 2021.</p>
<p>“If there’s anything left in this country that is more bipartisan
than infrastructure, it should be emergency response.</p>
<p>This is both, and I hope that Congress will be willing if and when we
turn to them,” Buttigieg told CBS’s “Face the Nation.”</p>
<p>Biden was expected to visit the bridge collapse site this week.</p>
<p>An enormous crane began cutting up portions of the collapsed bridge
to prepare them for removal on Saturday, which officials said was the
first step of what will be a long and complicated cleanup. A
spokesperson for the governor’s office said on Sunday that a 180-metric
ton (200-ton) piece of the bridge had been removed and officials were
working to determine the best strategy for pulling the ship off the
wreckage.</p>
<p>Later Sunday officials said they were preparing to establish an
alternate route for “commercially essential vessels,” although few
additional details were released and the timing of the alternate route’s
opening wasn’t made clear.</p>
<p>In a statement, coordinator Capt. David O’Connell said that the
alternate would “support the flow of marine traffic into Baltimore.”
Video released by responders showed Coast Guard officials dropping buoys
into the water near the site of the collision.</p>
<p>The wreckage and hazardous weather conditions have made it impossible
for divers to continue searching for the four remaining bodies of the
deceased construction workers in recent days, Moore said.</p>
<p>Moore and other officials have declined to give an estimated timeline
for the reopening of the port and the rebuilding of the bridge.</p>

recalls 427,000 Telluride SUVs, could roll away while parked</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Kia is recalling more than 427,000 of its Telluride SUVs
due to a defect that may cause the cars to roll away while they’re
parked.</p>
<p>According to documents published by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, the intermediate shaft and right front driveshaft
of certain 2020-2024 Tellurides may not be fully engaged. Over time,
this can lead to “unintended vehicle movement” while the cars are in
park — increasing potential crash risks.</p>
<p>Kia America decided to recall all 2020-2023 model year and select
2024 model year Tellurides earlier this month, NHTSA documents show. At
the time, no injuries or crashes were reported.</p>
<p>Improper assembly is suspected to be the cause of the shaft
engagement problem — with the recall covering 2020-2024 Tellurides that
were manufactured between Jan. 9, 2019, and Oct. 19, 2023. Kia America
estimates that 1% have the defect.</p>
<p>To remedy this issue, recall documents say, dealers will update the
affected cars’ electronic parking brake software and replace any damaged
intermediate shafts for free. Owners who already incurred repair
expenses will also be reimbursed.</p>
<p>In the meantime, drivers of the impacted Tellurides are instructed to
manually engage the emergency brake before exiting the vehicle. Drivers
can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall
and find more information using the NHTSA site and/or Kia’s recall
lookup platform.</p>
<p>Owner notification letters are otherwise set to be mailed out on May
15, with dealer notification beginning a few days prior.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reached out to Irvine, California-based Kia
America for further comment Sunday. No comment was received.</p>

<h2 id="gmail-revolutionized-email-20-years-ago">Gmail revolutionized
email 20 years ago</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>San Francisco — Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin loved
pulling pranks, so they began rolling out outlandish ideas every April
Fool’s Day not long after starting their company more than a quarter
century ago. One year, Google posted a job opening for a Copernicus
research center on the moon. Another year, the company said it planned
to roll out a “scratch and sniff” feature on its search engine.</p>
<p>The jokes were consistently over-the-top, and people learned to laugh
them off as another example of Google mischief. That’s why Page and Brin
decided to unveil something no one would believe was possible 20 years
ago on April Fool’s Day.</p>
<p>It was Gmail, a free service boasting 1 gigabyte of storage per
account, an amount that sounds almost pedestrian in an age of 1-terabyte
iPhones. But it sounded like a preposterous amount of email capacity
back then, enough to store about 13,500 emails before running out of
space compared to just 30 to 60 emails in the then-leading webmail
services run by Yahoo and Microsoft. That translated into 250 to 500
times more email storage space.</p>
<p>Besides the quantum leap in storage, Gmail also came equipped with
Google’s search technology so users could quickly retrieve a tidbit from
an old email, photo or other personal information stored on the service.
It also automatically threaded together a string of communications about
the same topic, so everything flowed together as if it was a single
conversation.</p>
<p>“The original pitch we put together was all about the three ‘S’s’ —
storage, search and speed,” said former Google executive Marissa Mayer,
who helped design Gmail and other company products before later becoming
Yahoo’s CEO.</p>
<p>It was such a mind-bending concept that shortly after The Associated
Press published a story about Gmail late on the afternoon of April
Fool’s 2004, readers began calling and emailing to inform the news
agency it had been duped by Google’s pranksters.</p>
<p>“That was part of the charm, making a product that people won’t
believe is real. It kind of changed people’s perceptions about the kinds
of applications that were possible within a web browser,” former Google
engineer Paul Buchheit recalled during a recent AP interview about his
efforts to build Gmail.</p>
<p>It took three years to do as part of a project called “Caribou” — a
reference to a running gag in the Dilbert comic strip. “There was
something sort of absurd about the name Caribou, it just made make me
laugh,” said Buchheit, the 23rd employee hired at a company that now
employs more than 180,000 people.</p>
<p>The AP knew Google wasn’t joking about Gmail because an AP reporter
had been abruptly asked to come down from San Francisco to the company’s
Mountain View, California, headquarters to see something that would make
the trip worthwhile.</p>
<p>After arriving at a still-developing corporate campus that would soon
blossom into what became known as the “Googleplex,” the AP reporter was
ushered into a small office where Page was wearing an impish grin while
sitting in front of his laptop computer.</p>
<p>Page, then just 31 years old, proceeded to show off Gmail’s sleekly
designed inbox and demonstrated how quickly it operated within
Microsoft’s now-retired Explorer web browser. And he pointed out there
was no delete button featured in the main control window because it
wouldn’t be necessary, given Gmail had so much storage and could be so
easily searched. “I think people are really going to like this,” Page
predicted.</p>
<p>As with so many other things, Page was right. Gmail now has an
estimated 1.8 billion active accounts — each one now offering 15
gigabytes of free storage bundled with Google Photos and Google Drive.
Even though that’s 15 times more storage than Gmail initially offered,
it’s still not enough for many users who rarely see the need to purge
their accounts, just as Google hoped.</p>
<p>The digital hoarding of email, photos and other content is why
Google, Apple and other companies now make money from selling additional
storage capacity in their data centers. (In Google’s case, it charges
anywhere from $30 annually for 200 gigabytes of storage to $250 annually
for 5 terabytes of storage). Gmail’s existence is also why other free
email services and the internal email accounts that employees use on
their jobs offer far more storage than was fathomed 20 years ago.</p>
<p>“We were trying to shift the way people had been thinking because
people were working in this model of storage scarcity for so long that
deleting became a default action,” Buchheit said.</p>
<p>Gmail was a game changer in several other ways while becoming the
first building block in the expansion of Google’s internet empire beyond
its still-dominant search engine.</p>
<p>After Gmail came Google Maps and Google Docs with word processing and
spreadsheet applications. Then came the acquisition of video site
YouTube, followed by the introduction of the Chrome browser and the
Android operating system that powers most of the world’s smartphones.
With Gmail’s explicitly stated intention to scan the content of emails
to get a better understanding of users’ interests, Google also left
little doubt that digital surveillance in pursuit of selling more ads
would be part of its expanding ambitions.</p>
<p>Although it immediately generated a buzz, Gmail started out with a
limited scope because Google initially only had enough computing
capacity to support a small audience of users.</p>
<p>But that scarcity created an air of exclusivity around Gmail that
drove feverish demand for elusive invitations to sign up. At one point,
invitations to open a Gmail account were selling for $250 apiece on
eBay. “It became a bit like a social currency, where people would go,
‘Hey, I got a Gmail invite, you want one?’” Buchheit said.</p>
<p>Although signing up for Gmail became increasingly easier as more of
Google’s network of massive data centers came online, the company didn’t
begin accepting all comers to the email service until it opened the
floodgates as a Valentine’s Day present to the world in 2007.</p>

<h2 id="godzilla-x-kong-roars-to-80-million-box-office-debut">‘Godzilla
x Kong’ roars to $80 million box office debut</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — The Godzilla-King Kong combo stomped on expectations as
“Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire” roared to an $80 million opening on
3,861 North American screens, according to Sunday studio estimates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The monster mash-up from Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures starring
Rebecca Hall and Brian Tyree Henry brought the second-highest opening in
what has been a robust year, falling just short of the $81.5 million
debut of “Dune: Part 2.”  Projections had put the opening weekend of
“Godzilla x Kong: Frozen Empire” at closer to $50 million.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Last week’s No. 1 at the box office, “Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire,”
was second with $15.7 million for a two-week total of $73.4 million.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Dune: Part Two” stayed strong in its fifth week, falling in the
third spot with an $11.1 million take and a domestic total of $252.4
million.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The last matchup of the two monsters from Warner Bros. and Legendary,
2021’s “Godzilla vs. Kong,” had a much smaller opening weekend of $48.5
million, but that was a huge number for a film slowed by the coronavirus
pandemic and released simultaneously on HBO Max.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The newer film had the second biggest opening of the studios’ broader
MonsterVerse franchise. “Godzilla” brought in $93.2 million in 2014.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales are for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and
Canadian theaters,  </p>
<p>according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

<h2 id="baltimore-bridge-being-cut-up-after-ship-collision">Baltimore
bridge being cut up after ship collision</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Baltimore, Maryland — The crumpled Baltimore bridge was being cut up
in preparation for its removal, Maryland’s governor said Sunday,
promising “progress” was being made after it was destroyed by an
out-of-control ship.</p>
<p>Demolition crews using blow torches sliced through the top part of
the Francis Scott Key Bridge, which collapsed when the Dali cargo vessel
lost power and struck it on Tuesday, killing six people.</p>
<p>“Progress is beginning to happen despite the fact that it’s an
incredibly complicated situation,” said Maryland Governor Wes Moore,
adding that weather conditions and debris in the water meant divers were
unable to assist with the recovery operation.</p>
<p>“We now do have cranes, the Chesapeake 1,000, which has a capacity of
lifting a thousand pounds,” Moore told CNN on Sunday.</p>
<p>“[Workers have] begun to cut up the remnants of the bridge that we
can then prepare for removal.”</p>
<p>Video footage shared Saturday by the Unified Command — the overall
response team that includes the U.S. Coast Guard — showed sparks flying
as crews suspended in cages cut through an upper section of the steel
structure.</p>
<p>The Unified Command said the wreckage will lifted away and processed
at a Baltimore shipping site before being taken to a disposal site.</p>
<p>Moore said the recovery would be a “long road,” adding: “This is a
very complex operation, but movement is happening.”</p>
<p>The difficult conditions have hampered efforts to recover the bodies
of the six road workers — all Latino immigrants — who died when the
bridge collapsed, with just two bodies recovered so far.</p>
<p>Shipping in and out of Baltimore — one of the United States’ busiest
ports — has been halted, with the waterway impassable due to the
sprawling wreckage.</p>
<p>Moore told MSNBC on Sunday that his priorities were recovering the
victims’ bodies before reopening the channel.</p>
<p>“It’s impacting the nation’s economy. It’s the largest port for new
cars, heavy trucks, agricultural equipment. It’s impacting people all
over the country,” he said.</p>
<p>The ship veered towards the bridge due to power trouble, with the
pilot issuing a Mayday call that allowed some road traffic to be stopped
just before the collision at 1:30am after which the structure collapsed
in seconds.</p>
<p>“It takes a lot to make sure that it can be dismantled safely, to
make sure that the vessel stays where it is supposed to be and doesn’t
swing out into the channel,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg
told “Face the Nation” on CBS.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-is-about-more-than-just-code">Open source is about
more than just code</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>As some of the dust around the xz backdoor is slowly starting to
settle, we’ve been getting a pretty clear picture of what, exactly,
happened, and it’s not pretty. This is a story of the sole maintainer of
a crucial building block of the open source stack having mental health
issues, which at least partly contributes to a lack of interest in
maintaining xz. It seems a coordinated campaign – consensus seems to
point to a state actor – is then started to infiltrate xz, with the goal
of inserting a backdoor into the project. Evan Boehs has done the
legwork of diving into the mailing lists and commit logs of various
projects and the people involved, and it almost reads like the nerd
version of a spy novel. It involves seemingly fake users and accounts
violently pressuring the original xz maintainer to add a second
maintainer; a second maintainer who mysteriously seems to appear at
around the same time, like a saviour. This second maintainer manages to
gain the original maintainer’s trust, and within months, this mysterious
newcomer more or less takes over as the new maintainer. As the new
maintainer, this person starts adding the malicious code in question.
Sockpuppet accounts show up to add code to oss-fuzz to try and make sure
the backdoor won’t be detected. Once all the code is in place for the
backdoor to function, more fake accounts show up to push for the
compromised versions of xz to be included in Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu,
and possibly others. Roughly at this point, the backdoor is discovered
entirely by chance because Andres Freund noticed his SSH logins felt a
fraction of a second slower, and he wanted to know why. What seems to
have happened here is a bad actor – again, most likely a state actor –
finding and targeting a vulnerable maintainer, who, through clever
social engineering on both a personal level as well as the project
level, gained control over a crucial but unexciting building block of
the open source stack. Once enough control and trust was gained, the bad
actor added a backdoor to do… Well, something. It seems nobody really
knows yet what the ultimate goal was, but we can all make some educated
guesses and none of them are any good. When we think of vulnerabilities
in computer software, we tend to focus on bugs and mistakes that
unintentionally create the conditions wherein someone with malicious
intent can do, well, malicious things. We don’t often consider the
possibility of maintainers being malicious, secretly adding backdoors
for all kinds of nefarious purposes. The problem the xz backdoor
highlights is that while we have quite a few ways to prevent, discover,
mitigate, and fix unintentional security holes, we seem to have pretty
much nothing in place to prevent intentional backdoors placed by trusted
maintainers. And this is a real problem. There are so many utterly
crucial but deeply boring building blocks all over the open source
stacks pretty much the entire computing world makes use of that it has
become a meme, spearheaded by xkcd’s classic comic. The weakness in many
of these types of projects is not the code, but the people maintaining
that code, most likely through no fault of their own. There are so many
things life can throw at you that would make you susceptible to social
engineering – money problems, health problems, mental health issues,
burnout, relationship problems, god knows what else – and the open
source community has nothing in place to help maintainers of obscure but
crucial pieces of infrastructure deal with problems like these. That’s
why I’m suggesting the idea of setting up a foundation – or whatever
legal entity makes sense – that is dedicated to helping maintainers who
face the kinds of problems like the maintainer of xz did. A place where
a maintainer who is dealing with problems outside of the code repository
can go to for help, advice, maybe even financial and health assistance
if needed. Even if all this foundation offers to someone is a person to
talk to in confidence, it might mean the difference between burning out
completely, or recovering at least enough to then possibly find other
ways to improve one’s situation. If someone is burnt-out or has a mental
health crisis, they could contact the foundation, tell their story, and
say, hey, I need a few months to recover and deal with my problems, can
we put out a call among already trusted members of the open source
community to step in for me for a while? Keep the ship steady as she
goes without rocking it until I get back or we find someone to take over
permanently? This way, the wider community will also know the regular,
trusted maintainer is stepping down for a while, and that any new
commits should be treated with extra care, solving the problem of some
unknown maintainer of an obscure but important package suffering in
obscurity, the only hints found in the low-volume mailing list well
after something goes wrong. The financial responsibility for such a
safety net should undoubtedly be borne by the long list of ultra-rich
megacorporations who profit off the backs of these people toiling away
in obscurity. The financial burden for something like this would be
pocket change to the likes of Google, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, and so on,
but could make a contribution to open source far greater than any code
dump. Governments could probably be involved too, but that will most
likely open up a whole can of worms, so I’m not sure if that would be a
good idea. I’m not proposing this be some sort of glorified ATM where
people can go to get some free money whenever they feel like it. The
goal should be to help people who form crucial cogs in the delicate
machinery of computing to live healthy, sustainable lives so their code
and contributions to the community don’t get compromised. This</p>

significant performance and correctness improvements to the kernel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>This year, there have been numerous improvements both to the kernel’s
correctness, as well as raw performance. The signal and TLB shootdown
MRs have significantly improved kernel memory integrity and possibly
eliminated many hard-to-debug and nontrivial heisenbugs. Nevertheless,
there is still a lot of work to be done optimizing and fixing bugs in
relibc, in order to improve compatibility with ported applications, and
most importantly of all, getting closer to a self-hosted Redox. ↫ Jacob
Lorentzon (4lDO2) I love how much of the focus for Redox seems to be on
the lower levels of the operating system, because it’s something many
projects tend to kind of forget to highlight, to spend more time on new
icons or whatever. These in-depth Redox articles are always informative,
and have me very excited about Redox’ future. Obviously, Redox is on the
list of operating systems I need to write a proper article about. I’m
not sure if there’s enough for a full review or if it’ll be more of a
short look – we’ll see when we get there.</p>

<p>In October 2023, we published a recap of the top 10 features Windows
11 users want for the redesigned Start menu. Number 6 was the ability to
switch from list view to grid view in the “All Apps” list, which
received over 1,500 upvotes in the Feedback Hub. Six months later,
Microsoft finally appears to be ready to give users what they want.
PhantomOfEarth, the ever-giving source of hidden stuff in Windows 11
preview builds, discovered that Windows 11 build 22635.3420 lets you
change from list to grid view in the “All Apps” section. Like other
unannounced features, this one requires a bit of tinkering using the
ViVeTool app until Microsoft makes it official. ↫ Taras Buria I’m still
baffled Microsoft consistently manages to mess up something as
once-iconic and impactful like the Start menu. It seems like Microsoft
just can’t leave it well enough alone, even though it kind of already
nailed it in Windows 95 – just give us that, but with a modern search
function, and we’re all going to be happy. That’s it. We don’t want or
need more.</p>

id="new-20-minimum-wage-for-california-fast-food-workers-starts-monday">New
$20 minimum wage for California fast food workers starts Monday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LIVERMORE, Calif. — Most fast food workers in California will be paid
at least $20 an hour beginning Monday when a new law is scheduled to
kick in giving more financial security to an historically low-paying
profession while threatening to raise prices in a state already known
for its high cost of living.</p>
<p>Democrats in the state Legislature passed the law last year in part
as an acknowledgement that many of the more than 500,000 people who work
in fast food restaurants are not teenagers earning some spending money,
but adults working to support their families.</p>
<p>That includes immigrants like Ingrid Vilorio, who said she started
working at a McDonald’s shortly after arriving in the United States in
2019. Fast food was her full-time job until last year. Now, she works
about eight hours per week at a Jack in the Box while working other
jobs.</p>
<p>“The $20 raise is great. I wish this would have come sooner,” Vilorio
said through a translator. “Because I would not have been looking for so
many other jobs in different places.”</p>
<p>The law was supported by the trade association representing fast food
franchise owners. But since it passed, many franchise owners have
bemoaned the impact the law is having on them, especially during
California’s slowing economy.</p>
<p>Alex Johnson owns 10 Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and Cinnabon restaurants
in the San Francisco Bay Area. He said sales have slowed in 2024,
prompting him to lay off his office staff and rely on his parents to
help with payroll and human resources.</p>
<p>Increasing his employees’ wages will cost Johnson about $470,000 each
year. He will have to raise prices anywhere from 5% to 15% at his
stores, and is no longer hiring or seeking to open new locations in
California, he said.</p>
<p>“I try to do right by my employees. I pay them as much as I can. But
this law is really hitting our operations hard,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>“I have to consider selling and even closing my business,” he said.
“The profit margin has become too slim when you factor in all the other
expenses that are also going up.”</p>
<p>Over the past decade, California has doubled its minimum wage for
most workers to $16 per hour. A big concern over that time was whether
the increase would cause some workers to lose their jobs as employers’
expenses increased.</p>
<p>Instead, data showed wages went up and employment did not fall, said
Michael Reich, a labor economics professor at the University of
California-Berkeley.</p>
<p>“I was surprised at how little, or how difficult it was to find
disemployment effects. If anything, we find positive employment
effects,” Reich said.</p>
<p>Plus, Reich said while the statewide minimum wage is $16 per hour,
many of the state’s larger cities have their own minimum wage laws
setting the rate higher than that. For many fast food restaurants, this
means the jump to $20 per hour will be smaller.</p>
<p>The law reflected a carefully crafted compromise between the fast
food industry and labor unions, which had been fighting over wages,
benefits and legal liabilities for close to two years. The law
originated during private negotiations between unions and the industry,
including the unusual step of signing confidentiality agreements.</p>
<p>The law applies to restaurants offering limited or no table service
and which are part of a national chain with at least 60 establishments
nationwide. Restaurants operating inside a grocery establishment are
exempt, as are restaurants producing and selling bread as a stand-alone
menu item.</p>
<p>At first, it appeared the bread exemption applied to Panera Bread
restaurants. Bloomberg News reported the change would benefit Greg
Flynn, a wealthy campaign donor to Newsom. But the Newsom administration
said the wage increase law does apply to Panera Bread because the
restaurant does not make dough on-site. Also, Flynn has announced he
would pay his workers at least $20 per hour.</p>

<p>
If you’ve followed my writing or videos, you’ll know I’m a “life on
two-wheels” kind of guy. If there’s an electric motorcycle, e-bike,
scooter, or anything else remotely rideable out there,
<a href="https://electrek.co/2022/11/28/ive-ridden-every-electric-motorcycle/">I’ve
probably thrown a leg over it at least once</a>. Over the years I’ve
been fortunate enough to learn how each type of vehicle comes with its
own unique personality and enjoyment, but also its own risk profile. And
without the benefit of 5,000 pounds of murderous steel around us, out of
necessity we motorcycle riders become masters of balancing risk.
</p>
<p>
But could the perceived risk of different types of rides, such as
e-motorcycles versus e-bikes, cloud our judgment on personal protection?
I think it might, at least for me. And so I’ve been on a hunt for the
right gear to fix that.

<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The other day I was asked why I have a blog, why I write. Hard questions to answer. I don’t really know why I’m doing all this. I know why I started back in 2017. But the reason why I started is long gone at this point. I started the blog as some sort of public accountability tool and it’s now everything but that. I don’t write to be accountable. I probably should.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
The more I write on this site, the more I realize that what I’m trying
to do is to connect. I’m trying to connect with others—with you—but I’m
also trying to help others connect with each other. And, in a weird way,
I’m also trying to connect with myself.
</p>
<p>
It’s why I find it so enjoyable to share other people’s projects on this
site. It’s why I’m happy to remind you that March is almost over and if
you haven’t already you should write something for this month’s
<a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">IndieWeb
Carnival</a>. It’s also why I’m finding most of the current web so
annoying and distasteful. The endless self-promotion, the attempt to
grow a persona, the lack of authenticity. Everything becomes
transactional and something is lost in the process.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
I’m a nobody. I’m just a random person with a website like countless
others out there. There’s nothing special about what I’m doing here and
that’s how it should be. Sharing what we find interesting shouldn’t be
some special activity. Being kind to one another should be the norm.
We’re social creatures. Connecting with others is a great way to grow
and improve as human beings. This is probably why I’m writing. To become
a better me.

2024-03-27 Convert text file to PDF
</h1>
<p>
I just couldn’t find a good way to turn a text file into a PDF. Within
Emacs, <code>ps-print-buffer</code> is hard to configure and my two
specific problems were the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
everything is turned into Latin-1 so I cannot use the EN dash;
</li>
<li>
the line length was set too short so that I couldn’t print lines longer
than 80 characters even though there was plenty of space left.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I wasted some time trying to write something in Bash, turned to Perl and
wasted some more time trying to figure out why the encodings were all
wrong except when the encodings were OK but Perl gave me a warning for
every multi-byte character. So frustrating.
</p>
<p>
The solution ended up not being decoding and encoding the bytes in the
Perl script but to use the <code>–encoding</code> option for
<code>weasyprint</code>. In this case, it wasn’t Perl’s fault, it was my
fear of Perl’s encoding issues that led my down endless variations of
<code>binmode</code>, <code>:utf8</code>, <code>decode_utf8</code> and
<code>encode_utf8</code>. But I think I have it, now.
</p>
<p>
This is what I ended up with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
use <code>weasyprint</code>;
</li>
<li>
wrap it all in a <code>pre</code> tag.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I created a script called <code>to-pdf</code> with the following:
</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use Modern::Perl;
use File::Basename;

if (@ARGV == 0) {
  die &quot;Usage: to-pdf file.txt ...\n&quot;;
}

for (@ARGV) {
  open(my $text, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $_) or die &quot;Cannot read $_\n&quot;;
  my ($name, $path, $suffix) = fileparse($_, &quot;.txt&quot;);
  open(my $html, &quot;|-&quot;) || exec &quot;weasyprint&quot;, &quot;--encoding&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;$path$name.pdf&quot;;

  print $html &lt;&lt;'BEG';
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family: Iosevka; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;
BEG

  for (&lt;$text&gt;) { print $html $_ }; # copy text

  print $html &lt;&lt;'END';
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
END
}
</code></pre>

portrait of Mao goes missing, college seeks return, ‘no questions
asked’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington/Los Angeles — A California college is seeking the return,
“no questions asked,” of an iconic image of Chinese Communist Party
founder Mao Zedong created by famed American artist Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Orange Coast College discovered that one of Warhol’s
signed silkscreen prints of Mao was missing from its vault. The portrait
has an estimated value of $50,000.</p>
<p>Doug Bennett, executive director for college advancement at Orange
Coast College, told VOA’s Mandarin Service that the print was purchased
by a person close to the school from a gallery in Laguna Beach,
California, in 1974 and donated to the school anonymously in September
2020.</p>
<p>But now, even before it was put on display, it’s gone missing.</p>
<p>Bennett said he hopes someone just took the print by mistake, adding
that the college wouldn’t ask questions if it was returned.</p>
<p>“Someone perhaps took it and put it in their office or put it in
their home and thought it was OK to do. Or maybe it was misplaced, but I
don’t think it was like a ring of art thieves that stole it,” he
said.</p>
<p>Warhol made the portraits of Mao in the 1970s after U.S. President
Richard Nixon’s historic visit to China.</p>
<p>“When it [the portrait of Mao] first came out in the 1970s, it was
very controversial, still maybe to some people,” Bennett said.</p>
<p>From 1972-73, Warhol used the image of Mao from the Little Red Book,
widely circulated in China, as a template to create 199 richly colored
Mao silkscreen works in five series.</p>
<p>The school immediately launched an internal investigation after
discovering the print was missing on March 13. A week later, a report
was made to the Costa Mesa Police Department in Orange County, where the
school is located. The police are investigating.</p>
<p>“It’s a high priority for the police department, and two detectives
are assigned to the case and are working on it,” Bennett said.</p>
<p>The Costa Mesa Police Department told VOA the investigation is
ongoing but did not provide any new details.</p>
<p>Police and the school are appealing for anyone with information to
come forward.</p>
<p>Warhol, who is known as the godfather of the pop art movement, began
using ubiquitous objects such as Campbell’s soup cans and Coca-Cola
bottles as subjects for his creations in the 1960s, kicking off the
movement.</p>
<p>A summary of the Mao portraits by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York says this about the series: “As interpreted by Warhol, these
works, with their repeated image painted in flamboyant colors and with
expressionistic marks, may suggest a parallel between political
propaganda and capitalist advertising.”</p>
<p>In 1982, Warhol visited China and took a photo in front of the
portrait of Mao in Tiananmen Square. Five years later, Warhol died.</p>
<p>In 2013, Warhol’s works toured China, but the Mao series was forced
to be withdrawn. At the time, Chinese state media claimed that the Mao
in the works “far exceeded the officially acceptable image.”</p>
<p>However, the Mao series has become one of Warhol’s most sought-after
celebrity portraits by collectors. According to data from Sotheby’s
auction house, in 2015, a Mao painting was sold for $47.5 million. In
2017, another painting of Mao was sold for $12.7 million.</p>

id="venezuelans-increasingly-stuck-in-mexico-lowering-illegal-crossings-to-us">Venezuelans
increasingly stuck in Mexico, lowering illegal crossings to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — Venezuelan migrants often have a quick answer when
asked to name the most difficult stretch of their eight-country journey
to the U.S. border, and it’s not the dayslong jungle trek through
Colombia and Panama with its venomous vipers, giant spiders and
scorpions. It’s Mexico.</p>
<p>“In the jungle, you have to prepare for animals. In Mexico, you have
to prepare for humans,” Daniel Ventura, 37, said after three days
walking through the Darien Gap and four months waiting in Mexico to
enter the U.S. legally using the government’s online appointment system,
called CBP One. He and his family of six were headed to Fort Atkinson,
Wisconsin, where he has a relative.</p>
<p>Mexico’s crackdown on immigration in recent months — at the urging of
the Biden administration — has hit Venezuelans especially hard. The
development highlights how much the U.S. depends on Mexico to control
migration, which has reached unprecedented levels and is a top issue for
voters as President Joe Biden seeks reelection.</p>
<p>Arrests of migrants for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border
have dropped so this year after a record high in December. The biggest
decline was among Venezuelans, whose arrests plummeted to 3,184 in
February and 4,422 in January from 49,717 in December.</p>
<p>While two months do not make a trend and illegal crossings remain
high by historical standards, Mexico’s strategy to keep migrants closer
to its border with Guatemala than the U.S. is at least temporary relief
for the Biden administration.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Venezuelans began reaching the U.S. in 2021, first
by flying to Mexico and then on foot and by bus after Mexico imposed
visa restrictions. In September, Venezuelans briefly replaced Mexicans
as the largest nationality crossing the border.</p>
<p>Mexico’s efforts have included forcing migrants from trains, flying
and busing them to the southern part of the country, and flying some
home to Venezuela.</p>
<p>Last week, Mexico said it would give about $110 a month for six
months to each Venezuelan it deports, hoping they won’t come back.
Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador extended the offer Tuesday
to Ecuadorians and Colombians.</p>
<p>“If you support people in their places of origin, the migratory flow
reduces considerably, but that requires resources and that is what the
United States government has not wanted to do,” said López Obrador, who
is barred by term limits from running in June elections.</p>
<p>Migrants say they must pay corrupt officials at Mexico’s frequent
government checkpoints to avoid being sent back to southern cities. Each
setback is costly and frustrating.</p>
<p>“In the end, it is a business because wherever you get to, they want
to take the last of what you have,” said Yessica Gutierrez, 30, who left
Venezuela in January in a group of 15 family members that includes young
children. They avoided some checkpoints by hiking through brush.</p>
<p>The group is now waiting in Mexico City to get an appointment so they
can legally cross the U.S.-Mexico border. To use the CBP One app,
applicants must be in central or northern Mexico. So Gutierrez’s group
sleeps in two donated tents across the street from a migrant shelter and
check the app daily.</p>
<p>More than 500,000 migrants have used the app to enter the U.S. at
land crossings with Mexico since its introduction in January 2023. They
can stay in the U.S. for two years under a presidential authority called
parole, which entitles them to work.</p>
<p>“I would rather cross the jungle 10 times than pass through Mexico
once,” said Jose Alberto Uzcategui, who left a construction job in the
Venezuelan city of Trujillo with his wife and sons, ages 5 and 7, in a
family group of 11. They are biding time in Mexico City until they have
enough money for a phone so they can use CBP One.</p>
<p>Venezuelans account for the vast majority of 73,166 migrants who
crossed the Darien Gap in January and February, which is on pace to pass
last year’s record of more than 500,000, according to the Panamanian
government, suggesting Venezuelans are still fleeing a country that has
lost more than 7 million people amid political turmoil and economic
decline. Mexican authorities stopped Venezuelan migrants more than
56,000 times in February, about twice as much as the previous two
months, according to government figures.</p>
<p>“The underlying question here is: Where are the Venezuelans? They’re
in Mexico, but where are they?” said Stephanie Brewer, who covers Mexico
for the Washington Office on Latin America, a group that monitors human
rights abuses.</p>
<p>Mexico deported only about 429 Venezuelans during the first two
months of 2024, meaning nearly all are waiting in Mexico.</p>
<p>Many fear that venturing north of Mexico City will get them fleeced
or returned to southern Mexico. The U.S. admits 1,450 people a day
through CBP One with appointments that are granted two weeks out.</p>
<p>Even if they evade Mexican authorities, migrants feel threatened by
gangs who kidnap, extort and commit other violent crimes.</p>
<p>“You have to go town by town because the cartels need to put food on
their plates,” said Maria Victoria Colmenares, 27, who waited seven
months in Mexico City for a CBP One appointment, supporting her family
by working as a waitress while her husband worked at a car wash.</p>
<p>“It’s worth the wait because it brings a reward,” said Colmenares,
who took a taxi from the Tijuana airport to the border crossing with San
Diego, hours before her Tuesday appointment.</p>
<p>Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has touted his own efforts to
explain the recent reduction in illegal crossings in his state, where at
least 95% of Border Patrol arrests of Venezuelans occur. Those have
included installing razor wire, putting a floating barrier in the Rio
Grande and making plans to build a new base for members of the National
Guard.</p>
<p>U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has mostly
credited Mexico for the drop in border arrests.</p>
<p>Some Venezuelans still come north despite the perils. </p>
<p>Marbelis Torrealba, 35, arrived in Matamoros, across the border from
Brownsville, Texas, with her sister and niece this week, carrying ashes
of her daughter who drowned in a boat that capsized in Nicaragua. She
said they were robbed by Mexican officials and gangs and returned
several times to southern Mexico.</p>
<p>A shelter arranged for them to enter the U.S. legally on emergency
humanitarian grounds, but she was prepared to cross illegally.</p>
<p>“I already experienced the worst: Seeing your child die in front of
you and not being able to do anything.”</p>

weekend: Data General/One (and the worst LCD in the world)</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: Old Vintage Computer Research</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that while I prefer specializing in non-x86
laptops, that doesn’t mean I don’t collect interesting or unusual x86
laptops, like the
<a href="/2023/06/o-brother-geobook-lets-get-thou-back-on.html">Brother
GeoBook NB-60</a> (I finally tracked down a mostly working NB-80C, the
top of the line model, which will be the subject of
<a href="/search/label/refurb%20weekend">a future restoration</a>).
However, this one is a unit I’ve had since about 1998 when they were
getting rid of it at the University I worked for, and in many ways a
landmark PC laptop since it was the first battery-capable system with a
full 80x25 or CGA 640x200 LCD — though with a notorious deficiency: more
on that shortly — and also came with a terminal and text editor in ROM.
This is the 1984 Data General/One.</p>

I suspect it was primarily used to dial into the campus network using
the built-in modem and ROM terminal emulator, at least until better
alternatives became available, and then ended up forgotten somewhere
until they were cleaning things out and asked me if I wanted it. (Yes, I
was retro even before retro.) It came with its bag, power supply and
modem cable, and <em>of course</em> I said yes. It wasn’t pristine,
though: the floppy disk eject buttons wouldn’t stay on anymore, it
couldn’t remember its hardware configuration, and the main drive had
issues with nearly full disks. And then there was that infamous LCD.
<p>
<p>Ah, what the heck. I finally got a round tuit. That makes it time for

Early luggables, of course, existed well before the DG-1, such as the
CP/M-based Kaypros and Osbornes. After the emergence of the 5150 IBM PC
and XT, the Compaq Portable shocked the market in 1982 with its legally
unassailable clean-room BIOS that induced IBM to produce the 5155 IBM
Portable in 1984. (Naturally my favourite luggable of that era would
have to be
<a href="/2020/12/unboxing-best-gift-of-1983-commodore-sx.html">the
Commodore SX-64</a>, the first colour portable.) All these systems used
small CRTs for screens, so there was no realistic way to run them off a
battery smaller than the one in your car. Though the 1982
<a href="http://www.oldcomputers.net/grid1101.html">GRiD Compass
1101</a> had a full-sized flat electroluminescent display (ELD), ELDs
were nearly as power-hungry, and thus the machine could not run
untethered either.
<p>
Instead, the 1983
<a href="http://www.oldcomputers.net/gavilan.html">Gavilan SC</a> is
usually regarded as the first true DOS PC laptop. Its 66x8 (400x64) LCD
was detailed enough to support a rudimentary GUI using its touch pad as
well as MS-DOS 2.11, it came with an internal 3.5” floppy (the GRiD did
not), and the LCD and battery-backed RAM storage were light enough to
finally run the entire system on batteries. Still, it was quite
expensive and its small display size limited its utility, a problem not
fully addressed by the 1983
<a href="http://www.oldcomputers.net/commuter.html">Visual Commuter</a>,
which had a full 80 column LCD but in its first iteration only 16 lines
of text. Both machines, catering to the traveling professional, included
300 baud modems and ROM-based terminal software.
<p>
<p>Meanwhile, the era of the personal computer generally spelled trouble
for minicomputer makers not named IBM, and Data General was no
exception. While the new 32-bit MV series (the subject of the classic
<i>The Soul of a New Machine</i>) was their first unqualified success in
years, the expense of its development combined with cheaper
microcomputers eroding their mainstay 16-bit sales made it impossible to
launch another large technical undertaking. To preserve cashflow,
smaller projects thus became the order of the day, and one of these was
to develop a microcomputer of DG’s own that could nevertheless still
provide market support for their larger systems. Mindful of Digital’s
own disastrous attempts like the DEC Rainbow in 1982, DG decided to take
on the portable segment where there were relatively few competitors and
they could stand out more easily.</p>

<p>Designed cooperatively by DG and its Japanese subsidiary Nippon Data
General, the DG-1 hit most of its marks. Not least of its innovations
was its size and weight (less than 14” by 12” or about 35cm by 30cm,
three inches thick and around ten pounds or five kilos) as well as the
720K 3.5” floppy drives and custom full-size monochrome LCD panel, both
manufactured by Epson. The built-in modem option and internal
communications program made it a portable option for existing customers
who needed a Dasher terminal on the road (and emphasized that Data
General hardware was preferred) and it was at least as DOS-compatible as
most other non-IBM PCs were at the time (provided you stuck to BIOS
calls, that is).</p>

DG also intended it to have a constellation of expansion peripherals.
The rear docking port could allow connection to an external chassis for
a hard disk, an external monitor or other expansion options, depicted
here from a marketing photo. With a 4MHz 80C88 CPU, the base 128K of
memory and a single floppy, expandable to two drives and 512K, it had an
announced MSRP of $2895 (about $8660 in 2024 dollars) and hit the market
in November 1984. An optional battery-powered thermal printer sold for
an additional $500 ($1500).
<p>
<p>While early users raved about its portability and power (Peter Norton

even its boosters found the LCD’s legibility notoriously poor,
especially as it wasn’t backlit and the earliest models did not have an
adjustable screen tilt. A potentially greater concern was that most DOS
software still came on 5.25” floppies at the time, for which the DG-1
required a separate wall-powered unit connected to the expansion port.
Data General addressed the first problem in less than six months with an
updated display that could lock in multiple angles using a
higher-contrast “reverse” polarizer and removing the lens. Customers
agreed it was an improvement — as you’ll see it could hardly have been
worse — and it was sold new for the same MSRP, but existing customers
had to pay $350 for the upgrade despite Data General’s claims the
upgrade was sold at a loss. As less than 10,000 had been sold to that
point, the market damage was lessened. This updated first generation
system is what we’ll be working with here.</p>

<p>In those days PCs weren’t yet (entirely) commodities, and Data
General was determined to make the DG-1 a distinctive upmarket product.
The DG-1 official carrying case was a sharp plush job designed by Pierre
Cardin with an embroidered Data General logo and internal compartments
for the power supplies (yes, plural) and wall and phone cords. Even the
open-cell foam was higher quality, not the rubbishy stuff you find today
sloughing off into tarry filth over other items of the era. Unified
branding covered the packaging, the display lid, the bag tag, …</p>

The keyboard is also custom. All PC keys of the era are present except
for SysRq and Pause (Break was moved to the Escape key), but some have
been moved to other places to save space, such as Page Up/Down and
Home/End using SHIFT plus arrow keys, and some function differently such
as Ctrl-Num Lock to pause scrolling despite there being an actual Scroll
Lock key. For function key jockeys, DG thoughtfully included a
removable, writeable cheat card whose tabs fit neatly into slots above
the keyboard.
<p>
<p>Three keys are unique to the DG-1: a Cmd (Command) key, used for
specific key combinations by the ROM, plus a Spcl (Special) key and a
blank (!) key that are unexplained by the manual or the tutorial and
don’t seem to do anything in the U.S. layout. I suspect these key
positions are used by the keyboard layouts for other languages and later
iterations of the DG/One employed it as another type of Alt key. In
another nice touch, an outcropping on the display bezel will
automatically flip the power switch to off when you close the lid.</p>

Curiously, the battery was an option and not standard. A large Ni-Cad
block fits here with a connector, adding a couple extra pounds but also
around eight hours of runtime. The paper clip is used to push down a
small tab to slide off the top of the compartment.
<p>
<p>I mentioned power suppl<em>ies</em> (plural): in early models, the
charger for the battery was a separate unit and connected to a separate
port. Even in this updated model where the power supply for battery and
main power is now one unit, it still requires a separate cable to the
battery charge port. I don’t have the battery, so I don’t have either
the original sidecar supply or the cable, but I also don’t have leaky
NiCd guts all over the inside of the machine either.</p>

Those power ports, and all the others, are on the rear. The ports are
protected by a sliding cover which also acts as a laptop stand when the
cover is open, another nice design touch. Unfortunately, none of these
ports is fully standard. The 5-pin DIN at the far left is the phone
connector for the internal modem option, here the later 1200 baud card
(early models with the internal modem option were limited to 300bps),
which terminates in a regular RJ-11 phone jack that DG also included a
T-coupler for. Next to it is the RS-232 port, a seemingly regular DB-25
except if pins 13 and 25 are grounded to make it an RS-422 interface
instead (so your connector must not touch those pins). In a like
fashion, the printer port next to it is not a parallel port: it’s a
serial port too, just without the modem lines, intended for DG’s
battery-powered thermal printer. This printer expects data at 9600bps
8N1 and is basically a teletype without the “type.” The two plugs next
to it are a barrel jack for the battery charging circuit and a two-pin
power port for the system’s main power, both 6.4V at either 2A or 3A.
<p>
<p>Below that is the expansion port, but I don’t have anything that
connects to it. While I know the external 5.25” drive exists (model
2233), I’ve never seen the 2235 expansion chassis, though I have seen a
smaller 2234 “dock expander” that also connects here. This expander is
thumbscrewed onto the back over the rear ports using the two standoffs
near the bottom. Although it replicates the printer and power ports, it
blocks the RS-232 and modem ports in lieu of a 37-pin floppy disk
connector and two external monitor ports (DE-9 and BNC, presumably CGA
and composite). Since the whole concept with the DG-1 was portable
communications, this particular option didn’t seem especially well
thought-out.</p>

<p>On the underside of the unit are the labels. These upgraded units
have a hastily pasted-on model sticker over the original model
designation which varied based on the factory options. This machine has,
near as I can tell, the maximum available internal configuration: 512K
of RAM (128K base and three additional 128K RAM cards), a second floppy
disk drive and an internal 1200bps modem. I always found the handwritten
serial number on this machine’s lower label to be interesting. On
modem-equipped machines an additional FCC sticker was supposed to be in
the lower right well of the embossed plastic label, but this unit
doesn’t have one for some reason.</p>

<p>Oh yeah: the screen. Let me preface this paragraph by saying that our
machine’s LCD here has degenerated further and we’re going to
compensate, but despite the significant engineering resources put into
its fabrication, even at its best and even at the time everyone agreed
it was <em>bad</em>. <i>InfoWorld</i> in 1985 called it “godawful” and
“a better mirror than [a] display,” and even Peter Norton admitted its
readability “isn’t too good.” <i>PC Magazine</i> 7/86 retrospectively
theorized that achieving sufficient contrast and visibility wasn’t
feasible at the time with such a large panel, adding, “The exchange ‘Why
don’t you turn it on? / It <em>is</em> on’ is no joke. It happened in
our offices.” There isn’t an ideal tilt position for the display owing
to its limited viewing angles, but you can get a sense of the original
contrast level with the first couple lines of text.</p>

<p>At this point in photography the floppy eject buttons chose to come
off again, so we’ll start the refurb there. The buttons attach with two
prongs, a long one and short one, and it looks like the long ones (on
the left in this picture) just plain snapped off. We need to make sure
that whatever fix we implement lets us still remove the eject buttons to
get into the case, so I chose to go with Velcro here: I cut some Velcro
loop material to the proper size and punched holes in it where the
button prongs would have fit, then made a little roll of Velcro hooks to
go next to the intact short prong to act as a replacement long
prong.</p>

<p>Pressed in firmly, this is enough to let the small prong engage with
its receptacle and then hold it there with the Velcro, but the eject
button can still be popped off if necessary. As a nice consequence,
every press on the eject button will keep the grip maintained. Having
done, let’s take them off again for the floppy drive swap and to replace
the CMOS battery, since we’ll need to disassemble the machine to do
those tasks.</p>

through the holes in its track, and then remove the exposed screws.
Despite the appearance of only two types of screws, there are actually
five: six of one type on the left which hold in the floppy drives, three

<p>Now turn the unit back over and remove the side panel covering the
floppy drive(s) and the corresponding panel on the left side of the
machine with a spudger (they’re held in with tabs). To make a rigid
“sandwich,” Data General decided to hold the unit together with metal
snaps, three on each side. These pop out by wedging a small blade or
metal spatula into the depressions next to them. Be careful, they’re in
tight! When putting them back on at the end, make sure not to get one in
the floppy drive like I did or you’ll have to get the drive back out

<p>As with all laptops, there are invariably ribbon cables connecting
the two halves. While the DG-1 has two ribbon cable connectors, only one
of them actually has a ribbon cable in it which goes to the display.
Open the battery compartment with your paper clip, disconnect and remove
the battery (duh) if present, and then through the hole at the bottom
gently lift the top of the occupied connector and slip out the display
ribbon cable.</p>

The top half then simply lifts up and to the side (the battery connector
will slip out free on its own, but mind the connector for the power
switch, which can be disconnected if you need to completely separate
both halves). You may need to do a little wiggling around to get it out
of its moorings; it’s probably easiest to start from the back. Unlike
many laptops where you need to remove the keyboard first, you should not
do that here, at least not to get into the case.
<p>
<p>With the top off we can see the A: drive (closest to the keyboard)
and next to it towards the back a stack of two other cards we’ll have to
remove to get to the B: drive. These are all connected with Molex ribbon
cables. The power board and DC-DC converter is on the backside
perpendicular to the mainboard with the power switch and battery
connectors wired to it. The other main landmark is a silver box marked
with “UPGRADE MEMORY CARDS SHOULD BE ADDED IN ORDER FROM THE TOP
DOWN.”</p>

<p>That silver box has three little connectors for the RAM expansion
cards, 128K each (model 2252). They are completely populated in this
maximally expanded machine and the box can be pulled off the mainboard
(we won’t do that this time around) if they need to be swapped. Under
the box and not shown here is a Mitsubishi M5M82C37, a CMOS
second-source version of the Intel 8237 four-channel DMA controller. The
base 128K of RAM is on the underside of the mainboard, so with the three
cards we have our 512K.</p>

Next to the memory expansion box are two chips, the 32K 27C256 system
EPROM (here marked copyright 1984, 1985 NDG, i.e., Nippon Data General,
and the code 5699-02) and the CPU itself, an Oki Electronic 80C88.
On-screen this ROM revision identifies itself as version 1.21; I have
not seen a more recent version of this system ROM for the original
DG/One. The 80C88 is a CMOS version of the Intel 8088 and can operate
from 0 (completely stopped and static) to 8MHz, though here the nominal
clock speed is 4MHz. That’s slower than the 4.77MHz IBM PC/XT but the
underclocking achieves additional power savings.
<p>
<p>Both chips are socketed and of course the EPROM could be erased and
rewritten, which yields potential for fun upgrades like hacking the
built-in software. I did think about replacing the 80C88 with the more
performant pin-compatible NEC V20, but I’m not sure how well the chip
would run downclocked to “just” 4MHz (the datasheet gives the lowest
speed as 5MHz) nor on a battery, and even if it doesn’t utterly blow the
machine up we may need to make some adjustments to the ROM for
timing-sensitive routines. A project for another day.</p>

The keyboard is not attached by anything at this point other than its
ribbon cable, so we can swing it up and out of the way to expose two
more main ICs. The Mitsubishi chip on the right is an M5M82C59AP,
another CMOS second source version, this time of the venerable Intel
8259 programmable interrupt controller. The custom DG chip in the middle
is marked 4658-01 (the 8452E7 looks like a date code based on the
copyright year). I don’t have the systems guide for this machine so I’m
not sure what this chip does, but best guess is it handles the video and
possibly the keyboard. Other versions of the board I’ve seen have a DG
sticker covering up a UV window, suggesting this is a microcontroller of
some sort with onboard ROM; nearby Intel markings on that chip hint at
possibly an Intel 8751, a microcontroller from the Intel MCS-51 family
with 4K of EPROM, and that would be the right number of pins. We last
encountered the 8051 in the
<a href="/2023/09/the-spawn-of-atarilab-and-universal.html">Universal
Lab Interface</a>, the spiritual descendant of the AtariLab.
<p>
<p>The little metal boxes here sheathe crystals. Next to the 4658 is a
3.579545MHz oscillator, likely for composite NTSC colourburst (another
reason to theorize the 4658 contains the video circuit), and beside the
82C59A are 11.9808MHz and 10MHz oscillators. The 10MHz is most likely
divided down to generate the CPU and system clocks, while the 11.9808MHz
crystal is probably the clock for the 4658, assuming it is indeed an
MCS-51 (most instructions take about twelve clock cycles).</p>

<p>This card is the optional model 2750 1200bps modem card, another
8051-based device (an Oki 80C51 on a 7.3754MHz crystal). The 5-pin DIN
connector is electrically a regular telephone modular jack and the same
wires are present. The modem responds to the standard Hayes AT command
set of the time and has a license for the Hayes escape sequence. If you
send it an <tt>ATI0</tt> command, it will return the PCB type and
revision, in this case <tt>120</tt>.</p>

<p>Under that is the I/O board, our first stop. The CMOS settings
battery is here, a CR2025, and as expected it is completely dead. We’ll
replace that when we put this back together. The other main chips on top
are an NEC μPD765AC (D765AC), which is the floppy drive controller, and
an Epson SED9420C variable-frequency oscillator (VFO) data separator
with MFM sync field detection, loop filter switching and timer
functions. Interestingly, its datasheet only mentions use with 8” and
5.25” drives, but Epson chose to use it here as well. Along the back are
the two serial ports (modem and printer), protected by three Tokin D-05N
data line filters.</p>

Turned over at top left, the card has two Oki M82C51A USARTs, CMOS
versions of the Intel 8251 that is not register-compatible with the more
common 8250 UART. This was a source of some incompatibility with
communications software that expected 8250s to be present and tried to
drive them directly (programs that used slower BIOS calls through
<tt>int 14h</tt> usually worked). They are each accompanied by an Oki
M82C55A (Intel 8255) for interfacing.

<p>Unfortunately, these disk drives are not commonly found anymore,
which is why we’re just going to switch them for the time being. The

Before reinstalling the disk drives we must rejumper them first (the
floppy cable doesn’t set primary and secondary for you). The primary in
front should have the jumper across the DSO pins; the secondary in rear
should have the jumper across the pins labeled “1” (one). Reinstall the
drives, plug back in the I/O card, reattach the port standoffs, plug
back in the modem card, screw it in place, make sure the keyboard is
back down, and shimmy the top case back on (watch out for the power
switch and battery cables). I do not recommend putting in the screws or
reattaching the display cable <em>until the snaps are all on</em>
because if one decides to break free, you may need to disassemble the
machine again to go find it. Once all six snaps are on and secured, then
put the screws back in, reconnect the display cable, and put back on the
side panels, floppy eject buttons and the battery compartment door.
Whew!

<p>Now, that screen. While never good I think it’s obvious this is worse
than it ought to be, and the mottled contrast suggested a degenerating
LCD polarizer. Most twisted nematic LCDs have a 45-degree polarizer and
this is widely available as cling film but we can’t assume that here
because of the custom Epson display. I ended up buying a couple
Chinamazon sheets with a 0-degree line to test it. Both were smaller
than the LCD, which is roughly 8.5” by 6.75”, but it was an easy way to
find out what I was actually dealing with. Also, by trying the film, we
shouldn’t be doing anything to the screen we can’t undo later. Before
opening the case I tried it out:</p>

<p>Here it is without the bezel. The bezel is actually only held on by a
lip at the bottom and two snaps at the top. It came out a little more
bubblicious than I’d like because this particular screen had a bit of a
hard life with little bits embedded in it I could not clean off (and
rubbing it made alarming shimmers in the LCD, so I didn’t feel much like
going at it with something slightly more abrasive). As a result, even
with a couple tries and squeegeeing all the way, the little embedded
bits leave bubbles and those aren’t going away. It’s like trying to
apply a PDA screen protector but five times bigger and ten times
worse.</p>

But with the machine fired up the display is now much more legible (and
it’s possible to adjust the contrast a bit in software, read on). Still,
it could obviously be a lot better if we got rid of the join line and
the bubbles.
<p>
I thought about some alternatives. The most obvious is to apply a larger
sheet of film and/or buy a 45 degree polarized sheet of sufficient
dimension since we’ve established this is otherwise a TN panel. On the
other hand, while that should eliminate the join line, any adhesive film
will still run into the same problems with the surface that this one
did.
<p>
The other thought is to get a new clear acrylic plate cut to size and
put the film on that, and then put the plate in front of the screen.
(There are polarized acrylic sheets also, but the quotes I was getting
were substantially more expensive than just regular acrylic and
polarizing film together.) The ~4mm bevel depth gives space for such a
plate to sink into, well within typical stock thicknesses here in the
United States, and unless I really mess up there should be no bubbles.
However, since the edges of the screen are tapered, something would have
to keep it in place or it will slip down (and out). Since we’re still
working with polymers, I suppose I could try
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_materials#Transparent_aluminum">transparent
aluminum</a> later. All that said, none of these alternatives would
yield significantly better contrast — if at all — so for the purposes of
this article let’s go with what we have.

<p>The internal 32K ROM contains a simple terminal program, text editor,
setup utility and basic diagnostics. It is entered either by turning on
the machine with no disks to boot from, or pressing Ctrl-Alt-Cmd in DOS.
It is <em>not</em> a built-in TSR or some such: the only way back to DOS
is through a restart.</p>

The Notebook is the text editor. The manual says it can hold up to 500
lines of 80-column text, though lines may not have more than 80 columns
and joining long lines will cause them to be automatically broken at the
80 column margin. You can do basic editing, search and replace, and
printing. The text in the buffer can also be transmitted in the
Terminal, and you can also add data from the Terminal.
<p>
<p>How does it write to disk without DOS? Simple: it doesn’t. If you
turn off the machine, it’s gone. Transmit it, print it or lose it.</p>

<p>The Terminal program can emulate either a Data General Dasher D2
(“DGC Terminal”) or a Lear-Siegler ADM3A (“Std Terminal”). We had
multiple ADM3A clones on campus at the time, so I’m quite sure it was
used in that capacity. It can either use the internal modem or an
external modem or null modem at up to 9600bps. There is no hardware flow
control, but XON/XOFF is supported with the “OFC Mode” (Output Flow of
Control). You can send a document in the Notebook buffer, or you can
receive data <em>into</em> the Notebook, to which it is appended. You
can switch into and out of the Notebook and Terminal without dropping
the connection.</p>

<p>The diagnostics mode is not too useful because it only tests memory
and attached disk drives, without any other confidence testing, and all
the tests are destructive (you’ll lose contents of memory, contents of
any scratch disks used for testing, etc.). If there is bad memory, the
test will report a value <tt>x:yyy:z</tt> where <tt>x</tt> is (0)
onboard RAM or (1-3) one of the expansion cards, <tt>yyy</tt> is the
chip number in decimal, and <tt>z</tt> is whether it was (0) a

<p>Last but not least is setup. Now that we have the battery replaced,
we can actually save our settings. The defaults are generally
appropriate but notice that the number of disk drives is not
automatically detected: you need to tell the machine you have two or
three drives, as appropriate. This allows you to have only one drive but
connect the external 5.25” drive, for example, which is also a valid
two-drive configuration. We’ll select two disk drives, commit the
settings, and boot from the DOS floppy.</p>

<p>I don’t have the original Data General disks, just copies. The first
disk contains Data General’s customized version of MS-DOS 2.11 on a
single bootable 720K floppy. Notice that we start off with only 464K of
RAM despite 512K in the machine because 48K is used for vampire video
(so a basic 128K system would only have 80K available). The use of
MS-DOS 2.11 is particularly interesting because support for 720K 3.5”
floppies didn’t officially exist in MS-DOS until the OEM release of

<p>Besides the general tools of the period — but notice no on-disk BASIC
— there are a few DG-specific utilities. The <tt>PRN_SET<em>.EXE</tt>
utilities set the printer character set in use and <tt>VDISK.COM</tt>
provides a RAM disk driver (<tt>DEVICE=VDISK.COM </em>xxx</tt> where
<tt>xxx</tt> is the number of kilobytes, minimum 16K). This drive
appears as D: and you can have multiple ones (E:, F:, etc.), but I found
it much less useful with a two-drive system. I’m not sure what
<tt>GRAPHICS.COM</tt> does; it only has a DG string in it and a small
amount of code, and is not documented in the user’s guide.</p>

<p>I mentioned there is software contrast adjustment, though I would
call it optimistic at best. The Cmd-PageDown combination lightens the
screen and Cmd-PageUp darkens it (the “Try it now !” is blinking, so
just ignore it and focus on the rest of the text). The text does indeed
darken with higher contrast settings, but the rest of the screen darkens
somewhat too, so the actual incremental improvement is small. I’ve
chosen to go a little light here so the bubbles in the polarizer film
are less in my face.</p>

The demo disk culminates in a simulation of how you might connect to the
Dow Jones News/Retrieval® service. To save your eyes, here is the
complete session as we log on to find out how Data General’s stock is
doing tonight (spoiler alert: it’s <em>super</em> and you should buy
now). Notice that in those days this went through the national Telenet
X.25 network,
<a href="/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">the same
way you’d log onto The Source</a> and many other online services.

for the stock ticker, though.

Recall that Telenet addresses more or less resembled North American
Numbering Plan area codes, so the local concentrator answering here was
a node in area code 617, then the eastern half of Data General’s home
state of Massachusetts. Terminal code D1 is a dumb terminal equivalent.
The prompt <tt>WHAT SERVICE PLEASE????</tt> was not an exaggeration:
<a href="http://phrack.org/issues/42/10.html#article">others have
documented</a> this string on several nodes in area code 609, which was
then southern New Jersey. These were apparently large timesharing minis
that handled multiple services but I don’t know who operated them.
<tt>//CQ</tt>, <tt>DGN</tt> and <tt>DISC</tt> were Dow Jones commands
for “current quote,” Data General’s stock ticker symbol, and to
disconnect.

<p>MS-DOS 2.11 basically works and particularly for Ones with small RAM
ceilings may well be the best choice, but it lacks the creature comforts
of later DOSes. With sufficient memory it should be possible to run at
least MS-DOS 6.x and possibly even 7.x in a basic sense, but at the time
I first played with it Caldera had just made DR-DOS 7.02 free for
non-commercial use and I ended up using it instead. DR-DOS booted pretty
well for the simple tasks I used it for until the front drive started
complaining about files on the extreme periphery of the disk and at that
point it went back in the Pierre Cardin bag. Let’s get out the USB

<p>The most obvious choice today would be FreeDOS, but aside from it
wanting a hard disk to install to, that didn’t end up working out so
well for other reasons. Although over the years FreeDOS has
intermittently come in unofficial one-disk variations, most of them
unmaintained, nearly none of these could fit on a 720K floppy. However,
one notable exception was ODIN, which specifically advertised a 720K
floppy version that
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freedos/mailman/message/5156384/">packed
a fair bit of the disk with UPX</a>. ODIN has long since disappeared
from the Web but you can still get the last 0.6 release
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060503040231/http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/pc-stuff/freedos/files/distributions/1disk/odin060/">from
the Wayback Machine</a> in a version that was advertised as compatible
with the 8086. Maybe it was, but not with the DG-1:</p>

It would boot and start the kernel, and then the command prompt would
appear to start, but as soon as you tried to press any key you’d get
<tt>Invalid Opcode at 996C F000 F246 00CF 0070 0894 001E 00CF 0001 0004
0080 01C1 0070</tt> and lock up so hard the machine had to be powered
off at the switch. The “mainstream” 720K packed floppy didn’t even get
<em>that</em> far.
<p>
<p>More recently was
<a href="https://svarog86.sourceforge.net/">Svarog86</a>, the precursor
to today’s <a href="http://svardos.org/">SvarDOS</a>. I would have used
that except I didn’t find an obvious 720K one-disk version whereas
Svarog86
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/svarog86/files/2015-05-29/">did
indeed offer one</a>. These use newer FreeDOS kernels than ODIN and both
Svarog86 and SvarDOS prominently advertise their 8086 compatibility,
which should work just dandy on the 8088 as well. Unfortunately, it blew
up even more explosively when you touched a key.</p>

Not only did we get a invalid opcode crash, we even got a divide-by-zero
error: <tt>Invalid Opcode at 996C F000 F246 00D8 0070 03B6 0626 00D8
0006 0019 0100 0528 0070</tt> followed by <tt>Interrupt divide by zero

0000</tt>. The invalid opcode trace in particular seems similar to the
other fault in ODIN modulo the different kernel version, but I’m not
aware of the 80C88 not supporting any opcodes the 8088 or 8086 do, so I
don’t know exactly what’s wrong. Most likely there’s just something
weird about the hardware in the DG-1 that FreeDOS simply doesn’t like,
perhaps the absence of a conventional keyboard.
<p>
<p>But DR-DOS isn’t bothered by any of this, probably because it sticks
to BIOS calls and doesn’t assume anything about the hardware. So I
decided to tune up the disk I had by removing a few unnecessary things
like <tt>HIMEM.SYS</tt> (doesn’t work on the DG) and <tt>SERNO.EXE</tt>
(irrelevant) and <tt>TASKMGR.INI</tt> (hahaha). I had already added a
simple editor (the Manx port of <tt>vi</tt> as used in
<a href="http://aztecmuseum.ca/intro.htm">Aztec C</a>) and my own basic
paging utility <tt>MOO.EXE</tt> that I had written a couple years

While I think about what I’ll do for the screen next time this comes out
of the bag, let’s finish our story, as we always must. While this
updated release mitigated the display’s issues, it did not end
complaints about it, and more advanced (and more readable) LCD panels of
similar dimensions started appearing on competitors’ systems. By July
1986 PC Magazine had dropped it from its regular roundup of DOS laptops
because “[t]he combination of low contrast and high price proved all but
fatal to the DG/One and it’s no longer a factor in today’s market.”
<!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=5hdeC0k_JHwC&pg=PA110&dq=%22PC+Magazine%22+%22Data+General%22+joke&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjR97D3uJyFAxVJIkQIHZlBC5UQ6AF6BAgEEAI#v=onepage&q=%22PC%20Magazine%22%20%22Data%20General%22%20joke&f=false -->
<p>
Data General apparently took feedback like this to heart. In October
1985 it slashed prices by hundreds of dollars while developing the next
iteration. Waiting until IBM had fired its next bolt with the 5140 IBM
PC Convertible in April 1986, DG introduced the Data General/One Model
Two in May with a higher contrast LCD and two new SKUs using an ELD
instead, one of which even had a 10MB hard disk and a full 640K of RAM.
However, the ELD required so much power it reduced runtime to just one
or two hours and the CPU was still the same 4MHz 80C88.
<p>
In May 1987 Data General upgraded the Model Two into the Model 2T. The
CPU was bumped to the full XT speed of 4.77MHz (or could run turbo at
7.16MHz if you wanted), two expansion slots were in-chassis, and it came
in both backlit supertwist LCD and ELD variants each with the 10MB hard
disk option. The ELD version could not run on battery power, but the LCD
version could, with advanced power management features that even could
control current to individual laptop components. Despite complaints
about the persistently non-standard keyboard, reviewers nevertheless
heartily approved. “Finally,” raved PC Magazine in July, “a modern
laptop out of Data General!” In October 1987 InfoWorld lauded its
performance and EMS capability and called the 2T “well-thought-out” and
“a very good value.” The Model 2T was adopted internally at Data General
as the “Pharaoh” testing and diagnostics rig using a large attached
sidecar module, and it was also rebadged as the
<a href="https://www.artisantg.com/PLC/76091-2/Rockwell-Allen-Bradley-1784-T45-Portable-Terminal">Allen-Bradley
T45 Portable Programming Terminal</a>. In February 1988 DG added a new
backlit blue LCD and a 2400bps modem option.
<p>
<p>These bright spots notwithstanding, the size and design of the DG/One
even in its more advanced iterations were no longer popular with the
market, and it was quietly discontinued around 1991. In fact, its
replacement had already arrived two years earlier: the five-pound 1989
Data General Walkabout, which had its own built-in modem and
ROM-resident terminal and text editor, plus a phone book, dialer and
alarm scheduler and ran on AA batteries or Ni-Cad. Unfortunately, buyers
weren’t interested in a portable terminal either, and an attempt to
expand it into a 386 laptop with the Walkabout/SX (also rebadged as the
Allen-Bradley T47) and successors failed to sell due to weight, price
and ergonomics. Data General cancelled the line in 1993, and with its
only major remaining success in storage systems, DG was bought out by
competitor EMC in 1999 and quickly dismantled — in the process selling
its venerable <tt>dg.com</tt> domain name to Dollar General. DG’s
remaining IP now rests with Dell, who bought EMC as a subsidiary in
2016.</p>

Trump encouraged his supporters to buy a “God Bless The USA” Bible for
$59.99. The Bible is my “favorite book,” he said in a promotional video,
and said he owns “many.” This Bible includes the U.S. Constitution, the
Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Pledge of

a 2021 Bible Greenwood pushed to commemorate the twentieth anniversary

<h2 id="us-powerball-jackpot-jumps-to-975-million">US Powerball jackpot
jumps to $975 million</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DES MOINES, Iowa — The Powerball jackpot climbed to an estimated $975
million after no one matched the six numbers drawn Saturday night,
continuing a nearly three-month stretch without a big winner.</p>
<p>The winning numbers drawn were: 12, 13, 33, 50, 52 and the red
Powerball 23.</p>
<p>No one has won Powerball’s top prize since New Year’s Day when a
ticket in Michigan hit for $842.4 million, bringing the number of
consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner to 38. That winless streak
nears the record of 41 consecutive drawings, set twice in 2022 and
2021.</p>
<p>The $975 million prize is for a sole winner who chooses an annuity
paid over 30 years. A winner opting for cash would be paid $471.7
million. The prizes would be subject to federal taxes, and many states
also tax lottery winnings.</p>
<p>As the prizes grow, the drawings attract more ticket sales and the
jackpots subsequently become harder to hit. The game’s long odds for
Saturday’s drawing were 1 in 292.2 million.</p>
<p>Powerball is played in 45 states plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico
and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

<h2 id="maptwin-an-80s-era-automotive-navigation-computer">Maptwin: an
80s-era automotive navigation computer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-03-31, from: OS News</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I imported a Japanese-market 4×4 van into the
US; a 1996 Mitsubishi Delica. Based on the maps I found in the seat
pocket and other clues, it seems to have spent its life at some city
dweller’s cabin in the mountains around Fukushima, and only driven
occasionally. Despite being over 25 years old, it only had 77,000 km on
the odometer. The van had some interesting old tech installed in it:
what appears to be a radar detector labeled “Super Eagle ✔️30” and a
Panasonic-brand electronic toll collection device that you can insert a
smart card into. One particularly noteworthy accessory that was
available in mid-90s Delicas was a built-in karaoke machine for the rear
passengers. Sadly, mine didn’t have that feature. But the most
interesting accessory installed in the van was the Avco Maptwin Inter,
which I immediately identified as some kind of electronic navigation
aid, about which there is very little information available on the
English-language internet. When I first saw the Maptwin, I had thought
it might be some kind of proto-GPS that displayed latitude/longitude
coordinates that you could look up on a paper map. Alas, it’s not that
cool. It was not connected to any kind of antenna, and the electronics
inside seem inadequate for the reception of a GPS signal. The Maptwin
was, however, wired into an RPM counter that was attached between the
transmission and the speedometer cable, presumably to delivery extremely
accurate and convenient display of how many kilometers have been
traveled since the display was last reset. What I’ve been able to learn
is that the Maptwin is computer that was mostly used for rally race
navigation, precursor to devices still available from manufacturers like
Terra Trip. Now, the Mitsubishi Delica is about the best 4×4 minivan you
can get, but it’s extremely slow and unwieldy at speed, so it would be
pretty terrible for rally racing. My best guess is that the owner used
this device as a navigation aid for overland exploration, as the name
“Maptwin” implies, to augment the utility of a paper map. On the other
hand, I found an article that indicates that some kinds of rallies were
not high speed affairs, but rather accuracy-based navigation puzzles of
sorts, so who knows? The Maptwin wasn’t working when I got the van, and
I don’t know if it’s actually broken or just needs to be wired up
correctly. If any OSNews readers have any additional information about
any of the devices I’ve mentioned, please enlighten us in the comments.
If anyone would like to try to get the Maptwin working and report back,
please let me know.</p>
