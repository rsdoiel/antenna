<h2 id="i-want-all-the-information">I want all the information</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-03, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
<img class="imgRightMargin" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2022/08/08/bootstrappingByEngelbart.png" border="0" style="float: right; padding-left: 25px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 10px; padding-right: 15px;">I
want all the information about the products I make to be instantly
available to anyone who wants to know, in exactly the form they want it.
Until ChatGPT, that was a totally unattainable dream. But now, for many
topics, it’s reality. For example, if I have a question about CSS, and
believe me, I do – if I can ask the question clearly enough, I can get a
clear and complete explanation of why the browser did the crazy thing
with layout that it did. It means I could do something beautiful and
refined like the blogroll I worked on in February and March, and the UI
stuff I’m working on in March and April.
</p>
<p>
I can’t wait until ChatGPT can answer all those questions about my
stuff. But then people who make music don’t want their songs to be
available the same way. As someone who wants to know as much as possible
about songs I have always loved but had no idea how they were made, or
what they meant to the writer, knowledge about the work is equally
valuable as understanding technical topics. I think the big difference
is knowing that life is short, and if we want to leave something behind
of ourselves, having the information be available is a blessing, not
something to fight against. I don’t see why software designers in the
future should have to reinvent what my generation has already figured
out. I don’t want them to have to. It keeps coming back to this one idea
– to solve the problems we have as a species we’re going to have to
<i>work together, </i>and part of that means not being so guarded and
selfish about sharing what we’ve learned.
</p>
<p>
We had this problem with music before, with Napster. The users of music,
such as myself, found that the ability to program our own music was so
liberating. To listen to a song a few times before moving on made a huge
difference, or to choose a song to hear because we just thought of it
for the first time in 30 years. But we were literally mocked by music
promoters and artists. But ultimately, like it or not, the users got the
power they wanted. It’s got to happen that way too for ChatGPT et al. I
guess some people must’ve felt that search engines were going to rob
creative people of control of their creations. I guess this is something
we always have to go through.

<p>
<a class="account" href="https://dice.camp/@rdonoghue" title="@rdonoghue@dice.camp"><span
class="citation" data-cites="rdonoghue">@rdonoghue</span></a> wondered
(mostly ironically, I suspect) about a correlation between the length of
the commute and a propensity to favour Return To the Office (RTO)
policies.
</p>
<p>
I used to walk 35min to the office and I still prefer the home office.
</p>
<p>
Based on what I saw during lockdown and based on what my wife tells me,
I think more interesting options are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do you have kids at home and prefer Return To the Office? (if older)
</li>
<li>
Do you have parents at home and prefer Return To the Office? (if
younger)
</li>
<li>
Do you manage a team but don’t talk to team members individually and
prefer Return To the Office because you can overhear them talk? (if
project manager)
</li>
<li>
Do you have a need for sycophants surrounding you and prefer Return To
the Office so you keep an eye on them? (ugh)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m sure there are more options but those seemed to be the obvious ones.
</p>
<p>
In all fairness:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do you have a hard time with focus and prefer the Home Office so that
you’re not exposed to noise, cross-talk and other distractions by
coworkers? (me)

id="chinese-state-social-media-echo-russian-propaganda-on-concert-hall-attack">Chinese
state, social media echo Russian propaganda on concert hall attack</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Taipei, Taiwan — Specious theories designed to implicate Ukraine and
the United States in connection with the late March terror attack in
Russia are spreading on China’s state media outlets and on its heavily
censored social media platform Weibo.</p>
<p>False claims that paint Kyiv and Washington as masterminds of the
attack have fueled debate in Russia even after Islamic State-Khorasan —
also known as IS, IS-K, ISIS and Daesh — claimed responsibility for
killing at least 143 people and injuring nearly 200 at the Crocus City
Hall music venue in suburban Moscow.</p>
<p>In China, an editorial in the state-run Global Times insinuated that
“many observers linked the incident to the ‘hybrid war’ form of the
Russia-Ukraine conflict.”</p>
<p>“Some Western thinkers have begun to speculate whether Washington had
played a role in this terrorist attack,” it said without
elaborating.</p>
<p>Without citing names or clear attribution, the Global Times repeated
Russia’s false accusations that the U.S. failed to share “key
intelligence” that could have helped Russian security services prevent
the attack.</p>
<p>In fact, the U.S. warned the Russian authorities two weeks before the
attack and shared appropriate intelligence, as it would do “for any
other country,” John Kirby, White House national security communications
adviser, told VOA.</p>
<p>“We provided useful, we believe, valuable information about what we
thought was an imminent terrorist attack,” Kirby said. “We also warned
Americans about staying away from public places like concert halls. So,
we were very direct with our Russian counterparts appropriately to make
sure that they had as much useful information as possible.”</p>
<p>Addressing a Russian intelligence agency board meeting three days
before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the U.S.
warning as “outright blackmail” intended “to intimidate and destabilize
our society.”</p>
<p>The Global Times also criticized Washington for being “slow to
condemn the incident in a timely manner, which shocked the international
community.”</p>
<p>In fact, the United States was among the first nations to condemn the
Moscow attack, and on March 30, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy
placed flowers at the site.</p>
<p>With the Chinese Communist Party’s tight censorship of online
content, contrarian views are quickly taken down, and the lack of
independent media leave disinformation spread by state-controlled news
outlets unchallenged.</p>
<p>Some, however, have voiced skepticism.</p>
<p>“I personally think it’s unlikely that the United States was behind
this terrorist attack,” Jin Canrong, a scholar of international
relations with an established “anti-American” reputation, wrote on
Weibo.</p>
<p>The comments by Jin, who is a professor at the Renmin University of
China, provoked heated reaction, with some Weibo users accusing him of
being a U.S. sympathizer.</p>
<p>Since the attack, conspiracy theories echoing Russian propaganda have
dominated the narrative on Weibo, typically boosted by anonymous
pro-Russian and pro-Chinese influencers with millions of followers.</p>
<p>Weibo influencer Drunk Rabbit posted to his nearly half a million
followers: “It is no wonder that the Russian people do not believe that
this was done by IS. They all firmly believe that Ukraine and its
masters who are at war with Russia planned and carried out this
atrocity.”</p>
<p>To prove the point, the user posted two side-by-side video clips
showing former U.S. Presidents Barak Obama and Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Drunk Rabbit​’s caption read: “Obama: ‘We trained ISIS,’” and “Trump:
‘Obama was the founder of ISIS.’”</p>
<p>“Both former presidents have confirmed that the United States is the
creator of ISIS,” Drunk Rabbit continued. “Regarding the terrorist
attack on the Moscow Concert Hall in Russia, what other evidence is
needed?”</p>
<p>The quotes by Obama and Trump, however, are taken out of context and,
in the case of Obama’s remarks, twisted to mean the opposite of what he
said.</p>
<p>Trump’s claim has been debunked by fact-checkers and terrorism
experts who traced Islamic State’s roots to 2002, six years before Obama
was elected president, and Trump himself walked the remark back, calling
it “sarcasm.”</p>
<p>It is not out of character for the Chinese state and social media to
echo Russian propaganda and disinformation, especially when it targets
the United States.</p>

The National Weather Service experienced an outage yesterday morning
just as a line of severe storms ripped across the Midwest. The
disruption lasted for five hours, during which time about 50 storm
alerts, including tornado warnings, were issued across the region.
“Meteorologists around the Midwest were without key information that

went out to the public late, if at all,”<em> The Washington Post

yesterday. Snowpack is California’s largest source of stored water, so
if it’s low in April – as it has been in recent years following historic
droughts – residents know they should brace for water shortages in the
summer months to come. On the flipside, if the snowpack is way above
average, as it was last year, there’s a chance of flooding. But this
year, levels are at about 110%, or just above average. Still, Governor
Gavin Newsom wants residents to be mindful of their water use because
“this time next year, we might be in a different place.” He said the
state is preparing for a near-term future in which climate change will
make water even more scarce, and is considering options like
desalination and water recycling. Here is a look at how 2015 snowpack

<p>
Multigenerational living arrangements began to decline in the 1950s,
thanks to the growth of suburbs, new job opportunities for those willing
to move and the rise of senior housing. Yet from 1971 to 2021, the
number of people living in multigenerational family households
quadrupled. Why? Housing affordability plays a big role. But first: How
might Taiwan’s major earthquake impact the global supply chain for

Stability AI’s founder tanked his billion-dollar startup</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-03, from: OS News</p>
<p>It was Stability’s armada of GPUs, the wildly powerful and equally
expensive chips undergirding AI, that were so taxing the company’s
finances. Hosted by AWS, they had long been one of Mostaque’s bragging
points; he often touted them as one of the world’s 10 largest
supercomputers. They were responsible for helping Stability’s
researchers build and maintain one of the top AI image generators, as
well as break important new ground on generative audio, video and 3D
models. “Undeniably, Stability has continued to ship a lot of models,”
said one former employee. “They may not have profited off of it, but the
broader ecosystem benefitted in a huge, huge way.” But the costs
associated with so much compute were now threatening to sink the
company. According to an internal October financial forecast seen by
Forbes, Stability was on track to spend $99 million on compute in 2023.
It noted as well that Stability was “underpaying AWS bills for July (by
$1M)” and “not planning to pay AWS at the end of October for August
usage ($7M).” Then there were the September and October bills, plus $1
million owed to Google Cloud and $600,000 to GPU cloud data center
CoreWeave. (Amazon, Google and CoreWeave declined to comment.) ↫ Kenrick
Cai and Iain Martin As a Dutch person, I can smell a popping bubble from
a mile away, even if tulipmania is most likely anti-Dutch British
propaganda. In all seriousness, there’s definitely signs that the insane
energy and compute costs of artificial image and video generation in
particular are rising at such an insane pace it’s simply unsustainable
for the popularity of these tools to just keep rising. Eventually
someone’s going to have to pay, and I wonder just how much regular
people are willing to pay for this kind of stuff.</p>

<p>Amazon is phasing out its checkout-less grocery stores with “Just

company’s senior vice president of grocery stores says they’re moving
away from Just Walk Out, which relied on cameras and sensors to track
what people were leaving the store with. Just over half of Amazon Fresh
stores are equipped with Just Walk Out. The technology allows customers
to skip checkout altogether by scanning a QR code when they enter the
store. Though it seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied on
more than 1,000 people in India watching and labeling videos to ensure
accurate checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and they
watched you as you shopped. ↫ Maxwell Zeff Behind every Silicon Valley

<p>Even with that said, those gray-hairs will frequently claim that of
the many makers of floppies out there, 3M made the best ones. Given
that, I was curious to figure out exactly why 3M became the most
memorable brand in data storage during the formative days of computing,
and why it abandoned the product. ↫ Ernie Smith I do not remember if I
ever held any particular views on which brand of floppy disk (or
diskettes, as we called them) was the best. We had a wide variety of
brands, and I can’t recall any one of them being better than the other,
but then, I’m sure people in professional settings had more experience
with the little black squares and thus developed all kinds of feelings
about them.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
On December 14, 2020, at a little past 1 p.m., meteorologist Matthew
Cappucci sat down in the middle of a random field near the
Chilean-Argentinian border and cried because it was cloudy.
</p>
<p>
“To say I was devastated would be an understatement,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
Cappucci had traveled from his home in Washington, D.C., to Pucón,
Chile, to experience a total solar eclipse, only to be denied by an
atmospheric river. Under normal circumstances, he could have driven into
Argentina, where there were clear skies on the other side of the Andes,
but COVID travel restrictions were still in place and the border was
closed. His long months of planning and excitement, all dashed by a
couple last-minute rain clouds.
</p>
<p>
All that is to say, Cappucci understands better than most the importance
of making an immaculate eclipse-day forecast. In less than a week,
millions of Americans will flood the 115-mile-wide, 15-state-long path
of totality for the country’s last total solar eclipse until 2044. As
they do so, they’ll be relying on the predictions of local and national
meteorologists like Cappucci, an atmospheric scientist at
<a href="https://business.myradar.com/eclipse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MyRadar</a>
and the Capitol Weather Gang. “I will say that I’ve never personally
been more stressed about an event, nor been looking forward to something
as much,” Cappucci told me.
</p>
<p>
Weather teams across the country have been preparing for April 8, 2024,
since as early as 2017, when the last American total solar eclipse
occurred. There was a noticeable giddiness among the meteorologists I
spoke to; it’s fairly unusual for the public to have a high level of
interest in a forecast that <em>isn’t</em> potentially life-threatening.
“It’ll be really fun to get to be out there and not have to be in a
raincoat or have things flying through the air,” Alex Wilson, an on-air
meteorologist at The Weather Channel, joked to me.
</p>
<p>
But as Cappucci alluded to, there is also an elevated sense of
responsibility. Every local weather website in or near the path of
totality I checked last week already had information about the
eclipse-day forecast on its homepage. National publications like <em>The
Washington Post</em>, meanwhile, are publishing new
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/01/02/total-solar-eclipse-path-april/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explainers</a>,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/03/29/cloud-cover-eclipse-forecast-maps-cities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live
maps</a>, and
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/03/31/total-solar-eclipse-america/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opinion
pieces</a> daily in the lead-up to the event. Wilson told me The Weather
Channel will have “a bunch of teams” stationed from Texas all the way
along the path of totality to Maine; she’ll personally be on hand in
Dallas for the station’s Celestron telescope
<a href="https://www.astronomy.com/observing/celestron-partners-with-astronomy-for-major-eclipse-event/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">live
stream from Love Field</a>.
</p>
<p>
Cappucci and the rest of the small MyRadar team are also planning to
head to Texas for their coverage, which is shaping up to include
<a href="https://business.myradar.com/eclipse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
live stream</a> and
<a href="https://x.com/MyRadarWX/status/1774624242941739340?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an
“Eclipse Week” package</a> that started Monday. (The company has also
been giving away MyRadar-branded eclipse glasses in the lead-up to the
event.) This time, Cappucci has thought of everything; he even has a
StarLink subscription to ensure that the team can maintain internet
connectivity if it ends up reporting from a remote corner of the state.
</p>
<p>
Fox Weather, meanwhile, has 120 meteorologists under its national,
regional, and local umbrella, and has been planning
<a href="https://www.foxweather.com/live" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its
own solar eclipse package</a> since October’s
<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2023/9/28/the-science-of-solar-eclipses-and-how-to-watch-with-nasa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annular
eclipse</a> over Texas. The finer details were still coming together
last week when I spoke to Fox meteorologist Stephen Morgan, who is based
in New York City and will be anchoring from Dallas. But at a minimum,
the network plans to have correspondents on air in 10 cities along the
path of totality, stretching from Eagle Pass on the Mexican border to
Burlington, Vermont. “We’re excited,” Morgan told me, “but I think the
elephant in the room is the fact that this is happening in the month of
April, which is a very tough month when it comes to forecasting.”
</p>
<p>
Joe Rao, a longtime television meteorologist and an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_chasing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">umbraphile</a>
who has seen 13 total solar eclipses, was even more blunt when I asked
him what local weather teams would be grappling with this week. “Out of
the 12 months of the year, April is probably the worst month to have an
eclipse,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
April is a transitional month in North America, seasonally-speaking. It
is a time when severe weather begins to ramp up; it’s
<a href="https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/april-begins-severe-weather-threat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
second busiest</a> month for tornadoes. The continent’s
<a href="https://eclipsophile.com/2024tse/#:~:text=April%E2%80%99s%20major%20storm%20tracks%20across%20the%20continent" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">three
major west-to-east storm paths</a> also become more active. And in
places like Texas, which experts said would have
<a href="https://eclipsophile.com/2024tse/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the
best chance of anywhere in the nation</a> for clear skies on eclipse
day, you can still get a south wind that brings moisture off the Gulf of
Mexico, giving clouds a chance to develop.
</p>
<p>
Houston-based Fox meteorologist Aaron Barker is keenly aware of this.
He’s been sharing radar models for Central Texas
<a href="https://x.com/weatherbarker/status/1775191926599192691?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">on
Twitter</a> and, as of now, the region is looking pretty dicey for cloud
cover next week. Like Morgan and Cappucci, though, he said the pressure
to get this particular forecast right is intense. “It’s obviously less
serious than a hurricane or something like that, but the importance of
the forecast for a lot of people is still very, very high,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
Ironically, that’s also part of the problem; because of the danger of
storms like hurricanes and tornadoes, we’ve gotten pretty good at seeing
them coming. “The science has improved remarkably over the years trying
to hone in on those threats, but cloud cover — my word. That’s a tough
one,” Morgan said. Clouds alone aren’t usually a life or death
situation. But for people spending hundreds or thousands of dollars to
chase a rare celestial phenomenon, the stakes can start to <em>feel</em>
that high.
</p>
<p>
Cappucci gets it: “I’ve done a million kajillion tornadoes, hurricanes,
the Northern Lights, the whole nine yards,” he said. “Simply nothing
compares to a total solar eclipse.” As he explained, the “most important
thing” you can see during an eclipse is the corona — the silvery
atmosphere of the sun visible around the moon that “looks like the hairs
of an angel because they’re glowing and radiating out into space.” To
see it, though, you need clear skies. “Even some high cirrus clouds —
yeah, they’re a nuisance, but you can still see some stuff,” Cappucci
went on. “But to get overcast rain is really a showstopper.”
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, that’s precisely what Barker has been seeing on his radar
models for most of Texas, and local meteorology teams in Dallas,
Oklahoma, and Arkansas have begun to dampen expectations. Wilson, the
Weather Channel meteorologist, admitted that she’s a little “nervous”
while cautioning that it’s still early for such predictions. Meanwhile,
upstate New York and Vermont, which have the worst records of clear
skies this time of year, are shaping up to have the best show in the
country.
</p>
<p>
Rao, the longtime eclipse-chaser, has only been clouded out at two of
his 13 experiences. (If you believe in luck, note that he plans to watch
this one somewhere upstate.) He has
<a href="https://www.space.com/what-if-it-is-cloudy-for-total-solar-eclipse-april-8-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tried
to calm some of the panic</a> around the possibility of cloud cover,
explaining to me that “it’s not like you’re not going to experience
anything” if the sky is overcast on April 8. During one of his
cloud-outs, at his first eclipse in Quebec in 1972, he watched the sky
go from “battleship gray to weird colorations of saffron and pink. At
one point, it was like I was looking at the clouds through the inside of
a beer bottle or an iodine bottle.”
</p>
<p>
Of course, pretty clouds are just consolation; everyone wants perfect
viewing conditions. The National Weather Service has even started to
post
<a href="https://x.com/NWSWPC/status/1774862804463538444?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a
little jingle</a> alongside its daily cloud-cover updates: “Totality or
bust, check the forecast and adjust!” The meteorologists I spoke to
universally agreed that they won’t start to put too much stock in the
cloud models until Wednesday or Thursday at the earliest.
</p>
<p>
Wilson said she personally won’t feel confident in the hourly models
until at least three or four days out, and even then, you never really
know. It was overcast when she was covering the annular eclipse in San
Antonio in October and “everybody was kind of freaking out. Then, about
20 minutes before eclipse time, it cleared out.”
</p>
<p>
That is the annoying truth of modern meteorology: Not even the best
computers, radars,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/old-farmers-almanac-climate-change" target="_self">almanacs</a>,
or atmospheric scientists can predict whether a stray cloud will wander
in front of the sun in the minutes before totality.
</p>
<p>
“I’m just really hoping that April doesn’t do April things and that
weather-wise, it cooperates,” Morgan said. “But April is full of
surprises — and clouds.”

<h1 id="2024-04-01-what-s-the-plan">
2024-04-01 What’s the plan?
</h1>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Shufei">@Shufei</span></a> asks what we’ll
do with all the billionaires if we survive the next decade, the next
century. Like I said in that post about Israel and Palestine, it’s worth
imagining positive outcomes and then think about the intermediate steps.
So, assuming we make it, what happened?
</p>
<p>
I think the long term change we would need is
<a href="2024-04-03-tax">extremely high taxes</a> as a an explicit
redistribution mechanism. We’ll look back and say, “during Late State
Capitalism we nearly ended the planet but then we manage to curb
inequality and raised inheritance tax to 80%, the max income tax bracket
to 90% and the two-digit million wealth tax to 20%.”
</p>
<p>
The goal would be a society with salaries between 50k and 200k per year
and family, and wealth worth one year of salary. Health insurance paid
for by taxes. Retirement homes paid for by taxes. Pensions paid for by
immediate redistribution (i.e., taxes) instead of investments.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://mastodon.sdf.org/@Shufei" title="@Shufei@mastodon.sdf.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Shufei">@Shufei</span></a> commented on
this and mentioned land reform:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Rentierism in all facets has virtually no restraints in most of the
world. That is sometimes <sup>2</sup>⁄<sub>3</sub> of capital which a
family could have put to family resiliency, instead going to landlords
and investment epiphenomina like gentrification. I’m not sure oldschool
petite bourgeois distributionism (landed yeomanry) is the big answer
there, but under a “permanent jubilee” it might be workable enough to
eliminate the scourge of landlordism.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m not quite sure what the plan is, though.
</p>
<p>
For urban planning it seems to be state-sponsored coop housing. As soon
as the percentage of sponsored housing goes up, the other rents go down,
while still leaving the option of more generous housing being built.
This is a lesson that was somewhat forgotten in Zürich for a few decades
and that seems to explain a lot about the high rents, here.
</p>
<p>
For agriculture, what seems to have worked in Switzerland (still not
enough but a lot better than in the European Union) is protectionism,
direct payment, zoning laws, government fixed pricing on agricultural
land, etc. not a single thing but a whole set of interlocking
mechanisms. And there is still room for improvement. But I’d defer to
groups active in food sovereignty to better answer that question, I
guess. Maybe <a href="https://viacampesina.org/">Via Campesina</a> has a
plan, for example.
</p>
<p>
<a class="account" href="https://idiomdrottning.org/users/Sandra" title="@Sandra@idiomdrottning.org"><span
class="citation" data-cites="Sandra">@Sandra</span></a> just posted two
links, one discussing alternatives and one where she looks for the
elements of the solution. Let’s talk about them.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/alternatives">Alternatives</a>
argues for market socialism, as I read it. In a subsequent comment on
fedi she disagreed with this take and said that it was by far the
weakest alternative. But I’m not so sure. Planned economy doesn’t work;
small nudges is what we have and it doesn’t seem to be working either;
and the last option seems to be “utopias and sundry”. That doesn’t sound
promising, either. I still think that in the given list, market
socialism doesn’t sound bad at all.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Worker-owned cooperatives that trade with each other on a market. That’s
it. That’s the whole plan.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Then again, none of the alternatives seem pretty strong.
</p>
<p>
I’m also not sure how market socialism would work in a global
environment. How would we deal with local bad harvests and war? It’s
biggest benefit seems to be that it promises incremental improvements.
No bloody revolution necessary. And that’s already a plus.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A big upside of this track is that it’s somewhat compatible with the
other systems and with present-day market capitalism. This means that it
can be implemented piecemeal wherever it make sense and I think that’s
awesome.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a href="https://idiomdrottning.org/solution">My best guess at a climate
solution</a> is where Sandra ends with a call to regain influence in the
media.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Making changes in our own lives is great (eat plants) but ideally we’d
want politicians (and their overlords: mass media) to sober up and
implement policies to steer industry and the rich.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Here in Switzerland (and elsewhere), the fascists like to complain about
left-wing media and fight them and defund them until they have them
under their thumb (remember Berlusconi’s media take-over in Italy). So
we need to fight them all the way: Decry their meddling and scheming and
increase the funding. Demand that they drop the airhead programming and
bring back material that helps lift people up, not drag them down.
Education and information is key.
</p>
<p>
I’m not a media person, so I don’t know how to do it. All I can say is
that music programs that have interesting discussions surrounding the
music work well for me. Podcasts work for me. Series seem to work for
some. Just drop the quiz shows and reality-TV and all that order
material that only serves to distract.
</p>
<p>
I guess that in my heart of hearts I feel that humanity’s main problem
is sociopaths. These people are always there and they love their person
gain and don’t feel other people’s pain. Therefore, the struggle is
eternal. There is no solidification, no solution that will hold for
generations. Every generation will have to fight this fight. All I can
say is that it’s a mistake to let a generation grow up in the belief
that politics is not important, that struggle isn’t necessary, or that
the end of history has come.
</p>
<p>
That is never going to be true.

<h1 id="2024-04-03-we-need-more-taxes">
2024-04-03 We need more taxes
</h1>
<p>
I recently wondered about <a href="2024-04-01-the-plan">our plan</a> for
dealing with the rich. A key part is increased taxation.
</p>
<p>
Whenever I hear talk about the state crumbling (and since my wife works
for the federal government in Switzerland I hear plenty of that), the
first thing many people think is that the fault lies with the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget_amendment">balanced
budget amendment</a> (“Schuldenbremse”). And indeed, that is the obvious
cause for many of the problems.
</p>
<p>
Arguing about the balanced budget amendment is doomed, however. Most
people don’t understand the difference between household economics and
state economics. A much simpler solution exists, one that everybody
understands: <strong>INCREASE TAXES FFS!</strong>
</p>
<p>
Now I know why countries like Switzerland don’t like to increase taxes:
Where would all the oligarchs go? Where would all the great holdings go?
And within Switzerland, same thing: as soon as one canton dropped
inheritance tax they all feared that the rich would move elsewhere and
started dropping their inheritance taxes. And now
<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erbschaftssteuer_in_der_Schweiz">there
is practically none</a>, for descendants. Wealth can stay in the family,
like in the good old days of feudalism.

Next up: Fighting tax evasion, fighting the free movement of capital,
fighting for a global tax (do not follow the Swiss model of malevolent
compliance!), and more. The fighting just never stops, I know. 😩
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax">Progressive
taxation</a> is great. The more you own and make, the more you can
afford to support the public good. Pay proportionally more!
</p>
<p>
Taxes are great for redistribution of wealth. We don’t need to argue
about Universal Basic Income (I support it!) or new subsidies or
anything else like that: We can simply use existing mechanisms to
redistribute wealth, reducing that Gini coefficient, increasing
happiness, increasing the feeling of living in a fair and just society,
increasing the feeling that work can get you to the top.
</p>
<p>
Taxes are great to fight inflation, too! If the state hands out more
money in a time of crisis, that excess money has to be taken back via
taxes. This keeps the money flowing (and only money flowing is what
counts). Of course you don’t want to bring it back via asocial taxation
schemes like a fixed per-head tax, or a VAT, but something like
progressive income tax or progressive wealth tax.
</p>
<p>
This makes sense, even in broken system like ours: COVID money for
everybody, everybody is squeezed by landlords and industry, then tax the
rich to get the money back. Virtuous cycle!

foreign ministers to discuss proposed military fund for Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STATE DEPARTMENT — NATO foreign ministers meeting Wednesday in
Brussels are expected to discuss a proposal to create a $100 billion
fund for supporting Ukraine’s military.</p>
<p>The plan, put forward by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg,
also includes making NATO more directly involved in coordinating
military assistance being provided by member countries, a role that has
been filled by a U.S.-led coalition of more than 50 countries.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg told reporters Wednesday it is important that support for
Ukraine be less dependent on voluntary, short-term offers and more
dependent on longer-term NATO commitments.  He said Ukrainian commanders
would be better able to make battlefield plans with more predictable
support.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg said the plan would also send a message to Russia that it
cannot win by keeping the war going long enough that Ukraine’s allies
tire of providing support.</p>
<p>“Ukraine has urgent needs,” Stoltenberg said.  “Any delay in
providing support has consequences on the battlefield as we speak.”</p>
<p>A final decision on the proposal would not come until NATO heads of
state meet at a summit in July.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Brussels talks, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken
renewed calls for the U.S. Congress to release military aid for
Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We are at a critical moment where it is absolutely essential to get
Ukrainians what they continue to need to defend themselves, particularly
when it comes to munitions and air defenses,” Blinken said Tuesday
during a visit to a defense facility in Paris with French Defense
Minister Sébastien Lecornu.</p>
<p>Congress is yet to approve the Biden administration’s supplementary
budget request that would provide aid to resupply Ukraine’s armed forces
and help the country fend off Russian offensives.</p>
<p>Biden has called on the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives
to approve the military and financial aid package. House Republicans
have delayed action on it for months, prioritizing domestic issues.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Ukrainian
forces will have to retreat “step by step, in small steps,” if Kyiv
doesn’t receive the U.S. military aid.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Séjourné was in Beijing earlier this week. He
said after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that France
expects China to convey “clear messages” to its close partner Russia
regarding Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.</p>
<p>France and China have sought to strengthen ties in recent years.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is planning a visit to France in May.</p>
<p>During meetings in Paris in February, Wang told French President
Macron that Beijing appreciated his country’s “independent” stance. But
Paris has also sought to press Beijing on its close ties with Moscow,
which have only grown closer since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>U.S. and French officials said they are working closely to
effectively prevent the transfer of weapons and materials to Russia from
North Korea and China, which could fuel Moscow’s defense industrial
base.</p>

id="exiled-chinese-businessman-guo-wengui-must-face-us-fraud-indictment">Exiled
Chinese businessman Guo Wengui must face US fraud indictment</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new york — A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected exiled Chinese
businessman Guo Wengui’s bid to dismiss an indictment accusing him of
defrauding thousands of investors out of more than $1 billion. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said prosecutors
sufficiently alleged that Guo engaged in a pattern of racketeering
through four fraud schemes, and that proving it was a matter for
trial. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Guo did not immediately respond to requests for comment
after business hours. </p>
<p>Guo has pleaded not guilty to 12 criminal charges including
securities fraud, wire fraud, unlawful monetary transactions and
conspiracy, including for money laundering. </p>
<p>According to the indictment, Guo and his accomplices defrauded
investors in a media company, cryptocurrency and other ventures. </p>
<p>The indictment said Guo took advantage of his prolific online
presence and hundreds of thousands of followers by promising outsized
financial returns and other benefits. </p>
<p>In reality, the scheme allowed the co-conspirators to enrich
themselves and family members and fund Guo’s “extravagant lifestyle,”
the indictment said. </p>
<p>Two co-defendants face related criminal charges, and one defendant is
charged with obstruction. </p>
<p>Also known as Ho Wan Kwok and Miles Kwok, Guo is a critic of China’s
Communist Party and a business associate of former U.S. President Donald
Trump’s onetime adviser Steve Bannon. </p>
<p>Guo has been jailed in Brooklyn, a borough in New York City, since
his March 2023 arrest, with Torres and a federal appeals court rejecting
his proposed $25 million bail package last year. </p>
<p>Jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin on May 20. </p>
<p>Prosecutors also sought the forfeiture of various assets, including
bank accounts, a $37 million yacht, a New Jersey mansion, a Bugatti, a
Lamborghini and a Rolls Royce. </p>
<p>Guo filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Connecticut in
February 2022. That case was later combined with the bankruptcies of
other companies he controlled. Torres has twice rejected Guo’s bid to
stay the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

id="service-provider-for-immigrants-in-detention-ordered-to-pay-811m-in-lawsuit">Service
provider for immigrants in detention ordered to pay $811M+ in
lawsuit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-03, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — A company that provides services for immigrants in federal
detention was ordered Tuesday to pay more than $811 million in
restitution and penalties in a lawsuit alleging it used deceptive and
abusive tactics.</p>
<p>Nexus Services must pay roughly $231 million in restitution as well
as penalties of $13.8 million to New York, $7.1 million to Virginia and
$3.4 million to Massachusetts, according to a judgment filed in federal
court for the Western District of Virginia in Harrisonburg. The
Virginia-based company, its subsidiary Libre by Nexus and its three
executives must also each pay more than $111 million in civil
penalties.</p>
<p>“This judgment is a victory for thousands of immigrant families who
lost their life savings and were targeted and preyed on by Libre,” New
York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “Libre
exploited vulnerable immigrants and their families to pad its pockets,
and that is illegal and unconscionable.”</p>
<p>James joined state attorneys general in Virginia and Massachusetts
and the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2021 lawsuit
that accused the company of violating state and federal consumer
protection laws.</p>
<p>The officials said the company promised to secure immigrants’ release
on bond while their immigration claims were being processed but
concealed and misrepresented the true nature and costs of its services.
They said the company collected thousands of dollars in fees above the
face value of the bonds and forced immigrants to wear painful ankle
monitors.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Dillon noted in her decision that the
company isn’t a licensed bail bond agent or a surety company certified
by the U.S. Treasury but a “service provider that acts as an
intermediary between immigration detainees and sureties and their bond

<p>The company said in a statement that it intends to appeal the
judgment, calling it a “shocking departure from normal American
jurisprudence” as it was decided “without evidence, without a trial and
without a damages hearing.”</p>
<p>“We continue to remain committed to serving our clients — people who
suffer and sacrifice for a better life, and who do not deserve to be
political pawns in an American legislature or an American courtroom,”
the company added.</p>

starting to test the blogroll software with a few users, but we hit a
problem before we began. The blogroll code includes the CSS for the
Bootstrap Toolkit. I use it as if it were part of the OS, but not
everyone does, and it changes the global values of things. So when you
install it on a page that has its own ideas how things should work, you
can get an unpleasant effect (to put it mildly). So I created a
localized
<a href="http://scripting.com/code/blogroll/smallbootstrap.css">subset</a>
of Bootstrap’s styles, to be a better guest in other people’s pages.
That is now done. I expect we’ll see more of that kind of thing. Web
plugins are a new area for me. I guess that’s pretty obvious.

<h2 id="us-japan-eye-alliance-upgrades-during-biden-kishida-meeting">US,
Japan eye alliance upgrades during Biden-Kishida meeting</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>seoul, south korea — The United States and Japan are considering ways
to strengthen military cooperation, with several reports suggesting the
alliance could see one of its biggest structural upgrades in several
decades. </p>
<p>The potential changes, meant to better address shared threats such as
China and North Korea, will figure prominently when Japanese Prime
Minister Fumio Kishida meets U.S. President Joe Biden during a state
visit next week in Washington.  </p>
<p>During the visit, U.S. and Japanese officials are expected to agree
on a review of the framework that has for decades guided interaction
between Japan’s Self-Defense Forces and the approximately 54,000 U.S.
troops in Japan.  </p>
<p>Specifically, Japan’s Kyodo news agency said, the U.S. military will
consider ways to strengthen the functions of its command headquarters in
Japan amid concerns that the current arrangement would not allow for
adequate coordination during a conflict.  </p>
<p>Japan wants the United States to appoint or elevate a four-star
commander to oversee U.S. troops in the country. Under the current
setup, U.S. Forces Japan is led by a three-star general with little
authority over joint operations. That means Japan must coordinate with
the U.S. military’s Indo-Pacific Command, located more than 6,000
kilometers (3,728 miles) and five time zones away in Hawaii.  </p>
<p>The existing arrangement dates to the 1960s, long before China’s
massive military buildup and North Korea’s acquisition of nuclear
weapons upended Asia’s security dynamic, prompting Japan to take a much
more proactive role in world affairs.  </p>
<p>It is not clear what changes the United States will propose. When
asked by VOA about recent reports on the matter, the White House
National Security Council declined to comment. Still, the review is
being welcomed by many in Japan’s defense community who have pushed for
greater integration between the two countries’ forces.  </p>
<p>“This is a very significant step for the alliance,” said Tetsuo
Kotani, senior fellow at the Japan Institute of International Affairs.
“By upgrading our command and control relationship, we are actually
preparing for war fighting together, so that the two militaries can
operate together in a time of crisis.” </p>
<p>More assertive Japan </p>
<p>Until recently, it was difficult to imagine Japan becoming involved
in a major conflict. The country has a technically pacifist
constitution, which was drafted by the U.S. following Tokyo’s defeat in
World War II.  </p>
<p>But in recent years, Japan has loosened some of its self-imposed
military restraints, allowing it to become a major player in regional
and global security.  </p>
<p>Most notably, Japan intends to increase its annual defense spending
to 2% of its gross domestic product (GDP), up from the traditional 1%,
by 2027. This will likely give Japan the world’s third-largest military
budget, behind the United States and China.  </p>
<p>For the first time, Japan also will deploy missiles that can hit
military targets in other countries. In January, Japan signed a deal
with the U.S. to purchase up to 400 Tomahawk cruise missiles. </p>
<p>The acquisition has created further urgency for military integration,
according to analysts, who note that Japan would rely on the United
States for targeting information, damage assessment and escalation
management if the missiles were used.  </p>
<p>Naoko Aoki, an associate political scientist at the RAND Corporation,
said Japan’s increased defense capabilities also necessitate greater
cooperation with South Korea, another U.S. ally, which hosts about
28,500 U.S. troops. </p>
<p>“Because if Japan were to use this [counter strike capability]
against North Korea, for example, then clearly coordination among the
three countries would become very, very important,” she said.  </p>
<p>To allow for smoother integration among its own forces, Japan
recently announced plans to establish a joint operations headquarters by
2025. The move was also widely discussed as a possible catalyst toward
greater integration with U.S. forces.  </p>
<p>How to proceed </p>
<p>The U.S. military has not released details about any possible changes
to its command structure in Japan. However, media reports point to
several possibilities.  </p>
<p>Last week, Reuters reported that Washington will consider appointing
a four-star commander, as Tokyo has requested, though it is not clear
what responsibilities the position would be given. </p>
<p>Some analysts say the appointment of a U.S. four-star general may be
too controversial in Japan, because it would be widely seen as a
possible precursor to the type of unified command that exists in South
Korea, where a U.S. four-star general would control both U.S. and South
Korean troops during wartime. </p>
<p>“A four-star general in Japan sounds like too much at this moment,”
said Kotani. Instead, he thinks the U.S. could establish some type of
joint coordination center to facilitate greater interaction with the
Japanese military.  </p>
<p>A similar idea was mentioned as a possibility last week by the
Financial Times. According to the British newspaper, the task force
would be attached to the Hawaii-based U.S. Pacific Fleet but would shift
to Japan “over time.”  </p>
<p>From Tokyo’s standpoint, such a proposal is “probably better than
nothing,” said Jeffrey J. Hall, a Japanese politics specialist at Kanda
University of International Studies.  </p>
<p>“It does make sense to have decision-making power shifted to a time
zone closer to a potential conflict area,” Hall said.  </p>
<p>But, Hall said, U.S. officials are likely to proceed cautiously,
perhaps wary of big steps that could spark domestic opposition in Japan,
where some are uncomfortable with the idea of Japanese troops being
controlled by the United States.  </p>
<p>Kishida is already in a difficult situation at home. The approval
rating of his Cabinet remains near record lows amid long-running
economic challenges and a political fundraising scandal in his party.
 </p>
<p>“For the last year, we’ve been in a situation where Prime Minister
Kishida is incredibly unpopular among Japanese voters but loved by the
national security folks in Washington,” Hall said.  </p>
<p>For Japan, the question is how to achieve greater military
integration while maintaining proper levels of independence, given
Japan’s constitutional and political restraints, said Aoki. But she
maintains that the effort is worthwhile. </p>
<p>“The command and control architecture … hasn’t been changed since the
1960s, but the threat environment has changed greatly,” she said. “So,
modernizing this will help the credibility of the alliance and help
deterrence in the region.”</p>

<h2 id="biden-hosts-scaled-down-ramadan-events-amid-gaza-outrage">Biden
hosts scaled-down Ramadan events amid Gaza outrage</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — President Joe Biden is meeting with American Muslim
community leaders on Tuesday amid outrage from Muslim and Arab Americans
over his administration’s support for Israel’s war against Hamas in
Gaza.</p>
<p>“Continuing his tradition of honoring the Muslim community during
Ramadan, President Biden will host a meeting with Muslim community
leaders to discuss issues of importance to the community,” a White House
official said in a statement sent to VOA.</p>
<p>“He will be joined by Vice President [Kamala] Harris, senior Muslim
Administration officials and senior members of his National Security
team.”</p>
<p>Following the meeting, the official said they will “host a small
breaking of the fast, prayer, and Iftar” with “a number” of senior
Muslim administration officials.</p>
<p>Unlike in previous years, American Muslim leaders were not included
in the White House iftar, or breaking of the fast meal. White House
press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the leaders had declined
and asked for a “working group meeting” instead.</p>
<p>“They wanted to make sure that there was an opportunity to discuss
the issues at hand,” she said during her briefing Tuesday in response to
a VOA question. “We listened, we heard, and we adjusted the format to be
responsive so that we can get feedback from them.”</p>
<p>Since taking office, Biden has hosted Muslim community leaders at the
White House, a tradition that began with President Bill Clinton in 1996.
Except for President Donald Trump in 2017, Republican and Democratic
presidents have hosted an iftar dinner during Ramadan or an Eid al-Fitr
reception to mark the end of the month of fasting.</p>
<p>Past Ramadan and Eid celebrations usually included diplomats from
majority-Muslim countries. Embassies that VOA reached out to said they
have not received an invitation this year.</p>
<p>Many decline invitation</p>
<p>Even with the meeting-only format, many community leaders declined to
attend, and Biden will likely meet with only a handful of them.</p>
<p>In a social media post, Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action said they
had asked Biden to “postpone this gathering and to convene a proper
policy meeting with representatives of the community’s choosing rather
than those selected by the White House.”</p>
<p>The administration “can and should leverage its enormous support for
Israel and begin to take demonstrable actions” including to demand an
immediate and permanent cease-fire and unfettered access for
humanitarian aid,” the group said.</p>
<p>“Without more Palestinian voices and policy experts in the room, we
do not believe today’s meeting will provide for such an
opportunity.”</p>
<p>Many who have attended White House Ramadan events in the past said
they had no idea about the meeting until VOA reached out to them.</p>
<p>“It’s probably hand-picked people who have been vetted and who have
been guaranteed not to speak up and be critical of the president’s
policies,” said Jawaid Kotwal, board member of the Afghan American
Foundation.</p>
<p>Several White House and Biden campaign events around the country have
been marred with disruptions by pro-Palestinian protesters. His
constituents — including many Muslim and Arab Americans — have signaled
their outrage. Hundreds of thousands voted “uncommitted” in Democratic
primary elections in various states.</p>
<p>A Pew survey released Tuesday shows that only 36% of American Muslims
view Biden positively. The same survey shows that only 6% believe the
U.S. is striking the right balance between the Israelis and
Palestinians. Sixty percent say Biden favors the Israelis too much.</p>
<p>‘A time of mourning, not celebration’</p>
<p>“The American Muslim community has made it very clear they have no
interest in breaking bread with President Biden while his administration
is enabling the starvation and slaughter of Palestinians in Gaza,”
Edward Ahmed Mitchell told VOA. Mitchell is deputy executive director of
the Council on American-Islamic Relations, also known as CAIR.</p>
<p>As the death toll in Gaza approaches 33,000 people, it’s clear that
many American Muslims are uncomfortable with the thought of celebrating
at the White House.</p>
<p>“This is a time of mourning, not celebration, so we’re only accepting
iftars that benefit the poor, refugees and the oppressed,” Salam
Al-Marayati, founder of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told VOA.</p>
<p>CAIR and other Muslim groups and anti-war organizations are hosting a
“People’s White House Ceasefire Now Iftar” in front of the White House
on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Biden also faces dissent from some administration staff members,
particularly those with Arab or Muslim backgrounds, including Tariq
Habash, a Palestinian American and former policy adviser at the
Department of Education who resigned in protest in January.</p>
<p>The president is “attempting to break bread with Muslim staffers
while finalizing the sale of billions of dollars in warplanes to Israel
as its extremist government targets humanitarian workers and hospitals,”
Habash told VOA.</p>
<p>Biden’s meeting with American Muslims came amid reports that seven
aid workers, including at least one dual-nationality American from the
NGO World Central Kitchen, were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza
on Monday.</p>
<p>The organization, led by celebrity chef Jose Andres, has been leading
the efforts to get food to Gaza via a ship from Cyprus.</p>
<p>Iuliia Iarmolenko, Sayed Aziz Rahman, Yuni Salim and Iram Abbasi
contributed to this report.</p>

id="microsoft-announces-prices-for-the-windows-10-extended-security-update-program">Microsoft
announces prices for the Windows 10 Extended Security Update
program</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Windows 10 is reaching end of support on October 14, 2025, so if
you’re still using Windows 10 – and let’s face it, if you’re somehow
forced to still use Windows, better 10 than 11 – your time is running
out. Luckily, end of support is a bit of a nebulous term when it comes
to Microsoft products, and many among you, especially those managing
larger fleets of systems, will know Microsoft offers something called
the Extended Security Update (ESU) program, wherein you get additional
security updates even after end of support. Microsoft just unveiled the
prices for this program for Windows 10. While there’s several schemes,
the one most of you will be interested in is this one: With the 5-by-5
activation method, you’ll download an activation key and apply it to
individual Windows 10 devices that you’ve selected for your ESU program.
Manage it via scripting or the Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT),
among other methods. You can use on-premises management tools such as
Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) with Configuration Manager to
download and apply the updates to your Windows 10 devices. The 5-by-5
activation subscription will establish the Year One list price of ESU
for Windows 10. This is the base license and will cost $61 USD per
device for Year 1, similar to the Windows 7 ESU Year 1 price. ↫ Jason
Leznek Honestly, that’s not an egregious price, but do note that this
price doubles every year for three years total, and note that if you
want to start using ESU in year two, you’ll have to pay for year one as
well. In other words, pricing ramps up fast. Furthermore, this program
only includes security updates – no new features or anything like that,
and it doesn’t include support either. So, if you’re still using Windows
10 after October 14, 2025, you’ll either have to pay up, have an
insecure system, downgrade to Windows 11, or move to a better
alternative. Choice’s yours.</p>

<h2 id="discord-turns-to-ads">Discord turns to ads</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Quests are a way for players to discover games and earn rewards for
playing them on Discord. We started experimenting with them over the
last year, and millions of you opted in and completed them. We’ve heard
great feedback from developers who partnered with us to create them and
from many of you who completed one. If you didn’t see firsthand, the
“May the 4th” Fortnite Quest is a great example. Now, we’re opening up
sponsored Quests to more game developers. ↫ Peter Sellis That’s a lot of
fancy, hip words to say Discord is going to show you ads. I have an odd
relationship with Discord – it holds a special place in my heart because
through Discord is how I met my now-wife and mother of our children, so
understandably, the chat platform has a special meaning for us. At the
same time, though, Discord has been getting steadily worse and less
usable over the years, and while my wife isn’t too bothered by that, I
certainly am – and so we moved our instant messaging over to Signal
instead. My wife still uses Discord with her friends. Seeing a platform
that used to be quite usable, and easily the best way to manage a group
of geographically spread-out friends, fall prey to the same kind of
bullshit so many other platforms have succumbed to. Discord today is
almost unrecognisable to what it was like 6-7 years ago, and now there’s
even going to be ads – the final nail in the coffin for the possibility
of me ever going back to using it.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The electric vehicle market is anyone’s game.
</p>
<p>
That’s the takeaway from this year’s first tranche of EV sales data,
which saw the two global market leaders — Tesla and BYD — turn in dismal
sales for the first three months of the year. Those were in contrast to
other automakers including Rivian, Hyundai, and Toyota, all of which
reported healthier numbers.
</p>
<p>
Tesla’s deliveries, which Wall Street uses as a decent proxy for sales,
came up well short of analysts’ expectations at
<a href="https://ir.tesla.com/tesla-vehicle-production-deliveries-and-date-financial-results-webcast-first-quarter-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">386,810
vehicles</a> for the quarter —
<a href="https://twitter.com/CoreyBCantor/status/1775154525235487040?s=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">down
about 9%</a> from the first quarter of 2023. Analysts have
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/03/28/tesla-tsla-delivery-estimates-all-over-the-place/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">consistently
cut their estimates</a> for this quarter’s deliveries over the past few
weeks, but even so, the real numbers came in well below even the
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lowest
expectations</a>.
</p>
<p>
“I was a little bit bearish on Tesla for this quarter — and I should’ve
been darker,” Corey Cantor, an EV analyst for BloombergNEF, a new-energy
research firm, told me.
</p>
<p>
But despite those meager results, Tesla edged out BYD on sales for the
quarter. The Chinese EV giant — whose new
<a href="https://www.theautopian.com/byd-seagull-ev/)." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$9,000
Seagull hatchback</a> has
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self">stunned</a>
Western automakers and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_self">triggered
protectionist impulses</a> around the world — reported far less stunning
sales data. BYD
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4f1a2188-ced0-4018-998d-5148209a5f5e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sold
300,114</a> vehicles in the first three months of 2024, down 42%
compared to a year before.
</p>
<p>
That means Tesla is once again the world’s No. 1 seller of electric
vehicles, after ceding that title to BYD last year. But little else is
going right for Elon Musk’s car company.
</p>
<p>
Tesla has an aging vehicle line-up, and its newest North American
offering, the Cybertruck, has
<a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2024-tesla-cybertruck-review" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not
impressed</a> reviewers. By its own admission, the company is struggling
to scale up the Cybertruck’s production as well.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most worrying for Musk is that Tesla produced almost 47,000 more
vehicles during the first quarter than it sold, suggesting that it is
beginning to hit real limits on customer demand for its cars.
</p>
<p>
“There must be some kind of supply-demand imbalance here,” Cantor said.
Tesla has
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-temporarily-slashes-prices-model-y-us-2024-02-10/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">slashed</a>
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/02/business/tesla-fourth-quarter-sales.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">its
vehicle prices</a> by thousands of dollars over the past year in order
to stimulate demand. Tesla doesn’t break out its sales data by region,
which is a shame because that could help clarify what is going on. If
Tesla’s sales are flagging in China and Europe, that could be because
consumers are flocking to a new set of EV options. A sales decline in
the U.S. would indicate that one of the company’s cash cows, the Model Y
crossover, is beginning to falter.
</p>
<p>
“If you look at this, you can see where there are yellow flags here,”
Cantor said. “Tesla can explain it however you want but the numbers
speak for themselves. Anytime you’re down 9% year on year is a
challenge.”
</p>
<p>
It’s harder to know how to read BYD’s fillip. Other Chinese automakers
<a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3257483/chinese-carmakers-li-auto-nio-xpeng-and-byd-report-march-sales-rebound-difficulties-are-looming" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>
surging March sales. Xiaomi, a Chinese phone maker, has
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68705711" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported
almost 90,000 preorders</a> for its first-ever electric car, the SU7.
Cantor speculated that the hiccup may be due to Lunar New Year, which
tends to depress sales in January and February.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the car market, other EV makers did better — although few
reported surging sales. One exception was Hyundai, which reported EV
sales up
<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-motor-america-reports-all-time-record-march-and-q1-2024-sales-302105571.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">more
than 60%</a> from the first quarter of 2023.
</p>
<p>
General Motors’ electric vehicle sales
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-new-vehicle-sales-likely-rose-q1-extend-recent-streak-2024-04-02/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fell
20.5%</a> compared to the first quarter of 2023, even as the company’s
overall sales of personal-use vehicles rose slightly. It reported higher
sales for the Lyriq, its EV SUV, Cantor said.
</p>
<p>
Toyota says that it sold 206,850 “electrified” cars across North America
in the first quarter, a gain of 74% over the year before. “Electrified,”
however, is a
<a href="https://www.toyota.com/electrified-vehicles/" target="_blank">Toyota
term of art</a> — it includes conventional hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and
hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. About a third of Toyota’s North American
sales now fall in this category.
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The electric truck maker Rivian modestly surpassed
expectations, beating both analysts’ and its own estimates with
<a href="https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-releases-q1-2024-production-figures" target="_blank">13,588
deliveries</a> in the first few months of 2024. While its total
production of 13,980 vehicles for the quarter came in
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/rivian-misses-production-estimates-ev-maker-shifts-new-supply-chain-2024-04-02/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">marginally
below predictions</a>, Rivian reaffirmed its earlier estimates for
full-year production.
</p>
<p>
Even so, by late afternoon, Rivian’s stock was down 5% for the day. That
might be partially explained by the
<a href="https://riviantrackr.com/news/rivian-factory-shut-down-q2-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">planned
weeks-long</a> shutdown of its factory in Normal, Illinois, scheduled to
begin at the end of this week. While the pause will allow for
renovations designed to reduce costs and increase efficiency, it will
also mean that next quarter is guaranteed to be a “wash” for Rivian,
Cantor said.
</p>
<p>
As of last quarter, Rivian was
<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/02/21/rivians-gross-margins-slip-q4-2023-but-more-to-it/" target="_blank">losing
about $43,000</a> on every vehicle it produced. Whether it can stem
those losses and get on the
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-earnings-r2-release" target="_self">bridge
to profitability</a>” executives say is within sight remains,
apparently, an open question for shareholders. Rivian is now focused on
surviving long enough to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-suv-r2-r3-r3x" target="_self">sell
the R2 SUV</a>. “Every single thing we do within the business is focused
on driving costs on this,” RJ Scaringe, Rivian’s CEO, told CNBC last
month.
</p>
<p>
Tesla’s and BYD’s flagging sales may also be signaling to investors that
a general EV slowdown is coming. And then, of course, there’s the
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/ev-electric-vehicle-slowdown-ford-gm-tesla-b20a748e" target="_blank">general
malaise</a> that descended over the EV industry in 2023 as the big
legacy American automakers reported sluggish sales for their splashy new
electric models and planned to scale back production in the coming year.
Though the data don’t present as clear a picture as the doomers might
suggest, it is undeniable that, as Princeton energy systems professor
and Shift Key podcast co-host Jesse Jenkins wrote for Heatmap,
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/are-ev-sales-really-slowing-data" target="_self">the
vibes are bad</a>.”
</p>
<p>
“The narrative now will be harsh on Tesla and BYD,” Cantor said. “But if
you’re another automaker, you should see this as an opportunity. We’re
in the early stages here. None of this is written.”

license change and forking are a mess that everybody can feel bad
about</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Redis, a tremendously popular tool for storing data in-memory rather
than in a database, recently switched its licensing from an open source
BSD license to both a Source Available License and a Server Side Public
License (SSPL). The software project and company supporting it were
fairly clear in why they did this. Redis CEO Rowan Trollope wrote on
March 20 that while Redis and volunteers sponsored the bulk of the
project’s code development, “the majority of Redis’ commercial sales are
channeled through the largest cloud service providers, who commoditize
Redis’ investments and its open source community.” Clarifying a bit,
“cloud service providers hosting Redis offerings will no longer be
permitted to use the source code of Redis free of charge.” This
generated a lot of discussion, blowback, and action. The biggest thing
was a fork of the Redis project, Valkey, that is backed by The Linux
Foundation and, critically, also Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud,
Oracle, Ericsson, and Snap Inc. Valkey is “fully open source,” Linux
Foundation execs note, with the kind of BSD-3-Clause license Redis
sported until recently. You might note the exception of Microsoft from
that list of fork fans. ↫ Kevin Purdy at Ars Technica Moves like this
never go down well.</p>

Carnival: Good enough and the search for perfection</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;There’s a specific type of beauty that can only be found in the most perfect of creations. Pure shapes, smooth surfaces. Some objects can only be the result of someone not settling for “good enough”.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
There’s also another type of beauty, the one Japanese call
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">wabi-sabi</a>, the
appreciation of things that are imperfect.
</p>
<p>
I don’t see these two things as being opposite to each other, but rather
complementary. Like everything in life, the creation process is an act
of balance.
</p>
<p>
At times I feel trapped between the two. Every day, whether I’m writing,
coding or designing, a part of me strives for perfection while another
is painfully aware that perfection is a mirage. What looks perfect now
won’t look perfect tomorrow. I grow, I evolve, I change and my
definition of perfection evolves with me.
</p>
<p>
This post won’t be perfect but it’s going to be “good enough”. All my
posts are. They have to be. Because a perfect post would never get
posted. Perfection and the real world are like parallel lines in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_geometry">descriptive
geometry </a> whose crossing point can only be found at infinity.
</p>
<p>
It’s why deadlines are important. It’s why constraints are important.
Learning to embrace “good enough” is not easy but it’s a necessary step
if you want to achieve anything.

anti-Muslim incidents hit record high in 2023 due to Israel-Gaza war,
advocacy group says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Reported discrimination and attacks against Muslims and
Palestinians reached a record high in the U.S. in 2023, driven by rising
Islamophobia and bias as the Israel-Gaza war raged late in the year,
data from an advocacy group showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Complaints totaled 8,061 in 2023, a 56% rise from the year before and
the highest since the Council on American-Islamic Relations began
records nearly 30 years ago. About 3,600 of those incidents occurred
from October to December, CAIR said.</p>
<p>Human rights advocates have similarly reported a global rise in
Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian bias and antisemitism since the latest
eruption of conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>U.S. incidents have included the fatal October stabbing of 6-year-old
Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume in Illinois, the November shooting
of three students of Palestinian descent in Vermont and the February
stabbing of a Palestinian man in Texas.</p>
<p>CAIR’s report said 2023 saw a “resurgence of anti-Muslim hate” after
the first ever recorded annual drop in complaints in 2022. In the first
nine months of 2023, such incidents averaged around 500 a month before
jumping to nearly 1,200 a month in the last quarter.</p>
<p>“The primary force behind this wave of heightened Islamophobia was
the escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine in October 2023,” the
report said.</p>
<p>The most numerous complaints in 2023 were in the categories of
immigration and asylum, employment discrimination, hate crimes and
education discrimination, CAIR said.</p>
<p>Palestinian Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing
1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel’s subsequent military
assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed over 32,000 people, according
to the local health ministry, displaced nearly all its 2.3 million
population, put Gaza on the brink of starvation and led to genocide
allegations that Israel denies.</p>
<p>CAIR said it compiled the numbers by reviewing public statements and
videos as well as reports from public calls, emails and an online
complaint system. It contacted people whose incidents were reported in
the media.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-02, updated: 2024-04-02, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
The cybersecurity world got really lucky last week. An intentionally
placed backdoor in xz Utils, an open-source compression utility, was
pretty much
<a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">accidentally
discovered</a> by a Microsoft engineer—weeks before it would have been
incorporated into both Debian and Red Hat Linux. From
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/">ArsTehnica</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the
way the software functions. The backdoor manipulated sshd, the
executable file used to make remote SSH connections. Anyone in
possession of a predetermined encryption key could stash any code of
their choice in an SSH login certificate, upload it, and execute it on
the backdoored device. No one has actually seen code uploaded, so it’s
not known what code the attacker planned to run. In theory, the code
could allow for just about anything, including stealing encryption keys
or installing malware…

id="blinken-urges-swift-impartial-investigation-into-israeli-strike-that-killed-aid-workers-in-gaza">Blinken
urges swift, impartial investigation into Israeli strike that killed aid
workers in Gaza</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>State Department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said
Tuesday that the United States has urged Israel to promptly investigate
an Israeli airstrike in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of seven
humanitarian workers. Blinken reiterated the call for Israel to
prioritize the protection of civilian lives.</p>
<p>“We’ve spoken directly to the Israeli government about this
particular incident. We’ve urged a swift, a thorough and impartial
investigation to understand exactly what happened,” Blinken said Tuesday
during a press conference in Paris.</p>
<p>Humanitarian workers “have to be protected,” Blinken added. “We
shouldn’t have a situation where people who are simply trying to help
their fellow human beings are themselves at grave risk.”</p>
<p>Hours before Blinken’s meeting with French Foreign Minister Stephane
Séjourné, the charity organization World Central Kitchen, founded by
celebrity chef Jose Andres, said that seven of its personnel were killed
in the Israeli airstrike in Gaza. The organization declared an immediate
halt to its operations in the region.</p>
<p>Séjourné expressed strong condemnation of the airstrike during the
joint press conference, saying the situation in Gaza “is disastrous and
is worsening day after day. Nothing justifies such a tragedy.”</p>
<p>Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said his government will
establish a joint situation room with international groups to facilitate
the coordination of aid distribution in Gaza alongside Israeli military
operations.</p>
<p>On Monday, France introduced a draft resolution to the United Nations
Security Council aimed at exploring options for U.N. oversight of a
cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and suggesting ways to help the Palestinian
Authority in taking on responsibilities.</p>
<p>Last month, the United States abstained from a vote that permitted
the council’s 15 members to demand an immediate cease-fire during the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which ends next week.</p>
<p>Ukraine</p>
<p>Blinken also renewed calls for the U.S. Congress to release military
aid for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We are at a critical moment where it is absolutely essential to get
Ukrainians what they continue to need to defend themselves, particularly
when it comes to munitions and air defenses,” Blinken said during a
visit to a defense facility in Paris with French Defense Minister
Sébastien Lecornu.</p>
<p>Congress is yet to approve the Biden administration’s supplementary
budget request that would provide aid to resupply Ukraine’s armed forces
and help the country fend off Russian offensives.</p>
<p>Biden has called on the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives
to approve the military and financial aid package. House Republicans
have delayed action on it for months, prioritizing domestic issues.</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Ukrainian
forces will have to retreat “step by step, in small steps,” if Kyiv
doesn’t receive the U.S. military aid.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Séjourné was in Beijing earlier this week. He
said after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that France
expects China to convey “clear messages” to its close partner Russia
regarding Moscow’s actions in Ukraine.</p>
<p>France and China have sought to strengthen ties in recent years.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is planning a visit to France in May.</p>
<p>During meetings in Paris in February, Wang told French President
Emmanuel Macron that Beijing appreciated his country’s “independent”
stance. But Paris has also sought to press Beijing on its close ties
with Moscow, which have only grown closer since the 2022 invasion of
Ukraine.</p>
<p>U.S. and French officials said they are working closely to
effectively prevent the transfer of weapons and materials to Russia from
North Korea and China, which could fuel Moscow’s defense industrial
base.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat is also set to express U.S. support for the
U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as he holds talks
with UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay.</p>
<p>The United States and France have been among Ukraine’s top supporters
in the two years since Russia launched the invasion of its neighbor.</p>
<p>The State Department said efforts to bring stability to Haiti would
be another topic on the agenda for the meeting of U.S. and French
officials.</p>
<p>Blinken will travel from Paris to Brussels for a meeting of NATO
foreign ministers as the alliance celebrates its 75th anniversary.</p>
<p>While in Brussels, Blinken is also scheduled to meet with Ukrainian
counterpart Dmytro Kuleba and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.</p>
<p>A three-way meeting of the United States, European Union and Armenia
is set for Friday, with the State Department saying the session will
focus on “U.S. and EU support for Armenia’s economic resilience as it
works to diversify its trade partnerships and address humanitarian
needs.”</p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Armenian Prime
Minister Nikol Pashinyan will lead their respective delegations.</p>
<p>Separate U.S.-EU trade and technology talks will close Blinken’s stop
in Belgium.</p>

<h2 id="biden-tells-chinas-xi-to-stay-out-of-us-elections">Biden tells
China’s Xi to stay out of US elections</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — President Joe Biden again warned Chinese President Xi
Jinping against meddling in the November U.S. presidential election
during the two leaders’ phone call Tuesday. The call is part of U.S.
efforts to maintain “open lines of communication to responsibly manage
competition and prevent unintended conflict,” the White House said.</p>
<p>In various engagements, the U.S. has raised its “continual
reinforcement of concern” against Chinese election interference, a
senior administration official told reporters in a Monday briefing
previewing the call.</p>
<p>Biden last raised the issue in his meeting with Xi in Woodside,
California, last November. Beijing has repeatedly said it has no
interest in meddling in U.S. internal affairs.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we ever really take the Chinese at their word when
they say they will or will not do something,” the senior administration
official said. “It is about verifying.”</p>
<p>A declassified U.S. intelligence threat assessment released in
February warned of Beijing’s “higher degree of sophistication in its
influence activity,” including by using generative AI. The report warned
of “growing efforts to actively exploit perceived U.S. societal
divisions” online.</p>
<p>“Spamouflage, a persistent China-linked influence operation, has
weaponized U.S. political, economic, and cultural wedge issues in its
campaigns,” said Max Lesser, a senior analyst of Emerging Threats at the
Foundation for Defense of Democracies.</p>
<p>Spamouflage leverages specific issues to target Biden, Lesser told
VOA. For example, a post sharing an article from Fox news covering a
Pro-Palestinian protest was shared by a Spamouflage account with the
added commentary “Biden’s defeat is a foregone conclusion.”</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said
in a statement sent to VOA that China is “committed to the principle of
non-interference” and that claims about Beijing influencing U.S.
presidential elections are “completely fabricated.”</p>
<p>The leaders also reviewed progress on key issues discussed at the
Woodside Summit, including counter-narcotics cooperation to curb
fentanyl trafficking and the recently re-established
military-to-military communication, addressing AI-related risks, and
efforts on climate change and people-to-people exchanges, the White
House said in its readout of the call.</p>
<p>US-Japan-Philippines trilateral summit</p>
<p>The Biden-Xi call came as the White House prepares for a trilateral
summit where Biden will host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. next week.</p>
<p>The first-ever “minilateral” gathering is set to unveil a series of
initiatives including increasing maritime cooperation to counter China’s
aggressive behavior in the South China Sea. Beijing claims almost the
entirety of the South China Sea, overlapping claims of the Philippines,
Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.</p>
<p>Washington is concerned over the latest flare-up with China stepping
up its use of water cannons against Philippine vessels to block a
resupply mission to the Second Thomas Shoal. Since 1999, Philippine
soldiers have guarded a wrecked ship left on the shoal to maintain the
country’s sovereignty claims over the Spratly Islands in the South China
Sea.</p>
<p>The goal is to make clear to Xi that the U.S. “will not stand idly by
if this gray zone coercion continues to escalate and potentially leads
to the loss of lives of Filipino sailors,” Gregory Polling told VOA
during a Center for Strategic and International Studies briefing
Tuesday. Polling directs CSIS’ Southeast Asia Program and Asia Maritime
Transparency Initiative.</p>
<p>Grey zone tactics refer to activities and actions between peace and
war that fall below the threshold of armed conflict. China’s firing of
water cannons is an example of a grey zone action as it falls short of
triggering the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty.</p>
<p>As Taiwan prepares to inaugurate its new president next month, Biden
“emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait,” said the White House. Beijing considers the
self-governed island its wayward province, and cross-strait issues have
been one of the sharpest sources of tension in U.S.-China rivalry.</p>
<p>Chinese malicious cyber activity is another key concern. Last month,
the U.S. sanctioned China-linked hackers for targeting U.S. critical
infrastructure. Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology Company, Limited
or Wuhan XRZ is a front company for China’s Ministry of State Security
that has “served as cover for multiple malicious cyber operations,” the
administration said.</p>
<p>The official highlighted continued diplomatic engagement including a
visit to China by U.S. Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen in the coming
days and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the coming weeks. The
U.S. and China are also set to hold a dialogue on AI risk management in
coming weeks.</p>
<p>The leaders also discussed other regional and global issues, with
Biden raising concerns over Bejing’s “support for Russia’s defense
industrial base and its impact on European and transatlantic security,”
the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and human rights protection
in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Paris Huang contributed to this report.</p>

starting to test the blogroll software with a few users, but we hit a
problem before we began. The blogroll code includes the CSS for the
Bootstrap Toolkit. I use it as if it were part of the OS, but not
everyone does, and it changes the global values of things. So when you
install it on a page that has its own ideas how things should work, you
can get an unpleasant effect (to put it mildly). So I created a
localized
<a href="http://scripting.com/code/blogroll/smallbootstrap.css">subset</a>
of Bootstrap’s styles, to be a better guest in other people’s pages.
That is now done. I expect we’ll see more of that kind of thing. Web
plugins are a new area for me. I guess that’s pretty obvious.</p>

Big Winners of This Crypto Bull Market Are the `Left
Curves’</i></a>:<br />
<blockquote>
There is a surprising amount of respect for people who appear to know
nothing about the industry. They’re known as the “left curves.”<br />
<br /> The nickname comes from a popular meme in crypto that shows a
bell curve with investors on the left who know nothing, or very little,
and those in the fat middle of the curve who know something about
crypto. On the right are investors who seemingly know everything.

Why does Shen think those who know nothing about cryptocurrencies are
the big winners? Because they are jumping in to yet another
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-21/the-big-winners-of-this-crypto-bull-market-are-the-left-curves">cruptocurrency
bubble</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For example, a crypto project with pseudonymous co-founders including
“Smokey The Bera” and “Dev Bear” has become a unicorn after it raised
millions of dollars from institutional investors such as Brevan Howard
Digital. Another token with no real utility — only a cute picture of a
dog wearing a hat — has increased by more than 1,400 times its value
from three months ago. A developer of a sloth-themed memecoin called
Slerf claimed they accidentally burned a large amount of the tokens
after raising $10 million.<br /> <br /> What a great time to be a left
curve! In this bull market, forget about highbrow ideas like revamping
Wall Street. Give up on dreams of replacing traditional artwork with
nonfungible tokens. Instead, don’t overthink it. Just
“<a href="https://twitter.com/allnick/status/1770093646768976229">choose

Well, yes, but the much-desired
<a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2023/11/desperately-seeking-retail.html">retail
traders</a> don’t seem convinced. Even the mania around spot Bitcoin ETS
has died down, as the chart shows.
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-21/the-big-winners-of-this-crypto-bull-market-are-the-left-curves">Shen
writes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
How did this happen? How did crypto’s greatest comeback take place so
fast, so hilariously and — at times — so stupidly? Why did crypto
evangelists give up their dreams? At its core, it’s because the market
is still living under the shadows of past catastrophes like FTX’s
collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup.<br /> <br /> In the past bull markets,
when Bitcoin went up, everything else went up amid small-scale rotations
between major and small-cap coins. But in this bull market, the rotation
is more severe: As Solana went up in the past month, the price of Ether
went down dramatically — a simple piece of evidence that shows there’s
less money being thrown at the crypto market today than three years ago.
</blockquote>
The “past catastrophes like FTX’s collapse and TerraUSD’s blowup” may be
old news but to their victims they aren’t even close to over. The best
FTX’s creditors can hope for is to get back what their HODL-ings were
worth <i>before</i> Bitcoin took off moon-wards, and who knows when that
might happen.<br /> <br /> Kevin T. Dugan’s
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html"><i>The
Crypto World Has a New Villain</i></a> starts with the story of one
victim of yet another “past catastrophe”:<br />
<blockquote>
“I had no idea who Barry Silbert was or anything until after November
16, 2022,” Eric Asquith told me. That date was when he was pretty sure
he had lost his family’s savings of $1,052,000.
</blockquote>
Asquith wasn’t on the Left Curve but just a bit
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">left
of the middle</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
He didn’t buy bitcoin or other meme tokens. Instead, earlier that year,
he moved over cash from his business — just a little at first, then more
— and converted it into digital currencies he thought were as good as
cash. The digital coins were called GUSD, and each was worth exactly $1
because the company that minted them —
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/12/how-the-winkleviis-second-act-in-bitcoin-went-bad.html">Tyler
and Cameron Winklevoss’s crypto exchange, Gemini</a> — backed each one
with real money and assets.
</blockquote>
But Asquith’s GUSD were deposited into Gemini’s Earn program to get its
5.5% interest, far more than banks were paying. But Asquith and the
other Earn depositors were far enough left on the curve that they didn’t
know Earn
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">wasn’t
like a bank savings account</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
What Asquith did not fully understand was that his money was no longer
with Gemini. In one sense, Genesis, a crypto company owned by Barry
Silbert had it, but even that wasn’t quite true. Soon-to-collapse hedge
funds with names like Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research — Sam
Bankman-Fried’s personal fund — were quietly borrowing from Silbert’s
shop. Asquith’s money, and that of tens of thousands of others, was
being used by SBF and others to make giant bets on some of the
highest-flying, most volatile digital tokens.
</blockquote>
Then Terra/Luna collapsed and things started to fall apart. Amy Castor
and David Gerard
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2022/11/25/crypto-collapse-ftx-first-day-hearing-genesis-screws-dcg-silvergate-bank/">reported</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of Genesis’s biggest customers was Three Arrows Capital (3AC), who
they’d lent $2.4 billion. After 3AC blew up in May, DCG assumed $1.2
billion of the liabilities to keep the hit off Genesis’ books. Genesis
had been the single largest creditor of 3AC.<br /> <br /> Genesis also
had money on FTX. As FTX was falling apart, Genesis tweeted on November
8 that they had no exposure, and it was fine. Two days later, Genesis
admitted they had “~$175M in locked funds in our FTX trading account,”
and they were not fine.<br /> <br /> Genesis scrambled to find more
capital. Genesis and DCG needed $1 billion in emergency credit by 10
a.m. EST on November 14, but didn’t get it. Even Binance turned them
down.<br /> <br /> So two days later, Genesis suspended
withdrawals,<br /> …<br /> One of Genesis’s biggest customers is Gemini
Trust, run by the Winklevoss twins, that operated its own “yield”
program, Gemini Earn, for retail investors.<br /> <br /> Gemini was
supposed to be the safe exchange — but it was exposed to risks via
Genesis. There’s now $700 million that Gemini Earn customers can’t
withdraw — because it’s stuck on Genesis.
</blockquote>
Gemini
<a href="https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2023/01/12/crypto-collapse-dcgs-check-kiting-comes-home-to-roost-nexo-raided-voyager-sale-to-binance-progresses-unbanking-the-banked/">tried
to get the cash</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
On January 8, Gemini terminated the Master Loan Agreement with Genesis
and emailed customers accordingly. This “requires Genesis to return all
outstanding assets in the program.” Genesis did not return the funds by
the end of January 10 — so they were officially in default on the loan.
At this point, Genesis can pull the pin and try to put Gemini into
involuntary bankruptcy.
</blockquote>
They did, and there followed a year of legal wrangling between Gemini,
Genesis and Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, which owns Genesis.
The
<a href="https://amycastor.com/2023/01/13/sec-sues-genesis-and-gemini-genesis-owes-3-billion-to-creditors/">SEC
sued both Gemini and Genesis</a>, and so did
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">the
New York Attorney General</a>. While the wrangling continued, another of
the semi-regular cryptocurrency bull markets took off until
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">in
February 2024</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
the victims, Silbert’s now-bankrupt crypto-lending operation, the
Winklevoss twins, and regulators hammered out a deal to pay everybody
back in full. The crypto bull market of 2024 made it possible to pay
back Earn customers not some fraction of what they invested but the
generally much higher sum of what their holdings would now be worth.
</blockquote>
Everyone started
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">cele:wbrating</a>;<br />
<blockquote>
Except there was Silbert. Earn victims who had been unfamiliar with him
would soon learn that he had made his first fortune by studying the ins
and outs of the bankruptcy system and using it to his financial
advantage. Since February, the billionaire investor has been relying on
a controversial interpretation of bankruptcy law to stop Asquith and all
the other victims from getting the bigger payout, the one based on
current prices. Instead, to simplify a bit, he would prefer to keep that
money himself. “DCG cannot support a plan that not only deprives DCG of
its corporate governance rights but also violates United States
bankruptcy code,” a spokeswoman for the company said.<br /> <br /> The
victims have taken to calling it “the Barry Trade”: If Silbert is
successful, he would be able to pocket as much as $1 billion in funds
that would otherwise be returned to them. At the very least, Silbert may
substantially delay the money being returned to Earn customers.<br />
…<br /> Silbert’s legal logic is that the bankruptcy code sets a date to
value victims’ claims in U.S. dollars, and in Genesis’ case, it just
happened to be around the market’s lows.
</blockquote>
People started
<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-twins-crypto-firms-charged-by-sec">talking
to the press about Gemini</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Former Gemini employees told The Beast that Gemini Earn’s terms and
conditions were highly dubious from the outset. One staffer recalled
reading the fine print for the first time, saying, “[We] were like,
‘Holy shit, are you fucking kidding me?’”<br /> <br /> Among those
terms: Customer assets were loaned out on “an unsecured basis,” which
meant that their money would not be safe in the event of a market
collapse. The deposits were also not insured, nor were they guaranteed
against errors or fraudulent activity.
</blockquote>
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">And
Genesis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
“Whatever Gemini may or may not have done pales in comparison to what
you see at Genesis, which was more than negligent when it came to
protecting customer assets and complying with general best practices,”
one former employee said. Among those problems, the person said, was not
screening clients who were on, say, the Treasury’s blacklists — an
allegation that was supported by a separate January suit filed by New
York Department of Financial Services.
</blockquote>
This isn’t a “past catastrophe”. For the victims
<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/barry-silbert-is-the-crypto-worlds-new-villain.html">there
is no end in sight</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A ruling isn’t expected until April. Since the settlement announcement,
the victims have resigned themselves to an even longer wait as Silbert
continues to fight. “A year ago, there was a deal that was proposed.
Everyone was celebrating in a very similar way,” Asquith said. “Now,
I’ll believe it when it’s in my account.”
</blockquote>
<p>This case, like Dickens’
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarndyce_and_Jarndyce">Jarndyce v
Jarndyce</a>, will run and run.<br /></p>

vessel uses alternate channel to bypass wreckage at Baltimore bridge
collapse site</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Baltimore — A tugboat pushing a fuel barge was the first vessel to
use an alternate channel to bypass the wreckage of Baltimore’s collapsed
Francis Scott Key Bridge, which had blocked traffic along the vital
port’s main shipping channel.</p>
<p>The barge supplying jet fuel to the Department of Defense left late
Monday and was destined for Delaware’s Dover Air Force Base, though
officials have said the temporary channel is open primarily to vessels
that are helping with the cleanup effort. Some barges and tugs that have
been stuck in the Port of Baltimore since the collapse are also
scheduled to pass through the channel. </p>
<p>Officials said they’re working on a second channel on the southwest
side of the main channel that will allow for deeper draft vessels, but
they didn’t say when that might open. </p>
<p>Gov. Wes Moore is set Tuesday to visit one of two centers that the
Small Business Administration opened in the area to help companies get
loans to assist them with losses caused by the disruption of the bridge
collapse. </p>
<p>Crews are undertaking the complicated work of removing steel and
concrete at the site of the bridge’s deadly collapse after a container
ship lost power and crashed into a supporting column. On Sunday, dive
teams surveyed parts of the bridge and checked the ship, and workers in
lifts used torches to cut above-water parts of the twisted steel
superstructure. </p>
<p>Authorities believe six workers plunged to their deaths in the
collapse, including two whose bodies were recovered last week. Two other
workers survived. </p>
<p>Moore, a Democrat, said at a Monday afternoon news conference that
his top priority is recovering the four remaining bodies, followed by
reopening shipping channels. He said that he understands the urgency but
that the risks are significant. Crews have described the mangled steel
girders of the fallen bridge as “chaotic wreckage,” he said. </p>
<p>“What we’re finding is it is more complicated than we hoped for
initially,” said U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral Shannon Gilreath. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ship remains stationary, and its 21 crew members
remain on board for now, officials said. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden is expected to visit the collapse site Friday to
meet with state and local officials and get at federal response
efforts. </p>
<p>The bridge fell as the cargo ship Dali lost power March 26 shortly
after leaving Baltimore on its way to Sri Lanka. The ship issued a
mayday alert, which allowed just enough time for police to stop traffic,
but not enough to save a roadwork crew filling potholes on the
bridge. </p>
<p>The Dali is managed by Synergy Marine Group and owned by Grace Ocean
Private Ltd., both of Singapore. Danish shipping giant Maersk chartered
the Dali. </p>
<p>Synergy and Grace Ocean filed a court petition Monday seeking to
limit their legal liability, a routine but important procedure for cases
litigated under U.S. maritime law. A federal court in Maryland will
ultimately decide who is responsible and how much they owe. </p>
<p>The filing seeks to cap the companies’ liability at roughly $43.6
million. It estimates that the vessel itself is valued at up to $90
million and was owed over $1.1 million in income from freight. The
estimate also deducts two major expenses: at least $28 million in repair
costs and at least $19.5 million in salvage costs. </p>
<p>Officials are trying to determine how to rebuild the major bridge,
which was completed in 1977. It carried Interstate 695 around southeast
Baltimore and became a symbol of the city’s working-class roots and
maritime culture. </p>
<p>Congress is expected to consider aid packages to help people who lose
jobs or businesses because of the prolonged closure of the Port of
Baltimore. The port handles more cars and farm equipment than any other
U.S. facility.</p>

science and international climate agreements.” A ruling is expected in

<li>Record number of fires recorded in Venezuela
</h3>
<p>
<strong></strong>More than 30,200 fires were detected in Venezuela
between January and March, the highest number ever recorded for that
three-month period. The region is suffering from intense drought driven
by human-caused climate change and the El Niño weather pattern.
Researchers are worried these fires are a sign of things to come.
“Everything is indicating we’re going to see other events of
catastrophic fires – megafires that are huge in size and height,”
Manoela Machado, a fire researcher at University of Oxford,

in a human in Texas, marking the first such case since the virus was
recently identified in cows across several states, and only the second
case in U.S. history. The current outbreak of H5N1 has decimated bird
populations across the world and also spread to mammals, including
seals, mink, and now cows. Health experts worry the virus could mutate
to become easily transmissible between humans, but so far there is no
evidence of that happening. Still, “every single time is a little bit of

change proposal suggests switching the main Fedora Workstation release
to KDE Plasma</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: OS News</p>
<p>Update: the proposal has now been formally announced on the devel
mailing list and Fedora Discussions. I have been assured by the main
author of the proposal itself that this is very much not an April Fools
joke, but of course, there’s still the very real possibility we’re being
led on here. Still, I’m taking the risk and treating this as a serious
change proposal for Fedora, even though it’s likely to cause some
controversy in the wider Fedora community. The proposal is written by
Joshua Strobl, the lead developer of Budgie. Yes, this is a change
proposal to make KDE the default desktop environment of Fedora
Workstation. The reasoning is that KDE is more approachable for new
users than GNOME, it supports standards better, the industry seems to be
making moves to KDE (see the Steam Deck), and so on. KDE also has more
advanced features people have come to expect from a desktop, like HDR,
VRR, and more, and it’s the more advanced Wayland desktop. The important
note here is that in the highly unlikely event this proposal would be
accepted, it’s not like current Fedora GNOME users will be ‘upgraded’ to
KDE when Fedora 42 gets released. The idea is to promote the current
Fedora Plasma spin to the main Fedora Workstation release, and demote
the Fedora GNOME release to a mere Fedora spin, like KDE is now. While I
would personally support this change, it’s pretty much 100% unlikely
this change proposal will make it through. Red Hat and Fedora are
entirely GNOME-first, and no matter how much I believe that’s misguided
when looking at the state of the two primary open source desktops today,
that’s not going to change. Still, it’s an interesting discussion point,
if only to highlight that the frustrations with GNOME run a lot deeper
than people seem to think.</p>

2024-03-27 Sick? Or Hayfever?
</h1>
<p>
Back from the trip to Locarno and I’m feeling sick. The nose, the
frontal sinus cavity, ouch.
</p>
<p>
But strangely enough, the birch pollen season has also started. So what
is it?
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2024-03-26-sick-1.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
(Zürich is super dark red.)
</p>
<p>
The report says:
</p>
<p>
“Eschen und Birken blühen frühzeitig in der gesamten Schweiz, und für
deren Pollen werden in den kommenden Tagen im Flachland und in mittleren
Lagen mässige bis starke Belastungswerte erwartet.”
</p>
<p>
Ash and birch are in bloom earlier than usual.
</p>
<p>
I’ll take one of these Cetirizine-based hayfever pills, drink another
cup of herbal infusion and go back to bed. Hopefully at least one of
these things will help.

<p>
<strong>2024-03-29</strong>. Definitely sick. 🤒

<p>
<strong>2024-03-30</strong>. Still sick, but the fever is gone. Perhaps
now it’s just the hayfever?

<p>
<strong>2024-04-01</strong>. Actually spent some time at the laptop. I

</p>
<p>
<strong>2024-04-02</strong>. Recovery is on track. Falling asleep was
hard. Some nose blowing still. Not sure about focus. It’s good enough

tomorrow!

id="person-is-diagnosed-with-bird-flu-after-being-in-contact-with-cows-in-texas">Person
is diagnosed with bird flu after being in contact with cows in
Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA — A person in Texas has been diagnosed with bird flu, an
infection tied to the recent discovery of the virus in dairy cows,
health officials said Monday.</p>
<p>The patient was being treated with an antiviral drug and their only
reported symptom was eye redness, Texas health officials said. Health
officials say the person had been in contact with cows presumed to be
infected, and the risk to the public remains low. </p>
<p>It marks the first known instance globally of a person catching this
version of bird flu from a mammal, federal health officials said.</p>
<p>However, there’s no evidence of person-to-person spread or that
anyone has become infected from milk or meat from livestock, said
Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Genetic tests don’t suggest that the virus suddenly is spreading more
easily or that it is causing more severe illness, Shah said. And current
antiviral medications still seem to work, he added.</p>
<p>Last week, dairy cows in Texas and Kansas were reported to be
infected with bird flu — and federal agriculture officials later
confirmed infections in a Michigan dairy herd that had recently received
cows from Texas. None of the hundreds of affected cows have died, Shah
said.</p>
<p>Since 2020, a bird flu virus has been spreading among more animal
species – including dogs, cats, skunks, bears and even seals and
porpoises – in scores of countries. </p>
<p>However, the detection in U.S. livestock is an “unexpected and
problematic twist,” said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak
investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska’s public
health college.</p>
<p>This bird flu was first identified as a threat to people during a
1997 outbreak in Hong Kong. More than 460 people have died in the past
two decades from bird flu infections, according to the World Health
Organization. </p>
<p>Most infected people got it directly from birds, but scientists have
been on guard for any sign of spread among people. </p>
<p>Texas officials didn’t identify the newly infected person, nor
release any details about what brought them in contact with the
cows.</p>
<p>The CDC does not recommend testing for people who have no symptoms.
Roughly a dozen people in Texas who did have symptoms were tested in
connection with the dairy cow infections, but only the one person came
back positive, Shah said.</p>
<p>It’s only the second time a person in the United States has been
diagnosed with what’s known as Type A H5N1 virus. In 2022, a prison
inmate in a work program picked it up while killing infected birds at a
poultry farm in Montrose County, Colorado. His only symptom was fatigue,
and he recovered.</p>

<h2 id="us-britain-announce-partnership-on-ai-safety-testing">US,
Britain announce partnership on AI safety, testing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-02, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States and Britain on Monday announced a new
partnership on the science of artificial intelligence safety, amid
growing concerns about upcoming next-generation versions.</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and British Technology Secretary
Michelle Donelan signed a memorandum of understanding in Washington to
jointly develop advanced AI model testing, following commitments
announced at an AI Safety Summit in Bletchley Park in November.</p>
<p>“We all know AI is the defining technology of our generation,”
Raimondo said. “This partnership will accelerate both of our institutes
work across the full spectrum to address the risks of our national
security concerns and the concerns of our broader society.”</p>
<p>Britain and the United States are among countries establishing
government-led AI safety institutes.</p>
<p>Britain said in October its institute would examine and test new
types of AI, while the United States said in November it was launching
its own safety institute to evaluate risks from so-called frontier AI
models and is now working with 200 companies and entites.</p>
<p>Under the formal partnership, Britain and the United States plan to
perform at least one joint testing exercise on a publicly accessible
model and are considering exploring personnel exchanges between the
institutes. Both are working to develop similar partnerships with other
countries to promote AI safety.</p>
<p>“This is the first agreement of its kind anywhere in the world,”
Donelan said. “AI is already an extraordinary force for good in our
society and has vast potential to tackle some of the world’s biggest
challenges, but only if we are able to grip those risks.”</p>
<p>Generative AI, which can create text, photos and videos in response
to open-ended prompts, has spurred excitement as well as fears it could
make some jobs obsolete, upend elections and potentially overpower
humans and catastrophic effects.</p>
<p>In a joint interview with Reuters Monday, Raimondo and Donelan urgent
joint action was needed to address AI risks.</p>
<p>“Time is of the essence because the next set of models are about to
be released, which will be much, much more capable,” Donelan said. “We
have a focus one the areas that we are dividing and conquering and
really specializing.”</p>
<p>Raimondo said she would raise AI issues at a meeting of the U.S.-EU
Trade and Technology Council in Belgium Thursday.</p>
<p>The Biden administration plans to soon announce additions to its AI
team, Raimondo said. “We are pulling in the full resources of the U.S.
government.”</p>
<p>Both countries plan to share key information on capabilities and
risks associated with AI models and systems and technical research on AI
safety and security.</p>
<p>In October, Biden signed an executive order that aims to reduce the
risks of AI. In January, the Commerce Department said it was proposing
to require U.S. cloud companies to determine whether foreign entities
are accessing U.S. data centers to train AI models.</p>
<p>Britain said in February it would spend more than 100 million pounds
($125.5 million) to launch nine new research hubs and AI train
regulators about the technology.</p>
<p>Raimondo said she was especially concerned about the threat of AI
applied to bioterrorism or a nuclear war simulation.</p>
<p>“Those are the things where the consequences could be catastrophic
and so we really have to have zero tolerance for some of these models
being used for that capability,” she said.</p>

<p>NEW YORK — The judge in Donald Trump’s hush-money criminal case
expanded the former president’s gag order Monday after the former
president assailed the judge’s daughter and made a false claim about her
on social media last week.</p>
<p>Judge Juan M. Merchan said his original gag order issued last Tuesday
did not include members of his family, but Trump’s subsequent actions
warranted including them.</p>
<p>Merchan’s daughter, Loren Merchan, is a Democratic political
consultant. Prosecutors had urged Merchan to clarify or expand his gag
order after Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Loren Merchan
“makes money by working to ‘Get Trump,’” and wrongly accused her of
posting a social media photo showing him behind bars.</p>
<p>The trial, which involves allegations Trump falsified payment records
in a scheme to cover up negative stories during his 2016 presidential
campaign, is scheduled to begin April 15. Trump denies wrongdoing and
has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records.</p>
<p>Trump’s lawyers had fought the gag order and its expansion, arguing
that Trump was engaging in protected political campaign speech.</p>
