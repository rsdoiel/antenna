## Temperatures expected to surge past 110 F/43.3 C during US heat wave

date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA

phoenix, arizona — The first heat wave of the season is bringing triple-digit temperatures earlier than usual to much of the southwestern United States, where forecasters warned residents Tuesday to brace for "dangerously hot conditions" with highs expected to top 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 Celsius) in the days ahead in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Phoenix, Arizona. 


By Wednesday, most of an area stretching from southeastern California to central Arizona will see "easily their hottest" weather since last September and record daily highs will be in jeopardy throughout the region, the National Weather Service said. 


Excessive heat warnings have been issued from 10 a.m. Wednesday to 8 p.m. Friday for parts of southern Nevada and Arizona. The unseasonably hot weather is expected to make its way into parts of the Pacific Northwest by the end of the week. 


"We're looking at high temperatures well in the 90s and 100s, temperatures well above average for the time of year — some spots as much as 10 to 20 degrees above average," National Weather Service meteorologist Marc Chenard said on Tuesday. 


Southeastern California, southern Nevada and much of Arizona will be affected most, he said. 


"As we go through the week, some of those higher temperatures are also going to spread north, potentially getting into portions of the Pacific Northwest as well," Chenard said. 


"We do have several days where these temperatures will persist, and that usually adds to the impact. If there is just one day, it doesn't tend to have as much of an impact," he said. "But when you start getting two, three or four days, this heat and then even warm temperatures at night, you start to see the impact increase." 


The unseasonably hot weather already has taken a toll in some areas. The U.S. Border Patrol reported on Monday that four migrants died last weekend from heat-related causes while attempting to cross the border in southeastern New Mexico, near El Paso, Texas. 


Border Patrol El Paso Sector Chief Anthony Good urged migrants not to try to cross the border in the extreme heat. 


"The desert environment is extremely unforgiving, especially during the summer months," Good said. "We urge anyone considering crossing illegally to understand the severe risks involved." 


Fire crews will be on high alert, especially in Arizona, where fire restrictions went into effect before Memorial Day in some areas and will be ordered by Thursday across most of the western and south-central parts of the state, authorities said. 


Fire forecasters at the Southwest Coordination Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said weather in the region doesn't typically become so hot until mid- or late June. 


"It does seem like Mother Nature is turning up the heat on us a little sooner than usual," Tiffany Davila, spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Forestry and Fire Management, said Monday evening. 


"We can't back down from a fire just because it's pushing 113 degrees outside. But we do keep a close eye on everybody in the field. Make sure they are keeping hydrated and taking more breaks than they normally would," she told The Associated Press. 


Highs on Monday reached 110 F (43.3 C) at Death Valley National Park in California near the Nevada line. 


In Las Vegas, Nevada, where the high topped out at 103 F (39.4 C) on Monday, temperatures will soar to 10 to 15 degrees above normal during the second half of the week — peaking at 111 (43.8 C) on Thursday. 


A high of 120 F (48.8 C) is forecast for Thursday at Furnace Creek in Death Valley. 


The current forecast of 113 F (45 C) for Phoenix on Thursday would break the daily record high of 111 F (43.8 C) set in 2016. 


Last summer, Phoenix saw a record 31 straight days of at least 110 degrees F (43.3 C), stretching from the last day of June through the entire month of July. At least 400 of the 645 heat-related deaths that occurred last year were during that monthlong period.

## Charges filed in Wisconsin against attorneys, aide who worked for Trump in 2020

date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA

Madison, Wisconsin — Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed felony forgery charges Tuesday against two attorneys and an aide who helped submit paperwork falsely saying that former President Donald Trump had won the battleground state in 2020.


The charges were filed against attorneys Kenneth Chesebro, 62, and Jim Troupis, 70, and former Trump aide Mike Roman, 51, who allegedly delivered Wisconsin's fake elector paperwork to a Pennsylvania congressman's staffer in order to get them to then-Vice President Mike Pence on Jan. 6, 2021.


All three are due in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 19, according to court records. They each face one felony count punishable by up to six years in prison and fines of up to $10,000.


Troupis and Chesebro did not return voicemail messages left Tuesday. Roman did not have an attorney listed in court records.


Kaul, a Democrat, has faced pressure to bring action against the 10 fake electors, who have yet to be charged with any criminal wrongdoing. He has previously suggested that he was relying on federal investigators while also not ruling out a state probe.


Kaul didn't rule out filing more charges, saying that the investigation is ongoing.


"Our approach has been focusing on following the facts where they lead," he said at a news conference.


Democratic Gov. Tony Evers offered a one-word response to news of the charges being filed: "Good."


Electors are people appointed to represent voters in presidential elections. The winner of the popular vote in each state determines which party's electors are sent to the Electoral College, which meets in December after the election to certify the outcome.


The fake elector efforts are central to an August federal indictment filed against Trump alleging he tried to overturn results of the 2020 election. Federal prosecutors, investigating his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, have also said the scheme originated in Wisconsin. Trump also faces charges in Georgia and has denied wrongdoing.


Michigan and Nevada have also criminally charged fake electors.


Chesebro and Roman were among the 18 people indicted along with Trump in August in a sprawling racketeering indictment in Georgia. They're accused of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally overturn the 2020 election in that state.


Chesebro in October pleaded guilty to one felony charge of conspiracy to commit filing false documents after reaching a deal with Georgia prosecutors. Roman has pleaded not guilty to racketeering and conspiracy charges related to a plan to have Republican electors meet and cast Electoral College votes for Trump even though Biden had won Georgia.


The 10 Wisconsin electors, Chesebro and Troupis, who was Trump's attorney in Wisconsin, all settled a civil lawsuit that was brought against them last year.


Documents released as part of those settlements showed that the strategy in Wisconsin replicated moves in six other swing states.


The complaint goes into detail largely citing those documents, interviews and testimony given to Congress about how the fake elector scheme was hatched.


The complaint details how Chesebro emailed a memo on Nov. 18, 2020, to Troupis and others arguing that electors representing Trump should meet on Dec. 14, 2020, to preserve the Trump-Pence electoral slate in case a court or Legislature would determine them to be the winners.


Chesebro argued in a subsequent memo that the Trump electors could be counted by Congress if court challenges to his loss were still pending. Troupis sent both memos to the Trump White House, according to the complaint.


On Dec. 9, 2020, Chesebro emailed Troupis a memo with instructions for the Dec. 14, 2020, elector meetings. Two days later, Chesebro emailed Trump aide Roman details of the plan, the complaint said.


During or around the time of the Dec. 14, 2020, meeting, Chesebro sent a message to Troupis and Roman that said, "WI meeting of the 'real' electors is a go!!!," the complaint said. Troupis responded with a "thumbs up" emoji, the complaint said.


The complaint also details how the fake elector slate was delivered to Chesebro from Wisconsin to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2021, by Alesha Guenther, a law student working part-time at the Republican Party of Wisconsin. Roman told Guenther to deliver the paperwork only to Chesebro.


"5 mins until I make the drop," Guenther texted at one point, according to the complaint. "I feel like a drug dealer."


Once Chesebro was given the documents, he emailed Roman to let him know he had them.


Roman then arranged for a congressional staff member to meet Chesebro and take the document. Chesebro sent Roman a message confirming that it had been done, the complaint said.


Trump lost Wisconsin to Biden, a Democrat, by fewer than 21,000 votes. Trump carried Wisconsin by a similar margin in 2016.


Government and outside investigations have uniformly found there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have swung the 2020 election. But Trump has continued to spread falsehoods about the election, particularly in Wisconsin.

## What’s Even Better Than Building New Wind Farms?

date: 2024-06-04, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM3MjU1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNTAwOTk1MH0.EQDEmw-QH6WiQi-X5XXdSTjmCUmJ2ZO28yIkzBhljkI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">It’s not easy to build a wind project. Many of the best spots for generating wind power are already occupied by turbines. Even if you do find a good one, then comes everything else — inflation in the supply chain, convincing a local community that they want a wind farm near them, leasing the land, and so on and so forth. The whole process <a href="https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/e8-why-does-it-take-five-years-build-wind-farm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>can take as long as five years</u></a>.</p><p>But what about just making an existing wind farm … better.</p><p>This option, known as repowering, is becoming more attractive to wind developers and operators as existing wind assets age — operators get a more efficient wind farm, and developers get to avoid the many headaches of starting from scratch. The topic came up Tuesday, in fact, at the American Council on Renewable Energy’s 2024 Finance Forum. There are “some real opportunities for repower,” said David Giordano, BlackRock’s global head of climate infrastructure, on a panel about scaling capital to meet demand growth for renewables.</p><p>“When you repower a project, oftentimes you can utilize some of the existing infrastructure. And that means that you can add new equipment without the full cost of a greenfield development,” Eric Lantz, director of the Wind Energy Technologies Office at the Department of Energy, explained to me. When you install more modern equipment, he said, “you have higher hub heights, you have larger rotors — you can capture more energy from that site.” </p><p>Even if you tear down everything and rebuild from the ground up, Lantz told me, repowering still means you can use the existing transmission and interconnection, meaning developers can get more generation without having to deal with infamously long interconnection queues, which can impose yet more years on the energy development timeline. </p><p>Lantz <a href="https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/242009754/Kitzing_et_al_2020_multifaceted_drivers_repowering_AAM.pdf" target="_blank">collaborated on a 2020 research paper</a> with a trio of Danish wind researchers (Denmark has one of the largest and most advanced wind power industries in the world) and found that from 2012 to 2019, 38% of all wind energy development projects in the country involved replacing old equipment as opposed to building on new sites. Repowering can be attractive to both developers and local communities, the researchers explained, because larger and more efficient turbines can actually reduce the net number of turbines on a given site while generating the same or even more power, with less visual disruption and less maintenance required.</p><p><span></span>Last year, Wood Mackenzie estimated that repowering onshore wind assets would lead to <em>more</em> installed capacity than new offshore wind in 2025 and 2026. In 2022, the U.S. repowered 1.7 gigawatts of wind plants, mostly by upgrading rotors (blades) and nacelle components like gearboxes and generators, <a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/land-based-wind-market-report-2023-edition.pdf" target="_blank"><u>upping their total capacity</u></a> to 1.8 gigawatts, according to the Department of Energy. Average rotor diameter increased from 93 meters to 112 meters, adding on about the length of an 18-wheeler to the typical rotor.</p><p><span></span>Repowering has been a favored strategy of some of the biggest renewable developers, who have large and aging fleets of wind turbines that often already occupy prime spots. At the massive Shepherds Flat site in Oregon, for instance, Brookfield Renewable Partners replaced more than 300 turbines — i.e. over 900 blades — with new ones that were about <a href="https://www.fcltglobal.org/case-study/brookfield/" target="_blank"><u>90 feet longer</u></a>, upping the site’s total generation <a href="https://energyinfo.oregon.gov/blog/2023/2/6/wind-renewable-re-powered-and-recycled" target="_blank"><u>by some 20%</u></a>.</p><p>At a proposed repowering in Southern California, Brookfield wants to replace around 450 turbines with <a href="https://mesarepower.brookfieldusprojects.com/" target="_blank">just eight</a>, while a New York repowering increased generation by almost 30% “while maintaining the same number of units to minimize ground disturbance,” <a href="https://brookfieldrenewableus.com/news-press/brookfield-renewable-u-s-announces-completion-of-wind-repowering-projects-in-new-york-first-in-states-history/" target="_blank"><u>the company said</u></a>. <strong><em></em></strong></p><p>The rationale for repowering, like everything in energy, is a mixture of mechanical and financial. Over time, wind turbines tend to degrade, with actual power generation falling off. Even just by restoring a wind farm’s initial generating capacity, repowering can increase output, with newer, more advanced equipment, capacity can notably increase<strong>. </strong>And when renewable developers have to answer to investors, that cheaper generation can look quite attractive. </p><p>The energy developer NextEra plans to repower 1.4 gigawatts of its wind projects through 2026, the company’s chief financial officer said in an April earning call, and in January said that it had repowered a quarter of its existing 24 megawatts of wind. At that time, NextEra chief executive John Ketchum told analysts that the cost had been “roughly 50% to 80% of the cost of a new build and starting a new 10 years of production tax credits, resulting in attractive returns for shareholders.”</p><p>“With over a decade to potentially qualify for repowering,” he added, “it represents a great opportunity set.”</p><p>Looking at wind projects from before and after 2012, Scott Wilmot, an executive vice president at Enverus Intelligence Research, calculated that average capacity factor increased from around 30% to around 40%. “Swapping new equipment right off the bat, you can get a plus-10 percentage point gain on capacity factor,” he told me.</p><p>And then there’s the tax incentives. Repowering “resets” the production tax credit that’s the lifeblood of the wind industry, allowing owners and developers to claim it for another 10 years. When Enverus looked at a hypothetical project that had been operational since 2011 and repowered in 2023, it was possible that its production tax credit for an additional 10 years could increase from $22 per megawatt to almost $28. “It really does make the economics look quite attractive,” he told me.</p><p>“If you can get close to 10 percentage point capacity factor gain, you blow pretty much any greenfield, new build project out of the water.”</p>

## Columbia Law Review Board Nukes Website Over Palestine Article

<blockquote><p>"Eghbariah’s paper for the Columbia Law Review, or CLR, was published on its website in the early hours of Monday morning. The journal’s board of directors responded by pulling the entire website offline. [...] According to Eghbariah, he worked with editors at the Columbia Law Review for over five months on the 100-plus-page text."</p></blockquote><p>Regardless of your perspective on the ongoing crisis in Israel and Palestine, this seems like a remarkable action: removing a heavily-reviewed, 100+ page legal analysis because it discusses the Nakba, the mass-displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Palestine war.</p><p>The right thing to do would be to publish it - as the editors tried to do - and allow legal discussion to ensue. Instead, the board of directors chose to simply pull the plug on the website.</p><p>As one Columbia professor put it:</p><blockquote><p>“When Columbia Law Professor Herbert Weschler published his important article questioning the underlying justification for Brown v. Board of Education in 1959 it was regarded by many as blasphemous, but is now regarded as canonical. This is what legal scholarship should do at its best, challenge us to think hard about hard things, even when it is uncomfortable doing so.” </p></blockquote><p>If nothing else, this is a reflection of how sensitive these issues are in the current era, whose voices are allowed to be heard, and the conflicts between different ideologies, even on university campuses.</p>

## Surprise! Climeworks Unveils Newer, Faster, Cheaper Tech

date: 2024-06-04, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM3Mjg5NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2Njc5MTU5OH0._TZLoiZmO4a9gmsDUKR7Ki2XJH9U27rDBJsUuvQCv3o/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Direct air capture is leveling up. In a surprise move on Tuesday, Climeworks unveiled new “generation 3” technology that it said can suck up twice as much carbon from the atmosphere using half the amount of energy as its previous designs. </p><p>The Swiss carbon removal company will premiere the new design in the U.S. at its Department of Energy-funded <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/project-cypress-climeworks-heirloom" target="_self"><u>direct air capture “hub” in Louisiana</u></a>, with construction to start in 2026.</p><p>Climeworks already operates the two largest direct air capture plants in the world, both in Iceland. Its <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climeworks-orca-data-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture" target="_self"><u>first commercial-scale plant</u></a>, Orca, was designed to capture 4,000 tons of CO2 per year. Just last month, the company <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climeworks-mammoth-5-things-to-know" target="_self"><u>turned on its second plant, Mammoth</u></a>, which at full capacity is supposed to capture 36,000 tons per year. Now, Climeworks’ third generation breakthrough paves the way for it to build a plant capable of capturing one million tons per year, the company said — a nearly 28x increase.</p><p>Over the past five years, while Climeworks was building Orca and Mammoth, it had also been stealthily developing the next generation tech at its labs in Zurich and Basel with a 50-person team. Like the earlier designs, the new system uses a specially engineered material called a solid sorbent that attracts carbon dioxide molecules when air passes through it. But the company has overhauled both the chemistry of the sorbent and its structure. The new design has more surface area, enabling it to grab twice as much CO2 from the air. The company also said it expects the new sorbents to last three times as long as the previous material.</p><p>In addition to a new sorbent, the gen 3 tech will also feature an updated architecture described as “sleek modular cubes” that “increase capture efficiency, reduce costs, and boost robustness.” The new cubes will make the plants more compact, taking up half the footprint of an older plant with similar capacity. Renderings feature seemingly taller, boxier facilities compared to the earlier, more horizontally-oriented design. </p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="A rendering of Climeworks\u2019 Gen 3 plant." class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="fe5685dc39eadae2d0a8767caa088dce" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="b6d28" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM3NjY2Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MjI0ODQ3Mn0.s--YadeIWzfdbKgkheIcmtse3f2gmqtc75yA4QfeI6o/image.jpg?width=980"/>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of Climeworks</small></p><p>Climeworks has already tested a full-scale model of its new cubes and says it has “confirmed the anticipated breakthrough in efficiency and performance.” It’s hard to know what that means, since the company has never shared its previous tech’s efficiency or performance. But halving its energy use would be a big deal, as that’s one of the most expensive parts of the process. Carbon is extremely dilute in the air, and these machines consume massive amounts of electricity and heat to extract it.</p><p>The company said the breakthrough puts it on track to achieve the cost reductions it has previously promised, with a goal of removing CO2 for $400 to $600 per ton by 2030. (The price range accounts for potential variations in the cost of electricity and CO2 storage in different locations.) That’s about half the amount Climeworks charges today, but it’s still expensive. Some carbon removal companies, like Lithos Carbon, which does enhanced rock weathering, and Vaulted Deep, which buries carbon-rich waste, have already sold credits for less than $400, so Climeworks already faces steep competition to bring its costs down.</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect clarification from Climeworks on its 2030 price estimate per ton of carbon.</em></p>

## Lawyers begin opening statements in Hunter Biden's federal firearms case

date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA

Wilmington, Delaware — Lawyers are making opening statements Tuesday in the federal gun case against President Joe Biden's son Hunter in a trial that is expected to feature testimony from his exes and highly personal details about his struggle with addiction.


Hunter Biden has been charged with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application by saying he was not a drug user and illegally having the gun for 11 days.


Hunter Biden arrived at the courthouse with this wife, Melissa, on Tuesday morning, emerging from an SUV. First lady Jill Biden and his sister Ashley Biden joined him again in the courtroom.


The proceedings come after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department after Republicans decried the now-defunct plea deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.


The trial is unfolding just days after Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the courts have taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.


Jury selection moved at a clip Monday in the president's home state, where Hunter Biden grew up and where, the elder Biden often says, the family is deeply established. Joe Biden spent 36 years as a senator in Delaware, commuting daily back and forth from Washington, D.C.


People just know the story of how Biden's two young sons, Hunter and Beau, were injured in the car accident that killed his wife and baby girl in the early 1970s. And Beau Biden was the former state attorney general before he died at age 46 from cancer.


Some prospective jurors were dismissed because they knew the family personally, others because they held both positive and negative political views about the Bidens and couldn't be impartial. Still, it took only a day to find the jury of six men and six women plus four women serving as alternates, who will decide the case.


One potential juror who was sent home said she didn't know whether she could be impartial because of the opinion she had formed about Hunter Biden based on media reports.


"It's not a good one," she said.


Another was excused because he was aware of the case and said, "It seems like politics is playing a big role in who gets charged with what and when."


But much of the questioning focused on drug use, addiction and gun ownership, as attorneys sought to test prospective jurors' knowledge of the case, and dismiss those with strong thoughts on drug use, or who might want to regulate firearms — some of the very people Biden counts as constituents.


The panel of 12 was chosen out of roughly 65 people. Their names were not made public.


Hunter Biden also faces a trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through the deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.


But Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed.


The lawyers could not come to a resolution on her questions, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator, a former U.S. attorney for Delaware, David Weiss, as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.


Opening statements come as Garland faces members of the Republican-led House judiciary committee in Washington, which has been investigating the president and his family and whose chairman has been at the forefront of a stalled impeachment inquiry stemming from Hunter Biden's business dealings.


The Delaware trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs, though the proceedings were likely to dredge up dark, embarrassing and painful memories.


The president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about his only living son and his sobriety and who must now watch as his son's painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. And the president must do so while he's campaigning under anemic poll numbers and preparing for an upcoming presidential debate with Trump.


In a statement Monday, the president said he has "boundless love" for his son, "confidence in him and respect for his strength."


"I am the President, but I am also a Dad," he said, adding that he would have no further comment on the case. "Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today."


The first lady sat in court all day Monday, her 73rd birthday, watching the proceedings quietly from the front row behind the defense table, as did Hunter Biden's wife, Melissa, and his sister Ashley. The president was nearby most of the day, camped at their Wilmington home. He departed after court adjourned for a campaign reception in Greenwich, Connecticut.


Aboard Air Force One on Monday night, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked if the case might affect the president's ability to do his job, and she replied, "Absolutely not."


"He always puts the American people first and is capable of doing his job," said Jean-Pierre, who declined to say if Biden got updates on the trial throughout the day or spoke to his son after the proceedings concluded.


Biden was traveling to France on Tuesday evening and will be gone the rest of the week. The first lady is scheduled to join him later this week.


The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent followed the 2015 death of his brother from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.


If convicted, Hunter Biden could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum, and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.


Trump is set to be sentenced on July 11 by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who raised the specter of jail time during the trial after the former president racked up thousands of dollars in fines for violating a gag order.

“Follow the water!”  The solar system is full of water in different states, from the Sun’s water vapor to the ice of Pluto and beyond. Water is not only linked to the possibility to sustain life, it is also interesting for its own geological properties and potential uses. For example, ice on the Moon and Mars could support human exploration. Comets that hit Earth may have deposited water on our planet.

## Intel unveils Lunar Lake architecture, moves RAM on-die

date: 2024-06-04, from: OS News

Hot on the heels of AMD, here&#8217;s Intel&#8217;s next-generation processor, this time for the laptop market. Overall, Lunar Lake represents their second generation of disaggregated SoC architecture for the mobile market, replacing the Meteor Lake architecture in the lower-end space. At this time, Intel has disclosed that it uses a 4P+4E (8 core) design, with hyper-threading/SMT disabled, so the total thread count supported by the processor is simply the number of CPU cores, e.g., 4P+4E/8T. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech The most significant change in Lunar Lake, however, has nothing to do with IPC improvements, core counts, or power usage. No, the massive sea change here is that Lunar Lake will do away with separate memory sticks, instead opting for on-die memory at a maximum of 32GB LPDDR5X. This is very similar to how Apple packages its memory on the M dies, and yes, this also means that as far as thin Intel laptops go, you&#8217;ll no longer be able to upgrade your memory after purchase. You choose your desired amount of memory at purchase, and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll be stuck with. Buyer beware, I suppose. We can only hope Intel isn&#8217;t going to default to 8GB.

## How Tony Stubblebine turned Medium around in the AI era

date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">
<p>This is a lovely piece about Tony Stubblebine, who, as it rightly says, is doing an excellent job as the new CEO of Medium.</p><blockquote><p>"Under Stubblebine’s direction, Medium, a site known for its many pivots, is finally being strategic about what it wants and where it’s headed. Last year, it launched a Mastodon server for premium users, and in March it demonetized AI-generated content on its platform. It is solidly on the side of team human and is finally starting to see that pay off."</p></blockquote><p>I worked at Medium in 2016-2017, and I've known Tony since 2007. I genuinely like Ev, too, but I think Tony was a fantastic choice of leader, and that's really bearing out in his choices over the last few years. I was particularly happy when Medium launched its own Mastodon instance to check out the network and help give it some cloud in certain circles.</p><blockquote><p>"It’s hard not to want to root for Medium. The assumption for more than a decade has been that the way the internet has to work will be determined by what makes the most money for a handful of companies. They wanted us to post content, then they wanted us to share content, then they wanted us to watch it endlessly, and now they want us to use their AI, which will create a bubble we’ll live in forever."</p></blockquote><p>I agree.</p>

## Many Americans still shying away from EVs despite Biden's push, poll finds

date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Many Americans still aren’t sold on going electric for their next car purchase. High prices and a lack of easy-to-find charging stations are major sticking points, a new poll shows.  


About 4 in 10 U.S. adults say they would be at least somewhat likely to buy an EV the next time they buy a car, according to the poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, while 46% say they are not too likely or not at all likely to purchase one.  


The poll results, which echo an AP-NORC poll from last year, show that President Joe Biden’s election-year plan to dramatically raise EV sales is running into resistance from American drivers. Only 13% of U.S. adults say they or someone in their household owns or leases a gas-hybrid car, and just 9% own or lease an electric vehicle.  


Caleb Jud of Cincinnati said he’s considering an EV, but may end up with a plug-in hybrid — if he goes electric. While Cincinnati winters aren’t extremely cold, “the thought of getting stuck in the driveway with an EV that won’t run is worrisome, and I know it wouldn’t be an issue with a plug-in hybrid,″ he said. Freezing temperatures can slow chemical reactions in EV batteries, depleting power and reducing driving range.


A new rule from the Environmental Protection Agency requires that about 56% of all new vehicle sales be electric by 2032, along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars. Auto companies are investing billions in factories and battery technology in an effort to speed up the switch to EVs to cut pollution, fight climate change — and meet the deadline.  


EVs are a key part of Biden’s climate agenda. Republicans led by presumptive nominee Donald Trump are turning it into a campaign issue.  


Younger people are more open to eventually purchasing an EV than older adults. More than half of those under 45 say they are at least “somewhat” likely to consider an EV purchase. About 32% of those over 45 are somewhat likely to buy an EV, the poll shows.  


But only 21% of U.S. adults say they are “very” or “extremely” likely to buy an EV for their next car, according to the poll, and 21% call it somewhat likely. Worries about cost are widespread, as are other practical concerns.  


Range anxiety – the idea that EVs cannot go far enough on a single charge and may leave a driver stranded — continues to be a major reason why many Americans do not purchase electric vehicles.  


About half of U.S. adults cite worries about range as a major reason not to buy an EV. About 4 in 10 say a major strike against EVs is that they take too long to charge or they don’t know of any public charging stations nearby.  


Concern about range is leading some to consider gas-engine hybrids, which allow driving even when the battery runs out. Jud, a 33-year-old operations specialist and political independent, said a hybrid "is more than enough for my about-town shopping, dropping my son off at school'' and other uses.  


With EV prices declining, cost would not be a factor, Jud said — a minority view among those polled. Nearly 6 in 10 adults cite cost as a major reason why they would not purchase an EV.  


Price is a bigger concern among older adults.  


The average price for a new EV was $52,314 in February, according to Kelley Blue Book. That's down by 12.8% from a year earlier, but still higher than the average price for all new vehicles of $47,244, the report said.


Jose Valdez of San Antonio owns three EVs, including a new Mustang Mach-E. With a tax credit and other incentives, the sleek new car cost about $49,000, Valdez said. He thinks it's well worth the money.  


"People think they cost an arm and a leg, but once they experience (driving) an EV, they'll have a different mindset,'' said Valdez, a retired state maintenance worker. 


The 45-year-old Republican said he does not believe in climate change. “I care more about saving green” dollars, he said, adding that he loves the EV's quiet ride and the fact he doesn't have to pay for gas or maintenance. EVs have fewer parts than gas-powered cars and generally cost less to maintain. Valdez installed his home charger himself for less than $700 and uses it for all three family cars, the Mustang and two older Ford hybrids.


With a recently purchased converter, he can also charge at a nearby Tesla supercharger station, Valdez said.  


About half of those who say they live in rural areas cite lack of charging infrastructure as a major factor in not buying an EV, compared with 4 in 10 of those living in urban communities.  


Daphne Boyd, of Ocala, Florida, has no interest in owning an EV. There are few public chargers near her rural home “and EVs don’t make any environmental sense,″ she said, citing precious metals that must be mined to make batteries, including in some countries that rely on child labor or other unsafe conditions. She also worries that heavy EV batteries increase wear-and-tear on tires and make the cars less efficient. Experts say extra battery weight can wear on tires but say proper maintenance and careful driving can extend tire life.  


Boyd, a 54-year-old Republican and self-described farm wife, said EVs may eventually make economic and environmental sense, but “they’re not where they need to be” to convince her to buy one now or in the immediate future.


Ruth Mitchell, a novelist from Eureka Springs, Arkansas, loves her EV. “It’s wonderful — quiet, great pickup, cheap to drive. I rave about it on Facebook,″ she said.


Mitchell, a 70-year-old Democrat, charges her Chevy Volt hybrid at home but says there are several public chargers near her house. She’s not looking for a new car, Mitchell said, but when she does it will be electric: "I won't drive anything else."

## UK broadcasters trade ad airtime for advertisers’ shares

date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">
<p>This is an interesting business model: UK broadcasters are trading unused ad space for equity in digital media startups, turning them into venture-scale investors.</p><blockquote><p>"The move comes as broadcasters continue to face a tough economic downturn where corporate clients have slashed spending on advertising – which is traditionally seen as a bellwether of the economic climate."</p></blockquote><p>The thing about venture investing is that it doesn't have a short time horizon: exits could easily be a decade away. So this is either a deliberately long game or a really short-sighted move on behalf of the broadcasters, who might not be prepared to hold a basket of liabilities for that long. Of course, they could presumably sell the equity, but that pressure on the secondary market would have the potential to drive the startups' share prices down. Really the broadcasters need to hold onto their portfolios.</p><p>I'm very curious to see how this plays out. It's definitely an innovative way to use an otherwise illiquid asset (unsold ad space). I want these broadcasters to survive, and I like the ecosystem-building aspect of this, so I hope it all works out for everyone involved.</p>

## Zoom CEO Eric Yuan wants AI clones in meetings

date: 2024-06-04, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">
<p>Eric Yuan has a really bizarre vision of what the future should look like:</p><blockquote><p>"Today for this session, ideally, I do not need to join. I can send a digital version of myself to join so I can go to the beach. Or I do not need to check my emails; the digital version of myself can read most of the emails. Maybe one or two emails will tell me, “Eric, it’s hard for the digital version to reply. Can you do that?” Again, today we all spend a lot of time either making phone calls, joining meetings, sending emails, deleting some spam emails and replying to some text messages, still very busy. How [do we] leverage AI, how do we leverage Zoom Workplace, to fully automate that kind of work? That’s something that is very important for us."</p></blockquote><p>The solution to having too many meetings that you don't really need to attend, and too many emails that are informational only, is to <em>not have the meetings and emails</em>. It's not to let AI do it for you, which in effect creates a world where our avatars are doing a bunch of makework drudgery for no reason.</p><p>Instead of building better business cultures and reinventing our work rhythms to adapt to information overload and an abundance of busywork, the vision here is to let the busywork happen between AI. It's an office full of ghosts, speaking to each other on our behalf, going to standup meetings with each other just because.</p><p>I mean, I get it. Meetings are Zoom's business. But count me out.</p>

## Summer Electricity Bills Are on the Rise

date: 2024-06-04, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM3NjIyMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NDEzMTM0OX0.UOcLqEo-U8hLxxdstl9jJYb-0jkX37MWkni2iLgARUE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Heat advisories are in effect across much of California • A large landslide buried cars in Taiwan • It is 70 degrees Fahrenheit and partly cloudy in Bonn, Germany, where delegates from 198 countries are gathering this week for the Bonn Climate Change Conference</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. IEA: World not on track to triple renewable capacity by 2030</h3><p>
	A new <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/cop28-tripling-renewable-capacity-pledge?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--wZLXGaJ3hCzK4l002UTW6vql--FLlUzRZT6DS9_aUAb87LavzTyRajIiKtNW3T9Nn7STW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from the International Energy Agency released this morning concluded that the world isn’t yet on track to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030 compared to 2022 levels – an ambitious goal set last year at COP28 in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. But we’re not hugely far off: In examining countries’ unofficial energy policies, the IEA found we’re likely to increase renewable capacity by about 8,000 gigawatts by 2030, which is about 70% of the 11,000 GW goal. But these policies aren’t set in stone. In fact, very few countries (just 14) have included clear 2030 renewable targets in their climate action plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The IEA wants countries to make these ambitions official when they revise those NDCs next year, but also urges them to move quickly on things like permitting and grid infrastructure expansion, and in general, aim higher. “The tripling target is ambitious but achievable – though only if governments quickly turn promises into plans of action,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol.
</p><h3>2. U.S. energy bills expected to rise 8% this summer </h3><p>
	U.S. household electricity bills are projected to rise by 8% on average this summer compared to last year, <a href="https://neada.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/2024summeroutlook.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--wZLXGaJ3hCzK4l002UTW6vql--FLlUzRZT6DS9_aUAb87LavzTyRajIiKtNW3T9Nn7STW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to analysis</a> from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association and the Center for Energy Poverty, and Climate. Costs are going up everywhere as Americans rely heavily on air conditioning to stay cool during intense heat. Here’s a look at expected summer electric bills across the country:
</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="abc9957f4d74f9b32518e8030bcd2f69" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="53737" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM3NjIzMy9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NTU0NTk5MH0.ZEjLAqLwHz3f4PGOnQ8N3cOuuCN4HfIbYOyF39jvWiM/image.png?width=980"/>
<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">NEADA and CEPC</small>
</p><p>
	The report finds that “due to the unprecedented rise in summer temperatures and higher rates of extreme heat events,” summer energy bills have risen from an average cost of $476 in 2014 to a projected $719 this year. Low-income households will feel this financial strain the most because they spend a larger amount of their income (about 8%) on energy. Startlingly, the survey found that the percentage of customers that couldn’t pay their energy bills for one month or longer jumped from 21.3% to 23.5% last year, which saw the hottest summer on record. The largest increase was among households with children. The report calls for more efforts to ensure houses are weatherized, and installing heat pumps.
</p><h3>3. Researchers say climate change made Brazil floods more likely</h3><p>
	The recent floods in southern Brazil, which have killed more than 170 people and displaced nearly 600,000, were made about <a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/climate-change-made-the-floods-in-southern-brazil-twice-as-likely/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--wZLXGaJ3hCzK4l002UTW6vql--FLlUzRZT6DS9_aUAb87LavzTyRajIiKtNW3T9Nn7STW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">twice as likely</a> by human-induced climate change, according to an international group of researchers. The analysis from the World Weather Attribution also said the El Niño weather pattern played a big role in the disaster, increasing the risk by nearly five times and making rainfall between 3% and 10% more intense. Meanwhile, a bit farther north in Brazil’s “citrus belt,” orange growers are seeing a significant drop in crop production thanks in part to severe weather such as drought, disease, and pests. One research group is <a href="https://www.fundecitrus.com.br/pdf/pes_relatorios/2024_05_10_Tree_Inventory_and_Orange_Crop_Forecast_2024-2025.pdf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--wZLXGaJ3hCzK4l002UTW6vql--FLlUzRZT6DS9_aUAb87LavzTyRajIiKtNW3T9Nn7STW" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forecasting</a> that the 2024-25 season could see production drop by a quarter. Brazil is the world’s top orange producer and exporter.

## US farmers opt for soy to limit losses as all crop prices slump

date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA

Chicago — Mark Tuttle planted more soy and less corn on his northern Illinois farm this spring as prices for both crops hover near three-year lows and soybeans' lower production costs offered him the best chance of turning a profit in the country's top soy producing state.


He even planted soybeans in one of his fields for a second straight year, breaking the traditional soy-corn-soy rotation for field management. He and many other farmers are hoping to just minimize losses.


Planting more soy at a time of sputtering demand from importers and domestic processors will only serve to drive prices lower, further swell historically large global supplies and erode U.S. farm incomes already poised for the steepest annual drop ever in dollar terms.


But Midwest farmers' other main options — seeding more corn or leaving fields fallow — could have resulted in even wider losses.


"There's a better chance of making money with soybeans than there is for corn right now," Tuttle said. "But if we have another bigger crop, prices are going to go lower and that's not going to bode well for the farmer."


In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast farmers would plant 86.5 million acres of soybeans nationwide this spring, the fifth most ever. Some analysts expect soybean acres to increase by another million acres or more as heavy rains close the window on corn planting.


In nearby Princeton, Illinois, Evan Hultine also increased soy plantings and scaled back corn. High production costs due in part to a jump in interest rates looked likely to erode most or all of his corn returns, while soybeans remained marginally profitable, he said.


The farm's profits will likely be the thinnest in at least five years, Hultine said.


In an annual early season crop budget estimate, University of Illinois agricultural economists projected negative average farmer returns in the state for both crops, though losses would be smaller for soybeans.


Unprofitable crops 


In northern Illinois, farmers could lose $140 per acre on average for corn and $30 an acre for soybeans with autumn delivery prices of $4.50 and $11.50 a bushel, respectively, the analysis showed. Actual returns vary significantly from farm to farm, however, depending on factors like crop yields, the timing of grain sales and whether farmers own or rent their land.


Fertilizer costs are down from highs last year, but crop prices are also down, while land costs remain elevated and borrowing rates for operating loans and equipment have jumped, likely forcing farmers to cut expenses, the economists said.


When looking to cut costs, farmers often favor planting soybeans rather than corn because they require less fertilizer and pesticides and seed costs tend to be lower.


High interest rates have been a particularly painful expense recently.


"If you're borrowing $700 an acre to put a corn crop in at 7% to 8%, you're talking about some real dollars there just on the price of money. You can put a bean crop in a lot cheaper. Your interest cost per acre might be half," Tuttle said.


More soy, less corn


An early-spring forecast from the USDA projected soy plantings would expand by 3.5% this year while corn plantings were expected to shrink 4.9%.


The expansion is expected to swell the U.S. soy stockpile next season by more than 30% to the highest in five years and the sixth highest level on record as demand from the domestic and export markets is not keeping pace with rising production, according to the USDA.


Now, rain-saturated fields in some areas could clip corn acres and even further expand seedings of soybeans, which, unlike corn, can be planted well into June without significant risk to yields.


Cash prices offered for the next corn and soybean harvest have improved from earlier this spring in Spencer, Iowa, where Brent Swart has been struggling to plant the last of his corn acres due to overly wet weather. But neither crop pencils a profit at current prices.


Nearly a foot of rain over the past month, seven inches more than normal, has left his fields too soggy for field work. Swart estimates his remaining corn fields may not be in shape to plant until after his planting deadline date of June 1, when crop insurance benefits begin to drop with each day.


Swart's best option in some of his fields may be to file an insurance claim saying he was prevented from planting due to waterlogged soils. Soybean prices remain some 40 cents a bushel under his estimated cost of production, he said.


"If you switch to soybeans, you're potentially looking at a loss. If you prevent plant, you're looking at more of a breakeven scenario," Swart said.


Only farmers with severe weather issues will be able to file for insurance, however.


Weather delays and a favorable price versus corn could boost soy plantings by 500,000 to 1 million acres above the USDA's latest forecast for 86.5 million, said Tanner Ehmke, lead economist for grains and oilseeds at CoBank.


"The signal from the marketplace to the farmer right now is that, if you have a doubt about your acreage, send those acres to soybeans," he said.

## A Critical Mineral Trade War Is Brewing

date: 2024-06-04, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjMwNDAzMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3Nzg2MDMxM30.vVkI9YPrj5hXyZuvagYWjyhU-H0EyavuD11aGJcVALg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	China and the United States have fired their opening salvos in a critical minerals trade war. Over the past year, China has imposed export controls on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-export-curbs-choke-off-shipments-gallium-germanium-second-month-2023-10-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gallium</u></a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-export-curbs-choke-off-shipments-gallium-germanium-second-month-2023-10-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>germanium</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-require-export-permits-some-graphite-products-dec-1-2023-10-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>graphite</u></a> — all minerals necessary for energy transition technologies. Then in May, the Biden Administration shot back with tariffs on critical mineral <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/what-are-bidens-new-tariffs-china-goods-2024-05-14/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>imports</u></a>, part of a package of trade protection measures to help shield domestic manufacturers in strategic sectors, including the mineral industry. The downstream consequence for energy transition technologies such as electric vehicle batteries, however, is almost certainly higher prices.
</p><p>
	In all likelihood, this critical mineral trade war will intensify, with corresponding implications for U.S. industries that use these raw materials. China’s next shot <a href="https://rhg.com/research/us-china-trade-war-volume-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may</u></a> be even tighter export controls on critical minerals, including minerals for which the United States relies heavily on China. Such export controls pose real — and serious — risks to downstream U.S. industries for five key reasons.
</p><h3>1. Critical minerals underpin billions of dollars of U.S. economic activity. </h3><p>
<strong></strong>For example, the White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/100-day-supply-chain-review-report.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>assesses</u></a> that U.S. consumption of rare earth elements worth $613 million affects about $496 billion in downstream economic activity across core sectors, from petroleum refining to automotive manufacturing. Critically, the United States relies on China for <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-rare-earths.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nearly 70% </u></a>of its rare earth consumption. The United States also depends substantially on China for other minerals — more than on any other country. Of the 50 non-fuel mineral commodities for which the United States relied on imports to meet more than 50% of its consumption from 2019 to 2022, <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>China</u></a> was the leading import source for 15. Because critical minerals are necessary in applications affecting strategic sectors such as automotive manufacturing and renewable energy, Chinese export controls would be particularly disruptive and costly.
</p><h3>2. It would be tough — if not impossible — for the U.S. to find other sources for the volume of Chinese-produced minerals it consumes. </h3><p>
<strong></strong>To illustrate, the United States does not produce any arsenic metal, which is used to produce <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-arsenic.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gallium arsenide semiconductors</u></a> for <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-gallium.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>high-performance electronics</u></a>. China supplied <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-arsenic.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>97%</u></a> of America’s arsenic metal imports in 2022. If China were to restrict arsenic metal exports to the United States, American manufacturers — including semiconductor fabricators, which the Biden administration very much wants to support — would likely struggle to find non-Chinese suppliers able to meet their full needs. Multiply this across all of the <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many, many minerals</u></a> China supplies to the U.S., and you get a major problem.
</p><h3>3. Even if U.S. companies can source critical minerals outside China, they’re probably still controlled by Chinese companies. </h3><p>
	For instance, Chinese companies have significant stakes in cobalt reserves and production in the <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-cobalt.pdf" target="_blank"><u>Democratic Republic of the Congo</u></a>, the world’s largest holder of cobalt reserves and producer of cobalt ore. There, the Chinese company CMOC owns the Kisanfu project, which calls itself one of the world’s “<a href="https://en.cmoc.com/html/2022/News_0701/60.html" target="_blank"><u>largest and highest-grade undeveloped copper-cobalt projects</u></a>,” and Chinese companies owned or financed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/20/world/china-congo-cobalt.html" target="_blank"><u>15</u></a> of the 19 cobalt-producing mines there as of 2020. Depending on the extent to which the Chinese government requires overseas Chinese companies’ <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-export-control-law-explainer-china-briefing-news/#:~:text=The%20ECL%20also%20extends%20Chinese,to%20its%20export%20control%20provisions" target="_blank"><u>help enforcing</u></a> mineral export controls, downstream U.S. industries could be prevented from sourcing minerals produced by Chinese companies outside China.
</p><h3>4. Higher global mineral prices <em>could</em> spur non-Chinese producers to enter the mineral market — but these new entrants may struggle in the long term. </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Plenty of new companies entered the rare earth industry after China reduced export quotas and caused <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html" target="_blank"><u>record-high rare earth prices</u></a> in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-07-09/china-reduces-rare-earth-export-quota-by-72-in-second-half-lynas-says?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2010</u></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rareearth/china-cuts-rare-earth-export-quotas-u-s-concerned-idUSTRE6BR0KX20101228" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2011</u></a>. But when prices fell in 2015 due to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2015/02/25/169038/what-happened-to-the-rare-earths-crisis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lower-than-expected demand</u></a>, many of these rare earth companies went <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bankruptcy-molycorp/rare-earth-miner-molycorp-to-start-bankruptcy-sale-of-business-idUSKBN0UM2A820160108/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bankrupt</u></a>. Ultimately, the success rate for rare earth projects entering production between 2011 and 2021 was just <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169136823001439" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>1.5%</u></a>. Non-Chinese mineral producers may find it attractive to enter the market amid artificially inflated prices from export controls, but whether their business model will hold if and when prices fall again is decidedly less sure. Importantly, China’s commanding production share for many critical minerals enables it to influence global prices in its favor. If a new global industry begins to flourish, a glut of cheap Chinese minerals may not be far behind.
</p><h3>5. Non-Chinese mineral producers could face capital and technical challenges ramping up production. </h3><p>
	Mines and refineries already operating near their maximum capacity would have to invest millions or <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/glencore-plans-15-bln-investment-expand-peru-copper-mine-2023-05-30/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>billions</u></a> of dollars to expand production capacity, which can take up to <a href="https://www.mining.com/barrick-to-invest-2-billion-in-zambia-copper-mine-expansion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>five years</u></a> from starting feasibility studies to commissioning new production. For mines and refineries with the capacity to ramp up production already available, that excess margin could be due to long-standing <a href="https://gigametals.com/site/assets/files/4861/2018-03-19-hpal.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>technical issues</u></a> in processes like <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/blogs/metals/030321-nickel-hpal-technology-ev-batteries-emissions-environment-mining" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>adjusting the temperature</u></a> during processing. Thus, non-Chinese mineral supply may take some time — and a lot of money — to come online if China imposes export controls.
</p><p>
	The Chinese government has both the will and the capability to impose mineral export controls — as evidenced by its prior and present use of mineral trade restrictions, from banning exports of rare earth elements to Japan in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2010</u></a> to imposing a blanket export ban on rare earth processing technology in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-bans-export-rare-earths-processing-technologies-2023-12-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2023</u></a>. As U.S.-China competition intensifies, more Chinese export controls on minerals could well follow, which would cause severe supply chain disruptions given challenges sourcing sufficient non-Chinese mineral supplies.
</p><p>
	So, while it remains to be seen how China will retaliate to this new round of U.S. mineral tariffs, the U.S. government should accelerate its mineral stockpiling — including urging certain downstream U.S. industries to stockpile — and its collaboration with partner countries to improve the resilience and robustness of their mineral supply chains. The U.S. government should tread carefully in deploying trade tools in this critical minerals competition, and prepare accordingly for possible Chinese responses.

## Muslim drift to Republican Party stalls amid Gaza conflict

date: 2024-06-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The war in Gaza is shaking Muslim Americans’ political loyalties ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.


Disenchanted by President Joe Biden’s embrace of Israel, many Democratic-leaning Muslims who once backed him are now vowing to withdraw their endorsement.


But it’s not just Muslim Democrats abandoning their once-preferred candidate. Some Muslim Republicans are also wavering amidst their own party's support of Israel.


Mo Nehad, a Pakistani American Republican activist in Fort Bend County, Texas, has seen up close the political effects of the Gaza conflict on Muslim American voting.


In late 2020, Nehad, who is a small-business owner, police officer and military warrant officer, helped found a grassroots group in a bid to engage the local Muslim community with the Republican Party.


Initially focused on opposition to COVID-19 vaccine mandates and mask mandates, the group, called Muslim Americans of Texas, soon found a new cause: a conservative backlash to sex and gender education policies in local schools.


"We were essentially trying to tell the Muslim community, regardless of what has happened in the past overseas, let's focus on national topics and events," Nehad said in an interview. “And when you compare what traditionally a Democratic-elected president has done and a Republican-elected president has done [on national issues], a Republican-elected president is much better for the Muslims.”


The advocacy paid off, he said. While the Fort Bend County Muslim community remained solidly Democratic, a small number started crossing party lines, mirroring a pattern seen across the country.


"These are people who go to the same masjid as I do, people who are in the same home-school groups," he said.


Then the war in Gaza broke out after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, testing the political allegiance of Muslim Democrats and Republicans alike, with both viewing their parties as equally pro-Israel.


Many Muslim Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Biden in 2020 fumed over the president’s support for an Israeli military campaign that has killed more than 30,000 Palestinians.




Earlier this year, a group of progressive Muslim activists launched a campaign they labeled #AbandonBiden, inducing hundreds of thousands of voters to vote “uncommitted” in key Democratic primaries in Michigan and elsewhere. Members were also threatening not to vote for Biden in November.


Republican-leaning Muslims, fewer in number, have not been as vocal. While many are backing their party, its equally staunch support of Israel has alienated some, according to Muslim activists and experts.


Nehad said that while he intends to vote for former President Donald Trump in November, some Republican Muslims are reconsidering their stance and even “going back” to the Democratic Party, drawn by that party’s stronger criticism of Israeli actions.


“They don’t want to vote for Republican candidates because the Republican candidates do not want to go ahead and openly denounce what Israel is doing,” Nehad said.


Drift to GOP stalls


Youssef Chouhoud, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, said the war in Gaza appears to have paused if not blunted the recent Muslim drift to the GOP.


Had the war not occurred, he said that as many as 40% of Muslim Americans would have voted for the Republican presidential nominee in November.


“I was fully expecting that,” Chouhoud, who studies Muslim American voting behavior, said.


Now, he said he is not so sure.


“I wouldn’t be surprised if upwards of 40% are voting third party or otherwise testing some vote that is not a two-party vote,” he said.


A recent poll by the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee and The Truth Project showed that only 7% of Arab American voters plan to vote for Biden and 2% for Trump, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein receiving 25%.


How the Muslim vote will influence the outcome of the presidential contest between Biden and Trump remains uncertain.


Numbering about 3.5 million, Muslims make up just 1% of the U.S. population. In tight races in swing states with large Muslim populations, though, their vote could potentially sway the outcome of the election.


But American Muslims are a diverse lot, with interests and priorities often as varied as the general electorate. While anger over the Gaza conflict may have unified the community, it is not the only issue driving their voting decision, said Saher Selod, director of research for the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a Muslim American research group in Dearborn, Michigan.


“We need to know if [some Muslim voters] are centering this issue as a major driving force in terms of how they're going to vote," Selod said in an interview. "Other groups, while they might support a cease-fire, have other issues that that they're going to vote on."


VOA asked both the Biden and Trump campaigns about their outreach to Muslim Americans and any steps to assuage their concerns over the Gaza war.


In a statement, a Biden campaign spokesperson said, “The President shares the goal of a just and lasting peace in the region. He’s working tirelessly to that end.”


In a separate statement, the campaign’s Michigan director said the Biden team is in contact with Arab American and Muslim groups in Detroit and Dearborn. Both cities have large Muslim populations.


The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The campaign has not publicly reached out to the Muslim community on the war in Gaza, but Trump’s son-in-law, Michael Boulos, and a former Trump administration official recently met with a group of Arab Americans and Middle Eastern leaders in Michigan.


Historical patterns


Historically, Muslim American voters have oscillated between the two major political parties. Socially conservative, most voted Republican in the 1980s and 1990s, leading some party activists to hail them as “natural” allies. In 2000, a majority backed Republican George W. Bush.


That changed after the attacks of Sept. 11, as the Bush administration’s increased scrutiny of the community amid its “war on terror” sent Muslims flocking to the Democratic Party. In every presidential election since 2004, Muslims have favored the Democratic nominee.


But with memories of 9/11 fading in recent years, some Muslims began to shift back to the Republican Party, driven by shared conservative values such as opposition to abortion, gay marriage and LGBTQ-inclusive policies in schools.


"This is the social conservatism within this community kind of creeping up to the surface and guiding political decisions in light of a lot of marquee policy debates," Chouhoud said.


Some polls confirm this recent voting trend.


In October 2020, an Institute for Social Policy and Understanding poll found 30% of Muslims approved of Trump's job performance, up from 13% in 2018. 


In November 2020, an Associated Press exit poll found that 64% supported Biden and 35% backed Trump.


Other polls showed a more modest increase in Muslim support for Trump.


Muslim support for Republican candidates continued into 2022. During that year's midterm elections, 28% of Muslims voted Republican, up from 17% during the 2018 midterms, while 70% voted Democratic, down from 81%.


Today, the Muslim voter base is firmly rooted in the Democratic Party, though a significant slice leans Republican.


A recent Pew Research poll found that 66% of Muslim voters are Democrats or lean Democratic, while 32% are Republicans or lean Republican.


Three previous polls conducted by Pew had all shown lower-level numbers of Republican or Republican-leaning Muslim voters, according to Besheer Mohamed, a senior Pew researcher.


“There are certain issues where Muslims tend to align more with the Republican Party, Mohamed said, noting positive views of religion and skepticisms toward LGBTQ issues.  “Then there are other issues where that’s not the case.”


Nehad, once an independent voter, is now a Republican. His political pivot came after he ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for constable where he said he felt pressured to champion policies that clashed with his religious convictions.


This year, he stood as a Republican candidate for Fort Bend County sheriff.


“Everything the Republican Party stands for, 70% of it aligns with my beliefs and values,” Nehad said, in a drawl honed over more than 25 years of living in the Lone Star state. “But when I compare the same with the Democratic Party, it’s only maybe 20 or 40%, if that.”


Zahoor Gire, another co-founder of the Muslim Americans of Texas, said Muslim Americans “share conservative Republican values” such as strong families, traditional marriage, traditional gender roles and opposition to abortion.


“I had family members of my own that had voted Democratic before and are now voting Republican,” Gire said.


Underscoring the renewed Muslim embrace of the Republican Party, he said a record eight Republican Muslim candidates have run for office in Texas this year.


“So that shows you the willingness of people to embrace this party and then run for office through this party’s platform,” Gire said.


To many Muslim Republicans, Trump is not the anti-Muslim politician as he is seen by others. They’ve defended his so-called “Muslim ban” as a necessary national security measure rather than a religiously motivated injunction.


But the Gaza war has become “the main issue” for Muslims in America, Gire said. And with Trump urging Israel earlier this year to “finish what they started,” his perceived support of Israel at the expense of Palestinians is giving some Muslim Republicans pause.


Asked if he will support Trump in November, Gire said, "We need to see very specifically what his foreign policies will be, what his stance towards Muslim Americans will be.”

## Rebalancing our REST API traffic

date: 2024-06-04, from: Crossref Blog

<p>Since we first launched our REST API around 2013 as a Labs project, it has evolved well beyond a prototype into arguably Crossref’s most visible and valuable service. It is the result of 20,000 organisations around the world that have worked for many years to curate and share metadata about their various resources, from research grants to research articles and other component inputs and outputs of research.</p>
<p>The REST API is relied on by a large part of the research information community and beyond, seeing around 1.8 billion requests each month. Just five years ago, that average monthly number was 600 million. Our members are the heaviest users, using it for all kinds of information about their own records or picking up connections like citations and other relationships. Databases, discovery tools, libraries, and governments all use the API. Research groups use it for all sorts of things such as analysing trends in science or recording retractions and corrections.</p>
<p>So the chances are high that almost any tool you rely on in scientific research has somewhere incorporated metadata through us.</p>
<h2 id="optimising-performance">Optimising performance</h2>
<p>For some time, we’ve been noticing reduced performance in a number of ways, and periodically we have a flurry of manually blocking/unblocking IP addresses from requesters that are hammering and degrading the service for everyone else, and this is of course only minimally effective and very short term. You can always watch out status page for alerts. This is the current one about REST API performance: <a href="https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv" target="_blank">https://status.crossref.org/incidents/d7k4ml9vvswv</a>.</p>
<p>As the number of users and requests has grown, our strategies for serving those requests must evolve. This post discusses how we’re approaching balancing the growth in usage for the immediate term and provides some thoughts about things we could try in the future on which we’ll update gladly take feedback and advice.</p>
<h3 id="load-balancing">Load balancing</h3>
<p>In 2018, we started routing users through three different pools (<em>public</em>, <em>polite</em>, and <em>plus</em>). This coincided with the launch of <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/metadata-retrieval/metadata-plus">Metadata Plus</a>, a paid-for service with monthly data dumps and very high rate limits. Note that all metadata is exactly the same and real-time across all pools. We also, more recently, introduced an <em>internal</em> pool. Here&rsquo;s more about them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Plus</em>: This is the aforementioned premium option; it’s really for ‘enterprise-wide’ use in production services and is not really relevant here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Public</em>: This is the default and is the one that is struggling at the moment. You don’t have to identify yourself and, in theory, we don’t have to work through the night to support it if it’s struggling (although we often do). <em>Public</em> currently receives around <strong>30,000</strong> requests per minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Polite</em>: Traffic is routed to <em>polite</em> simply by detecting a mailto in the header. Any system or person including an email is being routed to a currently-quieter pool, this means we can always get in touch for troubleshooting (and only troubleshooting). <em>Polite</em> currently receives around <strong>5,000</strong> requests per minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Internal</em>: In 2021, we introduced a new pool just for our own tools where we can control and predict the traffic. <em>Internal</em> currently receives around <strong>1,000</strong> requests per minute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The volumes of traffic across <em>public</em>, <em>polite</em> and <em>internal</em> pools are very different and yet each pool has always had similar resources. The purpose of each of these pools has been long-established but our efforts to ask the community to use <em>polite</em> by default have not been particularly successful and it is clear that we don’t have the right balance.</p>
<p>The <em>internal</em> pool has been dedicated to our internal services that have predictable usage and that have requests that are not initiated by external users. The <em>internal</em> pool has arbitrarily included reference matching but not Crossmark, Event Data, or search.crossref.org, which all use the <em>polite</em> pool instead, along with the community. We have the capacity on the <em>internal</em> pool to shift all of this “internal” traffic across, and in doing so we will create more capacity for genuine <em>polite</em> users and redefine what we consider to be “internal”.</p>
<p>Creating more capacity on <em>polite</em> will also give us the opportunity to load-balance requests to both <em>polite</em> and <em>public</em> across the two pools. We are at a point where we cannot eke more performance out of the API without architectural changes. In order to buy ourselves time to address this properly, we will modify the routing of <em>polite</em> and <em>public</em> and evenly distribute requests to the two pools 50/50.</p>
<p>The <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> pools have equal resources at the moment yet handle very different volumes of traffic (30,000 req/min vs 5,000 req/min), and with the proposed changes to internal traffic the <em>polite</em> pool would handle a fraction of this. The result would look something like 31,000 req/min evenly distributed across <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em>.</p>
<h3 id="rate-limiting">Rate limiting</h3>
<p>Our rate-limiting also needs review. We track a number of metrics in our web proxy but only deny requests on one of them - the number of requests per second. On <em>public</em> and <em>polite</em> we limit each IP address to sending 50 req/sec and if this rate is exceeded users are denied access for 10 seconds. These limits are generous and we cannot realistically support this volume of request for all users of the <em>public</em> or <em>polite</em> API.</p>
<p>However, when requests are taking a long time to return, we potentially have a separate problem of high concurrency as hundreds of requests could be sent before the first one has returned. We intend to identify and impose an appropriate rate limit on concurrent requests from each IP to prevent a small number of users from disproportionately affecting all users with long-running queries.</p>
<h3 id="longer-term">Longer-term</h3>
<p>So, in the short-term we will revise our pool traffic as described above. We’ll do that this week. Then we will review the current rate limits and reduce them to something more reasonable for the majority of users. And we’ll identify and introduce a rate limit for concurrent requests from each user.</p>
<p>Longer-term, we need to rearchitect our Elasticsearch pools so that we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce shard sizes to improve performance of queries</li>
<li>Balance data shards and replicas more evenly</li>
<li>Optimise our instance types for our workload</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="want-to-help">Want to help?</h2>
<p>Thanks for asking!</p>
<p>Firstly, please, everyone, do always put an email in your API request headers - while the short term plan will help stabilise performance, this habit will always help us troubleshoot e.g. we can always contact you instead of blocking you!</p>
<p>Secondly, we know many of you incorporate Crossref metadata, add lots of value to it in order to deliver important services, and also develop APIs of your own. We’d love any comments or recommendations from those of you handling similar situations on scaling and optimising API performance. You can comment on this post which is managed via our Discourse forum. We’ll aslo be adding updates to this thread as well as on status.crossref.org. If you’d like to be in touch with any of us directly, all our emails are <a href="mailto:firstinitiallastname@crossref.org">firstinitiallastname@crossref.org</a>.</p>

## Fauci deflects partisan attacks in fiery House hearing over COVID

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert until leaving the government in 2022, was back before Congress on Monday, calling Republican allegations that he'd tried to cover up origins of the COVID-19 pandemic “simply preposterous.” 


A GOP-led subcommittee has spent over a year probing the nation's response to the pandemic and whether U.S.-funded research in China may have played any role in how it started — yet found no evidence linking Fauci to wrongdoing. 


He'd already been grilled behind closed doors, for 14 hours over two days in January. But Monday, Fauci testified voluntarily in public and on camera at a hearing that quickly deteriorated into partisan attacks. 


Republicans repeated unproven accusations against the longtime National Institutes of Health scientist while Democrats apologized for Congress besmirching his name and bemoaned a missed opportunity to prepare for the next scary outbreak. 


“He is not a comic book super villain,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, adding that the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic had failed to prove a list of damaging allegations. 


Fauci was the public face of the government's early COVID-19 response under then-President Donald Trump and later as an adviser to President Joe Biden. A trusted voice to millions, he also was the target of partisan anger and choked up Monday as he recalled death threats and other harassment of himself and his family, the threats he said continue. Police later escorted hecklers out of the hearing room. 




The main issue: Many scientists believe the virus most likely emerged in nature and jumped from animals to people, probably at a wildlife market in Wuhan, the city in China where the outbreak began. There’s no new scientific information supporting that the virus might instead have leaked from a laboratory. A U.S. intelligence analysis says there’s insufficient evidence to prove either way — and a recent Associated Press investigation found the Chinese government froze critical efforts to trace the source of the virus in the first weeks of the outbreak. 


Fauci has long said publicly that he was open to both theories but that there’s more evidence supporting COVID-19’s natural origins, the way other deadly viruses including coronavirus cousins SARS and MERS jumped into people. It was a position he repeated Monday as Republican lawmakers questioned if he worked behind-the-scenes to squelch the lab-leak theory or even tried to influence intelligence agencies. 


“I have repeatedly stated that I have a completely open mind to either possibility and that if definitive evidence becomes available to validate or refute either theory, I will readily accept it,” Fauci said. He later invoked a fictional secret agent, decrying a conspiracy theory that “I was parachuting into the CIA like Jason Bourne and told the CIA that they should really not be talking about a lab leak.” 


Republicans also have accused Fauci of lying to Congress in denying that his agency funded “gain of function” research — the practice of enhancing a virus in a lab to study its potential real-world impact — at a lab in Wuhan. 


NIH for years gave grants to a New York nonprofit called EcoHealth Alliance that used some of the funds to work with a Chinese lab studying coronaviruses commonly carried by bats. Last month, the government suspended EcoHealth's federal funding, citing its failure to properly monitor some of those experiments. 


The definition of “gain of function” covers both general research and especially risky experiments to “enhance” the ability of potentially pandemic pathogens to spread or cause severe disease in humans. Fauci stressed he was using the risky experiment definition, saying "it would be molecularly impossible” for the bat viruses studied with EcoHealth’s funds to be turned into the virus that caused the pandemic. 


In an exchange with Rep. H. Morgan Griffith, a Republican from Virginia, Fauci acknowledged that the lab leak is still an open question since it's impossible to know if some other lab, not funded by NIH money, was doing risky research with coronaviruses. 


Fauci did face a new set of questions about the credibility of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which he led for 38 years. Last month, the House panel revealed emails from an NIAID colleague about ways to evade public records laws, including by not discussing controversial pandemic issues in government email. 


Fauci denounced the actions of that colleague and insisted that “to the best of my knowledge I have never conducted official business via my personal email.” 




The pandemic's origins weren't the only hot topic. The House panel also blasted some public health measures taken to slow spread of the virus before COVID-19 vaccines, spurred by NIAID research, helped allow a return to normalcy. Ordering people to stay 6 feet apart meant many businesses, schools and churches couldn't stay open, and subcommittee chairman Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a Republican from Ohio, called it a “burdensome” and arbitrary rule, noting that in his prior closed-door testimony Fauci had acknowledged it wasn't scientifically backed. 


Fauci responded Monday that the 6-feet distancing wasn't his guideline but one created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before scientists had learned that the new virus was airborne, not spread simply by droplets emitted a certain distance.

## UN Security Council to discuss North Korea human rights

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

united nations — The U.N. Security Council will hold a public meeting in mid-June on human rights in North Korea while South Korea holds the council’s rotating presidency.


“Some countries have some reservations about human rights issues being discussed in the Security Council,” South Korean Ambassador Hwang Joon-kook said in announcing the session on Monday. “We know their logic.”


Countries including Russia and China oppose human rights issues being discussed in the 15-nation council, which is tasked with maintaining international peace and security. They, and other like-minded countries, argue that human rights issues should be handled in designated U.N. fora, such as the Geneva-based Human Rights Council or the General Assembly committee that deals with rights issues.


They could call for a procedural vote to try to block the meeting, in which case at least nine of the council’s 15 members would need to support the session.


Hwang told reporters at a news conference launching Seoul's June presidency that unlike other countries, North Korea’s human rights situation is part of the council’s official agenda.


“This is unique to North Korea, and there are some good reasons for it,” he said. The “DPRK human rights and humanitarian situation is closely interlinked with North Korea’s aggressive weapons — their aggressive WMD [weapons of mass destruction] and nuclear development.”


DPRK is the abbreviation for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.


The council was last publicly briefed on the issue on August 17, 2023, by U.N. Human Rights chief Volker Türk, who said that many of the severe and widespread rights violations in North Korea are directly linked to the regime’s pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile technology.


In 2014, a U.N. Commission of Inquiry found that North Korea’s rights violations had risen to the level of crimes against humanity and included murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape and enforced disappearance, among other crimes.


Relations between Seoul and Pyongyang have deteriorated in recent months. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has said he has given up on reunification with the South and designated it a foreign enemy state. He has also enshrined the country’s illicit nuclear program into its constitution.


Washington says North Korea is advancing its prohibited weapons program “at an alarming rate” and has launched more than 100 ballistic missiles since the beginning of 2022.


And in one of its more bizarre actions, last week Pyongyang sent balloons filled with trash and feces into the skies over South Korea, dropping them on busy streets.


Fed up, South Korea said Monday it will fully suspend a 2018 military agreement with the North that is aimed at lowering tensions. Seoul partially suspended the agreement last November to protest the launch of a North Korean spy satellite.

## Andreas Kling steps down from SerenityOS to focus entirely on the Ladybird browser

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

We&#8217;ve got some possibly sad, possibly great news. Today, Andreas Kling, the amazing developer who started SerenityOS as a way to regain a sense or normalcy after completing his drug rehab program, has announced he&#8217;s stepping down as the &#8216;big dictator for life&#8217; of the SerenityOS project, handing leadership over the maintainer group. The other half of the coin, however, is that Kling will officially fork Ladybird, the cross-platform web browser that originated as part of SerenityOS, turning it into a proper, separate project. Personally, for the past two years, I&#8217;ve been almost entirely focused on Ladybird, a new web browser that started as a simple HTML viewer for SerenityOS. When Ladybird became a cross-platform project in 2022, I switched all my attention to the Linux version, as testing on Linux was much easier and didn&#8217;t require booting into SerenityOS. Time flew by, and now I can&#8217;t remember the last time I worked on something in SerenityOS that wasn&#8217;t related to Ladybird. ↫ Andreas Kling If you know a little bit about Kling&#8217;s career, it&#8217;s not entirely surprising that his heart lies with working on a browser engine. He originally worked at Nokia, and then at Apple in San Francisco on WebKit, and there&#8217;s most likely some code that he&#8217;s written in the browser you&#8217;re using right now (except, perhaps, for us Firefox users). As such, it makes sense that once Ladybird grew into something more than just a simple HTML viewer, he&#8217;d be focusing on it a lot. As part of the fork, Ladybird will focus entirely on Linux and macOS, and drop SerenityOS as a target. This may seem weird at first, but this is an entirely amicable and planned step, as this allows Ladybird to adopt, use, and integrate third party code, something SerenityOS does not allow. In addition, many of these open source projects Ladybird couldn&#8217;t really use anyway because they simply didn&#8217;t exist for SerenityOS in the first place. This decision creates a lot of breathing room and flexibility for both projects. Ladybird was getting a lot of attention from outside of SerenityOS circles, from large donations to code contributions. I&#8217;m not entirely surprised by this step, and I really hope it&#8217;s going to be the beginning of something great. We really need new and competitive browser engines to push the web forward, and alongside Servo, it now seems Ladybird has also picked up the baton. What this will mean for SerenityOS remains to be seen. As Kling said, he hasn&#8217;t really been involved with SerenityOS outside of Ladybird work for two years now, so it seems the rest of the contributors were already doing a lot of the heavy lifting. I hope this doesn&#8217;t mean the project will peter out, since it has a certain flair few other operating systems have.

## Iran's top diplomat confirms talks with US

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

Beirut, Lebanon — Iran's acting foreign minister Ali Bagheri said Monday his government was engaged in negotiations with arch-foe the United States hosted by the Gulf sultanate of Oman. 


Asked about the issue at a news conference during a visit to Beirut, Bagheri said, "we have always continued our negotiations ... and they have never stopped." 


Washington and Tehran have not had diplomatic relations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran. 


The British daily Financial Times reported in March that Bagheri was involved in indirect talks with the United States in Oman in early 2024, against the backdrop of heightened regional tensions over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. 


The United States is Israel's close ally and top provider of military assistance, while Iran backs the Palestinian militant group Hamas. 


Bagheri arrived Monday in Lebanon, on his first foreign trip since assuming the interim role following the death of Hossein Amirabdollahian in a helicopter crash last month that also killed Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi. 


Bagheri said the choice of destination for his visit was "because Lebanon is the cradle of resistance" against Israel. 


Iran supports the powerful Lebanese group Hezbollah financially and militarily. 


The Shiite Muslim movement, a Hamas ally, has traded regular cross-border fire with Israel since the start of the Gaza war in early October. 


Bagheri, Iran's former top nuclear negotiator, said discussions with Western powers about Tehran's atomic activities were ongoing. 


Western governments fear Iran is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon — a claim the Islamic republic denies. 


"We advise them not to miss the opportunity any further and compensate for the actions that they must have carried out but didn't," Bagheri said, as a meeting of the U.N. nuclear watchdog opened in Vienna. 


Diplomats told AFP that Britain, France and Germany will seek to censure Tehran over its lack of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the organization's board meeting. 


At the last board meeting in March, European powers shelved their plans to confront Iran because of a lack of support from Washington. 


Bagheri is due to travel from Lebanon to Syria on Tuesday.

## On Alaska’s remote southeast coastline, radio keeps communities connected

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

washington — In the remote and rural communities of southeastern Alaska, news is never in short supply thanks to a small but dedicated crew of journalists.


“We are what we call community radio,” said Angela Denning. The radio journalist is the regional news director of the media nonprofit CoastAlaska and oversees six newsrooms.


All of them, she said, are “pretty darn remote.”


Just one person runs the newsroom in Wrangell — an island borough of little more than 2,000 people on the Alaska panhandle — while two people run the newsroom that Denning oversees in Petersburg, another panhandle town.


“It has 3,300 people. It's on an island, so no roads in or out. We take planes, we take boats,” she told VOA.




Denning says their audiences rely on stations like hers for news and natural disaster warnings. But radio also provides a human connection that is harder to achieve through websites.


“It’s very personal,” said Denning, adding that listeners often tune in for updates on middle school basketball games, or just to hear the voices of their neighbors, friends or colleagues.


That personal connection serves them well as CoastAlaska teams up with media nonprofits working to prevent the spread of disinformation.


Communities where agriculture, logging or mining are the main industries are seeing a growth in misinformation and disinformation, media groups say. To stem that, organizations like the Rural News Network and the News Literacy Project work with affiliates, including CoastAlaska, to offer audiences the tools to spot and debunk false information.


Local media are often on the front line of fighting disinformation, said Mike Webb, the News Literacy Project’s senior vice president of communications.


As the U.S. prepares for elections, his nonpartisan group is helping newsrooms like Denning’s to equip audiences with the tools they need to spot misinformation.


Ten years ago in Alaska, Denning said, misinformation and distrust in media were less of a worry.


“Trust. It was something we took for granted,” she said. But now, “we don't assume there’s trust anymore. Quite the opposite.”


To build and preserve trust, CoastAlaska works with its community to help audiences feel more involved. They have changed the formats of public forums to allow more engagement and to receive feedback from their audiences.


For instance, when residents felt as if they didn’t have a voice in a local election, the journalists set up a way for audiences to ask questions at a borough assembly candidates forum.


For the first half, the media asked questions. Then they let residents quiz the candidates.


“We pulled their names out of the hat during the program so that those people would be able to ask the questions,” Denning said. And people had to ask their question to all the candidates, not just one.


It was one way for some people who are suspicious of or don't have much trust in media outlets to feel like they were empowered and part of the process.


“I think it kind of worked,” she said. “We got good feedback about it. But of course, we approached it very carefully.”


Part of CoastAlaska’s success is its existing connections with the audience.


“I think it works because we are covering community-based local events such as who's going to tell the community how the high school did at their basketball game over the weekend. That's us,” Denning said.


In her region, the most engagement their reporting receives is often on the successes of students or community member profiles, Denning said. Though, she added, the reporters also cover issues like landslides, conflicts with the logging industry, and economic problems.


"Our listeners and readers may not agree with everything we say but they also really appreciate the coverage that we give to the community, all those little things,” she said.


Despite being largely isolated on islands in the state’s southeast, Denning’s reporters are always talking with each other.


“If you're in constant contact with your colleagues, even if they're a few hundred miles away on a different island, you can still feel supported,” Denning said. “During this time of misinformation and distrust, that's more important than ever.”

## Redox replaces core applications with COSMIC applications

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

Another month, another Redox progress report. The Rust-based operating system, headed by system76 engineer Jeremy Soller, has made a big move by replacing Redox&#8217; Orbital file manager, text editor and terminal by their COSMIC counterparts, COSMIC Files, COSMIC Editor and COSMIC Terminal, in the default Redox installation. COSMIC is the Rust-based desktop environment system76 is currently developing for their Linux distribution, Pop!_OS. You really have to start wondering what the long-term goals for Redox really are here. I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re intending to replace Linux with it &#8211; that&#8217;d be suicide &#8211; but the steady progress towards a general purpose operating system is undeniable.

## Libadwaita: splitting GTK and design language

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

There&#8217;s no denying that not everyone is happy with the state of the GTK world, and I, too, have argued that GNOME&#8217;s massive presence and seeming unwillingness to cooperate with or even consider the existence of other GTK-based desktop environments is doing real, measurable harm to the likes of Xfce, Cinnamon, and others. A major root cause is a feeling that GTK is nothing but a vessel for GNOME, and that the project doesn&#8217;t really seem to care much about anyone else. GNOME Foundation member and all-round very kind person Hari Rana, also known as TheEvilSkeleton, penned a blog post highlighting the other side of the story. In essence, what it comes down to, according to Rana, is that it&#8217;s better for everyone if GNOME-specific widgets are moved out of GTK, and into something else &#8211; first libhandy, and now its succesor libadwaita, splitting the toolkit (GTK) from the design language (libadwaita). This allows GNOME developers to focus on, well, GNOME, and frees up time for GTK developers to focus on generic widgets that aren&#8217;t specific to GNOME. Thanks to the removal of GNOME widgets from GTK 4, GTK developers can continue to work on general-purpose widgets, without being influenced or restricted in any way by the GNOME HIG. Developers of cross-platform GTK 3 apps that rely exclusively on general-purpose widgets can be more confident that GTK 4 won’t remove these widgets, and hopefully enjoy the benefits that GTK 4 offers. ↫ Hari Rana From a GNOME standpoint, this makes perfect sense, and I can obviously see the benefits for them. However, what this entire post seems to ignore is that the main effect of the split between GTK 4 and libadwaita is that various GTK applications, now targeting libadwaita because of GNOME&#8217;s immense popularity, simply no longer integrate very well with other desktops, like Xfce or Cinnamon. GNOME is, of course, under no obligation to remedy this situation, but at the very least they could acknowledge this is a very real problem that their fellow developers working on Xfce, Cinnamon, MATE, and others, have to deal with. It works the other way around too. Developers targeting the Linux desktop, where GNOME is more or less the default, have to choose between making a GTK application that integrates well with GNOME by opting for libadwaita and leaving non-GNOME users with a crappy experience, or opting for &#8216;pure&#8217; GTK 4 and leaving GNOME users with a worse experience. Neither option is good for the Linux desktop as a whole. The very real ripple effects of GNOME&#8217;s choices regarding GTK and libadwaita are seemingly being stubbornly ignored, neglected, and often not even acknowledged at all, and it&#8217;s no surprise this creates an immense amount of friction in the wider desktop Linux community. It just feels smug and careless, and of course that&#8217;s going to rub people the wrong way- regardless of the purity of your intentions.

Kevin Wells has released a new version of his application for looking up information about MAC addresses from the RISC OS desktop. Version 2.00 of MACadd brings with it a number of changes over the last release. The chief driver of the update is that the provider of the remote application programmer interface (API) that was being used is no longer working with the software, so Kevin has changed the code to support a new one, called MACLookup. Other changes include preventing multiple copies of the software running at once,&#8230;

## One Way Forest Carbon Credits Might Come in Handy

date: 2024-06-03, from: Heatmap News

There’s a nearly 4 million-acre backlog in the western U.S. of forests that have burned and not been re-seeded. That’s slightly larger than the size of Connecticut. And unless we pick up the pace, the shortfall could increase two to three times over by 2050 as wildfires get worse under a warming climate.</p><p>These are the findings of a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/ffgc.2024.1402124/full" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> published last week on the yawning gap between reforestation needs and reforestation capacity in the western U.S. Trees are still the country’s most important resource to counteract climate change, <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/GHG-Emissions-Removals.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offsetting more than 12% of annual greenhouse gas emissions</u></a> as of 2021. But in some areas like in the fire-ravaged Rocky Mountain region, forests have <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/fs_media/fs_document/2020-RPA-Assessment.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>become a net source of carbon</u></a> to the atmosphere, releasing more than they draw down. To prevent the reforestation gap from widening, the new study warns, we have to fix the “reforestation pipeline” — our capacity to collect seeds, grow seedlings, and plant them.</p><p>It also highlights solutions. The research was primarily funded by a company that finances tree-planting efforts by selling credits to carbon-emitting businesses based on the amount of carbon the trees suck up, allowing those businesses to offset their own emissions. To rebuild the country’s reforestation capacity, the study recommends — surprise, surprise — expanding the role of forest carbon offsets, among other ideas.</p><p>Some might look at this paper and dismiss it as biased science, but it got me thinking about the long-running debate in the climate community over trees. Should companies be allowed to offset their emissions from burning fossil fuel by planting carbon-sucking forests? It’s easy to say no. Too many forest-related carbon offset projects have come under fire for using faulty accounting methods or for “protecting” forests that were at no risk of being felled. Plus, there’s the larger risk that offsets provide a license to emit.</p><p>But when you contemplate the chasm between the funding and infrastructure required to restore forests and current capacity and incentives — not just in the U.S., but also globally — it’s easy to see why so many people ignore these realities and say we <em><em>must</em></em> finance reforestation through carbon markets. The new study spells out the predicament quite clearly.</p><p>Solomon Dobrowski, the lead author and a professor of landscape ecology at the University of Montana, was quick to tell me that these numbers were a rough estimate. “I'm not so hung up on the absolute number,” he said. “We can increase the precision of that number. But the take-home message here is that the needs are rapidly outstripping our capacity to fill them.”</p><p>Dobrowski studies how forests grow back after a disturbance like a wildfire, and he’s been documenting a concerning trend. Larger, more severe fires are “punching these big holes into landscapes,” he told me. A severe burn might leave a mile-long stretch between nearest living trees, making it impossible for the forest to regenerate through natural seed dispersal.</p><p>At the same time, the government is struggling to pick up the slack. Due to funding shortfalls, the U.S. Forest Service has <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reforestation-strategy.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>managed to address</u></a> “just 6% of post-wildfire replanting needs” per year over the last decade. </p><p>The average area burned in the U.S. <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10244.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more than doubled from 2000 to 2017</u></a> compared to the preceding 17-year period. But the uptick in severe fires is not the only reason we’ve fallen so far behind on reforestation. At the same time fires have increased, both public and private forestry shops have collapsed. Ironically, the decline of an ecologically destructive industry — logging — also gutted the potential for an ecologically regenerative forestry industry to thrive. </p><p>Previously, most of the Forest Service’s reforestation work was <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/rm/pubs_series/rmrs/proc/rmrs_p080/rmrs_p080_02_balloffet.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>funded by the agency’s timber sales</u></a>. But beginning in the 1990s, logging on public lands sharply declined due to <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45688.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a confluence of factors</u></a>, including over-harvesting in previous decades and the listing of the northern spotted owl as protected under the Endangered Species Act. The agency’s non-fire workforce has decreased by 40% over the past two decades. It also shut down more than half its nurseries, leaving <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/forest-management/vegetation-management/nurseries" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>just six remaining</u></a>. Many <a href="https://www.stateforesters.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NASF-Report-National-Survey-of-State-Operated-Tree-Seedling-and-Tree-Improvement-Programs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>state-owned nurseries have also closed</u></a> due to budget cuts and reduced demand for seedlings.</p><p>Today, the reforestation supply chain is mostly sustained by private companies serving what’s left of the wood product and fiber industry. State and local regulations require companies to replant in the areas they harvest. But since the industry is concentrated on the west coast, so is the supply chain — 95% of seedling production in the western U.S. occurs in Washington, Oregon, and California. That means interior states like Montana, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico, which are seeing increasingly large fires, have no mature supply chain to support reforestation.</p><p>The New Mexico Natural Resources Department, for example, <a href="https://www.emnrd.nm.gov/sfd/reforestation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>estimates it needs 150 million to 390 million seedlings</u></a> to replant the acres burned in the past 20 years. But the only big nursery in the state, a research center at New Mexico State University, can supply just 300,000 seedlings per year. The nearest U.S. Forest Service nursery serving the region is in Boise, Idaho, more than 700 miles away. Matthew Hurteau, a forest ecologist at the University of New Mexico who is a co-author on the reforestation study, told me he has been working with the state to develop a new nursery capable of producing 5 million seedlings a year. The project has received some funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state government, but still needs to raise roughly $60 million more, Hurteau said.</p><p>Nurseries aren’t the only bottleneck. Hurteau has also been working to build the state’s seedbank, a time-consuming process that requires going out into the field and collecting seeds one by one. Another piece of the puzzle is workforce development. Dowbrowski pointed out that the majority of tree planting today is not done by government workers but rather by private contractors that hire H2B guest workers. Due to federal limits on immigration, reforestation contractors <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/reforestation-hits-a-snag-in-shortage-of-foreign-workers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>haven’t even been able to hire enough</u></a> to meet current planting demand. </p><p>The new paper is far from the first to highlight these issues, and policymakers are beginning to address the problem. In 2021, the Forest Service got a major infusion of cash from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which lifted the cap on its annual budget for reforestation from $30 million to at least $140 million with the directive to clear its backlog. </p><p>But Dobrowski said this is a far cry from all that’s needed. In the study, he and his co-authors estimated that clearing the existing backlog in the West alone could cost at least $3.6 billion. And that’s a conservative estimate — it doesn’t include the cost of building more greenhouses or expanding the workforce. “The reality is that the feds don’t have the infrastructure and workforce to address this at scale,” he told me. The Forest Service budget also won’t address reforestation needs on private lands, which account for about 30% of forested land in the western U.S. </p><p>After establishing the scale of the problem, the paper raises a followup question: How can we scale the reforestation supply chain? There, it pivots to argue that “new economic drivers” — like carbon markets — “can modernize the reforestation pipeline and align tree planting efforts with broader ecosystem resilience and climate mitigation goals.”</p><p>This is precisely what Mast Reforestation, the company that funded the research, is trying to do. Mast is vertically integrated — it collects seeds, grows seedlings, and plants them. The company has developed software to improve the efficiency of each of these steps and increase the chances of success, i.e. to minimize tree deaths. To fund its tree-planting efforts, Mast sells carbon credits based on the amount of CO2 the trees will remove from the atmosphere over their lifetimes. It only plants on privately owned, previously burned land that wouldn’t have otherwise been replanted (because the owner couldn’t afford it) or regenerated (because the burn was so severe). The idea is to create a more stable source of financing for reforestation not subject to the whims of congressional appropriations.</p><p>Matthew Aghai, an ecologist who works as the chief science officer at Mast and another of the study’s co-authors, told me there’s a misunderstanding among policymakers and the general public that when forests burn, the government is ready to step in, and all that’s needed is more funding for seedling production. Aghai hopes the new paper illuminates the truth, and how risky it is to wait for state backing that may never arrive. He told me that he sought out Dobrowski to work with him because he knew, as a former academic himself, that if he had written the paper on his own, there would have been a stigma attached to it. “I think the best way for me to get those ideas out was actually something that needs to happen in our broader market, which is a lot more collaboration,” he said. </p><p>There are many climate advocates who believe the problems with carbon offsets can be fixed, that the markets can be reformed, and that “high quality” nature-based credits are possible. Indeed, many consider restoring trust in nature-based carbon credits an imperative if we are to fund reforestation at the level that tackling climate change requires. A few weeks ago, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Salesforce <a href="https://www.symbiosiscoalition.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced a new coalition called Symbiosis</u></a> that will purchase up to 20 million tons of carbon removal credits from nature-based projects that “meet the highest quality bar” and “reflect the latest and greatest science.” Then, last Tuesday, the Biden administration followed up with a show of <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/05/28/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-principles-for-high-integrity-voluntary-carbon-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>support for fixing the voluntary carbon market</u></a>, because it can “deliver steady, reliable revenue streams to a range of decarbonization projects, programs, and practices, including nature-based solutions.” </p><p>But there is one fundamental problem with selling carbon credits based on trees, which no amount of reform or commitment to high integrity can solve. Fossil fuel CO2 emissions are essentially permanent — they stay in the atmosphere for upward of a thousand years. The CO2 sequestered by forests is not. Trees die. In a warming world, with worsening pest outbreaks, drought, and wildfires, the chances of a tree making it to a thousand years without releasing at least some of its stored carbon are slimmer than ever.</p><p>Hurteau, despite contributing to the paper, is deeply skeptical of financing reforestation through the sale of carbon credits. “We need to be making monster investments in maintaining forest cover globally, and I understand why people look at carbon finance to do this,” he said. “But you can't fly in an airplane and pay somebody to plant trees and have it zero out. From an energy balance perspective, for the Earth’s system, that's not real.”</p><p>When I raised this with Dobrowski, who endorsed the paper’s conclusions about the potential for carbon markets, he said it’s something he struggles with. He agreed that a ton of fossil fuel emissions is not the same as a ton of carbon sequestered in trees, but comes back to the fact that we need new incentive structures for people to do reforestation and be better stewards of our forests. It’s something I’ve heard echoed many times over in my reporting — the unspoken subtext essentially being, do you have any better ideas to raise the billions of dollars needed to do this? </p><p>Aghai had a slightly different take. To him, the one-to-one math isn’t so important “as long as the trajectory is moving forward, we're accumulating carbon, we're protecting watersheds, we're increasing the biodiversity index.” That may sound a bit hand-wavy — and it still gives a pass to polluters. But then he raised an interesting point, one that I don’t think I’ve heard before. The environmental damage caused by fossil fuels is not just the carbon they spew into the atmosphere. And the value forests provide is not just the carbon they sequester. </p><p>“Carbon’s our currency right now. It’s the thing that everyone is measuring around,” he said. “But what about all the other destruction that comes with the energy sector? There's cascading effects that impact water, soils, methane. Forests tend to stabilize everything by moving us toward homeostasis at a landscape level. For me, these markets will work when we catalyze them at a regional, dare I say global scale.”</p><p>Are these benefits enough to dismiss the incongruity inherent to forest carbon offsets? To say, for example, that trees might not actually offset the full amount of carbon that Google is putting in the atmosphere, but the funding Google is providing to get these trees in the ground makes some greater, unquantifiable progress toward our climate goals?</p><p>Some scientists have proposed alternative solutions. Myles Allen, a professor of geosystem science at the University of Oxford, has <a href="https://www.iema.net/articles/interview-professor-myles-allen-director-of-the-oxford-net-zero-initiative" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>advocated for “like for like” offsetting</u></a>, in which companies only buy nature-based carbon credits to offset their emissions from nature-based sources, such as land cleared to grow food. To offset fossil fuel emissions, the logic goes, they could buy other kinds of credits, like those based on carbon captured from the air and sequestered deep underground for millenia. The European Union is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-02-27/climate-crisis-european-union-steers-carbon-markets-to-a-brighter-future" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>currently considering a rule</u></a> that would require companies adhere to this principle. Others have <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/forest-contributions-carbon-offsets#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suggested</u></a> companies could make “contributions” to climate mitigation through investments in forests, rather than buying offsets.</p><p>Both would be significant departures from the way corporate sustainability managers have used carbon markets in the past. But the current system is in crisis. The volume of carbon credits traded <a href="https://3298623.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/3298623/SOVCM%202024/State_of_the_Voluntary_Carbon_Markets_20240529%201.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>declined precipitously in the last two years</u></a> as buyers were spooked off buying offsets. Forestry-related credits, in particular, contracted from $1.1 billion in sales in 2022 to just $351 million in sales in 2023, a 69% drop. Within that, the vast majority of the credits traded during both years came from forestry projects that reduced emissions, not reforestation projects like Mast’s that remove carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>Even if you agree with Aghai that carbon markets are our best hope at addressing the reforestation gap, gaining the trust of buyers is a prerequisite. That means that scientists, companies, and governance groups like the <a href="https://icvcm.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market</u></a> first have to converge on what these credits actually mean and how they can be used. </p>

## They might not make it

date: 2024-06-03, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>Months ago I ranted about <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search">Arc Search</a>. My thoughts on the subject have not changed. Not long after that post, the fun people at The Browser Company released a teaser video for an upcoming 5 video series called “WE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT”. And guess what? My blog post made a brief cameo in the trailer, right after Casey Newton, something I found amusing. Anyway, the series was supposed to make fun of all the people who criticise what TBC is doing with their Arc browser and highlight all the reasons why they’re not going to make it. I guess that’s because they’re so confident in their product and are probably sure that they will, in fact, make it, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Well, it’s June. The teaser video came out on March 21st, the second episode on March 22nd, and the third on April 4th. I’m still waiting for a new one to come out but I guess they might not make it to the end of their planned 5 videos series. Oh well.</p>
<p>Unrelated but can I just say that I find the name of the company itself quite baffling? It’s called The Browser Company but what they make is a wrapper around the Chromium web browser. So the browser company is making everything but the actual browser. Can you imagine starting a company called “the pizza company” and then outsourcing the pizza part to a 3rd party? So bizarre.</p>
<p>Anyway, TBC people, if you’re reading this, I look forward to your next video about how you “ruined the internet” and also very much look forward to the one about how you “listen to your members” considering you never replied to the two emails I sent to your support.</p>                <hr>

The median existing-home sales price was $407,600 in April, and $433,500 for a new house. Those numbers have jumped due to the pandemic-era frenzy for real estate.

The Biden administration's decision to approve Ukraine's use of U.S. weapons to attack targets inside Russia marks another turn of a tit-for-tat spiral that has continuously raised the risks of a broader war without offering a path to ending this one. Without a bargaining process, this spiral dynamic might continue for years to come.

## Protecting artists on the fediverse

date: 2024-06-03, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content entry-content">
<p><img src="https://werd.io/file/665dd437da6a67804007c6f2/thumb.jpg" alt="OpenAI" width="1024" height="683"></p><p>Over the weekend, I started to notice a bunch of artists moving to <a href="https://cara.app/explore">Cara</a>, a social network for artists founded by <a href="https://www.zhangjingna.com/">Jingna Zhang</a>, herself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Jingna">an accomplished photographer</a>.</p><p>The fediverse is a decentralized cooperative of social networks that can interact with each other: a user on one network can follow, reply, like, and re-share content from a user on another network. The whole thing depends on an open standard called ActivityPub, shared community norms, and a cooperative culture.</p><p>Of course, my first reaction was that Cara should be compatible with the fediverse so that its content could be more easily discoverable by users on social networks like Threads, Flipboard, and Mastodon. Cara is explicitly set up to be a network for <em>human</em> artists, with no AI-generated content, which will be increasingly valuable as the web becomes flooded with machine-made art. The fediverse would allow them to publish on sites like Cara that are set up to support their needs, while finding a broad audience across the entire web.</p><p>From <a href="https://cara.app/about">its About page</a>:</p><blockquote><p>With the widespread use of generative AI, we decided to build a place that filters out generative AI images so that people who want to find authentic creatives and artwork can do so easily.</p><p>[…] We do not agree with generative AI tools in their current unethical form, and we won’t host AI-generated portfolios unless the rampant ethical and data privacy issues around datasets are resolved via regulation.</p></blockquote><p>I’d love to follow artists on Cara from my Mastodon or Threads accounts. But how does Cara’s AI stance square with the fediverse? How might artists on Cara find a broad audience for their work across the web without risking that art being used as training data without permission?</p><p>The first thing a site can do to prevent its content from being used as training data is to <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/web-developer/block-openai-bard-bing-ai-crawler-bots-using-robots-txt-file/">add exclusion rules to its robots.txt file</a>. These theoretically prevent crawlers owned by model vendors like OpenAI from directly accessing art from the site. There is <a href="https://www.robotstxt.org/faq/legal.html">nothing that legally binds crawlers from obeying robots.txt</a>; it’s less enforceable than a handshake agreement. Still, most claim that they voluntarily do.</p><p>But even if robots.txt was an ironclad agreement, content published to the fediverse doesn’t solely live on its originating server. If Cara was connected to the fediverse, images posted there could still be found on its servers, but they would also be syndicated to the home servers of anyone who followed its users. If a user on Threads followed a Cara user, the Cara user’s images would be copied to Threads; if a user on a Mastodon instance followed that user, the images would be copied to that Mastodon instance. The images are copied across the web as soon as they are published; even if Cara protects <em>its</em> servers from being accessed by AI crawlers, these other downstream fediverse servers are not guaranteed to be protected.</p><p>By connecting to the fediverse, one might argue that servers implicitly license their content to be reused across different services. This is markedly different from RSS, <a href="https://advertisinglaw.fkks.com/post/102gstp/implied-copyright-licenses-in-the-digital-world-blogs-rss-feeds-and-aggregator">where this is explicitly not the case</a>: there is legal precedent that says my RSS feed <em>cannot</em> be used to republish my content elsewhere without my permission (although you can, of course, access its content in a private feed reader; that’s the point). But on the fediverse, the ability to reshare across platforms is core functionality.</p><p>The following things are all true:</p><ul><li>Content published to the fediverse may be both re-copied to and served from other peoples’ servers</li>
<li>Those servers may have different policies regarding content use</li>
<li>In the absence of a robots.txt directive, AI crawlers will scrape a website’s data, even if they don’t have the legal right to</li>
<li>Some servers may themselves be owned by AI vendors and may use federated content to train generative models even without the use of a scraper</li>
</ul><p>As a result, there is no way an author can protect it from being used in an AI training set. The owners of a fediverse site wouldn’t have the right to make a <em>deal</em> with an AI vendor to sell the content it hosted because they wouldn’t have the copyright to all of that content in the first place. But because AI crawlers greedily scrape content without asking for permission, unless the site explicitly opts out with robots.txt, it doesn’t matter.</p><p>This leads me to a few conclusions:</p><ul><li>It is a moral obligation for every fediverse site to prevent crawling of federated content by robustly setting robots.txt directives at a minimum</li>

<li>Someone needs to legally prevent AI vendors from using all available data as training fodder</li>
</ul><p>A fediverse (and a web!) where Cara can safely join while adhering to its principles is a more functional, safer network. To build it we’ll need to support explicit licensing on the fediverse, create a stronger standard for user protections across fediverse sites, and seek more robust legal protections against AI crawler activity. While these are ambitious goals, I believe they’re achievable — and necessary to support the artists and content creators who make the web their home.</p></div>

## AMD unveils Ryzen 9000 CPUs for desktop, Zen 5 takes center stage at Computex 2024

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

In regards to performance, AMD is touting an average (geomean) IPC increase in desktop workloads for Zen 5 of 16%. And with the new desktop Ryzen chips&#8217; turbo clockspeeds remaining largely identical to their Ryzen 7000 predecessors, this should translate into similar performance expectations for the new chips. The AMD Ryzen 9000 series will also launch on the AM5 socket, which debuted with AMD&#8217;s Ryzen 7000 series and marks AMD&#8217;s commitment to socket/platform longevity. Along with the Ryzen 9000 series will come a pair of new high-performance chipsets: the X870E (Extreme) and the regular X870 chipsets. The fundamental features that vendors will integrate into their specific motherboards remain tight-lipped. Still, we do know that USB 4.0 ports are standard on the X870E/X870 boards, along with PCIe 5.0 for both PCIe graphics and NVMe storage, with higher AMD EXPO memory profile support expected than previous generations. ↫ Gavin Bonshor at AnandTech I absolutely love that AMD maintains compatibility with its chipset and socket generations as well as it does. I&#8217;m currently running a Ryzen 9 7900X, and I see no reason to upgrade any time soon, but it&#8217;s good to know I&#8217;ll at least have otions once the time comes. Compare this to Intel, which broke compatibility pretty much intentionally almost every generation for years now, and this is a huge win for consumers. Of course, as AMD regains more and more of its foothold across the market, it will eventually also resort to the kind of tactics Intel has been using while it pretty much had the market to itself. It&#8217;s only a matter of time before we&#8217;ll see the first new Ryzen generation that mysteriously requires a new socket or chipset out of the blue.

## Tock: a secure embedded operating system for microcontrollers

date: 2024-06-03, from: OS News

Tock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent, mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded platforms. Tock&#8217;s design centers around protection, both from potentially malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to protect different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and device drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides compile-time memory safety and type safety. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel (e.g. the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and the kernel. ↫ Tock GitHub page We&#8217;ve never featured Tock on OSNews before, as far as I can tell, which seems odd considering it&#8217;s been around for a while. The most recent release stems from January 2023, so a short while ago, but that&#8217;s not too surprising considering the target audience of this embedded operating system. It&#8217;s licensed under either Apache or MIT.

## US veterans get heroes' welcome in France ahead of D-Day anniversary

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

DEAUVILLE/PARIS — Crowds cheered and applauded as U.S. veterans arrived at French airports ahead of ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day, when more than 150,000 Allied soldiers landed in Normandy to drive out Nazi Germany forces.  


Many of those flying in over the weekend into Monday were older than 100, pushed on wheelchairs by relatives and aides.  


"It's unreal. It's unreal. Wow," 107-year-old Reynolds Tomter said at Paris Charles-de-Gaulle airport as students waved U.S. and French flags and held up photos of the veterans.  




"It feels great ... and I'm so thankful that I got the opportunity to be back out here, my son with me," said 101-year-old Bill Wall, as his son, Ray, pushed him through arrivals.


"I lost some great friends. All of these people who are out there on their crosses and unmarked graves are the true heroes. It gives me a chance to pay tribute to them which they so need. It will bring back some memories of some great people," he added.


After shaking hands with students, 95-year-old Dave Yoho said: "My heart is full. My heart is full."  


In Deauville, Normandy, a specially chartered flight landed on Monday.  


Across Normandy, where beaches and fields still bear the scars of the fighting that erupted on June 6, 1944 and the weeks that followed, preparations were in full gear for official ceremonies. World leaders from U.S. President Joe Biden to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will attend.  


Already, at the weekend, in Vierville-sur-Mer, a town just above Omaha Beach - one of the sectors where U.S. soldiers landed - a re-enactment camp was set up, giving visitors a chance to see what equipment the soldiers were using.  


People took rides in World War Two jeeps and armored vehicles.  


"It's always very intense when we meet veterans, because they always have many stories to tell, and you still feel the emotion," said Julie Boisard, who lives in Normandy and took part in the re-enactment.  


A handful of serving members of the Virginia National Guard 29th Infantry Division gazed out over the beach their elders stormed 80 years earlier.  


"It's historic, it's memorable ... and it's very emotional as well," said U.S. serviceman Esaw Lee. "Those guys were so courageous and so mythical. They were legendary."  


With war raging on Europe's borders in 2024, this anniversary's D-Day ceremony will carry special resonance.  


Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be among the guests. Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, touching off Europe's biggest armed conflict since World War Two, was not invited to the D-Day events.  


The commemorations "remind us that we were occupied for four years and were liberated by the Americans," said Marie-Therese Legallois, who was seven at the time of D-Day, and remembers it vividly.  


"But I always have a bit of sadness to see that the war continues, in Ukraine or elsewhere."

## The Great Electric Car Race of 1968

date: 2024-06-03, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjM2NDI5Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3OTE2MTUyNn0.Tv_jlxz41XLPo_MJrAtp-IUfIpvhxfXfq8rYBUbjI8w/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Volkswagen <a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1797" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>calls</u></a> its new EV minivan “the electric reincarnation of the iconic Microbus.” But while the ID.Buzz may be a touchscreens-and-LEDs update on the bare-bones icon of the Sixties, it is far from the first electrified take on the VW bus. </p>
<p>On an August morning in 1968, a Volkswagen bus jammed full of Caltech students who had hacked it to run on battery power departed their home base in Pasadena, California. Their destination: Cambridge, Massachusetts, home of rival MIT. At the same moment, MIT students in an electrified Chevy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvair" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Corvair</u></a> left the East Coast bound for the West.</p>
<p>“I came up with the crazy idea of a cross-country electric car race between Caltech and MIT,” said Wally Rippel, the student who owned that electrified VW bus and challenged MIT to the 1968 race, while reminiscing about the competition in a <a href="https://events.caltech.edu/calendar/caltech-and-the-origins-of-electric-vehicles-1?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=events-other&utm_source=publicprogramming&utm_content=&utm_term=&mc_cid=394156527b&mc_eid=8eaa8cd7c4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>lecture</u></a> at Caltech last Thursday night. [<em><em>Editor’s note: Caltech is where the author does his day job</em></em>.] “There would be some interest there, and it would stimulate interest in research at Caltech and MIT.”</p>
<p>The great electric car race of 1968 carried the energy of a world’s fair, offering gawkers along its transcontinental route the chance to see the vehicles of the future. It would be another half-century before the EV finally went mainstream, of course. But the Caltech-MIT competition presaged what electric car builders and drivers would need to overcome, and their race is a reminder that the electric car wasn’t just an idea forsaken soon after the dawn of the automotive industry and then suddenly resurrected by Tesla. All along, engineers and scientists imagined another way.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="drop-caps">Climate change is the reason for the whole electric vehicle revolution this century, but it wasn’t the animating force for the EV tinkerers of the ‘60s. Wally Rippel, who owned the Caltech VW bus, and his compatriots were focused on solving <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/fifty-years-clearing-skies-39248" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>smog</u></a> and air pollution, the car-related environmental calamities of that era. In his Caltech talk, Rippel compared the air quality of that smoggy era to the fire-and-brimstone atmosphere of hell itself. “I don’t think any of you could understand it if you didn’t live in Pasadena in the ‘60s,” he said.</p>
<p>Since 80% of L.A.’s smog came from automotive exhaust, Rippel came to the <a href="https://www.eas.caltech.edu/documents/6044/Electric-Vehicles-VWBus.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>conclusion</u></a> that the internal combustion engine should be replaced. The question was, replaced with what? Fuel cells were used during the space race of the 1960s, but they were maddeningly expensive and could provide only 1/20th of the energy he needed to move a car. After seeing electric-powered golf carts around campus, he thought of the electric car.</p>
<p>Just like the climate activists to come, they faced their doubters when the EV race got under way. Team member Dick Rubenstein reminisced in an <a href="https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/276/1/bust.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a> about the race: “I remember the service station attendant at Amboy. He thought it was all a joke and asked: 'What do you need an electric car for, anyway? What air pollution?'”</p>
<p>The challenges of long-distance EV driving were all present in 1968. Rippel wondered, like many people do today, how much more electricity the nation would need to power a country full of EVs. After whipping out his slide rule and performing a few calculations, he determined the U.S. would need 20 to 25 percent more electricity, a reasonable goal.</p>
<p>Rippel and company needed charging stations, of course. The Electric Fuel Propulsion Corporation of Michigan worked with utilities to set up 55 charging stations on the route across the country. Now, those stops didn’t look quite like the Tesla Superchargers of today, located in outlet mall parking lots. Rippel explained that some of their stops amounted to nothing more than a connection to a power line tower or a wire coming up from a manhole.</p>
<p>It typically took 45 to 60 minutes to recharge using the onboard 30kW charger that Rippel put in the bus. That’s not <em><em>that</em></em> far off from today’s times, even though the students ran lead-acid and nickel-cadmium batteries rather than the lithium-ion that is today’s state of the art. (Caltech’s VW carried a literal <em><em>ton</em></em> of batteries to store 16 kWh of energy.) Still: After blowing fuses and causing a power outage in Seligman, Arizona, the Caltech team had to start charging at a lower speed in order to avoid overloading the technology of the time.</p>
<p>Range anxiety was naturally worse, given the experimental technology and the need to make it to the next station on the list. Both teams had chase cars accompanying their EV and occasionally resorted to towing the electric car when mechanical gremlins struck. Caltech towed a generator along just in case.</p>
<p>The biggest enemy? Heat. Today’s EV batteries suffer under extreme temperatures, with heat degrading battery life and cold diminishing range. But modern EVs have sophisticated cooling mechanisms to help protect the cells. The student EVs did not have this. They resorted to a simpler fix: dumping ice on the batteries during charging stops.</p>
<p>Wrote Rubenstein: “We finally solved our battery overheating problem in McLean, Texas. While the car was charging, I went into town to buy some rubber tubing and a rubber syringe bulb. We got some small ice cubes and put them on the batteries, then used the tubing to siphon the water out of the battery enclosure. We used the syringe bulb to start the siphon. That was our handy-dandy cooling system, for which I blushingly accept credit.”</p>
<p>In other ways, their simple EV technology is startlingly familiar. The VW bus nearly didn’t make it to the charging stop in the desert of Needles, California, but used the downhill grade into town to put some charge back on the battery, just as regenerative braking in today’s EVs saves energy when the car is decelerating or rolling downhill. (Today, Needles is home to several EV fast-charging stations, befitting its nature as one of the rare pit stops on this lonely stretch of desert highway.) </p>
<p>The article in Caltech’s <em><em>Engineering & Science</em></em> magazine concludes by saying future lead-cobalt rechargeable batteries might reach 250 miles of range — just about what lithium-ion batteries were <em><em>actually</em></em> doing a half-century later, when cars like the Tesla Model 3 arrived.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p class="drop-caps">The race ended nine days later, on September 4. MIT reached the end of the line first, by about a day and a half. But, per the agreed-upon rules, its team was dinged with many hours’ worth of time penalties because of how often the electric Chevy Corvair had to be towed — including across the finish line. The EV van from Pasadena, for all its own troubles, reached MIT under its own power and was, eventually, declared the winner.</p>
<p>In retrospect, the race looks like a one-off — a moment when young scientists with a dream tried to show the world a better way but decades before the world was ready to see it. In fact, though, this calamitous, makeshift Cannonball Run left threads that led to the electrification of vehicles that’s finally happening around the world.</p>
<p>The next generation of idealistic auto engineers created the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunraycer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sunraycer</u></a>, a 1980s solar-powered race car that crossed the Australian Outback. Its success led to the <a href="https://www.gm.com/heritage/collection/gm-concept/1990-impact-experimental" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GM Impact</u></a>, a 1990 concept EV meant to show the world what was possible. And the Impact led to the fabled, doomed GM EV1.</p><p>EV1 is remembered as the electric car that wasn’t, the victim in the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Who Killed the Electric Car</em></em></u></a>? But attempts like it and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Propulsion_tzero" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AC Propulsion tZero</u></a> in the 1990s showed that EVs were not only possible, but could be downright cool if you did them right. The rest is history.</p>

## CEOs got hefty pay raises in 2023, widening the gap with the workers they oversee

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

New York — The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 13% last year, easily surpassing the gains for workers at a time when inflation was putting considerable pressure on Americans' budgets.


The median pay package for CEOs rose to $16.3 million, up 12.6%, according to data analyzed for The Associated Press by Equilar. Meanwhile, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers rose 4.1% through 2023. At half the companies in this year’s pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company’s pay scale almost 200 years to make what their CEO did.


CEOs got rewarded as the economy showed remarkable resilience, underpinning strong profits and boosting stock prices. After navigating the pandemic, companies faced challenges from persistent inflation and higher interest rates. About two dozen CEOs in the AP's annual survey received a pay bump of 50% or more.


“In this post-pandemic market, the desire is for boards to reward and retain CEOs when they feel like they have a good leader in place,” said Kelly Malafis, founding partner of Compensation Advisory Partners in New York. “That all combined kind of leads to increased compensation.”


But Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, believes the gap in earnings between top executives and workers plays into the overall dissatisfaction among Americans about the economy.


“Most of the focus here is on inflation, which people are really feeling, but they’re feeling the pain of inflation more because they’re not seeing their wages go up enough," she said.


Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can’t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits. The median stock award rose almost 11% last year compared to a 2.7% increase in bonuses.


The AP’s CEO compensation study included pay data for 341 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.


Top earners


Hock Tan, the CEO of Broadcom Inc., topped the AP survey with a pay package valued at about $162 million.


Broadcom granted Tan stock awards valued at $160.5 million on Oct. 31, 2022, for the company's 2023 fiscal year. Tan was given the opportunity to earn up to 1 million shares starting in fiscal 2025, according to a securities filing, provided that Broadcom’s stock meets certain targets – and he remains CEO for five years.




At the time of the award, Broadcom’s stock was trading at $470. Tan would receive portions of the stock awards if the stock hit $825 and $950 and the the full award if the average closing price is at or above $1,125 for 20 consecutive days between October 2025 and October 2027. The targets seemed ambitious when set, but the stock has skyrocketed since, and reached an all-time closing high of $1,436.17 on May 28.


Like rival Nvidia Inc., Broadcom is riding the current artificial intelligence frenzy among tech companies. Its chips are used by businesses and public entities ranging from major banks, retailers, telecom operators and government bodies.


In granting the stock award, Broadcom noted that under Tan its market value has increased from $3.8 billion in 2009 to $645 billion (as of May 23) and that its total shareholder return during that time easily surpassed that of the S&P 500. It also said Tan will not receive additional stock awards during the remainder of the five-year period.




Other CEOs at the top of AP's survey are William Lansing of Fair Isaac Corp, ($66.3 million); Tim Cook of Apple Inc. ($63.2 million); Hamid Moghadam of Prologis Inc. ($50.9 million); and Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix ($49.8 million).


At Apple, Cook’s compensation represented a 36% decline from the year prior. Cook requested a pay cut for 2023, in response to the vote at Apple’s 2022 annual meeting, where just 64% of shareholders approved of his pay package.




The survey's methodology excluded CEOs such as Nikesh Arora at Palo Alto Networks ($151.4 million) and Christopher Winfrey at Charter Communications ($89 million).


Although securities filings show Elon Musk received no compensation as CEO of Tesla Inc., his pay is currently front and center at the electric car company. Musk is asking shareholders to restore a pay package that was struck down by a judge in Delaware, who said the approval process for the package was “deeply flawed.” The compensation, mostly stock awards valued at $2.3 billion when granted in 2018, is now estimated to be worth around $45 billion.


CEO pay vs workers


Workers across the country have been winning higher pay since the pandemic, with wages and benefits for private-sector employees rising 4.1% in 2023 after a 5.1% increase in 2022, according to the Labor Department.


Even with those gains, the gap between the person in the corner office and everyone else keeps getting wider. Half the CEOs in this year’s pay survey made at least 196 times what their median employee earned. That’s up from 185 times in last year’s survey.


The gap is particularly wide at companies where employees typically earn lower wages, such as retailers. At Ross Stores, for example, the company says its employee at the very middle of the pay scale was a part-time retail store associate who made $8,618. It would take 2,100 years earning that much to equal CEO Barbara Rentler’s compensation from 2023, valued at $18.1 million. A year earlier, it would have taken the median worker 1,137 years to match the CEO’s pay.


Corporate boards often feel pressure to keep upping the pay for well-performing CEOs out of fear that they’ll walk out the door and make more at a rival. They focus on paying compensation that is competitive within their industry or marketplace and not on the pay ratio, Malafis said. The better an executive performs, the more the board is willing to pay.


The disparity between what the chief executive makes and the workers earn wasn't always so wide.


After World War II and up until the 1980s, CEOs of large publicly traded companies made about 40 to 50 times the average worker’s pay, said Brandon Rees, deputy director of corporations and capital markets for the AFL-CIO, which runs an Executive Paywatch website that tracks CEO pay.


“The [current] pay ratio signals a sort of a winner take all culture, that companies are treating their CEOs as, you know, as superstars as opposed to, team players,” Rees said.


Say on pay


Despite the criticism, shareholders tend to give overwhelming support to pay packages for company leaders. From 2019 to 2023, companies typically received just under 90% of the vote for their executive compensation plans, according to data from Equilar.


Shareholders do, however, occasionally reject a compensation plan, although the votes are non-binding. In 2023, shareholders at 13 companies in the S&P 500 gave the executive pay packages less than 50% support.


After its investors gave another resounding thumbs down to the pay packages for its top executives, Netflix met with many of its biggest shareholders last year to discuss their concerns. It also talked with major proxy-advisory firms, which are influential because they recommend how investors should vote at companies’ annual meetings.


Following the talks, Netflix announced several changes to redesign its pay policies. For one, it eliminated executives’ option to allocate their compensation between cash and options. It will no longer give out stock options, which can give executives a payday as long as the stock price stays above a certain level. Instead, the company will give restricted stock that executives can profit from only after a certain amount of time or after certain performance measures are met.


The changes will take effect in 2024. For last year, co-CEO Ted Sarandos received options valued at $28.3 million and a cash bonus of $16.5 million. Co-CEO Greg Peters received options valued at $22.7 million and a cash bonus of $13.9 million.


Anderson, of the Institute for Policy Studies, said Say on Pay votes are important because they “shine a spotlight on some of the most egregious cases of executive access, and it can lead to negotiations over pay and other issues that shareholders might want to raise with corporate leadership.”


“But I think the impact, certainly on the overall size of CEO packages has not had much effect in some cases,” she said.


Female CEOs


More women made the AP survey than in previous years, but their numbers in the corner office are still minuscule compared to their male counterparts. Of the 342 CEOs included in Equilar’s data, 25 were women.


Lisa Su, CEO and chair of the board of chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, was the highest paid female CEO in the AP survey for the fifth year in a row in fiscal 2023, bringing in compensation valued at $30.3 million — flat with her compensation package in 2022. Her overall rank rose to 21 from 25.


The other top paid female CEOs include Mary Barra of automaker General Motors ($27.8 million); Jane Fraser of banking giant Citigroup ($25.5 million); Kathy Warden of aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman Corp. ($23.5 million); and Carol Tome of package deliverer UPS Inc. ($23.4 million).


The median pay package for female CEOs rose 21% to $17.6 million. That’s better than the men fared: Their median pay package rose 12.2% to $16.3 million.

## As Hunter Biden's gun case starts jury selection, president says he has 'boundless love' for him

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

WILMINGTON, Del. — President Joe Biden's son Hunter arrived at court on Monday for jury selection in a federal gun case against him after the collapse of a deal with prosecutors that would have avoided the spectacle of a trial so close to the 2024 election. First lady Jill Biden arrived shortly after, entering the courthouse in support of her son.


Joe Biden said that as president he wouldn't comment on the criminal trial but as a dad he has "boundless love for my son, confidence in him, and respect for his strength."


"I am the President, but I am also a Dad," he said in a statement. "Jill and I love our son, and we are so proud of the man he is today."


Hunter Biden, who spent the weekend with his parents, has been charged in Delaware with three felonies stemming from a 2018 firearm purchase when he was, according to his memoir, in the throes of a crack addiction. He has been accused of lying to a federally licensed gun dealer, making a false claim on the application used to screen firearms applicants when he said he was not a drug user, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.


He has pleaded not guilty and has argued he's being unfairly targeted by the Justice Department, after Republicans decried the now-defunct deal as special treatment for the Democratic president's son.


The trial comes just days after Donald Trump, Republicans' presumptive 2024 presidential nominee, was convicted of 34 felonies in New York City. A jury found the former president guilty of a scheme to cover up a hush money payment to a porn actor to fend off damage to his 2016 presidential campaign. The two criminal cases are unrelated, but their proximity underscores how the criminal courtroom has taken center stage during the 2024 campaign.


Hunter Biden is also facing a separate trial in California in September on charges of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. Both cases were to have been resolved through a deal with prosecutors last July, the culmination of a yearslong investigation into his business dealings.


But Judge Maryellen Noreika, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, questioned some unusual aspects of the deal, which included a proposed guilty plea to misdemeanor offenses to resolve the tax crimes and a diversion agreement on the gun charge, which meant as long as he stayed out of trouble for two years the case would be dismissed. The lawyers squabbled over the agreement, could not come to a resolution, and the deal fell apart. Attorney General Merrick Garland then appointed the top investigator as a special counsel in August, and a month later Hunter Biden was indicted.


This trial isn't about Hunter Biden's foreign business affairs — which Republicans have seized on without evidence to try to paint the Biden family as corrupt. But it will excavate some of Hunter Biden's darkest moments and put them on display.


The president's allies are worried about the toll the trial may take on the elder Biden, who's long been concerned about the well-being and sobriety of his only living son and who must now watch as those painful past mistakes are publicly scrutinized. He's also protective: Hunter Biden was with his father all weekend before the case began, biking with his dad and attending church together.


President Biden, in a last-minute switch in plans, shifted from his Rehoboth Beach home back to his Wilmington compound on Sunday evening. Boarding a helicopter on Sunday was the only time the president was seen publicly without his son all weekend.


Hunter Biden arrived first at the Delaware courthouse on Monday. The first lady, who turned 73 on Monday, followed about 15 minutes later and walked briskly into court, flanked by U.S. Secret Service agents. Hunter Biden's sister Ashley Biden was also in court to support him.


Allies are also worried the trial could become a distraction as the president tries to campaign under anemic poll numbers and as he is preparing for an upcoming presidential debate while the proceedings play out.


Prosecutors are hoping to show Hunter Biden was in the throes of addiction when he bought the gun and therefore lied on the forms. They have said they're planning to use as evidence his published memoir, and they may also introduce contents from a laptop that he left at a Delaware repair shop and never retrieved. The contents made their way to Republicans in 2020 and were publicly leaked, revealing embarrassing and personal photos in which he's often nude and doing drugs and messages in which he asks dealers about scores.


The judge will ask a group of prospective jurors a series of questions to determine whether they can serve impartially on the jury, including whether they have donated to political campaigns or run for political office. She will ask whether their views about the 2024 presidential campaign prevent them from being impartial.


She's also going to ask whether prospective jurors believe Hunter Biden is being prosecuted because his father is the president. Also, she'll ask about firearms purchasing and addiction issues, including: "Do you believe someone who is addicted to drugs should not be charged with a crime?"


The case against Hunter Biden stems from a period when, by his own public admission, he was addicted to crack. His descent into drugs and alcohol followed the 2015 death of his brother, Beau Biden, from cancer. He bought and owned a gun for 11 days in October 2018 and indicated on the gun purchase form that he was not using drugs.


Hunter Biden has pleaded not guilty in both cases, and his attorneys have suggested they may argue he didn't see himself as an addict when prosecutors say he checked "no" to the question on the form. They'll also attack the credibility of the gun store owner.


Prosecutors, meanwhile, are also planning to call as witnesses Hunter Biden's ex-wife and his brother's widow, Hallie, with whom he became romantically involved.


If he were to be convicted, he could face up to 25 years in prison, though first-time offenders do not get anywhere near the maximum and it's unclear whether the judge would give him time behind bars.

## California firefighters continue battling wind-driven wildfire east of San Francisco

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

SACRAMENTO, California — California firefighters made significant progress Sunday to tame a wind-driven wildfire that scorched thousands of acres 97 kilometers east of San Francisco, burned down a home and forced residents to flee the area near the central California city of Tracy.


The fire erupted Saturday afternoon in the grassy hills managed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the country's key centers for nuclear weapons science and technology. The cause was under investigation.


The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the research center was not under immediate threat from the blaze, dubbed the Corral Fire, which had devoured some 52 square kilometers by Sunday afternoon. The fire was 50% contained as of Sunday evening.


Thousands of people in the area, including parts of the city of Tracy with a population of 100,000, were ordered to leave for evacuation centers Saturday. The evacuation order was lifted to allow residents to return home starting Sunday evening. Tracy is about 112 kilometers south of California's capital in Sacramento.


CalFire Battalion Chief Josh Silveira said Sunday afternoon the fire “burned right up to the homes” in the area and destroyed one house. With calmer winds and milder weather Sunday, Silveira said he didn't expect the fire to grow.


Two firefighters suffered minor to moderate burns on Saturday and were expected to make a full recovery, Silveira said.


The wildfire presented no threat to any laboratory facilities or operations and had moved away from the site, Lawrence Livermore spokesperson Paul Rhien said in a statement to The Associated Press early Sunday.


“As a precaution, we have activated our emergency operations center to monitor the situation through the weekend,” Rhien said.


Photos showed a wall of flames moving over the parched landscape as dark smoke billowed into the sky.


The wildfire also forced the closure of two major highways, including an interstate that connects the San Francisco Bay Area to San Joaquin County in central California. But they had reopened by Sunday afternoon.


The San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services on Saturday issued an evacuation order for areas west of the California Aqueduct, south of Corral Hollow Creek, west to Alameda County and south to Stanislaus County. A temporary evacuation point was established at Larch Clover Community Center in Tracy. The county also asked residents to temporarily use boiled tap water or bottled water for drinking and cooking purposes.


Sunday’s high temperature for Tracy was expected to reach 29 degrees Celsius, with no rain in the forecast. But hotter conditions are on their way.


The National Weather Service said “dangerously hot conditions” with highs of 39.4 C to 42.2 C were expected later in the week for the San Joaquin Valley, an area that encompasses Tracy. Wind gusts of up to 72 kph lashed the region Saturday night, according to meteorologist Idamis Shoemaker of the weather service in Sacramento.

<p>We spent this month moving northward through both southern and northern British Columbia. We've been moving almost every day, stopping every night to anchor, sleep and recuperate. Sailing near land is not as relaxing as sailing offshore, this reef-strewn coast requires careful navigation. We've had many long days of endless tacking from one side of the channel to the other, almost all the way to Port McNeill, then after that we started to get more weather from the south for some mostly pleasant, but cold and rainy, downwind sailing. We've been using our woodstove a lot, in evenings it helps warm the boat after a long sail.</p>

<p>On May 29th, 623 nautical miles miles after leaving Victoria, we arrived in Prince Rupert, our last major port in British Columbia before we head north to Southeast Alaska. Then, on June 2nd, we arrived in Ketchikan, Southeast Alaska. Most of our updates this month detail some of the places we've been(see the above list).

<p>We've seen sea otters, lots of humpback whales, two pods of orcas(one pod had a baby tagging along), eagles, and lots of mountains.

## Sally Buzbee steps down as executive editor of The Washington Post

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

New York — The Washington Post said Sunday that its executive editor, Sally Buzbee, has stepped down after three years at the top of one of journalism's most storied brands.


She will be replaced by Matt Murray, former editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, through this fall's presidential election. Following that, Robert Winnett, deputy editor of the Telegraph Media Group, will take over as editor as the newsroom restructures its operations.


No reason was given for Buzbee's departure. She wasn't quoted in the news release announcing that she was leaving and did not immediately return a message seeking comment.


The Post also announced that it was launching a new division in its newsroom dedicated to reaching audiences who want to pay for and consume news in a different way.


Buzbee, former top editor at The Associated Press, was selected as the Post's top editor in May 2021. She replaced a renowned predecessor, Martin Baron, after the Post exploded in popularity during the Trump administration.


Buzbee was the first woman to serve as executive editor of The Washington Post. And like Jill Abramson, the first woman to be top editor at The New York Times, her tenure was short: Abramson had her job from 2011 to 2014.


It has been a miserable few years financially for the news industry, including for the Post. It has bled subscribers to the point where new publisher, Will Lewis, told employees last month that the newspaper lost $77 million last year.


“To speak candidly, we are in a hole, and have been for some time,” Lewis said, according to the Post.


Lewis was named late last year to replace Fred Ryan as Post publisher. He has worked at both The Wall Street Journal and The Telegraph in England, the places he turned to to find the new executives.


He's talked about creating a multi-tier subscription plan for The Post, similar to that in place at Politico. In an email to employees late Sunday, Lewis said the new department will focus on more video storytelling, embrace artificial intelligence and flexible payment methods. It will begin this fall, he said.


In an earlier meeting, “we highlighted the need to move away from the traditional one-size-fits-all approach in the news media industry and focus on creating news for a broader range of readers and customers.”


It augurs a change to the traditional structure of the Post. In his memo, Lewis mentioned “three newsrooms.” Winnett will not take on the title of executive editor, but he will be responsible for the “core coverage areas” of politics, investigations, business, technology, sports and features. He has run The Telegraph's news operations since 2013, the Post said.


Murray will take over as leader of the newly created department starting Nov. 6, the Post said. No one will have the title of executive editor: Murray, Winnett and David Shipley, the editorial page editor who will lead the “opinions newsroom,” will each report directly to Lewis, the Post said.


“By creating three strong journalism functions — core, service/social and opinions — we are taking a definitive step away from the ‘one size fits all’ approach and moving towards meeting our audiences where they are,” Lewis said.


The Post won three Pulitzer Prizes last month, including one in national reporting for a vivid series on the impact of the AR-15 rifle.

## Puerto Rico Rep. Jesús Manuel Ortiz wins gubernatorial primary

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico Rep. Jesús Manuel Ortiz defeated Sen. Juan Zaragoza in a gubernatorial primary held Sunday by their Popular Democratic Party, which seeks a return to power in the upcoming general elections.


Zaragoza conceded defeat after obtaining 38% of the votes to his rival's 62%, even though only a little more than 60% of the votes had been counted.


Meanwhile, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi was still locked in a battle against Puerto Rico congresswoman Jenniffer González in a primary held by the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. The two ran on the same ticket four years ago, but González announced her plan to challenge Pierluisi in early December.


All candidates face disgruntled voters on an island still struggling with chronic power outages and awaiting completion of reconstruction projects following Hurricane Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm in September 2017.


Other ongoing complaints include the difficulty of obtaining business permits, a fractured education system and the lack of access to capital markets after the local government emerged two years ago from the biggest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history after announcing in 2015 that it was unable to pay its more than $70 billion public debt load.


The debt was accumulated by governments that overspent, overestimated revenue and borrowed millions despite a ballooning debt.


Running alongside Pierluisi for the position of congressional representative was Puerto Rico Sen. William Villafañe, while senior U.S. naval military officer Elmer Román, a former secretary of state for Puerto Rico, sought the position under González.


Meanwhile, Puerto Rico Sen. Juan Zaragoza, who was highly lauded for his work as the island's former treasury secretary, ran against Rep. Jesús Manuel Ortiz to be the main candidate for the Popular Democratic Party, which supports the island's status quo as a U.S. territory.


Attorney Pablo José Hernández was running unopposed to be the party's candidate for resident commissioner, the first person in 20 years to seek that nomination.


Voting centers closed Sunday evening, with political pundits warning that voter turnout appeared low and that electronic voting machines did not properly work in some towns, although it was too early to determine the magnitude of the problem.


All candidates faced disgruntled voters on an island still struggling with chronic power outages and high electric bills as it awaits completion of reconstruction projects following Hurricane Maria, which hit as a Category 4 storm in September 2017.


Power outages were reported at more than a dozen voting centers, including one where Ortiz arrived to cast his vote, forcing officials to revert to a manual process. Heavy rains also pelted parts of the island, with flood warnings issued for nearly a dozen towns and cities.


Power outages remain such a big concern that the State Commission of Elections rented more than a dozen generators and a private power company identified 81 alternate voting sites with guaranteed electricity.


"It's been years since I last voted," said Benito López, a 66-year-old retiree wearing a T-shirt that read, "The Island of Enchantment." He planned to cast a vote for a candidate he would not reveal "to see if there's any improvement and change."


Other voter complaints include the difficulty of obtaining business permits, a fractured education system, and the island's lack of access to capital markets after the local government emerged two years ago from the largest debt restructuring in U.S. history.


Meanwhile, more than $9 billion of debt owed by Puerto Rico's power company, the largest of any government agency, remains unresolved. A federal judge overseeing a bankruptcy-like process has yet to rule on a restructuring plan following bitter negotiations between the government and bondholders.


"They have broken Puerto Rico," said 79-year-old Cecilio Rodríguez of the current and previous administrations as he waited to cast his vote. "Economic development must be a priority."


For other voters, stopping the exodus of doctors from Puerto Rico and improving the U.S. territory's crumbling health system is a priority.


"The patients are the ones who have to stay here and endure this. It's not fair," said Dr. Alfredo Rivera Freytes, an anesthesiologist who left Puerto Rico for the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Thomas because of the ongoing problems with the local health system.


He returned two years ago with plans to retire but found himself working again because of the need for anesthesiologists in Puerto Rico.


Ahead of the primaries, Pierluisi has touted record tourist numbers, ongoing hurricane reconstruction and growing economic development among his successes as he seeks re-election. He has pledged to prioritize projects targeting children and the island's growing elderly population, among other things.


An event marking the end of his campaign held a week before the primaries was headlined by former Gov. Ricardo Rosselló, who resigned in August 2019 following nearly two weeks of massive protests touched off by a leak of crude and insulting chat messages between him and his top advisers.


His opponent, González, did not hold a campaign closer. She has pledged to crack down on corruption, award more funds to agencies to help victims of violence amid a surge in killings of women, and stem an exodus of doctors and other medical workers to the U.S. mainland.


Meanwhile, Zaragoza has promised to prioritize climate change and renewable energy, decentralize the island's education department and improve access to health. His opponent, Ortiz, has pledged to improve the licensing process to retain doctors, simplify the island's tax system and revamp health care.


Puerto Rico's next governor will have to work alongside a federal control board that oversees the island's finances and was created after the government declared bankruptcy.


Ahead of Sunday's primaries, more than 4,900 inmates voted in prisons across the U.S. territory. The State Commission of Elections also has received and counted more than 122,000 early ballots.

## Known fizzled

date: 2024-06-03, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog


<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>One of my biggest regrets is how the Known hosted service declined. The paid subscriptions came to an end, and eventually the hosting whimpered out. Behind the scenes, the database cluster was in need of more maintenance than I was able to provide.</p><p>Known itself has required more maintenance than I’ve been able to provide for quite some time. I wish I could spend more bandwidth on it, but the state of my life right now is that it’s just not possible for me to dedicate the coding time for something that isn’t paying my bills and isn’t having the impact I wanted it to.</p><p>I wish we’d sent out a strong email at the end and allowed everyone to export their data automatically. I also wish Known had import/export that was reliable so that people could explore other platforms.</p><p>After attempting to claw the time to do it myself, I’d like to hire someone to build the latter, and then apply it to everyone who had a hosted account. The export function could be built into the Known UI or as a CLI tool. If this seems like something you might be able to do, let me know.</p><p>Overall, I have a ton of regrets about Known — something for a future post (or series of posts), maybe. This site is still powered by it, though, and I know other people still use it, too. So it’s not dead — just small.</p></div>

## Border mayors heading to DC for Tuesday's immigration announcement

date: 2024-06-03, from: VOA News USA

McALLEN, TEXAS — At least two Texas border mayors are headed to Washington on Tuesday when President Joe Biden is expected to announce an executive order that will mark his latest and most aggressive plan to curtail the number of migrants allowed to seek asylum in the U.S.


Brownsville Mayor John Cowen and Edinburg Mayor Ramiro Garza both confirmed they were invited by the White House for an immigration announcement on Tuesday. Cowen told the Associated Press that he plans to attend, while Garza said he would have more details on Monday about his plans.


Notably, the Democratic mayor of Eagle Pass, the Texas-Mexico border town where the number of migrants led to a state-federal clash over border security, had not received an invitation as of Sunday. The mayor from McAllen said he was invited but could not attend because of a prior commitment.


A White House spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment on other mayors who were invited to the announcement.


The AP reported last week that the White House was finalizing an executive order that could shut off asylum requests and automatically deny entrance to migrants once the number of people encountered by U.S. border officials exceeded a new daily threshold.


The unilateral action is expected even as the number of border crossings at the southern U.S. border has declined since December, due in large part to Mexico's escalated enforcement efforts. But Biden wants to head off any potential spike in crossings that could occur later in the year, as the fall election draws closer, when the weather cools and numbers tend to rise.


Immigration remains a concern for voters ahead of the November elections, with Republicans eager to punish Biden electorally over the issue. Democrats have responded that Republicans, at the behest of Donald Trump, killed a bipartisan border deal in Congress that would have led to the toughest legislative restrictions on asylum in years.
