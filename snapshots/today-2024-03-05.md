date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA

The White House says it looks forward to working with the new Indonesian administration but stopped short of congratulating Prabowo Subianto on his apparent victory in Indonesia’s presidential election last month. Prabowo, for his part, has vowed to continue a policy that allows Jakarta to reap Chinese investments while maintaining security ties with Washington. White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara has this report.

## US Stops Short of Congratulating Indonesia's Prabowo on Apparent Election Victory

date: 2024-03-06, from: VOA News USA

white house — The White House said it looks forward to working with the incoming Indonesian administration but stopped short of congratulating Prabowo Subianto on his apparent victory in Indonesia’s presidential election last month.


“We congratulate the Indonesian people on a successful election. The president looks forward to early engagement with the new administration and strengthening our cooperation on what is already a strategic partnership,” said John Kirby, White House National Security Council spokesperson, in response to VOA’s question during the White House briefing Tuesday.


Kirby said the administration is “closely following the ongoing vote count” that shows Prabowo commanding a significant lead. With almost 90% of the votes counted, Prabowo holds almost 59% of the more than 150 million votes in the February 14 election.


“We've had an excellent cooperation with him since the time he was defense minister, and if he is in fact finally elected, then we look forward to continuing that relationship,” Kirby said.


Official results are not due until later in March, but Prabowo has claimed victory, and several countries have extended their congratulations, including China, Australia, the United Kingdom and others.




Alleged human rights violation


Currently serving as Indonesia’s defense minister, Prabowo has a long track record of alleged human rights violations, including the abduction and torture of activists during the 1998 ouster of his then father-in-law, former President Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years.


Prabowo’s victory is widely attributed to the support of the popular outgoing president, Joko Widodo, who last week awarded Prabowo with an honorary four-star general rank. The president’s son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, is Prabowo’s running mate, fueling accusations of nepotism.


“Prabowo’s election creates not only a bad precedent in the effort to prosecute state crimes committed by the previous government,” said Gufron Mabruri, executive director of Indonesian human rights group Imparsial. “It will also weaken enforcement of human rights in the future.”


Until 2020, Prabowo was banned from entering the U.S. due to alleged human rights violations, but he has since visited as defense minister, invited by both the Trump and Biden administrations.


Asked about potential democratic backsliding in Indonesia, Kirby said the administration will “never back away from our concerns about the need for human rights, civil rights, and all the values of democratic institutions,” and that President Joe Biden “absolutely will not shy away” about expressing such concerns.


As the United States and China compete for regional influence, Prabowo aims to continue Indonesia’s nonaligned foreign policy that has allowed Jakarta to reap massive investments from Beijing while maintaining security ties with Washington.


In Washington, concerns about Indonesia veering too close to Beijing provide a geostrategic backdrop to U.S.-Indonesia ties, said Andreyka Natalegawa, associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.


“At the same time, these broader geopolitical factors are also just strengthened by the fact that the U.S.-Indonesia partnership is strong and solid,” Natalegawa told VOA. He added that given the continuities with the outgoing Indonesian government, Washington should be comfortable in working with the new incoming administration.


There have been sporadic protests in Jakarta alleging election interference, but official results are expected to declare Prabowo as the country’s next leader in the coming weeks.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

I have been a reader of the NYT since I was a small child. I wanted to be a writer like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Baker">Russell Baker</a>. I was quoted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Safire">William Safire</a> in an op-ed. I have done some of the <a href="http://scripting.com/davenet/2002/04/10/newYorkTimesAndUserland.html">most successful work</a> of my career with the NYT. I love journalism <a href="http://scripting.com/2018/06/24/181734.html">like I love the Mets</a>. I don't expect them to do great things every season, but I do hope for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_New_York_Mets_season">1969</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_New_York_Mets_season">1986</a> every once in a while. These days I don't have much hope for the NYT returning to its former glory. I also wonder if they ever really were that great, that maybe I was just a naive young hero-seeker, growing up in Queens in the 1960s. We <i>all</i> have to work together to dig out of the hole we're in. And that means reporters have to start looking at themselves, and they have to listen to us, the people who care about the job that we need journalism to do, that it isn't doing.

## South Sudan Activist in US Charged With Trying to Export Arms Illegally for Coup Back Home

date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA

phoenix, arizona — A leading South Sudanese academic and activist living in exile in the United States has been charged in Arizona along with a Utah man born in the African nation on charges of conspiring to buy and illegally export millions of dollars' worth of weapons to overthrow the government back home. 


Peter Biar Ajak fled to the U.S. with the help of the American government four years ago, after he said South Sudan's president ordered him abducted or killed. Emergency visas were issued at the time to Ajak, now 40, and his family after they spent weeks in hiding in Kenya. He was most recently living in Maryland. 


A federal criminal complaint unsealed Monday in Arizona charges Ajak and Abraham Chol Keech, 44, of Utah, with conspiring to purchase and illegally export through a third country to South Sudan a cache of weapons in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Control Reform Act. The weapons that were considered included automatic rifles like AK-47s, grenade launchers, Stinger missile systems, hand grenades, sniper rifles, ammunition, and other export-controlled arms. 


Although the criminal complaint was made public by Justice officials, the case was still not available in the federal government's online system by Tuesday afternoon so it was unknown if the men had attorneys who could speak to the charges against them. 


"As alleged, the defendants sought to unlawfully smuggle heavy weapons and ammunition from the United States into South Sudan — a country that is subject to a U.N. arms embargo due to the violence between armed groups, which has killed and displaced thousands," Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division said in a statement. 


"Sanctions and export controls help ensure that American weapons are not used internationally to destabilize other sovereign nations," said Gary Restaino, U.S. attorney for Arizona. 


A man who answered the telephone Tuesday at the Embassy of South Sudan in Washington said the mission does not have a press officer and the ambassador was traveling and unavailable for comment. 


From 2022-23, Ajak was a postdoctoral fellow in the Belfer Center's International Security Program at the Harvard Kennedy School, focusing on state formation in South Sudan, according to the program's website. He has also been a fellow at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies of the National Defense University and a Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellow at the National Endowment for Democracy. 


Sudan gained independence from Sudan July 9, 2011, after a successful referendum. But widespread inter-ethnic violence and extreme human rights abuses by all sides continue to plague the country.

## How we learn to art

date: 2024-03-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News

<p>People learn to make art by studying previous artists. Would we want it any other way? </p>
<p>Imagine if everyone had to reinvent everything that anyone had ever invented just to make something new. </p>
<p>There is a lot of that in software, people won't put in an API so you have to rebuild the whole house just to get a window. </p>
<p>We can make progress when people don't try to lock up their ideas. </p>
<p>Individuals live just a short time, we can't do that much in a lifetime, but we are an amazing species, because we leave behind what we learn and we build. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/05/selfportrait.png"></center>We learn by studying ourselves.</div></p>
<p>So why shouldn't our machines be able to learn too? They already can do things vastly more complex than we can. We've invented a huge lever. </p>
<p>Science fiction tells us that we will lose control and be enslaved by our machines. I love those stories, like the Matrix and Battlestar Galactica. But those are stories, they didn't happen. The future is rarely so predictable. Things interact in unforseeable ways. </p>
<p>We're at dead-ends in climate and government. We need to make radical changes, and a fresh invention as radically progressive as any that has come before is now in our hands. </p>
<p><div class="divInlineImage"><center><img class="imgInline" src="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/03/05/weWillUseIt.png"></center>We're going to use it.</div></p>

## Meta's Facebook, Instagram Back Up After Global Outage

date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram were back up on Tuesday after a more than two-hour outage that was caused by a technical issue and impacted hundreds of thousands of users globally.


The disruptions started at around 10:00 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), with many users saying on rival social media platform X they had been booted out of Facebook and Instagram and were unable to log in.


"We are aware of the incident and at this time, we are not aware of any specific malicious cyber activity at this time," a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said.


At the peak of the outage, there were more than 550,000 reports of disruptions for Facebook and about 92,000 for Instagram, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com.


"Earlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services. We resolved the issue ... for everyone who was impacted," Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a post on X.


Meta Platforms, shares of which were down 1.2% in afternoon trading, has about 3.19 billion daily active users across its family of apps, which also include WhatsApp and Threads.


Its status dashboard had earlier showed the application programming interface for WhatsApp Business was also facing issues.


Though the outage for WhatsApp and Threads was much smaller, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including users.


Several employees of Meta said on anonymous messaging app Blind that they were unable to log in to their internal work systems, which left them wondering if they were laid off, according to posts seen by Reuters.


The outage was among the top trending topics on X, formerly Twitter, with the platform's owner Elon Musk taking a shot at Meta with a post that said: "If you're reading this post, it's because our servers are working."


X itself has faced several disruptions to its service after Musk's $44 billion purchase of the social media platform in October 2022, with an outage in December causing issues for more than 77,000 users in countries from the U.S. to France.

## Microsoft kills Windows Subsystem for Android

date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News

Well, that was a short run. Announced with much fanfare in 2021, Microsoft has announced it&#8217;s already killing Windows Subsystem for Android, Microsoft&#8217;s solution to run Android applications on Windows 11. Microsoft is ending support for the Windows Subsystem for Android™️ (WSA). As a result, the Amazon Appstore on Windows and all applications and games dependent on WSA will no longer be supported beginning March 5, 2025. Until then, technical support will remain available to customers. Customers that have installed the Amazon Appstore or Android apps prior to March 5, 2024, will continue to have access to those apps through the deprecation date of March 5, 2025. Please reach out to our support team for further questions at support.microsoft.com. We are grateful for the support of our developer community and remain committed to listening to feedback as we evolve experiences. ↫ Microsoft&#8217;s Learn website Whenever Microsoft offers a way or an API to run and/or develop applications for Windows, and it isn&#8217;t Win32, you can be certain they&#8217;re going to kill it within a few years.

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-03-05, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW, in case you're wondering where "still diggin!" came from -- here's the deal. I have a feeling that when I develop software it's a lot like digging a hole and then starting another, and another and using the dirt from a new hole to fill in the old holes. At any time there's more or less a constant amount of dirt and holes. It seems futile at first look, and second looks and third looks, but we do eventually get somewhere, or so we hope, maybe. It's like "even worse than it appears." Still diggin is meant to say we know it's really futile, you don't have to point that out, we never actually go anywhere or do anything, but we feel somehow that next time it really will work. It's a Vonnegut-like or Deadhead-like philosophy, which is also very Postel-like. In other words, realistic.

## Future, Civilization & Change

date: 2024-03-05, from: Om Malik blog

What is dystopia? What is technology? What is progress? What is society? What is civilization? It&#8217;s all a moving target. What seems like dystopia, seems normal eventually. I was reminded of this when I read a piece by Mahatma Gandhi, originally published in 1909. He was writing about a future now all too present around us. Everything is all &#8230;

## Running CP/M on the C128

date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News

I owned a C64 and was familiar with the C128, but this one was odd. It wasn’t running any games, color graphics or playing music. Instead, it was connected to a monochrome monitor which always displayed either a weird command line prompt or what seemed to be some boring professional writing software. I soon came to find that it was running CP/M and WordStar, one of the first word processors for microcomputers. My daily obsessive visits to the computer shop led to some friendship with the owner, to the point that he’d let me in and play with the machines. So, I played with CP/M and learned how to use WordStar. Well, in case you didn’t notice, I own a C128DCR now. This blog is about how I got CP/M, WordStar, and other fun ancient software apps running on it. ↫ Celso Martinho CP/M, of course, was the primary influence of DOS.

## Facing reality, whether it’s about Apple or the EU, is a core requirement for good management

date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News

Baldur Bjarnason has written an excellent piece to explain why, exactly, companies like Apple seem wholly incapable of working with the EU, instead of against it. He argues &#8211; quite effectively &#8211; that Apple, and US tech punditry in general, simply do not understand the EU, nor are they willing to spend even 10 minutes to understand it, which is really all you need. The core premise of the EU, its very primary function, is to enable and protect the single market. A great example of this is the ban on roaming charges &#8211; mobile phone carriers in EU are not allowed to charge extra for using mobile voice and data services in another EU country. From the EU’s perspective, taking action to prevent private parties from fragmenting and taking private control over the single market simultaneously grew the economy and increased consumer surplus. This is the operating theory behind much of the actions the EU takes regarding market regulation and product standardisation: a single market built on standards is more profitable for both businesses and consumers. ↫ Baldur Bjarnason And because Apple and its tech punditry refuse to try and understand the party they are dealing with, they get caught looking like childish idiots every time they open their mouths about it. Normally when the EU regulates a given sector, it does so with ample lead time and works with industry to make sure that they understand their obligations. Apple instead thought that the regulatory contact from the EU during the lead time to the DMA was an opportunity for it to lecture the EU on its right to exist. Then its executives made up some fiction in their own minds as to what the regulation meant, announced their changes, only to discover later that they were full of bullshit. This was entirely Apple’s own fault. For months, we’ve been hearing leaks about Apple’s talks with the EU about the Digital Market Act. Those talks were not negotiations even though Apple seems to have thought they were. Talks like those are to help companies implement incoming regulations, with some leeway for interpretation on the EU’s side to accommodate business interests. Remember what I wrote about electrical plugs? The EU is pro-business – often criticised for being essentially a pro-business entity – and not in favour of regulation for regulation’s sake. If Apple had faced reality and tried to understand the facts as they are, they would have used the talks to clarify all of these issues and more well in advance of the DMA taking effect. But they didn’t because they have caught the tech industry management disease of demanding that reality bend to their ideas and wishes. ↫ Baldur Bjarnason What a lot of people &#8211; both inside and outside the EU &#8211; do not grasp is that while we all know the EU has shortcomings and issues, in general, the EU is uncharacteristically (for a government agency) popular among EU citizens, no matter the country of origin. That&#8217;s because we, as EU citizens, and especially as EU citizens who do anything international, know just how ridiculously beneficial the EU has been for trade, business, the economy, travel, and so much more. Apple can keep acting like a whiny trust fund boy who thinks the world owes them everything, but they&#8217;ll have to deal with the consequences. Continued violation of the DMA can lead to fines of up to 10% of revenue. That&#8217;s 38 billion dollars. I secretly hope Apple keeps this childish behaviour up. It&#8217;s deeply entertaining.

Six years ago I wrote <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/03/archival-media-not-good-business.html"><i>Archival Media: Not a Good Business</i></a> and included this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5007621">table</a>. The argument went as follows:<br />
<ul>
  <li>The value that can be extracted from data decays rapidly with time.</li>
  <li>Thus companies would rather invest in current than archival data.</li>
  <li>Thus archival media and systems are a niche market.</li>
  <li>Thus archival media and systems lack the manufacturing volume to drive down prices.</li>
  <li>Thus although quasi-immortal media have low opex (running cost), they have high capex (purchase cost).</li>
  <li>Especially now interest rates are non-zero, the high capex makes the net present value of their lifetime cost high.</li>
  <li>Archival media compete with legacy generic media, which have mass-market volumes and have already amortized their R&amp;D, so have low capex but higher opex through their shorter service lives.</li>
  <li>Because they have much higher volumes and thus much more R&amp;D, generic media have much higher Kryder rates, meaning that although they need to be replaced over time, each new unit at approximately equal cost replaces several old units, reducing opex.</li>
  <li>Especially now interest rates are non-zero, the net present value of the lower capex but higher opex is likely very competitive.</li>
</ul>
Below the fold I look into why, despite this, Microsoft has been pouring money into archival system R&amp;D for about a decade.<br />

<h3>Background</h3>
Eleven years ago Facebook announced they were building entire <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2013/02/facebooks-cold-storage.html">data centers for cold storage</a>. They expected the major reason for reads accessing this data would be subpoenas. Eighteen months later I was finally able to report on Kestutis Patiejunas' talk explaining the technology and why it made sense in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html"><i>More on Facebook's "Cold Storage"</i></a>. They used two different technologies, the first exploiting legacy generic media in the form of mostly-powered-down hard drives. Facebook's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">design for this was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
aimed at limiting the worst-case power draw. It exploits the fact that this storage is at the bottom of the storage hierarchy and can tolerate significant access latency. Disks are assigned to groups in equal numbers. One group of disks is spun up at a time in rotation, so the worst-case access latency is the time needed to cycle through all the disk groups. But the worst-case power draw is only that for a single group of disks and enough compute to handle a single group.<br />
<br />
Why is this important? Because of the synergistic effects knowing the maximum power draw enables. The power supplies can be much smaller, and because the access time is not critical, need not be duplicated. Because Facebook builds entire data centers for cold storage, the data center needs much less power and cooling. It can be more like cheap warehouse space than expensive data center space. Aggregating these synergistic cost savings at data center scale leads to really significant savings.
</blockquote>
Patiejunas figured out that, only at cloud scale, the economics of archival storage could be made to work by reducing the non-media, non-system costs. This insight led to the second technology, <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">robots full of long-lived optical media</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
It has 12 Blu-ray drives for an entire rack of cartridges holding 10,000 100TB Blu-ray disks managed by a robot. When the robot loads a group of 12 fresh Blu-ray disks into the drives, the appropriate amount of data to fill them is read from the currently active hard disk group and written to them. This scheduling of the writes allows for effective use of the limited write capacity of the Blu-ray drives. If the data are ever read, a specific group has to be loaded into the drives, interrupting the flow of writes, but this is a rare occurrence. Once all 10,000 disks in a rack have been written, the disks will be loaded for reads infrequently. Most of the time the entire Petabyte rack will sit there idle.
</blockquote>
In theory Blu-ray disks have a 50-year life, but this is <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">irrelevant</a>:
<blockquote>
No-one expects the racks to sit in the data center for 50 years, at some point before then they will be obsoleted by some unknown new, much denser and more power-efficient cold storage medium
</blockquote>
Eight years ago in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2016/05/the-future-of-storage.html"><i>The Future Of Storage</i></a> I explained:<br />
<blockquote>
Every few months there is another press release announcing that some new, <a href="http://blog.dshr.org/2014/06/more-on-long-lived-media.html">quasi-immortal medium</a> such as 5D quartz or stone DVDs has solved the problem of long-term storage. But the problem stays resolutely unsolved. Why is this? Very long-lived media are inherently more expensive, and are a niche market, so they lack economies of scale. Seagate could easily make <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/news/events/other_meetings/storage09/docs/5-4_Anderson-seagate-v3_archive_study.pdf">disks with archival life</a>, but they did a study of the market for them, and discovered that no-one would pay the relatively small additional cost.  The drives currently marketed for "archival" use have a shorter warranty and a shorter MTBF than the enterprise drives, so they're not expected to have long service lives.<br />
<br />
The fundamental problem is that long-lived media only make sense at very low Kryder rates. Even if the rate is only 10%/yr, after 10 years you could store the same data in 1/3 the space. Since space in the data center racks or even at Iron Mountain isn't free, this is a powerful incentive to move old media out. If you believe that Kryder rates will get back to 30%/yr, after a decade you could store 30 times as much data in the same space.
</blockquote>
The key parameter of these archival storage systems isn't the media life, it is the write bandwidth needed to keep up with the massive flow of <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/09/more-on-facebooks-cold-storage.html">data to be archived</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
While a group of disks is spun up, any reads queued up for that group are performed. But almost all the I/O operations to this design are writes. Writes are erasure-coded, and the shards all written to different disks in the same group. In this way, while a group is spun up, all disks in the group are writing simultaneously providing huge write bandwidth. When the group is spun down, the disks in the next group take over, and the high write bandwidth is only briefly interrupted.
</blockquote>
The lesson Facebook taught a decade ago was that the keys to cost-effective archival storage were first, massive scale, and second, high write bandwidth. Microsoft has learned the lesson and has been working to develop cloud-scale, high write bandwidth systems using two quasi-immortal media, DNA and silica.<br />

I have been tracking the development of DNA as a storage medium since 2012, when I wrote <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2012/10/forcing-frequent-failures.html"><i>Forcing Frequent Failures</i></a> based on a <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/134672-harvard-cracks-dna-storage-crams-700-terabytes-of-data-into-a-single-gram">Harvard team</a> writing 700KB. Much of the recent progress has been driven by the collaboration between <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dna-storage/">Microsoft Research and the University of Washington</a>. In 2019 they published the first <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41228-8">automated write-to-read prototype system</a> (pictured), <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">which was slow</a>:<br />

Rob Carlson's <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage"><i>The Quest for a DNA Data Drive</i></a> provides a useful overview of the current state of the art. Alas he starts by using one of my pet hates, the graph showing an immense gap between the "requirements" for data storage and the production of storage media. Carlson <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">captions the graph</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Prior projections for data storage requirements estimated a global need for about 12 million petabytes of capacity by 2030. The research firm Gartner recently issued new projections, raising that estimate by 20 million petabytes. The world is not on track to produce enough of today’s storage technologies to fill that gap.
</blockquote>
<b>&lt;rant&gt;</b> Carlson's point is to suggest that there is a huge market for DNA storage. But this ignores economics. There will always be a "requirement" to store more data than the production of storage media, because some data is not valuable enough to justify the cost of storing it. The "gap" could only be filled if media were free. Customers will buy the storage systems they can afford and prioritize the data in them according to the value that can be extracted from it. <b>&lt;/rant&gt;</b>.<br />
<br />
The size of the market for DNA storage systems depends upon their cost. In 2018's <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html"><i>DNA's Niche in the Storage Market</i></a> I imagined myself as the marketing person for a DNA storage system and posed these challenges:<br />
<blockquote>
Engineers, your challenge is to increase the speed of synthesis by a factor of a quarter of a trillion, while reducing the cost by a factor of fifty trillion, in less than 10 years while spending no more than $24M/yr.<br />
<br />
Finance team, your challenge is to persuade the company to spend $24M a year for the next 10 years for a product that can then earn about $216M a year for 10 years.
</blockquote>
Carlson is realistic about the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">engineering challenges</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
For a DNA drive to compete with today’s archival tape drives, it must be able to write about 2 gigabits per second, which at demonstrated DNA data storage densities is about 2 billion bases per second. To put that in context, I estimate that the total global market for synthetic DNA today is no more than about 10 terabases per year, which is the equivalent of about 300,000 bases per second over a year. The entire DNA synthesis industry would need to grow by approximately 4 orders of magnitude just to compete with a single tape drive.
</blockquote>
One of the speed-ups that is needed is <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">chip-based massive parallelism</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
One of our goals was to build a semiconductor chip to enable high-density, high-throughput DNA synthesis. <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abi6714">That chip</a>, which we completed in 2021, demonstrated that it is possible to digitally control electrochemical processes in millions of 650-nanometer-diameter wells.
</blockquote>
It was faster, but it's chemistry had <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">problems</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The main problem is that it employs a volatile, corrosive, and toxic organic solvent (<a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a>), which no engineer wants anywhere near the electronics of a working data center.<br />
<br />
Moreover, based on a sustainability analysis of a theoretical DNA data center performed my colleagues at Microsoft, I conclude that the volume of acetonitrile required for just one large data center, never mind many large data centers, would become logistically and economically prohibitive.
</blockquote>
Although it is the industry standard, this isn't the only way to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">write DNA</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Fortunately, there is a different emerging technology for constructing DNA that does not require such solvents, but instead uses a benign salt solution. Companies like <a href="https://www.dnascript.com/">DNA Script</a> and <a href="https://molecularassemblies.com/">Molecular Assemblies</a> are commercializing automated systems that use enzymes to synthesize DNA. These techniques are replacing traditional chemical DNA synthesis for some applications in the biotechnology industry. The current generation of systems use either simple plumbing or light to control synthesis reactions. But it’s difficult to envision how they can be scaled to achieve a high enough throughput to enable a DNA data-storage device operating at even a fraction of 2 gigabases per second.
</blockquote>
The Microsft/UW chip is an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/dna-data-storage">alternative way to control enzymatic synthesis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The University of Washington and Microsoft team, collaborating with the enzymatic synthesis company Ansa Biotechnologies, recently took the first step toward this device. Using our high-density chip, we successfully demonstrated <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00044">electrochemical control of single-base enzymatic additions</a>.
</blockquote>
The link is to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.3c00044"><i>Spatially Selective Electrochemical Cleavage of a Polymerase-Nucleotide Conjugate</i></a> by Jake A. Smith <i>et al</i>:<br />
<blockquote>
Novel enzymatic methods are poised to become the dominant processes for de novo synthesis of DNA, promising functional, economic, and environmental advantages over the longstanding approach of phosphoramidite synthesis. Before this can occur, however, enzymatic synthesis methods must be parallelized to enable production of multiple DNA sequences simultaneously. As a means to this parallelization, we report a polymerase-nucleotide conjugate that is cleaved using electrochemical oxidation on a microelectrode array. The developed conjugate maintains polymerase activity toward surface-bound substrates with single-base control and detaches from the surface at mild oxidative voltages, leaving an extendable oligonucleotide behind. Our approach readies the way for enzymatic DNA synthesis on the scale necessary for DNA-intensive applications such as DNA data storage or gene synthesis.
</blockquote>
This has, as the article points out, potential for dramatically reducing the current cost of writing DNA, but it is still many orders of magnitude away from being competitive with a tape drive. The <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/search?q=Pangloss&max-results=20&by-date=true">good Dr. Pangloss</a> can continue to enjoy the optimism for many more years.<br />
<h3>Silica</h3>
The idea of writing data into fused silica with a femtosecond laser is at least a <a href="https://www.storagenewsletter.com/2014/10/31/rd-hitachi-rw-of-digital-data-in-fused-silica-glass/">decade and a half old</a><br />
<blockquote>
In 2009, Hitachi focused on fused silica known for its excellent heat and water resistance as a recording medium for long-term digital storage. After proposing the use of computed tomography to read data recorded with a femtosecond pulse laser, fused silica glass was confirmed as an effective storage medium. Applying this technology, it is possible to achieve multi-layer recording by changing the laser’s focal point to form microscopic regions (dots) with differing refractive indices. In 2012, a method was developed with Kyoto University to read the recorded dots in 4 layers using an optical microscope (recording density equivalent to a CD), and in 2013, 26 layer recording was achieved (recording density equivalent to a DVD). In order to increase recording density for practical applications, one means is to increase the number of recording layers. At the 100-layer level of recording density equivalent to a Blu-ray disc however issues arose in dot quality degradation and read errors resulting from crosstalk of data recorded in other layers.
</blockquote>
But in the last few years Microsoft Research has taken this idea and run with it, as they report in a 68-author paper at SOSP entitled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208"><i>Project Silica: Towards Sustainable Cloud Archival Storage in Glass</i></a>. It is a fascinating paper that should be read by anyone interest in archival storage.
Like <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2018/02/dnas-niche-in-storage-market.html">me</a>, the authors are skeptical of the near-term prospects for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">DNA storage</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
Technologies like DNA storage offer the promise of an extremely dense media for long-term data storage. However, the high costs and low throughputs of oligonucleotide synthesis and sequencing continue to hamper the technology’s feasibility. The total amount of data demonstrably stored in DNA remains on the order of MBs, and building a functional storage system that can offer reasonable SLAs underpinned by DNA is a substantial challenge. Alternative DNA-based technologies like dNAM attempt to bypass costly sequencing and synthesis steps, sacrificing density down to densities comparable with magnetic tape.
</blockquote>
Hence their focus on a medium with, in theory, a somewhat lower volumetric density. From their <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">abstract</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This paper presents Silica: the first cloud storage system for archival data underpinned by quartz glass, an extremely resilient media that allows data to be left in situ indefinitely. The hardware and software of Silica have been co-designed and co-optimized from the media up to the service level with sustainability as a primary objective. The design follows a cloud-first, data-driven methodology underpinned by principles derived from analyzing the archival workload of a large public cloud service.
</blockquote>
Their analysis of the workload of a tape-based cloud archival storage system in Section 2 <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">shows that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
on average for every MB read there are 47 MBs written, and for every read operation there are 174 writes. We can see some variation across months, but writes always dominate by over an order of magnitude.<br />
...<br />
Small files dominate the workload, with 58.7% of the reads for files of 4 MiB or smaller.  However, these reads only contribute 1.2% of the volume of data read. Files larger than 256 MiB comprise around 85% of bytes read but less than 2% of total read requests. Additionally, there is a long tail of request sizes: there is ∼ 10 orders of magnitude between the smallest and largest requested file sizes.<br />
...<br />
We observe a variability in the workload within data centers, with up to 7 orders of magnitude difference between the median and the tail, as well as large variability across different data centers.<br />
...<br />
At the granularity of a day, the peak daily [ingress] rate is ∼16x higher than the mean daily rate. As the aggregation time increases beyond 30 days, the peak over mean ratio decreases significantly down to only ∼2, indicating that the average write rate is similar across different 30-day windows.<br />
...<br />
To summarize, as expected for archival storage, the workload is <i>heavily write-dominated</i>. However, unexpectedly, the IO operations are dominated by <i>small file accesses</i>.

Subramanian Muralidhar and a team from Facebook, USC and Princeton had a paper at the 2014 OSDI that described Facebook's warm layer above the two cold storage layers and below <a href="https://www.usenix.org/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf">Haystack</a>, the hot storage layer. Section 3 of <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-muralidhar.pdf"><i>f4: Facebook's Warm BLOB Storage System</i></a> provides workload data for this layer, which filters out most of the IOPS before they hit the archival layers. I explained in <a href="https://blog.dshr.org/2014/10/facebooks-warm-storage.html"><i>Facebook's Warm Storage</i></a> that:<br />
<blockquote>
A BLOB is a Binary Large OBject. Each type of BLOB contains a single type of immutable binary content, such as photos, videos, documents, etc.<br />
...<br />
Figure 3 shows that the rate of I/O requests to BLOBs drops rapidly through time. The rates for different types of BLOB drop differently, but all 9 types have dropped by 2 orders of magnitude within 8 months, and all but 1 (profile photos) have dropped by an order of magnitude within the first week.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of Facebook's BLOBs are warm, as shown in Figure 5 - notice the scale goes from 80-100%. Thus the vast majority of the BLOBs generate I/O rates at least 2 orders of magnitude less than recently generated BLOBs.

Note these important differences between Microsoft's and Facebook's storage hierarchies:<br />
<ul>
<li>Microsoft stores generic data and depends upon user action to migrate it down the hierarchy to the archive layer, whereas Facebook stores 9 specific types of application data which is migrated automatically based upon detailed knowledge of the workload for each of the types.</li>
<li>Because Facebook can migrate data automatically, it can interpose a warm layer above the archive layer of the hierarchy, and because it has detailed knowledge about the behavior of each of the data types it can make good decision about when to move each type down the hierarchy.</li>
<li>Because the warm layer responds to the vast majority of the read requests and schedules the downward migrations, Facebook's archive layer's IOPS are a steady flow of large writes with very few reads, making efficient use of the hardware.</li>

Contrast Facebook's scheduled ingest flow with the bursty ingest rate shown in Figure 2 of the Silica paper, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">which finds that</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
At the granularity of a day, the peak daily rate is ∼16x higher than the mean daily rate.
</blockquote>
Another interesting aspect of the Silica design is that the technologies, and thus the hardware, used for writing and reading are completely different. The authors point out the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">implications for the design</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
As different technologies are used to read and write, after a platter is written it must be fully read using the same technology that will be used to read it subsequently. This happens before a platter is stored in the library and any staged write data is deleted.<br />
<br />
This design has an interesting consequence: during the period when user data is being written into the library, the workload is going to become <i>read</i>-dominated. Every byte written must be read to be verified, in addition to the user reads.  The read bandwidth has to be provisioned for peak user read rate, however the read workloads are very bursty, so read drive utilization is extremely low on average. Thus, the verification workload simply utilizes what would otherwise be idle read drives.
</blockquote>
Using separate write and read drives has <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">two advantages</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
This allows independent scaling of read and write throughput.  Additionally, this design allows us to create the first storage system that offers true <i>air-gap-by-design</i>: the robotics are unable to insert a glass platter into a write drive once the glass media has been written.
</blockquote>
Since the majority of reads are for verification, the design needs to make specific provision for <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">user reads</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
To enable high drive efficiency, two platters can be mounted simultaneously in a read drive: one undergoing verification, and one servicing a customer read. Customer traffic is prioritized over verification, with the read drive switching away when a platter is mounted for a customer read. As soon as the customer platter stops being accessed, the read drive has the ability to quickly switch to the other platter and continue verification. This is similar to avoiding head-of-line blocking of mice flows by elephant flows in networked systems.
</blockquote>
Like Facebook's, the prototype Silica systems are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">data-center size</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
A <i>Silica library</i> is a sequence of contiguous write, read, and storage racks interconnected by a platter delivery system.  Along all racks there are parallel horizontal rails that span the entire library. We refer to a side of the library (spanning all racks) as a <i>panel</i>. A set of <i>free roaming</i> robots called <i>shuttles</i> are used to move platters between locations.<br />
...<br />
A read rack contains multiple read drives. Each read drive is independent and has slots into which platters are inserted and removed. The number of shuttles active on a panel is limited to twice the number of read drives in the panel. The write drive is full-rack-sized and writes multiple platters concurrently.
</blockquote>
Their performance evaluation focuses on the ability to respond to read requests within 15 hours. Their cost evaluation, like Facebook's, focuses on the savings from using warehouse-type space to house the equipment, although is isn't clear that they have actually done so. The rest of their cost evaluation is somewhat hand-wavy, as is natural for a system that <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3600006.3613208">isn't yet in production</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
The Silica read drives use polarization microscopy, which is a commoditized technique widely used in many applications and is low-cost. Currently, system cost in Silica is dominated by the write drives, as they use femtosecond lasers which are currently expensive and used in niche applications. This highlights the importance of resource proportionality in the system, as write drive utilization needs to be maximized in order to minimize costs. As the Silica technology proliferates, it will drive up the demand for femtosecond lasers, commoditizing the technology.
</blockquote>
I'm skeptical of this last point. Archival systems are a niche in the IT market, and one on which companies are loath to spend money, The only customers for systems like Silica are the large cloud providers, who will be reluctant to commit their archives to technology owned by a competitor. Unless a mass-market application for femtosecond lasers emerges, the scope for cost reduction is limited.<br />

## European crash tester says carmakers must bring back physical controls

date: 2024-03-05, from: OS News

The European organisation for crash testing and car safety, Euro NCAP has announced that starting in 2026, cars will need physical controls in their interiors to gain the highest safety ratings. &#8220;The overuse of touchscreens is an industry-wide problem, with almost every vehicle-maker moving key controls onto central touchscreens, obliging drivers to take their eyes off the road and raising the risk of distraction crashes,&#8221; said Matthew Avery, Euro NCAP&#8217;s director of strategic development. &#8220;New Euro NCAP tests due in 2026 will encourage manufacturers to use separate, physical controls for basic functions in an intuitive manner, limiting eyes-off-road time and therefore promoting safer driving,&#8221; he said. ↫ Jonathan M. Gitlin at Ars Technica Excellent news, and it&#8217;s taken regulators and safety organisations way too long to long to adapt to the growing menace of touch screens in cars.

## Why Are There So Many Methane Satellites?

date: 2024-03-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTQ3MTg1NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NTM0ODYxM30.UBPNBLWGUZId7rH3kzmGRfufyZCFqMpTCed9ISu7NQY/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">On Monday afternoon, a satellite the size of a washing machine hitched a ride on a SpaceX rocket and was launched into orbit. MethaneSAT, as the new satellite is called, is the latest to join more than a dozen other instruments currently circling the Earth monitoring emissions of the ultra-powerful greenhouse gas methane. But it won’t be the last. Over the next several months, at least two additional methane-detecting satellites from the U.S. and Japan are scheduled to join the fleet. </p><p>There’s a joke among scientists that there are so many methane-detecting satellites in space that they are reducing global warming — not just by providing essential data about emissions, but by blocking radiation from the sun.</p><p>So why do we keep launching more?</p><p>Despite the small army of probes in orbit, and an increasingly large fleet of methane-detecting planes and drones closer to the ground, our ability to identify where methane is leaking into the atmosphere is still far too limited. Like carbon dioxide, sources of methane around the world are numerous and diffuse. They can be natural, like wetlands and oceans, or man-made, like decomposing manure on farms, rotting waste in landfills, and leaks from oil and gas operations. </p><p>There are big, unanswered questions about methane, about which sources are driving the most emissions, and consequently, about tackling climate change, that scientists say MethaneSAT will help solve. But even then, some say we’ll need to launch even more instruments into space to really get to the bottom of it all.</p><p>Measuring methane from space only began in 2009 with the launch of the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite, or GOSAT, by Japan’s Aerospace Exploration Agency. Previously, most of the world’s methane detectors were on the ground in North America. GOSAT enabled scientists to develop a more geographically diverse understanding of major sources of methane to the atmosphere.</p><p>Soon after, the Environmental Defense Fund, which led the development of MethaneSAT, began campaigning for better data on methane emissions. Through its own, on-the-ground measurements, <a href="https://www.edf.org/climate-impacts-methane-emissions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the group discovered</a> that the Environmental Protection Agency’s estimates of leaks from U.S. oil and gas operations were totally off. EDF took this as a call to action. Because methane has such a strong warming effect, but also breaks down after about a decade in the atmosphere, curbing methane emissions can slow warming in the near-term.</p><p>“Some call it the <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-methane-limits-warming" target="_blank">low hanging fruit</a>,” Steven Hamburg, the chief scientist at EDF leading the MethaneSAT project, said during a press conference on Friday. “I like to call it the fruit lying on the ground. We can really reduce those emissions and we can do it rapidly and see the benefits.”</p><p>But in order to do that, we need a much better picture than what GOSAT or other satellites like it can provide.</p><p>In the years since GOSAT launched, the field of methane monitoring has exploded. Today, there are two broad categories of methane instruments in space. Area flux mappers, like GOSAT, take global snapshots. They can show where methane concentrations are generally higher, and even identify exceptionally large leaks — so-called <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj4351" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“ultra-emitters.”</a> But the vast majority of leaks, big and small, are invisible to these instruments. Each pixel in a GOSAT image is 10 kilometers wide. Most of the time, there’s no way to zoom into the picture and see which facilities are responsible.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

That means they provide geographically limited data — they have to be programmed to aim their lenses at very specific targets. But within each image is much more actionable data. </p><p>For example, GHGSat, a private company based in Canada, operates a constellation of 12 point-source satellites, each one about the size of a microwave oven. Oil and gas companies and government agencies pay GHGSat to help them identify facilities that are leaking. Jean-Francois Gauthier, the director of business development at GHGSat, told me that each image taken by one of their satellites is 12 kilometers wide, but the resolution for each pixel is 25 meters. A snapshot of the Permian Basin, a major oil and gas producing region in Texas, might contain hundreds of oil and gas wells, owned by a multitude of companies, but GHGSat can tell them apart and assign responsibility.</p><p>“We’ll see five, 10, 15, 20 different sites emitting at the same time and you can differentiate between them,” said Gauthier. “You can see them very distinctly on the map and be able to say, alright, that’s an unlit flare, and you can tell which company it is, too.” Similarly, GHGSat can look at a sprawling petrochemical complex and identify the exact tank or pipe that has sprung a leak.</p><p>But between this extremely wide-angle lens, and the many finely-tuned instruments pointing at specific targets, there’s a gap. “It might seem like there’s a lot of instruments in space, but we don’t have the kind of coverage that we need yet, believe it or not,” Andrew Thorpe, a research technologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory told me. He has been working with the nonprofit Carbon Mapper on a new constellation of point source imagers, the first of which is supposed to launch later this year.</p><p>The reason why we don’t have enough coverage has to do with the size of the existing images, their resolution, and the amount of time it takes to get them. One of the challenges, Thorpe said, is that it’s very hard to get a continuous picture of any given leak. Oil and gas equipment can spring leaks at random. They can leak continuously or intermittently. If you’re just getting a snapshot every few weeks, you may not be able to tell how long a leak lasted, or you might miss a short but significant plume. Meanwhile, oil and gas fields are also changing on a weekly basis, Joost de Gouw, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, told me. New wells are being drilled in new places — places those point-source imagers may not be looking at. </p><p>“There’s a lot of potential to miss emissions because we’re not looking,” he said. “If you combine that with clouds — clouds can obscure a lot of our observations — there are still going to be a lot of times when we’re not actually seeing the methane emissions.”</p><p>De Gouw hopes MethaneSAT will help resolve one of the big debates about methane leaks. Between the millions of sites that release small amounts of methane all the time, and the handful of sites that exhale massive plumes infrequently, which is worse? What fraction of the total do those bigger emitters represent?</p><p>Paul Palmer, a professor at the University of Edinburgh who studies the Earth’s atmospheric composition, is hopeful that it will help pull together a more comprehensive picture of what’s driving changes in the atmosphere. Around the turn of the century, methane levels pretty much leveled off, he said. But then, around 2007, they started to grow again, and have since accelerated. Scientists have reached different conclusions about why.</p><p>“There’s lots of controversy about what the big drivers are,” Palmer told me. Some think it’s related to oil and gas production increasing. Others — and he’s in this camp — think it’s related to warming wetlands. “Anything that helps us would be great.”</p><p>MethaneSAT sits somewhere between the global mappers and point source imagers. It will take larger images than GHGSat, each one 200 kilometers wide, which means it will be able to cover more ground in a single day. Those images will also contain finer detail about leaks than GOSAT, but they won’t necessarily be able to identify exactly which facilities the smaller leaks are coming from. Also, unlike with GHGSat, MethaneSAT’s data will be freely available to the public.</p><p>EDF, which raised $88 million for the project and spent nearly a decade working on it, says that one of MethaneSAT’s main strengths will be to provide much more accurate basin-level emissions estimates. That means it will enable researchers to track the emissions of the entire Permian Basin over time, and compare it with other oil and gas fields in the U.S. and abroad. Many countries and companies are <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-methane-limits-warming" target="_self">making pledges to reduce their emissions</a>, and MethaneSAT will provide data on a relevant scale that can help track progress, Maryann Sargent, a senior project scientist at Harvard University who has been working with EDF on MethaneSAT, told me.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

<small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Courtesy of MethaneSAT</small></p><p>It could also help the Environmental Protection Agency understand whether its <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-epa-methane-rules" target="_self">new methane regulations</a> are working. It could help with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_5776" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">development of new standards</a> for natural gas being imported into Europe. At the very least, it will help oil and gas buyers differentiate between products associated with higher or lower methane intensities. It will also enable fossil fuel companies who measure their own methane emissions to compare their performance to regional averages.</p><p>MethaneSAT won’t be able to look at every source of methane emissions around the world. The project is limited by how much data it can send back to Earth, so it has to be strategic. Sargent said they are limiting data collection to 30 targets per day, and in the near term, those will mostly be oil and gas producing regions. They aim to map emissions from 80% of global oil and gas production in the first year. The outcome could be revolutionary.</p><p>“We can look at the entire sector with high precision and track those emissions, quantify them and track them over time. That’s a first for empirical data for any sector, for any greenhouse gas, full stop,” Hamburg told reporters on Friday.</p><p><span></span>But this still won’t be enough, said Thorpe of NASA. He wants to see the next generation of instruments start to look more closely at natural sources of emissions, like wetlands. “These types of emissions are really, really important and very poorly understood,” he said. So I think there’s a heck of a lot of potential to work towards the sectors that have been really hard to do with current technologies.”</p>

## A Car Buyer’s Guide to the 2024 EV Tax Credit

date: 2024-03-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDk3NTc1Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0NjkzNzczMX0.qtbQfVSxRZulOt_8bLW4MRocpPYH9OsL7yS_gRzJP3I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	The Department of Treasury 
	<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1379" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2023-06822/section-30d-new-clean-vehicle-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new rules</a> last year that will determine which new electric vehicles, purchased for personal use, will qualify for <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/credits-for-new-clean-vehicles-purchased-in-2023-or-after" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a $7,500 tax credit</a>. They went into effect on April 18, 2023, and last for the next decade or so.
</p><p>
	These new tax credit rules are complicated. The list of cars that qualify for the new tax credit can change from year to year — and even month to month. Many buyers in the EV market might have a few questions, including: Should I buy that new car now, or should I wait? Which cars qualify for the current tax credit, and which ones will earn the new one?
</p><p>
	This is Heatmap’s guide to the new tax credit, why it matters, and what to keep in mind as you go EV shopping.</p><h3>Who is affected by these new rules?</h3><br/><p>If you’re an ordinary American buying a brand-new EV to run errands and pick up the kids, these new rules apply to you. They will determine which cars you can get a federally funded discount on.</p><p>If you’re not buying a <em>new</em> car for <em>personal</em> use — because you’re getting it for your business, say, or because you’re buying a used EV — these new rules don’t apply to you. But you may qualify for other new subsidies. We get into those below.</p><p>And even if you <em>are </em>in that first category, you may discover it’s much cheaper to lease a new EV instead of buying it outright. We get into why below, too.</p><h3>Why are these new rules important?</h3><br/><p>They completely change how the United States approaches the EV industry.</p><p>During the Bush and Obama administrations, the U.S. was focused mostly on getting automakers to begin to experiment with EVs. So it discounted <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409#vehicles-purchased-before-august-17-2022" target="_blank">the first 200,000 or so electric vehicles</a> that each manufacturer sold by up to $7,500. If a company had cumulatively sold more than that number over time, as Tesla and General Motors eventually did, then the discount expired. By 2022, that had led to a peculiar situation where foreign automakers, such as Hyundai, could use the subsidy, while some of the largest American automakers couldn’t.</p><p>Now, U.S. policy is focused on two goals: (1) building up a domestic supply chain for EVs and (2) getting more EVs on the road. So the tax break is completely uncapped — any automaker can use it as many times as possible if they meet the criteria.</p><p>But many new requirements apply: Only cars that undergo final assembly in North America will qualify for <em>any </em>of the tax credit. Then, cars with a battery that was more than 50% made in North America will qualify for a $3,750 subsidy. And cars where at least 40% of the “critical minerals” used come from the U.S. or a country with whom we have a free-trade agreement will qualify for another $3,750 subsidy.</p><p>Those percentage-based requirements will ramp up over time. By 2029, for instance, 100% of a car’s battery and battery components must be made in North America.</p><h3>Why is this change happening now?</h3><br/><p>Because Congress said so. The Inflation Reduction Act, which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate passed last year, mandated this change to the EV tax credit as part of its broad expansion of American climate policy.<span></span><br/></p><h3>Will more EVs or fewer EVs qualify for a subsidy under those new rules?</h3><br><p>Initially, fewer EVs will receive a subsidy under the new rules, Biden officials say. On a press call with reporters, a senior Treasury official argued that more cars will eventually qualify under the new rules than qualified under the old ones.</p><h3>Which EVs will qualify under the new rules in 2024?</h3><br/><p>
	This year, at least 15 car or light trucks will receive some or all of the credit. Only some of those vehicles will qualify for the full $7,500 tax credit; some will qualify for a partial $3,750 tax credit. Here is the full list of qualifying models, along with the amount of the tax credit that they will earn:
</p><p>
 • Audi Q5 TFSI e Quattro PHEV ($3,750)<br/>
 • Cadillac LYRIQ ($7,500)
	• Chevrolet Bolt ($7,500)<br/>
	• Chevrolet Bolt EUV ($7,500)<br/>
	• Chrysler Pacifica PHEV ($7,500)<br/>
	• Ford Escape Plug-in Hybrid ($3,750)<br/>
	• Ford F-150 Lightning, Standard & Extended Range ($7,500)<br/>
	• Jeep Wrangler PHEV 4xe ($3,750)<br/>
	• Jeep Grand Cherokee PHEV 4xe ($3,750)<br/>
	• Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring ($3,750)<br/>
	• Rivian R1S, Dual Large & Quad Large ($3,750)<br/>
	• Rivian R1T, Dual Large, Dual Max, & Quad Large ($3,750)<br/>
	• Tesla Model X Long Range ($7,500)<br/>
	• Tesla Model 3 Performance ($7,500)<br/>
	• Tesla Model 3 Long Range AWD ($3,500)<br/>
	• Tesla Model Y AWD,  Rear-Wheel Drive, & Performance ($7,500)<br/>
• Volkswagen ID.4 AWD PRO, PRO, S, & Standard ($7,500)<br/>
</p><p>
	Some vehicles that earned the full tax credit in 2023, such as the Ford Mustang Mach E, don’t qualify for any benefit as of January 2, 2024.
</p><h3>Are there any EVs that definitely do not qualify for either tax credit?</h3><br><p>Yes. A few examples: The Hummer EV, which costs more than $110,000 a piece, won’t qualify for either the new or old tax credit — it’s too expensive. And the Polestar 2 won’t qualify because it’s <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/americans-are-willing-to-pay-more-to-reject-chinese-evs?draft=1" target="_self">assembled in China</a>.</p><h3>Have there been any other recent changes to the EV tax credit? </h3><br><p>Yes. Starting this year, the U.S. is preventing cars <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024" target="_blank">that receive too much manufacturing input</a> from a “foreign entity of concern” — that is, China — from qualifying for <em></em>any<em> </em>of the tax credit. This has reduced the number of vehicles that qualify for the $7,500 bonus.</p><p>This year, the government will also allow buyers <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/EV-Tax-Credit-FAQs.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to refund their EV tax credit at the dealership</a>. That means buyers can now get up to a $7,500 discount at the moment when they buy their car instead of waiting until they file their taxes in the following year.</p><h3>Are there any income caps on the $7,500 tax credit?</h3><br><p>Yes. A married couple must have an adjusted gross income of less than $300,000 a year, and a single filer must have an AGI of less than $150,000 a year, to qualify for any aspect of the subsidy. A head-of-household must have an income of less than $225,000 a year.</p><h3>Lots of rules! Is there a price limit on the EVs that can qualify for this new subsidy?</h3><br><p>Yes. Under the proposed rule, cars must have an MSRP below $55,000 to qualify for the credit. Vans, pickup trucks, and SUVs must have an MSRP below $80,000.</p><h3>If my household makes more than that, do I have any other options?</h3><br><p>Yes. The Inflation Reduction Act also included a new $7,500 tax credit for EVs used for any commercial purpose. The Treasury Department is <em>expected </em>to interpret that provision to cover leasing, but it hasn’t announced the guidelines for that rule yet, so we don’t know for sure.</p><p>But the provision will probably tilt new EV drivers toward leasing their car rather than buying it outright, because the dealer should — emphasis on <em>should —</em> offer relative discounts on leasing vehicles as compared to buying them.</p><h3>There’s no way I can afford a new EV. Does the IRA contain any subsidies for buying a used EV?</h3><br><p>Yes. There’s also <a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/used-clean-vehicle-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">a new $4,000 tax credit</a> for buying a used EV that costs $25,000 or less. It went into effect on January 1, 2023, so you can go ahead and use it today.</p><p>But note that it has even stricter income limits: Married couples can only take advantage of it if they make $150,000 or less, and other filers if they make $75,000 or less.</p><h3>Out of the curiosity, what models qualified for the $7,500 credit before April 18?</h3><br><p>Here’s the list of cars that qualified for the $7,500 tax credit before April 18, 2023, <a href="https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to the Department of Energy</a>.</p><p>• Audi Q5 TFSI e Quattro (PHEV)<br/>• BMW 330e *<br/>• BMW X5 xDrive45e**<br/>• Cadillac Lyriq<br/>• Chevrolet Bolt<br/>• Chevrolet Bolt EUV<br/>• Chevrolet Silverado EV<br/>• Chrysler Pacifica PHEV<br/>• Ford E-Transit<br/>• Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid *<br/>• Ford F-150 Lightning<br/>• Ford Mustang Mach-E<br/>• Genesis Electrified GV70<br/>• Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe<br/>• Jeep Wrangler 4xe<br/>• Lincoln Aviator Grand Touring *<br/>• Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring *<br/>• Nissan Leaf<br/>• Nissan Leaf (S, SL, SV, and Plus models)<br/>• Rivian R1S<br/>• Rivian R1T<br/>• Tesla Model 3 Long Range<br/>• Tesla Model 3 Performance<br/>• Tesla Model 3 RWD<br/>• Tesla Model Y All-Wheel Drive<br/>• Tesla Model Y Long Range<br/>• Tesla Model Y Performance<br/>• Volkswagen ID.4<br/>• Volkswagen ID.4 AWD, Pro, and S models<br/>• Volvo S60 PHEV *<br/>• Volvo S60 Extended Range<br/>• Volvo S60 T8 Recharge (Extended Range)</p><p>* These cars don’t qualify for the full $7,500 subsidy, although they all receive at least a $5,400 tax credit.</p><p>** Only some BMW X5 xDrive45e vehicles qualify — it depends where the car was made. Check the VIN or ask the dealership to confirm it was made in North America before buying.</p></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br><p><br/></p><p>

## Pluralistic: You can't shop your way out of a monopoly (05 Mar 2024)

date: 2024-03-05, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links You can't shop your way out of a monopoly: Any election where you vote with your wallet will be won by the people with the thickest wallets. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Podcasts, events and more. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. You can't shop your way out of a monopoly (permalink) If you're running a business, you can either invest at being good at your business, or good at Google SEO. Choose the former and your customers will love you &#8211; but they won't be able to find you, thanks to the people who choose the latter. And if you're going to invest in top-notch SEO, why bother investing in quality at all? For more than a decade, Google has promised that it would do something about "lead gens" &#8211; services that spoof Google into thinking that they are local businesses, pushing down legit firms on both regular search and Google Maps (these downranked businesses invested in quality, not SEO, remember). Search for a roofer, a plumber, an electrician, or a locksmith (especially a locksmith), and most or all of the results will be lead-gens. They'll take your call, pretend to be a local business, and then call up some half-qualified bozo to come out and charge you four times the going rate for substandard work: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/business/fake-online-locksmiths-may-be-out-to-pick-your-pocket-too.html Some of them just take your money and they "go back to the shop for a tool" and never return: https://www.riverfronttimes.com/news/when-a-fake-business-used-a-real-st-louis-address-things-got-weird-32087998 Google has been promising to fix this since the late aughts, and to be fair, it's a little better. There was once a time when a map of Manhattan showed more locksmiths than taxis: https://blumenthals.com/blog/2009/02/18/google-maps-proves-more-locksmiths-in-nyc-than-cabs/ But GMaps is trapped in the enshittification squeeze. On the one hand, the company wants to provide a good and reliable map. On the other hand, the company makes money selling "ads" that are actually payola, where a business can pay to get to the top of the listings or get displayed on the map itself. Zoom out of Google's map of central London and the highlighted landmarks are a hilarious mix of "organic" and paid listings: the British Museum, Buckingham Palace, the Barbican, the London Eye&#8230;and a random oral and maxillofacial clinic in the financial district: https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie/status/1764711667663831455 Hell of a job "organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible and useful," Big G. Doubtless the average Londoner finds the presence of this clinic super helpful in orienting themselves relative to the map on their phone screens, and it's a real service to tourists hoping to hit all the major landmarks. It's not just Maps users who'd noticed the rampant enshittification. Even the original design team is so horrified they're moved to speak out about the moral injury they experience seeing the product they worked so hard on turned into a giant pile of shit: https://twitter.com/elizlaraki/status/1727351922254852182 Now, when it comes to locksmiths, I'm lucky. My neighborhood in Burbank includes the wonderful Golden State Lock and Safe, which has been in business since 1942: https://www.goldenstatelock.com/ But you wouldn't know it from searching GMaps for a locksmith near me. That search turns up a long list of scams: https://www.google.com/maps/search/locksmith/@34.1750451,-118.369948,14z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu It also turns up plenty of Keyme machines &#8211; these are private-equity backed, self-serve key-cutting machines placed in grocery stores. Despite Keyme calling itself a "locksmith," it's just a badly secured, overcaptilized, enshittification-bound system for collecting and retaining shapefiles for the keys to millions of homes, cross-referenced with billing information that will make it easy for the eventual hackers to mass-produce keys for all those poor suckers' houses. (Hilariously, Keyme claims to be an "AI" company): https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200114005194/en/KeyMe-Raises-35-Million-to-Further-Its-Mission-of-Building-the-Premier-Locksmith-Services-Company-in-the-Nation But despite the fact that you can literally see the Golden State storefront from Google Streetview, Google Maps claims to have no knowledge of it. Instead, Streetview labels Golden State "Keyme" &#8211; and displays a preview showing a locksmith using a tool to break into a jeep (I'd dearly love to know how the gadget next to the Slurpee machine at the 7-Eleven will drive itself to your jeep and unlock the door for you when you lose your keys): https://www.google.com/maps/place/KeyMe+Locksmiths/@34.1752624,-118.3487531,3a,75y,350.19h,90.21t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssHrtqjqvgFir3NBauMy13Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m15!1m8!3m7!1s0x80c2959cd65dbb1b:0x4b3744cf87492a71!2sBurbank+Blvd+%26+N+Hollywood+Way,+Burbank,+CA+91505!3b1!8m2!3d34.1750025!4d-118.3493484!16s%2Fg%2F11f37_3lq8!3m5!1s0x80c2951cedbf4d39:0xe8ff9fd5872e66e9!8m2!3d34.1755176!4d-118.349!16s%2Fg%2F11mw7nr4fx?entry=ttu It's pretty clear to me what's going on here. Keyme has hired some SEO creeps and/or paid off Google, flooding the zone with listings for its machines. Meanwhile, Golden State, being merely good at locksmithing, has lost the SEO wars. Perhaps Golden State could shift some of its emphasis from being good at locksmithing in order to get better at SEO, but this is a race that will always be won by the firm that puts the most into SEO, which will always be the firm that puts the least into quality. Whenever I write about this stuff, people inevitably ask me which search engine they should use, if not Google? And there's the rub. Google used predatory pricing and anticompetitive mergers to acquire a 90% search market-share. The company spends more than $26b/year buying default position in every place where you might possibly encounter a new search engine. This created the "kill zone" &#8211; the VC's term of art for businesses that no one will invest in, because Google makes sure that no one will ever find out it exists: https://www.theverge.com/23802382/search-engine-google-neeva-android That's why the only serious competitor to Google is Bing, another Big Tech company (Bing is also the primary source of results on Duckduckgo, which is why DDG sometimes makes exceptions for Microsoft's privacy-invading tracking): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo#Controversies Google tells us that the quid-pro-quo of search monopolization is search excellence. The hundreds of billions it makes every year through monopoly control gives it the resources it needs to fight spammers and maintain search result quality. Anyone who's paid attention recently knows that this is bullshit: Google search quality is in free-fall, across all its products: https://downloads.webis.de/publications/papers/bevendorff_2024a.pdf But Google doesn't seem to think it has a problem. Rather than devoting all its available resources to fighting botshit, spam and scams, the company set $80 billion dollars alight last year with a stock buyback that was swiftly followed with 12,000 layoffs, followed by multiple subsequent rounds of layoffs: https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/21/im-feeling-unlucky/#not-up-to-the-task The scams that slip through Google's cracks are sometimes nefarious, but just as often they're decidedly amateurish, the kind of thing that Google could fix by throwing money at the problem, say, to validate that new ads for confirmed Google merchants come from the merchant's registered email addresses and go to the merchant's registered website: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/24/passive-income/#swiss-cheese-security Search is a capital intensive business, and there are real returns to scale, as the UK Competition and Market Authority's excellent 2020 study describes: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5fe4957c8fa8f56aeff87c12/Appendix_I_-_search_quality_v.3_WEB_.pdf But Google doesn't seem to think that its search needs that $80 billion to fight the spamwars. That's the thing about monopolists, they get complacent. As Lily Tomlin's "Ernestine the AT&#38;T operator" used to say, "We don't care, we don't have to, we're the phone company." That's why I'm so excited about the DOJ Antitrust Division monopolization case against Google. Trusting one company to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," was a failure: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-google-monopolizing-digital-advertising-technologies I understand why people want to know which search engine they should use instead of Google, and I get why, "There aren't any good search engines" is such an unsatisfactory answer. I understand why each fresh round of printer-company fuckery prompts people to ask "which printer should I get?" and I understand why "There are only six major printer companies and they're all suffering from end-stage enshittification" isn't what anyone wants to hear. We want to be able to vote with our wallets, because it's so much faster and more convenient than voting with our ballots. But the vote-with-your-wallet election is rigged for the people with the thickest wallets. Try as hard as you'd like, you just can't shop your way out of a monopoly &#8211; that's like trying to recycle your way out of the climate emergency. Systemic problems need systemic solutions &#8211; not individual ones. That's why the new antitrust matters so much. The answer to monopolies is to break up companies, block and unwind mergers, ban deceptive and unfair conduct. "Caveat emptor" is the scammer's motto. You shouldn't have to be an expert on lead gen scams to hire a locksmith without getting ripped off. There are good products and services out there. Earlier this year, we decided to install a (non-networked) programmable pushbutton lock. I asked Deviant Ollam &#8211; whom I know from Defcon's Lockpicking Village &#8211; for a recommendation and he suggested the Schlage FE595: https://www.schlage.com/en/home/products/FE595PLYFFFFLA.html I liked it so much I bought another one for my office door. Eric from Golden State Lock and Safe installed it while I wrote this blog-post. It's great. I recommend both of 'em &#8211; 10/10, would do business again.

<p>I was sitting there, minding my own damn business, surfing the web, clicking around, enjoying my time, when I stumbled on <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/email-nightmare-just-give-up/677615/">this article</a>, by Ian Bogost on The Atlantic, that is so painfully stupid that I had to take the time and comment on it. Because, as you know, I love emails.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, in step five, you must evangelize your mission. Email is a public-health concern. Gently correct your mother when she tries to correspond. Reprimand your email-happy colleagues. Punish email abuse by withholding your replies. Or, more gently, darken someone’s doorway. In short, you must show the sort of leadership that will encourage others to forsake their email too. We’ll never stop the rain of email, no matter what we do. But if we work together, maybe we can build a kind of shelter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The entire premise of this article is that email is an unmanageable mess filled with all sorts of garbage and dealing with it is a lost cause. There’s an analogy in there that is so idiotic that is worth quoting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alas, there is no opting out from email. As a practical matter, your inbox cannot be abandoned altogether. The same is true for postal mail: To function within the normal bounds of contemporary society, you must be addressable in physical space. You must be able to receive Amex bills and Amazon baubles, and also, you must subject yourself to lots of junk. This analogy between your home’s mailbox and your computer’s inbox is so easily made that it’s often overlooked. Both are stuffed with garbage by default, but also just a few essential messages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ian, let me give you some shocking advice: unlike your physical address, it’s not hard to get an extra email address. Hell, you can get even more than one. You can go one step further and get a disposable one! Shocking, I know!</p>
<p>In all seriousness, if in 2024 you’re using one single email address for everything that’s a you problem, not an email problem. Also, Ian, let me ask you a question: what’s the alternative here? Do we all move to Slack/Discord/Teams? Do we all move everything to DMs? Do you think that’s a better solution?</p>
<p>There’s a reason why emails are still here. They’re still here because they work. Is email perfect? No. Is there a better alternative? Also no.</p>

## Amazon Just Bought a Nuclear-Powered Data Center

date: 2024-03-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p><em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> A tumbleweed invasion nearly buried some houses in Utah • Storms triggered floods, avalanches, and tornadoes across Italy • California’s snowpack is above normal levels for the first time this year.</em></p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Amazon Web Services buys nuclear-powered data center </h3><p><strong></strong>Amazon’s cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services, just <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=906b19da89&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">paid</a> $650 million for a data center that runs on nuclear power. Talen Energy’s Cumulus data center campus in Pennsylvania gets power from the Susquehanna nuclear plant, one of the largest nuclear power plants in the U.S. It will give Amazon a supply of clean carbon-free power, which the company could use to run energy-intensive artificial intelligence operations. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e6d3a8bdc1&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a> that AI searches require 10 times more computing power than regular searches. Amazon’s new data center campus could give it a leg-up over other tech giants because “companies looking to start data centers running AI face delays in getting permits to connect to grids, and long waits for the installation of transmission lines to connect utilities to their facilities.”</p><h3><span></span>2. E-bike accidents account for majority of NYC cycling deaths </h3><p><strong></strong>Thirty cyclists died in New York City last year, the highest number since 1999, <em>The New York Times</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e471cdcc85&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">reported</a>, citing Department of Transportation data. Twenty-three of those killed were riding electric bikes, and most of them collided with vehicles in areas lacking proper cycling infrastructure. However the <em>Times</em> notes that a good portion (about one-third) of the e-bike riders who died were in solo crashes – accidents that did not involve cars or pedestrians, a trend that isn’t seen among traditional bike-riders. “There may be a learning curve that some first-time e-bike riders aren’t prepared for,” said Sara Lind, an executive director at Open Plans. “It’s very possible that that learning curve, combined with the speed of the bike, exacerbates already confusing or chaotic conditions. Navigating a pothole or a suddenly blocked bike lane is more dangerous at a higher speed, emphasizing even more the need for better infrastructure as more people use e-bikes.” Some e-bikes can reach speeds of 25 mph, though NYC is reducing the top speeds of electric Citi Bikes to 18 mph.</p><h3>3. NOAA warns of mass coral bleaching event </h3><p><strong></strong>The world is on the cusp of the worst mass coral bleaching event in the history of the planet, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=89b328527f&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">warned</a>. Climate change and El Niño have sent ocean temperatures soaring, and already “the Southern Hemisphere is basically bleaching all over the place,” ecologist Derek Manzello, the coordinator of NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch, told <em>Reuters</em>. “The entirety of the Great Barrier Reef is bleaching. We just had reports that American Samoa is bleaching.” Researchers believe a sustained global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius is a tipping point for mass coral reef die-off. Coral reef ecosystems provide a home to thousands of species of fish and other plants and animals, and are essential sources of food and income for millions of people around the world. NOAA <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6d30066377&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">notes</a> that “when a coral bleaches, it is not dead. Corals can survive a bleaching event, but they are under more stress and are subject to mortality.”</p><h3>4. Goldman Sachs predicts battery prices will soon plummet</h3><p><strong></strong>In case you missed it, Goldman Sachs is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=30b244545d&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">forecasting</a> that electric vehicle battery prices will fall dramatically in the coming months thanks to an increased supply of minerals like nickel and lithium, plus innovations in manufacturing. In a research <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=88bc08ac10&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">note</a>, the firm said it expects battery prices to drop by 40% between 2023 and 2025, resulting in “breakthrough levels” of cost parity with internal combustion engine cars in some markets. By 2030, Goldman sees EVs accounting for 50% of U.S. car sales. Looking ahead, Nikhil Bhandari, co-head of Asia-Pacific Natural Resources and Clean Energy Research, said major innovations like solid-state batteries could “be a game-changer for the industry.” Batteries can account for one-third of the cost of an EV.</p><h3>5. Man charged with smuggling greenhouse gases into U.S.</h3><p><strong></strong>Here’s a weird one: A California man has been charged with smuggling greenhouse gases into the U.S., <em>Axios</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=469a7be75c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Michael Hart allegedly bought hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in Mexico, hid them in his vehicle, and brought them into the States where he listed them for sale. HFCs are greenhouse gases used in refrigeration. The United Nations’ Climate and Clean Air Coalition <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=ff9bad857b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> HFCs represent around 2% of total greenhouse gases, but “their impact on global warming can be hundreds to thousands of times greater than that of carbon dioxide (CO2) per unit of mass.” The EPA is <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0d03152095&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">trying</a> to implement a phase-down of HFCs, and said smuggling them "undermines international efforts to combat climate change.”</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>Just three of this year’s Oscar-nominated films (<em>Barbie</em>, <em>Nyad</em>, and <em>Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One</em>) pass the <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1143de2e5b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“Climate Reality Check,”</a> a two-part test that asks if climate change exists in a film’s story, and if at least one character knows about it.</p>

Not some fancy media critic opinion or an editorial. A real report, taking defensiveness out of it and applying accountability." A regular reader of this blog will know how totally I agree with this. But oddly when I agreed with her, perhaps a little to strongly for her liking, she accused me of being a MAGA. It's so totally not true, and typical of reporters, to use an ad hominem to not have to listen to a non-journalist opinion about journalism.

## 2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine

date: 2024-03-05, from: Alex Schroeder's Blog

<h1>2024-03-04 Israel and Palestine</h1>

<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering how Israel is going to come back after all this, I suspect you already forgot how it managed to come back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Gaza%E2%80%93Israel_conflict">after 2006</a>. I&rsquo;m not sure how that makes me feel. On the one hand, I have completely checked out. The people in charge are utter villains. The settlements, the cutting down of trees, the terrorizing, the things one reads in the news if one cares to look are in a vague but emotionally crushing and morally grinding way similar to how the territory of the US was built on rape, murder, land grab, death marches and reservations. On the other hand, I think we cannot let that hold us back from seeking a better future. We must not stare at the bloody entrails left behind on this road to war. Yes, the news is grim. We must look past it, however. What comes after that? Where will we be in forty years? In twenty years? In five years? In two years? Next year? How will it be better than this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The disparity in conditions in the north and south is clear evidence that aid restrictions in the north are costing lives. UNICEF and WFP malnutrition screenings in the north in January found that nearly 16 per cent - or 1 in 6 children under 2 years of age - are acutely malnourished. Similar screenings conducted in the south in Rafah, where aid has been more available, found 5 per cent of children under 2 years are acutely malnourished.” – <a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/statement-adele-khodr-unicef-regional-director-middle-east-and-north-africa-0">Statement by Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you think a solution is impossible, then take heart. The world has managed to come back from two World Wars and countless other brutal wars. Peace is possible. People are not inherently evil. Most people want peace. Those in power and the people surrounding them and supporting them often don&rsquo;t want peace, however. And once the slaughter starts, it&rsquo;s hard to stop. Peace is hard.</p>

<p>Often the people arguing for war just can&rsquo;t imagine peace because of this detail or that detail. And the details are hard to get right, for sure. But they are not impossible. Imagination is required. How else are people going to make plans for after the war? The war will end one day. And those who survived will be following plans that somebody imagined. It is important to imagine a happy, prosperous future and then to make plans of how to get there.</p>

<p>I remember how I was a German speaking kid in Portugal in the eighties and sometimes I&rsquo;d be greeted by an angry &ldquo;Heil Hitler!&rdquo; from kids my age. And Portugal wasn&rsquo;t even in the war! But all the killing takes generations to forgive and forget. The longer it takes us to get to peace, the longer it will take to forgive. And once there is peace, we must not squander it. We need to work for it. We need to keep aiming for that happy, prosperous future and stick to plans that go there. Don&rsquo;t follow leaders without a clear plan. If they don&rsquo;t have one, they don&rsquo;t care or they&rsquo;re unwilling to listen. There are many people with plans for peace. It&rsquo;s just that the road is hard. And yet, that is the road we have.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stop the killing.</li>
<li>Respect human rights.</li>
<li>Implement justice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s hard. But the alternative isn&rsquo;t looking good. And we know how to do this. We have negotiated countless peace treaties. We have found solutions to thorny issues all over the world. This is not an impossible task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We laugh so we don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; I heard Sarah Taber say in her Farm to Taber podcast, either in <a href="https://shows.acast.com/farm-to-taber/episodes/the-true-story-of-us-agriculture">Season 4, Ep. 7: The History of US Agriculture: How Jim Crow paid off for the Midwestern family farm</a> or in <a href="https://shows.acast.com/farm-to-taber/episodes/king-cotton-jim-crow-and-pellagra">Season 4, Ep. 9: King Cotton, Jim Crow, and Pellagra</a>.</p>

<p>In that spirit, <a href="https://existentialcomics.com/comic/527">Existential Comics 527: Fantasy Morality</a> has this note at the end:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the good guys always win in the end, and are typically outnumbered, this becomes pretty important. The orcs will brutally, savagely kill a few dozen elves, and the elves will respond in a very civilized fashion by wiping out the entire orc civilization. You can even still see this kind of justification in contemporary colonialism (<em>cough Israel cough</em>).</p>

## Joni Mitchell proves why we should look beyond stereotypes about aging

date: 2024-03-05, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Whether or not we&#8217;re older adults, we all are being bombarded with a blunt political narrative about aging that is as wrong as it is dangerous. In essence, the message is that &#8220;old&#8221; equals &#8220;bad&#8221; and that if a person is going to be a leader, they had better do it while they are young.

				<p>In dueling visits to the Texas-Mexico border, President Joe Biden and Donald Trump each tried to make the case that they&#8217;re the person best positioned to handle immigration amid polls showing voters trust the latter more despite his chaotic and sadistic tenure presiding over the nation&#8217;s enforcement infrastructure.</p>

## Nvidia becomes Tesla’s successor as market flips from EV to AI

date: 2024-03-05, from: Hawaii Tribune Harold


				<p>Nvidia Corp.&#8217;s rise is captivating the stock market and driving the S&#038;P 500 Index to new highs. But it also raises cautionary reminders of another investor darling that soared on dreams of a technological transformation, only to tumble back to earth when those hopes turned to disappointment. That stock belongs to Tesla Inc., which sparked its own mania in 2017 as investors bet that electric vehicles were going to take over the world. Back then, Elon Musk&#8217;s company was a phenomenon as it blew past established carmakers like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. in market capitalization to become America&#8217;s biggest auto manufacturer. Some analysts were looking beyond the industry and calling it &#8220;the next Apple Inc.&#8221;</p>

## Republican Voters Clash Over Whether Haley Should Remain in Nomination Race

date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA

NEW ORLEANS — As the Republican Party primary contests continue into their third month, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is the only remaining challenger to former U.S. President Donald Trump. 


The primaries will determine who is the GOP’s nominee for president and who will challenge President Joe Biden in November’s presidential election.

 

Trump has won all but one of the 11 primaries and caucuses so far, racking up 276 total delegates to Haley’s 43. (Haley earned her first victory in Washington D.C. this past weekend, a contest long predicted to go her way.) With 15 states casting their votes for a nominee on March 5, a day known as “Super Tuesday,” Republicans are divided on whether Haley should remain in the race or get out of the former president’s way.  

 

“If you’re a Democrat, you probably want Haley to stay in the race because she’s distracting Trump from focusing on defeating Biden,” explained Bob Carreto, a Trump supporter from Chalmette, Louisiana. “But if you’re a real Republican, you want her to drop out of the primaries as fast as possible.”




“She’s forcing Trump to spend money defeating her, and it’s not good for the Republican Party,” Carreto said. “But the reality is, she doesn’t stand a chance, so she should just quit.”


Even though Trump has won each of the contests so far, not all voters who could cast their ballot this November for a Republican think Haley should exit.


“I think she’s incredibly brave for staying in the race, especially given that Trump is a maniacal egoist who attacks anyone who challenges him,” Abby LaCombe, an independent voter from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, told VOA. 


“She’s facing a lot of attacks for refusing to withdraw, and she’s giving people who vote Republican a choice — the ability to choose someone other than Trump, a politician who has shown he has no respect whatsoever for democracy,” LaCombe said.


The Haley campaign did not respond to VOA's request for comment when asked what Haley would say to those questioning why she is staying in the race.


Uphill battle


The Trump campaign has been insistent on undercutting Haley’s challenge by 

highlighting her many stumbles at the ballot box. In her home state of South Carolina, for example, the former president collected 60% of the vote to her 40%.


Michigan is a more moderate state where independent voters — thought to be more receptive to Haley’s message — are allowed to vote in the Republican primary. Still, in the state’s recent primary, Trump’s margin of victory was even greater (68% to 27%).


“She can’t name one state she can win, let alone be competitive in,” Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said in a statement last week.


The Haley campaign did not respond to VOA's request for comment when asked where she believes she can win on Super Tuesday or beyond.


On Sunday’s “Meet the Press” talk show, Haley said, "I think we fight. You're going to have 16 states and territories that are voting on Tuesday. And so, a lot of people's voices are going to be heard. And that's what this has all been about.”




Most political experts, like University of Georgia political scientist Charles Bullock, agree that it will be difficult for Haley to win against the former president.


“I think it’s probably too late for her,” he explained to VOA. “This is Trump’s party, and he controls its voters. It’s a party dominated by an electorate who will stick with him no matter what — probably until he dies or withdraws from public view.”


Bullock, however, sees one way the Republican faithful could abandon him.


“A conviction,” he said. “Polling shows that if he is convicted of one of the several crimes he is accused of, then a substantial number of voters would abandon him. I think it’s possible that Haley is waiting, hopeful she could gather his votes if a conviction takes place.”


Trump faces 91 charges in four trials, including allegations he illegally tried to upend his 2020 election loss, whether he illegally took highly classified documents with him when he left office, and whether he falsified documents related to hush-money paid to a porn actor.


He has denied all the allegations.


Motivation for remaining in the race


A Reuters/Ipsos poll from last month found that 51% of Republican voters said they would not vote for Trump if he was convicted of any of the 91 felony charges brought against him across four criminal trials. A further 25% said they weren’t sure how they would vote in that case.


Fifty-eight percent said they would not vote for Trump if he were serving time in prison in November.


While experts like Bullock believe a Trump conviction might be Haley’s reason for staying in the race, others say she could have other motivations.


Henry Olsen, a senior fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, believes Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, hopes if she can win several states, it will allow her to gain concessions from Trump during the Republican National Convention.


“She’s been spending her time in more moderate states and states where independent voters are also allowed to take part in the Republican primary,” Olsen said, adding, “states like Minnesota, where Marco Rubio beat Trump in the 2016 primary, and Colorado, where moderate Republican Senator Joe O’Dea beat a Trump-supported opponent by a wide margin.”




“Utah, Vermont, Massachusetts and Maine are all in the same boat, and if she can win five states, Republican Party rules will give her more time and clout at the convention to voice her opposition to Trump,” Olsen continued. “Those wins are going to be a stretch for her, but if she gets them, Trump’s team will want to avoid any bad attention at the convention and may be willing to give concessions important to her, like a promise to support NATO.”


Other experts, like David Stack, a political scientist at Cleveland State University, thinks Haley might have one eye set on the 2028 presidential election.


“I just don’t see Haley having a path to the nomination this cycle,” Stack told VOA. “Her best bet for a win on Super Tuesday might be in Vermont, but even there she is down by about 30% in polling.”


“So, the question then is why is she staying in the race?” Stack said. “I think it could be to bolster her name recognition and collect donations for future elections. If she has a good amount of money in the bank after Super Tuesday, that could be a sign she is building a war chest for the future.”


Alternative to Trump


For her part, Haley insists her focus is on the present and that she believes she is the Republican Party’s best chance at unseating President Biden.


“This has never been about me or my political future,” Haley said last week after her defeat in the South Carolina primaries. “We need to beat Joe Biden in November. I don’t believe Donald Trump can beat Joe Biden. Nearly every day, Trump drives people away.”


She added, “I’m an accountant. I know 40% is not 50%, but I also know 40% is not some tiny group. There are huge numbers in our Republican primaries who are saying they want an alternative.”


Jason Winder, a Republican from Uintah County, Utah, says he is one of those voters and is looking forward to casting his ballot for Haley on Tuesday.


“I like the idea of having a choice, and I’m grateful to still be able to show my dissent for Trump by backing someone who wasn’t involved in the January 6 insurrection,” Winder told VOA. “I hope the GOP leadership wakes up. He lost the popular vote in 2016 and 2020, and I think the margins will be even bigger this year. At least Nikki Haley gives us a chance.”


This week, Haley told supporters at a rally in Minnesota that Trump can’t win the general election if he’s losing 40% of the vote, and polling has shown a sizable portion of the Republican Party believe Trump is too extreme to defeat Biden. Nearly nine in 10 Haley voters in South Carolina said they would not be satisfied with Trump as the Republican Party’s presidential nominee.


As a result, support in the form of fundraising dollars and endorsements from moderate segments of the Republican Party continue to find their way to the former governor.


On Friday, Haley received endorsements from two of the party’s most moderate senators, Susan Collins from Maine and Lisa Murkowski from Alaska.


Despite that support, many in the party, including Trump’s most ardent supporters, continue to push Haley to exit the race.


“I actually like Nikki Haley and I would vote for her if she was the nominee,” explained Harvey Wasserman, a resident of Daytona Beach, Florida. “But I’ve voted for Trump twice and I’m going to do it again in the primary. I don’t think she can win, so it’s time for her to give the stage to Trump so he can focus on Biden.”

## Donald Trump Wins North Dakota Republican Caucuses

date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA

BISMARCK, N.D. — Donald Trump won the North Dakota Republican presidential caucuses on Monday, adding to his string of victories heading into Super Tuesday.


The former president finished first in voting conducted at 12 caucus sites, ahead of former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. The result puts Trump back on the winning track, which was briefly interrupted on Sunday when Haley notched her first victory of the campaign in the District of Columbia's primary.


The White House hopefuls now turn their attention to Super Tuesday, when results will pour in from 16 states in contests that amount to the single biggest delegate haul of any day in the presidential primary. Trump and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, are dominating their races and are on track to winning their nominations later this month.


Under North Dakota's rules, candidates are eligible to win delegates if they finish with at least 20% of the vote. However, a candidate who wins at least 60% of the vote receives all of the state's 29 delegates.


Four candidates were on the ballot, including Trump and Nikki Haley. The other candidates, who have received little attention, were Florida businessman David Stuckenberg and Texas businessman and pastor Ryan Binkley, who recently ended his campaign.


Retired music teacher and librarian Karen Groninger, of Almont, said Monday that she voted for Trump, calling him the best choice. The 76-year-old cited Trump's 2020 speech at the annual March for Life anti-abortion event in Washington, D.C. — the first by a sitting president — and his border policies.


Longtime Republican state Sen. Dick Dever, of Bismarck, said he voted for Haley, but added she's unlikely to win. The retired factory representative, 72, said, "I hear an awful lot of people say that they really liked Trump's policies, but they don't like the way he conducts himself, and I think he's gone overboard a bit."


Caucus voters were encouraged to be paying party members, but those who wouldn't pay $50 for annual membership were asked to sign a pledge to affiliate with the party, caucus Chair Robert Harms said.


North Dakota is the only state without voter registration. The caucuses followed official state voter identification protocols, such as providing a driver's license. Voting was done only in person and on printed ballots, which will be hand-counted.


In 2016, it was a North Dakota delegate who helped Trump secure the number needed for the Republican presidential nomination.


He swept North Dakota's three electoral college votes in 2016 and 2020, winning about 63% and 65% of those votes, respectively.


As president, Trump visited Bismarck and Mandan in 2017 to talk about tax cuts, and he campaigned twice in Fargo in 2018 for Kevin Cramer in the then-congressman's successful Senate bid against Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp.


North Dakota's Democratic-NPL Party is holding a presidential primary almost entirely by mail, with mail-in voting from Feb. 20 to March 30, and limited in-person voting for residents of Indian reservations. President Joe Biden, Rep. Dean Phillips and six others are on the ballot.


A third party will count ballots in Fargo on March 30, with results available on the party's website afterward.


Sen. Bernie Sanders won the Democratic caucuses in 2016 and 2020.

## White House Raises Hopes for Gaza 6-Week Cease-Fire Deal

date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA

Vice President Kamala Harris reiterated Monday support for an “immediate” six-week cease-fire in Gaza, meeting with a top member of Israel’s war Cabinet as the conflict teeters on the five-month mark. But analysts and protesters note that stopping the conflict hinges on negotiations the Biden administration won’t discuss, and that may not yield a deal before the White House’s stated deadline – the start of Ramadan. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.

## US: Low Iran Election Turnout Another Sign of 'Discontent'

date: 2024-03-05, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States said Monday that the low turnout in Iran's election came as no surprise and was a new sign of discontent in the cleric-run state.


"I don't think there's any doubt that there's discontent about the regime's rule," State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters.


"We did not assess that these elections would be free and fair, and I believe that many Iranian voters would assess that the elections would not be free and fair, and so it wouldn't surprise me if in that regard they chose not to participate," he said.


Election authorities said Monday that conservatives and ultra-conservatives secured a large majority in parliamentary elections — in which many hopefuls including moderates and reformists were disqualified from running.


Authorities said turnout was 41%, the lowest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution toppled the pro-Western shah.

## Rust for embedded systems: current state, challenges and open problems

date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News

Embedded software is used in safety-critical systems such as medical devices and autonomous vehicles, where software defects, including security vulnerabilities, have severe consequences. Most embedded codebases are developed in unsafe languages, specifically C/C++, and are riddled with memory safety vulnerabilities. To prevent such vulnerabilities, RUST, a performant memory-safe systems language, provides an optimal choice for developing embedded software. RUST interoperability enables developing RUST applications on top of existing C codebases. Despite this, even the most resourceful organizations continue to develop embedded software in C/C++. This paper performs the first systematic study to holistically understand the current state and challenges of using RUST for embedded systems. Our study is organized across three research questions. We collected a dataset of 2,836 RUST embedded software spanning various categories and 5 Static Application Security Testing ( SAST) tools. We performed a systematic analysis of our dataset and surveys with 225 developers to investigate our research questions. We found that existing RUST software support is inadequate, SAST tools cannot handle certain features of RUST embedded software, resulting in failures, and the prevalence of advanced types in existing RUST software makes it challenging to engineer interoperable code. In addition, we found various challenges faced by developers in using RUST for embedded systems development. ↫ Ayushi Sharma, Shashank Sharma, Santiago Torres-Arias, Aravind Machiry Some light reading.

## US Lobbyists Drop Chinese Clients Amid Tightened Scrutiny

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

washington  — Lobbying firms in Washington are reportedly rushing to drop clients from China as lawmakers look to tighten scrutiny. The push comes in the wake of a surge in Chinese lobbying in recent years and growing concerns about China’s influence.


U.S. lawmakers say they are promoting legislation that would provide more transparency into who is lobbying for Chinese companies. The legislators aim to prevent the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People's Liberation Army (PLA) from using gray areas to secretly advance policy agendas that harm the interests of the American people.


Republican Senator John Cornyn told VOA’s Mandarin Service last week that lawmakers are very close to completing work on legislation that aims to address the problem. Last year, lawmakers in the Senate passed the disclosing Foreign Influence in Lobbying Act and members of the House have introduced a similar bill. Cornyn was a co-sponsor of the Senate bill.




“We’ve encountered some dissent but will continue to work because it’s important to understand who is actually lobbying these policymakers,” Cornyn said. "The primary focus has been on making sure people register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. As you know, there's been a lot of problems associated with people not disclosing their lobby contracts with foreign countries.”


Closing loopholes


In pushing legislation, lawmakers are looking to close existing loopholes in the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 (FARA) and the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA) to demand more transparency regarding foreign governments and political parties that participate in the planning, supervision, direction or control of lobbying efforts regardless of whether they have made any financial contributions or not.


China is a unique challenge, Cornyn noted.


“The Chinese are unique in that there is no true solely private sector; they are forced to share information with the PLA and with their intelligence agencies,” he said. “So, I would say anytime we're dealing with the Chinese-owned enterprise, it's a cause for concern.”


U.S. lobbying is regulated by the LDA, which requires disclosure of domestic lobbying, and FARA, which requires disclosure of lobbying and other forms of influence by foreign governments and political parties. However, in 1995, FARA was amended to exempt those who represent foreign companies or individuals if the work is not intended to benefit a foreign government or political party. As a result, lobbyists registered under the far less transparent LDA and the result was a dramatic drop in FARA registrations.


Clients dropped


The effort to tighten scrutiny of China’s lobbying activities follows the U.S. Department of Defense’s release in late January of a list of "Chinese military companies" operating directly or indirectly in the United States known as the 1260H list.


Lawmakers subsequently said they were considering a measure prohibiting lobbyists who represent companies on the list from meeting with members of Congress, even to discuss matters on behalf of their American clients.


Following the release of the 1260H list, a chart began circulating on Capitol Hill that named various Chinese companies, including some military firms, as well as the names of their lobbying firms and whether they appear on the 1260H list.


Responding to the chart, at least five U.S. lobbying firms dropped Chinese clients as of late February. Steptoe LLP has terminated its contract with Shenzhen biotech company BGI. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld filed cease-and-desist documents to stop lobbying for Chinese LiDAR maker Hesai Group and terminated its cooperation with Xiaomi, a Chinese electronics company not on the 1260H list. The Vogel Group has also dropped lobbying services for Chinese drone company DJI and Complete Genomics, a subsidiary of genetic technology company BGI.


DJI and Hesai are both on the 1260H list. Complete Genomics is not on the list, but its previous parent company, BGI, is on it.


Boycotting meetings


Republican Senator Marco Rubio told VOA that while it is difficult to pass a law prohibiting members of Congress from meeting with anyone, some congressional offices have decided not to meet with lobbying firms representing Chinese military companies.




"There are just certain entities we won't meet with because we understand that while they may be doing it for commercial reasons, the interests that they're representing are linked to Chinese goals, military goals and aspirations,” he said. “And so … we've made that decision unilaterally.”


Robert Sutter, professor of practice of international affairs at the Elliott School of George Washington University, said historically, Chinese military entities' lobbying activities have been an ambiguous area, and the enforcement has been weak.


"These [companies] lobbying for these firms ... it's probably legal in some way. But there is a reputational cost, and I think that's what the Congresspeople are calling attention to in saying they will boycott these firms," he said.


According to Open Secrets, a political money website, China’s lobbying has surged in recent years. China spent more than $330 million on lobbying between 2019 and 2023. That stands in sharp contrast to the $60 million it spent between 2015 and 2018.


China’s lobbying roster


Craig Singleton, a senior researcher with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, notes up until a few years ago, Chinese corporate lobbying in Washington was almost non-existent but that changed when the U.S. government went after Huawei.


After that, “Chinese firms switched gears and quickly scaled up, deploying lobbyists to protect their bottom lines in the face of increasing scrutiny from Democrats and Republicans alike," he said. "Today, China's lobbying roster reads like a 'who's who' of Washington insiders, from retired Pentagon brass to former high-ranking congressional aides. The goal of these lobbying operations is simple: disrupting any actions that could negatively impact their clients' market share, deflecting regulatory scrutiny and defending against sanctions."


Singleton said the Department of Justice – which is responsible for administering and enforcing FARA – could play a bigger role in curbing the CCP's malign lobbying influence on Capitol Hill.


"The U.S. Department of Justice currently mandates only two Chinese companies, Huawei and Hikvision, to disclose their lobbying activities under FARA, offering a comprehensive overview of their engagements,” he said. “Despite additional Chinese firms being flagged as national security risks by the Defense Department and FCC, the Justice Department has not extended FARA filing requirements to these problematic entities. The only apparent obstacle to such action is a lack of political will within the Justice Department itself."


VOA Mandarin reached out to the Department of Justice, but it declined to comment.

## An Apple district manager’s Macintosh Portable in 1989-91 (featuring GEIS AppleLink and a look at System 7.0 alpha)

date: 2024-03-04, from: OS News

A few months ago I introduced you to one of the more notable Apple pre-production units in my collection, a late prototype Macintosh Portable. But it turns out it&#8217;s not merely notable for what it is than what it has on it: a beta version of System 6.0.6 (the doomed release that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales databases, two online services — the maligned Mac Prodigy client, along with classic AppleLink as used by Apple staff — and two presentations, one on Apple&#8217;s current Macintosh line and one on the upcoming System 7. Now that I&#8217;ve got the infamous Conner hard drive it came with safely copied over, it&#8217;s time to explore its contents some more. ↫ Old Vintage Computing Research I wonder just how rare it is to find old internal presentations from a company like Apple. It seems like something that doesn&#8217;t happen very often, so it&#8217;s great to see this archived and documented.

## US National Guard Member Jack Teixeira Pleads Guilty to Leaking Military Secrets

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

Boston — Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira pleaded guilty on Monday in federal court to leaking highly classified military documents about Russia's war in Ukraine and other national security secrets.


Teixeira pleaded guilty to six counts of willful retention and transmission of national defense information under the Espionage Act nearly a year after he was arrested in the most consequential national security leak in years.


The stunning breach raised alarm over America's ability to protect its most closely guarded secrets and forced the Biden administration to scramble to try to contain diplomatic and military fallout. The leaks embarrassed the Pentagon, which tightened controls to safeguard classified information and disciplined members found to have intentionally failed to take required action about Teixeira's suspicious behavior.


Teixeira, 22, admitted illegally collecting military secrets and sharing them with other users on Discord, a social media platform popular with people playing online games. Prosecutors plan to seek nearly 17 years in prison for him, according to the plea agreement.


Teixeira, who was part of the 102nd Intelligence Wing at Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts, worked as a cyber transport systems specialist, essentially an information technology specialist responsible for military communications networks.


Authorities said he first typed out classified documents he accessed and then began sharing photographs of files that bore SECRET and TOP SECRET markings. The leak exposed to the world unvarnished secret assessments of Russia's war in Ukraine, the capabilities and geopolitical interests of other nations and other national security issues.


Teixeira remains in the Air National Guard in an unpaid status, an Air Force official said.

Teixeira has been behind bars since his April arrest. The judge denied his request for release from jail last year after prosecutors revealed he had a history of violent rhetoric and warned that U.S. adversaries who might be interested in mining Teixeira for information could facilitate his escape.


Prosecutors have said little about a motive. But members of the Discord group described Teixeira as someone looking to show off, rather than being motivated by a desire to inform the public about U.S. military operations or to influence American policy.


Prosecutors have said Teixeira continued to leak government secrets even after he was warned by superiors about mishandling and improper viewing of classified information. In one instance, Teixeira was seen taking notes on intelligence information and putting them in his pocket.


The Air Force inspector general found that members "intentionally failed to report the full details" of Teixeira's unauthorized intelligence-seeking because they thought security officials might overreact. For example, while Teixeira was confronted about the notes, there was no follow-up to ensure the notes had been shredded and the incident was not reported to security officers.


It was not until a January 2023 incident that the appropriate security officials were notified, but even then security officials were not briefed on the full scope of the violations.

## Former Trump CFO Pleads Guilty to Perjury in Ex-President's Civil Fraud Case

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Allen Weisselberg, the former chief financial officer of Donald Trump's company, pleaded guilty Monday in New York to perjury in connection with testimony he gave in the ex-president's civil fraud case. 


Weisselberg, 76, pleaded guilty to two counts of perjury and will be sentenced to five months in jail — which would be his second stint behind bars after 100 days last year in an unrelated tax fraud case. 


The pleas related to testimony he gave at a July 2020 deposition in New York Attorney General Letitia James' case against Trump, but in court Monday he also admitted, without pleading guilty, to lying on the witness stand at the former president's civil fraud trial last fall. 


Prosecutors accused Weisselberg of lying under oath in the case about allegations that Trump lied about his wealth on financial statements given to banks and insurance companies. 


"Allen Weisselberg looks forward to putting this situation behind him," his lawyer Seth Rosenberg said in a statement. 


After The New York Times reported last month that Weisselberg was in negotiations to plead guilty to perjury, Judge Arthur Engoron, who presided over the fraud trial, ordered attorneys to provide details related to the Times' report. 


Trump is appealing Engoron's judgment ordering him to pay more than $454 million in fines and interest for submitting fraudulent information about his asset values on years of financial records. 


Weisselberg's new criminal case comes just weeks before Trump is scheduled to stand trial on separate allegations that he falsified business records. That case involves allegations that Trump falsified company records to cover up hush money payments made during the 2016 campaign to bury allegations that he had extramarital sexual encounters. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing. 


Former Trump lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen has said Weisselberg had a role in orchestrating the payments, but he has not been charged in that case, and neither prosecutors nor Trump's lawyers have indicated they will call him as a witness. That trial is scheduled to begin March 25. 


Weisselberg's case is separate from the criminal case that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought against Trump last year. 


Weisselberg previously served 100 days in jail last year after pleading guilty to dodging taxes on $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation from the Trump Organization. He is still on probation. Prior to that he had no criminal record. 


He left New York City's notorious Rikers Island in April, days after Trump was indicted in his New York hush money criminal case. 


Under that plea deal, Weisselberg was required to testify as a prosecution witness when the Trump Organization was put on trial for helping executives evade taxes. He did so carefully, laying out the facts of his own involvement in evading taxes but taking care not to implicate Trump, telling jurors that his boss was unaware of the scheme

## US Slaps Sanctions on Zimbabwe Leadership, Citing Abuses

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa and other senior leaders, denouncing what it said was a campaign of rights abuses and corruption. 


The sanctions, which will block any U.S.-based property and block any unofficial travel to the United States, replace a broader, two-decade-old sanctions program against Zimbabwe. 


"The changes we are making today are intended to make clear what has always been true: our sanctions are not intended to target the people of Zimbabwe," Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said. 


"We are refocusing our sanctions on clear and specific targets: President Mnangagwa's criminal network of government officials and businesspeople who are most responsible for corruption or human rights abuse against the people of Zimbabwe," he said. 


Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the new measures were part of a "stronger, more targeted sanctions policy" on Zimbabwe as he voiced concern over "serious cases of corruption and human rights abuse." 


"Key individuals, including members of the government of Zimbabwe, bear responsibility for these actions, including the looting of government coffers that robs Zimbabweans of public resources," Blinken said in a statement. 


"Multiple cases of abductions, physical abuse, and unlawful killing have left citizens living in fear." 


Mnangagwa, whose party has been in power for more than four decades, was declared the winner of a new term in an election in August that international observers said fell short of democratic standards. 


He is the second consecutive Zimbabwean leader to face U.S. sanctions following veteran president Robert Mugabe. 


Hopes of a thaw briefly surfaced after Mnangagwa pushed Mugabe out of power in 2017, but Western powers and rights groups say that the new leadership has also clamped down on the opposition and protests.


President Joe Biden in a declaration on Monday ended an earlier sanctions program on Zimbabwe imposed in 2003 under George W. Bush, who had advocated for a broader global push of sanctions on the country under Mugabe.

## IndieWeb Carnival: Accessibility in the Small Web

date: 2024-03-04, from: Manu - I write blog

<p>This is my entry for <a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com/accessibility-in-the-personal-web/">this month’s IndieWeb Carnival</a> hosted by <a href="https://blog.basementcommunity.com">Orchids</a> on the topic of Accessibility in the Small Web</p>
<hr />
<p>I started making websites back in 2010. That’s 14 years. I entered the web dev world back when the frontend scene was starting to become exciting thanks to CSS3 and HTML5. Shadows, rounded corners, custom typefaces! Everything was exciting. Also, new tags! I remember spending time reading about <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, and all the new things at my disposal. But I never thought about spending time learning about what all this meant in terms of accessibility.</p>
<p>I worked solo my entire career. I still do. I have to wear a thousand different hats on a daily basis and keeping up with the web as a whole is a full-time job. And it’s only recently that I started to realize how much I neglected accessibility when it comes to my sites.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I still try to follow at least some best practices: I try to pick combinations of colors that have enough contrast, and I try to structure my documents in a way that makes sense for screen readers but I’m painfully aware how much my knowledge on the topic is lacking.</p>
<p>These days I find myself hating on the “modern web”. I can’t stand sites that don’t load if I block some JS. I can’t stand sits that highjack my scroll. I hate that everything is getting more and more performative and less functional.</p>
<p>And in my retreat towards a simpler and more streamlined web, I’m rediscovering the pleasure of making sites that are simple and more accessible.</p>
<p>Accessibility becomes easier when sites are simpler. Still, I think I can and should do better which is why I have my eyes set on <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com">Sara Soueidan</a>’s <a href="https://practical-accessibility.today">Practical Accessibility</a> course (only waiting to have 400$ to invest).</p>
<p>It’s a shame that so much of the web has become an unusable mess. At the same time though, it’s refreshing to see that a good chunk of the small web seems to be heading in the right direction: simpler websites, less complicated and more focused layouts.</p>

## Sinead O'Connor's Estate Tells Trump: ‘Stop Playing Her Music at Rallies’

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

LONDON — The estate of Sinead O’Connor asked Donald Trump Monday not to play her music at campaign rallies, saying the late singer considered the former president a “biblical devil.”


Trump has played O’Connor’s biggest hit, “Nothing Compares 2 U,” at events as he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination.


In a joint statement, O’Connor’s estate and her record label, Chrysalis, demanded Trump “desist from using her music immediately.”


It said the Irish singer, who died last year aged 56, “lived by a fierce moral code defined by honesty, kindness, fairness and decency towards her fellow human beings.”


“It was with outrage therefore that we learned that Donald Trump has been using her iconic performance of Nothing Compares 2 U at his political rallies,” the statement said.




“It is no exaggeration to say that Sinead would have been disgusted, hurt and insulted to have her work misrepresented in this way by someone who she herself referred to as a ‘biblical devil.’ As the guardians of her legacy, we demand that Donald Trump and his associates desist from using her music immediately.”


Fiery and outspoken, O’Connor was a critic of the Roman Catholic Church well before  


allegations of sexual abuse were widely reported, and she was open about her mental health struggles.


She was found unresponsive at her London home in July and pronounced dead at the scene. A coroner ruled that she died of natural causes.


O’Connor joins a growing list of artists who have objected to Trump using their songs, including Rihanna, Neil Young, Linkin Park, the late Tom Petty and Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler.

date: 2024-03-04, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>In its recent quarterly results, Paramount said it would continue several cost-cutting experiments it began in response to last year&#8217;s months-long strikes. That’s something it seems every media company is trying to do these days. What will it likely look like? More reality TV, foreign programming and live sports. Also on the show: unpacking what&#8217;s included in the the latest government spending bills and explaining the European Union&#8217;s $2 billion Apple fine.</p>

## Moscow's History of Unforced Errors Is the West's Hidden Advantage

date: 2024-03-04, updated: 2024-03-04, from: RAND blog

In challenging the West, Russia often shoots itself in the foot. It has done so again with the murder of Alexei Navalny on the cusp of a Ukraine vote in Congress. While policymakers cannot count on Russian blunders continuing, it's worth considering the number of unforced errors Moscow has committed over the years and their consequences.

John Kerry nears last day as climate envoy </h3><p><strong></strong>This week marks the end of an era in climate diplomacy: John Kerry, the first special presidential envoy for climate, is leaving government. On Wednesday he’ll hand the reins to White House senior advisor John Podesta, though Kerry plans to stay involved in the global fight against climate change on a less formal level. “The reason that I’ve decided to transition from this job is not because we’re finished,” he <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3c6361e95e&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> the <em>Financial Times</em>. “But as U.S. envoy, I’m presently responsible for the U.S. position, for what we’re doing here. If I’m out there as a citizen, I’m able to work with whoever I choose to work with in order to help accelerate this [transition away from fossil fuels].” Specifically, he plans to focus on securing more funding for the energy transition, having <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b6e87b8944&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expressed</a> frustration about paltry commitments from the U.S. toward climate funds.</p><h3>2. Scientists connect the dots between Texas fire and climate change </h3><p><strong></strong>Texas’ Smokehouse Creek fire <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d7fcf6aaf6&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">continued to burn</a> over the weekend, and attempts to bring it under control were hampered by warm temperatures and strong winds. It has so far burned more than 1 million acres and is the largest fire in the state’s history. Two people are known to have died in the blaze. On top of the threat to human life is the danger posed to the millions of cattle that graze in the Texas Panhandle. The fire has scorched grassland and left farmers without food or water for their herds.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">

BYD slashes price of best-selling EV</h3><p><strong></strong>Chinese carmaker BYD released a new version of its best-selling EV today at a price that’s nearly 12% lower than the final sale price of its predecessor, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=682613a533&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">according to</a> <em>Reuters</em>. In China, the new Yuan Plus crossover (known overseas as the Atto 3) will cost 119,800 yuan, or about $16,644. “That price puts the compact SUV at around the same price as [internal combustion engine] rivals including the Honda XR-V, the Buick Envision Plus, and the Volkswagen T-Cross,” Jennifer Mossalgue <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=d80f7d2195&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> at <em>Electrek</em>. Last week Stella Li, CEO of BYD Americas, said the company wasn’t interested in entering the U.S. market, but major price cuts by the world’s biggest seller of EVs will ripple through the global market, and the Biden administration knows it: Last week President Biden announced an investigation into security threats posed by Chinese EVs, a sign that “the backlash to Chinese EVs has begun in earnest in the U.S.,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=370fdb0a54&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote<em> Heatmap</em>’s Robinson Meyer</a>.</p><h3>4. BlackRock pivots from ESG to ‘transition investing’</h3><p><strong></strong>ESG is out. “Transition investing” is in. A new<em> Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=45d74b6cdf&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> explains how BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is carefully continuing a climate investing strategy while simultaneously attempting to sidestep ESG backlash. The company has stopped trying to change how companies behave, talking about social issues, or fussing over criteria for responsible investing. Instead it’s betting on clean-energy infrastructure projects that will speed the transition away from fossil fuels, a strategy it calls “transition investing.” ESG was too vague, sources said, and failed to outpace the market or prove good for the planet. Meanwhile, private renewable-energy and broad energy-sector investment funds have raised nearly $500 billion over the last five years “and dwarfed the amount raised for traditional fossil-fuel funds,” the <em>Journal</em> reported. “The mega infrastructure projects are the new ESG,” said Peter McKillop, a former spokesman at BlackRock. “Energy-transition infrastructure — Wall Street loves this because it’s real.”</p><h3>5. MethaneSAT scheduled for launch today</h3><p><strong></strong>A satellite that will monitor methane leaks from space is set to hitch a ride on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launching from California’s Vandenberg Space Force Base this afternoon. MethaneSAT was developed by the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) to detect methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is released in large quantities from power plants and factories. The <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=753147fc29&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">washing-machine-sized craft</a> will orbit Earth 15 times each day and observe 80% to 90% of global oil and gas infrastructure using a high-resolution infrared sensor. It can see how much methane is leaking, where it’s coming from, and whether a leak is getting better (or worse) over time. The team will analyze the data using cloud computing and Google-developed AI technology, and then release the findings to the public, with the hopes of fostering greater accountability from the offenders. But, “there’s no guarantee that this information leads to a change in behavior,” Drew Shindell, an earth-science professor at Duke University, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5458013ad5&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>The New York Times</em>.

## Pluralistic: The real problem with anonymity (04 Mar 2024)

date: 2024-03-04, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links The real problem with anonymity: The banal anonymity of evil. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Podcasts, events and more. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The real problem with anonymity (permalink) According to "the greater internet fuckwad theory," the ills of the internet can be traced to anonymity: Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total Fuckwad https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/greater-internet-fuckwad-theory This isn't merely wrong, it's dangerously wrong. The idea that forcing people to identify themselves online will improve discourse is demonstrably untrue. Facebook famously adopted its "real names" policy because Mark Zuckerberg claimed to believe that "Having two identities for yourself is an example of a lack of integrity": https://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2010/05/14/facebook-and-radical-transparency-a-rant.html In service to this claimed belief, Zuckerberg kicked off the "nym wars," turning himself into the sole arbiter of what each person's true name was, with predictably tragicomic consequences: https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/ Facebook is, famously, one of the internet's most polluted reservoirs of toxic interpersonal conduct. That's not despite the fact that people have to use their "real" names to participate there, but because of it. After all, the people who are most vulnerable to bullying and harassment are the ones who choose pseudonyms or anonymity so that they can speak freely. Forcing people to use their "real names" means that the most powerful bullies speak with impunity, and their victims are faced with the choice of retreat or being targeted offline. This can be a matter of life and death. Cambodian dictator Hun Sen uses Facebook's real names policy to force dissidents to unmask themselves, which exposes them to arbitrary detention, torture, and extrajudicial killing. For members of the Cambodian diaspora, the choice is to unmask themselves or expose their family back home to retaliation: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/facebook-cambodia-democracy Some of the biggest internet fuckwads I've ever met &#8211; and I've met some big ones! &#8211; were utterly unashamed about using their real names. Some of the nicest people I know online have never told me their offline names. Greater internet fuckwad theory is just plain wrong. But that doesn't mean that anonymity is totally harmless. There is a category of person who reliably uses a certain, specific kind of anonymity to do vicious things that inflicts serious harm on whole swathes of people: corporate bullies. Take Tinyletter. Tinyletter is a beloved newsletter app that was created to help people who just wanted to talk to others, without a thought to going viral or getting rich. It was sold to Mailchimp, which was sold to Intuit, who killed it: https://www.theverge.com/24085737/tinyletter-mailchimp-shut-down-email-newsletters Tinyletter was a perfect little gem of a service. It cost almost nothing to run, and made an enormous number of peoples' lives better every day. Shutting it down was an act of corporate depravity by some faceless Intuit manager who woke up one day and said "Fuck all those people. Just fuck them." No one knows who that person was. That person will never have to look those people in the eyes &#8211; those people whose lives were made poorer for that Intuit executive's indifference. That person is the greater fuckwad, and that fuckwaddery depends on their anonymity. Or take Pixsy, a corporate shakedown outfit that helps copyleft trolls trick people into making tiny errors in Creative Commons attributions and then intimidates them into handing over thousands of dollars: https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/24/a-bug-in-early-creative-commons-licenses-has-enabled-a-new-breed-of-superpredator/ Copyleft trolling is an absolutely depraved practice, a petty grift practiced by greedy fuckwads who are completely indifferent to the harm they cause &#8211; even if it means bankrupting volunteer-run nonprofits for a buck: https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/02/commafuckers-versus-the-commons/ Pixsy claims that it is proud of its work "defending artists' rights," but when I named the personnel who signed their names to these profoundly unethical legal threats, Pixsy CEO Kain Jones threatened to sue me: https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/13/an-open-letter-to-pixsy-ceo-kain-jones-who-keeps-sending-me-legal-threats/ The expectation of corporate anonymity runs deep and the press is surprisingly complicit. I once spent weeks working on an investigative story about a multinational corporation's practices. I spent hours on the phone with the company's VP of communications, over the course of many calls. When we were done, they said, "Now, of course, you can't name me in the article. All of that has to be attributed to 'a spokesperson.'" I was baffled. Nothing this person said was a secret. They weren't blowing the whistle. They weren't leaking secrets. They were a corporate official, telling me the official corporate line. But they wouldn't sign their name to it. I wrote an article about for the Guardian. It was the only Guardian column any of my editors there ever rejected, in more than a decade of writing for them: https://memex.craphound.com/2012/05/14/anodyne-anonymity/ Given the press's deference to this anodyne anonymity, it's no wonder that official spokespeople expect this kind of anonymity. I routinely receive emails from corporate spokespeople disputing my characterization of their employer's conduct, but insisting that I not attribute their dubious &#8211; and often blatantly false &#8211; statements to them by name. These are the greater corporate fuckwads, who commit their sins from behind a veil of anonymity. That brand of bloodless viciousness, depravity and fraud absolutely depends on anonymity. Mark Zuckerberg claimed that "multiple identities" enabled bad behavior &#8211; as though it was somehow healthy for people to relate to their bosses, lovers, parents, toddlers and barbers in exactly the same way. Zuckerberg's motivation was utterly transparent: having "multiple identities" doesn't mean you "lack integrity" &#8211; it just makes it harder to target you for ads. But Zuckerberg couldn't enshittify Facebook on his own. For that, he relies on a legion of anonymous Facebook managers. Some of these people undoubtably speak up for Facebook users' interests when their colleagues propose putting them in harm's way for the sake of some arbitrary KPI. But the ones who are making those mean little decisions? They absolutely rely on anonymity to do their dirty work.

## Apple Fined Nearly $2 Billion by EU Over Music Streaming Competition

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

London — The European Union leveled its first antitrust penalty against Apple on Monday, fining the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion for breaking the bloc's competition laws by unfairly favoring its own music streaming service over rivals.


Apple banned app developers from "fully informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services outside of the app," said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive arm and top antitrust enforcer.


"This is illegal, and it has impacted millions of European consumers," Margrethe Vestager, the EU's competition commissioner, said at a news conference.


Apple behaved this way for almost a decade, which meant many users paid "significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions," the commission said.


The 1.8 billion-euro fine follows a long-running investigation triggered by a complaint from Swedish streaming service Spotify five years ago.


The EU has led global efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies, including a series of multbillion-dollar fines for Google and charging Meta with distorting the online classified ad market. The commission also has opened a separate antitrust investigation into Apple's mobile payments service.


Apple hit back at both the commission and Spotify, saying it would appeal the penalty.


"The decision was reached despite the Commission's failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast," the company said in a statement.


It said Spotify stood to benefit from the decision, asserting that the Swedish streaming service that holds a 56% share of Europe's music streaming market and doesn't pay Apple for using its App Store met 65 times with the commission over eight years.


"Ironically, in the name of competition, today's decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market's runaway leader," Apple said.


The commission's investigation initially centered on two concerns. One was the iPhone maker's practice of forcing app developers that are selling digital content to use its in-house payment system, which charges a 30% commission on all subscriptions.


But the EU later dropped that to focus on how Apple prevents app makers from telling their users about cheaper ways to pay for subscriptions that don't involve going through an app.


The investigation found that Apple banned streaming services from telling users about how much subscription offers cost outside of their apps, including links in their apps to pay for alternative subscriptions or even emailing users to tell them about different pricing options.


The fine comes the same week that new EU rules are set to kick in that are aimed at preventing tech companies from dominating digital markets.


The Digital Markets Act, due to take effect Thursday, imposes a set of do's and don'ts on "gatekeeper" companies including Apple, Meta, Google parent Alphabet, and TikTok parent ByteDance — under threat of hefty fines.


The DMA's provisions are designed to prevent tech giants from the sort of behavior that's at the heart of the Apple investigation. Apple has already revealed how it will comply, including allowing iPhone users in Europe to use app stores other than its own and enabling developers to offer alternative payment systems.


The commission also has opened a separate antitrust investigation into Apple's mobile payments service, and the company has promised to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals in order to resolve it.

## What to make of New York Community Bank’s “material weaknesses”

date: 2024-03-04, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Regional lender New York Community Bancorp has already had a rocky year so far and recently replaced its CEO following revelations of “material weaknesses.” NYCB acquired nearly $40 billion in assets last year from the failing Signature Bank, and that rapid growth can make it hard for internal controls to keep up. Also, a federal judge in Alabama struck down an anti-money-laundering law. And interest rates aren&#8217;t included in inflation calculations. What gives?</p>

## LLM Prompt Injection Worm

date: 2024-03-04, updated: 2024-03-01, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Researchers have <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/compromptmized">demonstrated</a> a worm that spreads through prompt injection. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/here-come-the-ai-worms/">Details</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In one instance, the researchers, acting as attackers, wrote an email including the adversarial text prompt, which &#8220;poisons&#8221; the database of an email assistant using <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/">retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</a>, a way for LLMs to pull in extra data from outside its system. When the email is retrieved by the RAG, in response to a user query, and is sent to GPT-4 or Gemini Pro to create an answer, it &#8220;jailbreaks the GenAI service&#8221; and ultimately steals data from the emails, Nassi says. &#8220;The generated response containing the sensitive user data later infects new hosts when it is used to reply to an email sent to a new client and then stored in the database of the new client,&#8221; Nassi says...</p></blockquote>

## A Carbon Tax Is Back on the Table

date: 2024-03-04, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTYwNzE1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczNTExOTEyNX0.WqATgTMfy6-x4C7spjH1BZ_7kwglqT_E5CdReac8t7Y/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Climate policy has been all over the place lately thanks to pressure from interest groups, pre-election jitters, and the plausibility of a re-elected President Donald Trump <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_blank">laying waste</a> to existing climate policy.</p><p>But further in the future, beyond the ups and downs of electoral politics, there’s a policy cataclysm coming that, some hope, could create an opening for that long sought, always denied dream of climate policy: the carbon tax.</p><p>Let’s back up. There are two things happening that might free up this policy space, one domestic, and the other overseas. At the end of 2025, much of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, otherwise known as <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47846" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Trump tax cuts</a>, will expire, including several provisions that many in Congress will want to extend, including lower income tax rates, a higher standard deduction and personal exemption, and an expanded child tax credit.</p><p>At the same time, much of the revenue that helped pay for those tax cuts — such as limitations on deductions for mortgage interest and state and local taxes — will also expire.</p><p>Measures that reduce taxes tend to be popular and those that raise them tend <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620304588" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not to be</a>, and that’s as true with the Trump tax cuts as with anything. (Since basically the day the TCJA passed, there’s been intense bipartisan opposition to the limitation on deductions for state and local taxes, for example.) That they’re expiring all at the same time will create a policy free for all.</p><p>And just as the Trump tax cuts expire, the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will come into full effect in January 2026, complementing its existing cap-and-trade and carbon pricing system. Essentially, CBAM is a tariff on imports from countries that don’t price carbon the same way the EU does, and it’s designed to prevent what’s known as “leakage,” where producers in countries with a carbon price simply offshore emissions-intensive production to countries that don’t. (It also helps make sure those products from other countries aren’t able to undercut domestic producers on price, a facet of the policy some have pooh-poohed as <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-brazil-eu-carbon-tax" target="_blank">protectionist</a>.)</p><p>Starting last year, EU trading partners had to begin reporting the carbon content of some emissions-intensive exports in preparations for payments starting in 2026. One of those trading partners is the United States, which exports some <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions#:~:text=The%20top%20five%20purchasers%20of,United%20Kingdom%20(%2476.2%20billion)." target="_blank">$351 billion worth of goods</a> to the EU, second only to Canada.</p><p>Bills that would just address the carbon price gap have been proposed several times in the current Congress, including by climate stalwart and Democrat from Rhode Island, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, plus some Republicans who think America should get an <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/foreign-pollution-fee-act-of-2023-lindsey-graham-bill-cassidy" target="_blank">advantage over China</a> for having a less carbon-intensive manufacturing sector.</p><p>This all creates a kind of celestial alignment in favor of a policy that has been rejected so many times (RIP the 2009 cap-and-trade bill and Bill Clinton’s BTU Tax) — or at least that’s what its advocates hope. Based on the history of carbon taxation and related polices, you might be pessimistic. But we haven’t seen a year like 2025.</p><p>“If you think about carbon price relative to raising people’s income taxes, when you put it in the whole fiscal conversation that’s going to happen in 2025, it’s going to look more attractive,” Catherine Wolfram, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and former Treasury official in the Biden administration, told me. Wolfram was also one of the authors of a paper released last week by the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/20240227_THP_ClimateTaxPaper.pdf" target="_blank">mapping out how various climate policies</a> could emerge from the witch’s brew of TCJA expiring and carbon tariffs would actually effect U.S. emissions.<br/></p><p>The paper concluded that of the seven 2025 climate policy options they considered — including doing nothing to the IRA and enacting planned new emissions rules, doing nothing to the IRA with no new emissions rules, repealing the IRA, expanding the IRA tax credits for clean electricity, instituting a carbon fee starting at $15 a ton, instituting a clean electricity standard that would mandate a certain portion of electricity be produced from non-carbon-emitting sources with fees for noncompliance, and a carbon fee along with repealing some parts of the IRA — the carbon fee and the clean electricity standard would bring emissions down by the most, just missing the stated 2030 target.</p><p>And that’s just U.S. emissions. Wolfram said that if the U.S. were to institute a carbon fee, it would be a major step towards a worldwide carbon price, as countries would want to avoid paying fees to both the U.S. <em>and</em> Europe for pollution-intensive exports. “The more countries that get in this game,” Wolfram said, “the more powerful that policy can be.”</p><p>Whitehouse spoke at a Brookings event last week, saying, “We’ll find out a lot when people start getting tariffed through the European Union CBAM,” and that even Republicans were “pricing curious” due to the specter of carbon tariffs. “The forces are converging on making that work,” he added about the idea of finally getting a carbon price of our own.</p><p>Wolfram is also — cautiously — optimistic. “We haven’t tried since 2009. That’s 15 years ago,” she said. “The climate continues to change, and it’s changed pretty dramatically in the last 15 years. I don’t think we should have too many conclusions about what’s possible.”</p><p><em>Editor’s note: This story has been corrected to reflect that Whitehouse is a Senator from Rhode Island.</em><br/></p>

## March 3, 2024

date: 2024-03-04, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

This week seems likely to be packed with news. Today, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke about the crisis in the Middle East with strong words for both Hamas and Israel, calling for a ceasefire of at least six weeks, the return of hostages, and increased aid to the Palestinians. Such a deal is on the table. According to the U.S., Israel has agreed to it, and negotiators are waiting for a response from Hamas leaders.

## Ear Cuffs

date: 2024-03-04, from: Jessica Smith's blog

<p>For a while now, I&rsquo;ve been enamoured with a certain style of ear jewellery demonstrated here by Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor:</p>
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto auto; grid-gap: 0.5rem;">
	<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2024/03/ear-cuffs/jodie-whittaker1.jpg" class="glightbox" data-gallery="ear-cuffs"

	  alt="Crop of a BBC publicity image, showing Jodie Whittaker in 3/4 profile view. The focus of the shot is her earring: there&#39;s an earlobe stud of two hands shaking, and a little silver chain running from that to an ear cuff in the shape of a bunch of stars at the top of her ear."
	  loading="lazy" class="u-photo u-featured"></a>
	<a href="https://www.jayeless.net/2024/03/ear-cuffs/jodie-whittaker2.jpg" class="glightbox" data-gallery="ear-cuffs"
	  style="aspect-ratio: 3 / 4;"><img

	  alt="A screenshot from a Doctor Who episode, showing Jodie Whittaker facing the camera, with her hair tucked behind her left ear, allowing the ear stud on that ear to come to prominence."

</div>
<p>Basically, jewellery that spans the whole height of the ear! I love it. I never looked into it too seriously for myself, because I presumed jewellery like this required multiple piercings, and currently I have <em>zero</em> piercings (not out of any opposition to them, I&rsquo;ve just never gone out of my way to do the research that&rsquo;d be required to get any). However, yesterday I decided to finally look it up.</p>
<p>I discovered that this whole-ear-spanning jewellery is a variety of <b>ear cuff</b>, and that actually, ear cuffs don&rsquo;t necessarily require any piercings at all! (Although Jodie Whittaker&rsquo;s specific ear cuff <em>does</em> require a piercing through the earlobe.) The idea is that they sit tight around the ear, being shaped to closely hug the contours. They could hardly be more perfect for me!</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;ve been browsing Etsy and found that <a href="https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/StrangeThingJewelry" title="StrangeThingJewelry on Etsy">this seller<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&thinsp;<svg style="height: 0.7em; width: 0.7em;" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="external-link-alt" class="svg-inline--fa fa-external-link-alt fa-w-16" role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><title>(external link)</title><path fill="currentColor" d="M432,320H400a16,16,0,0,0-16,16V448H64V128H208a16,16,0,0,0,16-16V80a16,16,0,0,0-16-16H48A48,48,0,0,0,0,112V464a48,48,0,0,0,48,48H400a48,48,0,0,0,48-48V336A16,16,0,0,0,432,320ZM488,0h-128c-21.37,0-32.05,25.91-17,41l35.73,35.73L135,320.37a24,24,0,0,0,0,34L157.67,377a24,24,0,0,0,34,0L435.28,133.32,471,169c15,15,41,4.5,41-17V24A24,24,0,0,0,488,0Z"></path></svg></span></a>, in particular, has quite the range of beautiful (and inexpensive) whole-ear-spanning ear cuffs.

</div>
<p>(Note: this post is not an ad; having not even ordered anything yet, I can&rsquo;t even really vouch for this seller at all. This is just a post of enthusiasm for ear jewellery.) Basically, I think this style would suit me well because, as you can see from my photo on <a href="https://www.jayeless.net/">this site&rsquo;s front page</a>, I tend to tuck the hair on the left side of my head behind my ear at all times (somewhat like Jodie Whittaker does as the Doctor, in fact). I&rsquo;ve always been a bit self-conscious about this habit because the ear is a bit flattened compared to a &ldquo;normal ear&rdquo;, and when I was a little kid my mum used to chastise me for &ldquo;exposing&rdquo; it to people, as if my very ear were obscene or something. I was <em>certainly</em> never allowed to get my ears pierced, because that would only &ldquo;draw attention to [my] deformity&rdquo;. I mean, I thought she was full of shit even at the time, but after getting scolded so much I can&rsquo;t help but be hyperaware of it, either. As an adult, of course, I feel she had completely the wrong end of it. For a start, you shouldn&rsquo;t feel ashamed of your natural body in the first place. But secondly, if you really want to do something, the way to go is <strong>attention-grabbing accessories</strong>, so what sticks in people&rsquo;s mind is how <em>cool</em> your sense of style is. No one&rsquo;s going to give a fuck about a mildly flattened ear when there&rsquo;s an awesome ear cuff wrapped around it. Nobody.</p>
<p>Given the tightness of our budget lately, it&rsquo;s hard not to feel a little guilty about spending on something inessential like jewellery&hellip; but Vivian doesn&rsquo;t share the same reservations about spending, and it&rsquo;s unfair if I&rsquo;m the <em>only</em> one making sacrifices. I still want to mull it over a bit – narrow it down to <em>one</em> design to buy initially, and see how it goes – but overall I think these look cool. I want them!</p>

## Bill to Fund US Government Includes Money to Counter China in Pacific

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. congressional negotiators released a bill Sunday that would fund key parts of the government through the rest of the fiscal year, which began in October 2023.


Among provisions in the appropriations package are critical funds to counter China in the Pacific as part of an agreement signed last year called the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA.


Under the compacts, Micronesia, Palau and the Marshall Islands will receive $7 billion in economic aid over 20 years. In exchange, Washington will provide for their defense and can deny China access to their territorial waters, a maritime area larger than the continental United States.


The United States has had similar agreements in effect with Micronesia and the Marshalls since 1986 and with Palau since 1994. Citizens from these nations are allowed to travel, live and work in the United States as nonimmigrants.


Congresswoman Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, who represents the U.S. territory of American Samoa, told VOA on Sunday that House Speaker Mike Johnson reached her early Saturday morning to deliver the news.


Radewagen said she then called the presidents of the three Pacific allies to share the details.


“The COFA agreements send a clear message of U.S. commitment to the Pacific region and take a much-needed international strong stand for the ideals of democracy and freedom,” she told VOA in an email.


Senator Mazie Hirono, a Hawaii Democrat who has long supported the full funding of the agreement, issued a statement Sunday night.


“As we work to counter China’s growing influence in the Pacific, these agreements are extremely important for our national security and that of our allies, and also for the tens of thousands of COFA citizens who live, work and pay taxes in the U.S.,” she said.


The move comes after 26 senators, including Senators Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and John Barrasso, a Republican, urged Senate leadership to include the language that had previously been dropped from a Senate security spending bill on Feb. 12.






“Failure to act on COFA opens the door to more corrupting influence and funding by the PRC in the region,” wrote the senators, using an acronym for the People’s Republic of China.


Pacific Island leaders remain cautious.


President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands spoke to a Remembrance Day for victims and survivors of nuclear testing on March 1, the 70th anniversary of the U.S. nuclear test on Bikini Atoll.


“Our nation has been a steadfast ally of the United States, but that should not be taken for granted,” she told the audience, according to the news site Islands Business.


Palau President Surangel Whipps, Jr. told VOA: 


"We are heartened that the leaders of both houses of Congress and the White House have reached a consensus on the legislation slated for action this week. We thank our friends in both parties for their continued support and partnership."


U.S. lawmakers face another threat of a partial shutdown if they fail to act by midnight Friday.


House Speaker Johnson has said he will bring the compromise bill to the floor for a full house vote on Wednesday.

If the Democrats had a sense of the moment they'd run the campaign on a plan to regain control of the House and keep the Senate and White House so we can pass a law that legalizes abortion in the whole country. Give people a positive reason to elect a governing majority. Think powerfully.

## Netanyahu Rival Visits US, Signals Wider Cracks in Israel’s Wartime Leadership

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

Tel Aviv, Israel — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rebuked a top Cabinet minister arriving in Washington on Sunday for talks with U.S. officials, according to an Israeli official, signaling widening cracks within the country’s leadership nearly five months into its war with Hamas.


The trip by Benny Gantz, a centrist political rival who joined Netanyahu’s wartime Cabinet following Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, comes as friction between the U.S. and Netanyahu is rising over how to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and what the postwar plan for the enclave should look like.


An official from Netanyahu’s far-right Likud party said Gantz’s trip was planned without authorization from the Israeli leader. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Netanyahu had a “tough talk” with Gantz and told him the country has “just one prime minister.”


Gantz is scheduled to meet Monday with U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Tuesday with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, according to his National Unity Party. A second Israeli official speaking on the condition of anonymity said Gantz's visit is intended to strengthen ties with the U.S., bolster support for Israel’s war and push for the release of Israeli hostages.


In Egypt, talks were underway to broker a cease-fire before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins next week.


Israel did not send a delegation because it is waiting for answers from Hamas on two questions, according to a third Israeli government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Israeli media reported that the government is waiting to learn which hostages are alive and how many Palestinian prisoners Hamas seeks in exchange for each.


All three Israeli officials spoke anonymously because they weren’t authorized to discuss the disputes with the media.


The U.S. began airdrops of aid into Gaza on Saturday, after dozens of Palestinians rushing to grab food from an Israel-organized convoy were killed last week. The airdrops circumvented an aid delivery system hobbled by Israeli restrictions, logistical issues and fighting in Gaza. Aid officials say airdrops are far less effective than deliveries by truck.


U.S. priorities in the region have increasingly been hampered by Netanyahu’s Cabinet, which is dominated by ultranationalists. Gantz’s more moderate party at times acts as a counterweight.


Netanyahu's popularity has dropped since the war broke out, according to most opinion polls. Many Israelis hold him responsible for failing to stop the Oct. 7 cross-border terror attack by Hamas, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took roughly 250 people as hostages into Gaza, including women, children and older adults, according to Israeli authorities.


More than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, around two-thirds of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters. Around 80% of the population of 2.3 million have fled their homes, and U.N. agencies say hundreds of thousands are on the brink of famine.


Israelis critical of Netanyahu say his decision-making has been tainted by political considerations, a charge he denies. The criticism is particularly focused on plans for postwar Gaza. Netanyahu wants Israel to maintain open-ended security control over Gaza, with Palestinians running civilian affairs.


The U.S. wants to see progress on the creation of a Palestinian state, envisioning a revamped Palestinian leadership running Gaza with an eye toward eventual statehood.


That vision is opposed by Netanyahu and the hard-liners in his government. Another top Cabinet official from Gantz's party has questioned the handling of the war and the strategy for freeing the hostages.


Netanyahu's government, Israel's most conservative and religious ever, has also been rattled by a court-ordered deadline for a new bill to broaden military enlistment of ultra-Orthodox Jews. Many of them are exempt from military service so they can pursue religious studies. Hundreds of Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, and the military is looking to fill its ranks.


Gantz has remained vague about his view of Palestinian statehood. Polls show he would earn enough support to become prime minister if a vote were held today.

A visit to the U.S., if met with progress on the hostage front, could further boost Gantz’s support.


Israel and Hamas are negotiating over a possible new cease-fire and hostage release deal. Vice President Harris said Sunday it is now up to Hamas to agree to it. “Given the immense scale of suffering in Gaza, there must be an immediate cease-fire for at least the next six weeks, which is what is currently on the table,” Harris said.


Israelis, deeply traumatized by Hamas’ attack, have broadly backed the war effort as an act of self-defense, even as global opposition to the fighting has increased.


But a growing number are expressing their dismay with Netanyahu. Some 10,000 people protested late Saturday to call for early elections, according to Israeli media. Such protests have grown in recent weeks but remain much smaller than last year's demonstrations against the government's judicial overhaul plan.


If the political rifts grow and Gantz quits the government, the floodgates will open to broader protests by a public that was already unhappy with the government when Hamas struck, said Reuven Hazan, a professor of political science at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.


At least 12 people were killed, including five women and two children, in an Israeli strike Sunday that hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, according to an Associated Press journalist at Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah. And two Israeli strikes southwest of Deir al-Balah killed at least five people and destroyed an aid truck, according to witnesses and staff at the hospital.


Amid concerns about the wider regional conflict, White House senior adviser Amos Hochstein was going to Lebanon on Monday to meet officials, according to an administration official who was not authorized to comment. White House officials want Lebanese and Israeli officials to prevent tensions along their border from worsening.

## Congressional Leaders Come Out With 6 Spending Bills in Drive to Avoid Partial Shutdown

date: 2024-03-04, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Congressional leaders on Sunday came out with a package of six bills setting full-year spending levels for some federal agencies, a step forward in a long overdue funding process beset by sharp political divisions between the two parties as well as infighting among House Republicans.


The release of the text of legislation over the weekend was designed to meet the House's rule to give lawmakers at least 72 hours to study a bill before voting. And it's a promising sign that lawmakers will avoid a partial shutdown that would kick in at 12:01 a.m. Saturday for those agencies covered under the bill, such as Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Transportation, Justice and others.


Congressional leaders hope to complete votes on the package this week and continue negotiations on the remaining six annual spending bills to pass them before a March 22 deadline. The price tag for the package out Sunday comes to about $460 billion, representing less than 30% of the discretionary spending Congress looks to approve for this year. The package still being negotiated includes defense spending.


House Speaker Mike Johnson highlighted some key policy and spending wins for conservatives, even as many of his Republican colleagues consider the changes inadequate. Some House Republicans had hoped the prospect of a shutdown could leverage more concessions from Democrats.


Overall, this year's spending bills would keep non-defense spending relatively flat with last year's bill, despite the rise in inflation, and some $70 billion less than what President Joe Biden originally sought.


"House Republicans secured key conservative policy victories, rejected left-wing proposals, and imposed sharp cuts to agencies and programs critical to President Biden's agenda," Johnson said in a prepared statement.


Earlier this year, Johnson and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced an agreement on the top-line spending levels for this year's discretionary spending, which comes to more than $1.6 trillion. But that agreement didn't address potential policy mandates placed within the bills. That's where negotiations have focused in recent weeks.


Democrats staved off most of the policy riders that House Republicans sought to include. For example, they beat back an effort to reverse the FDA's decision that allows the abortion pill mifepristone to be sold in retail pharmacies, instead of only in hospitals, clinics and medical offices. Democrats also said the bill would fully fund a nutrition program for low-income women, infants and children known as WIC, providing about $7 billion for the program, a $1 billion increase from the previous year.


"Throughout the negotiations, Democrats fought hard to protect against cuts to housing and nutrition programs and keep out harmful provisions that would further restrict access to women's health or roll back the progress we've made to fight climate change," Schumer, said in support of the legislation.


House Republicans were able to achieve some policy wins, however. One provision, for example, will prevent the sale of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China.


Another provision strengthens gun rights for certain veterans. Under current law, the VA must send a beneficiary's name to the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever a fiduciary is appointed to help manage someone's benefits. This year's spending package prohibits the VA from transmitting that information unless a relevant judicial authority rules that the beneficiary is a danger to himself or herself, or others.


Still, some of the more conservative members of the House Republicans have been critical of the spending bills, and many voted against the short-term extension Congress passed last week that avoided a shutdown and allowed negotiations to continue.


"We all promised we wouldn't do this crap when we got up here," Rep. Eric Burlison, a Republican, said as the short-term extension was debated. "The American people have demanded responsible spending and border security for years, but we fail them. When will we heed the calls of our constituents to rein in the wasteful spending, secure the borders, and defeat the bureaucracy targeting them?"


The short-term extension last week was the fourth in recent months. The vote to approve it was 320-99, but House Republicans were divided, with 113 in support and 97 against. The Senate approved the extension, 77-13.


The votes being teed up on spending bills come five months after the budget year began.

## pg_ivm 1.8 released

date: 2024-03-04, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>IVM Development Group is pleased to announce the release of <a href="https://github.com/sraoss/pg_ivm/releases/tag/v1.8">pg_ivm 1.8</a>.</p>
<p>Changes since the v1.7 release include:</p>
<h3>Bug fixes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consider tuple duplicity in maintenance of EXISTS views (Yugo Nagata)</p>
<p>Previously, the duplicity of row was not considered and only one tuple was inserted
even when duplicated tuples are generated as a result of inserting a tuple into a table
in an EXISTS subquery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix checking for expressions containing an EXISTS subquery (Takuma Hoshiai, Yugo Nagata)</p>
<p>EXISTS subquery is currently allowed only directly under WHERE clause or in AND
expression that is directly under WHERE. However, the check was insufficient previously
so that views using expressions other than AND containing an EXISTS subquery could be
created without an error and it caused incorrect maintenance results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if PgIvmImmvRelationId is invalid before open it (Colin Zhao)</p>
<p>Fix an error that occurs at dropping tables that occurs when pg_ivm is installed by
shared_preload_libraries without executing CREATE EXTENSION command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix an error raised when dropping pg_ivm extension (Yugo Nagata)</p>
<p>Previously, DROP EXTENSION pg_ivm failed due to the failure of opening the index
on the pg_ivm_immv catalog table, because the index had been already dropped
at that time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>About pg_ivm</h3>
<p>pg_ivm is an extension module that provides Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) feature.</p>
<p>Incremental View Maintenance (IVM) is a way to make materialized views up-to-date in
which only incremental changes are computed and applied on views rather than recomputing. 
pg_ivm provides a kind of immediate maintenance, in which materialized views are updated
immediately after a base table is modified.</p>
