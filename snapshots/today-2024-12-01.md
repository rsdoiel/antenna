## OpenWrt One router is now available for $89

date: 2024-12-01, from: Liliputing

<p>OpenWrt is a free and open source, Linux-based operating system designed for routers and other networking applications. While it&#8217;s most often used as an aftermarket replacement for the firmware that comes pre-installed on a router, earlier this year the OpenWrt team announced it was partnering with Banana Pi to design and sell the first router [&#8230;]</p>

## The FreshWash Clip – Every home should have one!

## Me and Skiing

date: 2024-12-01, from: Chris Coyier blog

I don&#8217;t seem like I&#8217;d be much of a skiier, do I? (I do not.) But here I am, doing skiing. It&#8217;s very (very) popular in Bend, Oregon because of the proximity to Mt. Bachelor (and to a lesser degree Hoodoo) and the outdoor lifestyle vibes here. People you know will be downhill skiing in [&#8230;]

## Wisdom of the crowds, or lowest common denominator?

date: 2024-12-01, from: Status-Q blog

I liked this: People have too inflated sense of what it means to &#8220;ask an AI&#8221; about something. The AI are language models trained basically by imitation on data from human labelers. Instead of the mysticism of &#8220;asking an AI&#8221;, think of it more as &#8220;asking the average data labeler&#8221; on the internet. &#8230; But <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/12/01/12284/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## FAQs are not the answer

date: 2024-11-30, from: Blog by Fabrizio Ferri-Benedetti

<p>Everybody loves to hate Frequently Asked Questions, or FAQs. More often than not, technical writers pale and stagger at the sight of hefty, unsorted FAQs, as if they were beholding a writhing mass of primal chaos. Others value their pragmatic qualities: FAQs, they say, lower the bar to contribution and are good fuel for LLMs and search engines. My opinion is that FAQs pose a problem only when there&rsquo;s no strategy around their usage.</p>

I wasn&#39;t clear enough yesterday. We&#39;re losing the word &quot;podcast&quot; very quickly. It&#39;s coming to mean video interviews on YouTube. Our only hope is upgrading the open platform in a way that stimulates the imagination of creators, and there&#39;s no time to waste.

<h2>Summary Of Changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>100r.co</b>, added an article named <a href="https://100r.co/site/shining_sand.html">A Shining Place Built Upon The Sand</a>, and <a href="https://100r.co/site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html#week6">Week 6</a> to the <a href="https://100r.co/site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html">Victoria to Sitka Logbook</a>.</li>
  <li><b><a href="https://100r.co/site/rabbit_waves.html">Rabbit Waves</a></b>, added a page on <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/morse.html" target="_blank">Morse Code</a> and on <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/morse_flags.html" target="_blank">Morse Code with flags</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Our website has a new look! The illustrated algae-eared rabbit nav helped solve the problem of navigating on mobile. We added a lot of information to this wiki over the years, creating separate portals for its evergrowing content was inevitable, we hope you like the re-design. Some of the content has shifted, and we've simplified many of the pages.</p>

<p>A couple of folks on <a href="https://merveilles.town" target="_blank">Merveilles</a> got together recently and made a Diablo Tribute tape. A limited run of physical cassettes are currently in production, but in the meantime the tribute album is available to download on <a href="https://spectralepoch.bandcamp.com/album/a-tribute-to-diablo" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a>.</p>

<p>Next month on December 6th, Devine will share the stage with Iszoloscope, Oddie(Orphx) & Creature at Foufounes Electriques in Montréal as part of <a href="https://ampindustrialevents.com/index.html" target="_blank">AMP Industrial Events</a>. Then on the 7th, we will both(remotely) present a summary of all the interesting analog communication schemes that inspired and found their way into <a href="https://100r.co/site/rabbit_waves.html">Rabbit Waves</a> and <a href="https://100r.co/site/wiktopher.html">Wiktopher</a> for <a href="https://creativecodingutrecht.nl/en/calendar/iterations-2024" target="_blank">Iterations 2024</a> organized by Creative Coding Utrecht.</p>

<p>Devine's talk for Handmade Seattle 2024 entitled A Shining Palace Built Upon the Sand was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OfnEfFb8yks&t=1908s" target="_blank">released online</a>(YouTube), we also released the <a href="https://100r.co/site/shining_sand.html">written transcript</a>.</p>

<p>Due to the ongoing Canada Post strike we had to close the sale of stickers in our <a href="https://100r.co/site/store.html">store</a>, we'll let you know once we resume operations (this also applies to Patreon supporters, we'll ship perks your way as soon as we can).</p>

<p><b>Book Club:</b> This month we are still reading <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i> by Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>
