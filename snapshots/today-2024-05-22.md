## Republican National Committee evacuates after receiving blood vials

date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The headquarters of the Republican National Committee in Washington was briefly evacuated Wednesday morning after a suspicious package containing two vials of blood was delivered to the building, the police said. 


The RNC, the parent organization of the Republican Party, is playing a major role in the campaign of former President Donald Trump, who will face Democratic incumbent Joe Biden in the November 5 presidential election.  


The authorities initially closed off one downtown block and directed staff and other personnel to avoid the area. By midmorning, employees were reentering the building and police were leaving the scene, according to a Reuters witness.  


"The source of the package and its contents will be further investigated," the U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement. 


The RNC did not respond to a request for comment.

## White House chef duo has dished up culinary diplomacy at state dinners for nearly a decade

date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A house-cured smoked salmon, red grapefruit, avocado and cucumber starter. Dry-aged rib eye beef in a sesame sabayon sauce. Salted caramel pistachio cake under a layer of matcha ganache.


While President Joe Biden and his guest of honor at a White House state dinner chew over foreign policy, the female chef duo of Cris Comerford and Susie Morrison take care of the culinary diplomacy. They pulled off the above menu for Japan's leader in April, and they'll have a new array of delicacies for Kenya's president on Thursday night.




Comerford, the White House executive chef, and Morrison, the executive pastry chef, are the first women to hold those posts, forming a duo that has tantalized the taste buds of guests at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. with their culinary creations for nearly a decade. Comerford is also the first person of color to be executive chef.


“Both are just exceptional examples of success in their field,” said Bill Yosses, who was the executive pastry chef for seven years before his departure in 2014 cleared the way for Morrison to be promoted. “They excel at what they do.”




Comerford and Morrison get to do it again Thursday when Biden and his wife, first lady Jill Biden, host the administration's sixth state dinner, for Kenyan President William Ruto and his wife, Rachel. It will be the first such honor for an African head of state since 2008 and the first for Kenya since 2003.


A lavish state dinner is a tool of U.S. diplomacy, a high honor reserved for America's longstanding and closest allies. In the case of Kenya, Biden wants to elevate a relationship that he sees as critical to security in Africa and far beyond.


Jill Biden planned to preview the dinner setup for the news media on Wednesday afternoon.




State dinner planning is done by the first lady's staff and the White House social office, and starts months in advance. Ideas are kicked around before the chefs propose a few different menus. The meals are prepared, plated as they would be served and tasted by the social secretary and the first lady, who makes the final call on what will be served.


The menus change, but the overarching goal has stayed the same.


“We're trying to showcase American food, American regions, American farmers,” while incorporating small tributes to the guest of honor, Yosses said. “It would be rare that we would really try to imitate something from the guest's country.”


Ingredients for April's state dinner for Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his wife, Yuko, came from California, Maryland, Oregon and Ohio. The wines were from Oregon and Washington state.




At the media preview for that glitzy event, Comerford explained that the diets of the Bidens and the visiting dignitaries are factored into the preparations, along with those of other guests.


“When we formulate and we create the state dinner menu, we take into consideration all the principals and most of our guests,” she said. “We also take into consideration the season because this is the perfect time for some beautiful bounties right now, with the spring coming up, with all the morels and the mushrooms, and Susie's cherries and all the stuff she has on her plate.”


The chefs contact their regular purveyors to find out what's in season, and go from there.


The salmon appetizer served in April was inspired by the California roll, which Comerford said was invented by a Japanese chef.


Morrison's dessert highlighted Japan's gift of cherry trees to the United States, many of which are planted in Washington, and its matcha tea. She decorated the pistachio cake with sugary mini cherry blossoms.


“We wanted to bring a little bit of the cherry blossoms that are here on the Tidal Basin right here to our dessert in order for everyone to enjoy the cherry blossoms that we enjoy every year,” she said.


Serving dinner to hundreds of guests at once comes down to timing. Thursday's event will be held in an expansive pavilion put up on the South Grounds of the White House.


Sam Kass, who was an assistant chef during President Barack Obama's administration, said tradition holds that the president is the first one served and that plates are cleared away when he is finished eating.


“You have to have a service that is so efficient and quick to get those plates out so that the last table has a chance to eat,” he said.


Comerford, 61, sharpened her culinary skills while working at hotels in Chicago and restaurants in Washington before the White House brought her on in 1995 as an assistant chef. A naturalized U.S. citizen and Filipino native, she was named executive chef in 2005. Her responsibilities include designing and executing menus for state dinners, social events, holiday functions, receptions and official luncheons.


Morrison, 57, started at the executive mansion as a contract pastry employee in 1995 while she was working at a hotel in northern Virginia. She was named an assistant pastry chef in 2002 and became the executive pastry chef in November 2014 — just in time to sweat over the details of that year's gingerbread White House for the holiday season.


The pair has worked together at the White House for nearly 30 years.


Yosses recalled at least one instance where the honoree's wishes dictated the menu selections.


In 2015, China's Xi Jinping wanted a very American menu, “which I think was a polite way for him to say that he didn't think we could do Chinese food very well," Yosses said.


The Chinese leader was served butter-poached Maine lobster and grilled Colorado lamb.

## Tornado kills multiple people in Iowa as storms tear through Midwest

date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA

GREENFIELD, Iowa — Multiple people were killed when a tornado tore through a small town in Iowa and left a wide swath of obliterated homes and crumpled cars, while the howling winds also twisted and toppled wind turbines. 


After devastating Greenfield, a town of 2,000, on Tuesday the storms moved eastward to pummel parts of Illinois and Wisconsin, knocking out power to tens of thousands of customers in the two states. 


Greenfield's hospital was among the buildings that were damaged in the town, which meant that at least a dozen people who were hurt had to be taken to facilities elsewhere, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla. 


"Sadly we can confirm that there have been fatalities," Dinkla said at a news conference Tuesday night, without specifying how many. "We're still counting at this time." 




He said he thought they had accounted for all of the town's residents but that searches would continue if anyone was reported missing. The Adair County Health System said in a Facebook post Tuesday night that it had set up a triage center at the Greenfield high school and that people who need medical attention should go there. 


The tornado destroyed much of Greenfield, which is located about 55 miles (90 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines, during a day that saw multiple tornadoes, giant hail and heavy rain in several states. The National Weather Service said it received 23 tornado reports Tuesday, with most in Iowa, and one each in Wisconsin and Minnesota. 


In Wisconsin, the weather service's Green Bay office dispatched a staffer Wednesday morning to survey storm damage near the village of Unity in western Marathon County after law enforcement received a report from the public about a tornado on the ground about 7:45 p.m. Tuesday in that community about 55 miles (89 kilometers) east of Eau Claire, said meteorologist Roy Eckberg. He said staffers would also be visiting Outagamie County near the city of Kaukauna, some 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Green Bay, to investigate significant wind damage there. 


Eckberg said high winds were reported Tuesday night across parts of central Wisconsin, with a wind gust of 70 mph (113 kilometers per hour) in the city of Marshfield and with wind damage also reported to the northwest in the city of Wausau. 


Weather service staff would also be assessing storm damage Wednesday in southeastern Minnesota after radar indicated that a tornado touched down Tuesday night in Winona County, said Kate Abbott, a meteorologist with the agency's La Crosse, Wisconsin, office. 


"With that one we did have a radar confirmed tornado, but we're going out and survey there to make sure the damage is consistent with a tornado," she said. 




Authorities announced a mandatory curfew for Greenfield and said they would only allow residents to enter the town until Wednesday morning. They also ordered media representatives to leave the city Tuesday night. 


In the aftermath of the storm, mounds of broken wood from homes, branches, car parts and other debris littered lots where homes once stood. Some trees still standing were stripped of their limbs and leaves. Residents helped each other salvage furniture and other belongings that were strewn in every direction. 


Rogue Paxton said he sheltered in the basement of his home when the storm moved through. He told WOI-TV he thought the house was lost but said his family got lucky. 


"But everyone else is not so much, like my brother Cody, his house just got wiped," Paxton said. "Then you see all these people out here helping each other. ... Everything's going to be fine because we have each other, but it's just going to be really, really rough. It is a mess." 


A tornado also apparently took down several 250-foot (76-meter) wind turbines in southwest Iowa. Some of the turbines caught fire, sending plumes of smoke into the air. Wind farms are built to withstand tornadoes, hurricanes and other powerful winds. 




Mary Long, the owner of Long's Market in downtown Greenfield, said she rode out the storm at her business in the community's historic town square, which largely escaped damage. Long said there appeared to be widespread damage on the east and south sides of town. 


"I could hear this roaring, like the proverbial freight train, and then it was just done," she said. 


Camille Blair said the Greenfield Chamber of Commerce office where she works closed around 2 p.m. ahead of the storm. 


"I can see from my house it kind of went in a straight line down the road," she said of the tornado. 


Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she planned to visit Greenfield on Wednesday morning. 


"It was just a few weeks ago that tornadoes hit several other Iowa communities, and it's hard to believe that it's happened again," she said in a statement. "Iowans are strong and resilient, and we will get through this together." 


Iowa had braced for severe weather after the weather service's Storm Prediction Center gave most of the state a high chance of seeing severe thunderstorms with the potential for strong tornadoes. The storms and tornado warnings moved into Wisconsin on Tuesday evening and night. 


Across the US


Earlier in the day, residents to the west in Omaha, Nebraska, awoke to sirens blaring and widespread power outages as torrential rain, high winds and large hail pummeled the area. The deluge flooded basements and submerged cars. Television station KETV showed firefighters rescuing people from vehicles. 


In Illinois, dust storms led authorities to shut down stretches of two interstates due to low visibility. 


The storms followed days of extreme weather that have ravaged much of the middle section of the country. Strong winds, large hail and tornadoes swept parts of Oklahoma and Kansas late Sunday, damaging homes and injuring two in Oklahoma. 


Another round of storms Monday night raked Colorado and western Nebraska and saw the city of Yuma, Colorado, blanketed in hail the size of baseballs and golf balls, turning streets into rivers of water and ice. 


In Texas, deadly storms hit the Houston area last week, killing at least eight people. Those storms last Thursday knocked out power to hundreds of thousands for days, leaving many in the dark and without air conditioning during hot and humid weather. Hurricane-force winds reduced businesses and other structures to debris and shattered glass in downtown skyscrapers. 


Bob Oravec, lead forecaster with the weather service, said the system is expected to turn south Wednesday, bringing more severe weather to parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri.

	<a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/climate-change-loans/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---SELnkEz_Wc3AO_je836IR4X_FXyRQEGT1uOLXVhfRDxHpBj1FIWLH2hF3oYaSuOoaisH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">new repor</a>t from <em>Reuters</em>. France, Japan, and Germany — the three countries that reported issuing the most climate financial aid between 2015 and 2020 — each gave more in the form of loans than they did grants, saddling already debt-burdened nations with yet more interest payments. Other aid agreements required recipients to purchase materials or employ organizations from the donor country’s own suppliers.
</p><p>
	“The benefits to donor countries disproportionately overshadow the primary objective of supporting climate action in developing countries,” Ritu Bharadwaj, principal researcher on climate governance and finance at the International Institute for Environment and Development, told 
	<em>Reuters</em>.
</p><h3>2. Solar-plus-storage projects gain ground in the West </h3><p>
	Solar projects that are co-located with storage are 
	<a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/hybrid-western-solar-storage-curtailment-caiso-ercot/716552/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---SELnkEz_Wc3AO_je836IR4X_FXyRQEGT1uOLXVhfRDxHpBj1FIWLH2hF3oYaSuOoaisH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">dominating Western interconnection queues</a>, according to an energy research analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. More than 98% of proposed solar capacity within the territory of the California Independent System Operator and about 87% of proposed solar capacity in the rest of the West is paired with storage, or, in some instances, with wind, S&P’s Adam Wilson said. Only about one-fourth of the West’s existing solar capacity is co-located with storage. Hybrid solar projects have “yet to gain firm foothold,” Wilson told <em>Utility Dive</em>, but recent data “suggest that tide may be turning.”
</p><h3>3. ICYMI: The world will be renewable-powered, even without more government help</h3><p>
	We’re almost halfway through the decade that will make or break our climate future. To get to net-zero by 2050, we’re going to have to spend a lot more money a lot more quickly.
</p><p>
	These are among the main conclusions of BloombergNEF’s 2024 
	<a href="https://about.bnef.com/new-energy-outlook/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---SELnkEz_Wc3AO_je836IR4X_FXyRQEGT1uOLXVhfRDxHpBj1FIWLH2hF3oYaSuOoaisH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">New Energy Outlook</a>, which determined that emissions will have to peak and renewable capacity will have to triple this decade for the world to hit net-zero by midcentury. Decarbonizing the global energy system within that time frame could cost $215 trillion, the report found — 19% more than the cost of an economics-driven transition that would miss the Paris Agreement goals and result in 2.6 degrees Celsius of warming. Even in that economics-driven scenario, which assumes no new climate policies other than the ones we’ve already got, renewable sources power 70% of global energy needs by 2050. The conclusions illustrate both the momentum behind the clean energy transition and the urgent need for stronger government support.

	The Adani Group, a multinational commodities trading conglomerate with close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, allegedly bought cheap, highly polluting coal and passed it off as expensive, low-polluting coal, achieving a fat profit and worsening air quality in the process, according to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7451f2de-91fa-49f3-acb3-e83ab5c00eff?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz---SELnkEz_Wc3AO_je836IR4X_FXyRQEGT1uOLXVhfRDxHpBj1FIWLH2hF3oYaSuOoaisH" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reporting</a> from the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project published in the <em>Financial Times</em>. Invoices from 2014 appear to show nearly two-dozen instances of the group buying low-grade coal from one company and selling it to another with which it had a contract to supply high-efficiency coal — 1.5 million metric tons in total. Adani Group denied the allegations, and other companies involved in the transactions did not respond to <em>FT</em>’s request for comment.

## Russia denies US charge that it put anti-satellite weapon in space

date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Russia's top arms control diplomat dismissed as "fake news" on Wednesday an assertion by the United States that Russia had launched a weapon into low-Earth orbit that was capable of inspecting and attacking other satellites.


The Kremlin has flatly denied assertions by U.S. officials that Moscow is developing a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon.


U.S. Space Command on Tuesday pointed to the launch earlier this month of a Soyuz rocket from Russia's Plesetsk launch site, saying it likely involved "a counterspace weapon presumably capable of attacking other satellites in low Earth orbit."


Russia's defense ministry said the May 17 launch had a spacecraft on board but gave no details what it was for.


"I don't think we should respond to any fake news from Washington," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.


"The Americans can say whatever they want but our policy does not change from this," said Ryabkov, adding that Moscow had "always consistently opposed the deployment of strike weapons in low-Earth orbit".


President Vladimir Putin and then-defense minister Sergei Shoigu denied U.S. assertions in February that Russia was developing a space-based anti-satellite nuclear weapon designed to disrupt everything from military communications to phone-based ride services.




U.S. Space Command said the May launch, which it dates as May 16, included COSMOS 2576, a type of Russian military "inspector" spacecraft that U.S. officials have long said exhibits reckless space behavior.


Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined specific comment on the U.S. assertion but said Russia acted in full accordance with international law.


"We are not violating anything. We have repeatedly advocated a ban on the deployment of any weapons into space. Unfortunately, our initiatives were rejected, including by the United States," Peskov told reporters.  


U.S. intelligence agencies had been expecting the launch of COSMOS 2576 and informed allies of their assessment of the satellite before its deployment in space, according to a U.S. official familiar with the intelligence. The launch also included civilian satellites deployed to different orbits.


COSMOS 2576, as of Tuesday, has not gone near a U.S. satellite, but space analysts observed it to be in the same orbital ring as USA 314, a bus-sized NRO satellite launched in April 2021.


Ryabkov said Russia's space program was developing as planned, including tasks aimed at strengthening defense capability but added that "this is also not news."


He said the United States was wrong to have dismissed Russian proposals on strengthening the security of space activities, including a proposal on developing a treaty on preventing an arms race in space.

## The U.S. Has Gotten 3 Direct Air Capture Plants in 13 Months

date: 2024-05-22, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI4NDUyNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1MDM2MzYxM30.xbg22ZLIF1DzbvQElNYgZig3Fd04lXfhGV1-4wjFKcI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	A new direct air capture facility built by the Alphabet-backed <a href="http://280.earth" target="_blank">280 Earth</a> is officially plucking carbon dioxide from the surrounding air along the Columbia River in Oregon, the company announced on Monday. It’s the third-largest “direct air capture” plant operating in the United States and the latest entrant in the race to design the cheapest, most efficient machine to strip the heat-trapping gas from the atmosphere.<br/>
</p><p>
	The small-scale demonstration project, which neighbors a Google data center in a city called The Dalles, is expected eventually to capture carbon at a rate of 500 tons per year. The two other U.S. facilities — Global Thermostat’s plant in Commerce City, Colorado, and Heirloom’s plant in Tracy, California — are both designed to capture 1,000 tons per year. All three came online in just the past 13 months. (There are also <a href="https://daccoalition.org/global-dac-deployments/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a handful of smaller facilities</u></a> operating in the U.S. that capture 100 tons per year or less.)
</p><p>
	The team that is now 280 Earth first began working on their direct air capture system inside X, the tech incubator at Google also known as the “Moonshot Factory.” They spun out into their own company in 2022, after four-and-a-half years of research and development. The name comes from 280 parts per million, the amount of carbon in the atmosphere before industrialization. Today we’ve reached nearly 420 parts per million. But if the world manages to reduce emissions nearly to zero, it may be possible to pull enough carbon out of the air to restore the atmosphere to levels closer to pre-industrial times.</p><p>
	In general, direct air capture technologies suck in ambient air and pass it through a special material called a sorbent that attracts CO2 molecules. They then use heat to remove the carbon from the sorbent so that it can be transported and safely stored underground.
</p><p>
	280 Earth’s approach is unique in a few ways. To begin with, the company is using a “pelletized” sorbent — CEO John Pimental described it to me as a “half a piece of uncooked rice,” or the innards of a bean bag chair. The tiny pellets of sorbent flow through the system almost like water, resulting in some operational efficiency gains.
</p><p>
	For the second step, the company plans to use waste heat from other industrial facilities like data centers to remove the captured carbon from the sorbent. Many data centers circulate cold water through their facilities for cooling, then send the hot water to a cooling tower where the heat is released into the atmosphere. 280 Earth can instead take that hot water and run it through a heat exchanger, sending the now-cooled water back to the data center. “It means their cooling tower needs to work less hard, it has less load on it,” said Pimental. “So it's an additional revenue source for our company to provide those cooling services to a neighbor.” <strong><em></em></strong></p><p>This waste heat can meet up to 80% of 280 Earth’s operational needs, reducing the amount of electricity the company buys. It’s also a win-win for the data center — 280 Earth’s process pulls water from the air in addition to carbon, and can supply that water to the data center, which in turn doesn’t have to rely as much on natural sources.</p><p>
	Direct air capture technology is often called “speculative” and “unproven.” But with an increasing number of deployments in the real world, it’s worth being more specific. These machines have proven to be able to separate carbon out of the air. The question is whether they can do so permanently, economically, and at a scale that will actually make a difference for climate change.
</p><p>
	Although more plants are coming online every year, those questions are unlikely to be answered anytime soon. For example, it will be impossible to judge the efficiency claims made by 280 Earth or any other company until there is more public data — or <em><em>any </em></em>public data — about the energy these plants consume or what they cost to operate. Even the companies that are farthest along, like Climeworks, which has been operating a 4,000 metric ton per year commercial plant in Iceland since 2021 and <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/climeworks-mammoth-5-things-to-know" style="" target="_blank">just opened a 36,000-ton plant</a> earlier this month, say that they are still testing the technology and therefore are not ready to share any stats that could be misinterpreted. </p><p>The potential to scale could also have less to do with the details of any one company’s technology and more to do with the ability to procure clean energy or to find somewhere to store the captured carbon. </p><p>
	Though 280 Earth is officially collecting CO2, the company doesn’t yet have anywhere to put it. Pimental told me the company plans to transport the gas by truck or rail to a carbon dioxide storage well, but it has not yet signed any agreements with well operators, and it’s unclear how long that could take. There are currently only a few operating carbon storage wells in the country, located in <a href="https://www.epa.gov/uic/table-epas-draft-and-final-class-vi-well-permits" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Illinois</u></a> and <a href="https://www.dmr.nd.gov/dmr/oilgas/ClassVI" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>North Dakota</u></a>. But additional wells have been permitted in California, Indiana, and Wyoming, and many more are <a href="https://www.epa.gov/uic/current-class-vi-projects-under-review-epa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>under review by the Environmental Protection Agency</u></a>. Rather than sequester the carbon underground, the company could also sell it for industrial uses. Heirloom, for example, has an agreement with a company called CarbonCure to <a href="https://www.heirloomcarbon.com/news/heirloom-carboncure-sign-agreement-to-permanently-store-atmospheric-co2-in-concrete" style="" target="_blank">take the CO2 it captures and store it in concrete</a>.</p><p>
	Regardless, 280 Earth company is aiming to scale up quickly and plans to build a new unit that can capture 5,000 tons of CO2 per year by 2025. Pimental told me that equipment procurement and permitting for that project are already underway. 280 Earth has not been awarded any government funding to date, but the company plans to compete to be one of the Department of Energy’s next direct air capture “hubs.”
</p><p>Pimental told me he likes his odds. “I think we'll be in a very strong position because not many people have a 500 ton commercial demonstration facility up and running.”</p>

## How to Unlock Super Cheap Rooftop Solar

date: 2024-05-22, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjI3OTY1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NzI2Nzk2MH0.kSglAbZDmLUESe5nBAuSBdR8RR_fuZTTCzREfMFTF1k/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Why isn’t rooftop solar cheaper in America? In Australia in 2024, a standard rooftop system can cost as little as 90 cents per watt. In the U.S., a similar system might go for $4 per watt. If America could come even close to Australia’s rooftop solar prices, then we would be able to decarbonize the power system much faster than we are now.
</p><p>
	Mary Powell has the answers. She is the chief executive officer of 
	<a href="https://www.sunrun.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Sunrun</u></a>, a $2.6 billion company that is the country’s largest rooftop solar and battery installer. Sunrun has set up or managed more than 900,000 rooftop systems across the U.S. Powell previously led Green Mountain Power, Vermont’s largest investor-owned power company.
</p><p>
	On this week’s episode of Shift Key — a continuation, of sorts, to one of our 
	<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-five-rooftop-solar" target="_blank">most popular early episodes</a> — Rob and Jesse talk about how the rooftop solar business works and what’s driving America’s higher costs. Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap, and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at Princeton University.

	Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p><blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins:</strong> And so, just some stats to start off the conversation. The latest quarterly solar update from the Department of Energy notes that the average cost of a 2 to 10 kilowatt residential rooftop system in the U.S. is roughly $4 per watt, DC, installed. That’s the full installed system costs, not just the modules.<br/>
<br/>
	I just looked up 
	<a href="https://www.solarchoice.net.au/" target="_blank">solarchoice.net.au</a>, the Australian site that tracks bids and costs in Australia, which has one of the most vibrant rooftop solar industries in the country. There, you can now install a rooftop solar system in Sydney for just under $1 U.S. per watt, which is quite remarkable — you know, dramatically cheaper than it was a few years ago, but also dramatically cheaper than the U.S residential solar market, by a factor of four. <br/>
<br/>
	And so obviously, if we could knock the cost of rooftop solar in the U.S. down by another 75%, it would be an incredible value proposition all over the country. So, how do we get there, Mary? What explains why solar in the U.S., rooftop solar, is much more expensive than it is in places like Australia — I should say, it’s not just Australia. It’s also, you know, the U.K. and Germany and Belgium and other places. Why is it so much more expensive here now than it is in these other countries? And how do we drive down the cost of residential solar installations in the U.S. so that we can unlock that potential here, too?
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Mary Powell: </strong>Yeah, for sure. I mean, that is so exciting when you think about it, Jesse. What gets me so excited when you say that is I think, ‘<em>Oh my gosh, we are selling all across America now with savings against what people are paying for utility power.’ </em> So customers — even at our current costs. So back to your question on how I see the future, just think about how powerful that will be as we continue to innovate and figure out ways to drive down the cost.<br/>
<br/>
	Now, that said, the biggest driver of the cost difference is the way the American energy system is built. And not just that, but we have 40,000 AHJs in the United States that each have their own distinct solar process and rules. And in Australia they have fewer than 600.
	<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer:</strong> And those are like cities?<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Powell:</strong> It’s housing jurisdictions. It’s like — let me give you an example. In DuPage County, Illinois, we have to have a full time employee pull permits all day. Only one permit at a time. <br/>
<br/>
	You know, the other big thing in the U.S. is our whole energy system, as we know, it is very much driven by state and regional rules. Like rules of the road, a lot of regulatory differences from one jurisdiction to another, a lot of massive differences from one utility to another. So, you know, interconnection for residential is still costly, time consuming, and is even prohibited in some areas. Interconnection fees for home solar systems from utilities range from $100 to $10,000. So, one of the bright spots is the work that Sunrun was involved in, a lot of players were involved in, and that Secretary Jennifer Granholm is really focused on, which is SolarAPP+. So, that is one way to drive down the cost, Jesse. 
	<br/>
<br/>
	Back to the difference: So really, I would say, the biggest difference is bureaucracy. When you talk about Australia and you talk about the U.S., that’s the biggest difference.

## May 21, 2024* 

date: 2024-05-22, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

Trump&#8217;s lawyers rested their defense of the former president today, putting an end to the testimony we will hear in the case. Trump did not testify. Trump's refusal to take the stand encapsulates the MAGA approach to politics. Since the 2020 presidential election, he and his surrogates have made repeated accusations and statements about how the system is rigged against them and alleged there is evidence that proves them right.

## Habari! White House to welcome Kenyan president

date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA

The White House — The White House gave three reasons for inviting Kenyan President William Ruto on Thursday to break the 16-year drought during which no African leader has been honored with a pomp-filled state visit.


Those include the two governments' shared democratic convictions and their like-minded approach in leveraging the private sector to meet government aims.


But the primary reason, the administration's new top Africa policymaker told VOA, is Kenya's recent decision to assert itself globally by offering 1,000 peacekeepers for Haiti. The first tranche of boots on the ground are expected to hit Haitian soil this week.




"We chose Kenya for a few reasons," Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, told VOA during her first media interview since taking the post. "No. 1 is the Kenya-U.S. partnership has really grown from a regionally focused one to a globally focused one. We've been really pleased by the way that Kenyans have stepped up to play leadership [roles] beyond their region."


Analysts say a state visit is a big deal.


"It is the highest diplomatic honor that our president can bestow," said Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.


"It's typically an indicator of a very close and important bilateral relationship. And so, elevating Kenya to the level of, let's say, a Japan, which was the most recent country to have a state visit, I think it is symbolic. And it's important for all the reasons that I just described as far as Kenya being on a level that we would give it the same privileges as one of our oldest and longest security partners,” Hudson said.




Brown said the administration aims to use the visit to reach agreements in areas like technology, climate management, debt relief and health.


And on the Haiti mission, Washington has signaled its approval: with $300 million in support.


"We've been working really closely with them," Brown said. "As you may know, there's been planning underway for a number of months. It has included policing experts from around the world working to develop a concept of operations. Kenya is not going it alone."


Other priorities 


Meanwhile, the Kenyan leader says his focus is on debt restructuring, and activists in the East African nation are sounding the alarm over human rights concerns.


Ruto, in Atlanta for his first stop of his four-day U.S. visit, said he'd use his time in Washington to "make a case for many countries in Africa, including Kenya, seeking to adjust international financial architecture."


"Many countries are in economic and debt distress occasioned by climate change and compounded by an unjust international financial architecture and also an imperfect multilateralism," he said.


"We now run the escalating risk of democracy and free markets being associated with poverty, and lending credit to the widespread lamentation that democracy is or has been on the retreat in many parts of the world, including Africa,” Ruto added.


But human rights advocates in Nairobi told VOA they hope American leadership will also raise what they see as serious concerns, like reports of abuses by Kenyan police, who are taking the lead in the Haiti mission.


"We see this as a really excellent opportunity to focus on governance, human rights and rule of law, for many reasons," Irungu Houghton, executive director for Amnesty International Kenya, told VOA. "Both the United States and Kenya are nations that projected themselves as essentially, nations that believe in these values, and the state dinner is an opportunity really to focus on that."


Others highlight a tightening of public expression, especially over the hot-button issue of the Gaza war. Many African nations have criticized Israel's behavior in the conflict, but Kenya's government has kept largely quiet.


"Especially within the Muslim community in Kenya, we've had persons trying to protest them and to picket on this issue, but they had a very, very hard time having access to the streets, because every time they go out, the police arrest them," said Demas Kiprono, who leads the Kenyan section of the International Commission of Jurists.


Others say they hope American leadership will voice concerns over a pending Kenyan law that they say targets sexual minorities.


"It's criminalizing things even like pronouns. It's criminalizing things like using [gender] neutral toilets. It's a horrible, horrible law that is being financed by Family Watch International — that's the same organization that financed the Uganda bill and all the (LGBTQ)-related bills basically in Africa and even in the U.S.," said activist and organizer Yvonne Muthoni.


Family Watch International is a conservative Christian American lobbying group. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremist groups, says it “works within the United Nations and with countries around the world to further anti-LGBT and anti-choice stances.”


"We are looking at violence that is coming from this. Whether it's online or physical violence, we are seeing a rise in the number of cases that are being reported, in the number of complaints, in the rallies that are being called for. So, it is quite a scary time for Kenya right now," Muthoni said.


The view from here and there


At the White House this week, a large Kenyan flag was displayed alongside an American flag, each covering the height of an entire story of the hulking gray Eisenhower Executive Building. Workers erected massive white sails around the White House's North Portico, where the Bidens plan to formally welcome the Rutos.


Meanwhile, the day after Ruto departed Nairobi — likely traversing the new Chinese-built superhighway that cuts the city in half and ends at the airport — one had to scroll far down on news to find mention of his American jaunt.


Instead, the nation's prominent newspapers focused on issues that Kenyans wrestle with daily. The Standard's front page wrote of 850,000 new jobs last year — close to the 900,000 the World Bank says is needed to sustain economic growth in the lower middle-income country.


That coverage mirrors Kenyans' priorities, Houghton said.


"Most Kenyans are economically distressed," he said. "They are very concerned about the cost of living. Thousands of them went onto the streets last year and almost rendered the country ungovernable in certain counties because they felt that the crippling number of taxes that had been introduced were essentially not making it possible for them to survive. We've seen a deterioration in terms of the services, education, health and otherwise. ... So, there is a very clear disproportionate, I guess, energy around this visit."


Farhad Pouladi contributed to this report from the White House.

## Blinken: Gaza cease-fire still possible, but ICC's move complicates efforts

date: 2024-05-22, from: VOA News USA

state department — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas militants in return for the release of hostages remains possible, but the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants for Israeli leaders hindered ongoing efforts.  


"There's been an extensive effort made in recent months to get that agreement. I think we came very, very close on a couple of occasions. Qatar, Egypt, others participating in the efforts to do this — we remain at it every single day. I think that there's still a possibility," Blinken told lawmakers during a hearing at the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.    


But Blinken said the "extremely wrongheaded decision" by the ICC prosecutor to seek arrest warrants for Israel's prime minister, defense minister and three Hamas leaders in Gaza for war crimes and crimes against humanity in connection with the Israel-Hamas war complicated the prospects of reaching such a deal.    


On Monday, U.S. President Joe Biden denounced the ICC prosecutor's decision to equate Hamas terror attacks and civilian abductions in southern Israel with Israel's military practices in Gaza, calling the ICC prosecutor's application for arrest warrants "outrageous."  


Blinken said he will be happy to work with the Congress "on an appropriate response."    


Some lawmakers are considering legislation to sanction ICC officials for prosecuting U.S. citizens or allies, including Israel.  


The top U.S. diplomat began two days of congressional testimonies, which were immediately interrupted by protesters holding signs that read "war criminal." They were escorted out of the hearing room by Capitol Police.  


Military operation in Rafah   


In the nearly three-hour hearing, Blinken also said the Biden administration remains "very concerned" about a major military operation by Israel in Rafah.  


The U.S. has opposed a full-scale military assault by Israel in Rafah, situated in the southern part of Gaza. Such an operation would endanger the lives of 1.3 million civilians who evacuated from the northern and central areas of the territory to seek safety from Israel's military response to Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel.  


Israel's military campaign has killed more than 35,000 Palestinians and wounded nearly 80,000, most of them civilians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The offensive was launched following a Hamas terror attack into Israel that killed 1,200 people.  


US-Saudi defense pact     


U.S. officials said the United States and Saudi Arabia are nearing a final agreement on a bilateral defense pact.   


Once complete, it will be part of a broader deal presented to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who must decide whether to make concessions to his opposition regarding the establishment of a Palestinian state to secure normalization with Saudi Arabia.  


On Tuesday, Blinken admitted that Israel might be reluctant to accept a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia if it requires them to agree to a Palestinian state.    


In his testimony before the U.S. Congress, Blinken told Democratic Senator Chris Murphy "the overall package could not go forward, absent other things that have to happen for normalization to proceed."


"And in particular," he said, "the Saudis have been very clear that would require calm in Gaza. And it would require a credible pathway to a Palestinian state. And it may well be, as you said, that in this moment, Israel is not able or willing to proceed down that pathway."    


Blinken added that Israel must "decide whether it wants to proceed and take advantage of the opportunity" to achieve something that it has sought since its founding: normal relations with the countries in the region.  


Netanyahu has rejected the two-state solution and the return of the Palestinian Authority controlling Gaza, demands that are widely supported by the international community.  


The Saudis have demanded, as a prerequisite to normalizing ties with Israel, to see an Israeli commitment to the two-state solution.

## How to make Google’s new “Web” search option the default in your browser

date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News

Last week, Google unveiled a new little feature in Google Search, called &#8220;Web&#8221;. Residing alongside the various other options like &#8220;All&#8221;, &#8220;Images&#8221;, &#8220;Video&#8221;, and so on, its goal is to effectively strip Google Search results from everything we generally don&#8217;t like, and just present a list of actual links to actual websites. It turns out it&#8217;s quite simple to set this as your default search &#8220;engine&#8221; in your browser, so somebody made a website to make that process a little easier. On May 15th Google released a new &#8220;Web&#8221; filter that removes &#8220;AI Overview&#8221; and other clutter, leaving only traditional web results. Here is how you can set &#8220;Google Web&#8221; as your default search engine. ↫ TenBlueLinks.org It&#8217;s important to note that this is not some separate search engine, and that no data is flowing any differently than when using regular Google. All this does is append the parameter UDM=14 to the URL, which loads the option &#8220;Web&#8221;.

## ProPublica’s new “50 states” commitment builds on a decade-plus of local news partnerships

<p>"It’s a good time to be ProPublica. And it’s a good thing that we have ProPublica." </p>

<p>Hey, that's where I work!</p>

<p>The article continues:</p>

<p>"Spreading its journalistic wealth has long been core to its mission. The latest iteration of that is the 50 State Initiative, announced last month."</p>

<p>The 50 State Initiative is a commitment to publishing accountability journalism in every US state over the next five years. This is an expansion of the Local Reporting Network, which was already doing great work in partnership with local newsrooms. As this piece points out, there are actually only two states where ProPublica hasn't run some kind of an investigative story - but, of course, the 50 States Initiative goes much deeper than that. It's an exciting time to be working here.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Media" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Media</a></p>

## Decentralized Systems Will Be Necessary To Stop Google From Putting The Web Into Managed Decline

date: 2024-05-21, from: Ben Werdmuller's blog

    <div class="known-bookmark">
                <div class="e-content">

<p>"The various decentralized social media systems that have been growing over the past few years offer a very different potential approach: one in which you get to build the experience you want, rather than the one a giant company wants."</p>

<p>There's a chicken and egg problem here: while decentralized systems are absolutely going to be part of the solution, or at least hold most of the properties that make for a good solution, they also need to have a critical mass of people who use them.</p>

<p>A lot of people are looking towards Threads to provide this critical mass, but just as I'd invite newsrooms to consider how to gain more traffic without Apple News, I'd invite the federated social web community to consider what a growth looks like without Meta. It's not that Threads won't help - it's that you don't want to be dependent on a megacorp to provide the assistance you need. You never know when they'll change their policies and look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Still, the point stands: decentralization is a key part of the answer. There's a lot to be gained from investing in projects that provide strong user experiences, solve concrete real human problems alongside the ideological ones and the existential threats, and onboard a new generation of internet users to a better way to share and browse.</p>

<p>That's a tall order, but, as always, I'm hopeful.  <a href="https://werd.io/tag/Technology" class="p-category" rel="tag">#Technology</a></p>

## Biden Has Already Lost the Climate Debate to Trump

Weekly <em><em>Economist</em></em>/YouGov polls conducted online since last April <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2024/04/10/who-are-the-swing-voters-in-america" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>show</u></a> that of the 49,000 voters who responded, just 3% of respondents voted for one candidate in 2020 and plan to vote for the other in 2024. (Of those swing voters, two-thirds have flipped to Trump.) The 2024 election is already so politically calcified that a night of persuasive television is unlikely to change additional minds, to say nothing of two hours of petty sniping. Although, the only thing more difficult than changing someone’s mind about Biden or Trump might be changing their mind about climate change — a similarly key facet of political identity, regardless of the facts.</p><p>Nothing has the potential to highlight both the spectacle and the farce of this whole election quite like a back-and-forth on the debate stage over Biden’s climate legacy. Trump has spent the past several months on the campaign trail hammering his opponent on <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-climate-change" target="_self"><u>everything</u></a> from offshore wind to electric vehicles, dishwashers, and gas stoves. The bashing has little to do with the actual <em><em>policies</em></em>, but rather with the idea of climate policy itself. </p><p>The modern Republican Party has “managed to define almost all aspects of environmentalism — even just future concern for other people’s welfare — as not a virtue anymore but a sign of weakness,” Riley Dunlap, a professor emeritus of environmental sociology at Oklahoma State University, put it to me. Heatmap columnist Paul Waldman <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-lab-grown-meat" target="_self"><u>recently dubbed</u></a> this kind of political positioning “anti-anti-climate change” — not in favor environmental degradation <em>per se</em>, but certainly against anyone trying to stop it. Trump is merely an exemplar of a greater shift on the right — traceable also to Wyoming Senator <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-republican-biden-gas-stove-ban" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>John Barrasso</u></a>, Wisconsin Senator <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ron-johnson-suggested-windmills-are-killing-whales-rcna104335" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ron Johnson</u></a>, and on down to dozens of state attorneys general suing to roll back the Biden administration’s climate policies — moving “the conversation from the real problem onto the supposedly oppressive efforts to solve it.”</p><p>It’s a phenomenon I’ve observed, too, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/2024-election-climate-trump" target="_self"><u>in my writing</u></a> about how Republicans have evolved from the <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/the-surreal-success-of-professional-climate-denial" target="_self"><u>denial and skepticism strategies</u></a> of the 1990s and early 2000s to today’s more underhanded tactics. Why bother getting hung up on the specifics of what is causing global warming or if it’s happening (especially when popular belief in the scientific consensus <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/climate-change-support" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is at an all-time high</u></a>) when you can focus on how the elites in Washington want to control how you drive, eat, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/republicans-weave-a-climate-conspiracy-at-the-final-debate" target="_self"><u>invest</u></a>, and cook, instead?</p><p>Jay Turner, a professor of environmental studies at Wellesley College and the author of <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/95482/9780674979970" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>The Republican Reversal: Conservatives and the Environment from Nixon to Trump</em></em></u></a>, told me the politicization of climate change has been building for more than a decade. He traced the strategy back to around the 2010 midterms, when the populist, anti-government Tea Party movement — today mostly remembered for opposition to Obama-era federal healthcare reforms — <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/climate-of-doubt/transcript/?" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also took aim at climate change</u></a>. With the <a href="https://www.savannahnow.com/story/news/2008/06/19/balloon-tour-condemns-global-warming-solution/13354153007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>backing</u></a> of the libertarian advocacy group Americans for Prosperity (funded by petrochemical billionaires Charles and David Koch), the movement helped <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/26/science/earth/26climate.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>kill</u></a> the bipartisan cap-and-trade Waxman-Markey Bill, which up to that point had been the biggest climate bill ever to pass a chamber of Congress. </p><p>“A culture of freedom and abundance is something that is very American,” Turner told me. “The idea that we’re going to curb fossil fuels or are transitioning our economy because of an abstract environmental threat” runs counter to what many feel the flag stands for.</p><p>Republicans, especially those angling for a national audience, have found traction with voters exploiting this perceived threat. The general public isn’t terribly energy literate, so politicians “can kind of make up stuff like, ‘They’re going to make you use these terrible toilets, they’re gonna force you to get an electric car, they’re going to force you just start eating fake meat,’” Dunlap, the Oklahoma State professor, said. “The message is, ‘These people are out to get you, and we’re fighting for you.’”</p><p>This dialog presents a problem for Biden, who has not only enacted <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-biden-administration-has-taken-more-climate-action-than-any-other-in-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>numerous climate policies</u></a>, but who also now faces the daunting task of <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/inflation-reduction-act-popularity-repeal" target="_self"><u>explaining to voters</u></a> what all of them are. But by opening a second, substantively unrelated front in the climate conversation, Trump and other Republicans have wrenched the message away from liberal-coded ideas that are, in fact, <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/bidens-climate-agenda-is-actually-popular" target="_self"><u>popular</u></a> across a broad spectrum of voters and toward more solid conservative ground. </p><p>“Most Republican voters still want clean air and clean water and a healthy climate,” is how David Pomerantz, the executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute, a utilities watchdog, put it to me. “But if they’re able to cast this messaging in ways that are anti-government, anti-elitist, and anti-somebody-telling-you-what-you-have-to-do, then they think that can be an effective strategy.”</p><p>It’s working. As Biden has paused approving construction permits for new liquefied natural gas export terminals (which is also <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lng-front-line-communities-louisiana" target="_self"><u>a clean-air issue</u></a>) and argued for diversifying American energy (<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/alaska-natural-gas-anchorage-mayor" target="_self"><u>an economic one</u></a>), Republicans have doubled down on their anti-anti-climate bona fides. “I don’t know if this is an actual term anyone uses, but it might be more accurate to say they are ‘vice signaling’ because it’s like, ‘Yeah, we’re for the bad thing because it’s a way to own the libs,’” Pomerantz said. There is often a healthy amount of irony in these sorts of controversies, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ crusade against gas stoves that are <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/only-8-of-floridians-have-gas-stoves-but-desantis-promises-to-fight-potential-ban/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTake%20away%20gas%20stoves%2C%20take,going%20to%20let%20that%20happen.%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>used by less than 10% of Floridians</u></a>, or a ban on <a href="https://heatmap.news/lifestyle/lab-grown-meat-florida-desantis" target="_self"><u>lab-grown meat</u></a>, which isn’t even available in the U.S.</p><p>The “obvious and boring” thing for Biden, his team, and others to do in the face of such bluster is “to just say the true thing over and over,” Pomerantz went on. But he also noted that climate advocates like EPI must make clear “not only when people are lying or purveying disinformation, but <em><em>why</em></em>.” If Trump hits Biden over energy or drilling, for example, the president could counter by raising Trump’s recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/climate/trump-oil-gas-mar-a-lago.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>closed-door dealings with oil executives</u></a>, in which he used fossil-fuel regulations intended to keep Americans healthy as a bargaining chip for soliciting campaign donations. But that kind of move is only possible after your opponent has set the pieces on the board — and if your opponent is disingenuous, as likely as not, you’ll have lost by the time you get started.</p><p>If there is any good news, it’s that the presidential debate itself won’t matter. Whatever Trump and Biden say about climate next month won’t change the minds of any of the few dozen people (OK fine, actually more like 63 million, based on the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-virus-outbreak-health-ad254c08bc2dfbcbbaf258cace153fa9" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>audience</u></a> of their last matchup, in 2020) likely to tune in.</p><p>The bad news is that Biden has already lost the climate debate, even if Trump renews his distinction of setting “the tone for the worst presidential debate in living memory,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-and-biden-stage-the-worst-presidential-debate-in-living-memory/2020/09/29/9cdbeb56-027e-11eb-b7ed-141dd88560ea_story.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as he did the last time around</u></a>. Because by arguing foolish premises, Biden legitimizes them. And he may have no other choice.</p>

## My blogging workflow

date: 2024-05-21, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p><a href="https://birming.com/posts/our-blogging-workflow">Robert</a> told me about this blogging workflow trend that’s currently happening in a bunch of blogs around the web and since I thought it’s a neat idea I’m gonna share mine.</p>
<p>I’m gonna split it into two because this blog serves as both my home on the web as well as a home for the <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs series</a>.</p>
<h2>My posts</h2>
<p>I have two types of posts on this site: regular blog posts and “moments”. Moments are my personal Instagram, posts with an image and a short caption. As the name suggests, those are moments in time and so there is no real planning behind them. This is how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>I take a picture with my iPhone</li>
<li>I do some light editing using Snapseed</li>
<li>I log into my site’s dashboard</li>
<li>I create a new post</li>
<li>I write a title that always starts with “A moment...”</li>
<li>I upload the picture and I write the short post directly on the admin interface</li>
<li>I hit save</li>
</ol>
<p>There’s no proofreading involved, no drafts, no nothing. I take a photo, I upload it, write something and move on with my day.</p>
<p>As for the regular posts, those are handled a bit differently. My blog has no structure behind its schedule. I post about whatever I find interesting at any point in time. I have a to-do list with a bunch of random ideas that usually appear in my head out of nowhere when I’m outside for a walk. Those entries in my to-do are either a single line—for example <em>Taxonomy of personal websites</em>—or a combination of title + short description—<em>Good conversations: What’s the ideal workflow for a good conversation online</em>.</p>
<p>When I feel in the mood to post something I either pick one of those entries or, like I’m doing now, I write about something else, usually in response to something I read somewhere else. The workflow is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>I open iA Writer </li>
<li>I write my post</li>
<li>When I feel I’m done I copy-paste into Grammarly to check for typos or other silly issues</li>
<li>I open my site’s dashboard</li>
<li>I create a new post</li>
<li>I copy-paste from Grammarly and I hit publish</li>
<li>I then log into Buttondown.email, create a new email, paste the content of the new post and hit send because there are some 100 or so people who want to get my posts via email</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, I don’t do drafts, don’t do editing. I have an idea, I write it down, check for silly issues with Grammarly and then I post it online. That’s how my blog works.</p>
<h2>People and Blogs</h2>
<p>As I mentioned before, my site also hosts the People and Blogs interviews. The workflow for those posts is a bit different and it goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have a list of potential guests on Airtable</li>
<li>I cold email a bunch of people and ask if they want to be part of the series</li>
<li>If they say yes I send them the questions</li>
<li>When I get back the answers I create a new post</li>
<li>I format their answers in markdown and add the intro and outro and store it as a draft</li>
<li>On the week the interview is scheduled to go live I send a link to the draft to the guest to give them time to do a final check and to also give them a final chance to add or remove anything from the answers</li>
<li>Once the interview is good to go I log into the Buttondown account, create the interview and schedule it to go live on Friday</li>
<li>5 minutes before it’s time to go live a reminder rings on my phone to make sure I don’t forget to publish the post</li>
<li>I log into my dashboard and hit publish</li>
</ol>
<p>And that’s how it works for P&amp;B. Could I add an auto-publish feature on my site? Sure. Would that save me time? Maybe 20 seconds a week. Is it worth it? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>And those are my workflows. Nothing fancy, very few tools and very little automation. As always if you have questions you can <a href="mailto:hello@manuelmoreale.com">ping me via email</a> and if you haven’t already go subscribe to <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">People and Blogs</a>!</p>                <hr>

## noTunes: a macOS application to prevent iTunes or Apple Music from launching

date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News

noTunes is a macOS application that will prevent iTunes or Apple Music from launching. Simply launch the noTunes app and iTunes/Music will no longer be able to launch. For example, when bluetooth headphones reconnect. You can toggle the apps functionality via the menu bar icon with a simple left click. ↫ noTunes GitHub page Apparently, this is such a common complaint that an application had to be made just to gain some semblance of control over what some people still refer to as &#8220;their&#8221; computer. For both macOS and Windows, there&#8217;s a giant industry &#8211; you can&#8217;t really call it a cottage industry anymore at this point &#8211; of tools, applications, and fixes just to deal with or avoid all the user-hostile, anti-choice garbage Apple and Microsoft shove into their respective operating systems. As a Linux user &#8211; and recent OpenBSD convert &#8211; I find this absolutely wild. Following any Apple podcast, or reading any Windows website, makes it so clear just how many hoops these people have to jump through and how many weirdly-shaped holes they have to contort into just to be able to gain some vague semblance of ownership of their own hardware. I&#8217;m not judging &#8211; we all have areas in our lives where we do this, they just differ from person to person &#8211; but it&#8217;s still confronting to see it so clearly, all the time.

## Rudy Giuliani pleads not guilty to felony charges in Arizona election interference case

date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA

Phoenix, Arizona — Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani pleaded not guilty Tuesday to nine felony charges stemming from his role in an effort to overturn Donald Trump's 2020 election loss in Arizona to Joe Biden.


Giuliani appeared remotely for the arraignment that was held in a Phoenix courtroom. His trial will take place in October.


Former Arizona Republican Party chair Kelli Ward and at least 11 other people were also arraigned Tuesday for conspiracy, forgery and fraud charges in a Phoenix courtroom. She and nine others have so far pleaded not guilty. Her trial date is set for Oct. 17, about 3 weeks before the U.S. election.


During his remote appearance, Giuliani said he did not have an attorney at this time but will. When asked by the court whether he needed counsel appointed for the arraignment, Giuliani said: "No, no, I think I am capable of handling it myself."


Giuliani said he received a summons but did not have a copy of the indictment. He said he is familiar with the charges, though, by reading about them.


Arizona authorities tried unsuccessfully over several weeks to serve Giuliani notice of the indictment against him. Giuliani was finally served Friday night as he was walking to a car after his 80th birthday celebration in Florida.


On Tuesday, in response to the prosecutors request for a $10,000 cash bond after outlining the difficulty in serving Giuliani in the case, Giuliani said: "I have a fair number of threats including death threats, and I don't have security anymore ...so I have very strict rules about who gets up and who doesn't."


The judge required Giuliani to post a secured appearance bond of $10,000 as well as appear in Arizona within the next 30 days for booking procedures.


Arizona authorities unveiled the felony charges last month against Republicans who submitted a document to Congress falsely declaring Trump, a Republican, had won Arizona. The defendants include five lawyers connected to the former president and two former Trump aides. Biden, a Democrat, won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.


The indictment alleges Ward, a former state senator who led the GOP in Arizona from 2019 until early 2023, organized the fake electors and urged then-Vice President Mike Pence to declare them to be the state's true electors. It says Ward failed to withdraw her vote as a fake elector even though no legal challenges changed the outcome of the presidential race in Arizona.


Last week, attorney John Eastman, who devised a strategy to try to persuade Congress not to certify the election, was the first defendant in the case to be arraigned, pleading not guilty to the charges.


Trump himself was not charged in the Arizona case but was referred to as an unindicted co-conspirator.


Arizona is the fourth state where allies of the former president have been charged with using false or unproven claims about voter fraud related to the election.


The 11 people who claimed to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were "duly elected and qualified" electors and asserting that Trump carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored.


Of eight lawsuits that unsuccessfully challenged Biden's victory in the state, one was filed by the 11 fake Arizona electors, who had asked a federal judge to decertify the results and block the state from sending its results to the Electoral College. In dismissing the case, the judge concluded the Republicans had "failed to provide the court with factual support for their extraordinary claims." Days after that lawsuit was dismissed, the 11 participated in the certificate signing.


Those set to be arraigned Tuesday are Ward; Tyler Bowyer, an executive of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA; state Sen. Anthony Kern; Greg Safsten, a former executive director of the Arizona Republican Party; Robert Montgomery, a former chairman of the Cochise County Republican Committee; Samuel Moorhead, a Republican precinct committee member in Gila County; Nancy Cottle, who in 2020 was the first vice president of the Arizona Federation of Republican Women; Loraine Pellegrino, past president of the Ahwatukee Republican Women; Michael Ward, an osteopathic physician who is married to Ward; attorneys Jenna Ellis and Christina Bobb; and Michael Roman, who was Trump's 2020 director of Election Day operations.


Arraignments are scheduled for June 6 for state Sen. Jake Hoffman; on June 7 for former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows; and on June 18 for Trump attorney Boris Epshteyn and for James Lamon, another Republican who claimed Trump carried the state.

## Biden releasing 1 million barrels of gasoline from Northeast reserve in bid to lower prices at pump

date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration said Tuesday that it is releasing 1 million barrels of gasoline from a Northeast reserve established after Superstorm Sandy in a bid to lower prices at the pump this summer. 


The sale, from storage sites in New Jersey and Maine, will be allocated in increments of 100,000 barrels at a time. The approach will create a competitive bidding process that ensures gasoline can flow into local retailers ahead of the July 4 holiday and sold at competitive prices, the Energy Department said. The move is intended to help "lower costs for American families and consumers," the department said in a statement. 


Gas prices average about $3.60 per gallon nationwide as of Tuesday, up 6 cents from a year ago, according to AAA (American Automobile Association). Tapping gasoline reserves is one of the few actions a president can take by himself to try to control inflation, an election year liability for the party in control of the White House. 


"The Biden-Harris administration is laser-focused on lowering prices at the pump for American families, especially as drivers hit the road for summer driving season," Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in the statement. "By strategically releasing this reserve in between Memorial Day and July 4th, we are ensuring sufficient supply flows to the tri-state (area) and Northeast at a time hardworking Americans need it the most." 


White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said release of gas from the Northeast reserve builds on actions by President Joe Biden, a Democrat, "to lower gas and energy costs — including historic releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the largest-ever investment in clean energy." 


Biden significantly drained the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, dropping the stockpile to its lowest level since the 1980s. The election-year move helped stabilize gasoline prices that had been rising in the wake of the war in Europe but drew complaints from Republicans that the Democratic president was playing politics with a reserve meant for national emergencies.

## Scarlett Johansson says she is ‘shocked, angered’ over new ChatGPT voice

date: 2024-05-21, from: OS News

Lawyers for Scarlett Johansson are demanding that OpenAI disclose how it developed an AI personal assistant voice that the actress says sounds uncannily similar to her own. Johansson&#8217;s legal team has sent OpenAI two letters asking the company to detail the process by which it developed a voice the tech company dubbed &#8220;Sky,&#8221; Johansson&#8217;s publicist told NPR in a revelation that has not been previously reported. ↫ Bobby Allyn at NPR This story highlights just how much disdain techbros have for the work of creative people. Here&#8217;s the timeline: Techbros like Sam Altman deeply despise and undervalue the work of creatives, believing human creativity to be merely an equation to be solved, definable by an algorithm. To people like him, creative work has no value, and as such, is up for grabs to be taken and cut up for his algorithms to spit out as &#8220;new&#8221; works. This story highlights this perfectly. The sleaze runs deep with Altman and OpenAI.

## In Houston, storm damage recovery and insurance hurdles

date: 2024-05-21, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Houston residents are once again rebuilding after a severe windstorm delivered damage to cars, businesses and homes last week. Insurers are just beginning to assess the extent of the damage — at a time when insurance is getting pricier and harder to find. Then, the FDIC&#8217;s chair says he will step down once a successor is confirmed following investigations into toxic culture at the agency. Plus, can legislation save local news?</p>

But that changed last year when EVs took the top spot, using 7,596 GWh. The EIA notes this is nearly five times the amount of electricity EVs consumed in 2018. The numbers underscore two trends: the limited expansion of U.S. rail, and the explosive growth of EV sales.

## US expects South Korea and Japan to manage ties with China at summit amid growing differences

date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Ahead of a trilateral summit involving South Korea, Japan, and China this weekend in Seoul, Washington said it expects the event to be an opportunity for its two allies to manage their relations with Beijing.


“The United States respects the ability of nations to make sovereign decisions in the best interests of their people,” said a spokesperson for the State Department.


“Just as the United States takes steps to responsibly manage our relationship with the PRC, so do our partners and allies,” the spokesperson continued in an email to VOA’s Korean Service on May 15. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is China’s official name.




The summit would come amid a heightened tension between Washington and Beijing over trade  and after China agreed with Russia to establish a “new era” partnership to create “a multipolar world order” during their summit last week.


The three East Asian countries are expected to hold their summit from May 26 to 27, but the official dates have not been announced. Chinese Premier Li Qiang is expected to attend in place of Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.


The meeting would be their first trilateral summit since December 2019.


Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on May 14 that Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul should be main drivers responsible for regional stability and security.


Pointing out what Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said after a trilateral foreign ministers meeting in November, Pengyu said the three countries need to “address differences and disputes in peaceful ways” and “act as front runner of East Asia cooperation.”


Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing are planning to discuss trade and investment, peace and security, and science and technology, among other items and include in a joint statement their cooperation on economic issues and infectious diseases, according to the Japan Times, citing Japanese government sources Sunday.


Former U.S. officials said while it will be important for the three countries to meet and talk at the summit, differences that Seoul and Tokyo have with Beijing on North Korea are unlikely to be resolved.


“With China determined to establish a new China-centric regional order and because of Beijing’s open-ended support for the DPRK, we should not expect progress on this issue,” said Evans Revere, a State Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea.


North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).


“Nevertheless, it is important for South Korea and Japan to use this summit to convey their strong concerns,” Revere continued.


At a bilateral summit last week, Beijing and Moscow criticized Washington and its allies for their “intimidation in the military sphere” against North Korea.




 


Zhao Leji, who ranks third in the Chinese Communist Party, visited Pyongyang in April and agreed with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to boost cooperation on mutual concerns. It was the highest-level talks the two countries had held in years.


The upcoming summit comes after trilateral cooperation was agreed among Washington, Seoul and Tokyo at their Camp David summit in August 2023 to strengthen their deterrence against North Korean threats and to defend a free and open Indo-Pacific against Chinese aggressions.


Joseph DeTrani, who served as the U.S. special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said, “China will ask that the ROK and Japan not to align with the U.S. against China, an issue that wasn’t on the table in 2019.”


South Korea’s official name is the Republic of Korea (ROK).


DeTrani said Seoul and Tokyo will “try to get China to convince North Korea to cease providing arms to Russia for its war in Ukraine” and “to use its leverage” with Pyongyang “to halt ballistic missile launches.”




Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of Kim Jong Un, denied Pyongyang’s arms dealings with Moscow, according to state-run KCNA on Friday. The same day, North Korea launched a tactical ballistic missile, said KCNA. 


Gary Samore, who served as the White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said the summit will become “an opportunity for communication” among Seoul, Tokyo and Beijing to avoid conflict, but the differences that grew among them since 2019 will not be resolved as South Korea and Japan “leaned in the direction of cooperating with the U.S.”

There is a curious dynamic at work in politics these days. Trump does not appear to be trying to court voters to his standard. If he were, he would be reaching out to Nikki Haley voters and trying to moderate his stances. Instead, he is rejecting her voters and doubling down on extreme positions. Rather than trying to appeal to swing voters, he seems to be trying to whip up his right-wing base to engage in violence on his behalf.

## Why the Biden White House chose Kenya for its first state visit by an African leader

date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA

The White House — The White House says it chose Kenya for its first state visit by an African leader for many reasons — not least because the East African powerhouse has stepped up on the global stage, offering to staff a United Nations peacekeeping mission to Haiti that could see boots on the ground as early as this week.


VOA White House correspondent Anita Powell sat down with Frances Brown, the newly appointed director for African affairs at the National Security Council, ahead of a state visit by Kenyan President William Ruto. They discussed a range of issues, including technology, climate management, debt relief, democracy, health and more.


The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.


VOA: In a few days, President Joe Biden hosts Kenyan President William Ruto at the White House, his first African leader for a state visit. Why was Kenya chosen and what deliverables can we expect?


Frances Brown, NSC director for African affairs: We chose Kenya for a few reasons. No. 1 is the Kenya-U.S. partnership has really grown from a regionally focused one to a globally focused one. ... and we see a lot of complementarities in terms of what we're trying to do on climate. What we're trying to do on debt for the developing world, and on security issues.




The second reason we wanted to have this state visit with Kenya is that we are both democracies, and our bond is very deep as democracies, and our bond is very deep on people-to-people ties.


The third reason is that Kenya and the U.S. really work similarly in terms of bringing in the private sector to solve global challenges. So, we'll be talking a lot about those. The deliverables you'll see are in the realms of technology, clean energy and climate transition, of debt relief, of democracy, of people-to-people ties and on health-related issues.


VOA: Kenya hopes to soon have peacekeepers in Haiti. Why is this so important to the administration?


Brown: We do really welcome the Kenyans raising their hand to help lead this multinational security support mission in Haiti, because it's kind of an example of what I just mentioned of Kenya raising its hand to solve problems even outside of its region. ... As you may know, there's been planning under way for a number of months. It has included policing experts from around the world working to develop a concept of operations. Kenya is not going it alone. The U.S. has provided $300 million towards this, so it's a big thing for us.


VOA: Are there any other security agreements these two countries might come up with during the state visit?


Brown: I would say watch this space, because I think security cooperation with Kenya is a really important plank.


VOA: Is it going to be focused on threats from Somalia or from other parts of East Africa?


Brown: The U.S. and Kenya have long cooperated on Somalia. I think you can look for security-related announcements that go beyond that.


VOA: U.S. troops are pulling out of the Sahel and the so-called “Coup Belt.” What are the concerns the administration has about security in the Sahel region, especially as Russia expands its footprint there?


Brown: As has been widely reported, we are making an orderly withdrawal from Niger. I will say that is pretty consistent with our administration’s [counterterrorism] posture in general that we have made changes to our posture that are consistent with our CT policy. It is no secret that democracy is on the backfoot in a lot of places globally.


If you talk to democracy scholars, democracy is on something like its 20th year of global decline. So, Africa is not alone in this regard. The Biden administration is focused on lifting up and partnering with democracies to help them deliver.


You may have seen USAID’s initiative on democracy delivering. We're working with a few African countries on that. And I think this is, again, something that we'll be talking a lot to the Kenyans with, because President Ruto has talked about the imperative of democracy delivering.


VOA: Regarding issues of trade and the African Growth and Opportunity Act — obviously, this is going to be a decision made by Congress, but how does the administration feel about the benefits of trade and of barrier-free trade with the United States?


Brown: President Biden has been really vocal that he sees AGOA reauthorization and AGOA modernization as a huge priority. It has been huge, I think from our perspective, but also from the perspective of the region. It's something we hear a lot about from our Kenyan partners. We do look to Congress for that. But as you know, reauthorization is due next year, and obviously we hope that things can get in motion before then.


VOA: The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — which has been a literal lifesaver for people around the African continent — is up for renewal next year. How does the White House see this program as contributing to national security?


Brown: We see PEPFAR as essential. And as you know, PEPFAR has been supported with bipartisan congressional support and across administrations since the George W. Bush initiative initially. We think PEPFAR is delivering for people across the continent, and we've been proud to support it, and we look for reauthorization.


VOA: When is President Biden going to visit Africa, and where will he go?


Brown: So, I cannot make news at this moment by announcing presidential travel. But what I will say is thus far, I think President Biden's commitment to the relationship with the continent is pretty clear. If you think about Kenya, it's the first state visit that we're giving to a non-G20 country this term. There's only been five other state visits. ... But then you just look at the steady stream of Cabinet official travels to the continent over the past two years — by our count, there's 24 principals or Cabinet-level officials who've made that trip, all of them bringing their own agenda.


I'd also say just in terms of the other ways President Biden has shown his commitment, advocating for AU [African Union] membership with the G20 has been huge. Advocating for more African seats and international financial institutions and all the other transformative investment.


VOA: You’ve just joined the NSC in this capacity. What priorities do you bring to this post?


Brown: I think I see this post as moving forward on the affirmative agenda that President Biden laid out first, and the Sub-Saharan Africa Strategy, which was published at the end of 2021. Then the African Leaders Summit, which came at the end of 2022. There were a lot of initiatives launched by those two events. Now we are running forward on implementation.


At the same time, of course, at the NSC, the urgent sometimes competes with the important, so of course, we're seized with managing crises. And we're really sobered by the crises that are happening in many parts of the continent. So, I see my role as a balance between those two, and I'm thrilled to be on board.

## US officials warn cyberattacks on water systems are increasing

EPA did not say how many cyber incidents have occurred in recent years, and the number of attacks known to be successful so far is few. The agency has issued nearly 100 enforcement actions since 2020 regarding risk assessments and emergency response, but said that's a small snapshot of the threats water systems face.

## Head of US deposit insurance agency to step down

date: 2024-05-21, from: VOA News USA

new york — The White House said Monday that the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation would step down, a departure that will follow the release this month of a damning report about the agency’s toxic workplace culture.


The White House said Martin Gruenberg would step down once a successor was appointed and that President Joe Biden would name a replacement “soon." The announcement came after the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee earlier Monday called for Gruenberg's removal.


Biden expects the FDIC "to reflect the values of decency and integrity and to protect the rights and dignity of all employees,” deputy press secretary Sam Michel said in a statement.


The FDIC is one of several U.S. banking system regulators. The Great Depression-era agency is best known for running the nation’s deposit insurance program, which insures Americans’ deposits up to $250,000 in case their banks fail.


Before Monday, no Democrats had called for Gruenberg’s ouster, although several came very close to doing so. But Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, who is facing a tough reelection campaign, issued a statement Monday calling for Gruenberg to step down, saying his leadership at the FDIC could no longer be trusted.


Gruenberg was grilled for two days last week on Capitol Hill in hearings largely focused on the FDIC's workplace culture and the failures disclosed in the report prepared by an outside law firm.


"After chairing last week’s hearing, reviewing the independent report and receiving further outreach from FDIC employees ... , I am left with one conclusion: There must be fundamental changes at the FDIC,” Brown said in a statement.


Republicans have been calling for Gruenberg's ouster for some time and criticized the White House for not calling for his immediate departure.


Gruenberg has held various leadership positions at the FDIC for nearly 20 years, and this was his second full term as FDIC chair. His long tenure at the agency made him largely responsible for the agency's toxic work environment, according to the report outlining the problems at the agency.


The report released last Tuesday by law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton cites incidents of stalking, harassment, homophobia and other violations of employment regulations, based on more than 500 complaints from employees.


Among the complaints: a woman said she was stalked by a coworker and continually harassed even after complaining about his behavior; a field office supervisor referred to gay men as “little girls”; and a female field examiner  described receiving a picture of an FDIC senior examiner’s private parts.

## Pentagon vows to keep resupplying Ukraine with weapons

date: 2024-05-21, from: San Jose Mercury News

The U.S. announced no new aid packages Monday, even as Ukrainian forces continue to complain that weapons are just trickling into the country after being stalled for months due to congressional gridlock over funding. Pentagon officials have said that weapons pre-positioned in Europe began moving into Ukraine soon after the aid funding was approved in late April.

## GHC release plans

date: 2024-05-21, from: Glasgow Haskell Compiler

<h1>GHC release plans</h1>
<h4 class="text-muted">Zubin Duggal - 2024-05-21</h4>

<p>This post sets out our plans for upcoming releases in the next few months.</p>
<p>Given limited time and resources, we plan to prioritise work on the 9.6, 9.10
and master branches of GHC for the next few months.</p>
<h2 id="section">9.10</h2>
<p>With the release of 9.10.1, we look forward to the broader adoption of this release.</p>
<p>New releases in this series will continue at the usual rate depending on if and
when any significant regressions or issues arise.</p>
<h2 id="section-1">9.6</h2>
<p>9.6.5 seems to be a relatively stable release so far and we plan to prioritise
fixes given the relatively higher adoption of this branch. We know of one
significant issue (<a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/22210">#22210</a>) to do with object merging arising from the
interactions between GHC and cabal on certain platforms including Darwin with a
<code>brew</code>-provisioned clang toolchain.</p>
<p>The upcoming 9.6.6 release will include a fix for this issue along with others
that may arise. The 9.6.6 release is tentatively scheduled for the end of June,
to allow for sufficient time following the 9.6.5 release for bugs and issues to be
reported and addressed.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">9.8</h2>
<p>We plan to continue supporting this release series for the near future,
but updates to this series might proceed at a slower rate than usual as we
prioritise the new release (9.10) and supporting earlier releases with high
uptake (9.6).</p>
<p>The next release in this series will likely be scheduled after the 9.6.6 release.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We hope that this clarfies the current state of our release branches.
If you have any questions or comments then please be in touch via
<a href="mailto:ghc-devs@haskell.org" class="uri">mailto:ghc-devs@haskell.org</a>.</p>
