id="holocaust-survivors-mark-hanukkah-amid-worries-of-israel-hamas-war-antisemitism">Holocaust
Survivors Mark Hanukkah Amid Worries of Israel-Hamas War,
Antisemitism</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Holocaust survivors from around the globe will mark the start of the
fifth day of Hanukkah together with a virtual ceremony as Jews worldwide
worry about the Israel-Hamas war and a spike of antisemitism in Europe,
the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Survivors can join an online ceremony of a menorah lighting Monday
night to pay tribute to the 6 million European Jews killed by the Nazis
in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Several dozen survivors were also expected to gather in-person for a
menorah lighting at Jerusalem’s Western Wall — the holiest place where
Jews can pray.</p>
<p>“Holocaust survivors somehow overcame the depravity of concentration
camps, death camps and killing centers, among other horrors, to become
our living exemplars, providing a roadmap on how light can overcome
darkness,” Greg Schneider, the executive vice president of the
Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, said in remarks
released to The Associated Press ahead of the ceremony.</p>
<p>The New York-based conference is organizing the event in observance
of International Holocaust Survivors Night.</p>
<p>“Their resilience, their strength and their fortitude leave a truly
indelible light in this world,” Schneider added.</p>
<p>Hanukkah, also known as Judaism’s festival of lights, marks the
rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century B.C., after a
small group of Jewish fighters known as the Maccabees liberated it from
occupying Syrian forces.</p>
<p>This year’s holiday comes as many Jews feel traumatized by Hamas’
deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and in which the
militants took some 240 as hostages. Israel responded with a bombing
campaign and a ground offensive that has so far killed more than 18,000
people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run territory’s Health Ministry.
The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant
deaths.</p>
<p>Several celebrities and world leaders spoke about the attack in
messages that were to be shown at the ceremony. German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz said “Hamas’ terrorist attack on Israel has affected us all
deeply. Something of abyssal evil broke free that day,” according to
comments released to the AP.</p>
<p>“The perpetrators’ motive is clear: They wanted to hit Israel,” the
chancellor added. “They wanted to murder Jews. In its repugnant
brutality and abhorrence, however, the terror is also directed against
humanity itself.”</p>
<p>Scholz, addressing Holocaust survivors, said he tries “to imagine how
much the images from Israel, how much antisemitic hatred on the internet
and on the streets around the world must be hitting you, of all people
right in the heart.”</p>
<p>“This … pains me a lot,” he said.</p>
<p>The virtual event, which starts at 8 p.m. Monday in Germany, will
also include musical performances, celebrity guests and messages from
Holocaust survivors from around the globe.</p>
<p>Leon Weintraub, a Holocaust survivor from Sweden, who was in Israel
during the Hamas attack, recounted what he experienced that day.</p>
<p>“On Oct. 7, I woke up from the sirens in the center of Tel Aviv. All
at once I was again in September 1939 when the Nazis invaded Poland,” he
said. “A terrible feeling, a shiver, a feeling of dread to be again in a
war.”</p>
<p>“We celebrate Chanukah now, the festival of lights. I hope that the
light will also bring the people enlightenment,” Weintraub added. “That
people will rethink and look at us people of Jewish descent as normal,
equal. Human beings.”</p>
<p>American comedian Billy Crystal, actress Jamie Lee Curtis and actor
Jason Alexander will also speak at the event, and there will also be a
by a musical performance from Grammy and Tony Award-winning singer Barry
Manilow, as well as the cast of Harmony.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: OS News</p>
<p>Today, Apple pushed out the public releases of iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2,
macOS Sonoma 14.2, watchOS 10.2, and tvOS 17.2. iOS 17.2 and iPadOS
17.2’s flagship feature is the new Journal app, which Apple teased when
it first introduced iOS 17 earlier. The app mimics several existing
popular journaling apps in the App Store from third-party developers but
leverages data from your Photos, workouts, and other Apple apps to make
journaling suggestions. Other features include the ability to tap a
“catch-up arrow” to scroll to the first missed message in a conversation
in Messages, the ability to take spatial video photos for later viewing
on Vision Pro, and several tweaks and additions to the Weather app. ↫
Samuel Axon for Ars Technica Makers of journalling applications for iOS
are not going to be in a good mood today, I reckon.</p>

id="harvard-faces-pressure-to-respond-to-presidents-congressional-testimony">Harvard
Faces Pressure to Respond to President’s Congressional Testimony</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Harvard University’s governing board faced mounting pressure on
Monday to publicly declare support for or oust the university president
after remarks she made last week at a congressional hearing on
antisemitism.</p>
<p>The Harvard Corporation, the university’s governing body, has not yet
addressed the public backlash Harvard President Claudine Gay received
after her testimony. </p>
<p>Prominent alumni and members of Congress have called for her to
resign as her fellow Ivy League leader at University of Pennsylvania,
who also testified to Congress last week, did on Saturday. But many
faculty and other alumni have rushed to defend Gay and asked the
governing body to do the same.</p>
<p>The 13-member governing body was due to hold a regular meeting on
Monday, according to media reports. A representative for Harvard did not
respond to a request for comment. </p>
<p>Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has donated millions
to Harvard, wrote in an open letter to Harvard’s board on Sunday that
Gay had “quelched speech she disfavors while defending and thereby
amplifying vile and threatening hate speech.” </p>
<p>A petition urging her removal claimed over 1,100 alumni signatures as
of midday Monday.</p>
<p>But the Harvard Alumni Association Executive Committee on Monday
asked the Harvard Corporation to back Gay, the Harvard Crimson reported.
Nearly 700 faculty members signed a petition supporting Gay as of Monday
afternoon, while Black alumni and allies said on social media that they
had gathered nearly 800 signatures on another petition supporting the
president. </p>
<p>At a hearing before a U.S. House of Representatives committee on
Tuesday, three university presidents — Gay, Liz Magill of Penn and Sally
Kornbluth of Massachusetts Institute of Technology — declined to answer
“yes” or “no” when asked if calling for the genocide of Jews would
violate school codes of conduct regarding bullying and harassment.</p>
<p>The trio said they had to take free speech into consideration. Gay on
Thursday apologized for her remarks at the hearing in an interview with
Harvard’s student newspaper. </p>
<p>The hearing increased public outcry over how U.S. colleges are
handling campus protests since Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel. Jewish
communities have claimed universities are tolerating antisemitism.
Pro-Palestinian groups have accused the schools of being neutral or
antagonistic toward their cause.</p>
<p>On Friday, 74 members of Congress, in a letter to the boards of all
three schools, called for leadership changes. </p>
<p>Magill and the University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees chair
Scott Bok resigned from their posts on Saturday. The Executive Committee
of the MIT Corporation said in a statement after Kornbluth’s testimony
that she still had its full support.</p>
<p>Free speech debate</p>
<p>Many on the political right have accused the university presidents of
hypocrisy, saying they defended free speech at the congressional hearing
but police speech when it offends causes they prefer. </p>
<p>At the hearing, Republican lawmakers grilled the presidents over
their schools’ diversity efforts and accused them of being inhospitable
to conservative viewpoints.</p>
<p>Ackman also called for closing Harvard’s office of diversity, equity,
inclusion and belonging, and alleged that the committee that appointed
Gay, a Black woman, to the presidency had discriminated against “non-DEI
eligible candidates.”</p>
<p>Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton said Ackman’s letter was a
further assault on efforts to expand inclusion months after the Supreme
Court, in a case that involved Harvard, struck down race-conscious
college admissions programs.</p>
<p>At other U.S. universities, teachers have been suspended or banned
from campus as the debate over violence in the Middle East roils. The
University of Arizona on Dec. 1 reinstated two educators who were
suspended in November.</p>
<p>The University of Southern California on Dec. 2 lifted restrictions
on an economics professor who last month was directed to teach
online.</p>

<h2 id="house-to-vote-on-formalizing-biden-impeachment-inquiry">House to
Vote on Formalizing Biden Impeachment Inquiry</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. House Republicans are progressing toward a vote this week that
would formalize the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Joe
Biden. But whether leadership has enough votes to approve the measure
remains unclear.</p>
<p>Polling released Monday morning indicated that a small plurality of
Americans thought the inquiry should move forward, but that even among
self-identified Republicans, enthusiasm for the inquiry was
slipping.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted by the polling firm Morning Consult, found that
44% of Americans thought the inquiry should move forward, compared to
40% who said it should not. The results broke heavily along partisan
lines, with 62% of Democrats saying the inquiry should not proceed while
70% of Republicans saying it should. A plurality of independents, 47%,
said the inquiry should not continue, with only 37% saying it
should.</p>
<p>The data showed that Americans on the whole are less enthusiastic
about the inquiry than they were. Monday’s overall 44% approval of the
inquiry was down from 47% in September. Similarly among Republicans, the
percentage in favor of a continued investigation fell from 76% to 70%
over the same time period.</p>
<p>GOP balancing act</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, a president can be involuntarily removed from office
outside a normal election cycle only if he is convicted by the Senate of
“treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” An impeachment
inquiry is the first step in a process that can lead to impeachment
proceedings in the House and, if they are successful, a trial in the
Senate.</p>
<p>While impeachments are historically rare, Americans have significant
recent experience with them. Former President Donald Trump was impeached
twice during his term in office. In 2019, he was impeached for
pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to launch an
investigation into Biden, then seen as a likely rival to Trump in the
2020 presidential election.</p>
<p>He was impeached a second time in 2021, after his attempts to
overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election resulted in the
January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. In both cases, Trump was
acquitted in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required to
convict.</p>
<p>With House Democrats expected to unanimously oppose the measure,
Republicans will need to find the votes in their own ranks to pass it.
They hold 221 seats in the House, where there are currently 434 members,
meaning that if the party loses more than three votes, the measure will
fail.</p>
<p>Currently, eyes are on the more than a dozen Republican House members
who represent districts that Biden won in the 2020 election, and who
might suffer politically if they cast an unpopular vote in favor of
impeachment.</p>
<p>Previous vote avoided</p>
<p>It was out of concern about these members that former House Speaker
Kevin McCarthy allowed the House Committee on Oversight and
Investigations to begin inquiries into the impeachment of the president
earlier this year.</p>
<p>In the interim, several Republicans representing Biden districts have
come out in favor of formalizing the inquiry. However, not all have
expressed a position on the measure coming up for a vote this week.</p>
<p>Last week, Speaker Mike Johnson, who took over after McCarthy was
voted out in October, told The New York Times he was confident he had
the necessary votes.</p>
<p>“This is a vote to continue the inquiry of impeachment, and that’s a
necessary constitutional step. I believe we’ll get every vote that we
have,” he said.</p>
<p>The Republican House contingent, however, has been difficult to
predict in this Congress, as Johnson’s predecessor learned.</p>
<p>More authority for investigators</p>
<p>The vote would strengthen the hand of Republican Representative James
Comer, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability,
who has been leading the inquiry since early this year when his party
took control of the House. Among other things, it would allow him to
compel witnesses to testify, by subpoena if necessary.</p>
<p>So far, the investigation has delved deeply into the finances of
Biden and members of his extended family, including his son Hunter, who
was indicted on criminal tax evasion charges last week.</p>
<p>However, House investigators have complained that Biden and his
family have not been fully cooperative in turning over evidence and
arranging testimony. The committee is threatening to hold Hunter Biden
in contempt because he has said that while he is willing to testify
publicly, he is unwilling to submit to a closed-door deposition.</p>
<p>Lack of evidence</p>
<p>The committee has so far gathered considerable evidence that Hunter
Biden and other members of the president’s family traded on their famous
name to help secure favorable business deals, often with foreign
companies.</p>
<p>Committee members have more than once presented evidence that they
claimed proved President Biden derived personal financial benefits from
his relatives’ business activities. But in each case, the evidence has
not held up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>Most recently, Comer said a series of payments from Hunter Biden’s
company to the president’s personal account made in 2018 — while the
elder Biden was out of office — proved that he had benefited from his
son’s business activities. It was later disclosed that the payments
represented reimbursement for car loan payments that Joe Biden had made
on his son’s behalf.</p>
<p>President Biden has consistently denied that he ever used his office
to enrich himself and has criticized the impeachment investigation as
being politically motivated and without basis in facts.</p>

id="supreme-court-asked-to-decide-if-trump-is-immune-from-prosecution">Supreme
Court Asked to Decide if Trump Is Immune From Prosecution</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>U.S. special counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court on Monday to
quickly consider whether former President Donald Trump has any immunity
from charges accusing him of illegally conspiring to upend his 2020
election loss to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>In an effort to keep Trump’s scheduled March 4 trial date in
Washington on track, Smith asked the country’s highest court to uphold
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan’s ruling that the case can go forward,
and bypass Trump’s appeal of her ruling to the federal appellate court
in Washington, a process that could take months.</p>
<p>“The United States recognizes that this is an extraordinary request,”
Smith told the Supreme Court. “This is an extraordinary case.”</p>
<p>Hours later, the Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments from both
sides about whether they should act quickly to decide whether Trump has
immunity from being charged criminally. Trump’s lawyers were told to
file briefs on the issue by December 20.</p>
<p>By asking the Supreme Court for direct consideration of whether Trump
is immune from prosecution for actions he took while still in office in
the waning days of his presidency in late 2020 and early 2021, Smith is
trying to avert having the trial delayed until after next November’s
presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump is the overwhelming favorite for the 2024 Republican
presidential nomination even as he faces an unprecedented four criminal
indictments accusing him of 91 offenses, all of which he has denied.</p>
<p>If he were to win the White House again and any federal trials had
yet to occur, he could direct his attorney general to drop two cases
brought by Smith — the election conspiracy case and another in the
Southern state of Florida set for May accusing him of mishandling
classified documents as he left office.</p>
<p>Trump appointed three of the nine sitting Supreme Court justices
during his four years in office. But the former president does not have
a winning track record at the high court.</p>
<p>The justices rejected requests from Trump and his supporters to get
involved in challenges to the 2020 election results. They also ruled
against his claims that the presidency protected him from investigation
and turned back his efforts to block release of his financial
records.</p>
<p>In asking the Supreme Court to rule on whether Trump is immune from
prosecution, prosecutors wrote, “This case presents a fundamental
question at the heart of our democracy: whether a former president is
absolutely immune from federal prosecution for crimes committed while in
office or is constitutionally protected from federal prosecution when he
has been impeached but not convicted before the criminal proceedings
begin.”</p>
<p>The prosecutors emphasized the urgency of the matter to the Supreme
Court, saying, “It is of imperative public importance that [Trump’s]
claims of immunity be resolved by this court and that [his] trial
proceed as promptly as possible if his claim of immunity is
rejected.”</p>
<p>The prosecutors told the high court that Trump’s immunity claims “are
profoundly mistaken, as the district court held. But only this court can
definitively resolve them.”</p>
<p>Chutkan, the trial judge in the case, rejected arguments by Trump’s
attorneys that he was immune from federal prosecution. In her order, she
wrote that the office of the president “does not confer a lifelong
‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass.”</p>
<p>“Former presidents enjoy no special conditions on their federal
criminal liability,” Chutkan wrote. “Defendant may be subject to federal
investigation, indictment, prosecution, conviction and punishment for
any criminal acts undertaken while in office.”</p>
<p>Trump, a Republican, is accused in a four-count indictment in
Washington of conspiring to upend the results of the 2020 election he
lost to Biden, a Democrat who is running for reelection next year.</p>
<p>The indictment alleged that Trump sought “to overturn the legitimate
results of the 2020 presidential election by using knowingly false
claims of election fraud to obstruct the federal government function by
which those results are collected, counted and certified.”</p>
<p>On January 6, 2021, as Congress met to officially certify the results
of the Electoral College showing Biden had won, Trump urged supporters
to march to the U.S. Capitol and “fight like hell” to disrupt the
proceeding. In the ensuing mayhem, about 2,000 Trump supporters stormed
into the Capitol, clashed with police and rampaged through some
congressional offices.</p>
<p>More than 1,100 protesters were arrested and more than 600 have been
convicted of an array of offenses.</p>
<p>After hours of delay, Congress ratified Biden’s victory in the early
hours of January 7, and he became the country’s president on January 20,
2021.</p>

<h1>
Bots, again
</h1>
<p>
I come home from a friendly meetup and notice that my tiny web-server
has a load of 80 instead of the usual 0.5. What the hell is going on? I
look at the logs of the last 24 hours and see an IP number with more
than 100 000 hits in the last 24h. What are they doing?
</p>
<p>
Whois tells me it is from the “Alibaba Cloud”. Oh yeah? What are the
Chinese trying to do on my site?
</p>
<p>
I start poking around. More and more IP numbers from all over the net
show up. Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud.
</p>
<p>
All right, so I’m blocking some of them individually as I go, but after
a while I realize that I probably have to block them at the network
level.
</p>
<p>
For the moment I’m also taking down one of the wikis that’s overloading
my server.
</p>
<p>
Just looking at the top 10 offenders for two of my domains, and running
whois on them to find the entire network they belong to, and checking
that it’s Alibaba or Tencent:
</p>
<pre><code># Alibaba Cloud 2023-12-10
RewriteCond &quot;%{REMOTE_ADDR}&quot; &quot;-R '47.76.0.0/14'&quot; [or]

RewriteRule ^ https://alexschroeder.ch/nobots [redirect=410,last]
</code></pre>
<p>
If I want this to be for the entire server and not repeat it for each
location, I guess I’ll have to use Apache rewrite rules.
</p>
<p>
While I’m doing this, I notice a new pattern… My wiki software allows
you to fetch a feed for every page. Either it contains updates to the
page (Oddmuse), or a feed of the pages linked (Oddmu). It’s for humans.
</p>
<p>
Of course some shit engineer decided that it was a good idea to scan the
web for all the feeds that are out there (so rare! so precious!) and to
download them all, forever (uncover the darknet! server our customers!)
and now I have to block IP number ranges, add robot agents to robots.txt
files (not all of them provide one), or block user agents (not all of
them provide a useful one) and I block and block and block (for the
environment! to avoid +2.0°C and the end of human civilization!) and all
this while I know that all these shit requests exist out there, for all
the sites, everywhere – a hundred thousand requests or more per day, per
site, wasting CO₂ – and what am I going to do, kill the feeds for humans
because some shit engineer decided to feed a machine?
</p>
<p>
I’m on the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)#The_Butlerian_Jihad">Butlerian
Jihad</a> again.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and Virgin Media is downloading tons of PDFs I’m hosting? Are they
looking for copyright violations? On the blocklist they go.
</p>
<p>
And what’s this, Feedly is also downloading feeds like crazy, every few
minutes? Slow down, idiots. My news is not important. On the blocklist
they go. Or are you trying to train your stupid intelligence? Fuck this
AI training stuff. I already use “X-Robots-Tag: noimageai” but I guess I
should add even more HTTP headers to block even more engineers
overstepping boundaries?
</p>
<p>
Ah, and MonitoRSS going into overdrive, from the Amazon Cloud. Really, I
don’t think there are humans in the Amazon Cloud. Onto the blocklist
they go. Well, at least this IP range.
</p>
<p>
And who’s that VelenPublicWebCrawler, zealously collecting pages? Onto
the blocklists they go.

id="ukraines-zelenskyy-addresses-us-military-officers-in-washington">Ukraine’s
Zelenskyy Addresses US Military Officers in Washington</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy received a standing ovation
at the National Defense University in Washington Monday after he
addressed U.S. military officers, kicking off a visit to Washington
aimed at persuading Congress to provide more military aid to Ukraine
before funding runs out.</p>
<p>In his speech, Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of defeating
Russia in Ukraine because he said, if Russia wins in Ukraine, Russian
President Vladimir Putin will not stop there.</p>
<p>“His [Putin’s] weapon against you right now is propaganda and
disinformation. But if he sees a chance, he’ll go further,” he said.
“Now he’s shifting Russia’s economy and society on[to’ what he calls
‘war tracks.’”</p>
<p>Zelenskyy said freedom must prevail when challenged and thanked
Americans for the support.</p>
<p>“The whole world is watching us. … Ukraine hasn’t given up and won’t
give up. We know what to do, and you can count on Ukraine. And we hope,
just as much to be able to count on you,” he said.</p>
<p>The Ukrainian president said that, so far, Ukrainian forces have
taken back 50% of the territory they lost to Russia, and he pointed to
the perseverance of Ukrainian “warriors” on the battleground.</p>
<p>“Right now, amid fierce battles, our soldiers are holding positions
on the front and preparing for further actions, and we haven’t let
Russia score any victory this year.” But he stressed “we have to win in
the sky.”</p>
<p>In his remarks at the National Defense University, U.S. Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin maintained that U.S. support in Ukraine is
unshakeable and warned, “If we do not stand up [to] the Kremlin’s
aggression today, if we do not deter other would-be aggressors, we will
only invite more aggression, more bloodshed and more chaos.”</p>
<p>“Now despite his crimes, and despite his isolation, Putin still
believes that he can outlast Ukraine, and that he can outlast America.
But he is wrong,” Austin said.</p>
<p>International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Kristalina Georgieva will
meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on
Monday, an IMF spokesperson said, as the fund’s executive board prepared
to release more funds from the country’s $15.6 billion loan program.</p>
<p>The IMF last month announced a staff-level agreement with Ukraine on
updated economic and financial policies, paving the way for a $900
million disbursement once it is finalized by the board.</p>
<p>At the time, the IMF said the Ukrainian economy continued to show
“remarkable resilience” despite Russia’s invasion in February 2022, with
recent developments pointing to a stronger-than-expected economic
recovery in 2023 and continued growth in 2024.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Zelenskyy is expected to go to Capitol Hill and to meet
with Biden at the White House.</p>
<p>Biden has asked Congress for a $110 billion package of wartime
funding for Ukraine and Israel, along with other national security
priorities. Ukraine would get over $61 billion of the money.</p>
<p>But Republicans in the U.S. Senate have balked at the legislation,
saying major U.S. border security changes are needed.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are asking for the immediate deportation of illegal
migrants, stripping them of a chance to seek U.S. asylum. They have also
called for greatly scaling back Biden administration programs that have
allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the U.S.
lawfully.</p>
<p>The U.S. has already provided Ukraine $111 billion for its fight
against Russia’s 2022 invasion.</p>
<p>Zelenskyy’s visit is intended “to underscore the United States’
unshakeable commitment to supporting the people of Ukraine as they
defend themselves against Russia’s brutal invasion,” the White House
said in a statement Sunday.</p>
<p>The stakes are especially high for Ukraine, Secretary of State Antony
Blinken said during television interviews Sunday, given that “we are
running out of funding” for the Ukrainians.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that 90% of the money that goes to Ukraine’s
assistance is invested in the U.S.</p>
<p>“In terms of the production of materials and munitions and weapons
that go to the Ukrainians, it’s right here, in America,” he said.</p>
<p>Russian submarines</p>
<p>Putin inspected two nuclear submarines, the Krasnoyarsk and Emperor
Alexander III, at the Sevmash shipbuilding yard at the arctic port of
Severodvinsk, in a televised ceremony Monday.</p>
<p>The Emperor Alexander III is part of Russia’s new Borei (Arctic Wind)
class of nuclear submarines, the first new generation Russia has
launched since the Cold War.</p>
<p>Last month, the defense ministry said the vessel had successfully
tested a nuclear-capable Bulava intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>
<p>Security analysts say nuclear arms have assumed a greater importance
in Putin’s thinking and rhetoric since the start of the Ukraine
conflict, where his conventional forces are locked in a grinding war of
attrition with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Polish protests</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a month-long blockade by protesting Polish truck drivers
has been partially lifted at one border crossing between Ukraine and
Poland, Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said on
Facebook Monday.</p>
<p>So far, 15 trucks had passed into Ukraine through the
Yahodyn-Dorohusk crossing while 25 trucks were being cleared to head the
other way toward Poland, said Kubrakov.</p>
<p>Blockades continued to stop traffic on three other crossings.</p>
<p>Polish truckers have been pushing to stop Ukrainian drivers from
getting permit-free access to the EU, accusing their Ukrainian
counterparts of using their permit-free access to undercut prices.</p>
<p>They said the protest had not ended and they were just waiting
temporarily for details of a reported local order against one
stoppage.</p>
<p>The Polish protest, which started in early November, has blocked four
main land routes between the two neighbors, pushed up prices of fuel and
some food items in Ukraine and delayed drone deliveries to Ukrainian
troops fighting invading Russian forces.</p>
<p>Ukraine’s customs service said Monday 1,000 trucks were waiting to
get into Ukraine from Poland and 100 trucks would go in the opposite
direction.</p>
<p>Also, Slovak truckers resumed a partial blockade of the country’s
sole freight road crossing with Ukraine Monday afternoon, the Ukrainian
border service said, while Hungarian haulers are also blocking crossings
to Ukraine to protest Ukrainian truckers’ EU permit-free access to
Hungary.</p>

id="is-risc-v-ready-for-hpc-prime-time-evaluating-the-64-core-sophon-sg2042-risc-v-cpu">Is
RISC-V ready for HPC prime-time: evaluating the 64-core Sophon SG2042
RISC-V CPU</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Sophon SG2042 is the world’s first commodity 64-core RISC-V CPU
for high performance workloads and an important question is whether the
SG2042 has the potential to encourage the HPC community to embrace
RISC-V. In this paper we undertaking a performance exploration of the
SG2042 against existing RISC-V hardware and high performance x86 CPUs in
use by modern supercomputers. Leveraging the RAJAPerf benchmarking
suite, we discover that on average, the SG2042 delivers, per core,
between five and ten times the performance compared to the nearest
widely available RISC-V hardware. We found that, on average, the x86
high performance CPUs under test outperform the SG2042 by between four
and eight times for multi-threaded workloads, although some individual
kernels do perform faster on the SG2042. The result of this work is a
performance study that not only contrasts this new RISC-V CPU against
existing technologies, but furthermore shares performance best practice.
↫ Nick Brown, Maurice Jamieson, Joseph Lee, Paul Wang The Sophon SG2042
is the RISC-V processor found in the Milk-V Pioneer workstation, which
was recently featured on LTT as well, for the video crowd among us.
There’s definitely still a way to go for RISC-V, but the gains over the
past few years are clear, and if this keeps progressing this way, it
won’t be long before RISC-V becomes a valid, competitive
architecture.</p>

<h2 id="dubai-is-a-crappy-place-to-have-a-climate-protest">Dubai Is a
Crappy Place to Have a Climate Protest</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDc0Mjc3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNzAwODY3OH0.l4RPyq9Z-ZWKT3HVqx6bm1xPqHVYnJa6LdGmzAJfjMg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
Political protests are a staple of COP summits. Thousands of climate
activists descend on the event each year to call for stronger global
commitments to building renewables and quitting fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
But at COP28, United Arab Emirates laws restricting speech and banning
most forms of public protest have constrained where and how people can
speak out. Demonstrations are only permitted in areas managed by the UN,
known as the “blue zone,” and have to be approved before they can take
place.
</p>
<p>
“We have to say how loud we’re going to be, what’s going to be written
on the banners. We’re not allowed to name countries and corporations. So
it’s really a very sanitized space,” Lise Masson, an organizer at
Friends of the Earth International,
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/cop28-climate-youth-activists-restrictions-dubai-91fe6d8a712af484b56336cf9b3f8988" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told
the <em>Associated Press</em></a> last week.
</p>
<p>
Pre-approved rallies went on throughout last week. But as negotiations
intensified over the weekend, the demonstrations did, too. Activists
declared Saturday a day of protest, the <em>AP</em> said. A group of
about 25 people called for the release of pro-democracy prisoners staged
what
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/activists-stage-rare-uae-politics-protest-during-cop28-climate-summit-2023-12-09/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em>
called</a> a “very rare” UAE protest, while 500 people urged a ceasefire
in Gaza. That’s not to say those demonstrations were unrestrained,
however. Pro-democracy protesters were not allowed to display detainees’
names, and ceasefire demonstrators were barred from naming Israel or
Hamas.
</p>
<p>
Also on Saturday, a small number of climate activists staged a brief
sit-in at OPEC’s pavilion after the oil cartel allegedly directed its
members to reject any agreement involving phasing out fossil fuels,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/climate/opec-cop28-climate-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The
New York Times</em> reported</a>. And as anger simmered over Monday’s
watered-down global stocktake draft — which
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/cop28-agreement-fossil-fuel-phaseout" target="_self">does
not mention</a> a fossil fuel phase-out — climate activists continued to
chafe against the restrictions on their ability to protest during the
summit’s final hours.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the draft release, a line of silent activists held signs
pushing countries to “hold the line” on the phaseout. One protester,
however, refused to follow the pre-approved plan. Licypriya Kangujam, a
12-year-old climate activist from India, ran onto the stage after the
“hold the line” protest on Monday, shouting and brandishing a sign that
read, “End fossil fuel. Save our planet and our future.” Kangujam was
detained and eventually removed from the summit, according to

<h2
id="discipline-handed-down-for-us-intelligence-discord-leaks">Discipline
Handed Down for US Intelligence ‘Discord Leaks’</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force took disciplinary action against 15 airmen,
charging that a lack of supervision and a failure to take action
contributed to the so-called ‘Discord intelligence leaks’ that rattled
the U.S. intelligence community.</p>
<p>A 21-year-old Air National Guardsman, Jack Teixeira, was arrested
this past April, shortly after the leaks were discovered, and is facing
multiple charges for removing documents from a secured work environment,
and then posting the information or photos for a small group on Discord,
a social media platform popular with gamers.</p>
<p>At the time, a top Pentagon official said the leaks, which revealed
information about Russia’s war in Ukraine and about U.S. allies, posed
“a very serious risk” to national security.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, the Air Force said the commander of Teixeira’s
Air National Guard unit, the 102nd Intelligence Wing, was relieved of
command.</p>
<p>Another 14 individuals where subjected to non-judicial punishment
under the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
<p>The Air Force defended the actions, saying officials in Teixeira’s
unit could have and should have taken action that could have mitigated
the improper disclosure of intelligence.</p>
<p>“Individuals in Teixeira’s unit failed to take proper action after
becoming aware of his intelligence-seeking activities,’ the Air Force
said, citing a report by its inspector general.</p>
<p>“Leadership was not vigilant in inspecting the conduct of all persons
who were placed under their command,” the Air Force said.</p>
<p>The statement also said the intelligence leaks were further enabled
by “inconsistent guidance for reporting security incidents” and
“ineffective processes for administering disciplinary actions.”</p>
<p>“However, the investigation did not find evidence that members of
Teixeira’s supervisory chain were aware of his alleged unauthorized
disclosures,” the Air Force said.</p>
<p>According to the Air Force inspector general, evidence indicated that
members of the 102nd Intelligence Wing had information on at least four
incidents involving questionable activity by Teixeira, and that a
smaller number of individuals “had a more complete picture” of
Teixeira’s activities but “failed to report the full details of these
security concerns/incidents.”</p>
<p>“Had any of these members come forward, security officials would
likely have facilitated restricting systems/facility access and alerted
the appropriate authorities, reducing the length and depth of the
unauthorized and unlawful disclosures by several months,” the report
said.</p>
<p>The inspector general’s report further found that a routine
background check flagged concerns about Teixeira, but that the military
granted him top secret clearance anyway.</p>
<p>Additionally, the report found those concerns were never shared with
Teixeira’s unit.</p>
<p>“The details learned in background checks are not routinely shared
with a member’s unit,” it said.  “Had the unit been made aware of
potential security concerns identified during the clearance adjudication
process, they may have acted more quickly.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon Monday said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has been made
aware of the Air Force’s findings and actions, adding Austin is
confident officials are “taking the necessary steps.”</p>
<p>This past July, the Pentagon released the results of its own review
into the leaks, calling for a tightening of existing security measures. 
But it rejected the need for any sweeping overhaul.</p>
<p>“There was no single point of failure,” a senior defense official
said at the time, speaking to reporters about the review’s findings on
the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“What we see here is we have a growing ecosystem of classified
facilities and a body of personnel who are cleared,” the official said.
“Within that we have opportunities to clarify policy … they are not the
clearest documents always.”</p>
<p>Still, Defense Department officials have taken steps to reduce the
number of people with access to classified information.</p>
<p>According to a 2017 report by the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence, approximately 4 million people have U.S. security
clearances, with 1.3 million cleared to access top secret
information.</p>

Not Just You — High Interest Rates Are Hurting the Planet, Too</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDY5ODIxMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODc1MDY5M30.QwKLvdd-C4RYIhuUqMFBscLwomCbiR3DrDCrdi68d3o/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
New clean energy projects have a lot going for them. For one, building
them has gotten extremely cheap. At the same time, because the wind
blowing and the sun shining are unlimited free resources, operating
costs for a clean energy power plant are also pretty low. That’s the
beauty of a clean energy economy — it reduces our exposure to the price
swings, recessions, political instability, and
<a href="https://www.dezernatzukunft.org/en/fossil-fuel-to-the-fire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">surging
inflation</a> that come with fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that the cure for surging inflation — hiking up interest
rates — is having a big, bad impact on clean energy. Elevated interest
rates directly and disproportionately
<a href="https://medium.com/iipp-blog/can-we-avoid-green-collateral-damage-from-rising-interest-rates-1259ea94c9ea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">raise
costs</a> for clean power projects, throwing a handbrake on the clean
energy transition and its deflationary impacts exactly when we need them
most.
</p>
<p>
Here’s how it happens: Nearly all the costs of clean energy projects are
upfront capital expenditures to cover things like building wind turbines
and installing solar panels. And as anyone with a mortgage or car loan
can tell you, the higher the amount you need to finance up front, the
more you care about your interest rate.
</p>
<p>
By comparison, a fossil fuel power plant will pay as they go for the
fuel they need to operate, meaning they have less to finance. And
there’s the rub — those extra financing costs get passed on to clean
energy consumers. Even if a fossil fuel power plant and a clean energy
power plant have equivalent associated costs, if one has to finance more
of that cost upfront at higher and higher interest rates, it’s going to
be less competitive.
<a href="https://medium.com/iipp-blog/can-we-avoid-green-collateral-damage-from-rising-interest-rates-1259ea94c9ea" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Estimates
suggest</a> that as interest rates rise, the total cost of energy from a
gas power plant might rise 8%, but for a clean energy project the same
cost could rise as much as 47%.
</p>
<p>
That impact is being felt across the developed world — Bloomberg’s clean
energy research division, BNEF, estimates that 60% of the cost increase
for offshore wind is the direct result of rising interest rates — but
the impact in the developing world is even more insidious. In emerging
markets, the financing cost to deploy the exact same technology can be
as much as
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/14/climate-focused-reform-world-bank-could-be-done-year-al-gore#:~:text=Gore%20gave%20an%20example%3A%20%E2%80%9CIf,higher%20than%20for%20OECD%20countries." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">seven
times higher</a>. That’s a big part of the reasoning behind the
International Energy Agency’s estimate that we’ll have a
<a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/scaling-up-private-finance-for-clean-energy-in-emerging-and-developing-economies/executive-summary" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">$2
trillion clean finance gap in emerging and developing economies</a> by
2030.
</p>
<p>
In one respect, however, we are in luck — financial regulators have a
wide variety of tools they could deploy to solve this problem by
creating lower, dual rates for clean energy.
</p>
<p>
One way to do that is to create dedicated central bank programs that
give banks access to cheap credit if they pass it on to sectors of the
economy that align with key industrial policy goals — like, say, solving
climate change. If this kind of facility existed, your local bank could
decide that because you put solar panels on your roof, bought an
electric car, or installed a heat pump, it could offer you a mortgage at
4% instead of today’s 7% rate. Or it could finance an offshore wind
developer’s first projects at below-market rates, helping to make them
competitive in a challenging economic environment.
</p>
<p>
As we all know, however, creating new programs or passing new policies
is hard. Instead, we might want to just make existing lending programs
greener. In the EU, for example,
<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2023/html/ecb.sp231122~e12db02da3.en.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">leaders
at the European Central Bank</a> are considering using existing programs
to
<a href="https://greencentralbanking.com/research/targeting-a-sustainable-recovery-with-green-tltros/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">provide
banks with financing</a> at favorable rates if they use it to support
clean energy.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, here in the U.S., the Fed could reduce
<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/fed-targeted-lending-to-fight-climate-change-by-megan-greene-1-2021-04?barrier=accesspaylog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">discount
window</a> interest rates and adjust
<a href="https://ballsandstrikes.org/legal-culture/supreme-court-climate-here-come-the-fed-baby/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">collateral
policies</a> to incentivize clean energy lending — in other words, it
could set the terms on which banks borrow from the Fed to support green
loans and discourage dirty loans. Intervening this way would incentivize
banks to lend more to clean energy at lower rates.
</p>
<p>
The Fed could also use its emergency powers to create a new program just
to provide clean energy with cheaper capital because of the adverse
impacts of high interest rates. It recently used these powers to create
the Bank Term Funding Program explicitly to mitigate the impact of
higher rates on banks; in “unusual and exigent circumstances” and with
the Department of the Treasury’s approval, it could adopt a new program
to provide similar direct support for clean energy. A
once-in-a-civilization clean energy transition to head off a climate
crisis, underwritten by historic climate legislation whose impact is now
threatened by rising interest rates, would seem to qualify.
</p>
<p>
But wait, there’s more! The Fed, along with its fellow banking
regulators the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, could leverage the new Community
Reinvestment Act regulations to encourage certain clean energy
investments,
<a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2023/nr-ia-2023-117a.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">including</a>
community solar and “microgrid and battery” projects that could help
smooth out power supply to public housing in extreme weather.
</p>
<p>
And of course, it’s not just central banks that can create lower dual
rates for clean energy. Public finance institutions can also play an
instrumental role by using their own lower cost of finance to bring down
the cost of credit. For instance, the EU is providing
<a href="https://twitter.com/WindEurope/status/1716793384273121498" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">financial
support for the wind industry</a> in the form of loan guarantees from
the European Investment Bank. Loan guarantees work by putting the full
credit of the government behind a particular project, thereby giving
lenders more confidence they won’t lose their money, which brings down
the cost of finance.
</p>
<p>
In the U.S.,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding" target="_self">subsidized
loans</a> and guarantees funded by the Inflation Reduction Act and
administered by the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office are
already helping to create dual rates for offshore wind — which, thanks
to new Treasury guidance, can now be
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/offshore-wind-investment-tax-credit-biden" target="_self">extended
to cover associated infrastructure</a> like sub-sea cables. Still,
that’s nowhere near what the Fed could do. Add in the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/inflation-reduction-act-grants-funding" target="_blank">new
green bank</a> capitalized with funding from the IRA that could extend
low-interest loans for everything from electric vehicles to heat pumps
and we’ve got a bevy of tools at our disposal.
</p>
<p>
For those wondering whether this kind of Fed policy could be co-opted to
support everything from defense manufacturing to fossil fuel production,
the answer is that industries always lobby for favorable policy wherever
they can get them. But dual interest rates and targeted lending programs
are common practice around the world, even in free market economies,
with no such terrible consequences. At the end of the day, policy is
just a tool, and it’s up to us to make sure it is used to achieve
society’s goals, not corporate profits.
</p>
<p>
Concern over the impact of rising interest rates on clean energy and the
economy more broadly is hitting a crescendo, and for good reason. This
week the Fed governors will meet to decide whether further rate
increases are still warranted. Most Fed-watchers think this
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-11-21/the-fed-rate-hiking-cycle-is-over-macropolicy-s-hunter-video" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cycle
of rising interest rates is finally over</a>, but there’s no such thing
as a guarantee.
</p>
<p>
More importantly, even if the Fed says “enough,” the reality is that our
currently elevated rates will almost certainly take years to come down.
Meanwhile, we have a rapidly vanishing window of time to reach peak
emissions to stay under the Paris Agreement’s limit of 1.5 degrees
Celsius of temperature rise. That means we need new targeted policy
interventions that bring down the cost of finance to keep the clean
energy transition humming. Unlike climate change, the impact of high
interest rates on clean energy is not a force of nature. It’s one we can
control.

‘Phase-Out’ Is Officially Out</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p>
One of the most exciting and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/cop28-global-stocktake-fossil-fuels-phaseout" target="_self">contentious</a>
questions looming over the COP28 climate summit in Dubai this year has
been whether countries will agree to an historic phase out of fossil
fuels to stave off the worst effects of climate change. With one day
left on the official conference agenda, we may have our answer: No.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/GST_2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">A
new draft of the global stocktake</a> text dropped Monday and it
contains no mention of a fossil fuel phase out or phase down. Instead,
the relevant section of the text now calls for “reducing both
consumption and production of fossil fuels, in a just, orderly and
equitable manner so as to achieve net zero by, before, or around 2050 in
keeping with the science.”
</p>
<p>
That the phase-out language didn’t survive a tense weekend of
negotiations isn’t a huge surprise. Any deal to emerge from the annual
United Nations climate summit must be unanimously supported by all 198
participating nations. Saudi Arabia
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/climate/saudi-arabia-cop28-fossil-fuels.html%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">staunchly
opposed</a> a phase-out, while a handful of powerful oil-producing
countries (including the U.S.) wanted to see specific caveats and
provisions.
</p>
<p>
Strong language on moving past oil and gas was always a long shot, but
some activists and governments are still disappointed. Fossil fuels are
a primary source of planet-warming pollution, which must fall by at
least 45% “to avoid global catastrophe,”
<a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> the UN. New analysis from the International Energy Agency
<a href="https://www.iea.org/news/iea-assessment-of-the-evolving-pledges-at-cop28" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concluded</a>
that the voluntary emissions pledges to come out of COP28 so far are
nowhere near dramatic enough to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius
above pre-industrial levels.
</p>
<p>
“This draft takes a giant step backwards,”
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2023/dec/11/cop28-live-time-to-be-ambitious-says-president-as-summit-enters-final-days?page=with:block-657716738f087d36df057e62#block-657716738f087d36df057e62" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
Teresa Anderson, Global Climate Lead at ActionAid. “It’s staggeringly
empty of any new commitments.” <em>CarbonBrief’</em>s Simon Evans
<a href="https://twitter.com/DrSimEvans/status/1734216992012247456" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">laments</a>
that “hardly any of the verbs in the latest draft global stocktake text
actually ask for action.” Kaisa Kosonen, head of the Greenpeace COP28
delegation,
<a href="https://twitter.com/CANIntl/status/1734217319021154428" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">calls
it “a dog’s dinner.”</a>
</p>
<p>
The new text isn’t entirely toothless, though. “By requiring countries
to reduce their fossil fuel production, it effectively achieves the same
ends as a phase down, without using the contentious language that some
countries would not allow,”
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/live/2023/dec/11/cop28-live-time-to-be-ambitious-says-president-as-summit-enters-final-days#top-of-blog" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">argued</a>
<em>The Guardian</em>’s Fiona Harvey. Past language focusing on fossil
fuel emissions instead of production was considered a sneaky workaround
for countries that want to keep emitting while relying on carbon capture
and storage. So focusing specifically on production could be interpreted
as an attempt at stronger accountability.
</p>
<p>
“It appears to be a compromise between Saudi Arabia who didn’t want any
mention of fossils and the progressive countries who called for an
outright fossil fuel phase out,”
<a href="https://twitter.com/James_BG/status/1734216777574334635/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>
Mohamed Adow, Director of Power Shift Africa. “It’s in the middle and
uses creative language to describe the direction of travel.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not sufficient,”
<a href="https://twitter.com/James_BG/status/1734204281996091880" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conceded</a>
<em>BusinessGreen</em>’s James Murray. “But the signal to investors and
businesses is pretty clear. Is it enough to secure backing from COP’s
opposing factions?”

Selection Begins in Election Workers’ Defamation Damages Trial Against
Rudy Giuliani</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Jury selection got underway on Monday in the federal case that will
determine how how much Rudy Giuliani might have to pay two Georgia
election workers he falsely accused of fraud while pushing Donald
Trump’s baseless claims after the 2020 election.</p>
<p>The former New York City mayor has already been found liable in the
defamation lawsuit brought by Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea
“Shaye” Moss, who endured threats and harassment after they became the
target of a conspiracy theory spread by Trump and his allies. The only
issue to be determined at the trial is the amount of damages, if any,
Giuliani must pay.</p>
<p>Giuliani did not speak to reporters as he entered Washington’s
federal courthouse — the same building where Trump is set to stand trial
in March on criminal charges accusing the former president of scheming
to overturn his loss to President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The defamation case is among many legal and financial woes mounting
for Giuliani, who was celebrated as “America’s mayor” in the aftermath
of the 9/11 terrorist attack and became one of the most ardent promoters
of Trump’s election lies.</p>
<p>Giuliani is also criminally charged alongside Trump and others in the
Georgia case accusing them of trying to illegally overturn the results
of the election in the state. Giuliani has pleaded not guilty and
maintains he had every right to raise questions about what he believed
to be election fraud.</p>
<p>He was sued in September by a former lawyer who alleged Giuliani only
paid a fraction of roughly $1.6 million in legal fees stemming from
investigations into his efforts to keep Trump in the White House. And
the judge overseeing the election workers’ lawsuit has already ordered
Giuliani and his business entities to pay tens of thousands of dollars
in attorneys’ fees.</p>
<p>Overseeing the defamation case is District Judge Beryl Howell, who is
well-versed in handling matters related to Trump, having served as chief
judge of Washington’s federal court for the entirety of Trump’s
presidency.</p>
<p>In that role, the appointee of former President Barack Obama has made
several significant rulings, including determining in 2020 that the
House of Representatives was entitled to secret grand jury testimony
from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation and, more recently,
issuing a sealed opinion requiring a lawyer for Trump to testify before
the grand jury over his objections in an investigation into the
mishandling of classified documents.</p>
<p>Moss had worked for the Fulton County elections department since 2012
and supervised the absentee ballot operation during the 2020 election.
Freeman was a temporary election worker, verifying signatures on
absentee ballots and preparing them to be counted and processed.</p>
<p>Giuliani and other Trump allies seized on surveillance footage to
push a conspiracy theory that the election workers pulled fraudulent
ballots out of suitcases. The claims were quickly debunked by Georgia
election officials, who found no improper counting of ballots.</p>
<p>The women have said the false claims led to a barrage of violent
threats and harassment that at one point led Freeman to leave her home
for more than two months. In emotional testimony before the U.S. House
Committee that investigated the U.S. Capitol attack, Moss recounted
receiving an onslaught of threatening and racist messages.</p>
<p>In an August decision holding Giuliani liable in the case, Howell
said the Trump adviser gave “only lip service” to complying with his
legal obligations and had failed to turn over information requested by
the mother and daughter. The judge in October said that Giuliani had
flagrantly disregarded an order to provide documents concerning his
personal and business assets. She said that jurors deciding the amount
of damages would be told they must infer that Giuliani was intentionally
trying to hide financial documents in the hopes of “artificially
deflating his net worth.”</p>
<p>Giuliani conceded in July that he made public comments falsely
claiming Freeman and Moss committed fraud while counting ballots at
State Farm Arena in Atlanta. But Giuliani argued that the statements
were protected by the First Amendment.</p>

<h1>
I bought a keyboard
</h1>
<p>
I was at the <a href="https://swissmk.ch/">Swiss Mechanical Keyboard</a>
Meetup. I wanted to get rid of my keyboards and instead I bought one. 😓
</p>
<p>

<p>
This is the keyboard I bought from Sam:
</p>
<p>
<img loading="lazy" src="2023-12-10-keyboards-5.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p>
It is labelled as
<a href="https://www.monsgeek.com/product/m6/">Monsgeek M6</a>, KTT
Matcha, GMK DMG Clones.
</p>
<p>
Right now my fingers are confused and seemed to expect the Atreus layout
I had been using recently, at least as far as the thumbs go.
</p>
<p>
I get the feeling that not all keys work as intended, though. The right
Ctrl key <del>has no effect</del> is a layer switch that enables &lt;
and &gt; to control the volume, for example. The left Alt key is GUI.
The right Alt key <del>has no effect</del> had a bent pin on their
switch. The App key <del>has no effect</del> had a bent pin on their
switch. The App key is actually Alt. The ] and = keys <del>have no
effect</del> had a bent pin on their switches. The Volume Up key is
mapped to Delete. The Volume Down key is mapped to Prior. The Mute Key
is mapped to Next.
</p>
<p>
Hm.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, the problem was the firmware. My guess is that it was
too old.
</p>
<p>
So here’s what I did:
</p>
<ul>
<li>

site</a>
</li>
<li>
download <a href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases">QMK

</li>
<li>
install it and have it install all the drivers
</li>
<li>
plug the keyboard in while Esc is being pressed
</li>
<li>
pick the firmware downloaded and flash it
</li>

look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2003, 2008,
2013, 2018, 2022 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent
appearances, current writing projects, current reading Daddy-Daughter
Podcast 2023 (permalink) 11 years ago, my kid’s daycare surprised us by
announcing that they were closing for Christmas break a day before
everyone else, so I ended up with our then-four-year-old daughter,
Poesy, at my office for the day. After she got bored with coloring and
playing with my office toys, I sat her down on my lap in front of my
podcast mic and we recorded the greatest, all-singing episode of my
podcast ever: https://craphound.com/news/2012/12/21/happy-hols/ Thus
began an annual tradition. Every year since – save one, when my mic was
busted – we have recorded a podcast: I interview the kid about her
favorite media, apps, books, and hobbies. Sometimes, she gives a
tutorial. Then, we sing a song. She’s 15 now (!), and I still managed to
drag her to the mic this weekend. We discussed her musical favorites,
old (Ike and Tina singing “Proud Mary”) and new (Dominic Fyke). We
discuss high school, volunteering at the zoo, and the rigors of dance
team. She teaches us how to drive. She runs down her favorite apps, and
discusses her recent name change. And then, we sing!
https://craphound.com/news/2023/12/10/daddy-daughter-podcast-2023-edition/
This is the eleventh installment in this time-series snapshots of my
kid, starting in London, then moving to LA, and every year I go back and
listen to the previous recordings. It’s not just a wonderful moment of
nostalgia for me – it’s also a powerful way to put everything into
perspective. Anyone who’s kept a journal (or a blog!) knows, the act of
regular record-keeping, combined with regular revisiting of those
records, turns the impressionistic jumble of memory into a clear picture
of your life and its trajectory. We remember so poorly, but our
treacherous minds fill in those omissions with whatever’s going on right
now, so if times are good now, we remember all times as good. If times
are bad, everything seems bad. The following year sees Poesy far more
confident and even funnier – and excited about working at the zoo
someday:
https://craphound.com/news/2013/12/23/christmastime-daddy-daughter-podcast-with-poesy/
At six, Poesy has learned a little French, and some naughty words for
Jingle Bells (and she’s got a lot more vocal control!):
https://craphound.com/news/2014/12/22/podcast-happy-xmas-guest-starring-poesy/
At seven, Poesy is living in Los Angeles and my mic is very busted, but
Poesy knows all the words to Frosty and she’s got the barrelhouse
walkout nailed:
https://craphound.com/news/2015/12/25/podcast-happy-xmas-guest-starring-poesy-2/
We didn’t manage to record the next year, so we catch up with Poesy at
nine, with her English accent all but gone – but her memory for lyrics
is better than ever (who knew there were so many choruses to “Deck the
Halls?”). This is the first time I interviewed her, for an in-depth
discussion of how to make slime (remember slime?):
https://craphound.com/news/2017/12/23/reviving-my-christmas-daddy-daughter-podcast-with-poesy/
At ten, Poesy is now watching online makeup tutorials and has lots of
advice for you, and is super into squishies:
https://craphound.com/news/2018/12/24/christmas-podcast-with-poesy-2018-edition/
At eleven, Poesy’s no longer willing to sing, but she has lots of
information about riding horses. This is the first year that she’s got
her own music preferences, with half of them being contemporary artists
like Billie Eilish and the other half being older acts like Queen. This
is also the year that she got rid of all her old toys, books and
clothes, because they were “not her style”:
https://craphound.com/podcast/2019/12/20/my-annual-daddy-daughter-xmas-podcast-interview-with-an-11-year-old/
Twelve sees us podcasting from covid lockdown. No song this year, but
she’s playing video games (Among Us), thrifting (while double-masked),
and she’s just discovered Tiktok, along with Tiktok dances, and she’s
started to find cool music that I enjoy:
https://craphound.com/news/2020/12/11/daddy-daughter-podcast-2020-edition/
At thirteen, Poe’s a high school freshman and the singing is back! She’s
big into Drag Race and Ru Paul. And high school sucks so hard that she’d
rather go back to Zoom school. She’s still riding horses, and she’s
fallen in love with a book for the first time in years: Animal Farm (but
she hates the ending):
https://craphound.com/news/2021/12/23/daddy-daughter-podcast-2021-edition/
Last year, Poesy was fourteen, and my office had just flooded out in a
freak rainstorm. Poesy has discovered her argumentative nature, and she
loves hiking in nearby Angeles National Forest. She’s getting into
hiphop – Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Cyprus Hill – and South Park (also
Fleetwood Mac!). We get a lot about Big Mouth, and a long discussion of
her short fiction writing:
https://craphound.com/podcast/2022/12/12/daddy-daughter-podcast-2022-edition/
These annual time-capsules are just tremendous. I may not have had the
discipline to do daily, time-lapse ready photo portraits, but this
corny, silly yearly tradition is more than a way for my kid and me to
spend a few minutes together just before Christmas – they’re a way to
connect to our past and think about the future to come. I can imagine
doing these over Zoom when the kid’s away at university in a couple
years, though who knows if she’ll stand for that. Here’s the podcast
episode:

that should make you cry. So many of our friends on the web are happy to
let Facebook run the new Twitter. What is wrong with you. I don’t know
any better way to put it. Quitting Twitter is pointless, meaningless,
powerless. But not building Threads for Facebook is not meaningless. For
once can people look out for the future, keep the window open for
independence for writers and developers, and let us try out some new
ideas that might not be something Zuckerberg would love? Come on
already. This is the saddest moment, when there’s so much possibility,
and you all are ready to just throw it away. (And no, I don’t believe
for a minute they’re going to do anything that helps the Fediverse. I
know the playbook. Saying you’ll be open is what you do until you
dominate, then it’s just business. Truth is it’s always just business,
and saying you’re going to be open at this stage of network development
<i>is</i> good for business.)</p>

<p>
If you develop one of the ideas I write about here, tell me about it!
</p>
<p>
Let me try it out. Lately there have been people doing this, but for
some reason I don’t find out about the work until it’s too late.
</p>
<p>
What are people thinking? If I ask for something, there’s a reason – I
want to learn from it.
</p>
<p>
I think programmers are shy. You need to stop doing that. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
And of course I’ll share what I learn here on my blog, of course.

want to say this as loudly and clearly as I can. If we want independent
writing on the web to flourish, we need our own search engine, to help
us find each other, and build associations of writers, so we can
influence each other, and help developers create new tools for all
writers. Or simply to find something I wrote about 15 years ago, so I
can refer back to it. I really don’t have a good way yet to find stuff
I’ve written. It’s all there on the web, for crying out loud.
</p>
<p>
More important, we need to learn to work together, we do very very
little of that. It’s amazingly difficult to get a new idea heard by
other developers. This is a huge problem, it’s why we’ve always been
dominated by big companies who don’t care about what we do.
</p>
<p>
Start with a search engine for bloggers. I’ll help. And let’s do lots of
them, so no one can stand in the way of trying out new ideas.

moving on to this year’s BOTY, I thought HCR could help figure out how
we could move past merely reporting on Trump’s danger to democracy,
something that was clear going back to 2015, the news could start
reporting on The Resistance, what we’re doing to prevent the end of
democracy. And in order for that to happen, we have to do newsworthy
things for them to write about! We’re not doing that. It started out
well, with the

March on January 20, 2017</a>, but that was it. We can and must keep
showing up, and I’m not advocating huge marches, I want to see
neighborhood-level marching. Once a month, rain or shine, we all walk
(if possible) or drive to our voting places, where there will be music,
food, people with ideas, dancing, whatever you like. Making civic
participation a regular thing. You go because you want to be there. Not
against something but <i>for</i> all of us. All we have to do is figure
out how this works, how to beat the drum, to get the ball rolling. The
idea is that if we got close to 100 percent voter participation, our
democracy would be in the best shape it’s been in probably since
inception. I had another idea that’s worth considering. We should all
wear the same button, just a picture, no slogans, an idea of what we

photo of
<a href="http://scripting.com/2016/12/30/theMlkButtonsArrived.html">Martin

it didn’t catch on. If we all did, it’s omission would be noticed, and
we’d know there’s someone we should talk with about America and offer
them a free button, nicely, if they’ll put it on right now. Anyway, I’m
putting this out there again, and I’ll keep doing it.</p>

<p>
It’s crunch time at COP28. The United Nations climate summit is
officially scheduled to end tomorrow morning, but is likely to run over,
as much work remains even after a weekend of intense talks and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-10/cop28-al-jaber-tries-to-break-deadlock-with-circular-meeting?sref=a2d7LMhq&utm_source=cbnewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_term=2023-12-11&utm_campaign=Daily+Briefing+11+12+2023" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pleas</a>
for compromise. There is still no consensus on the language in the
global stocktake on the future of fossil fuels – phase out, phase down,
or otherwise. Any agreement to come out of COP must be unanimous,
meaning opposition from just one of the nearly 200 countries
participating can sink a deal. Oil giant Saudi Arabia has “flatly
opposed any language in a deal that would even mention fossil fuels,”
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/10/climate/saudi-arabia-cop28-fossil-fuels.html%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>
<em>The New York Times</em>, adding that Saudi diplomats have
intentionally slowed and obstructed the negotiation process. The United
States, India, Russia, China, and Iraq have all called for caveats or
provisions to a phase out. This morning U.N. Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres returned to the conference and called for an end to the fossil
fuel age. “Now is the time for maximum ambition and maximum
flexibility,” Guterres said.

COP negotiators are considering a historic call for phasing out fossil
fuels in the summit’s global stocktake. The Organization of the
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is working hard to convince its
members – and the world – that this would be a mistake. Last week OPEC’s
leader
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/08/climate/opec-cop28-climate-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">urged</a>
members to reject any text that “targets energy i.e. fossil fuels.” Over
the weekend the group hosted a youth event at the conference “aimed at
convincing young people to support fossil fuels,” Reuters
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/opec-pursues-charm-offensive-cop28-youths-2023-12-10/%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>.

<li>The Cybertruck is eligible for the EV tax credit, but …
</h3>
<p>
Tesla’s Cybertruck is eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit for
2023,
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/700104/tesla-cybertruck-tax-credit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according
to</a> <em>Inside EVs</em>. The all-wheel-drive (AWD) variant and the
tri-motor Cyberbeast are both eligible for the incentive. But there’s a
catch: The tax credit is only available for pickups that cost less than
$80,000, which would disqualify the $99,990 Cyberbeast. And the AWD
version just barely qualifies at $79,990, but deliveries won’t start
until next year. Taken together, this means “there might be no tax
credit for Cybertrucks right now, period,” <em>Inside EVs</em> says. And
this is compounded by the fact that the EV tax credit system is changing
on January 1, and “nobody knows which — if any — EVs will qualify,”
writes
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024%20" target="_self">Heatmap’s
Emily Pontecorvo</a>. “All signs indicate that the list of qualifying
vehicles is set to shrink.”

Argentina’s top climate diplomat Marcia Levaggi insists that the country
will remain part of the Paris Agreement, <em>Reuters</em>

The news follows the shock election of the right-wing candidate Javier
Milei as the nation’s next president. Milei has a history of climate
skepticism. He has called climate change a “socialist lie” and promised
to withdraw the country from the landmark climate agreement. “Yet, since
his victory three weeks ago, the self-described ‘anarcho-capitalist’ has
begun backpedalling on some of his more contentious policies,”
<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/12/10/javier-milei-about-turns-commits-to-paris-climate-agreement/%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a>
<em>The Telegraph</em>. Milei is a former TV star with “striking”
similarities to former President Donald Trump, from his wild hair to his
affinity for conspiracy theories,
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/12/08/javier-milei-argentina-donald-trump/%20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">writes</a>

Nashville), and the ill-fated Titan submersible. But extreme weather
took the largest slice of the pie, with Hurricanes Hilary, Idalia, and
Lee falling into slots 4, 5, and 6, respectively, on the global top 10
news list. When the list was narrowed to U.S.-based searches only, the
hurricanes accounted for 3 of the top 5 searches. <em>The Last Of

<p>Starting in September or so I start thinking about
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ascripting.com+boty">Blogger
of the Year</a>, a thing I do at the end of most years. Not too many
people care, but it’s a good thing for me to do – to review what makes a
blog the most interesting and valuable of the year, to me – obviously.
We all should name a BOTY, or give out any award we feel is deserved.
People think “well it’s just me and I don’t matter” – which is totally
true, and is why you might as well pick someone. At least <i>they’ll</i>
know you appreciate them. And it gets you to think about what you value,
which builds over time to a better understanding of everything. Last
year I <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/01/01.html#a032915">chose</a>
Heather Cox Richardson, whose
<a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/">Substack site</a>
is a constant read for me. Every night an email arrives, at different
times, and if I’m up and in the mood, I’ll spend a few minutes with HCR
and it’s always illuminating. She was my choice last year because her
writing re-kindled my interest in American history, and I started
reading books on most slavery, something that was seriously missing from
my NYC education, and is so important to who we are as a country.</p>

<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
While affordable, accessible child care can help support a strong
workforce, it can often be hard to find. As more companies may look to
recruit and retain workers by offering child care plans — thanks in part
by requirements tied to CHIPS Act funding — we hear how such an
investment is playing out at one plant in Tennessee. Plus, what does
strong consumer sentiment mean for the Federal Reserve’s last meeting of
the year?

Unix philosophy to the 21st century</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-11, from: OS News</p>
<p>The Unix philosophy of using compact expert tools that do one thing
well and pipelining them together to manipulate data is a great idea and
has worked well for the past few decades. This philosophy was outlined
in the 1978 Foreword to the Bell System Technical Journal describing the
UNIX Time-Sharing System: Items i and ii are oft repeated, and for good
reason. But it is time to take this philosophy to the 21st century by
further defining a standard output format for non-interactive use. ↫
Kelly Brazil This seems like a topic people will have calm opinions
about.</p>

Can Own a Backyard Direct Air Capture Plant for $750,000</h2>

<p class="drop-caps">
The future of climate-friendly air travel might lie in a 20-foot
shipping container that was dropped off on the campus of the University
of Sheffield in England in late September.
</p>
<p>
Inside the box is a system developed by
<a href="https://www.missionzero.tech/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Mission
Zero Technologies</a>, a London-based company, that extracts carbon
dioxide molecules directly from the ambient air. University researchers
purchased the tech for about $762,000 for a
<a href="https://terc.ac.uk/sustainable-aviation-fuels-innovation-centre/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">pioneering
project</a> to turn the captured carbon into e-kerosene, a fuel that’s
chemically identical to what’s used in airplanes but is made without oil
or gas.
</p>
<p>
On Monday, Mission Zero announced that this mini “direct air capture”
plant is now officially up and running. It has the capacity to capture
50 tons of carbon dioxide per year. That’s tiny compared to the nearly
37 billion tons emitted by humans last year, but it’s sufficient for the
university’s quest to demonstrate that jet fuel made from CO2 can be
safe and sustainable.
</p>
<p>
“It is kind of a baby system, for sure,” Nicholas Chadwick, Mission
Zero’s CEO told me. “But we think it’s delivering something quite
unique.”

</p>
<p>
When it comes to safely propelling metal tubes weighing hundreds of
thousands of pounds 40,000 feet in the air, without burning fossil
fuels, there are two potential paths. We can use what are called
sustainable “drop in fuels,” cleaner versions of jet fuel that are
compatible with existing planes and engines, but still release carbon
emissions, like e-kerosene. Or, we can re-engineer planes entirely so
that they can be powered by hydrogen or batteries, neither of which
would release any carbon.
</p>
<p>
The first path is much more viable in the near term. Today, small
volumes of sustainable drop-in fuels are already in use. They are mostly
made from animal fat and used cooking oils — often literally
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/air-travel/the-smelly-greasy-truth-about-how-sustainable-aviation-fuel-is-made" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sucked
out of the fryers of fast food restaurants</a>. There’s also potential
to make sustainable drop-in fuels from biomass, like algae, wood
residues from the forest floor, agricultural waste like corn stalks, or
purpose-grown crops like sugar beets.
</p>
<p>
But these resources are limited. “There’s only so much used cooking oil
available in the world,” said Nikita Pavlenko, the program lead for
aviation fuels at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a
research nonprofit. There isn’t enough waste biomass either, he told me,
and growing crops for energy competes with food markets and can lead to
deforestation. This is why capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and using
it to produce e-kerosene is so promising. “The amount of energy and CO2
available is theoretically much, much higher.”
</p>
<p>
Theoretically is the key word there. Even though the concentration of
carbon in the air is high enough to warm the planet, it’s still
relatively dilute, and requires a lot of energy to capture. To make
e-kerosene, the CO2 has to be combined with hydrogen, which also
requires a lot of energy to produce in a clean way. Then the gas mixture
is put through a reactor that converts the gas into a liquid fuel.
</p>
<p>
“You’re kind of swimming upstream in terms of the chemistry and
thermodynamics of it,” said Anu Khan, the deputy director of science and
innovation at Carbon180. “And so it matters a lot where you get the
energy from.”
</p>
<p>
Mission Zero’s technology is unique on that front. Whereas
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climeworks-orca-data-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture" target="_self">Climeworks</a>
and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/heirloom-carbon-microsoft-removal" target="_self">Heirloom</a>,
two other direct air capture companies that have plants operating today,
rely on heat for their processes, the Sheffield project will run solely
on electricity — in part from a solar array on site. Chadwick told me
the system uses between three and five times less energy as a result,
depending on how it is operated.
</p>

</p>
<p>
The company also has a unique business model. Climeworks and Heirloom
own and operate their own plants, and sell carbon credits to other
companies based on the amount of CO2 they remove from the atmosphere and
store permanently. Mission Zero, by contrast, is selling the technology
itself. Third parties can buy its shipping containers and use the system
to do whatever they choose, whether that’s storing the carbon
underground and selling credits, using the carbon to make fuels, or
something else.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Another benefit of Mission Zero’s tech, according to Chadwick, is that
it is made from off-the-shelf parts with established supply chains. The
company was able to deliver the project to the University of Sheffield
within seven months of landing the contract.
</p>
<p>
Using carbon captured from the atmosphere to make fuel is one element of
a larger vision that some climate advocates have for a “circular carbon
economy.” If the carbon is captured and turned into products using
renewable energy, the atmosphere will not be any worse-off.
</p>
<p>
Chadwick said the University researchers hope to develop a certification
process to guarantee the fuel’s safety. The U.K. is in the process of
introducing a
<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1147350/pathway-to-net-zero-aviation-developing-the-uk-sustainable-aviation-fuel-mandate.pdf" target="_blank">sustainable
aviation fuel mandate</a> that will require at least 10% of jet fuel to
be made from sustainable sources by 2030, and is considering an
additional mandate for some portion of that to come from carbon and
hydrogen.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve got to get started now if the scale is going to be there in seven
years,” he told me.

<p>Seventy-five years ago today, on December 10, 1948, the United
Nations General Assembly announced the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights (UDHR). At a time when the world was still reeling from the death
and destruction of World War II, the Soviet Union was blockading Berlin,
Italy and France were convulsed with communist-backed labor agitation,
Arabs opposed the new state of Israel, communists and nationalists
battled in China, and segregationists in the U.S. were forming their own
political party to stop the government from protecting civil rights for
Black Americans, the member countries of the United Nations nonetheless
came together to adopt a landmark document: a common standard of

id="death-of-last-surviving-alaskan-taken-in-wwii-rekindles-memories">Death
of Last Surviving Alaskan Taken in WWII Rekindles Memories</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Gregory Golodoff spent most of his years on a quiet Alaska island,
living an ordinary life, managing a co-op store, fishing for crab and
serving as the village council president. But Golodoff’s recent death at
the age of 84 has reopened a chapter of American history and stirred up
memories of a long-forgotten Japanese invasion that prompted the only
World War II battle on North American soil.</p>
<p>Golodoff was the last survivor among 41 residents imprisoned in Japan
after Japanese troops captured remote Attu Island during World War II.
He was 3 when the island was taken. He died Nov. 17 in Anchorage, his
family said. His sister, Elizabeth “Liz” Golodoff Kudrin, the
second-to-last surviving Attuan, died in February at 82. Three of their
siblings died in captivity.</p>
<p>“The eldest generation has passed away to the other side,” said
Helena Schmitz, the great-granddaughter of the last Attu chief, who died
in Japan along with his son.</p>
<p>Attu is a desolate, mountainous slab of tundra, about 32 kilometers
(20 miles) wide by 56 kilometers (35 miles) long and sits between the
North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea on the volcanic Ring of Fire. It’s
the most westerly island in the Aleutian chain — closer to Russia than
mainland Alaska — and was one of just a few U.S. territories, along with
Guam, the Philippines and the nearby island of Kiska, taken by enemy
forces during the war.</p>
<p>The American effort to reclaim Attu in 1943 amid frigid rain, dense
fog and hurricane-force winds became known as World War II’s “forgotten
battle.” About 2,500 Japanese soldiers perished, many in hand-to-hand
combat or by suicide; 28 survived. Roughly 550 U.S. soldiers died.
Initially trained and equipped to fight in the North African desert,
many suffered from frostbite and exposure due to inadequate gear.</p>
<p>Even after the surviving captives were freed at the close of the war,
they were not allowed to return to Attu because the U.S. military
decided it would be too expensive to rebuild the community. Most were
sent to the island of Atka, about 322 kilometers (200 miles) away.</p>
<p>With the loss of their homeland, the Attuans’ language, Sakinam
Tunuu, is now all but gone, spoken only by members of Schmitz’s
immediate family. The distinctive basket-weaving style of the island is
practiced by just three or four weavers, and not all are of Attuan
descent. Schmitz runs a nonprofit named Atux Forever to revive the
cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Much of what is known about the Alaska Natives’ time in Japan is
chronicled in the book “Attu Boy,” written by Golodoff’s older brother,
Nick, with assistance from his editor, Rachel Mason, a cultural
anthropologist with the National Park Service in Anchorage.</p>
<p>Mason knew the three siblings. Gregory and Liz had little memory of
Attu or Japan, and neither liked to talk about it, she said.</p>
<p>Nick Golodoff, who was 6 when he was captured, had a childlike
innocence about his time as a prisoner, Mason noted. The cover of his
book featured a photograph of him riding on the back of a Japanese
soldier, both smiling.</p>
<p>That experience was far from typical. Of the Attu residents interned
in Japan, 22 died from malnutrition, starvation or tuberculosis.
Schmitz’s great-grandfather, Mike Hodikoff, died with his son of food
poisoning from eating rotten garbage while in Japanese captivity, the
book noted.</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers landed on Attu Island on June 7, 1942, when
residents were attending services at the Russian Orthodox church. Some
ran for their rifles, but Hodikoff told them, “Do not shoot, maybe the
Americans can save us yet,” according to the book.</p>
<p>Instead, the village radio operator, Charles Foster Jones, was shot
and killed before he could alert authorities, becoming the only U.S.
civilian killed by the invading forces in North America, according to a
tribute to Jones by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.</p>
<p>The other residents — all Alaska Natives except for Jones’ wife, a
white teacher from New Jersey named Etta Jones — were kept captive in
their homes for three months before being told to pack up and bring what
food they could for the journey to Japan.</p>
<p>They first went to Kiska, another Alaska island; one Attu resident
died on the way. Stuffed in the cargo hold of a ship, the others
embarked on a two-week voyage to Sapporo, the largest city on Japan’s
Hokkaido Island, where they were kept in four rooms in an abandoned
dormitory. Only Etta Jones was separated from them and taken in a
different boat to an internment facility in Yokohama, south of
Tokyo.</p>
<p>One Japanese guard complained the Attuans ate better than the
Japanese, but conditions worsened when the Alaskans ran out of the food
they brought.</p>
<p>The Golodoffs’ mother, Olean, and others were forced to work long
hours in a clay mine. As their numbers dwindled, she also became the
cook for the surviving POWs, though there was little to make. She was
reduced to gathering orange peels off the street and cooking them on top
of a heater, said George Kudrin, who married Olean’s daughter Liz in
Atka after he returned from the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>“I fed them to my children, and only then would they stop crying for
a while,” Olean once told an interviewer.</p>
<p>Her husband, Lawrence, and three of their seven children died in
Japan. Nick Golodoff lived until 2013. Another son who survived
captivity, John, died in 2009.</p>
<p>Kudrin said Olean didn’t speak of her experiences in Japan, and his
wife, Liz, was too young to remember anything.</p>
<p>“She always knew that she was part of the history of World War II and
she always said, ‘I am a survivor with my mama,’” he said.</p>
<p>American forces reclaimed Attu on May 30, 1943, after a brutal 19-day
campaign. Much of the fighting was waged in dense fog amid winds of more
than 190 kph (120 mph). Attu Island today is part of the Alaska Maritime
National Wildlife Refuge and known more for being one of the top
destinations in North America for groups dedicated to viewing birds,
especially those from Asia.</p>
<p>Greg Golodoff’s wife of 50 years, Pauline, said he never spoke with
her about his experience in Japan or about being the last living
resident of Attu. “I tried to ask him, but he didn’t want to talk about
it,” she said.</p>

Letitia James’ lawsuit. The case threatens Trump’s real estate empire
and cuts to the heart of his image as a successful businessman.</p>
<p>Trump announced he was canceling his testimony in an all-capital
letters, multipart statement on his Truth Social platform, writing: “I
WILL NOT BE TESTIFYING ON MONDAY.”</p>
<p>“I HAVE ALREADY TESTIFIED TO EVERYTHING &amp; HAVE NOTHING MORE TO
SAY,” Trump wrote, adding his oft-repeated claim that James and other
Democrats have weaponized the legal system to hinder his chances at
retaking the White House.</p>
<p>Trump was often defiant and combative when he testified on Nov. 6.
Along with defending his wealth and denying wrongdoing, he repeatedly
sparred with the judge, whom he criticized as an “extremely hostile
judge,” and slammed James as “a political hack.”</p>
<p>Trump answered questions from state lawyers for about 3½ hours, often
responding with lengthy diatribes. His verbose answers irked the judge,
Arthur Engoron, who admonished: “This is not a political rally.”</p>
<p>Had Trump returned to the stand Monday, it would’ve been his defense
lawyers leading the questioning, but state lawyers could have
cross-examined him.</p>
<p>James sued Trump last year over what she claimed was his pattern of
duping banks, insurers and others by inflating his wealth on financial
statements.</p>
<p>Engoron ruled before the trial that Trump and other defendants
engaged in fraud. He ordered that a receiver take control of some Trump
properties, but an appeals court has paused that.</p>
<p>The judge is now considering six other claims, including allegations
of conspiracy and insurance fraud. James seeks penalties of more than
$300 million and wants Trump banned from doing business in New York.</p>
<p>In recent days, Trump had been insistent on testifying again, one of
his lawyers said, even though some of his previous visits to the
courthouse as a spectator have resulted in him getting fined for
disparaging the judge’s law clerk.</p>
<p>The lawyer, Alina Habba, said she had discouraged Trump from taking
the stand because of the gag order that is in place. The same gag order
was also in effect when he testified in November.</p>
<p>“He still wants to take the stand, even though my advice is, at this
point, you should never take the stand with a gag order,” Habba, told
reporters last week. “But he is so firmly against what is happening in
this court and so firmly for the old America that we know, not this
America, that he will take that stand on Monday.”</p>

id="japanese-anime-the-boy-and-the-heron-no.1-at-box-office">Japanese
Anime ‘The Boy and the Heron’ No.1 at Box Office</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>For the first time in Hayao Miyazaki’s decades-spanning career, the
82-year-old Japanese anime master is No. 1 at the North American box
office. Miyazaki’s latest enchantment, “The Boy and the Heron,” debuted
with $12.8 million, according to studio estimates.</p>
<p>“The Boy and the Heron,” the long-awaited animated fantasy from the
director of “Spirited Away,” “My Neighbor Totoro” and other cherished
anime classics, is only the third anime to ever top the box office in
U.S. and Canadian theaters and the first original anime to do so. The
film, which is playing in both subtitled and dubbed versions, is also
the first fully foreign film to land atop the domestic box office this
year.</p>
<p>Though Miyazaki’s movies have often been enormous hits in Japan and
Asia, they’ve traditionally made less of a mark in North American
cinemas. The director’s previous best performer was his last movie,
2013’s “The Wind Rises,” which grossed $5.2 million in its entire
domestic run.</p>
<p>“The Boy and the Heron,” which earlier collected $56 million in
Japan, for years was expected to be Miyazaki’s swan song. But just as it
was making its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in
September, Junichi Nishioka, Studio Ghibli vice president, said the
previously retired Miyazaki is still working toward another film.</p>
<p>“The Boy and the Heron,” has been hailed as one of the best films of
the year. The film, featuring an English dub voice cast including Robert
Pattinson, Christian Bale, Dave Bautista and Mark Hamill, follows a boy
who, after his mother perishes in World War II bombing, is led by a
mysterious heron to a portal that takes him to a fantastical realm. In
Japan, its title translates to “How Do You Live?”</p>
<p>Last week’s top film, “Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” dropped
steeply in its second weekend. The concert film, the second pop star
release distributed by AMC Theatres following Taylor Swift’s “The Eras
Tour,” collected $5 million in its second weekend, a decline of 76% from
its $21 million opening.</p>

Residents Clean Up After Severe Weekend Storms</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Central Tennessee residents and emergency workers cleaned up Sunday
from severe weekend storms and tornadoes that killed six people and sent
more to the hospital while damaging buildings, turning over vehicles and
knocking out power to tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Officials confirmed that three people, including a toddler, died
after a tornado struck Montgomery County 80 kilometers northwest of
Nashville near the Kentucky state line on Saturday afternoon. Some 23
people were treated for injuries at hospitals in the county, officials
said in a news release.</p>
<p>In a neighborhood just north of downtown Nashville, three people were
killed Saturday as a result of tornadoes, the city’s Emergency Operation
Center said in a social media post.</p>
<p>National Weather Service meteorologists said in a posting on X, the
platform formerly known as Twitter, said the destructive tornadoes were
spawned in the Clarksville and Nashville areas.</p>
<p>In Nashville, the roof of a church north of downtown collapsed during
the storm, resulting in 13 people being treated at hospitals, Nashville
emergency officials said in a news release. They were later listed in
stable condition.</p>
<p>Photos posted by the Clarksville fire department on social media
showed damaged houses with debris strewn in the lawns, a tractor-trailer
flipped on its side on a highway and insulation ripped out of building
walls. Video footage from the Tennessee storms showed a ball of fire
rising from behind a row of homes into the sky.</p>
<p>A curfew was in effect both Saturday night and Sunday night in
Clarksville, where officials on Sunday urged motorists to keep away from
the damaged areas so as not to impede the work of first responders and
utility crews.</p>
<p>“We are praying for those who are injured, lost loved ones, and lost
their homes,” Montgomery County Mayor Wes Golden said in a news release.
“This community pulls together like no other and we will be here until
the end.”</p>
<p>Residents in the region are familiar with severe weather in late
fall. Saturday’s storm came nearly two years to the day after the
National Weather Service recorded 41 tornadoes through a handful of
states, including 16 in Tennessee and eight in Kentucky. A total of 81
people died in Kentucky alone.</p>
<p>At least six tornado tracks were reported Saturday in central
Tennessee, according to the National Weather Service. Agency
meteorologist Cory Mueller in Nashville said it was sending out tornado
tracking teams on Sunday to attempt to confirm these potential tornadoes
and calculate their severity.</p>
<p>Mueller said it wasn’t uncommon for tornadoes to be generated during
this time of year.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Nashville Police Department identified the victims
killed north of downtown as Joseph Dalton, 37; Floridema Gabriel Perez,
31; and her son, Anthony Elmer Mendez, 2. Dalton was inside his mobile
home when the storm tossed it on top of Perez’s residence. Two other
children, one in each home, were taken to a hospital with injuries that
were not life-threatening, the department said in a statement.</p>
<p>Montgomery County and Clarksville officials didn’t immediately
respond early Sunday to requests for information about the three deaths
in their area and the injuries.</p>
<p>Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said he and his wife, Maria, were praying for
all Tennesseans who had been affected by the storms.</p>
<p>“We mourn the lives lost and ask that everyone continue to follow
guidance from local and state officials,” Lee said in a statement.</p>
<p>About 45,000 electricity customers were without power in Tennessee
early Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us., down from more than 80,000
on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service issued on Saturday multiple tornado
warnings in Tennessee, and said it planned to survey an area where an
apparent tornado hit in Kentucky.</p>
<p>The Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office said a tornado touched down
around 2 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<p>Shanika Washington said that as soon as she heard the storm sirens
going off in her Clarksville neighborhood, she took her children, ages 5
and 10, to a windowless bathroom in the basement of her townhouse.
During their 20 harrowing minutes in the bathroom, Washington hovered
over her children as a protective shield.</p>
<p>“The back door absolutely did fly open, and you just heard a bunch of
wind,” she said. “The blinds and stuff were like shaking really bad. I
could tell that we were dead smack in the middle of a storm.”</p>
<p>When she came out of the bathroom, she looked out of a window and saw
the destruction: Debris swept onto cars that had their windows broken
out. Shutters ripped from homes. Some roofs were ripped off townhouses.
Air conditioning units and backyard grills were tossed like toys, and
wooden dividers between townhouses were missing.</p>
<p>Because the power in the area was out, Washington took her children
to a hotel for the night.</p>
<p>“I’m still trying to just kind of like process it all,” she said.</p>

id="blinken-israel-failing-to-protect-as-many-civilians-as-possible">Blinken:
Israel Failing to Protect as Many Civilians as Possible</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The United States, Israel’s staunchest supporter in its war against
Hamas militants, said Sunday that the Israeli military is failing in its
announced intention to protect as many Palestinian civilians as possible
who are trying to flee Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>“It’s imperative that civilians be protected,” Secretary of State
Antony Blinken told CNN’s “State of the Union” show. He said Israel had
fallen short in protecting Palestinian civilians as it continues its
offensive against the militants in the narrow enclave along the
Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>The top U.S. diplomat said, “What we’re not seeing are deconfliction
times so [more humanitarian] aid can be brought in” to Gaza and “clarity
of demarcation” lines for areas where Israel will not attack so
civilians can find safe refuge. </p>
<p>The U.N. General Assembly will hold an emergency meeting Tuesday to
vote on a draft resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian
cease-fire in Gaza. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the
U.N., told The Associated Press that it’s similar to the Security
Council resolution the U.S. vetoed Friday.</p>
<p>Intense fighting </p>
<p>After an intense 24-hour combat, Israeli tanks rolled into the center
of Khan Younis, the main city of the southern Gaza Strip Sunday.</p>
<p>The Israeli military said it had struck more than 250 targets in the
past 24 hours, including some in the south near Khan Younis, but also
the Shajaiya neighborhood of Gaza City in the north.</p>
<p>It also said dozens of Hamas fighters had surrendered, encouraging
more of them to do so, but the Palestinian militant group denied this,
calling the claim “false and baseless.”</p>
<p>Israel has vowed to eradicate Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist
group, after Hamas militants invaded southern Israel in a surprise
terror attack on Oct. 7, killed about 1,200 people and captured about
240 hostages. Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, is still holding
about 140 people. </p>
<p>The Hamas-run health ministry says that nearly 18,000 people, mostly
women and children, have been killed in the Israeli air and ground
offensive in the last seven weeks.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization’s executive board was meeting Sunday to
discuss the health situation in Gaza.   </p>
<p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described the health
situation in Gaza as “catastrophic,” adding it will be almost impossible
to improve.</p>
<p>The 34-member board passed an emergency WHO motion by consensus to
secure more medical access in the enclave.</p>
<p>Palestinian officials have also described a disastrous health
situation in Gaza, where Israel’s assault has left most of the
population homeless, with little electricity, food or clean water, and a
medical system facing collapse.</p>
<p>“I must be frank with you: These tasks are almost impossible in the
current circumstances,” Tedros said. Still, he commended countries for
finding common ground, saying it was the first time any U.N. motion had
been agreed on by consensus since the conflict began.</p>
<p>Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian politician who heads the Union of
Palestinian Medical Relief Committees with 25 teams working in Gaza,
said, “Half of Gaza is now starving.”</p>
<p>He said 350,000 people had infections, including 115,000 with severe
respiratory infections. They also are lacking warm clothes, blankets and
protection from the rain, he said.</p>
<p>EU foreign ministers</p>
<p>On Monday, European Union foreign ministers will consider possible
options in response to the Middle East crisis, including a crackdown on
Hamas’s finances and travel bans for Israeli settlers responsible for
violence in the West Bank, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>At a meeting in Brussels, ministers from the bloc’s 27 countries will
also hear from Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba as they discuss
future security assistance to Kyiv.</p>
<p>While EU officials insist helping Ukraine repel Russia’s invasion
remains a top priority, the eruption of the war between Israel and
Palestinian militant group Hamas has forced the bloc to focus anew on
the Middle East.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden has asked Congress for a $110 billion
package of wartime funding for Ukraine ($61.4 billion) and Israel, along
with other national security priorities. But on Wednesday, Republicans
in the U.S. Senate blocked the legislation, saying major U.S. border
security changes were needed.</p>
<p>The war also has exposed long-running and deep divisions on the
broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict among EU countries.</p>
<p>But the ministers will try to find common ground as they consider a
discussion paper from the EU’s diplomatic service that outlines a broad
range of possible next steps.</p>
<p>Hamas is listed by the U.S. and European Union as a terrorist
organization.</p>

<h2 id="how-we-got-here">How we got here</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
First an apology. To all the people who clicked on a
<a href="https://feedland.com/?river=true&screenname=davewiner">link</a>
to a FeedLand page on a phone in the past, I am sorry to have put you
through that. Now that it works on phones, I can see how nice it is to
be able to skim the news while you’re out and about.
</p>
<p>
When you’re working alone on a huge product like this, you have to keep
your head down and focus on the problem of the moment. There have been
some huge ones this year. The product’s identity system had to be
replaced, while people were using it, because Twitter was getting ready
to explode their API. Then the move from a Digital Ocean server to the
<a href="https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/node-js/">Automattic
VIP server</a> required fairly large pieces of the software to be
rewritten, again, in-place, while feedland.org continued to run. There’s
a huge change between writing software for a server where the runtime
environment doesn’t include local storage. Everything has to be stored
in a database.
</p>
<p>
All the pieces were rewritten, one by one, until we discovered another
that needed to be rewritten. And then at almost the last minute I
<a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/09/135922.html">decided</a> we had
to have <a href="http://scripting.com/2023/10/21/143159.html">reading
lists</a>, because of the kind of feed network I wanted to build with
this product. And one more thing, let’s get this mofo working on mobile
devices as it was meant to, which turned out to be not as hard as I
imagined, and very nice to have.
</p>
<p>
The new version of the software with all the new code turned on is at
<a href="https://feedland.com/">feedland.com</a>. That’s the version
that’s running on Automattic’s servers, and should be able to scale to
far more users. The docs aren’t converted yet, but the software is
basically the same. You should read the
<a href="http://docs.feedland.org/firstThings.opml">first page</a> of
the docs, at least, so you aren’t surprised to find out that your
subscriptions are public. This is not the usual kind of feed product,
it’s more of a community of news users. Just like a social network, you
can see what other people are reading. The idea of FeedLand is to see
what would happen if instead of building something complicated around
conversations, we limited ourselves to what feeds could do and then see
where we could go with that. That’s what FeedLand is.
</p>
<p>
PS: I can’t believe how fast Automattic’s system is. I don’t understand
how it does all that work in so little time.
</p>
<p>
PPS: The menus are different on the mobile version, by necessity. I
included the Bookmarks menu, it’s really important to have the news you
want to read available one click away in mobile. I imagine doing setup
on your home computer, with links you’ll use when you’re using the
mobile version.

By David Hegg In logic there is a fallacy known as non sequitur. This
Latin phrase simply means “does not follow” and describes a situation
where a supposed “effect” actually “does not follow” from its supposed
cause. Here is an example – absurd to be sure – of a non sequitur: Where

<h2
id="biden-to-host-zelenskyy-amid-congressional-impasse-on-ukraine-aid">Biden
to Host Zelenskyy Amid Congressional Impasse on Ukraine Aid</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>President Joe Biden will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
at the White House Tuesday as the U.S. administration increases its push
for Congress to approve additional aid to Ukraine in its defensive war
against Russia. </p>
<p>The visit is intended “to underscore the United States’ unshakeable
commitment to supporting the people of Ukraine as they defend themselves
against Russia’s brutal invasion,” the White House said in a statement
Sunday. </p>
<p>Zelenskyy’s office confirmed that he had accepted Biden’s invitation.
He also has been invited to speak to a meeting of all senators.</p>
<p>Biden has asked Congress for a $110 billion package of wartime
funding for Ukraine ($61.4 billion) and Israel, along with other
national security priorities. But on Wednesday, Republicans in the U.S.
Senate blocked the legislation, saying major U.S. border security
changes were needed.</p>
<p>Some Republicans are asking for the immediate deportation of illegal
migrants, stripping them of a chance to seek U.S. asylum. They have also
called for greatly scaling back Biden administration programs that have
allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to enter the U.S.
lawfully.</p>
<p>With U.S. Congress about to go on holiday recess in less than a week,
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has expressed grave concern about
U.S. aid not reaching Ukraine in time as winter looms.  </p>
<p>Speaking Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” Blinken said the United States
is running out of money for Ukraine’s war against Russia. He called on
Congress to act on supplemental funding for Ukraine.</p>
<p>“We need to see the supplemental budget request go through as quickly
as possible,” Blinken said in the interview. He stressed that Ukraine
has done an “extraordinary job” fighting Russian aggression, taking 50%
of its territory back over the past year.</p>
<p>Blinken also pointed out that 90% of the money that goes to Ukraine’s
assistance is invested in the U.S. “In terms of the production of
materials and munitions and weapons that go to the Ukrainians, it’s
right here, in America,” he said.</p>
<p>Lavrov blames Ukraine, US</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Sunday that
the West was trying to exhaust Russia in Ukraine and that any peace
talks would have to be initiated by Kyiv.</p>
<p>“It is up to the Ukrainians to recognize how deep they are in the
hole where the Americans put them,” Lavrov said of the war.</p>
<p>When asked what the chances were of diplomacy bringing about a
cease-fire or peace, he said, “You’ll have to call Mr. [Volodymyr]
Zelenskyy because a year-and-a-half ago he signed a decree prohibiting
any negotiations with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.”</p>
<p>The British defense ministry said Sunday in its daily intelligence
update on Ukraine that Russia has “almost certainly been stockpiling”
air-launched cruise missiles, or ALCMs, for use in its winter campaign
against Ukraine.</p>
<p>The missiles were used Thursday, the ministry said, in a “major wave
of strikes” aimed at Kyiv and central Ukraine.</p>
<p>While the British ministry says the December launch of the missiles
was “probably” designed to degrade Ukraine’s energy infrastructure,
initial reports indicate that Ukraine successfully intercepted most of
them. One civilian was killed, officials said.</p>
<p>Hungarian blockade</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hungarian truckers Monday plan to block Hungary’s main
border crossing with Ukraine in protest of Ukrainian carriers bringing
cheaper products into the European Union country and hurting local
trade.</p>
<p>Truckers from Ukraine have been exempted from permits for crossing
into the EU since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Haulers
across eastern Europe have demanded restrictions on the number of
Ukrainian trucks entering the bloc.</p>
<p>“We have asked the EU … to review its agreement signed with Ukraine
and consider the interests of EU carriers, among them those [of]
Hungary,” Tivadar Arvay, general secretary of the Hungarian Road
Transport Association, told state news agency MTI.</p>
<p>Polish trucks at the Polish-Ukrainian border have been backed up for
kilometers (miles) as Polish truckers block roads to three border
crossings.</p>
<p>Ukraine has managed to bypass the Polish truckers’ blockade by
transporting the first batch of buses to Poland by rail, Ukrainian state
railways Ukrzaliznytsia said Sunday.</p>
<p>Ukrainian authorities say about 3,500 trucks were blocked on the
Polish side of the Polish-Ukrainian border as of Sunday morning. So far,
authorities have not been able to reach an agreement with the
protesters, who, like their Hungarian counterparts, are also seeking to
stop Ukrainian truckers from having permit-free access to the European
Union.</p>

<h2 id="us-sends-first-commercial-offshore-wind-power-onto-its-grid">US
Sends First Commercial Offshore Wind Power Onto Its Grid</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Despite some recent financial setbacks, U.S. offshore wind power has
hit a milestone. A 244-meter-tall turbine is now sending electricity
onto the grid from a commercial-scale offshore wind farm on pace to be
the country’s first.</p>
<p>The moment is years in the making and at the same time a modest
advance in what experts say needs to be a major buildout of this type of
clean electricity to address climate change. </p>
<p>Danish wind energy developer Ørsted and the utility Eversource
announced Wednesday the first electricity from what will be a 12-turbine
wind farm called South Fork Wind 56 kilometers east of Montauk Point,
New York. It will be New York’s first offshore wind farm.</p>
<p>Ørsted and Eversource met Wednesday with New York officials to
celebrate this “first power” milestone, in East Hampton, New York, where
the wind farm connects to the onshore electric grid. They say the
achievement builds a foundation for other large U.S. offshore wind farms
that will follow.</p>
<p>So far, two of the 11-megawatt turbines are up. The second is
undergoing testing, then it can begin producing power too. When the
other ten are spinning and South Fork opens by early next year, it will
be able to generate 132 megawatts of offshore wind energy to power more
than 70,000 homes.</p>
<p>The first power announcement is “an incredible moment in the American
clean energy story,” said Stephanie McClellan, executive director of the
nonprofit Turn Forward, which advocates for offshore wind. She said
South Fork will be a source of clean, reliable, domestically produced
energy.</p>
<p>“This is just the beginning of what offshore wind can do,” she said
in a statement.</p>
<p>Offshore wind is central to New York’s plan to transition to a
carbon-free electricity system by 2040. The state aims to install 9
gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035.</p>
<p>“New York’s nation-leading efforts to generate reliable, renewable
clean energy have reached a major milestone,” New York Gov. Governor
Kathy Hochul said in a statement Wednesday. “South Fork Wind will power
thousands of homes, create good-paying union jobs and demonstrate to all
that offshore wind is a viable resource New York can harness for
generations to come.”</p>
<p>Some Long Island residents at first objected on both environmental
and aesthetic grounds to the transmission line running through their
community. In a lawsuit, four alleged that trenching under roads would
spread contaminated groundwater. A judge dismissed their complaint in
July.</p>
<p>The project has also overcome objections from fishermen and some
environmentalists. Fishermen said they were not adequately compensated
for their loss of fishing grounds. The group Save The Bay said the
energy project shouldn’t be placed near such a rich diversity of
fish.</p>
<p>Business groups and construction unions backed the project.</p>
<p>Large offshore wind farms have been making electricity for three
decades in Europe, and more recently in Asia. The first U.S. offshore
wind farm was supposed to be a project off the coast of Massachusetts
known as Cape Wind. The application was submitted to the federal
government in 2001. It failed after years of local opposition and
litigation.</p>
<p>Turbines began turning off Rhode Island’s Block Island in 2016. But
with just five of them, it’s not a commercial-scale wind farm.</p>
<p>Currently there are two commercial offshore wind farms under
construction in the United States, South Fork Wind and Vineyard Wind.
Vineyard Wind will be a 62-turbine wind farm 24 kilometers off the coast
of Massachusetts. It has not started generating power yet, the developer
said Monday. They’re installing and testing five turbines first.</p>
<p>At State Pier in New London, Connecticut, blades and massive tower
sections for South Fork are lined up, ready to leave port for the sea
where they’ll be erected in the coming weeks. The nacelles that house
the generator for each wind turbine are there, too.</p>
<p>On Monday, a barge carrying three blades and a nacelle for the third
turbine left port. As Jeff Martin, of Eversource, watched, he said it
was a “joy” to see the industry finally move from concept to fruition in
the United States, to help reduce the nation’s dependence on fossil
fuels.</p>
<p>“Finally we’re taking this step to catch up with the rest of the
world and do our part to collectively address climate change,” said
Martin, Eversource’s director of business development for the offshore
wind group.</p>
<p>Large, ocean-based wind farms are a linchpin of government plans to
shift to renewable energy in populous East Coast states with limited
land for wind turbines or solar arrays. The Biden administration aims to
power 10 million homes with offshore wind by 2030 and establish a
carbon-free electric grid five years later.</p>
<p>But the industry has had hard times recently. Ørsted announced it’s
canceling two large offshore wind projects in New Jersey due to problems
with supply chains, higher interest rates and a failure to obtain the
amount of tax credits the company wanted. Developers in New England
recently canceled power contacts too, saying their projects were no
longer financially feasible. The series of setbacks for the nascent U.S.
offshore wind industry jeopardizes the clean energy goals.</p>
<p>Other projects though, are advancing. Ørsted is moving forward with
Eversource on construction of Revolution Wind, Rhode Island and
Connecticut’s first utility-scale offshore wind farm. The 704-megawatt
project will power roughly 400,000 homes. Tower sections, blades and
nacelles are expected to begin arriving in New London as early as this
spring.</p>
<p>South Fork and Revolution Wind are a “bright spot for a challenged
industry,” said David Hardy, group executive vice president and CEO
Americas at Ørsted.</p>
<p>“As we demonstrate that we can build this project and build
Revolution, then people will realize the real opportunity of offshore
wind,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="democrat-john-whitmire-elected-houston-mayor">Democrat John
Whitmire Elected Houston Mayor</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Houston elected Democratic state Sen. John Whitmire as its next mayor
on Saturday night, elevating a Texas lawmaker who has represented the
city for 50 years by giving him a victory over U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee in a runoff.</p>
<p>Whitmire, 74, who is one of Texas’ most powerful Democratic
legislators, will now be at the helm of America’s fourth-largest city.
His campaign focused on reducing crime, improving streets and bringing
people together. He heavily outspent Jackson Lee, who was running to
become Houston’s first Black female mayor.</p>
<p>The congresswoman’s campaign also had to deal with fallout from the
release in October of an unverified audio recording that purported to
capture her profanely berating staff.</p>
<p>Whitmire built an insurmountable lead among early voters, winning
among those voters by 30 percentage points.</p>
<p>Whitmire and Jackson Lee had made it to Saturday’s runoff after
emerging from a crowded field of nearly 20 candidates in the Nov. 7
general election.</p>
<p>Both candidates — two of Houston’s biggest political fixtures —
touted their decades-long political experience as strong qualifications
to lead a growing city facing challenges that include crime, crumbling
infrastructure and potential budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>Whitmire started in the Texas Legislature in 1973, first as a state
representative and the majority of his time as a state senator. Jackson
Lee has represented Houston in Congress since 1995 and before that had
served on Houston’s City Council.</p>
<p>Booming growth over the last decade has caused municipal headaches
but has also turned the Houston area into an expanding stronghold for
Texas Democrats. Although the mayoral race is nonpartisan, Whitmire and
Jackson Lee are both Democrats.</p>
<p>Whitmire will be the oldest big city mayor in the U.S. He is set to
lead a city which is becoming younger, with a median age of around 35
and with 25% of its population below 18, according to census
figures.</p>
<p>The choice between Whitmire and Jackson Lee, who is 73, frustrated
some Democratic voters, particularly younger ones, at a time when the
party is searching for new political stars in Texas who might end 30
years of GOP dominance statewide.</p>
<p>The new mayor will have to deal with new laws from the GOP-led state
government over control of local elections and the ability to impose
local regulations.</p>
<p>Whitmire will replace Mayor Sylvester Turner, who has served eight
years and can’t run again because of term limits.</p>
<p>Whitmire will also lead what is considered one of the country’s most
diverse cities. Of the city’s 2.3 million residents, 45% are Latino,
with 23% Black and 24% white. One in every four Houston residents was
born outside the U.S.</p>
<p>Known as the energy capital of the world, Houston’s economy has long
been tied mainly to the oil industry. But the city is working to become
a leader in the transition to cleaner energy. Like other large U.S.
cities, Houston is also dealing with a lack of affordable housing and
concerns among residents over growing gaps between the rich and
poor.</p>

<h2 id="dead-2-dozen-injured-after-severe-storms-in-tennessee">6 Dead, 2
Dozen Injured After Severe Storms in Tennessee</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Severe storms that tore through the U.S. state of Tennessee killed
six people Saturday and sent about two dozen to the hospital as homes
and businesses were damaged in multiple cities.</p>
<p>Three people, including a child, were killed after an apparent
tornado struck Montgomery County north of Nashville near the Kentucky
state line, county officials said in a news release. And the Nashville
Emergency Operation Center said in a post on a social media account that
three people were killed by severe storms there. Montgomery County
officials said another 23 there were treated for injuries at
hospitals.</p>
<p>Photos posted by the Clarksvillle fire department on social media
showed damaged houses with debris strewn in the lawns, a tractor trailer
flipped on its side on a highway and insulation ripped out of building
walls.</p>
<p>“This is devastating news and our hearts are broken for the families
of those who lost loved ones,” said Clarksville Mayor Joe Pitts in a
statement. “The city stands ready to help them in their time of
grief.”</p>
<p>No other information about the victims was immediately available
Saturday.</p>
<p>The Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that a
tornado touched down around 2 p.m. A shelter was set up at a local high
school.</p>
<p>Residents were asked to stay at home while first responders evaluated
the situation. In a briefing shared on social media, Clarksville Mayor
Joe Pitts said there was extensive damage.</p>
<p>“So please, if you need help, call 911 and help will be on the way
immediately. But if you can, please stay home. Do not get out on the
roads. Our first responders need time and space,” he said.</p>
<p>Allie Phillips, who lives in Clarksville, said she was grabbing lunch
when she began receiving notifications of the tornado that was quickly
approaching her neighborhood.</p>
<p>“It was excruciating watching the live stream and not knowing if my
house was still there,” she said. “When we finally decided to leave, the
road to my home was shut down because so many power lines were on the
road and we had to take a detour.”</p>
<p>Phillips said her home survived with minimal damage – noting that her
daughter’s toys were banged up and that a neighbor’s dog kennel hit the
back of her home – but she was saddened to see that her neighbor’s house
was missing a roof and a home up the block had all but completely
disappeared.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t happen enough that you’re ever prepared for it,” she
said.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service issued multiple tornado warnings in
Tennessee, and said it planned to survey an area where an apparent
tornado hit in Kentucky.</p>
<p>About 85,000 electricity customers were without power in Tennessee on
Saturday night, according to PowerOutage.us.</p>
<p>The storm came nearly two years to the day after the National Weather
Service recorded 41 tornadoes through a handful of states, including 16
in Tennessee and eight in Kentucky. A total of 81 people died in
Kentucky alone.</p>

id="russia-puts-prominent-russian-american-journalist-on-wanted-list">Russia
Puts Prominent Russian-American Journalist on Wanted List</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Russian police have put prominent Russian American journalist and
author Masha Gessen on a wanted list after opening a criminal case
against them on charges of spreading false information about the Russian
army.</p>
<p>It is the latest step in an unrelenting crackdown against dissent in
Russia that has intensified since the Kremlin invaded Ukraine more than
21 months ago, on Feb. 24, 2022.</p>
<p>The independent Russian news outlet Mediazona was the first to report
Friday that Gessen’s profile has appeared on the online wanted list of
Russia’s Interior Ministry, and The Associated Press was able to confirm
that it was. It wasn’t clear from the profile when exactly Gessen was
added to the list.</p>
<p>Russian media reported last month that a criminal case against
Gessen, an award-winning author and an outspoken critic of President
Vladimir Putin, was launched over an interview they did with the
prominent Russian journalist Yury Dud. </p>
<p>In the interview, which was released on YouTube in September 2022 and
has since been viewed more than 6.5 million times, the two among other
things discussed atrocities by Russian armed forces in Bucha, a
Ukrainian town near Kyiv that was briefly occupied by the Russian
forces.</p>
<p>After Ukrainian troops retook it, they found the bodies of men, women
and children on the streets, in yards and homes, and in mass graves,
with some showing signs of torture. Russian officials have vehemently
denied their forces were responsible and have prosecuted a number of
Russian public figures for speaking out about Bucha, handing some
lengthy prison terms.</p>
<p>Those prosecutions were carried out under a new law Moscow adopted
days after sending troops to Ukraine that effectively criminalized any
public expression about the war deviating from the official narrative.
The Kremlin has insisted on calling it a “special military operation”
and maintains that its troops in Ukraine only strike military targets,
not civilians.</p>
<p>Between late February 2022 and early this month, 19,844 people have
been detained for speaking out or protesting against the war while 776
people have been implicated in criminal cases over their anti-war
stance, according to the OVD-Info rights group, which tracks political
arrests and provides legal aid.</p>
<p>Gessen, who holds dual Russian and American citizenships and lives in
the U.S., is unlikely to be arrested, unless they travel to a country
with an extradition treaty with Russia. But Russian court could still
try them in absentia and hand them a prison sentence of up to 10
years.</p>
<p>Pressure is also mounting on dissidents imprisoned in Russia. On
Friday, supporters of Alexei Gorinov, a former member of a Moscow
municipal council sentenced to seven years in prison for speaking out
against the war, reported that his health significantly deteriorated in
prison, and he is not being given the treatment he needs.</p>
<p>Gorinov was sentenced last year and is currently serving time at a
penal colony in the Vladimir region east of Moscow. In a post on the
messaging app Telegram, his supporters said his lawyer visited him on
Friday and said Gorinov “doesn’t have the strength to sit up on a chair
or even speak.” He told the lawyer that he has bronchitis and fever, but
prison doctors claim he doesn’t need treatment, the post said.</p>
<p>The 62-year-old Gorinov has a chronic lung condition, and several
years ago had part of a lung removed, the post said.</p>
<p>Allies of imprisoned opposition leader Alexey Navalny were also
concerned about his well-being on Friday.</p>
<p>Navalny is serving a 19-year prison term on the charges of extremism
in the same region as Gorinov, and for the last three days his lawyers
have not allowed to visit him, the politician’s spokesperson Kira
Yarmysh said on X, formerly known as Twitter. Yarmysh said that letters
to Navalny were also not being delivered to him.</p>
<p>“The fact that we can’t find Alexey is particularly concerning
because last week he felt unwell in the cell: he felt dizzy and lay down
on the floor. Prison officials rushed to him, unfolded the bed, put
Alexey on it and gave him an IV drip. We don’t know what caused it, but
given that he’s being deprived of food, kept in a cell without
ventilation and has been offered minimal outdoor time, it looks like
fainting out of hunger,” Yarmysh wrote.</p>
<p>She added that the lawyers visited him after the incident, and he
looked “more or less fine.”</p>
<p>Navalny is due to be transferred to a “special security” penal
colony, a facility with the highest security level in the Russian
penitentiary system. Russian prison transfers are notorious for taking a
long time, sometimes weeks, during which there’s no access to prisoners,
and information about their whereabouts is limited, or unavailable at
all.</p>
<p>Navalny, 47, has been behind bars since January 2021. As President
Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, he campaigned against official corruption
and organized major anti-Kremlin protests. His 2021 arrest came upon his
return to Moscow from Germany, where he recuperated from nerve agent
poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Navalny has since been handed three prison terms and spent months in
isolation in prison for alleged minor infractions. He has rejected all
charges against him as politically motivated.</p>

id="us-south-korea-japan-urge-international-push-to-curb-north-koreas-nuclear-program">US,
South Korea, Japan Urge International Push to Curb North Korea’s Nuclear
Program</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The national security advisers of the United States, South Korea and
Japan called Saturday for a stronger international push to suppress
North Korea’s development of nuclear weapons and missiles, its
cybertheft activities and alleged arms transfers to Russia.</p>
<p>The meeting in Seoul came as tensions on the Korean Peninsula are at
their highest in years, with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un
accelerating the expansion of his nuclear and missile program and
flaunting an escalatory nuclear doctrine that authorizes the preemptive
use of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The United States and its Asian allies have responded by increasing
the visibility of their trilateral partnership in the region and
strengthening their combined military exercises, which Kim condemns as
invasion rehearsals.</p>
<p>Washington, Seoul and Tokyo have also expressed concerns about a
potential arms alignment between North Korea and Russia. They worry Kim
is providing badly needed munitions to help Russian President Vladimir
Putin wage war in Ukraine in exchange for Russian technology assistance
to upgrade his nuclear-armed military.</p>
<p>Speaking after the meeting, U.S. national security adviser Jake
Sullivan said Washington is working with Seoul and Tokyo to strengthen
defense cooperation and improve its response to North Korean missile
testing and space-launch activities, including a real-time information
sharing arrangement on North Korean missile launches that the countries
plan to start at an unspecified date in December.</p>
<p>He also said the countries have agreed to new initiatives to more
effectively respond to North Korean efforts to bypass U.S.-led
international sanctions that aim to choke off funds for its nuclear
weapons and missile program.</p>
<p>“This will be a new effort with respect to cryptocurrency and money
laundering and how we disrupt North Korea’s capacity to gain revenue
from the hacking and stealing of cryptocurrency and then laundering it
through exchanges,” he said.</p>
<p>Sullivan declined to share detailed U.S. assessments on the types and
volume of North Korean arms being shipped to Russia and didn’t comment
on the specifics of his discussions with South Korean and Japanese
officials over the issue but insisted that “there’s no daylight among us
in terms of the types of weapons transfers that we are seeing. And those
continue and they represent a grave concern for us.”</p>
<p>South Korean intelligence and military officials have said North
Korea may have shipped more than a million artillery shells to Russia
beginning in August, weeks before Kim traveled to Russia’s Far East for
a rare summit with Putin that sparked international concerns about a
potential arms deal. Both Moscow and Pyongyang have denied U.S. and
South Korean claims.</p>
<p>In a joint news conference after Saturday’s trilateral meeting, Cho
Tae-yong, South Korea’s national security office director, said the
three security advisers reaffirmed North Korea’s obligations under
multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions that call for its
denuclearization and ban any weapons trade with other countries, and
agreed to strengthen coordination to ensure that is implemented.</p>
<p>Takeo Akiba, Japan’s national security secretariat secretary general,
said the “unprecedented frequency and patterns” of North Korean
ballistic missile launches necessitate a deeper and more effective
partnership between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo.</p>
<p>South Korea, the U.S., Japan and Australia have also announced their
own sanctions on North Korea over its spy satellite launch last month.
North Korea argues it has the right to launch spy satellites to monitor
U.S. and South Korean military activities and enhance the threat of its
nuclear-capable missiles.</p>
<p>During his conversation with reporters, Sullivan said the allies are
preparing for the possibility that North Korea will up the ante of its
weapons demonstrations and threats in 2024, possibly including the
country’s seventh nuclear test.</p>
<p>Direct military action is also a concern after the North recently
announced it was abandoning a 2018 inter-Korean military agreement on
reducing border tensions after the South partially suspended the
agreement, which had established border buffers and no-fly zones. Some
experts say that has raised the risk of border-area shootings or
clashes.</p>
<p>“Look, when a country announces its intent to walk away from a set of
measures that are designed to help reduce risk and increase stability,
our concern for potential incidents, provocations has to go up,”
Sullivan said, though he said the full implications of the North’s
announcement is not immediately clear.</p>
<p>Sullivan held separate bilateral talks Friday with Cho and Akiba and
also met with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol.</p>
<p>The U.S., South Korean and Japanese national security advisers last
held a trilateral meeting in June in Tokyo.</p>
<p>South Korean intelligence officials have said the Russians likely
provided technology support for North Korea’s successful satellite
launch in November, which followed two failed launches.</p>
<p>North Korea has said its spy satellite transmitted imagery with space
views of key sites in the U.S. and South Korea, including the White
House and the Pentagon. But it hasn’t released any of those satellite
photos. Many outside experts question whether the North’s satellite is
sophisticated enough to send militarily useful high-resolution
imagery.</p>
<p>Kim has vowed to launch more satellites, saying his military needs to
acquire space-based reconnaissance capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="us-approves-sale-of-ammunition-to-israel">US Approves Sale of
Ammunition to Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department has approved the emergency sale of 14,000
rounds of tank ammunition to Israel for about $106.5 million, the Biden
administration said Saturday. </p>
<p>The State Department said it had notified Congress of the sale late
Friday after Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined “an emergency
exists that requires the immediate sale” of the munitions in the U.S.
national security interest. </p>
<p>The purchase will bypass congressional review, which is usually a
requirement for foreign military sales. The action is rare, though not
unheard of, when administrations see an urgent need for weapons to be
delivered without waiting for lawmakers’ approval. At least four
administrations have used the authority since 1979, according to The
Associated Press. </p>
<p>“The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is
vital to U.S. national interests to assist Israel to develop and
maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability. This proposed sale
is consistent with those objectives,” a statement issued by the State
Department said. The ammunition would come from U.S. inventory.  </p>
<p>The sale will be from U.S. Army inventory and consist of 120mm M830A1
High Explosive Anti-Tank Multi-Purpose with Tracer (MPAT) tank
cartridges and related equipment, the Pentagon said in a
statement.  </p>
<p>The move comes as President Joe Biden’s request for a nearly $106
billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel and other national security is
languishing in Congress, caught up in a debate over U.S. immigration
policy and border security.  </p>
<p>U.S. veto  </p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his appreciation
on Saturday for the United States’ veto at the U.N. Security Council,
blocking a demand for a cease-fire in Israel’s war against Hamas in
Gaza.    </p>
<p>“Other countries must also understand that it’s impossible to support
the elimination of Hamas on one side, and on the other to call for the
end of the war, which will prevent the elimination of Hamas,” Netanyahu
said. “Therefore, Israel will continue our just war to eliminate Hamas
and achieve the war’s other objectives that we set.” </p>
<p>Israel also said Saturday it was expanding its military operations in
the southern Gaza Strip. </p>
<p>National security adviser Tzachi Hanegbi said Israeli forces had
killed at least 7,000 Hamas militants so far, without saying how that
estimate was reached. </p>
<p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called Saturday for the United
Nations Security Council to be reformed, decrying the fact that the
United States could veto a cease-fire proposal for Gaza despite huge
support from other countries.  </p>
<p>“The United Nations Security Council demand for cease-fire is
rejected only by U.S. veto. Is this justice?” Erdogan asked at a human
rights conference in Istanbul.  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Agnes Callamard, the secretary-general of the international rights
advocacy group Amnesty International, also disagreed with the U.S. veto,
calling it “morally indefensible and a dereliction of the U.S. duty to
prevent atrocity crimes and uphold international law.”  </p>
<p>The U.S. reasoning against a cease-fire is that it would allow Hamas,
a U.S. – designated terrorist group, to regroup and carry out fresh
incursions. Washington instead supports pauses in fighting to protect
civilians and allow the release of hostages taken by the militants
during the October 7 terror attack on Israel.  </p>
<p>Evacuation order  </p>
<p>Israel ordered residents Saturday to evacuate the center of Gaza’s
main southern city Khan Younis, while the dead and wounded are piling up
at the overwhelmed Nasser hospital there.  </p>
<p>So far, the majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents already have
been forced from their homes, many fleeing several times. With fighting
raging across the length of the territory, residents and U.N. agencies
say there is effectively nowhere safe to go now. Israel disputes this.
 </p>
<p>The World Health Organization’s executive board is scheduled to meet
Sunday to discuss the health situation in Gaza.  </p>
<p>More than a dozen WHO member states already have expressed “grave
concern” about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in the
enclave. Gaza residents “are being told to move like human pinballs,
ricocheting between ever-smaller slivers of the south, without any of
the basics for survival,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres said Friday. “The people of Gaza are looking into the abyss.
The international community must do everything possible to end their
ordeal.”  </p>
<p>The Middle East has been a tinderbox since Iranian-backed Hamas
launched a terrorist attack on Israel on October 7, killing at least
1,200 people while taking about 240 people hostage, Israel said.
Israel’s retaliatory strikes and ground offensive have killed more than
17,700 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health
Ministry.   </p>
<p>Thousands more are missing and presumed buried under rubble. Seventy
percent of the victims are women and children, according to the health
ministry. </p>

<h2
id="university-of-pennsylvania-president-resigns-amid-antisemitism-testimony-backlash">University
of Pennsylvania President Resigns Amid Antisemitism Testimony
Backlash</h2>
<p>date: 2023-12-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania’s president has resigned amid pressure
from donors and criticism over testimony at a congressional hearing
where she was unable to say under repeated questioning that calls on
campus for the genocide of Jews would violate the school’s conduct
policy. </p>
<p>The departure of Liz Magill, in her second year as president of the
Ivy League school, was announced by the school late Saturday afternoon.
The statement said Magill will remain a tenured faculty member at the
university’s Carey Law School. </p>
<p>Calls for Magill’s resignation exploded after Tuesday’s testimony in
a U.S. House committee on antisemitism on college campuses, where she
appeared with the presidents of Harvard University and MIT. </p>
<p>Universities across the U.S. have been accused of failing to protect
Jewish students amid rising fears of antisemitism worldwide and fallout
from Israel’s intensifying war in Gaza, which faces heightened criticism
for the mounting Palestinian death toll. </p>
<p>The three presidents were called before the committee to answer those
accusations. But their lawyerly answers drew renewed blowback from
opponents, which focused on a line of questioning from Representative
Elise Stefanik, a Republican from New York, who repeatedly asked whether
“calling for the genocide of Jews” would violate Penn’s code of
conduct. </p>
<p>“If the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment, yes,” Pressed
further, Magill told Stefanik, “It is a context-dependent decision,
congresswoman.” </p>
<p>Criticism rained down from the White House, Pennsylvania Governor
Josh Shapiro, members of Congress, and donors. One donor, Ross Stevens,
threatened to withdraw a $100 million gift because of the university’s
“stance on antisemitism on campus” unless Magill was replaced. </p>
<p>A day later, Magill addressed the criticism, saying in a video that
she would consider a call for the genocide of Jewish people to be
harassment or intimidation and that Penn’s policies need to be
“clarified and evaluated.” </p>
<p>Magill had been under fire from some donors and alumni this fall over
the university’s handling of various perceived acts of
antisemitism. </p>
<p>That included allowing a Palestinian literary arts festival to be
held on its campus in September featuring speakers whose past statements
about Israel had drawn accusations of antisemitism. </p>
<p>A former U.S. Supreme Court law clerk, Magill, 57, is the daughter of
a retired federal judge and was dean of Stanford University’s law school
and a top administrator at the University of Virginia before Penn hired
her as its ninth president last year. </p>
<p>Earlier Saturday, New York’s governor called on the state’s colleges
and universities to swiftly address cases of antisemitism and what she
described as any “calls for genocide” on campus. </p>
<p>In a letter to college and university presidents, Governor Kathy
Hochul said her administration would enforce violations of the state’s
Human Rights Law and refer any violations of federal civil rights law to
U.S. officials. </p>
<p>Hochul said she has spoken to chancellors of the State University of
New York and City University of New York public college systems who she
said confirmed “that calling for genocide of any group” or tolerating
antisemitism violates codes of conduct on their campuses “and would lead
to swift disciplinary action.” </p>
<p>The governor’s letter doesn’t address specific incidents. Her office
didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. </p>
<p>A popular chant at pro-Palestinian rallies at Penn and other
universities has been falsely misrepresented in recent months as
claiming to call for “Jewish genocide.” </p>
<p>Experts and advocates say the chant, “Israel, we charge you with
genocide,” is a typical refrain heard at pro-Palestinian rallies. Jewish
and Palestinian supporters both acknowledge protesters aren’t saying “We
want Jewish genocide.”</p>
