x-apple-data-detectors is a URL scheme seen in an error message after
clicking on auto-linked text in an Apple Notes app text note, that was
errantly copied as a link from one note to a shared note, which when

ID dependent on source context; avoid such anti-patterns in auto-link
functions.

id="biden-administration-wont-conclude-israel-violated-us-weapons-deals-ap-sources-say">Biden
administration won’t conclude Israel violated US weapons deals, AP
sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A soon-to-be-released Biden administration review of
Israel’s use of U.S.-provided weapons in its war in Gaza does not
conclude that Israel has violated the terms for their use, according to
three people who have been briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>The report is expected to be sharply critical of Israel, even though
it doesn’t conclude that Israel violated terms of U.S.-Israel weapons
agreements, according to one U.S. official. </p>
<p>The administration’s findings on its close ally’s conduct of the war,
a first-of-its-kind assessment that was compelled by President Joe
Biden’s fellow Democrats in Congress, comes after seven months of
airstrikes, ground fighting and aid restrictions that have claimed the
lives of nearly 35,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. </p>
<p>Biden has tried to walk an ever-finer line in his support of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s war against Hamas. He has faced growing
rancor at home and abroad over the soaring Palestinian death toll and
the onset of famine, caused in large part by Israeli restrictions on the
movement of food and aid into Gaza. Tensions have been heightened
further in recent weeks by Netanyahu’s pledge to expand the Israeli
military’s offensive in the crowded southern city of Rafah, despite
Biden’s adamant opposition. </p>
<p>Biden faces demands from many Democrats that he cut the flow of
offensive weapons to Israel and denunciation from Republicans who accuse
him of wavering on support for Israel at its time of need. </p>
<p>Two U.S. officials and a third person briefed on the findings of the
national security memorandum to be submitted by Secretary of State
Antony Blinken to Congress discussed the findings before the report’s
release. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the information
was not yet public. </p>
<p>A senior Biden administration official said the memorandum is
expected to be released later Friday but declined to comment on its
conclusions. </p>
<p>Axios first reported on the memorandum’s findings. </p>
<p>The Democratic administration took one of the first steps toward
conditioning military aid to Israel in recent days when it paused a
shipment of 3,500 bombs out of concern over Israel’s threatened
offensive on Rafah, a southern city crowded with more than a million
Palestinians, a senior administration official said. </p>
<p>The presidential directive, agreed to in February, obligated the
Defense and State departments to conduct “an assessment of any credible
reports or allegations that such defense articles and, as appropriate,
defense services, have been used in a manner not consistent with
international law, including international humanitarian law.” </p>
<p>The agreement also obligated them to tell Congress whether they
deemed that Israel has acted “arbitrarily to deny, restrict, or
otherwise impede, directly or indirectly,” delivery of any
U.S.-supported humanitarian aid into Gaza for starving civilians
there. </p>
<p>Lawmakers and others who advocated for the review said Biden and
previous American leaders have followed a double standard when enforcing
U.S. laws governing how foreign militaries use U.S. support, an
accusation the Biden administration denies. </p>
<p>They had urged the administration to make a straightforward legal
determination of whether there was credible evidence that specific
Israeli airstrikes on schools, crowded neighborhoods, medical workers,
aid convoys and other targets, and restrictions on aid shipments into
Gaza, violated the laws of war and human rights. </p>
<p>Their opponents argued that a U.S. finding against Israel would
weaken it at a time it is battling Hamas and other Iran-backed groups.
Any sharply critical findings on Israel are sure to add to pressure on
Biden to curb the flow of weapons and money to Israel’s military and
further heighten tensions with Netanyahu’s hard-right government over
its conduct of the war against Hamas. </p>
<p>Any finding against Israel also could endanger Biden’s support in
this year’s presidential elections from some voters who keenly support
Israel. Former president Donald Trump is the presumptive 2024 Republican
presidential nominee facing off against Biden.</p>
<p>At the time the White House agreed to the review, it was working to
head off moves from Democratic lawmakers and independent Sen. Bernie
Sanders of Vermont to start restricting shipments of weapons to
Israel. </p>
<p>Israel launched its offensive after an October 7 terror attack by
Hamas into Israel killed about 1,200 people. Two-thirds of the
Palestinians killed since then have been women and children, according
to local health officials. U.S. and U.N. officials say Israeli
restrictions on food shipments since October 7 have brought on
full-fledged famine in northern Gaza. </p>
<p>Human rights groups long have accused Israeli security forces of
committing abuses against Palestinians and have accused Israeli leaders
of failing to hold those responsible to account. In January, in a case
brought by South Africa, the top U.N. court ordered Israel to do all it
could to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza,
but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military
offensive. </p>
<p>Israel says it is following all U.S. and international law, that it
investigates allegations of abuse by its security forces and that its
campaign in Gaza is proportional to the existential threat it says is
posed by Hamas. </p>
<p>Biden in December said “indiscriminate bombing” was costing Israel
international backing. After Israeli forces targeted and killed seven
aid workers from the World Central Kitchen in April, the Biden
administration for the first time signaled it might cut military aid to
Israel if it didn’t change its handling of the war and humanitarian
aid. </p>
<p>Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, in the 1980s and early
1990s, were the last presidents to openly hold back weapons or military
financing to try to push Israel to change its actions in the region or
toward Palestinians. </p>
<p>A report to the Biden administration by an unofficial, self-formed
panel including military experts, academics and former State Department
officials detailed Israeli strikes on aid convoys, journalists,
hospitals, schools and refugee centers and other sites. They argued that
the civilian death toll in those strikes — such as an October 31 strike
on an apartment building reported to have killed 106 civilians — was
disproportionate to the blow against any military target.</p>

id="appeals-court-upholds-steve-bannons-contempt-of-congress-conviction">Appeals
court upholds Steve Bannon’s contempt of Congress conviction</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal appeals court panel on Friday upheld the
criminal conviction of Donald Trump’s longtime ally Steve Bannon for
defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the attack
on the U.S. Capitol. </p>
<p>A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit rejected Bannon’s challenges to his contempt of
Congress conviction for which he was sentenced in 2022 to four months in
prison. The judge overseeing the case has allowed him to remain free
while he pursues his appeal. </p>
<p>Bannon’s attorneys didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking
comment. His lawyers could ask the full appeals court to hear the
matter. </p>
<p>Bannon was convicted of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for
refusing to sit for a deposition and the other for refusing to provide
documents related to his involvement in Trump’s efforts to overturn the
2020 presidential election. </p>
<p>Bannon had initially argued that his testimony was protected by
Trump’s claim of executive privilege. But the House panel and the
Justice Department contended such a claim was dubious because Trump had
fired Bannon from the White House in 2017 and Bannon was thus a private
citizen when he was consulting with the then-president in the run-up to
the riot. </p>
<p>Bannon’s lawyers argued at trial that he wasn’t acting in bad faith
but was trying to avoid running afoul of executive privilege objections
Trump had raised. The onetime presidential adviser said he wanted to
have a Trump lawyer in the room for his appearance, but the committee
wouldn’t allow it. </p>
<p>Bannon’s lawyers told the appeals court that the conviction should be
overturned because, among other reasons, they said the committee’s
subpoena was invalid. Bannon also argued that the judge that oversaw the
trial wrongly quashed subpoenas seeking testimony and records from the
committee’s own members, staffers and counsel his lawyers argued could
have bolstered his defense. </p>
<p>The appeals court said all of his challenges lacked merit. </p>
<p>“We conclude that none of the information sought in the trial
subpoenas was relevant to the elements of the contempt offense, nor to
any affirmative defense Bannon was entitled to present at trial,” the
judges wrote. </p>
<p>A second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted
of contempt of Congress and reported to prison in March to serve his
four-month sentence. Navarro has maintained that he couldn’t cooperate
with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But
courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn’t prove Trump
had actually invoked it.</p>

id="biden-set-to-impose-tariffs-on-chinese-electric-vehicles-sources-say">Biden
set to impose tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, sources say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON AND SAN FRANCISCO — U.S. President Joe Biden is set to
announce new tariffs on China as soon as next week, targeting strategic
sectors, including electric vehicles, according to two people familiar
with the matter. </p>
<p>The full announcement, which could take place as soon as Tuesday, is
expected to largely maintain existing levies, according to one of the
people. An announcement could also be pushed back, the person said. </p>
<p>The tariffs were also set to include semiconductors and solar
equipment, according to one of the people. </p>
<p>Details on the precise value or categories of tariffs that would be
imposed were sketchy, but the administration was said to have zeroed in
on areas of interest within strategic competitive and national security
areas, one of the people said. </p>
<p>The U.S. Trade Representative’s office made its recommendations to
the White House weeks ago, but a final announcement was delayed as the
package was debated internally, according to one of the sources and an
additional person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Biden, a Democrat seeking reelection in November, is looking to
contrast his approach with that of Republican candidate Donald Trump,
who has proposed across-the-board tariffs that White House officials see
as too blunt and prone to spark inflation. </p>
<p>The White House and the office of the U.S. Trade Representative
declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the story. </p>
<p>The measures could invite retaliation from China at a time of
heightened tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump’s
broader imposition of tariffs during his presidency prompted China to
retaliate with its own levies. </p>
<p>Biden has said he does not want a trade war with China even as he has
said the countries have entered a new paradigm of competition. </p>
<p>Both 2024 presidential candidates have sharply departed from the
free-trade consensus that once reigned in Washington, a period capped by
China’s joining the World Trade Organization in 2001. </p>
<p>In 2022, Biden launched a review of the Trump-era policy under
Section 301 of the U.S. trade law. Last month, he called for sharply
higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese metal products, but the targeted products
were narrow in range, estimated at more than $1 billion of steel and
aluminum products, a U.S. official said. </p>
<p>Biden also announced launching an investigation into Chinese trade
practices across the shipbuilding, maritime and logistics sectors, a
process that could lead to more tariffs. </p>
<p>The Biden administration has also been pressuring neighboring Mexico
to prohibit China from selling its metal products to the United States
indirectly from there. </p>
<p>China has said the tariff measures are counterproductive and inflict
harm on the U.S. and global economy.</p>

<h2 id="will-space-weather-blow-out-my-solar-panels">Will Space Weather
Blow Out My Solar Panels?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjIxNTc3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MTk1NTYyMX0.sIoandJNQPN0SVLIjhZM2yHEix-6GSNyehWAyLiSJnk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
You have probably heard by now that there’s a big solar storm on its way
toward us. (If not, sign up for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/solar-storm-watch-noaa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">Heatmap
AM</a>, our daily roundup of climate and energy news.) On Wednesday, the
sun started ejecting massive columns of geomagnetic activity out into
space in Earth’s direction. That geomagnetism is due to arrive around
11p.m. ET on Friday, triggering huge fluctuations in the Earth’s
geomagnetic field.
</p>
<p>
Those fluctuations can actually generate their own electric current. And
too much of that current can wreak havoc on the electrical grid.
</p>
<p>
The last time we got a heads up like this about a geomagnetic surge of
this magnitude was in 2005, when coal generation was close to its peak
in the U.S. and renewables were providing
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/" target="_blank">less
than half</a> the energy they do now. So how does that changing energy
mix affect the risk to the grid this time around?
</p>
<p>
Not too much, said representatives from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Organization on Friday morning. The other thing that’s
happened since 2005 is that we’ve started paying a lot more attention to
space weather — which, despite its name, bears little resemblance to
Earth weather — which means grid operators are a lot better prepared to
deal with it.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve been working with the power distribution community over the past
decade to help them better understand space weather,” Rob Steenburgh, a
space scientist with NOAA, said in a press briefing. “And their
engineers have taken that information and used it to build systems that
can protect the power lines more rapidly than they could before. So
we’ve seen improvements in technology on the grid that get triggered by
these events, and then work to protect the different assets.”
</p>
<p>
Grid operators can also respond in lower tech ways, such as by
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-grid-summer-heat" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_self">deferring
maintenance</a> or taking systems offline. And to be clear, if there are
any grid effects, those will happen just to long-distance transmission
lines. Transformers and any wires connecting to your house should be
totally fine.
</p>
<p>
Will the solar storm affect solar panels? According to NOAA, any panels
here on Earth should be totally fine since they’re protected by the
planet’s atmosphere. Solar panels in space, e.g. those powering
satellites, are at more risk depending on the height of their orbit,
particularly if they’re outside the reach of the Earth’s magnet field.
</p>
<p>
The magnetic field will also determine how bad the storm gets here.
Earth’s magnetic field points northward. (That’s why compasses work.) If
the the solar storm’s magnetic field is oriented in the same direction,
its effects will be dampened. “Think of a magnet,” said Shawn Dahl,
another of NOAA’s space weather forecasters. “If you take two negative
magnets and you try to put them together, they don’t connect, right?
Same thing here.” That magnetic orientation can change in the course of
a single storm, however, and if suddenly those two poles start drawing
together, the effects can intensify.
</p>
<p>
As of now, NOAA has classified the situation as a severe geomagnetic
storm — G4, on a scale that goes up to G5 — of which several have hit
Earth since 2005, including one in late March. Those were weaker than
the one barreling toward us at the moment, however, although we won’t
know how severe this one will be until it passes satellites stationed
about a million miles out in space — that is, at most 45 minutes before
it hits.
</p>
<p>
So, is NOAA concerned? “Yeah, we’re a little concerned,” Dahl said,
adding that in addition to coordinating with utilities and other
operators of critical infrastructure, NOAA is also briefing the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. GPS and other satellite-dependent
technologies could experience disruptions. Will those be debilitating to
society? Probably not.
</p>
<p>
There’s also one big upside: “The biggest manifestation of space weather
is the aurora,” Steenburgh said, a.k.a. the Northern Lights, which could
be visible as far south as Alabama. Even if you can’t see anything with
the naked eye, it’s worth pointing your cell phone at the sky and
snapping a pic, said Brent Gordon, another NOAA space scientist.
</p>
<p>
“Cell phones are much better than our eyes and capturing light,” Gordon
explained. “Just just go out your back door and take a picture with a
newer cellphone and you’d be amazed at what is what you see in that
picture versus what you see with your eyes.”

Are the Least Popular Part of a Carbon-Free Grid</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE5NzE4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMjAyMjQxM30.jsvOcHRvprlXqGgIzoIDv_suOV_KJSsMKlgzK9ama64/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Here’s a shocker: Americans aren’t exactly unified in their takes on the
energy transition. In a new Heatmap poll conducted by Embold Research,
about a third of the more than 2,000 adults surveyed agreed that
“renewable energy offers many significant benefits, with few downsides,”
while about half that number said renewables have “many significant
downsides, with few benefits.” Go figure.
</p>
<p>
Dig beneath the surface, however, and some fascinating fault lines begin
to emerge. Often, these divides cut across class, gender, and even party
affiliation.
</p>
<p>
Take the public’s opinion on batteries, for instance. Of all the
possible sources of zero-carbon power we asked people about, battery
storage scored the lowest, with just 23% saying they strongly supported
adding them to the energy mix in their state. By comparison, 51% said
they strongly supported rooftop solar, and 36% said they strongly
supported nuclear, typically a controversial energy source. Only coal
and “methane gas” scored lower (although when we called it “natural
gas,” it polled much higher).
</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<p>
What’s the problem with batteries? One possibility is that even though
utility-scale battery storage system fires are rare — the Electric Power
Research Institute database of battery-related
“<a href="https://storagewiki.epri.com/index.php/BESS_Failure_Event_Database#The_Data_in_Context" target="_blank">failure
events</a>” lists just 15 last year, though one was a
<a href="https://agenda.canyoncounty.id.gov/SupportDoc/GetSupportingDoc?supportDocID=1526" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multi-day
fire in a storage system in Idaho</a> — people may group them together
with far more common lithium-ion battery fires with scooters and
e-bikes.
</p>
<p>
“Lithium ion battery fires are rarities when considered in the context
of widespread deployment,” Lakshmi Srinivasan and Stephanie Shaw, who
both work on battery storage policy and research at EPRI, co-signed in
an email. “There are also important differences between grid-scale
storage and electric micro-mobility devices like bikes and scooters” —
namely that grid-scale batters are subject to regulations and testing
requirements that your e-bike’s battery is not, which reduces the risk
of fires.
</p>
<p>
As with any major piece of energy infrastructure, the prospect of
grid-scale batteries can also spark the public’s generic aversion to new
construction and the sight of industrial equipment. California — which
leads the country in battery storage procurement and deployment — has
not been free from
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/lithium-ion-battery-fires-storage" target="_blank">local
backlash</a> to utility-scale battery storage projects. A long-planned
project in San Diego County has faced
<a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/story/2024-03-29/why-this-battery-storage-plant-between-escondido-and-san-marcos-has-some-residents-upset" target="_blank">persistent
opposition</a> from nearby residents, even after it was scaled down by
20%, while a project north of San Francisco was
<a href="https://www.thereporter.com/2024/01/11/vacaville-city-council-votes-rejects-battery-storage-exemption/amp/" target="_blank">rejected
entirely</a> due to concerns about safety.
</p>
<p>
Besides the fire and visual concerns, many people don’t understand that
battery storage projects fall under the category of clean energy,
especially in California where they’re most prevalent. When asked to
identify which types of power generation they considered “clean,” only
19% picked out battery storage, compared to 78% for solar — which is
increasingly co-located with battery storage — 76% for wind, and even
37% for natural gas. The only forms of power that ranked below battery
storage were, again, “methane gas” and coal.<br/>
</p>
<p>
While solar and wind — which battery systems can support — are well
known to just about everyone, widespread deployment of battery storage
is still fairly new. While Heatmap’s survey showed relatively high
disapproval for battery storage, it also was the third most “not sure”
energy source behind hydrogen and geothermal, two technologies that have
yet to reach mass adoption in the U.S. “All new technologies are a bit
of a black box until education is provided,” the two EPRI researchers
said.<del></del>
</p>
<p>
That education might also include how people might benefit<strong>.
</strong>“Storage is a key driver of grid resilience and reliability,”
Srinivasan and Shaw explained. That means fewer service interruptions
for any reason, and particularly during severe weather, when back-up
energy may be necessary to keep food cold and shelters
warm<strong>.</strong> “All that said,” they added, “another important
benefit of storage is that it supports extensive use of renewables
technologies, so the most use can be made of those as well as making the
electricity grid cleaner for everyone.”
</p>
<p>
It’s true that not all battery storage systems necessarily lead to lower
carbon emissions. And yet batteries are absolutely essential to a
decarbonized electric grid — and to keeping grids with high levels of
weather-dependent resources like wind and solar stable. It’s no
coincidence that two states with large amounts of renewable power on the
grid, California and Texas, are also
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-california-grid-batteries" target="_blank">leaders
in battery storage deployment</a>.
</p>
<p>
“While many members of the public prioritize implementing renewable
energy, NIMBY concerns can be strong in some instances, often based on
misinformation,” Srinivasan and Shaw told me. “Support for renewable
technologies is often dependent on the tangible local benefits of the
facility, rather than broader decarbonization impacts.”
</p>

id="feds-have-significant-safety-concerns-about-ford-fuel-leak-recall-and-demand-answers-about-the-fix">Feds
have ‘significant safety concerns’ about Ford fuel leak recall and
demand answers about the fix</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DETROIT — Federal investigators say they have “significant safety
concerns” about a Ford SUV recall repair that doesn’t fix gasoline leaks
that can cause engine fires.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is demanding
volumes of information from the automaker as it investigates the fix in
a March 8 recall of nearly 43,000 Bronco Sport SUVs from the 2022 and
2023 model years, and Escape SUVs from 2022. All have 1.5-liter
engines.</p>
<p>Ford says the SUVs have fuel injectors that will crack, allowing gas
or vapor to leak near hot engine parts that can cause fires, fuel odors
and an increased risk of injuries.</p>
<p>In an April 25 letter to Ford released Thursday, the agency’s Office
of Defects Investigation wrote that based on its review of the recall
repairs, it “believes that the remedy program does not address the root
cause of the issue and does not proactively call for the replacement of
defective fuel injectors prior to their failure.”</p>
<p>Ford’s remedy for the leaks is to add a drain tube to send the gas
away from hot surfaces, and a software update to detect a pressure drop
in the fuel injection system. If that happens, the software will disable
the high-pressure fuel pump, reduce engine power and cut temperatures in
the engine compartment. Owners also will get a “seek service”
message.</p>
<p>But in the 11-page letter to the automaker, the agency asks Ford to
detail any testing it did to verify the remedy resolved the problem and
whether hardware repairs are needed. It also asks the company to explain
any other remedies that were considered and any cost-benefit analysis
the company did when it picked the fix.</p>
<p>Safety advocates have said Ford is trying to avoid the cost of
replacing the fuel injectors and instead go with a cheaper fix that
drains gasoline to the ground.</p>
<p>Ford said Thursday that it is working with the NHTSA during its
investigation.</p>
<p>NHTSA also is asking ford to detail how the software will detect a
fuel pressure drop, how much time elapses between cracking and
detection, and what messages will be sent to the driver. It also asks
what effect disabling the high-pressure fuel pump has on other fuel
system parts, and how the SUVs will perform when the pump is
disabled.</p>
<p>The agency also wants to know how much fuel will leak and whether the
amount complies with federal environmental and safety standards. And it
wants to hear Ford’s take on “its obligations (legal, ethical,
environmental and other) to prevent and/or limit fuel leakage onto the
roadway at any point during a vehicle’s lifespan.”</p>
<p>Ford has to provide information to the agency by June 21, the letter
said. Depending on the results of its investigation, the agency can seek
additional repairs that fix the fuel leaks.</p>
<p>The company has said in documents that it has reports of five
under-hood fires and 14 warranty replacements of fuel injectors, but no
reports of crashes or injuries.</p>
<p>In a previous email, Ford said it is not replacing fuel injectors
because it is confident the recall repairs “will prevent the failure
from occurring and protect the customer.” The new software triggers a
dashboard warning light and allows customers to drive to a safe
location, stop the vehicle and arrange for service, the company said.
NHTSA documents filed by Ford say the problem happens only in about 1%
of the SUVs.</p>
<p>The company also said it will extend warranty coverage for cracked
fuel injectors, so owners who experience the problem will get
replacements. Repairs are already available, and details of the extended
warranty will be available in June, Ford said.</p>
<p>The recall is an extension of a 2022 recall for the same problem,
according to Ford. The repair has already been tested on vehicles
involved in the previous recall, and Ford said it’s not aware of any
problems.</p>
<p>The company also said it isn’t recommending that the SUVs be parked
only outdoors because there’s no evidence that fires happen when
vehicles are parked, and the engines are off.</p>
<p>NHTSA said in documents that in the 2022 recall, which covered nearly
522,000 Bronco Sports and Escapes, Ford had the same remedy as the
latest recall.</p>

Trump has proposed sweeping tariff hikes on China that some analysts say
would boost inflation. But both candidates no doubt want to be seen as
tough on China, which largely dominates in global EV sales and is a
major producer of cheap solar and battery tech. The Biden administration

moving some $270 billion worth of cargo every year. But a record
prolonged drought in the region has reduced the number of daily
crossings over the last year or so. Increased rainfall means the drought
is beginning to ease, and authorities will start slowly permitting more
traffic over the coming months.

The amount of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere jumped in March,

to UC San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>, the global
average concentration of CO2 in March was 4.7 parts per million (ppm)
higher than in March last year, which is a greater leap than the
previous highest increase of 4.1 ppm recorded in 2016. “We sadly
continue to break records in the CO2 rise rate,” said Ralph Keeling,
director of the CO2 program at the institute. “The ultimate reason is
continued global growth in the consumption of fossil fuels.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The unusual jump is due partly to the El Niño event and an
“unusual dip” in March 2023. But the records show that the rate of
growth is generally increasing as we continue to burn fossil fuels.
Keeling added that a very high growth rate could continue for several
more months. “This recent surge shows how far we still need to go to
stabilize the climate system,” he said. “Stabilization will require that
CO2 levels start to fall. Instead, CO2 is rising faster than ever.” Back

<h2>
Let’s start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?
</h2>
<p>
Hi everyone, I’m Riccardo Mori. When it’s time to introduce myself, I
rarely deviate from what you can read in the
<a href="https://morrick.me/en/about">About Me</a> page on my website,
mostly because I did my best there to condense so much information in a
few paragraphs. Anyway, I’m from Italy but I permanently relocated to
Spain almost 20 years ago. I’m a writer — I write about technology,
design, user interfaces and usability, but I also write fiction. While I
wish writing were my one and only job, the daily bread is currently
provided by my work as freelance translator and localisation specialist.
</p>
<p>
My educational background is rooted in the liberal arts. During my
university years, I focused on philology, Italian and English
literature, and art history. While I was in uni I also did some theatre,
both as an actor and also as a dramatist, but that was a brief
experience. Something that lasted a bit longer were reading
performances, where I used to read some of my poetry in front of a live
audience. There were also specific pieces I wrote for specific
performances where I was accompanied by jazz musicians. I also did some
book designing work and I even worked at an advertising agency for a
relatively brief period of time.
</p>
<p>
How did I end up doing what I do today? Well, my fascination with
computers started at a young age, in the early 1980s (yeah, this is sort
of an age reveal, haha), and towards the end of that decade I was
involved with DTP (Desktop Publishing) and the Macintosh as my primary
platform. I had been wanting an Apple computer for a long time, but back
then those machines were really out of my and my family’s budget. Having
the opportunity to use them for work was a blast. My first workstation
was a Macintosh SE with a laser printer and a handheld black-and-white
scanner. But I had to wait until 1993 to finally be able to have a Mac
all for myself. Up until then, it was essentially PC at home, and Mac at
work. Which actually was kind of cool, because I was learning a lot of
things about both platforms.
</p>
<p>
So, as my technical experience grew during the 1990s, I started doing
some freelance work as ‘tech support guy’ and consultant. At the same
time, I was equally busy on the literary side: between the late 1980s
and early 1990s I wrote a lot of poetry and short stories, and in 1993 I
started <em>Laboratorio Quillink</em> <em>(The Quillink Workshop)</em>,
later renamed <em>Quillink Press,</em> a sort of small design &amp;
print centre aimed at publishing and distributing my own and other
people’s works, which soon became the official brand for all my
self-published material.
</p>
<p>
Since I had been studying English since the age of 4, by this time I was
quite proficient and fluent in it, so I did some literary translations
as well. Then I was commissioned a few technical translations for
computer magazines, and eventually I started freelancing as technical
translator (this was late 2000-early 2001). I was a collaborator of
Macworld Italia magazine for the better part of the 2000s. Another thing
I’m proud of is that in the years 2001-2010, I translated into Italian
Bruce Schneier’s
<a href="http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html"><em>Crypto-Gram</em></a>,
free monthly newsletter providing summaries, analyses, insights, and
commentary on security. By the way, I strongly recommend subscribing to
it and following Schneier’s work if you care about cybersecurity and
security in general (and in today’s world, you definitely should care
about this stuff).
</p>
<p>
After relocating to Spain and learning Spanish, I extended my
translation services to include Spanish as well. For the past 8 years or
so, my translation work has for the most part shifted towards
localisation, which means providing translations for software
applications and interfaces; and this has its own set of challenges, as
you don’t simply translate text from a language to another. You often
have to work with UI constraints, and you have to translate following a
specific context with its own rules, which may change from project to
project.
</p>
<p>
I really hope this doesn’t come across as me bragging about all the
things I’ve done… The truth is, there are people who, right from the
start, have a clear idea of what they will do in their lives, and they
work relentlessly towards that goal. I’m not one of those people. Sure,
I knew I wanted to be a writer, and I worked hard to be a good writer,
but I soon realised that writing was simply not enough to make a living.
I’ve always been a curious person, obsessed with learning stuff and
expanding my knowledge. All the things I’ve mentioned here — and,
believe me, I left out a lot of other stuff — just reflect this kind of
hunger, and also the need to find my path in life.
</p>
<p>
When you have so many interests, you end up having a lot of hobbies too,
but since this is getting long already, I’ll just briefly mention
photography, vintage technology and devices, typography, watches and
horology in general, music and gaming. Of course I don’t have enough
time to be a real nerd in any of these sectors (apart maybe from
photography, which is something I cultivated since the 1980s, in film
and digital format), so I’ll typically go through these in a sort of
rotation, with periods where I’m more into typography, or watches, or
old computers, etc. You get the idea.
</p>
<h2>
What’s the story behind your blog?
</h2>
<p>
I started writing online in 1998, but at first my contributions were
limited to mailing lists and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup">Usenet
newsgroups</a>. In 2001 I opened an account on LiveJournal, and kept a
sort of hybrid between blog and journal for many years there. In its
early years, LiveJournal was a fantastic social network, deeper and more
meaningful than anything that came after, like Facebook, Twitter or
Tumblr. I have ‘met’ people there I still correspond with after all
these years; people whom I consider good personal friends and not just
Internet acquaintances.
</p>
<p>
The years between circa 2000 and 2007 saw a real boom for the blog as a
form of personal expression, and I was fascinated. So much quality
writing, so many interesting subjects, so many interesting people,
especially in the tech sphere. But before WordPress came about, having a
personal blog meant doing almost everything by hand. Registering a
domain, paying for Web hosting, and knowing your HTML (and later CSS and
JavaScript) to craft your own website. I didn’t have that expertise, and
I didn’t know where to begin. When Apple launched iTools — the first
iteration of what would become MobileMe and then iCloud — one of the
service’s features was giving each user a small personal Web space
(HomePage) to publish online. My first official tech blog was published
there using a mediocre Mac application called BlogWave Studio. This was
around late 2004-early 2005. It was mostly in Italian.
</p>
<p>
It was bare-bones, slow to load, clunky to publish. When WordPress
arrived in 2006 (if I remember well), that changed everything. I opened
an account on <a href="https://WordPress.com">WordPress.com</a> (the
free blogging service) and published my ‘proper’ tech blog in Italian
there from late 2005 to 2010. It was called <em>Autoritratto con
mele</em> (“Self-portrait with apples”) to mean it was about tech from
the perspective of an Apple user.
</p>
<p>
To reach a wider audience, and taking advantage of how easy publishing
with WordPress was, I started a tech blog in English around 2007, called
<em>The Quillink Observer</em>. Having two separate blogs seemed a good
idea at the time. I could provide articles and insights for both my
Italian audience, and the wider English-speaking audience at large.
</p>
<p>
But then I started <em>yet another blog</em> in 2008, to specifically
talk about my passion for vintage Macs, vintage software and technology
in general. It was aptly called
<em><a href="http://systemfolder.wordpress.com/">System Folder</a></em>.
It’s still accessible, but sadly these past years I’ve only had very
little time to update it.
</p>
<p>
At this point, however, properly maintaining three main blogs was
becoming a little too much work. So in 2011 I finally decided to merge
<em>Autoritratto con mele</em> and <em>The Quillink Observer</em> into
one website featuring articles in both English and Italian. I also
decided it was time to own my identity, so I launched
<strong><a href="http://morrick.me">morrick.me</a></strong> by
registering and paying for the domain and for the Web hosting, and using
WordPress as content management system because it was the one I was most
familiar with, and still one of the most flexible.
</p>
<p>
When I was ready to launch my website/blog, I tried hard to find a name
that could be catchy and also could really encapsulate my identity. But
the few decent names I came up with just weren’t good enough, so my
blog’s title is simply my name.
</p>
<p>
As for the writing style and my main source of inspiration: it was John
Gruber and his <em>Daring Fireball</em> blog, initially. He has
certainly inspired a lot of tech bloggers and writers over the years,
and I have enjoyed his production for a long time. Lately, however, I
feel he has lost a lot of his initial objectivity and what I call
‘critical grip’ by being a bit too close to Apple.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, my main blog is 13 years old, and it has gone
through three major visual redesigns. Every time I changed its look, it
was mostly due to strictly technical reasons: the blog’s WordPress theme
was no longer supported, the theme creator couldn’t keep up with
WordPress’ updates, and things started to break. At first I tried
salvaging the whole theme structure by heavily editing chunks of CSS
myself, but it was too cumbersome, and ultimately too fragile. Switching
to a better-maintained WordPress theme was more efficient. The one I’m
currently using is a paid theme by a small company called
<a href="https://www.elmastudio.de/en/">ElmaStudio</a>, it’s still
maintained, and it’s simple enough to not interfere too much with the
platform updates WordPress routinely puts out.
</p>
<p>
You can see how my blog looked in 2011, and read about other trivia
(like the evolution of my identity logo) in an article I published in
2021, <a href="https://morrick.me/archives/9398"><em>10 years of
morrick.me</em></a>.
</p>
<h2>
What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?
</h2>
<p>
I remember one tech blogger writing, many years ago, that the secret of
a successful blog was to ‘show up every day, no matter what’. I
appreciate those who do, those who indeed publish daily or almost daily
on their blogs. But it’s just not my style. It’s not bad advice, but to
me it feels like business advice. And for me, having a blog isn’t a
business endeavour. I have a blog because I want to share knowledge and
perspectives. It’s because I want to communicate whenever I feel I have
something to say. Consequently, I only publish when I have something to
say. As I wrote <a href="https://morrick.me/archives/9727">in a past
article</a>, for something to appear on my blog, three main conditions
have to be fulfilled:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
I have something to talk about, something to say.
</li>
<li>
I feel I have something useful to add to the conversation.
</li>
<li>
I have time and will to commit to writing and publishing a piece.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
I typically apply these rules/conditions strictly, that’s why I
generally update my blog 1-3 times per month, sometimes less.
</p>
<p>
Ideas for articles may come from what’s currently being debated in tech;
some important product or innovation that’s been introduced; some
product I discovered and I’m satisfied with, which I feel I should
review to let more people know about it; some particular user interface
that’s worth talking about or criticising (be it the UI of an app, of an
operating system, of an appliance, etc.); more general themes regarding
technology and its impact on our lives; things like these. And I tend to
do my homework before speaking. I don’t like to just talk about
something because I feel I have to have an opinion on everything — like
a lot of people do today, sadly.
</p>
<p>
As for the writing and the tools, my workflow is rather simple:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The draft happens in <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>,
where I write in Markdown. I don’t usually write a first draft, then a
second, then a third and so forth. There is just one draft. I usually
start writing and adjusting my sentences as I write. Then I reach a
point where I feel I should leave the draft and go back to it later.
Then there’s more writing and adjusting as I write. Then I re-read the
whole piece, proofread, perform minor adjustments, have the
Text-to-Speech voice in Mac OS read the piece aloud, make more small
adjustments so that the article has a good flow, read the article again
another couple of times, and when it’s in its final state…
</li>
<li>
The article is then exported to HTML. I open it with
<a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a> and
remove all the superfluous markup.
</li>
<li>
The final step is copying the article’s text with the necessary HTML
entities and pasting it into
<a href="https://redsweater.com/marsedit/">MarsEdit</a>. From there, I
add categories, tags, an excerpt, and publish the piece.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the
physical space influences your creativity?
</h2>
<p>
Not really. Whenever I’m writing an article I want to publish on my
blog, I typically have a clear idea of what I want to talk about and how
I want to talk about it. I’ve written pretty much everywhere — though I
will admit I prefer to have a quiet environment around me. I write best
at home, at dead of night.
</p>
<p>
Also, the tools I favour for writing are pen and paper, and traditional
computers — sometimes even vintage computers, like one of my old
ThinkPads, or my 2008 black MacBook running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.
These are less distracting environments than iPads and iPhones for me.
</p>
<h2>
A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech
stack?
</h2>
<p>
Both the process of registering the website and providing Web hosting
were handled by a dear friend of mine on my behalf. So I don’t exactly
know where the domain is registered. Web hosting is provided by
<a href="https://bluehost.com">bluehost.com</a>, which I would say it’s
a pretty reliable service. I only experienced a couple of hiccups in
thirteen years. And as mentioned above, I use WordPress as CMS.
</p>
<h2>
Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do
anything differently?
</h2>
<p>
No, not really. Maybe the only thing I would do differently would be to
avoid free solutions and avoid publishing on Web spaces I don’t own. I
would start immediately with having a personal website, hosting, etc.
Which is the exact piece of advice I would give to anyone who wants to
start seriously blogging today. Use free solutions if you just want to
publish something online occasionally and don’t care much about owning
your identity. I still think WordPress is the best option because the
company has reached a ‘too big to fail’ level by now.
</p>
<h2>
Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does
it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some
revenue? And what’s your position on people monetising personal blogs?
</h2>
<p>
I currently have to pay for two registered domains, and the Web hosting
(which is shared between the two). The whole operation costs me about
€100-120 annually. My blog doesn’t generate revenue, apart from the
occasional donation, and what little I make by selling my two books of
short stories (advertised in the footer of my website). Since I have a
job, I don’t need to monetise my blog. Some people told me I should do
it anyway, because ‘you never know’, but I currently see no way to
monetise it apart from resorting to a) advertising, and b) putting some
content behind a paywall. And I hate both options.
</p>
<p>
I hate what advertising has become online. I hate that today if you want
a great browsing experience, you need to install all kinds of
ad-blockers. And I don’t want to subject my readers to all that crap.
You can visit my website with all blockers and trackers disabled,
there’s pretty much nothing going on in the background apart from some
basic WordPress analytics.
</p>
<p>
And since my blog is not a news outlet and I don’t have to pay anyone,
putting what I write behind a paywall makes no sense to me. I don’t want
to divide my audience into a privileged tier and a free-for-all tier.
Nor do I want to create special content for ‘patrons’ that is invisible
to everyone else.
</p>
<p>
Time ago I tried a new spin on a consolidated formula, and I called that
the <em>Small Fish sponsorship</em>. As I mention on the
<a href="https://morrick.me/sponsorship">relevant page</a> of my
website:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
…The spirit behind this is simple: I’m (still) a small fish compared to
other prominent tech-oriented blogs and websites, and I can’t offer
their kind of traffic or visibility. Thus what I ask in return is
relatively modest compared to those blogs. <em>[€450 for a week-long
slot]</em> Still, if a sponsor has a particularly compelling product to
offer, what I can provide is potentially more than just a mention and a
thank you.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It hasn’t had much of a success, so far, but I’m not complaining. I
thought it was an option worth offering. For now, I’m happy with the way
things are: I provide free content, and if you really appreciate
something I wrote, or you found it particularly useful or illuminating,
you can send a donation or purchase my books — they’re only $1.99 each.
</p>
<p>
Do I like people monetising their blogs and content? I guess it depends
on how they do it, what they offer, the quality of such content, and so
forth. As a reader, I tend to favour those creators who find a way to
monetise their content that doesn’t influence the content itself. I
mean, finding sponsors is great, but when your production is constantly
sponsored, I start wondering about your objectivity. I generally
appreciate those creators who manage to monetise what they do, what they
write, by clearly separating the content from the money. An easy
example: those who offer cool merchandise as a way to support them.
Perhaps it’s not the greatest way to make money, but if you write tech
reviews and you have a little e-store with t-shirts, mugs, desk
accessories, etc., it’s very likely that I won’t question your integrity
when I read the stuff you publish.
</p>
<p>
Another way to monetise content that’s quite popular today is to use
Patreon. It’s not a bad idea, but again, it depends on how the creator
embeds it in their production. Some people use it in its simplest form:
<em>Support me on Patreon. There are no particular perks, just different
tiers for support, from the bare minimum to fan-level support.</em>
Others do the same, but also offer some perks if you pick higher tiers
of patronage. I’m fine with these options. What I don’t like is using
Patreon as a way to basically paywall your content. Like those ‘free’
apps you download from the App Store, which are barely functional in
their free default state, and start being useful when you either make an
in-app purchase or, worse, activate a subscription.
</p>
<p>
If 90% of what you offer is a ‘secret’ unless people become patrons, I
can’t even evaluate how good (or bad) your stuff is without at least
paying you once (by becoming a patron for one month, then cancelling in
case I don’t like what I see).
</p>
<p>
There isn’t anyone in particular I’m supporting in the blog community on
a regular basis. But I have shown support for different people in
different ways at different times. By purchasing something via an
affiliate link. By purchasing an app if the blogger in question is also
a developer. By sending donations in difficult moments when the blogger
specifically asked for it. By purchasing some merchandise. You get the
idea.
</p>
<h2>
Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out?
And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?
</h2>
<p>
Over the years, I’ve become increasingly selective with whom I read.
There are a few prominent names in this short list, and chances are you
already know them or they’ve already been mentioned by people you’ve
previously interviewed. Anyway, here goes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Nick Heer’s <a href="https://pxlnv.com">Pixel Envy</a> is a great read.
I’ve been following Nick for a long time now. While at first his blog
and style resembled John Gruber’s a bit too closely, over time he has
found his voice, and the overall quality of his blog has kept
increasing. Very good tech commentary.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/">Michael Tsai’s blog</a> is another
must-read. He has perfected the art of presenting tech news and
assembling several different quotes from other writers as a way to offer
you all these perspectives and points of view on any given subject.
Sometimes he’ll chime in, too, but not always. This way you have a
general idea of how the debate is shaping up, and you can make up your
own mind without being influenced or pushed towards a particular point
of view.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other blogs I enjoy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Mike Rockwell’s <a href="https://initialcharge.net">Initial Charge</a>.
No bells and whistles, just straight honest thoughts.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://schwarztech.net">SchwarzTech</a> by Eric Schwarz,
another tech veteran.
</li>
<li>
Howard Oakley’s <a href="https://eclecticlight.co">The Eclectic Light
Company</a>. I’ve been reading Mr Oakley since the days of computer
magazines; he used to write articles for MacUser UK, Personal Computer
World, Mac Format. His blog has two main subjects: art, and the Mac
platform. His articles usually tackle technical (sometimes very
technical) aspects of Mac OS and are quite informative.
</li>
<li>
Jesper’s <a href="https://take.surf">Take</a> blog. He is such a private
person, and his blog has no personal info about him, so I only know him
as Jesper. But his blog is always a refreshing read. I’ve been reading
him for years and I can’t remember a time when I disagreed with anything
he said.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://reverttosaved.com">Revert to Saved</a>, by
<a href="https://craiggrannell.com">Craig Grannell</a>. A prolific tech
writer who contributes to sites such as Wired, TechRadar, Stuff,
Wireframe. Another enjoyable read.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://inessential.com">Inessential</a> by Brent Simmons.
Brent is the developer of NetNewsWire, the best RSS feed reader for Mac.
He doesn’t post often on his blog, but I always like when he does.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://joecieplinski.com/blog/">Joe Cieplinski’s blog</a>. Joe
is a developer and a musician, and a great guy. He used to write more on
his blog and I always loved to read his insights and points of view on
Apple and tech in general. I still think his blog is worth bookmarking
despite the scarce updates.
</li>
<li>
The only blog in Italian I’m currently reading on a fairly regular basis
is <a href="https://macintelligence.org">QuickLoox</a> by my friend
Lucio Bragagnolo. And I don’t just read him because he’s a friend, but
because he’s a very smart person and I enjoy reading his insights.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Picking a person from this list for your next interview is hard, as I’m
tempted to just tell you to try contacting them all. I’d give precedence
to Nick Heer, Michael Tsai and Lucio Bragagnolo if you haven’t
interviewed them already. They’re all busy people, but they’re also
approachable and amiable, so perhaps they’ll play along.
</p>
<h2>
Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?
</h2>
<p>
I’ll start with a little shameless self-promotion: I’ve written two
books of short stories, which I call ‘Minigrooves’. They’re available on
Apple’s Books Store and on the Amazon Kindle Store.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://morrick.me/minigrooves-short-stories">Basic info and
purchase links</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://morrick.me/archives/6304">More details</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://minigroov.es/">Official website</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I’m currently working on a science-fiction novel called <em>Low
Fidelity</em>, a project I started so many years ago. I’ve been working
on it for a long time, not because it’s a particularly monumental work
(although it’ll be comprised of more than one book), but because I’ve
alternated periods of intense inspiration and periods of low tide where
life and my main job took extreme precedence over it. You can read a bit
more about <em>Low Fidelity</em>
<a href="https://crosslines.wordpress.com/about-low-fidelity/">on this
page</a> at the <em>Crosslines/Low Fidelity</em> website. (That website
is a bit old and may contain outdated information, so navigate the rest
of it at your risk, haha).
</p>
<p>
With all this out of the way, here’s a brief list of books I recommend.
I won’t add any commentary, because otherwise this interview would never
end. It’s enough to say that these are all good food for the mind.
</p>
<p>
Fiction:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I’d recommend anything by Neal Stephenson, but I have a soft spot for
his early works, like <em>Snow Crash</em>, <em>The Diamond Age</em>, and
<em>Cryptonomicon</em>.
</li>
<li>
Truman Capote, <em>The Complete Stories</em>. Penguin Books have
recently published this collection of short stories, and I loved it.
Usually Capote gets recommended for his most famous works, like <em>In
Cold Blood</em>, <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em>, or maybe <em>Other
Voices, Other Rooms</em>. But with these short stories you really feel
how good of a storyteller he was.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Non-fiction:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Nassim Nicholas Taleb, <em>The Black Swan</em>
</li>
<li>
Jaron Lanier, <em>You Are Not A Gadget: A Manifesto</em>
</li>
<li>
George Orwell, <em>Essays</em>
</li>
<li>
Neal Stephenson, <em>In the Beginning… Was the Command Line</em>
</li>
<li>
Rick Edwards &amp; Dr Michael Brooks, <em>Hollywood Wants to Kill You –
The Peculiar Science of Death in the Movies</em> (Despite the grim
title, this is a really entertaining, smart, and nerdy book).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
While I may listen to specific podcast episodes if they come strongly
recommended, I’m currently not subscribed to any podcast. To be honest,
I don’t particularly like the medium, but it’s mostly a ‘me’ problem.
There are people who are capable of listening to podcasts while doing
something else. I can do that with music, but with the spoken word, it
gets complicated, especially for someone like me who has to
<em>read</em> and <em>write</em> a lot for work.
</p>
<p>
To properly enjoy a podcast, I would have to just sit and listen to it.
And many podcasts — particularly tech-oriented ones — are made of
episodes lasting well over one hour and a half each. I just don’t have
the time. I also think that it’s a bit disrespectful to commandeer the
audience’s time by producing extremely long podcast episodes.
</p>
<p>
I shall end my response and this interview with a short list of games
that I’ve found to be unique in one way or another. Everyone’s taste in
games is different, so I’ll just offer their titles and people can check
them out on their preferred platform (Steam, Epic Games, etc.). Not all
of these are available for the Mac, unfortunately:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Half-Life 2 (an oldie but an evergreen title)
</li>
<li>
The BioShock franchise
</li>
<li>
The Dishonored franchise
</li>
<li>
The Long Dark
</li>
<li>
INFRA↘︎
</li>
<li>
Disco Elysium
</li>
<li>
SIGNALIS
</li>
<li>
Kentucky Route Zero
</li>
<li>
Pacific Drive
</li>
<li>
All the Rusty Lake puzzle games
</li>
<li>
Alien: Isolation
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Thank you, Manuel, for contacting me and giving me the opportunity to
talk about myself and share all this information. All the best, and
let’s keep in touch!

of sick, starving pelicans found along California coast</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEWPORT BEACH, California — Scores of sick and starving pelicans have
been found in coastal California communities in recent weeks and many
others have died.</p>
<p>Lifeguards spotted a cluster of two dozen sick pelicans earlier this
week on a pier in coastal Newport Beach and called in wildlife experts
to assist.</p>
<p>Debbie McGuire, executive director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care
Center in Huntington Beach, said the birds are the latest group that
they’ve tried to save after taking in more than 100 other pelicans that
were anemic, dehydrated and weighing only half of what they should.</p>
<p>“They are starving to death and if we don’t get them into care, they
will die,” McGuire said. “It really is a crisis.”</p>
<p>It is not immediately clear what is sickening the birds. Some
wildlife experts noted the pelicans are malnourished even though marine
life abounds off the Pacific Coast.</p>
<p>Bird Rescue, which runs two wildlife centers in Northern and Southern
California, reported 110 sick pelicans in the past three weeks, many
entangled in fishing line or hooks. A similar event occurred in 2022,
the group said.</p>
<p>Wildlife organizations are focused on caring for the birds until they
can be released back into the wild.</p>

<h2 id="other-uses-of-a-car">Other uses of a car</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: Ed Summers blog, Inkdroid</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
He had come from a country where mathematics and mechanics are natural
traits. Cars were never destroyed. Parts of them were carried across a
village and readapted into a sewing machine or water pump. The backseat
of a Ford was reupholstered and became a sofa. Most people in his
village were more likely to carry a spanner or screwdriver than a
pencil. A car’s irrelevant parts thus entered a grandfather clock or
irrigation pulley or the spinning mechanism of an office chair.
Antidotes to mechanized disaster were easily found. One cooled an
overheating car engine not with new rubber hoses but by scooping up cow
shit and patting it around the condenser. What he saw in England was a
surfeit of parts that would keep the continent of India going for two
hundred years. <span class="citation" data-cites="Ondaatje:1992">(<a
href="#ref-Ondaatje:1992" role="doc-biblioref">Ondaatje, 1993, p.
188</a>)</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This description of the uses of a car, apart from transportation, really
spoke to me about how objects can overcome their intended use, and have
an unexpected second (or third) act, when you add human care and
ingenuity into the mix. Necessity is the mother of reinvention.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
For no easy to articulate reason I’ve found myself rereading <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ondaatje">Michael
Ondaatje</a> recently. His work was very important to me in my 20s, I
think because it was in vogue at the time, after he won the Booker Prize
for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English_Patient">The
English Patient</a>, and it was turned into a film (which won <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_English_Patient_(film)#Accolades">9
Oscars</a>).
</p>
<p>
He was born in Sri Lanka, spent his teenage years in England, and moved
to Toronto to study, where he finally settled. I was kind of wandering
in my 20s too, and I’m sure his writing appealed to me because it spoke
to that keen awareness of new places, being uprooted, and putting down
roots as best you could.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also found myself listening to some <a
href="https://pinboard.in/u:edsu/t:ondaatje/">interviews</a> with him
that are available on the web. In many ways these feel like a luxury
now, the web was still busy being born in the early 1990s. Hearing him
speak, and read from his work, lends a great deal of richness and depth
to his texts.
</p>
<p>
I think the thing I most appreciate about his novels are their poetic
quality (he’s an accomplished poet as well). You can read them
<em>slowly</em>. The chapters are sized perfectly, often being broken up
into shorter segments, that then divide into the paragraphs within. I’m
not in rush to finish, or get to <em>The End</em>.
</p>
<p>
His stories are told in intense, fluid detail, but in fragments that get
stuck together like a collage, with intentional gaps between them. These
narrative gaps invite you in to connect them–to participate in the
telling of the story. Ondaatje talks about the importance of collage in
some of his interviews. He famously starts with a very specific scene or
moment, and then grows the larger structure from it, like a generative
seed.
</p>
<p>
Another thing that came across in his interviews is how important
archival research is to his writing. He goes deep learning about a
particular topic, time, place of profession, which then infuses his
story. This of course appeals more to me now, after I’ve had a career
working in libraries and archives. Ondaatje texts have a way of
communicating this strange characteristic of surviving documents, and
even fragments of documents, to transport and change us <span
class="citation" data-cites="Harris:2002 Levy:2001">(<a
href="#ref-Harris:2002" role="doc-biblioref">Harris, 2002</a> ; <a
href="#ref-Levy:2001" role="doc-biblioref">Levy, 2001</a>)</span>. But
somehow he doesn’t do this by talking about documents explicitly. He
enacts them, and puts them to work, instead.
</p>
<p>
I lost track of him after 2000, maybe because I started reading less
fiction then, and became absorbed with work, which is something I regret
a bit. Note: keep fiction in your life. I did read <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anil%27s_Ghost">Anil’s Ghost</a>
recently, and I’ve got <em>The Cat’s Table</em> waiting on the top of
the pile on my bedside table. <em>Anil’s Ghost</em> is/was amazing. The
central character is a forensic pathologist. It’s about evidence, and
political violence, and love, and work, and … so many things.

<h2 id="us-senate-passes-bill-improving-air-safety-customer-service">US
Senate passes bill improving air safety, customer service</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The Senate has passed a $105 billion bill designed to
improve air safety and customer service for air travelers, a day before
the law governing the Federal Aviation Administration expires. </p>
<p>The bipartisan bill, which comes after a series of close calls
between planes at the nation’s airports, would boost the number of air
traffic controllers, improve safety standards and make it easier for
customers to get refunds after flights are delayed or canceled. </p>
<p>The bill passed the Senate 88-4. The legislation now goes to the
House, which is out of session until next week. The Senate is
considering a one-week extension that would give the House time to pass
the bill while ensuring the FAA isn’t forced to furlough around 3,600
FAA employees. </p>
<p>The bill stalled for several days this week after senators from
Virginia and Maryland objected to a provision that would allow an
additional 10 flights a day to and from the heavily trafficked Reagan
Washington National Airport. Other senators have tried to add unrelated
provisions, as well, seeing it as a prime chance to enact their
legislative priorities. </p>
<p>But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called a vote Thursday
evening after it became clear that senators would not be able to agree
on amendments to the bill before it expires. After the bill passed,
leaders in both parties were still working out how to pass an extension
and ensure the law does not expire on Friday. The House passed a
one-week extension earlier this week. </p>
<p>The FAA has been under scrutiny since it approved Boeing jets that
were involved in two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019. The Senate
legislation would govern FAA operations for the next five years and put
several new safety standards in place. </p>
<p>The bill would increase the number of air traffic controllers and
require the FAA to use new technology designed to prevent collisions
between planes on runways. It would require new airline planes to have
cockpit voice recorders capable of saving 25 hours of audio, up from the
current two hours, to help investigators. </p>
<p>It would also try to improve customer service for travelers by
requiring airlines to pay a refund to customers for flight delays —
three hours for a domestic flight and six for an international one.
 </p>
<p>In addition, the bill would prohibit airlines from charging extra for
families to sit together and triple the maximum fines for airlines that
violate consumer laws. And it would require the Transportation
Department to create a “dashboard” so consumers can compare seat sizes
on different airlines. </p>
<p>The FAA says that if the law expires on Friday, the 3,600 employees
would be furloughed without a guarantee of back pay starting at
midnight. The agency would also be unable to collect daily airport fees
that help pay for operations, and ongoing airport improvements would
come to a halt. </p>
<p>No one in “safety critical” positions — such as air traffic
controllers — would be affected if the deadline is missed, the FAA says,
and the safety of the flying public would not be at risk.</p>

<h2 id="haiku-isnt-a-beos-successor-anymore">Haiku isn’t a BeOS
successor anymore</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: OS News</p>
<p>So I got accepted into GSoC again! I’m going to be working on
WebKit2. But what is WebKit2, or even WebKit, for that matter? Well,
WebPositive uses WebKit to render its web pages. Currently, we use the
WebKitLegacy API to communicate with WebKit. It would be nice to switch
to the newer version: WebKit2. However, our port of WebKit2 still needs
work. At present, it has lost its ability to even render any webpage at
all! So, getting WebKit2 to work will be the primary goal of my GSoC
project. If there’s time left, I might be able to integrate it into
WebPositive. The advantages WebKit2 has for WebPositive will be mostly
invisible to end-users. The code will hopefully be more maintainable
than the deprecated WebKitLegacy and we’ll get access to several newer
APIs such as the ad-blocking API. Perhaps the most visible change:
problems in one part of the code should be less likely to crash the
whole browser. ↫ Zardshard on the Haiku website The current state of
WebPositive, the only native Haiku web browser, is emblematic of why I
have personally lost all interest in the successor to what is still my
favourite operating system of all time. Haiku OS supports several
browsers, and if you read any forum post about which browser to use, or
watch any of the enthusiastic Haiku videos by the insanely awesome
Action Retro, they’ll all advise you to use any of the non-native Qt or
GTK browsers instead – because WebPositive just can’t compete with the
ported, non-native browsers. Since everybody using Haiku is opting to
use the better ported browsers, WebPositive has fallen even more by the
wayside; now it has to play catch-up, and by the time WebKit2 has been
properly ported and bug-tested, and has been integrated into
WebPositive, which then has to be bug-tested as well, we’re going to be
months, if not years, down the line. In the meantime, the ported
browsers will have been regularly updated with newer, better versions.
Unless the focus for the single most important application of any
general purpose desktop operating system is placed solely on
WebPositive, it simply won’t be able to keep up with the ported
browsers. Why even work on WebPositive at all at that point? It’s not
like anyone is using it, so why bother? And this highlights a problem
for people like me, who prefer to have native Haiku applications instead
of ports of software I can already run elsewhere. As a former BeOS user,
I am not interested in a vessel for running Qt applications that I can,
in all likelihood, run better on Linux. Why would I go through the
trouble of assembling a machine with hardware Haiku supports, only to
then run the same applications I’m already running on Fedora or OpenBSD,
but worse? If you browse through Haiku Depot today, it feels like the
vast majority of modern, maintained, and working software are ports of
Qt (and GTK) software we already know and love from other, more mature,
more stable, more usable, and more feature-rich platforms. Haiku has
chosen to pour a lot of energy and manpower into becoming an operating
system designed to run ported, often Qt, applications, but the downside
to that is that new and maintained native Haiku applications, that play
to the strengths of the platform, are few and far between. A Haiku
developer once told me that real people use Haiku every day, and they
need real applications, and ported applications make it possible for not
only Haiku developers themselves, but also normal users, to run and use
Haiku every day. This is a valid argument that I fully understand and
agree with – it just means Haiku isn’t for me. And while that’s sad for
me, it’s entirely fine. Haiku’s developers have chosen to focus on
building a daily-drivable operating system with tons of ported
applications, instead of an ideologically pure operating system you
can’t really use because it only has like 4 native applications and
nothing else. And that’s a valid, smart, and practical choice that I
fully respect and understand, even if it means Haiku isn’t really a BeOS
successor anymore.</p>

<h2 id="building-lagrange-on-raspberry-pi-os">Building Lagrange on
Raspberry Pi OS</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: Robert’s Ramblings</p>
<p>These are my quick notes on building the Lagrange Gemini browser on
Raspberry Pi OS. They are based on instructions I found at
&lt;gemini://home.gegeweb.org/install_lagrange_linux.gmi&gt;. These are
in French and I don’t speak or read French. My loss. The author kindly
provided the specific command sequence in shell that I could read those.
That was all I needed. When I read the site today I had to click through
an expired certificate. That’s why I think it is a good idea to capture
the instructions here for the next time I need them. I made single
change to his instructions. I have cloned the repository from <a
href="https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange"
class="uri">https://github.com/skyjake/lagrange</a>.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install the programs and libraries in Raspberry Pi OS to build
Lagrange</li>
<li>Create a directory to hold the repository, then change into it</li>
<li>Clone the repository</li>
<li>Add a “build” directory to the repository and change into it</li>
<li>Run “cmake” to build the release</li>
<li>Run “make” in the build directory and install</li>
<li>Test it out.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you clone the repository you want to clone recursively and get
the release branch. Below is a transcript of the commands I typed in my
shell to build Lagrange on my Raspberry Pi 4.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>sudo apt install build-essential cmake \
     libsdl2-dev libssl-dev libpcre3-dev \
     zlib1g-dev libunistring-dev git
mkdir -p src/github.com/skyjake &amp;&amp; cd src/github.com/skyjake 
git clone --recursive --branch release git@github.com:skyjake/lagrange.git
mkdir -p lagrange/build &amp;&amp; lagrange/build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
sudo make install
lagrange &amp;</code></pre>
<p>That’s about it. It worked without a hitch. I’d like to thank Gérald
Niel who I think created the page on gegeweb.org. I attempted to leave a
thank you via the web form but couldn’t get past the spam screener since
I didn’t understand the instructions. C’est la vie. …</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-review-of-raspberry-pi-connect">A quick review of
Raspberry Pi Connect</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-10, from: Robert’s Ramblings</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi company has created a nice way to share a Pi
Desktop. It is called Raspberry Pi Connect. It is built on the
peer-to-peer capability of modern web browsers using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a>. The connect
service requires a Raspberry Pi 4, Raspberry Pi 400 or Raspberry Pi 5
running the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol)">Wayland</a>
display server and Bookworm release of Raspberry Pi OS.</p>
<p>When I read the <a
href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-connect/">announcement</a>
I wondered, why create Raspberry Pi Connect? RealVNC has works fine.
RealVNC even has a service to manage your RealVNC setups.</p>
<p>I think the answer has three parts. First it gives us another option
for sharing a Pi Desktop. Second it is a chance to make things easier to
use. Third if you can share a desktop using WebRTC then you can also
provide additional services.</p>
<p>For me the real motivator is ease of use. In the past when I’ve used
RealVNC between two private networks I’ve had to setup SSH tunneling.
Not unmanageable but certainly not trivial. I think this is where
Raspberry Pi Connect shines. Setting up sharing is a three step
process.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Start up your Pi desktop, install the software</li>
<li>Create a Raspberry Pi Connect account and register your Pi with the
service</li>
<li>On another machine point your web browser at the URL for Raspberry
Pi connect and press the connect button …</li>
</ol>

<p>washington — President Joe Biden welcomed the reigning WNBA champion
Las Vegas Aces to the White House on Thursday, celebrating what he
called a “banner year” for women’s basketball.</p>
<p>“It matters to girls and women, finally seeing themselves
represented,” Biden said during the celebration held in the East Room of
the White House. “It matters to all Americans. That’s why as a nation,
we need to support women’s sports.”</p>
<p>Both he and Vice President Kamala Harris were given the customary
jerseys from the winning team. As he held his up, Biden yelled, “Put me
in Coach, I’m ready to play!”</p>
<p>In her own remarks, Harris praised the team for playing with “such
joy” and being role models both on and off the basketball court.</p>
<p>“You simply inspire people across our nation and around the world,”
Harris said.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas Aces defeated the New York Liberty in the WNBA
championship last October to win their second consecutive WNBA title. As
he began his remarks, Biden made a not-so-veiled reference to his own
reelection prospects, noting, “I kind of like that back-to-back
stuff.”</p>

<h2>
The Scene
</h2>
<p class="drop-caps">
On Thursday, the top climate diplomats from the world’s two most
polluting countries are meeting in Washington, D.C. John Podesta,
America’s climate envoy, and Liu Zhenmin, China’s climate envoy, will
hold their first formal session and lay the groundwork for the United
Nations climate conference in Azerbaijan later this year. They will
discuss, among other topics, boosting climate finance and making further
cuts to methane emissions, according to
<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/us-china-climate-meeting-podesta" target="_blank"><em>Axios</em></a>.
</p>
<p>
Both men are new to their posts, with their predecessors John Kerry and
Xie Zhenhua having each stepped down in the past year. That could prove
important. Kerry and Xie could draw on their long personal relationship
in their negotiations: During the UN climate conference in Glasgow in
2021, their friendliness
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/climate/china-us-climate-deal-kerry-xie.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>seemed
to hold</u></a> the talks together.
</p>
<p>
Now, Liu and Podesta, who is also overseeing the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/john-podesta-tax-credits-schedule-hydrogen-sustainable-aviation-fuel-manufacturing" target="_blank">Inflation
Reduction Act’s implementation</a>, must forge a new bond. And they must
do so in an environment where vastly every climate-related issue —
electric vehicles, coal power, industrial potency, and trade — has
gotten caught up in the deteriorating relationship between the two
superpowers.
</p>
<h2>
The Backdrop
</h2>
<p class="drop-caps">
Does it make sense to talk about the economy, climate change, and
national security as separate issues anymore? Some of the same issues
that have complicated America and China’s political and economic
relationship — the former’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/solar-tariffs-us-china" target="_blank">rising
tariffs</a>, the latter’s alleged
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-china-climate" target="_blank">overcapacity</a>”
— are inextricable from their climate policies. In a way, the questions
that Podesta and Liu will confront all come down to one idea: What kind
of world can we all live in?
</p>
<p>
I recently attended the Hewlett Foundation’s Common Sense conference
outside San Francisco, a gathering of thinkers, scholars, and
journalists from the right and left who are trying to find a
“post-neoliberal” ideology, something to replace the dogma of free trade
and unfettered markets that has reigned since the days of Ronald Reagan
and Margaret Thatcher.
</p>
<p>
Rana Foroohar of the <em><em>FT</em></em>
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de1ae4d1-d9ac-42d7-8e70-f9630bb6b843" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>noted</u></a>
last year that the Hewlett conference aims to become a kind of
post-neoliberal “Mount Pelerin Society,” the midcentury ensemble of
economists, philosophers, historians, and business leaders who first
plotted what later became neoliberalism. I’m not sure about that — there
weren’t too many business leaders in California last month, and not
every attendee adhered to the post-neoliberal school of thought — but it
was a fascinating few days of discussion, and some big names, including
Rep. Ro Khanna and Sen. Chris Murphy, appeared onstage. (I was there to
moderate a climate policy panel.)
</p>
<p>
I agree with the central thesis, though: Look around and you can see a
new school of political and economic thought come into view. At its
best, this post-neoliberal ideology sees markets as one<em> </em>tool of
many to organize prosperity and human effort. Its adherents believe that
markets are created and organized by governments — and that, therefore,
governments have a right to shape markets to achieve more societally
harmonious ends.
</p>
<p>
Under Biden, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department
have investigated tech companies and blocked high-profile corporate
mergers, a trend that could continue under Trump. There is an emerging
bipartisan interest in industrial policy, even if Democrats and
Republicans can’t always agree on how it should be used. Biden is the
most pro-labor president in a generation, and even a few Republicans now
sympathize with unions. (Perhaps most importantly, last month the United
Auto Workers successfully organized a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/the-id-4-could-be-volkswagens-first-ev-made-with-u-s-union-labor" target="_blank">Volkswagen
factory</a> in the right-to-work South.) Lawmakers and officials talk
about the economy not as a self-balancing marvel, but as a set of
interlaced supply chains and industrial processes, which can sometimes
be managed at the source. The government can distribute vaccines,
subsidize solar panels, and contract for the production of heat pumps.
</p>
<p>
But at its worst, this new ideology seeks to seed the economy with
protectionist institutions in the name of political expediency.
Unconstrained, such a tendency could, for instance, degrade the American
car industry, filling the roads with bloated and expensive gas guzzlers.
It could make housing and healthcare even more expensive for Americans
while justifying new patronage networks, autarky, and the politicized
persecution of companies or industries.
</p>
<p>
Whether good or bad, though, something is coming. “I believe we’re in
the seventh inning stretch of consolidating a successor to
neoliberalism,”
<a href="https://hewlett.org/newsroom/jennifer-harris-rejoins-hewlett-foundation-as-economy-and-society-initiative-director/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Jennifer
Harris</u></a>, a former White House official who now runs the Hewlett
Foundation’s Economy and Society program, said at the conference’s
opening. Innings one through three were just about “jumping up and down
and saying the word <em><em>neoliberalism</em></em> a lot,” she added,
but now a more complete ideology is forming. Call it
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/29/opinion/biden-liberalism-infrastructure-building.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
liberalism that builds</u></a>,
<a href="https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/on_productivism.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>productivism</u></a>,
or something else: Policymakers are approaching the economy in a new
way.
</p>
<p>
And, well, cheers for that — not three, though. Maybe two. Here at
Heatmap, we try to cover that new way of thinking about economics and
society in part because climate change is a big force driving that
change in the first place. The challenge of decarbonization is leading
policymakers to think about the real economy in new ways. You can see
this in Biden’s approach to remaking the American economy: He has
rejected the old climate orthodoxy that governments should price carbon
and let the market do the rest in favor of a more experimental,
sector-by-sector scheme of tax credits, grant programs, and public
investments.
</p>
<p>
But I can only go so far in saluting this new paradigm, because the
other factor driving the change is the deteriorating geopolitical
environment. If the United States government is taking the reins of its
economy, that is because it fears what the Chinese government might do
in the near future. This anxiety, too, you can see across economic
policy. Under Biden, the government’s most forceful bipartisan
intervention in the economy — the CHIPS Act — stemmed from anxieties
over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Even the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law
<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/11/17/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-law-2/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
been justified</u></a> by citing the Chinese threat. Senator Joe
Manchin’s decisive support of the Inflation Reduction Act, too, was
rooted in the fear —
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self"><u>now
partly realized</u></a> — that China would dominate the clean-energy
future.
</p>
<p>
That must lend an air of melancholy to our post-neoliberal moment: If
economic policy is getting better, it’s because the world is getting
worse.
</p>
<h2>
The Stage
</h2>
<p class="drop-caps">
One more thought to complicate the Podesta-Liu talks: The two forces
driving this phenomenon — the urgency of decarbonization and the rise of
a menacing Sino-American relationship — coexist with great difficulty in
U.S. policy. But in China, they fit more easily.
</p>
<p>
Over the past few months, the American and European press have come to
terms with just how
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chinese-ev-cars-biden" target="_blank">exceptional</a>
China’s electric-vehicle and battery industries have become. This
advantage is due in part to China’s large consumer market and its
pre-existing proficiency at making electronics of all kinds. (China’s
top EV battery maker, CATL, was spun off of a Hong Kong-based company
ATL, which manufactured iPhone batteries.)
</p>
<p>
But policy has played a decisive role, too. China has subsidized its EV
industry far more generously than the U.S. or Europe, and its officials
have cracked down on internal-combustion vehicles to a degree not seen
in the West. Why have China’s leaders leaned so much into EVs? And why
has China become so skilled at manufacturing solar panels, wind
turbines, grid-scale batteries, and other essential decarbonization
tech?
</p>
<p>
The answer lies, in part, in its national security prerogatives. China’s
economy depends on oil, of which it has almost no domestic reserves to
speak of. It imports more than 10 million barrels of oil a day, and in a
hypothetical Sino-American conflict, the U.S. would move to cut off
China’s access. So it behooves China to invest in technologies that
reduce its dependence on oil and fossil fuels.
</p>
<p>
Now, is energy security the <em><em>only</em></em> reason that China has
embraced the energy transition? Of course not. Its political and
corporate leaders know that decarbonization presents a massive global
market opportunity. They know, too, that climate action is the
humanitarianism of the 21st century: It is one of the few things that a
country can do that seems to redound to every other country’s benefit.
</p>
<p>
But note that decarbonization plays virtually the opposite role in the
U.S. At least for now, we have vast fossil fuel reserves, while we have
to rely on imported minerals and materials to make EVs, many of them
from China. Decarbonizing, in other words, does little for our energy
security in the short-term — at least until sufficient mining and
refining capacity opens in North America.
</p>
<p>
This is just some of what Podesta must weigh as he sits down with Liu.
And it’s a good reminder: During the free trade era, climate was a side
issue that could be shunted to its own UN session. Now, in more ways
than one, it’s life and death.

US flags risks from illicit transfers of Iranian oil off Malaysia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR — A U.S. treasury official warned of environmental risks
from illicit transfers of Iranian oil off Malaysia, news portal
Malaysiakini reported on Thursday, as the United States narrows its
focus on financing for militant groups routed through Southeast
Asia. </p>
<p>The United States sees Iran’s capacity to move its oil as being
reliant on service providers based in Malaysia, a senior U.S. treasury
official said this week. </p>
<p>The official also said the U.S. was attempting to prevent Malaysia
from becoming a jurisdiction where the Palestinian militant group Hamas
could raise and transfer funds. </p>
<p>Brian Nelson, U.S. Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and
financial intelligence, said one of the main ways Iran raised money was
through the sale of illicit oil to buyers in East Asia, Malaysiakini
reported.  </p>
<p>“Many of these shipments traverse the waters around Malaysia and are
loaded onto vessels of questionable legitimacy that may also pose major
environmental and safety risks,” he was reported as saying. </p>
<p>Nelson expressed concern for any parties providing “ship-to-ship”
transfers of illicit oil as such maneuvers could lead to accidents or
oil spills that could threaten Malaysia’s coasts.  </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury has also seen an uptick in attempts by Iran and its
proxies, including Hamas, to raise and move money in Southeast Asia,
Nelson added.  </p>
<p>He urged those who wish to support humanitarian assistance to Gaza to
donate to reputable charities to ensure the funds were not diverted
elsewhere. </p>
<p>Nelson and Neil MacBride, Treasury general counsel, are on a visit to
Singapore and Malaysia this week to advance efforts in countering
financing and revenue generation by Iran and its proxies.  </p>
<p>The office of Malaysia’s prime minister did not immediately respond
to a request for comment. </p>
<p>But Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail said he conveyed the
country’s stance regarding sanctions to Nelson during a meeting on
Thursday. Saifuddin said Malaysia would comply with United Nations
sanctions but would not recognize unilaterally applied sanctions.  </p>
<p>He told reporters he also informed Nelson that Malaysia had
investigated and taken action against an organization with suspected
links to Palestinians. He did not name the organization.</p>

<h2 id="the-webs">The webs</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;We’re all familiar with the idea of the web, the www, the global network we pretty much all use daily. When we say “the web” we mean the whole thing, from the biggest of social platforms to the smallest of personal blogs. The web is cluttered, minimalistic, loud, and also quiet. It’s a cacophony, a hotchpotch of styles, ideas, and cultures. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU&quot;&gt;Bo described it well&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
A little bit of everything<br /> All of the time
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And in this eclectic mix, different people have tried to carve out
niches, in an attempt to separate some of that content from the rest:
<a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">the small web</a>,
<a href="https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web">the cozy web</a>,
<a href="https://foreverliketh.is/blog/the-personal-web/">the personal
web</a>, <a href="https://www.jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/">the slow
web</a>, <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/tech/quiet-web/">the quiet
web</a>. I find it interesting that all these have one thing in common
and that is the very humane scale of the vision. The bigger the web
becomes, and the more power we’re given, the more some people feel the
need to get back to a more intimate space, a space where things move
slower, where connections and interactions are given time to develop.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe I’m just projecting. Maybe it’s because that’s what I’m trying
to find here in this weird digital space I created for myself.

Trump, 18, to make political debut as Florida delegate to Republican
convention</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Miami, Florida — Former President Donald Trump’s youngest son, Barron
Trump, has been chosen to serve as a Florida delegate to the Republican
National Convention, the state party chairman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Republican Party of Florida chairman Evan Power said the 18-year-old
high school senior will serve as one of 41 at-large delegates from
Florida to the national gathering, where the GOP is set to officially
nominate his father as its presidential candidate for the November
general election. NBC News first reported the choice of Barron Trump as
a delegate.</p>
<p>Barron Trump has been largely kept out of the public eye, but he
turned 18 on March and is graduating from high school next week. The
judge overseeing Donald Trump’s hush money trial in New York said there
would be no court on May 17 so that Trump could attend his son’s
graduation. </p>
<p>Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Trump’s youngest daughter, Tiffany,
are also part of the Florida delegation to the convention taking place
in Milwaukee from July 15 to July 18.</p>
<p>“We are fortunate to have a great group of grassroots leaders,
elected officials, and members of the Trump family working together as
part of the Florida delegation to the 2024 Republican National
Convention,” Power said in an emailed statement.</p>

improves its application store, display mirroring, and more</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>As its first alpha release is closing in, we have another monthly
update about COSMIC, System76’s new Linux desktop environment written in
Rust. This month, they’ve further polished and shored up their
application store, imaginatively named COSMIC App Store, and it’s
supposedly incredibly fast – something I can’t say for its GNOME and KDE
counterparts, which tend to be so slow I’ve always just defaulted to
updating through the command line, mostly. The file manager now has
support for GVfs (GNOME Virtual file system) for making external storage
like USB drives work properly, and Greeter login screen, Edit text
editor, drag and drop, and copy/paste have been improved in various ways
as well. Theming has seen a lot of work this month, with support for
icon themes added to the App Library, fixed applet sizes, and more
tweaks, while light themes have been disabled for now to fix a number of
issues with colour selection being too dark. There’s also display
mirroring now, which even works when the individual displays have
different resolutions, orientations, and refresh rates. Pop!_OS is now
also being built for ARM64, which makes sense because System76 is now
also selling ARM servers. There’s also a bunch of work being done by the
community as the alpha release nears.</p>

windows in Linux with sockets, bare hands and 200 lines of C</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: OS News</p>
<p>X Server is slowly being deprecated in the Linux world and being
replaced Wayland. Still X11 is an interesting protocol to look at from
the perspective of binary communication and management of resource which
require fast speeds. In this post I tried to cover basic information and
create a simple but working app that is simple, defined in single file
and easily compiles. No external code except libc was used. I find it
fascinating when you can open black boxes and see how gears move each
other. ↫ Hereket As much as the time of X has come and is now finally in
the process of going, it’s still an incredibly powerful set of tools
that even in a bare state can do way, way more than you think. X has
come with its own window manager – twm – for decades, and it includes
several basic applications like xedit, xclock, xterm, xeyes. Twm is
actually pretty cool, and includes some features, like iconify to
desktop, that I wish still existed in modern desktop environments. It’s
quite bare-bones, though, and I doubt there’s anyone out there
unironically using it today. As the linked article notes, even without
advanced, complex libraries, toolkits, desktop environments, and so on,
it’s entirely possible to create fully functional windows and
applications with X. Of course, this makes perfect sense and shouldn’t
be surprising – it’s the X Window System, after all – but you so rarely
hear or read about it that you’d almost forget and just assume something
like GNOME or KDE is an absolute requirement to use X.</p>

is arriving to do one, simple task: put the apps users want in one place
to be found a Chromebook. While we have access to web apps, PWAs,
Android apps and Linux apps on Chromebooks, it’s not always clear how to
go about finding them. Should you install the web version or the Play
Store version? Which Play Store apps install a PWA versus an Android
app? Where should you go to find the right one for you? ↫ Robby Payne at

find applications, and this seems like exactly what’s happening

to start labeling AI-generated content as technology becomes more
universal</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — TikTok will begin labeling content created using
artificial intelligence when it’s uploaded from certain platforms.</p>
<p>TikTok says its efforts are an attempt to combat misinformation from
being spread on its social media platform.</p>
<p>The announcement came on ABCs “Good Morning America” on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Our users and our creators are so excited about AI and what it can
do for their creativity and their ability to connect with audiences.”
Adam Presser, TikTok’s Head of Operations &amp; Trust and Safety told
ABC News. “And at the same time, we want to make sure that people have
that ability to understand what fact is and what is fiction.”</p>
<p>TikTok’s policy in the past has been to encourage users to label
content that has been generated or significantly edited by AI. It also
requires users to label all AI-generated content where it contains
realistic images, audio, and video.</p>

The 10 corridors range from 12 miles to 780 miles in length. The public
will have 45 days to have their say on the proposals, and then the DOE
will narrow the list further. “In order to reach our clean energy and
climate goals, we’ve got to build out transmission as fast as possible
to get clean power from where it’s produced to where it’s needed,” said
John Podesta, senior advisor to the president for international climate
policy. “The Biden-Harris administration is committed to using every
tool at our disposal to accelerate progress on transmission permitting
and financing and build a clean energy future.”

<li>Climeworks opens new direct air capture plant
</h3>
<p>
In case you missed it: Climeworks opened its newest commercial direct
air capture plant yesterday. The Iceland-based facility, named Mammoth,
is not yet operating at full capacity, with only 12 of its planned 72
capturing and filtering units installed. When the plant is fully
operational — which Climeworks says should be sometime next year — it
will pull up to 36,000 metric tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere
annually. For scale, that’s about 1/28,000th of a gigaton. To get to net
zero emissions, we’ll have to remove multiple gigatons of carbon from
the atmosphere every year. “So in the context of where we need to go,
Mammoth is almost nothing,”

Heatmap’s new climate tech reporter Katie Brigham</a>. “But in the
context of our current reality, it’s nine times the size of the next

Orca. And it’s a major stepping stone towards the company’s ultimate
goal of capturing a million metric tons of CO2 yearly by 2030 and a

published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. The research pulls together
findings from nearly 1,000 previous studies on environmental damage to
paint a more complete picture of how humanity’s disruption to nature is
enabling the spread of pathogens – for humans, yes, but also for animals
and plants. It concludes that biodiversity loss, toxic chemicals, the
introduction of invasive species, and of course, human-caused climate
change, are all associated with “increases in disease-related end points
or harm.” Biodiversity loss was found to be particularly dangerous,
because it likely drives pathogens to evolve to target new and more
abundant hosts.

<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: PostgreSQL News</p>
<p>
The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all
supported versions of PostgreSQL, including 16.3, 15.7, 14.12, 13.15,
and 12.19. This release fixes one security vulnerability and over 55
bugs reported over the last several months.
</p>
<p>
A security vulnerability was found in the system views
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext.html"><code>pg_stats_ext</code></a>
and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-stats-ext-exprs.html"><code>pg_stats_ext_exprs</code></a>,
potentially allowing authenticated database users to see data they don’t
have sufficient privileges to view. The fix for this vulnerability only
fixes fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are created with
the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html"><code>initdb</code></a>
utility after this fix is applied. If you have a current PostgreSQL
installation and are concerned about this issue, please follow the
instructions in the “Updating” section for remediation steps.

For the full list of changes, please review the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/">release notes</a>.

<h2>
PostgreSQL 12 EOL Notice
</h2>
<p>
PostgreSQL 12 will stop receiving fixes on November 14, 2024. If you are

<h2>
Updating
</h2>
<p>
All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor
releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or
use <code>pg_upgrade</code> in order to apply this update release; you
may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and update its binaries.
</p>
<p>
For existing installations that are impacted by CVE-2024-4317 that wish
to remediate the issue, you will have to perform the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Find the SQL script <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> in the
<code>share</code> directory of your PostgreSQL installation (e.g. in
<code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>), or download it from the PostgreSQL
git repository from one of the URLs below. You will need to use the
script that matches your major version:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_16_STABLE">PostgreSQL
16</a>:

15</a>:
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE">https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_15_STABLE</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=blob;f=src/backend/catalog/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql;hb=refs/heads/REL_14_STABLE">PostgreSQL

</li>
</ol>
<p>
From the above URLs, you can click the URL that says “raw” to download a
version that you can copy and paste.
</p>
<p>
Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version.
If you do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only
PostgreSQL 14, 15, and 16 are affected) or your minor version is too old
to have the fix.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
In each database of the cluster, run the
<code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script as a database superuser. For
example, in
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html"><code>psql</code></a>,
with the file located in <code>/usr/share/postgresql/</code>, this
command would look like:
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<code>/usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
You must also execute this script in the <code>template0</code> and
<code>template1</code> databases, or the vulnerability will still exist
in databases you create later. To fix <code>template0</code>, you’ll
need to temporarily allow it accept connections. You can do this with
the following command:
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;</code>
</p>
<p>
After executing the <code>fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql</code> script in
<code>template0</code> and <code>template1</code>, you should revoke the
ability for <code>template0</code> to accept connections. You can do
this with the following command:
</p>
<p>
<code>ALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;</code>
</p>
<p>
Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run
additional post-update steps; please see the release notes from earlier
versions for details.
</p>

id="integrity-of-the-scholarly-record-isr-what-do-research-institutions-think">Integrity
of the Scholarly Record (ISR): what do research institutions think?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-05-09, from: Crossref Blog</p>
<p>
Earlier this year,
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/frankfurt-isr-roundtable-event-2023/" target="_blank">we
reported on the roundtable discussion event</a> that we had organised in
Frankfurt on the heels of the Frankfurt Book Fair 2023. This event was
the second in the series of roundtable events that we are holding with
our community to hear from you how we can all work together to preserve
the integrity of the scholarly record - you can read more about insights
from these events and about ISR in
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/categories/research-integrity/" target="_blank">this
series of blogs</a>.
</p>
<p>
Research institutions are one of the most important stakeholders in the
endeavour of research integrity, and any conversation around ISR is
incomplete without the views of this key community. This fact was
acknowledged at the second ISR roundtable event, and one of the main
takeaways from the discussions was to make more focused efforts to hear
the viewpoints of researchers and academics.
</p>
<p>
As the first step in this direction, we organised an online discussion
on the integrity of the scholarly record, to which we invited:
researchers and academics, research integrity experts based at academic
institutions, Crossref members, as well as other organisations working
on this topic such as COPE and Digital Science. The primary objective of
this event was to hear from this community their perspectives on
preserving and leveraging the integrity of the scholarly record and to
identify opportunities for collaboration in this area. To ensure common
ground, we also wanted to share information about Crossref metadata, the
Research Nexus vision, and our position and role in the integrity of the
scholarly record.
</p>
<p>
To facilitate this, the event started with an introduction by Kora
Korzec, Head of Community Engagement and Communication at Crossref, to
our <a href="https://www.crossref.org/about/" target="_blank">mission
and vision</a> and the importance of capturing the relationships between
the objects, people and places involved in research through the
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/" target="_blank">Research
Nexus</a>. Amanda Bartell, Head of Member Experience, was next and she
spoke about
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/isr-part-one-what-is-our-role-in-preserving-the-integrity-of-the-scholarly-record/" target="_blank">the
scholarly record and the role that Crossref plays in preserving the
record’s integrity</a>. In her presentation, Amanda emphasised that
Crossref’s role is not to assess the quality of content deposited by the
members but rather to provide infrastructure that enables the community
to provide and use metadata about the scholarly content produced by
members. It’s important not to put up barriers to entry, but to work
with all publishers to encourage best practices.
</p>
<p>
Dominika Tkaczyk, Head of Strategic Initiatives, shared details of a few
Crossref projects that focus on monitoring and improving metadata
completeness, thereby supporting ISR. These projects include improving
the Participation Reports, using metadata matching to discover new
relationships (e.g.,
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/discovering-relationships-between-preprints-and-journal-articles/" target="_blank">preprint
<em>published</em> as work</a>,
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/the-more-the-merrier-or-how-more-registered-grants-means-more-relationships-with-outputs/" target="_blank">work
<em>supported</em> by funder</a>, etc), and importing more retractions
and other updates from the Retraction Watch database that was
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/news-crossref-and-retraction-watch/" target="_blank">acquired
and made openly available by Crossref</a>. Dominika used these examples
to highlight the ways in which open and complete metadata can help in
uncovering large scale trends and systemic concerns. The final speaker
was Amanda French, <a href="https://ror.org/" target="_blank">ROR</a>
Technical Community Manager, who introduced the audience to the Research
Organization Registry, or ROR.
</p>
<p>
To accomplish the primary aim of the event, which was to hear the
community’s viewpoints, the participants were divided into breakout
groups for discussions and given three prompts to answer. The rest of
the blog is a summary of what we heard from the participants.
</p>
<h3 id="1-is-crossrefs-role-what-you-expected-what-surprised-you-what-are-we-missing">
<ol type="1">
<li>Is Crossref’s role what you expected? What surprised you? What are
we missing?
</h3>
<p>
An overarching sentiment from the academics in the audience was that
Crossref does so much more than is known to researchers! They were
surprised by the range of activities underway at Crossref. At the same
time, there were calls for Crossref to play a bigger role. Suggestions
included playing a leadership role in deciding which metadata elements
are a priority, providing guidance on the main metadata components
important for signalling trust, playing a greater role in connecting
various identifiers to ensure that relationships between different
content types are preserved well, and to coordinate the efforts being
taken by institutions, publishers and service providers around research
integrity, by virtue of Crossref’s unique position in the community.
There was a broad agreement that by providing the essential
infrastructure, Crossref acts as the base upon which other actors in the
scholarly community can build.
</p>
<h3 id="2-what-metadata-elements-do-you-consider-important-for-signalling-trust">
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>What metadata elements do you consider important for signalling
trust?
</h3>
<p>
Many participants spoke about the various ways in which author identity
and affiliation are important as trust signals. Being able to identify
when an author has changed institutions, or being able to make a
distinction between authors who have the same name is important. Author
affiliations that are authentic and verified would go a long way in
establishing trust.
</p>
<p>
Multiple assertions, e.g. for affiliations, would be welcome. The use
cases for this could be when research starts at one institution and is
carried over to another, or when researchers affiliated with an
institution may perform part of the research overseas. Some of the
participants, who actively investigate research data, shared that
abstracts are valuable because they can be used for large scale analyses
related to research integrity.
</p>
<p>
Other metadata elements that came up during this discussion were data on
peer review, ethics approval, patient and donor consent in medical
research, editorial boards (especially of special issues),
pre-registration, funding metadata, datasets and programming scripts.
</p>
<h3 id="3-what-value-do-you-see-in-the-integrity-and-completeness-of-the-scholarly-record-in-the-way-you-operate-how-do-you-contribute-to-it-how-can-it-support-you-to-achieve-your-own-goals">
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>What value do you see in the integrity and completeness of the
scholarly record in the way you operate? How do you contribute to it?
How can it support you to achieve your own goals?
</h3>
<p>
Participants acknowledged that integrity of the metadata and the
scholarly record is essential. Ensuring this integrity is a dynamic
process, much akin to the concept of organised scepticism which is the
notion that all scientific work should be trusted subject to its
verification. Several ideas were shared on how to progress the integrity
and completeness of the scholarly record. One recommendation was to use
multiple metadata trust markers as that can make it harder for bad
actors to game the system, but this may run the risk of making things
complicated. Another suggestion was to make metadata part of the
onboarding procedure- by gathering staff ORCID iDs during the onboarding
process and sharing the institutional ROR ID with staff to promote its
use, institutions can ensure that this information is routinely made
available. The metadata deposited with Crossref should be integrated
with downstream workflows to better facilitate the use of this rich
metadata. An example of this is to integrate Crossmark with other
research tools such as reference management software.
</p>
<p>
The participants acknowledged that this discussion underlined for them
the fact that having identifiers in itself is not an indicator of
quality and that the underlying metadata records and wider context is
key to understanding trustworthiness of the content.
</p>
<p>
This event was a good first step towards engaging researchers and
academics in the conversation about ISR. It connected folks working in
different parts of the world who are united by their interest in
research integrity. There was good engagement among all and commitment
to continue these conversations in the future, with many participants
planning to connect at the
<a href="https://wcri2024.org/" target="_blank">World Conference on
Research Integrity</a> in June (I’ll be attending as well, for anyone
who wants to continue the conversation - along with my colleagues
Fabienne and Evans).
</p>
<p>
At Crossref, we plan on continuing these conversations with all segments
of the community to understand their needs and perceptions around
metadata. The greater the awareness about the importance of metadata and
its applications, including for research integrity, the richer the
metadata that we are able to collect together. This will lead to
building a comprehensive Research Nexus and emergence of more
relationships therein. Please write in response to this post on our
Community Forum if you have any thoughts on this as we’d love to hear
from you.
