“Megalopolis” flop and Hollywood’s reluctance to take risks</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Marketplace Morning Report</p>
<p>
Legendary filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola’s latest work flopped at the
box office over the weekend. Coppola self-funded the film,
“Megalopolis,” to the tune of $120 million. Yet it made just $4 million
in its opening weekend. It’s the latest original film — one that’s not a
sequel or remake — to struggle to attract audiences to the theater.
Then, remittances to India top $100 billion a year.

<h2 id="freebsd-to-invest-in-laptop-support">FreeBSD to invest in laptop
support</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>FreeBSD is going to take its desktop use quite a bit more seriously
going forward. FreeBSD has long been a top choice for IT professionals
and organizations focused on servers and networking, and it is known for
its unmatched stability, performance, and security. However, as
technology evolves, FreeBSD faces a significant challenge: supporting
modern laptops. To address this, the FreeBSD Foundation and Quantum Leap
Research has committed $750,000 to improve laptop support, a strategic
investment that will be pivotal in FreeBSD’s future. ↫ FreeBSD
Foundation blog So, what are they going to spend this big bag of money
on? Well, exactly the kind of things you expect. They want to improve
and broaden support for various wireless chipsets, add support for
modern powersaving processor states, and make sure laptop-specific
features like touchpad gestures, specialty buttons, and so on, work
properly. On top of that, they want to invest in better graphics driver
support for Intel and AMD, as well as make it more seamless to switch
between various audio devices, which is especially crucial on laptops
where people might reasonably be expected to use headphones. In
addition, while not specifically related to laptops, FreeBSD also
intends to invest in support for heterogeneous cores in its scheduler
and improvements to the bhyve hypervisor. Virtualisation is, of course,
not just something for large desktops and servers, but also laptop users
might turn to for certain tasks and workloads. The FreeBSD project will
be working not just with Quantum Leap Research, but also various
hardware makers to assist in bringing FreeBSD’s laptop support to a more
modern, plug-and-play state. Additionally, the mentioned cash injection
is not set in stone; additional contributions from both individuals and
larger organisations are obviously welcome, and of course if you can
contribute code, bug reports, documentation, and so on, you’re also more
than welcome to jump in.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Treasury: Hydrogen tax credit rules will be done by the end of the

</h3>
<p>
The Treasury Department will finalize the long-awaited rules governing
the new clean hydrogen tax credit before the end of the year, Deputy
Secretary Wally Adeyemo
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/final-hydrogen-tax-credit-45v?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-83PRuVhXY2NBnmwd1PxtOOnYHFbcuGWRhdMlckHToWrQ_2t5JKwIsUIdrW3KfSZ_Ao6_cz" rel="noopener" target="_self">told

guidance for the

clean power</a> tax credits by that time, he said. That means that the
Treasury Department will have finished the rules governing most — but
not all — of the 18 tax credits created or remade by the Inflation
Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s signature climate package, by the
end of his term. More than two years after that law’s passage, many of
the potential beneficiaries — including electric utilities, battery
manufacturers, and more — are still waiting to find out exactly how to
collect its incentives.
</p>
<p>
The uncertainty has been especially paralyzing for the nascent clean
hydrogen industry, as the final guidance for the hydrogen tax credit,
section 45V of the tax code, could determine which multimillion dollar
projects ultimately get developed. Chief among the Treasury Department’s
concerns: It must decide how hydrogen producers who use electrolysis —
sending electricity through water to split its molecules — should deal
with the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-83PRuVhXY2NBnmwd1PxtOOnYHFbcuGWRhdMlckHToWrQ_2t5JKwIsUIdrW3KfSZ_Ao6_cz" rel="noopener" target="_self">indirect
carbon emissions</a> associated with drawing power from the grid. The
Treasury received more than 30,000 comments on the initial draft of the
hydrogen rules.
</p>
<p>
Though Adeyemo did not comment on the final rules’ substance, he called
those comments “quite helpful” and asserted multiple times during the
interview that the Treasury has found middle ground between the scheme
favored by climate advocates and a proposal more favored by the
industry. “Congress has provided a strong enough incentive here that
allows us to do two things at once, which is one, make sure that we’re
watching for significant indirect missions, but at the same time
creating pathways to do exactly what industry is talking about, which is
accelerating the development of the industry here,” he said.

</h3>
<p>
The death toll from Hurricane Helene has risen to 130 and hundreds of
people remain missing in cut-off mountain areas in western North
Carolina, where flooding and landslides swept away homes. Nearly
one-third of those missing are from areas surrounding Asheville. “The
devastation was beyond belief,”

the state’s governor, Roy Cooper. “This is something that’s never
happened before in western North Carolina.” More than 1.5 million
customers across six states remain without electricity and many in
Asheville do not have running water. President Biden is expected to
visit the state on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
Researchers at the Berkeley Lab put together a provisional attribution
report on the storm. “Our best estimate is that climate change caused

Tax Credit Rules Will Be Done by the End of the Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzcwODY3NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODIzODM5Nn0.n9eGjc5UIDOfPMudqbFYMvu0VbjnKv__QZemagiNpZ8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
The Treasury Department will finalize the long-awaited rules governing
the new clean hydrogen tax credit before the end of the year, Deputy
Secretary Wally Adeyemo told Heatmap in an exclusive interview Monday.
</p>
<p>
It will also publish the final guidance for the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/biden-ira-tax-credit-45x" target="_self"><u>advanced
manufacturing</u></a> and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/clean-electricity-tax-credit" target="_self"><u>technology-neutral
clean power</u></a> tax credits by that time, he said.
</p>
<p>
That means that the Treasury Department will have finished the rules
governing most — but not all — of the 18 tax credits created or remade
by the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden’s signature climate
package, by the end of his term. More than two years after that law’s
passage, many of the potential beneficiaries — including electric
utilities, battery manufacturers, and more — are still waiting to find
out exactly how to collect its incentives.
</p>
<p>
The Treasury hasn’t just been sitting on its hands. Adeyemo told us the
department has completed 75 guidance “projects” related to the IRA, a
category that includes proposed and final rules as well as some
non-binding FAQs and other documents. Citing
<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/inflation-reduction-act/impact-and-stories" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
analysis</u></a> from the Rhodium Group, an energy research firm, and
MIT, he said that the Inflation Reduction Act has already spurred some
$380 billion of private investment in 1,600 clean energy projects
nationwide, potentially creating 270,000 jobs.
</p>
<p>
“This is far out-performing what I think the initial expectations for
the law were at this stage,” Adeyemo said. “But as you also know, lots
of people want us to finish additional rulemaking.”
</p>
<p>
The uncertainty has been especially paralyzing for the nascent clean
hydrogen industry, as the final guidance for the hydrogen tax credit,
section 45V of the tax code, could determine which multimillion dollar
projects ultimately get developed. Chief among the Treasury Department’s
concerns: It must decide how hydrogen producers who use electrolysis —
sending electricity through water to split its molecules — should deal
with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/green-hydrogen-tax-credit-treasury" target="_self"><u>the
indirect carbon emissions</u></a> associated with drawing power from the
grid.
</p>
<p>
Under the scheme favored by climate advocates, would-be hydrogen makers
will have to build enough new renewable capacity to satisfy their energy
needs in close to real time. Under alternative proposals more favored by
the industry, producers could buy power from existing nuclear or
hydroelectric power plants that currently serve other customers, or
simply offset their emissions with solar energy certificates even if
they continue to operate when the sun goes down. Draft rules published
in December took a strict approach to emissions — and faced
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>fierce
pushback</u></a> not just from industry, but also from Democratic
members of Congress and the Department of Energy. Leaders of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hydrogen-hubs-biden-pennsylvania-california-texas" target="_self"><u>regional
clean hydrogen hubs</u></a> — which have been awarded grants by a
separate $7 billion federal program — argued that strict rules would be
fatal to their cause.
</p>
<p>
There is a lot of money at stake — up to $3 per kilogram of hydrogen
produced, equaling many billions over the lifetime of the program — to
build a new industry from near-scratch. Some energy modelers fear that
if the program is designed poorly, that windfall could subsidize a lot
of carbon emissions. Projects that are supposed to help the U.S. cut
emissions could end up creating them instead, these groups have
predicted,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>setting
the country back two to three percentage points</u></a> on its
greenhouse gas targets.
</p>
<p>
There are many other open questions about the hydrogen credit, including
requirements for
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hydrogen-tax-credit-final-methane-offsets" target="_self"><u>producers
that make hydrogen from natural gas</u></a>, instead of from water and
electricity. Although hydrogen companies made a flurry of new project
announcements right after the Inflation Reduction Act first passed, many
have since put those plans on hold as the industry awaits the final
rules.
</p>
<p>
The Treasury received more than 30,000 comments on the initial draft of
the hydrogen rules. Though Adeyemo did not comment on the final rules’
substance final rules, he called those comments “quite helpful” and
asserted multiple times during our interview that the Treasury has found
middle ground.
</p>
<p>
“Congress has provided a strong enough incentive here that allows us to
do two things at once, which is one, make sure that we’re watching for
significant indirect missions, but at the same time creating pathways to
do exactly what industry is talking about, which is accelerating the
development of the industry here,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Looming over these decisions is the upcoming election, when a change in
control of the White House or Congress could open up the rules to
review. Adeyemo acknowledged that the final rules were unlikely to
please everyone. But he said that he was “less concerned” about pushback
from Congress. He argued that the tax credit was lucrative enough that
companies could afford to abide by the requirements Treasury ultimately
sets, and that what the industry really wants is “clarity, certainty,
and flexibility.”
</p>
<p>
Companies and environmental groups on both sides of the hydrogen fight —
including the energy company Constellation, which operates more than a
dozen nuclear plants, and the Natural Resources Defense Council — have
already threatened lawsuits if the rules do not align with their
priorities.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-loper-corner-post" target="_self"><u>Recent
Supreme Court decisions</u></a> have weakened federal agencies’ ability
to defend their own rules in court. But Adeyemo said the department was
working hard to design the rules “in a way that is in keeping with
congressional intent,” to protect them from such attacks. “We’re now
going through the process of making sure that we show our work and how
we’ve done that.”
</p>
<p>
The other tax credit rules the Treasury plans to finalize, while still
consequential, have not left such foundational questions up in the air.
Companies have already begun building battery factories, for example,
under the expectation that they will be able to claim the advanced
manufacturing tax credit. The technology-neutral clean power credits
don’t even go into effect until next year, and the biggest uncertainty
is whether facilities that burn biomass or methane captured from
landfills for energy will qualify.
</p>
<p>
The news also leaves a few industries in the dark. Adeyemo said he
couldn’t commit to a timeline for finalizing a tax credit for low-carbon
aviation fuel, for example. Final rules for a tax credit for electric
vehicle charging equipment are also on the to-do list.
</p>
<p>
“The challenge, of course, is there’s only so many people here at the
Treasury Department who are doing all this work,” Adeyemo said, “so
getting through all the 30,000 comments on clean hydrogen and focusing
on that means that there’s going to be clear trade-offs.”

plans survey of devastation in North Carolina as Helene’s death toll
tops 130</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ASHEVILLE, N.C. — President Joe Biden was set to survey the
devastation in the mountains of Western North Carolina on Wednesday,
where exhausted emergency workers continued to work around-the-clock to
clear roads, restore power and cellphone service, and reach people left
stranded by Hurricane Helene. The storm killed at least 133 people and
hundreds more were still unaccounted for on Monday night, four days
after Helene initially made landfall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, election officials across the South were making emergency
preparations to ensure displaced residents would be able to vote in the
upcoming presidential election.</p>
<p>Officials in the hard-hit tourism hub of Asheville said their water
system suffered “catastrophic” damage that could take weeks to fully
repair. Government officials, aid groups and volunteers were working to
deliver supplies by air, truck and even mule to the town and surrounding
mountain communities. At least 40 people died in the county that
includes Asheville.</p>
<p>The North Carolina death toll included one horrific story after
another of people who were trapped by floodwaters in their homes and
vehicles or were killed by falling trees. A courthouse security officer
died after being submerged inside his truck. A couple and a 6-year-old
boy waiting to be rescued on a rooftop drowned when part of their home
collapsed.</p>
<p>Rescuers did manage to save dozens, including an infant and two
others stuck on the top of a car in Atlanta. More than 50 hospital
patients and staff in Tennessee were plucked by helicopter from the
hospital rooftop in a daring rescue operation.</p>
<p>How some of the worst-hit areas are coping</p>
<p>The storm unleashed the worst flooding in a century in North
Carolina. Rainfall estimates in some areas topped more than 2 feet (61
centimeters) since Wednesday, and several main routes into Asheville
were washed away or blocked by mudslides. That includes a 6.4-kilometer
section of Interstate 40 that was heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Joey Hopkins, North Carolina’s secretary of transportation, asked
people on Monday to stay off the roads.</p>
<p>“The damage is severe, and we’re continuing to tell folks if you
don’t have a reason to be in North Carolina, do not travel on the roads
of western North Carolina,” Hopkins said at a news conference. “We do
not want you here if you don’t live here and you’re not helping with the
storm.”</p>
<p>At an Ingles grocery store in Asheville, Elizabeth Teall-Fleming was
standing in line with dozens of others waiting to get inside and hoping
to find some non-perishable food, since they have no power. She planned
to heat up some canned food over a camping stove for her family.</p>
<p>“I’m just glad that they’re open and that they’re able to let us in,”
she said.</p>
<p>Teall-Fleming said she was surprised by the ferocity of the
storm.</p>
<p>“Just seeing the little bit of news that we’ve been able to see has
been shocking and really sad.”</p>
<p>In one neighborhood, residents were collecting creek water in buckets
to flush their toilets.</p>
<p>Others waited in a line for more than a block at Mountain Valley
Water to fill up milk jugs and whatever other containers they could find
with drinking water.</p>
<p>Derek Farmer, who brought three gallon-sized apple juice containers,
said he had been prepared for the storm but now was nervous after three
days without water. “I just didn’t know how bad it was going to be,”
Farmer said.</p>
<p>Helene roared ashore in northern Florida late Thursday as a Category
4 hurricane and quickly moved north. The storm upended life throughout
the Southeast, where deaths were also reported in Florida, Georgia,
South Carolina and Virginia. Officials warned that rebuilding would be
lengthy and difficult.</p>
<p>Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said Monday that
shelters were housing more than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper took an aerial tour of the Asheville
area and later met with workers distributing meals.</p>
<p>“This has been an unprecedented storm that has hit western North
Carolina,” he said afterward. “It’s requiring an unprecedented
response.”</p>
<p>Worries about the presidential election</p>
<p>Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State
Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday
that they are looking at options for voters in the hardest-hit counties.
She planned to provide more information at a Tuesday news conference,
including how someone could declare “natural disaster” as their reason
for not being able to provide a photo ID.</p>
<p>Election employees across Georgia returned to work even as some
offices faced power outages, limited internet and infrastructure
damage.</p>
<p>In Lowndes County, staff at the local board of elections were working
off of two computers instead of the usual eight, said election
supervisor Deb Cox. The office is also without wifi.</p>
<p>“We’re fully up and running as of this morning,” said Cox. “It’s just
slower than normal because we have less resources.”</p>
<p>In Columbia County, poll worker training will still begin this week,
said Nancy Gay, the county’s elections director, but she may have to
change the location because of the power outage.</p>
<p>“Our poll workers are being affected,” Gay said. “They don’t have
power. They don’t have gas. You’ve got to allow the workers time to
process everything and try and get a plan in place before I can really
expect them to come and show up for training.”</p>
<p>Mark Ard at the Florida Secretary of State’s office said the Division
of Elections is recommending that local elections supervisors reach out
to U.S. Post Office officials to discuss a mitigation plan for ballot
mailing, delivery, and return.</p>
<p>Why western North Carolina was hit so hard</p>
<p>Western North Carolina suffered relatively more devastation because
that’s where the remnants of Helene encountered the higher elevations
and cooler air of the Appalachian Mountains, causing even more rain to
fall.</p>
<p>Asheville and many surrounding mountain towns were built in valleys,
leaving them especially vulnerable to devastating rain and flooding.
Plus, the ground already was saturated before Helene arrived, said
Christiaan Patterson, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service.</p>
<p>“By the time Helene came into the Carolinas, we already had that rain
on top of more rain,” Patterson said.</p>
<p>Climate change has exacerbated conditions that allow such storms to
thrive, rapidly intensifying in warming waters and turning into powerful
cyclones, sometimes within hours.</p>
<p>Destruction from Florida to Virginia</p>
<p>Along Florida’s Gulf Coast, several feet of water swamped the
Clearwater Marine Aquarium, forcing workers to move two manatees and sea
turtles. All of the animals were safe but much of the aquarium’s vital
equipment was damaged or destroyed, said James Powell, the aquarium’s
executive director.</p>
<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said the storm “literally spared no one.”
Most people in and around Augusta, a city of about 200,000 near the
South Carolina border, were still without power Monday.</p>
<p>With at least 30 killed in South Carolina, Helene was the deadliest
tropical cyclone to hit the state since Hurricane Hugo made landfall
north of Charleston in 1989, killing 35 people.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Kirk forms and could become a powerful hurricane</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Kirk formed Monday in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and
is expected to become a “large and powerful hurricane” by Tuesday night
or Wednesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm was
located about 1,285 kilometers west of the Cabo Verde Islands with
maximum sustained winds of 95 kph. There were no coastal watches or
warnings in effect, and the storm system was not a threat to land.</p>

<h2 id="ibm-pc-5150-model-numbers">IBM PC 5150 model numbers</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: OS News</p>
<p>Recently I came across a minor mystery—the model numbers of the
original IBM PC. For such a pivotal product, there is remarkably little
detailed original information from the early days. ↫ Michal Necasek
Count me surprised. When I think IBM, I think meticulously documented
and detailed bureaucracy, where every screw, nut, and bolt is numbered,
documented, and tracked, so much so in fact this all-American company
even managed to impress the Germans. You’d expect IBM, of all companies,
to have overly detailed lists of every IBM PC it ever designed,
manufactured, and sold, but as it turns out, it’s actually quite hard to
assemble a complete list of the early IBM PCs the company sold. The
biggest problem are the models from before 1983, since before that year,
the IBM PC does not appear in IBM’s detailed archive of announcements.
As such, Michal Necasek had to dig into random bits of IBM documentation
to assemble references to those earlier models, and while he certainly
didn’t find every single one of them, it’s a great start, and others can
surely pick up the search from here.</p>

id="dockworkers-from-maine-to-texas-go-on-strike-risking-new-shortages">Dockworkers
from Maine to Texas go on strike, risking new shortages</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — Dockworkers at ports from Maine to Texas began walking
picket lines early Tuesday in a strike over wages and automation that
could reignite inflation and cause shortages of goods if it goes on more
than a few weeks.</p>
<p>The contract between the ports and about 45,000 members of the
International Longshoremen’s Association expired at midnight, and even
though progress was reported in talks on Monday, the workers went on
strike. The strike affecting 36 ports is the first by the union since
1977.</p>
<p>Workers began picketing at the Port of Philadelphia shortly after
midnight, walking in a circle at a rail crossing outside the port and
chanting “No work without a fair contract.”</p>
<p>The union had message boards on the side of a truck reading:
“Automation Hurts Families: ILA Stands For Job Protection.”</p>
<p>At Port Houston, which is in the Central time zone an hour behind the
East Coast, at least 50 workers gathered outside the port with signs
saying “No Work Without a Fair Contract.” They appeared poised to begin
picketing. Workers showed a statement from the ILA on the strike saying
that employers have refused to compensate workers fairly.</p>
<p>“The ILA is fighting for respect, appreciation and fairness in a
world in which corporations are dead set on replacing hard-working
people with automation,” the statement said. “Robots do not pay taxes
and they do not spend money in their communities.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, said Monday
evening that both sides had moved off of their previous wage offers, but
when picket lines went up just after midnight, it was apparent that no
deal had been reached.</p>
<p>The union’s opening offer in the talks was for a 77% pay raise over
the six-year life of the contract, with President Harold Daggett saying
it’s necessary to make up for inflation and years of small raises. ILA
members make a base salary of about $81,000 per year, but some can pull
in over $200,000 annually with large amounts of overtime.</p>
<p>But Monday evening, the alliance said it had increased its offer to
50% raises over six years, and it pledged to keep limits on automation
in place from the old contract. The union wants a complete ban on
automation. It wasn’t clear just how far apart both sides are.</p>
<p>“We are hopeful that this could allow us to fully resume collective
bargaining around the other outstanding issues in an effort to reach an
agreement,” the alliance statement said.</p>
<p>The union didn’t answer requests for comment on the talks Monday
night, but said earlier in the day that the ports had refused demands
for a fair contract and the alliance seemed intent on a strike. The two
sides had not held formal negotiations since June.</p>
<p>The alliance said its offer tripled employer contributions to
retirement plans and strengthened health care options.</p>
<p>During the day Monday, some ports already were preparing for a
strike. The Port of Virginia, for instance, was in the process of
ceasing operations. It accepted the last inbound train for delivery at 8
a.m., closed its gates to inbound trucks at noon and required ships to
leave by 1 p.m. Cargo operations halted at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>“We are handling this just like we would during the ramp up to a
possible hurricane,” Joe Harris, the port’s spokesperson, told The
Associated Press. “And we will bring it back online just as we would
recovering from a hurricane. We have an experienced team. We’ve done
this in the past.”</p>
<p>Supply chain experts say consumers won’t see an immediate impact from
the strike because most retailers stocked up on goods, moving ahead
shipments of holiday gift items.</p>
<p>But if it goes more than a few weeks, a work stoppage would
significantly snarl the nation’s supply chain, potentially leading to
higher prices and delays in goods reaching households and
businesses.</p>
<p>If drawn out, the strike will force businesses to pay shippers for
delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping
season — potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys or
artificial Christmas trees to cars, coffee and fruit.</p>
<p>The strike will likely have an almost immediate impact on supplies of
perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports affected by the
strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each year, or 75% of
the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm Bureau
Federation.</p>
<p>It also could snarl exports from East Coast ports and create traffic
jams at ports on the West Coast, where workers are represented by a
different union. Railroads say they can ramp up to carry more freight
from the West Coast, but analysts say they can’t make up the cargo
handled to the east.</p>
<p>“If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the
supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and
cause chaos across the industry,” noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply
chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan estimated that a strike that shuts down East and Gulf
coast ports could cost the economy $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion per day,
with some of that recovered over time after normal operations
resume.</p>
<p>The strike comes just weeks before the presidential election and
could become a factor if there are shortages. Retailers, auto parts
suppliers and produce importers had hoped for a settlement or that
President Joe Biden would intervene and end the strike using the
Taft-Hartley Act, which allows him to seek an 80-day cooling off
period.</p>
<p>But during an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden, who has
worked to court union votes for Democrats, said “no” when asked if he
planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage.</p>
<p>A White House official said Monday that at Biden’s direction, the
administration has been in regular communication with the ILA and the
alliance to keep the negotiations moving forward. The president directed
Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael
Brainard to convene the alliance’s board members Monday afternoon and
urge them to resolve the dispute fairly and quickly — in a way that
accounts for the success of shipping companies in recent years and
contributions of union workers.</p>

id="exclusive-africom-chief-says-islamic-state-doubles-size-in-north-somalia">Exclusive:
AFRICOM Chief says Islamic State doubles size in north Somalia</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PENTAGON — Islamic State in Somalia has approximately doubled in size
over the past year, the chief of U.S. Africa Command told VOA.</p>
<p>“I am concerned about the northern part of Somalia and ISIS growing
in numbers,” AFRICOM commander Gen. Michael Langley said in an exclusive
interview, using an acronym for the terror group.</p>
<p>Langley declined to provide the United States’ estimate of how many
Islamic State fighters are in Somalia, other than to say that the
group’s had grown about “twofold” in the past year. Previous estimates
have put the number of Islamic State fighters in north Somalia at about
200 fighters.</p>
<p>The AFRICOM commander also warned about the possibility of Islamic
State increasing its foreign fighter presence in Somalia. </p>
<p>Somali Brigadier General Abdi Hassan Hussein, the former intelligence
and police commander of Puntland, where Islamic State is located in the
north, told VOA earlier this year that the number of Islamic State
foreign fighters there alone is estimated in the hundreds. This figure
has yet to be confirmed by local authorities.</p>
<p>A U.S. official told VOA in June that Abdulqadir Mumin, the leader of
Islamic State in Somalia, had been targeted in an American airstrike in
May. Mumin appears to have survived the strike. </p>
<p>Asked whether Mumin was now the global leader of IS, Langley said the
U.S. must take those reports as “credible.”</p>
<p>“ISIS professes that. Sometimes you’ve got to take that seriously,”
he said.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab </p>
<p>The increase in Islamic State fighters in northern Somalia comes as
the al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabab has exploited diplomatic disagreements
between Somalia and Ethiopia to raise its recruitment numbers. </p>
<p>Landlocked Ethiopia and Somalia’s breakaway Somaliland region signed
a memorandum of understanding earlier this year to use its Red Sea port
of Berbera, a deal that Somalia has rejected. Somali Prime Minister
Hamza Abdi Barre on Friday accused Ethiopia, before the U.N. General
Assembly, of actions that “flagrantly violate” Somalia’s territorial
integrity.</p>
<p>“The have used that (dispute) to their advantage,” Langley told
VOA.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab has been back at high numbers of between 12,000 to 13,000
fighters due to strong financing and heavy recruitment efforts, senior
defense officials told VOA in June.</p>
<p>The political rift has bled into counter-terror cooperation between
Addis Ababa and Mogadishu, with Langley telling VOA that Somali
operations with Ethiopia have been “limited.”</p>
<p>“Time will tell if they can settle their differences and coalesce
into a force that’s very effective, because when they do work together,
they’re very, very effective at clearing out al-Shabab.’’</p>
<p>Al-Shabab has continued attacks on civilians, including in the
Mogadishu area. The terror group claimed responsibility for a gun attack
and suicide bombing that killed at least 32 people in August on a
popular beach in the Somalia’s capital. The group is also suspected to
have carried out two deadly bombings on Saturday, one in Middle Shabelle
region and another about one kilometer from the president’s office.</p>
<p>Al-Shabab has suffered defeats from the South West State of Somalia
down to the Juba River Valley and has sought to reset and counter-attack
in those areas.</p>
<p>However, in central Somalia, al-Shabab has reversed gains made by
Somali forces over the last two years as government forces failed to
hold the terrain they had retaken, according to senior U.S. defense
officials. </p>
<p>“We need a credible holding force, because sometimes shadow
governments of al-Shabaab try to re-insert themselves back in that
region and try to influence some of the local leaders,” Langley
said. </p>
<p>He said the time following the clearing and liberating of a region is
a “very fragile period” where Somalia and partners like the U.S. Agency
for International Development can initiate local services that will
increase the population’s faith in the federal government.</p>
<p>“If they can’t sustain that because they’re moving to the next region
or next district, it ebbs,” he said, adding that U.S. training was
currently focused on helping Somali forces hold liberated terrain.</p>
<p>The Somali government has pointed to the El Dheer and Harardhere
areas as evidence that some liberated terrain in central Somalia remains
under government control.</p>
<p>ATMIS transition</p>
<p>Later this year, the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia will
leave the country after nearly two years of helping Somalia fight
al-Shabab terrorists and will be replaced in 2025 by a new African Union
Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia. Which forces will be
comprised in the mission is still being worked out by the African Union
and the United Nations.</p>
<p>Langley ruled out any U.S. role in the transition, saying American
forces would maintain only their advise-and-assist mission.</p>
<p>“Our piece of enabling is not our boots on the ground. We’re there to
advise and assist, and assist in their training, but the fight is
theirs,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Houthis</p>
<p>In addition to Islamic State and al-Shabab, Somalia also must worry
about Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, just north of Somalia
across the Gulf of Aden, whom Langley says have “aspirations” to
collaborate with al-Shabab.</p>
<p>“We’re concerned, and we’re closely watching that, because this can
turn into a bad neighborhood real quick,” he said.</p>
<p>Should the Houthis and al-Shabab put pressure on the Gulf of Aden
from opposite sides, Langley worries that squeezing this strategic choke
point could further hinder the free flow of commerce and affect the
global economy. And analysts fear that Houthis could insert more
sophisticated weapons into the fight for Somalia.</p>
<p>Houthi militants have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with
missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October, seizing
one, sinking two and killing at least four sailors. Other missiles and
drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red
Sea or failed to reach their targets.</p>
<p>The Houthi militant campaign began after Israel launched a
retaliatory attack against Hamas in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7
terror attack, and the Houthis claim they are acting in solidarity with
Palestinians during the war.</p>

id="fbi-to-pay-22m-to-settle-claims-of-sexual-discrimination-at-training-academy">FBI
to pay $22M to settle claims of sexual discrimination at training
academy</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The FBI agreed Monday to pay more than $22 million to
settle a class-action lawsuit alleging female recruits were singled out
for dismissal in training and routinely harassed by instructors with
sexually charged comments about their breast size, false allegations of
infidelity and the need to take contraception “to control their
moods.”</p>
<p>The payout to 34 women dismissed from the FBI’s training academy in
Quantico, Virginia — still subject to approval by a federal judge —
would rank among the biggest lawsuit settlements in the history of the
bureau.</p>
<p>“These problems are pervasive within the FBI and the attitudes that
created them were learned at the academy,” said David J. Shaffer, the
lawyer for the women. “This case will make important major changes in
these attitudes.”</p>
<p>Filed in 2019, the lawsuit contends that female recruits had been
subjected to a hostile working environment in which they were judged
more harshly than their male peers and “excessively targeted for
correction and dismissal in tactical situations for perceived lack of
judgment” and subjective “suitability.”</p>
<p>One of the women said she was admonished to “smile more” and
subjected to repeated sexual advances. Another said an instructor leered
at her and stared at her chest, “sometimes while licking his lips.”</p>
<p>“Through passive tolerance,” the lawsuit said, “the FBI has
intentionally allowed the Good Old Boy Network to flourish unrestrained
at the FBI Academy.”</p>
<p>The FBI said in a statement Monday that the bureau has “taken
significant steps over the past five years to further ensure gender
equity in the training and development of all our trainees.”</p>
<p>Many of the allegations in the lawsuit were confirmed in a 2022
internal watchdog report. Men still make up some three-quarters of the
bureau’s special agents despite efforts to diversify in recent
years.</p>
<p>Among the provisions of the settlement was that the FBI would offer
the plaintiffs a chance to continue training toward becoming agents,
with “guaranteed placement” for those who pass in one of their top three
preferred field offices. The bureau also has agreed to a review by
outside experts who will work to ensure that female recruits face a fair
evaluation process.</p>
<p>Some of the women have moved on to other careers, Shaffer said,
adding “the FBI has deprived itself of some genuinely exceptional
talent.”</p>
<p>Paula Bird, a lead plaintiff in the case who is now a lawyer, said
that while the experience has been “disillusioning,” she was “pleased
that this settlement will bring a measure of justice to the women who
were unfairly dismissed.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit came amid a flurry of sexual misconduct claims within the
bureau that included several against senior FBI officials identified in
an Associated Press investigation who quietly left the bureau with full
benefits even after allegations against them were substantiated. Those
claims ranged from unwanted touching and advances to coercion. In one
case, an FBI assistant director retired after the inspector general’s
office concluded he harassed a female subordinate and sought an improper
relationship with her.</p>
<p>In response to AP’s reporting, the FBI announced a series of reforms,
including a 24/7 tip line, intended to take a tougher stand against
agents found to have committed misconduct and help accusers.</p>
<p>The latest settlement comes less than six months after the Justice
Department announced a $138.7 million settlement with more than 100
people who accused the FBI of grossly mishandling allegations of sexual
assault against the sports doctor Larry Nassar.</p>

<h2 id="pete-rose-baseballs-banned-hits-leader-has-died-at-age-83">Pete
Rose, baseball’s banned hits leader, has died at age 83</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-01, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — Pete Rose, baseball’s career hits leader and fallen idol
who undermined his historic achievements and Hall of Fame dreams by
gambling on the game he loved and once embodied, has died. He was
83.</p>
<p>Stephanie Wheatley, a spokesperson for Clark County in Nevada,
confirmed on behalf of the medical examiner that Rose died Monday.
Wheatley said the cause and manner of death had not yet been
determined.</p>
<p>For fans who came of age in the 1960s and ‘70s, no player was more
exciting than the Cincinnati Reds’ No. 14, “Charlie Hustle,” the brash
superstar with the shaggy hair, puggish nose and muscular forearms. At
the dawn of artificial surfaces, divisional play and free agency, Rose
was old school, a conscious throwback to baseball’s early days. Millions
could never forget him crouched and scowling at the plate, running full
speed to first even after drawing a walk, or sprinting for the next base
and diving headfirst into the bag.</p>
<p>A 17-time All-Star, the switch-hitting Rose played on three World
Series winners. He was the National League MVP in 1973 and World Series
MVP two years later. He holds the major league record for games played
(3,562) and plate appearances (15,890) and the NL record for the longest
hitting streak (44). He was the leadoff man for one of baseball’s most
formidable lineups with the Reds’ championship teams of 1975 and 1976,
with teammates that included Hall of Famers Johnny Bench, Tony Perez and
Joe Morgan.</p>
<p>But no milestone approached his 4,256 hits, breaking his hero Ty
Cobb’s 4,191 and signifying his excellence no matter the notoriety that
followed. It was a total so extraordinary that you could average 200
hits for 20 years and still come up short. Rose’s secret was
consistency, and longevity. Over 24 seasons, all but six played entirely
with the Reds, Rose had 200 hits or more 10 times, and more than 180
four other times. He batted .303 overall, even while switching from
second base to outfield to third to first, and he led the league in hits
seven times.</p>
<p>“Every summer, three things are going to happen,” Rose liked to say,
“the grass is going to get green, the weather is going to get hot, and
Pete Rose is going to get 200 hits and bat .300.”</p>
<p>Rose was Rookie of the Year in 1963, but he started off 0 for 12 with
three walks and a hit by pitch before getting his first major league
hit, an eighth-inning triple off Pittsburgh’s Bob Friend. It came in
Cincinnati on April 13, 1963, the day before Rose’s 22nd birthday. He
reached 1,000 in 1968, 2,000 just five years later and 3,000 just five
years after that.</p>
<p>He moved into second place, ahead of Hank Aaron, with hit No. 3,772,
in 1982. No. 4,000 was off the Phillies’ Jerry Koosman in 1984, exactly
21 years to the day after his first hit. He caught up with Cobb on
Sept. 8, 1985, and surpassed him three days later, in Cincinnati, with
Rose’s mother and teenage son, Pete Jr., among those in attendance.</p>
<p>Rose was 44 and the team’s player-manager. Batting left-handed
against the San Diego Padres’ Eric Show in the first inning, he smacked
a 2-1 slider into left field, a clean single. The crowd of 47,000-plus
stood and yelled. The game was halted to celebrate. Rose was given the
ball and the first base bag, then wept openly on the shoulder of first
base coach and former teammate, Tommy Helms.</p>
<p>Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, watching from New York,
declared that Rose had “reserved a prominent spot in Cooperstown.” After
the game, a 2-0 win for the Reds in which Rose scored both runs, he
received a phone call from President Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>“Your reputation and legacy are secure,” Reagan told him. “It will be
a long time before anyone is standing in the spot where you’re standing
now.”</p>
<p>Four years later, he was gone.</p>
<p>On March 20, 1989, Ueberroth (who would soon be succeeded by A.
Bartlett Giamatti) announced that his office was conducting a “full
inquiry into serious allegations” about Rose. Reports emerged that he
had been relying on a network of bookies and friends and others in the
gambling world to place bets on baseball games, including some with the
Reds. Rose denied any wrongdoing, but the investigation found that the
“accumulated testimony of witnesses, together with the documentary
evidence and telephone records reveal extensive betting activity by Pete
Rose in connection with professional baseball and, in particular,
Cincinnati Reds games, during the 1985, 1986, and 1987 baseball
seasons.”</p>
<p>Betting on baseball had been a primal sin since 1920, when several
members of the Chicago White Sox were expelled for throwing the 1919
World Series — to the Cincinnati Reds. Baseball’s Rule 21, posted in
every professional clubhouse, proclaims that “Any player, umpire or club
or league official or employee who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any
baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform
shall be declared permanently ineligible.’’</p>
<p>As far back as the 1970s, Bench and others had worried about Rose. By
all accounts, he never bet against his own team, but even betting on the
Reds left himself open to blackmail and raised questions about whether a
given managerial decision was based on his own financial interest.</p>
<p>In August 1989, at a New York press conference, Giamatti spoke some
of the saddest words in baseball history: “One of the game’s greatest
players has engaged in a variety of acts which have stained the game,
and he must now live with the consequences of those acts.” Giamatti
announced that Rose had agreed to a lifetime ban from baseball, a
decision that in 1991 the Hall of Fame would rule left him ineligible
for induction. Rose attempted to downplay the news, insisting that he
had never bet on baseball and that he would eventually be
reinstated.</p>
<p>Within weeks of his announcement, Giamatti was dead from a heart
attack. But the ban remained in place and Rose never made it to the Hall
in his lifetime, although he did receive 41 votes in 1992 (when 323
votes were needed), around the time the Hall formally ruled that those
banned from the game could never be elected. His status was long
debated. Rose’s supporters including Donald Trump, who in 2015, the year
before he was elected president, tweeted: “Can’t believe Major League
Baseball just rejected <span class="citation"
data-cites="PeteRose_14">@PeteRose_14</span> for the Hall of Fame. He’s
paid the price. So ridiculous — let him in!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his story changed. In a November 1989 memoir, written with
“The Boys of Summer” author Roger Kahn, Rose again claimed innocence,
only to reverse himself in 2004. He desperately wanted to come back, and
effectively destroyed his chances. He would continue to spend time at
casinos, insisting he was there for promotion, not gambling. He believed
he had “messed up” and that his father would have been ashamed, but he
still bet on baseball, albeit legally.</p>
<p>“I don’t think betting is morally wrong. I don’t even think betting
on baseball is morally wrong,” he wrote in “Play Hungry,” a memoir
released in 2019. “There are legal ways, and there are illegal ways, and
betting on baseball the way I did was against the rules of
baseball.”</p>

id="us-port-strike-by-45000-dockworkers-is-all-but-certain-to-begin-at-midnight">US
port strike by 45,000 dockworkers is all but certain to begin at
midnight</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — The union representing U.S. dockworkers has signaled that
45,000 of its members will walk off the job at midnight, kicking off a
strike likely to shut down ports across the East and Gulf coasts.</p>
<p>The coming work stoppage threatens to significantly snarl the
nation’s supply chain, potentially leading to higher prices and delays
in goods reaching households and businesses if it drags on for weeks.
That’s because the strike by members of the International Longshoremen’s
Association could cause 36 ports — which handle roughly half of the
goods shipped into and out of the U.S. — to shutter operations.</p>
<p>ILA confirmed over the weekend that its members would hit the picket
lines at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday. In a Monday update, the union blamed the
United States Maritime Alliance, which represents the ports, for
continuing to “to block the path” toward an agreement before the
contract deadline. </p>
<p>“The Ocean Carriers represented by USMX want to enjoy rich
billion-dollar profits that they are making in 2024, while they offer
ILA Longshore Workers an unacceptable wage package that we reject,” ILA
said in a prepared statement. “ILA longshore workers deserve to be
compensated for the important work they do keeping American commerce
moving and growing.” </p>
<p>ILA also accused the shippers of “gouging their customers” with
sizeable price increases for containers over recent weeks. The union
said that this will result in increased costs for American
consumers. </p>
<p>The Associated Press reached out to a USMX spokesperson for
comment. </p>
<p>If drawn out, the strike would force businesses to pay shippers for
delays and cause some goods to arrive late for peak holiday shopping
season — potentially impacting delivery of anything from toys or
artificial Christmas trees, to cars, coffee and fruit. </p>
<p>A strike could have an almost immediate impact on supplies of
perishable imports like bananas, for example. The ports that could be
affected by the strike handle 3.8 million metric tons of bananas each
year, or 75% of the nation’s supply, according to the American Farm
Bureau Federation. </p>
<p>Americans could also face higher prices as retailers feel the supply
squeeze. </p>
<p>“If the strikes go ahead, they will cause enormous delays across the
supply chain, a ripple effect which will no doubt roll into 2025 and
cause chaos across the industry,” noted Jay Dhokia, founder of supply
chain management and logistics firm Pro3PL. </p>
<p>Dhokia added that East Coast ports aren’t the only ones at risk for
disruption, as concern leading up to the strike has already diverted
many shipments out West, adding to route congestion and more pressure on
demand. Impacts will also be felt internationally — particularly in
places like the United Kingdom, he said, where the U.S. is its largest
trading partner. </p>
<p>ILA members are demanding higher wages and a total ban on the
automation of cranes, gates and container-moving trucks used in the
loading or unloading of freight. </p>
<p>The coming strike by the ILA workers — set to impact ports from Maine
to Texas — will be the first by the union since 1977. West Coast
dockworkers belong to a different union and aren’t involved in the
strike. </p>
<p>If a strike were deemed a danger to U.S. economic health, President
Joe Biden could, under the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, seek a court order for
an 80-day cooling-off period. That would suspend the strike. </p>
<p>All eyes are on what, if any, action the administration might take —
particularly just weeks ahead of a tight presidential election. But
Biden has signaled that he will not exercise this power. </p>
<p>During an exchange with reporters on Sunday, Biden said “no” when
asked if he planned to intervene in the potential work stoppage. </p>
<p>“Because it’s collective bargaining, I don’t believe in
Taft-Hartley,” he said. </p>
<p>At a briefing Monday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre
reiterated that the administration had never invoked Taft-Hartley “to
break a strike and are not considering doing so now.” She added that top
officials were still urging both parties to return to the bargaining
table and negotiate in good faith.</p>

id="arkansas-sues-youtube-over-claims-its-fueling-mental-health-crisis">Arkansas
sues YouTube over claims it’s fueling mental health crisis</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>little rock, arkansas — Arkansas sued YouTube and parent company
Alphabet on Monday, saying the video-sharing platform is made
deliberately addictive and fueling a mental health crisis among youth in
the state.</p>
<p>Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office filed the lawsuit in state
court, accusing them of violating the state’s deceptive trade practices
and public nuisance laws. The lawsuit claims the site is addictive and
has resulted in the state spending millions on expanded mental health
and other services for young people.</p>
<p>“YouTube amplifies harmful material, doses users with dopamine hits,
and drives youth engagement and advertising revenue,” the lawsuit said.
“As a result, youth mental health problems have advanced in lockstep
with the growth of social media, and in particular, YouTube.”</p>
<p>Alphabet’s Google, which owns the video service and is also named as
a defendant in the case, denied the lawsuit’s claims.</p>
<p>“Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always
been core to our work. In collaboration with youth, mental health and
parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young
people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust
controls,” Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in a statement. “The
allegations in this complaint are simply not true.”</p>
<p>YouTube requires users under 17 to get their parent’s permission
before using the site, while accounts for users younger than 13 must be
linked to a parental account. But it is possible to watch YouTube
without an account, and kids can easily lie about their age.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is the latest in an ongoing push by state and federal
lawmakers to highlight the impact that social media sites have on
younger users. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in June called on
Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their
effects on young people’s lives, like those now mandatory on cigarette
boxes.</p>
<p>Arkansas last year filed similar lawsuits against TikTok and Facebook
parent company Meta, claiming the social media companies were misleading
consumers about the safety of children on their platforms and
protections of users’ private data. Those lawsuits are still pending in
state court.</p>
<p>Arkansas also enacted a law requiring parental consent for minors to
create new social media accounts, though that measure has been blocked
by a federal judge.</p>
<p>Along with TikTok, YouTube is one of the most popular sites for
children and teens. Both sites have been questioned in the past for
hosting, and in some cases promoting, videos that encourage gun
violence, eating disorders and self-harm.</p>
<p>YouTube in June changed its policies about firearm videos,
prohibiting any videos demonstrating how to remove firearm safety
devices. Under the new policies, videos showing homemade guns, automatic
weapons and certain firearm accessories like silencers will be
restricted to users 18 and older.</p>
<p>Arkansas’ lawsuit claims that YouTube’s algorithms steer youth to
harmful adult content, and that it facilitates the spread of child
sexual abuse material.</p>
<p>The lawsuit doesn’t seek specific damages, but asks that YouTube be
ordered to fund prevention, education and treatment for “excessive and
problematic use of social media.”</p>

<h2 id="arch-linux-and-valve-deepen-ties-with-direct-collaboration">Arch
Linux and Valve deepen ties with direct collaboration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>When Valve took its second major crack at making Steam machines
happen, in the form of the Steam Deck, one of the big surprises was the
company’s choice to base the Linux operating system the Steam Deck uses
on Arch Linux, instead of the Debian base it was using before. It seems
this choice is not only benefiting Valve, but also Arch. We are excited
to announce that Arch Linux is entering into a direct collaboration with
Valve. Valve is generously providing backing for two critical projects
that will have a huge impact on our distribution: a build service
infrastructure and a secure signing enclave. By supporting work on a
freelance basis for these topics, Valve enables us to work on them
without being limited solely by the free time of our volunteers. ↫
Levente Polyak This is great news for Arch, but of course, also for
Linux in general. The work distributions do to improve their user
experience tend to be picked up by other distributions, and it’s clear
that Valve’s contributions have been vast. With these collaborations,
Valve is also showing it’s in it for the long term, and not just
interested in taking from the community, but also in giving, which is
good news for the large number of people now using Linux for gaming. The
Arch team highlights that these projects will follow the regular
administrative and decision-making processes within the distribution, so
we’re not looking at parallel efforts forced upon everyone else without
a say.</p>

id="biden-acts-to-keep-asylum-ban-at-us-mexico-border-in-place-longer">Biden
acts to keep asylum ban at US-Mexico border in place longer</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will toughen an asylum ban at
the U.S.-Mexico border to keep it in place for longer, U.S. Department
of Homeland Security officials said Monday, signaling a desire to
further curb illegal crossings. </p>
<p>The change, effective just after midnight, will leave asylum
restrictions in place until arrests of migrants crossing illegally drop
below a daily average of 1,500 over 28 days, lengthened from the current
seven-day period, one of the officials said on a call with
reporters.  </p>
<p>President Joe Biden, a Democrat, issued the asylum ban in June to
drive down record numbers of migrants caught crossing illegally.
Immigration is a top voter issue in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election,
which is pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican Donald
Trump, an immigration hardliner. </p>
<p>Harris backs making the ban even harder to lift, Reuters reported
last week, but the Biden administration did not adopt her proposal. </p>
<p>U.S. border authorities have apprehended roughly 54,000 migrants in
September to date, down steeply from a peak of 250,000 in December, a
DHS official said. </p>
<p>A daily average of 1,500 over 28 days would represent a total of
42,000 migrants in that period. </p>
<p>As part of the changes to the asylum ban, all unaccompanied children
caught crossing illegally will be counted in the tally used to decide
whether the restrictions can be lifted. Previously, only children from
Mexico and Canada were counted. </p>
<p>The stricter approach “ensures that the drop in encounters is a
sustained decrease” and not tied to short-term trends, a DHS official
said, speaking under condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>Immigrant rights groups led by the American Civil Liberties Union
have sued over the asylum ban, arguing that it runs counter to U.S.
asylum law and closely parallels a Trump ban blocked in court.</p>

accused of Trump assassination plot in Florida pleads not guilty</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>west palm beach, florida — Ryan Routh, the 58-year-old man accused of
plotting to kill Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at his
Florida golf course, pleaded not guilty on Monday to several federal
charges.</p>
<p>His lawyer Kristy Militello entered the not guilty plea during a
brief arraignment in a West Palm Beach federal courthouse and requested
a jury trial.</p>
<p>Wearing a beige prison uniform and shackles on his wrists and ankles,
Routh answered “yes, your honor,” when the magistrate judge asked him if
he was aware of the charges against him.</p>
<p>Routh was arrested on September 15 after a Secret Service agent saw
the barrel of a rifle poking out from brush on the perimeter of the West
Palm Beach golf course where Trump was playing a round.</p>
<p>The agent opened fire and Routh, who fled in a vehicle, was arrested
shortly later.</p>
<p>He has been charged with attempted assassination of a major
presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and firearms
offenses.</p>
<p>A federal judge ruled last week that Routh, identified as a Hawaii
resident, should remain in custody.</p>
<p>FBI analysis of Routh’s phone showed he had been in Florida since
August 18, and his devices were located multiple times between that date
and September 15 near Trump’s golf course and his Mar-a-Lago residence,
according to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Before being spotted by the Secret Service agent, Routh spent nearly
12 hours in the vicinity of the Trump International Golf Club, according
to his phone location data.</p>
<p>Court documents said Routh allegedly dropped off a box at an
unidentified person’s home several months before the attempted
assassination containing various letters.</p>
<p>One letter, addressed to “The World,” allegedly said: “This was an
assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I am so sorry I failed
you.”</p>
<p>“I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster,” it
said. “It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000
to whomever can complete the job.”</p>
<p>It was the second assassination attempt on Trump this summer. The
first took place on July 13 at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania,
when a gunman opened fire on the former president, killing one person
and wounding Trump in the ear.</p>
<p>The candidate was otherwise unharmed, and the gunman was killed at
the scene.</p>
<p>The Routh case has been assigned at random to federal District Judge
Aileen Cannon — a Trump appointee who dismissed criminal proceedings
against the former president earlier this year over his retention of
top-secret documents at his private residence.</p>

sends a few thousand more troops to Middle East to boost security</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. is sending an additional “few thousand” troops
to the Middle East to bolster security and to be prepared to defend
Israel if necessary, the Pentagon said Monday.</p>
<p>The increased presence will come from multiple fighter jet squadrons,
Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters.</p>
<p>It follows recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war
in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah.</p>
<p>The additional force includes squadrons of F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16,
A-10 and F-22 fighter jets and the personnel needed to support them. The
jets were supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons already there.
Instead, both the existing and new squadrons will remain in place to
double the airpower on hand.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also announced that he was
temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and

<p>
If Hurricane Helene were the only memorable storm to make landfall in
the U.S. in 2024, this would still be remembered as an historically
tragic season. Since its arrival as a Category 4 hurricane late Thursday
night in Florida’s Big Bend region, Helene has killed more than 100
people and caused more than
<a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/helene-aftermath-nearly-100-dead-historic-flooding-millions-without-power-amid-catastrophic-destruction/1697545" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$160
billion</u></a> across six states. Recovery efforts are expected to last
years, if not decades, in the hardest-hit regions of Western North
Carolina, some 300 miles inland and 2,000 feet above
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hurricane-helene-appalachia-tennessee" target="_self"><u>the
nearest coastline</u></a>. “Helene is going to go down as one of the
most impactful hurricanes in U.S. history,” AccuWeather’s senior
director of forecasting operations, Dan DePodwin, told me when we spoke
on Friday.
</p>
<p>
As of Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center is
<a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gtwo.php?basin=atlc&fdays=5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>tracking
five additional systems</u></a> in the Atlantic basin. Two of those
storms reached named status on Friday — Joyce and Isaac — though their
paths appear to keep them safely in the middle of the Atlantic. A third
storm, Kirk, reached tropical storm strength
<a href="https://www.tcpalm.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2024/09/30/tropical-tracker-national-hurricane-center-kirk-isaac-joyce-12-florida-us-impacts/75443574007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>on
Monday</u></a> and is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane, but
is likewise likely to turn north and stay out at sea.
</p>
<p>
But the two other systems could potentially make U.S. landfall. The
first and most concerning is
<a href="https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2024-09-30-tropical-development-caribbean-gulf-early-october" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
area of low pressure in the Caribbean</u></a> “similar to where Helene
developed,” DePodwin told me. “We’re going to be monitoring that from
the middle to end of [this] week. All options are open with where it
could go — anywhere along the Gulf Coast, from Mexico to Florida.”
</p>
<p>
Directly behind Kirk, in the eastern Tropical Atlantic and out toward
the Cape Verde islands, another tropical depression is likely forming.
“Anytime you get a tropical wave coming off of Africa this time of year,
in late September or early October,” you want to keep an eye on it,
DePodwin went on. Sometimes, depending on the weather patterns, those
storms stay far out at sea, like Joyce or Kirk. “But the next one
probably has a better chance of making it farther west across the
Atlantic” because of the prevailing weather patterns, DePodwin said. “So
we’ll keep an eye on that one” — though forecasters are still days away
from knowing if it could make it as far west as the East Coast.
</p>
<p>
Let this be a lesson in speaking too soon. Although the 2024 hurricane
season went through a long lull at the end of the summer, it’s about to
definitively silence any talk of it being a
“<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4866088-the-2024-hurricane-season-was-expected-to-be-especially-bad-why-is-it-so-quiet/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quiet</u></a>”
year. “We’re predicting at least [five] more named storms to get to that
16 to 20 named storm range that we have for the season,” DePodwin told
me. Many of those would likely come in October, which “can be a pretty
active month,” but due to the
“<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-extremely-active#:~:text=La%20Ni%C3%B1a%20%E2%80%9Ctypically%20increases%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20activity%20through%20decreases%20in%20vertical%20wind%20shear.%E2%80%9D" target="_self"><u>La
Niña pattern</u></a> we’re moving into and the very warm waters of the
[Atlantic] Basin, we think we could get a couple of named storms in
November, which is not always the case.”
</p>
<p>
Finishing the season with 16 to 20 named storms would put 2024 well
above the 1991-2020 average of 14 named storms per year. But as
hurricane forecasters are always
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-season-2024" target="_self"><u>quick
to point out</u></a>, all it takes is <em><em>one</em></em> destructive
storm making landfall for it to be a “bad” hurricane year. In that case,
there’s no debate: 2024 is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/north-carolina-helene-flooding" target="_self"><u><em><em>already</em></em></u></a>
bad. Now we must wait,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/flash-flood-warning-watch" target="_self"><u>prepare</u></a>,
and hope it doesn’t get any worse.

id="californias-new-law-forces-digital-stores-to-admit-youre-just-licensing-content-not-buying-it">California’s
new law forces digital stores to admit you’re just licensing content,
not buying it</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law (AB 2426) to combat
“disappearing” purchases of digital games, movies, music, and ebooks.
The legislation will force digital storefronts to tell customers they’re
just getting a license to use the digital media, rather than suggesting
they actually own it. When the law comes into effect next year, it will
ban digital storefronts from using terms like “buy” or “purchase,”
unless they inform customers that they’re not getting unrestricted
access to whatever they’re buying. Storefronts will have to tell
customers they’re getting a license that can be revoked as well as
provide a list of all the restrictions that come along with it.
Companies that break the rule could be fined for false advertising. ↫
Emma Roth at The Verge A step in the right direction, but a lot more is
definitely needed. This law in particular seems to leave a lot of wiggle
room for companies to keep using the “purchase” term while hiding the
disclosure somewhere in the very, very small fine print. I would much
rather a law like this just straight up ban the use of the term
“purchase” and similar terms when all you’re getting is a license. Why
allow them to keep lying about the nature of the transaction in exchange
for some fine print somewhere? The software industry in particular has
been enjoying a free ride when it comes to consumer protection laws, and
the kind of malpractice, lack of accountability, and laughable quality
control would have any other industry shut down in weeks for severe
negligence. We’re taking baby steps, but it seems we’re finally arriving
at a point where basic consumer protection laws and rights are being
applied to software, too. Several decades too late, but at least it’s
something.</p>

“They say the new thing is hydrogen cars, but they’re having a problem.

<p>
This is, admittedly, a pretty funny bit — even if it’s totally
inaccurate, according to Bill Elrick, the executive director of the
Hydrogen Fuel Cell Partnership, a nonprofit group of auto manufacturers,
energy providers, and government agencies that promote hydrogen vehicles
in California. “I get where it comes from, and it is one of our biggest
challenges in the industry — helping people understand what hydrogen is
without diving into the depths of how a vehicle operates,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
As Elrick pointed out, when most people hear “hydrogen,” they think
either of water (“which is fine”), the Hindenburg disaster (“we don’t do
anything 100 years later the same way that we used to”), or, most
problematically, the hydrogen bomb. “That’s something that is a
completely different chemical reaction and, I think, where some of the
safety scare comes from,” Elrick told me.
</p>
<p>
But hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (or HFCVs) are no more a bomb than
gas-powered vehicles — perhaps <em><em>less</em></em> so, because they
must meet the same rigorous safety codes and standards as any other car
or truck on the road in addition to extra precautions to ensure the fuel
cells won’t be punctured in a bad accident or potentially leak.
</p>
<p>
In a HFCV, hydrogen stored in a high-pressure tank is mixed in a fuel
cell with oxygen from the air to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWOVzSmc72E&t=259s&ab_channel=BeyondFuel" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">induce
a chemical reaction</a> that produces electricity, which powers an
electric motor that drives the car, just as it would in an EV. While
batteries and electricity are familiar concepts, however, and therefore
less scary as automotive power sources, current popular
<a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydrogen/use-of-hydrogen.php#:~:text=electric%20power%20generation.-,Hydrogen%20is%20used%20in%20industrial%20processes,the%20sulfur%20content%20of%20fuels." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>uses
of hydrogen</u></a>, such as refining oil and producing fertilizers, are
not as visible to most people going about their daily lives as, say,
their cell phones.
</p>
<p>
That’s not to say hydrogen is 100% safe. “Anything that moves a vehicle
that weighs two tons or more — if it’s electricity, gasoline, or
hydrogen — clearly has dangers and risks associated with it,” Elrick
said. “If we could power our cars with <em><em>peanut butter</em></em>,
it would have that energy potential.” But car manufacturers (just like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-boat-car-electrocution-water" target="_self"><u>electric
boat manufacturers</u></a>) have considered the possibility of their
vehicles being involved in crashes and designed them accordingly.
</p>
<p>
The Center for Hydrogen Safety maintains a database of hydrogen-related
accidents
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/hydrogen-could-fuel-u-s-energy-transition-but-is-it-safe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
serve as “lessons learned”</u></a> as the technology continues to
develop. Though there are still relatively few HFCVs on the roads, as of
this spring there had been
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a41103863/hydrogen-cars-fcev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>no
recorded automotive fatalities</u></a> credited
<em><em>specifically</em></em> to hydrogen fuel cells. (In other words,
no one has ended up “about seven blocks away” dead from an explosion.)
One researcher
<a href="https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/npre470/sp2019/web/readings/Hydrogen%20safety%20issues.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>even
found</u></a> that “in a collision in open spaces,” an HFCV should
actually have “less potential hazard” than a gas car due to the
extensive precautions taken when building their tanks (“their hardware
would likely survive even if the rest of the car were destroyed in a
crash,”
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a41103863/hydrogen-cars-fcev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>per
</u><u><em><em>Car and Driver</em></em></u></a>).
</p>
<p>
But Trump’s HFCV-phobia probably isn’t the biggest takeaway here. Some
sectors of the hydrogen industry are potentially on the chopping block
if Trump returns to the White House — since, as my colleague
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/trump-tech-vc" target="_blank">Katie
Brigham writes</a>, “green hydrogen made from renewable-powered
electrolyzers is expensive and the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>proposed

generous tax credit [would likely be]
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>goners</u></a>”
under a Republican administration. Trump’s suspicion of new uses for
hydrogen certainly doesn’t bode well.
</p>
<p>
As for any lingering fears about exploding hydrogen cars that Trump
might have planted — hey, at least it’d be a quicker end than
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/electric-boat-car-electrocution-water" target="_self"><u>death-by-shark</u></a>.

</p>
<p>
The plant was shuttered in 2022, and since 2023, state and federal
officials have been working to reopen the plant — as have the plant’s
owner, Holtec, and Wolverine Power, a power company that purchases power
on behalf of its member utilities. Those efforts received a boost Monday
morning with the closing of a $1.52 billion loan guarantee from the
Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office, announced provisionally in
March, and more than $1.3 billion in funds from the Department of
Agriculture, split up between Wolverine Power and Hoosier Energy, a
cooperative serving rural utilities in Indiana and Illinois. The USDA
funds will defray a quarter of the cost of the power purchase agreement
between the cooperatives and Palisades, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture
Xochitl Torres Small told reporters.
</p>
<p>
The restarted plant would have some 800 megawatts of capacity, and the
project will employ some 600 people, said Deputy Secretary of Energy
Dave Turk on a call with reporters. The plant could be up and running in
“a couple of years,” an administration official said. “The funds from
this closed loan from the DOE announced today will be utilized in the
necessary inspections, testing, restoration, rebuilding, and replacement
of existing equipment,” the official said. Holtec is currently working
with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on reauthorizing its license to
operate the plant.

Katie Brigham reported</a>. The federal agency and its official
nonprofit partner, the National Forest Foundation, have partnered with
the San Francisco-based company on a pilot program to turn leftover
trees and other debris from forest-thinning operations into bio-oil, a
liquid made from organic matter, to be injected underground. The project
is a part of a larger Cal Fire grant, to implement forest health
measures as well as seek out innovative biomass utilization solutions.
If the pilot scales up, Charm can generate carbon removal credits by
permanently locking away the CO2 from biomass, while the Forest Service
will finally find a use for the piles of leftover trees that are too
small for the sawmill’s taste. The pilot is taking place in Inyo
National Forest in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, and comprises 538 acres of
forest. Charm is processing just 60 tons of biomass over six weeks of
operation in Inyo. The pilot is already more than halfway over.

<h2 id="at-100-former-president-jimmy-carters-legacy-reevaluated">At
100, former President Jimmy Carter’s legacy reevaluated</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia — When he returned to Plains, Georgia, in 1981,
President Jimmy Carter was defeated — rejected by voters in a landslide
election to Republican Ronald Reagan. The pouring rain at Carter’s
welcome home reception reflected his gloomy mood and that of the
country.</p>
<p>“In office, he was a political failure. He lost overwhelming[ly] to
Ronald Reagan. But he was a substantive and visionary success,” said
author and historian Jonathan Alter, who recognizes what many know
Carter for today — humanitarian work with his Carter Center, “waging
peace, fighting disease and building hope” around the world that led to
Jimmy Carter receiving the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>“He’s done terrific work supervising elections in more than 100
countries. But former presidents don’t have as much power as presidents,
not nearly as much, and the list of his accomplishments as president
that were ignored, minimized or forgotten entirely was very long,” said
Alter.</p>
<p>The Iran hostage crisis, rising inflation and oil embargoes of the
1970s doomed Carter’s White House tenure, casting a long shadow over his
legacy. However, the onetime peanut farmer, Georgia governor, president
and Nobel Peace Prize laureate’s 100th birthday milestone comes as
authors and historians reevaluate his failures and accomplishments as a
one-term U.S. president.</p>
<p>Alter’s biography, His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, A Life, is among
several that conclude his four years in the White House were anything
but a failure.</p>
<p>“Not just famously [the] Camp David accords and opening relations
with China,” Alter told VOA in an interview in August at the Democratic
National Convention in Chicago, “but a long string of legislative
accomplishments on the environment and many other issues that actually
exceed the legislative accomplishments of both Barack Obama and Bill
Clinton.”</p>
<p>Carter signed the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation
Act protecting more than 100 million acres — including land, national
parks, refuges, monuments, forests and conservation areas — which Alter
says is now considered one of the most important pieces of environmental
legislation ever passed.</p>
<p>“The story I tell in my book is a surprising one,” said Alter. “It’s
of somebody who worked hard in ways that actually bore fruit.”</p>
<p>“I think we’ll remember President Carter as a president who served in
very enormously difficult times who had to deal with circumstances that
were far beyond his control,” said Joseph Crespino, Emory University’s
first Jimmy Carter Professor of History.” Carter routinely visited with
Crespino and his students in Atlanta to discuss the good and bad
decisions he made while president.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Putting human rights front and center in American foreign policy —
no president had done that in the way that Jimmy Carter had,” Crespino
told VOA during a recent interview at his office on campus at Emory
University. “It was important in shifting the balance of power in the
Cold War, but it was also an important moment in the aftermath of the
Vietnam War to reassert once again America’s moral responsibilities in
the world.”</p>
<p>Crespino says some of Carter’s overlooked domestic accomplishments
include reorganizing the federal government and deregulation of the
airline, trucking and beer industries.</p>
<p>“We oftentimes associate a kind of freeing up of the free enterprise
economy with the conservative turn that came in with Ronald Reagan, when
in fact Jimmy Carter before Reagan was already doing a lot of
deregulatory work in his presidency in recognizing the kind of limits of
government oversight of these private industries.”</p>
<p>Members of Carter’s Cabinet, including former United Nations
Ambassador Andrew Young, are grateful his long life has allowed him to
witness the longer lens of history reflect more positively on his
legacy.</p>
<p>“There’s no place in the world I know where people don’t have some
good things to say about him,” Young told VOA as he spoke with reporters
September 17 at Carter’s 100th birthday concert at the Fox theater in
Atlanta. “Whether he succeeded or not … he gave it as good a try and
came as far as the world would let him go.”</p>
<p>A world that continues to benefit from the Carter Center’s work,
including fighting diseases including Guinea worm, which is down to a
few cases in Africa and could become only the second disease ever
eradicated.</p>

id="former-president-jimmy-carter-reaches-historic-100th-birthday">Former
President Jimmy Carter Reaches Historic 100th Birthday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Atlanta, Georgia — In a celebration fit for a centenarian, the
historic Fox theater in Atlanta recently hosted dozens of musical acts
and thousands of guests for a concert celebrating the 100th birthday of
Georgia’s one-time governor, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>“It’s a way to be together and I think that’s who he is
fundamentally,” said Jason Carter, who said he believes the concert,
featuring some performers that also campaigned for his grandfather in
the 1970s, is a unifying – and bipartisan – way to celebrate what one
documentary film director calls the “Rock ’n Roll President.”</p>
<p>“It’s one of those fundamental human connections that brings people
together across geographies, across culture, across any sort of racial
dividing lines,” Jason Carter told VOA during a press event ahead of the
performances. “You’ll have both Democrats and Republicans here
tonight.”</p>
<p>Despite the many speakers, actors, musicians and former presidents
who sent video tributes, the one person noticeably absent from the
celebration was Jimmy Carter himself. He remains in hospice care at his
home 240 kilometers south of Atlanta.</p>
<p>“It’s a 600-person village in the middle of nowhere, and all of his
other work at the end of the road in Africa, Mali, South Sudan, has been
in those same kinds of 600-person villages,” Jason Carter said.</p>
<p>“He feels a kinship there and he feels a connection and the way that
he marks this moment is by being at home.”</p>
<p>Jason Carter said his grandfather will watch the concert broadcast on
Georgia Public Television, as he celebrates his historic milestone
birthday in Plains, Georgia, not far from where his story began, at the
Wise Sanitarium, where on October 1, 1924, Lillian Carter, then a nurse
at the facility, gave birth to the first U.S. president to have been
born in a hospital. The facility is now called the Lillian G. Carter
Nursing Center.</p>
<p>“But the only reason he was born in a hospital was because his mother
was working that day,” Jill Stuckey, a Carter family friend, told
VOA.</p>
<p>Stuckey serves as superintendent of the Jimmy Carter National
Historic Site in Plains which includes Carter’s preserved Depression-era
boyhood farm, the old Plains High School where Carter studied and the
railroad depot Carter converted into his campaign headquarters in his
successful 1976 White House bid.</p>
<p>“After the hospice announcement nearly a year ago, I didn’t think
we’d be at this point,” Stuckey said during an interview with VOA,
standing next to a replica of the famous Resolute Desk from the White
House Oval Office, now a big draw for tourists who visit Plains High
School.</p>
<p>Stuckey said Plains celebrates its famous neighbor every day, but
this historic birthday is marked by serving others.</p>
<p>“We’re naturalizing 100 new citizens in his honor. Thanks to the
secretary of the Navy, we’re having four F-18 jets flyover.”</p>
<p>She said another, smaller birthday concert in the Plains High School
auditorium is also meant to help the community celebrate the man who
rose from being a local peanut farmer to president of the United
States.</p>
<p>“He definitely deserves a lot of fanfare, because he’s definitely the
greatest person I’ve ever met in my life,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Carter’s milestone is a bittersweet occasion in Plains, though, it’s
the first Carter has spent since his wife, Rosalynn, died last
November.</p>
<p>“Seventy-seven-and-a-half years of marriage, to be without your
partner, your soul mate you know it’s very, very tough times,” said
Stuckey, “It’s tough times on him, but on all of us that knew her, that
loved her, the family members.”</p>
<p>Carter’s birthday celebration, which began at the Fox theater in
September and ends in Plains October 1, brought his large extended
family together, including his great-grandson, Charlie Carter, who
hinted it may not be the last time such a gathering occurs.</p>
<p>“No… maybe his 101th?”</p>
<p>Jimmy Carter also holds the record for the longest post-presidential
career. After departing the White House in 1981, he and Rosalynn founded
the Atlanta-based global nonprofit Carter Center, which fights neglected
tropical diseases, promotes peaceful conflict resolution, and monitors
elections around the world, causes which led to Carter winning the 2002
Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

Is Working With the U.S. Forest Service on a Carbon Removal Pilot</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Deep in Inyo National Forest in the Eastern Sierra Nevada are a couple
of bright white domed tents protecting an assemblage of technical
equipment and machinery that, admittedly, looks a bit out of place
amidst the natural splendor. Surrounding shipping containers boast a
large “Charm Industrial” logo, an indication that, yes, the U.S. Forest
Service is now working with the well-funded carbon removal startup in a
two-for-one endeavor to reduce wildfire risk and permanently remove
carbon from the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
The federal agency and its official nonprofit partner, the National
Forest Foundation, have partnered with San Francisco-based Charm on a
pilot program to turn leftover trees and other debris from
forest-thinning operations into bio-oil, a liquid made from organic
matter, to be injected underground. The project is a part of a larger
<a href="https://www.grants.ca.gov/grants/cal-fire-forest-health-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cal
Fire grant</u></a>, to implement forest health measures as well as seek
out innovative biomass utilization solutions. If the pilot scales up,
Charm can generate carbon removal credits by permanently locking away
the CO2 from biomass, while the Forest Service will finally find a use
for the piles of leftover trees that are too small for the sawmill’s
taste.
</p>
<p>
“It’s actually pretty shocking how big the backlog of wildfire fuel
reduction projects is in the United States,” Peter Reinhardt, co-founder
and CEO at Charm, told me. “The pattern of putting out fires as much as
possible, as quickly as possible, has created just an enormous amount of
fuel in our forests that has to be treated one way or another.”
Controlled burns and forest thinning are the primary ways of dealing
with this fuel buildup, but as Reinhardt explained to me, California has
few pellet mills, and thus few offtakers for leftover wood. What’s left
often ends up being burned in a big pile.
</p>
<p>
That’s common at Inyo, which is considered a “biomass utilization
desert,” according to Katlyn Lonergan, a program coordinator with the
National Forest Foundation. NFF is paying Charm a nominal fee to take
the waste biomass off their hands, though not nearly enough to
constitute a primary source of revenue for the company.
</p>
<p>
At this point, funding isn’t a problem at Charm. Last year, the company
announced a
<a href="https://charmindustrial.com/blog/accelerating-carbon-removal-with-our-100m-series-b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$100
million Series B</u></a> round and received a
<a href="https://frontierclimate.com/writing/first-offtake" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$53
million commitment from Frontier</u></a>, the Big Tech-led carbon
removal initiative, to permanently remove 112,000 tons of CO2 between
2024 and 2030, the coalition’s first offtake agreement. At the time,
Charm had delivered over 6,000 tons of removal, “more than any other
permanent CDR supplier to date,”
<a href="https://frontierclimate.com/portfolio/charm-industrial#:~:text=Charm%20has%20an%20impressive%20track%20record%20of%20execution.%20In%20just%20three%20years%20Charm%20progressed%20from%20a%20concept%20to%20being%20a%20leader%20in%20the%20space%E2%80%94delivering%20%3E6%2C000%20tons%20of%20removal%2C%20more%20than%20any%20other%20permanent%20CDR%20supplier%20to%20date." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
group wrote</u></a>. Since then, the company has received
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/doe-purchase-prize-carbon-removal" target="_self"><u>an
additional $50,000</u></a> from the Department of Energy and is
currently in the running for a DOE carbon removal purchase prize of up
to $3 million.
</p>
<p>
Charm’s process begins with woody biomass and an industrial chipper,
after which the biomass is screened and dried. The chips are then
rapidly heated in a low oxygen environment, a process called fast
pyrolysis, which vaporizes the cellulose in the biomass. The remaining
plant matter is then condensed into a liquid and injected thousands of
feet underground.
</p>
<p>
Until now, the company has gotten
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/05/26/1052671/charm-industrials-carbon-removal-corn/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more</u></a>
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/carbon-capture/inside-charm-industrials-multimillion-dollar-bid-to-remove-co2-with-plants" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attention</u></a>
for its efforts to use
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carbon-removal-startup-charm-industrial-53-million-frontier-2023-5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agricultural
biomass</u></a> like corn stalks. But Reinhardt told me that lately,
100% of the company’s feedstock comes from “fuel load reduction
projects,” — unhealthy trees that have been cut down — though in the
future, it plans to source from both agricultural and forest waste. The
change in feedstock prioritization, Reinhardt said, is due to wildfires
becoming “a more and more urgent issue,” plus the advantages that come
from working with denser materials. “Almost all the cost of biomass is
in the logistics, and the cost of logistics is driven by density,” he
said. Transporting puffy bales of corn stalks, leaves, and husks to
Charm’s pyrolyzer is just not as energy efficient as trucking a log.
</p>
<p>
And because there are <em><em>already</em></em> plenty of piles of logs
and residue sitting around in forests like Inyo, if Charm can bring its
pyrolizers directly <em><em>to</em></em> the forest, it can increase
efficiency still further. Bringing Charm’s operations onsite could
eventually help the Forest Service save money, too. “The Eastern Sierra,
it’s pretty isolated for this industry,” Lonergan told me. “And so we
are actually hauling that [biomass] to Carson City, which is three and a
half hours away.”
</p>
<p>
Fixing the agency’s transportation woes is a ways away though — Charm is
starting small, processing just 60 tons of biomass over six weeks of
operation in Inyo. The pilot is already more than halfway over.
</p>
<p>
Charm won’t be claiming carbon removal credits for this project, as
Reinhardt told me it’s more a “demonstration of the production” to make
sure the logistics work out. Scaling up will mean deploying larger
pyrolyzers that can process significantly more biomass. “Our next
iteration of pyrolyzers will be probably 10x the throughput,” Reinhardt
told me. “So instead of 1 or one-and-a-half tons a day, about 10 to 15
tons a day.” Those numbers start to sound pretty darn small, though,
when you consider the amount of forestry biomass and agricultural
residue generated per year, which Reinhardt said is around 50 million
tons and 300 million tons, respectively.
</p>
<p>
And while this particular project comprises 538 acres of forest,
California alone has set a goal of thinning 1 million acres per year to
reduce wildfire risk. Basically, Charm’s not going to run out of
feedstock anytime soon, and the Forest Service isn’t going to find a
quick fix for its piles and piles of unwanted wood. “I don’t envision it
being the one solution that fits all,” Lonergan said of Charm’s
technology. But, she told me, “it can absolutely contribute to these
biomass materials that we don’t have an answer for yet.”

<h2 id="cosmic-alpha-2-released">COSMIC alpha 2 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: OS News</p>
<p>System76, the premiere Linux computer manufacturer and creator of the
COSMIC desktop environment, has updated COSMIC’s Alpha release to Alpha
2. The latest release includes more Settings pages, the bulk of
functionality for COSMIC Files, highly requested window management
features, and considerable infrastructure work for screen reader
support, as well as some notable bug fixes. ↫ system76’s blog The pace
of development for COSMIC remains solid, even after the first alpha
release. This second alpha keeps adding a lot of things considered basic
for any desktop environment, such as settings panels for power and
battery, sounds, displays, and many more. It also brings window
management support for focus follows cursor and cursor follows focus,
which will surely please the very specific, small slice of people who
swear by those. Also, you can now disable the super key. A major new
feature that I’m personally very happy about is the “adjust density”
feature. COSMIC will allow you to adjust the spacing between the various
user interface elements so you can choose to squeeze more information on
your screen, which is one of the major complaints I have about modern UI
design in macOS, Windows, and GNOME. Being able to adjust this to your
liking is incredibly welcome, especially combined with COSMIC’s ability
to change from ’rounded’ UI elements to ‘square’ UI elements. The file
manager has also been vastly, vastly improved, tons of bugs were fixed,
and much, much more. It seems COSMIC is on the right path, and I can’t
wait to try out the first final result once it lands.</p>

<h2 id="gsoc-2024-abi-lowering-in-clangir">GSoC 2024: ABI Lowering in
ClangIR</h2>
<p>date: 2024-09-30, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
ClangIR is an ongoing effort to build a high-level intermediate
representation(IR) for C/C++ within the LLVM ecosystem. Its key
advantage lies in its abilityto retain more source code information.
While ClangIR is making progress, itstill lacks certain features,
notably ABI handling. Currently, ClangIR lowersmost functions without
accounting for ABI-specific calling convention details.
</p>
<h2 id="goals">
Goals
</h2>
<p>
The “Build &amp; Run SingleSource Benchmarks with ClangIR - Part 2”
Google Summer ofCode 2024 builds on my contributions from GSoC 2023 by
addressing one of themain issues I encountered: target-specific
lowering. It focuses on extendingClangIR’s code generation capabilities,
particularly in ABI-lowering for X86-64.Several tests rely on operations
and types (e.g., <code>va_arg</code> calls and complexdata types) that
require target-specific information to compile correctly.
</p>
<p>
The concrete steps to achieve this were:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Implement foundational infrastructure</strong> that can scale to
multiplearchitectures while adhering to ClangIR design principles such
as CodeGenparity, feature guarding, and AST backreferences.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Handle basic calling convention scenarios</strong> as a proof of
concept tovalidate the foundational infrastructure.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Add lowering for a second architecture</strong> to further
validate theinfrastructure’s extensibility to multiple architectures.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Unify target-specific ClangIR lowering into the
library</strong>, as there are afew isolated methods handling
target-specific code lowering like<code>cir.va_arg</code>.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Integrate calling convention lowering into the main
pipeline</strong> to ensurefuture contributions and continued
development of this infrastructure.
</li>
</ol>

</p>
<h3 id="target-lowering-library">
Target Lowering Library
</h3>
<p>
The most significant contribution of this project was the development of
amodular
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/643"><code>TargetLowering</code>
library</a>.This ensures that target-specific MLIR lowering passes can
leverage this sharedlibrary for lowering logic. The library also follows
ClangIR’s feature guardingprinciples, ensuring that any contributor can
refer to the original CodeGen forcontributions, and any unimplemented
feature is asserted at specific codepoints, making it easy to track
missing functionality.
</p>
<h3 id="calling-convention-lowering-pass">
Calling Convention Lowering Pass
</h3>
<p>
As a proof of concept, the initial development of the
<code>TargetLowering</code> libraryfocused on implementing a
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/642">calling convention
loweringpass</a> that targets multiplearchitectures. Currently, ClangIR
ignores the target ABI during CodeGen toretain high-level information.
For example, structs are not unraveled to improveargument-passing
efficiency. ABI-specific LLVM attributes are also ignored. Thispass
addresses these issues by properly tagging LLVM attributes and
rewritingfunction definitions and calls to handle unraveled structs.
This was implementedfor both X86-64 and
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/clangir/pull/679">AArch64</a>,demonstrating
the library’s multi-architecture support.
</p>
<h2 id="shortcomings">
Shortcomings
</h2>
<h3 id="target-specific-lowering-unification">
Target-Specific Lowering Unification
</h3>
<p>
While some target-specific lowering code was moved into the library, it
wascopied and pasted rather than properly integrated. This is not ideal
forleveraging the library’s multi-architecture features.
</p>
<h3 id="inclusion-in-the-main-pipeline">
Inclusion in the Main Pipeline
</h3>
<p>
This is still a work in progress, as the library is not yet mature
enough tohandle most pre-existing ClangIR tests. There are also feature
guards withunreachable statements for many unimplemented features.
</p>
<h2 id="future-work">
Future Work
</h2>
<p>
Now that there is a base infrastructure for handling target-agnostic
totarget-specific CIR code, there is a large amount of future work to be
done,including:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Improving DataLayout-related queries using MLIR’s built-in tools.
</li>
<li>
Implementing calling convention lowering for additional types, such
aspointers.
</li>
<li>
Extending the TargetLowering library to support more architectures.
</li>
<li>
Unifying remaining target-specific lowering code from other parts of
ClangIR.
</li>
</ul>
