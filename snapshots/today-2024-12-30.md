## Another AI cautionary tale

In one of my YouTube videos, I talk about how I&#8217;ve wired up my solar/battery system to ensure the energy in my home battery isn&#8217;t ever used to charge my car (which has a much bigger battery, so doing this doesn&#8217;t normally make sense), while still allowing the car to be charged using any excess <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2024/12/30/12327/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## Quoting John Gruber

date: 2024-12-30, updated: 2024-12-30, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<blockquote cite="https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/openai_unimaginable"><p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/26/zuck-open-source-ai">There is no technical moat</a> in this field, and so OpenAI is the epicenter of an investment bubble.</p>
<p>Thus, effectively, OpenAI is to this decade’s generative-AI revolution what Netscape was to the 1990s’ internet revolution. The revolution is real, but it’s ultimately going to be a commodity technology layer, not the foundation of a defensible proprietary moat. In 1995 investors mistakenly thought investing in Netscape was a good way to bet on the future of the open internet and the World Wide Web in particular. Investing in OpenAI today is a bit like that — generative AI technology has a bright future and is transforming the world, but it’s wishful thinking that the breakthrough client implementation is going to form the basis of a lasting industry titan.</p></blockquote>

## Public Domain Day—A Diversion to Sound Recordings

Happy Public Domain Day!&#160; Every January 1st the United States adds a new crop of works to its public domain. Though the term of copyright is very long, the Constitution provides that it must—eventually—end. This transition is arguably the most important moment in the life of a creative work, excepting only its initial creation. The [&#8230;]

## How we think about Threads’ iOS performance

date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2024/12/18/ios/how-we-think-about-threads-ios-performance/">How we think about Threads’ iOS performance</a></strong></p>
This article by Dave LaMacchia and Jason Patterson provides an incredibly deep insight into what effective performance engineering looks like for an app with 100s of millions of users.</p>
<p>I always like hearing about custom performance metrics with their own acronyms. Here we are introduced to <strong>%FIRE</strong> - the portion of people who experience a <em>frustrating image-render experience</em> (based on how long an image takes to load after the user scrolls it into the viewport), <strong>TTNC</strong> (<em>time-to-network content</em>) measuring time from app launch to fresh content visible in the feed and <strong>cPSR</strong> (<em>creation-publish success rate</em>) for how often a user manages to post content that they started to create.</p>
<p>This article introduced me to the concept of a <strong>boundary test</strong>, described like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A boundary test is one where we measure extreme ends of a boundary to learn what the effect is. In our case, we introduced a slight bit of latency when a small percentage of our users would navigate to a user profile, to the conversion view for a post, or to their activity feed. </p>
<p>This latency would allow us to extrapolate what the effect would be if we similarly <em>improved</em> how we delivered content to those views.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>We learned that iOS users don’t tolerate a lot of latency. The more we added, the less often they would launch the app and the less time they would stay in it. With the smallest latency injection, the impact was small or negligible for some views, but the largest injections had negative effects across the board. People would read fewer posts, post less often themselves, and in general interact less with the app. Remember, we weren’t injecting latency into the core feed, either; just into the profile, permalink, and activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's a whole lot more in there, including details of their custom internal performance logger (SLATE, the “Systemic LATEncy” logger) and several case studies of surprising performance improvements made with the assistance of their metrics and tools, plus some closing notes on how Swift concurrency is being adopted throughout Meta.

## Asus ROG NUC 15 (2025) with Intel Arrow Lake and NVIDIA RTX 50 graphics leaks ahead of CES

## Google search hallucinates Encanto 2

date: 2024-12-29, updated: 2024-12-29, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3leezrzlvrk2m">Google search hallucinates Encanto 2</a></strong></p>
Jason Schreier on Bluesky:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was excited to tell my kids that there's a sequel to Encanto, only to scroll down and learn that Google's AI just completely made this up</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just replicated the same result by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=encanto+2&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari">searching Google for encanto 2</a>. Here's what the "AI overview" at the top of the page looked like:</p>
<p><img alt="Search Labs | Al Overview. Encanto 2: A New Generation is an animated musical fantasy comedy film that is scheduled for release in the United States on August 25, 2024. lt is the sequel to the 2021 Disney film Encanto. Here are some details about the film: Plot: The film takes place years after the original and centers on a new generation of the Madrigal family, led by an older Mirabel and her grandson, José. Directors: Byron Howard and Jared Bush are directing the film. Show more..." src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/encanto-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>Only when I clicked the "Show more" link did it become clear what had happened:</p>
<p><img alt="Writers: Jared Bush and Charise Castro Smith are writing the film. Music: Lin-Manuel Miranda will write original songs for the film, as he did for the
original. Some say that a sequel to Encanto is logical because of the film's huge  investment in the franchise. Jared Bush, who co-directed the original Encanto, has hinted that a sequel may be in the works. He said, &quot;I would love to spend more time in the Madrigal House and return to Encanto.” Generative Al is experimental" src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/encanto-2-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>The link in that first snippet was to the <a href="https://ideas.fandom.com/wiki/Encanto_2:_A_New_Generation">Encanto 2: A New Generation</a> page on <a href="https://ideas.fandom.com/">Idea Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a fanon wiki, and just like fan-fiction wikis, this one has a variety of fan created ideas on here! These include potential sequels and new series that have yet to exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other cited links included <a href="https://screenrant.com/encanto-movie-live-action-images-mirabel-madrigal-family/">this article about Instagram fan art</a> and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/news/encantos-sequel-chances-addressed-by-disney-director/ar-AA1u7ZJB">Encanto's Sequel Chances Addressed by Disney Director</a>, a very thin article built around a short quote from Encanto's director at D23 Brazil.</p>
<p>And that August 2024 release date (which the AI summary weirdly lists as "scheduled for release" despite that date being five months in the past)? It's from the Idea Wiki imaginary info box for the film.</p>
<p>This is a particularly clear example of how badly wrong AI summarization can go. LLMs are gullible: they believe what you tell them, and the web is full of misleading information - some of which is completely innocent.</p>
<p id="hallucination"><strong>Update</strong>: I've had some pushback over my use of the term "hallucination" here, on the basis that the LLM itself is doing what it's meant to: summarizing the RAG content that has been provided to it by the host system.</p>

<p>That's fair: this is not a classic LLM hallucination, where the LLM produces incorrect data purely from knowledge partially encoded in its weights.</p>
<p>I classify this as a bug in Google's larger LLM-powered AI overview system. That system should be able to take the existence of invalid data sources into account - given how common searches for non-existent movie sequels (or TV seasons) are, I would hope that AI overviews could classify such searches and take extra steps to avoid serving misleading answers.</p>
<p>So think this is a "hallucination" bug in the AI overview system itself: it's making statements about the world that are not true.
