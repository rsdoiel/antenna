## Your Low Code Solution Needs an Escape Hatch

date: 2024-05-03, updated: 2024-05-03, from: Deno blog

A low-code solution is a simple way to offer some flexibility for your users. However, to accommodate further customization (especially for enterprise users), you should have an “escape hatch” — simple, code-level customization. Here are three product scenarios and where an escape hatch makes most sense.

<p>The bond market is surging after news that 175,000 people were in payrolls in April versus March. That&#8217;s less than expected and 44% lower than a month earlier. And it&#8217;s the sort of result that those anxious about elevated interest rates want to see. We&#8217;ll discuss.

## US employers add 175,000 jobs in April

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The nation’s employers pulled back on their hiring in April but still added a decent 175,000 jobs in a sign that persistently high interest rates may be starting to slow the robust U.S. job market. 


Friday’s government report showed that last month’s hiring gain was down sharply from the blockbuster increase of 315,000 in March. And it was well below the 233,000 gain that economists had predicted for April. 


Yet the moderation in the pace of hiring, along with a slowdown last month in wage growth, will likely be welcomed by the Federal Reserve, which has kept interest rates at a two-decade high to fight persistently elevated inflation. Hourly wages rose a less-than-expected 0.2% from March and 3.9% from a year earlier, the smallest annual gain since June 2021. 


The Fed has been delaying any consideration of interest rate cuts until it gains more confidence that inflation is steadily slowing toward its target. Fed rate cuts would, over time, reduce the cost of mortgages, auto loans and other consumer and business borrowing. 


Stock futures jumped Friday after the jobs report was released on hopes that rate cuts might now be more likely sometime in the coming months. 


Even with the April hiring slowdown, last month’s job growth amounted to a solid increase, although it was the lowest monthly job growth since October. With the nation’s households continuing their steady spending, many employers have had to keep hiring to meet their customer demand. 


The unemployment rate ticked up 3.9% — the 27th straight month in which it has remained below 4%, the longest such streak since the 1960s. 


Last month's hiring was led by health care companies, which added 56,000 jobs. Warehouse and transportation companies added 22,000 and retailers 20,000. 


The state of the economy is weighing on voters’ minds as the November presidential campaign intensifies. Despite the strength of the job market, Americans remain generally exasperated by high prices, and many of them assign blame to President Joe Biden. 


America’s job market has repeatedly proved more robust than almost anyone had predicted. When the Fed began aggressively raising rates two years ago to fight a punishing inflation surge, most economists expected the resulting jump in borrowing costs to cause a recession and drive unemployment to painfully high levels. 


The Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times from March 2022 to July 2023, taking it to the highest level since 2001. Inflation did steadily cool as it was supposed to — from a year-over-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 3.5% in March. 


Yet the resilient strength of the job market and the overall economy, fueled by steady consumer spending, has kept inflation persistently above the Fed’s 2% target. 


The job market has been showing other signs of eventually slowing. This week, for example, the government reported that job openings fell in March to 8.5 million, the fewest in more than three years. Still, that is nevertheless a large number of vacancies: Before 2021, monthly job openings had never topped 8 million, a threshold they have now exceeded every month since March 2021. 


On a month-over-month basis, consumer inflation hasn’t declined since October. The 3.5% year-over-year inflation rate for March was still running well above the Fed’s 2% target.

## Trump's possible return reignites South Korea nuclear debate

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

Seoul, South Korea — South Korean calls to acquire nuclear weapons, which were subdued for the past year following steps to strengthen the U.S.-South Korea alliance, are once again bubbling to the surface ahead of the possible return of former U.S. President Donald Trump.


Trump, who appears locked in a tight race with President Joe Biden as November’s election approaches, sparked concern this week after making comments that many Korean media interpreted as a threat to pull U.S. troops from South Korea.


In an interview with Time magazine, Trump lamented that U.S. troops are “in a precarious position” — a reference to nuclear-armed North Korea — and said Seoul should pay much more for U.S. protection.


“Why would we defend somebody … and we’re talking about a very wealthy country,” asked Trump, who elsewhere in the interview said U.S. troops were “in a lot of places they shouldn’t be.”


Those kinds of statements are not new. Trump has long questioned the value and necessity of the U.S. military presence in South Korea.


Trump’s supporters say the comments are simply a negotiating tactic meant to persuade South Korea to pay more for the cost of hosting approximately 28,500 U.S. troops. Trump, they insist, does not intend to abandon Seoul.




South Koreans appear less certain about Trump, who once said he “could go either way” on the idea of U.S. troops staying in South Korea.


Many are also concerned Trump could pursue a deal with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that would effectively recognize the North as a nuclear weapons state.


“We can’t allow this. We must have our own nuclear arsenal, in a limited sense,” Yoon Sang-hyun, a five-term conservative lawmaker, said in a Facebook post this week.


Conservative South Korean newspapers have also begun publishing articles reassessing the idea of nuclear arms — an idea once considered unthinkable.


"The level of concern is really high,” said a researcher at a government-linked think tank in Seoul, who supports South Korea considering nuclear weapons in certain Trump-related scenarios.


“Almost every research institution has a project on preparations for the Trump administration,” said the researcher, who noted growing support among colleagues for acquiring a nuclear deterrent.


Many, including the Seoul-based academic, are hesitant to publicly disclose their openness to attaining nuclear capabilities, seeing little incentive to make statements that would risk antagonizing the current or potential leaders of a country that South Korea has relied on for protection for over 70 years.


Public support


If South Korea ever pursues a nuclear arsenal, the decision will come with massive economic, reputational and regional security risks.


Not only could the move upend South Korea’s alliance with the United States, but it could also prompt others in the region to pursue similar weapons, invite international economic sanctions, and would almost certainly elicit a fierce reaction from China, according to analysts.


Despite such barriers, opinion polls consistently indicate between 60% to 70% of South Koreans support their country developing nuclear weapons.


Even many national security experts, who are presumably more aware of the consequences, back such a move.


According to a poll released this week by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, 34% of South Korean elite support acquiring nuclear weapons. That support likely would increase significantly if Trump wins in November, the poll found.


Kim Gunn, who will soon begin a term in South Korea’s National Assembly after recently stepping down as the country’s top nuclear envoy, said he can “fully understand” the sentiment of wanting a nuclear deterrent, considering North Korea’s development of tactical nuclear weapons.


But Kim does not advocate for acquiring nuclear weapons. Instead, he says, it is vital that the South Korean public be assured that the U.S.-South Korean alliance is “well-prepared” to cope with any eventuality.


Last January, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol made global headlines when he suggested South Korea could easily develop its own nuclear arms if the security situation with North Korea worsens.


At the time, South Korea was seeing an unprecedented wave of mostly conservative academics, ex-officials and other commentators calling for nuclear weapons.


Reassurances


Those calls subsided after Yoon and Biden agreed in April 2023 to strengthen the U.S. defense commitment to South Korea in a document known as the Washington Declaration.


In the statement, the United States vowed to deploy more “strategic assets,” such as nuclear-capable submarines, long-range bombers and aircraft carriers, to South Korea. In return, South Korea reaffirmed it would not pursue nuclear weapons.




“The problem is if Trump comes back to the White House, he will probably undermine the very basic pillars of extended deterrence — that is, the deployment of strategic assets and joint military exercises,” said Park Won-gon, a professor at Seoul’s Ewha University.


As president, Trump often slammed what he said were provocative and expensive military exercises with South Korea. During his first summit with Kim in June 2018, Trump unilaterally suspended what he referred to as “war games” with South Korea, stunning some observers in Seoul.


Blunt talk


There is also growing concern about recent comments by former Trump officials, who have hinted at major changes to Washington's South Korea policy, Park said.


Most recently, former senior Pentagon advisor Elbridge Colby told VOA’s Korean Service last month that South Korea’s nuclear armament should no longer be seen as off-limits.


“Nuclear proliferation, even to our allies, is a bad thing. But we live in a world of hard choices, so I think everything needs to be on the table,” said Colby, who is viewed as a leading candidate for a top national security position in a second Trump administration.


Colby also said the United States may not be able to live up to its defense commitments to South Korea if North Korea can conduct nuclear attacks on American cities.


“We need to have clarity between ourselves and our own thinking so we come up with a strategy and force posture … that actually mitigates this threat from North Korea,” Colby said.


While analysts have long questioned whether the United States would really sacrifice an American city to save that of a U.S. ally, Colby’s comments stand in sharp contrast to those of U.S. officials, who regularly insist that the U.S. defense commitment to Seoul is “ironclad.”


“Those kinds of simple statements can seriously undermine the U.S. commitment to defend allies,” said Park, who predicts a “huge wave” of nuclear advocacy in Seoul if such comments continue.


Actions or words?


Not all Trump allies support South Korea getting nuclear weapons.


One of those who opposes the idea is Alex Gray, chief of staff in Trump’s White House National Security Council. In an interview with VOA, Gray rejected the notion that Trump should serve as a rationale for any U.S. ally, including South Korea, to acquire nuclear weapons.


“I would really encourage everyone to look at the policies that came out of the first Trump administration — not just the media reporting, not just language and statements,” Gray said.


In Gray’s estimation, Trump was only trying to drive a hard bargain in military cost-sharing negotiations so that the alliance could become more beneficial to the United States.




But Gray also hinted at tensions ahead — especially after U.S. and South Korean officials last week launched early negotiations on a new military cost-sharing arrangement, 20 months before the current six-year deal expires.


The negotiations, which have been characterized by some media as an attempt to “Trump-proof” the alliance, show a “lack of respect” for Trump, Gray said.


Robert Rapson, who served as a senior U.S. diplomat in Seoul during Trump’s terms, said the cost-sharing negotiations and other efforts to “mitigate the risks” of a second Trump presidency are “fully understandable” but also risky.


“I would suggest that ROK officialdom not let its angst over the uncertainty drive them to take preemptive actions that don’t necessarily help them with Trump and may even backfire,” he said.


Rapson, however, cautions anyone from feeling too sure about how Trump might act toward South Korea.


“The only real certainty about a prospective second Trump administration,” he said, “is that there will be a high degree of uncertainty.”

## Biden administration: 100,000 new migrants expected to enroll in 'Obamacare' next year

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Roughly 100,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children are expected to enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health insurance next year under a directive the Biden administration released Friday.


The move took longer than promised to finalize and fell short of Democratic President Joe Biden's initial proposal to allow those migrants to sign up for Medicaid, the health insurance program that provides nearly free coverage for the nation's poorest people.


But it will allow thousands of people, known as "Dreamers," to access tax breaks when they sign up for coverage after the Affordable Care Act's marketplace enrollment opens Nov. 1, just days ahead of the presidential election.


"I'm proud of the contributions of Dreamers to our country and committed to providing Dreamers the support they need to succeed," Biden said in a statement Friday.


While it may help Biden boost his appeal at a crucial time among Latinos, a crucial voting bloc that he needs to turn out to win the election, the move is certain to prompt more criticism among conservatives about the president's border and migrant policies.


The action opens the marketplace to any participant in the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, many of whom are Latino.


Xavier Becerra, the nation's top health official, said Thursday that many of those migrants have delayed getting care because they have not had coverage.


"They incur higher costs and debts when they do finally receive care," Becerra told reporters on a call. "Making Dreamers eligible to enroll in coverage will improve their health and well-being and strengthen the health and well-being of our nation and our economy."


The administration's action changes the definition of "lawfully present" so DACA participants can legally enroll in the marketplace exchange.


Then-President Barack Obama launched the DACA initiative to shield from deportation immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children and to allow them to work legally in the country. However, the "Dreamers" were still ineligible for government-subsidized health insurance programs because they did not meet the definition of having a "lawful presence" in the U.S.


The administration decided not to expand eligibility for Medicaid for those migrants after receiving more than 20,000 comments on the proposal, senior officials said Thursday. Those officials declined to explain why the rule, which was first proposed last April, took so long to finalize. The delay meant the migrants were unable to enroll in the marketplace for coverage this year.


At one point, there were as many as 800,000 people enrolled in DACA at one time, though now that figure is roughly 580,000. The administration predicts only 100,000 will actually sign up because some may get coverage through their workplaces or other ways. Some may also be unable to afford coverage through the marketplace.


Other classes of immigrants, including asylum seekers and people with temporary protected status, are already eligible to purchase insurance through the marketplaces of the ACA, Obama's 2010 health care law, often called "Obamacare."


The president last year also unveiled a regulation that was aimed at fending off legal challenges to DACA; former President Donald Trump tried to end it, and it has bounced back and forth in federal court. Last fall, a federal judge said the current version can continue at least temporarily.


"President Biden and I will continue to do everything in our power to protect DACA, but it is only a temporary solution," Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement. "Congress must act to ensure Dreamers have the permanent protections they deserve."

## Why I’ve Finally Lost Faith in Tesla

First were the people shouting, incorrectly, that IPA is a bad style of beer and framing themselves as too hip to sip something so basic. Second: Posts from the loud, dedicated cadre of Threads users who are actively rooting against Tesla.</p>
<p>I understand the spite. When I bought my Model 3 five years ago, Elon Musk had begun his public heel turn. Some of the signs of what was to come were already there. However, Model 3 was the best reasonably affordable EV on the market, and the Supercharger network made it possible for us (California residents as we are) to own only an electric vehicle. You couldn’t say that for the electric Hyundai Kona.</p>
<p>In the time since then, Musk’s erratic or adolescent behavior has caused a rising tide of people, especially among the very online and the political left, to openly hope for and celebrate Tesla’s failures. I have not been among them. Musk’s brand was the best bet for getting Americans to quit internal combustion, a goal that’s more important to me than the man’s personal failings. Nor did I believe declarations that the company was doomed. No matter what crazy thing Elon Musk devoted his money or his attention to, it seemed like Tesla’s dominance in both the EV market and the stock market could paint over the crazy.</p>
<p>Now, I’m not so sure.</p>
<p>Last month, we covered the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-robotaxi" target="_self"><u>big problems</u></a> with Tesla’s EV lineup. The only new vehicle released since 2020 was the Cybertruck, which is suffering through slow sales and a sudden unintended acceleration <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-cybertruck-recall" target="_self"><u>crisis</u></a>. The sub-$30,000 model that would open up Tesla to the masses was <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-2" target="_self"><u>sort of canceled</u></a>, then <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-q1-2024-earnings" target="_self"><u>sort of uncanceled</u></a>, and now sits in limbo. Whatever that car’s fate, it’s clear that Musk is obsessed with self-driving software and his “robotaxi” at the expense of EVs actually driven by their human occupants.</p>
<p>But if a self-inflicted wound proves fatal, it might be the one Musk created this week by <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-layoffs" target="_self"><u>laying off</u></a> essentially the entire team in charge of Tesla’s Supercharger network. That includes <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-layoffs-musk" target="_self"><u>Rebecca Tinucci</u></a>, his senior director of EV charging, who led the effort starting in 2022 to convince the other automakers to adopt Tesla’s formerly proprietary plug standard as their own.</p>
<p>Tinucci’s achievement was one of the company’s few undisputed success stories during the past several years of chaos. One by one, the other automakers ditched plug standards that were supported by third-party charging companies like EVgo and Electrify America to adopt the Tesla plug, which was christened the North American Charging Standard. Ford and Rivian EVs have begun this year to use a big part of Tesla’s robust Supercharger network. I cannot tell you how many excited, targeted Instagram ads I’ve gotten from Rivian celebrating the new access.</p>
<p><a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-ford-gm" target="_self"><u>This was a huge deal</u></a> for American EV adoption. Tesla’s fast-chargers are <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-national-parks-charging" target="_self"><u>widespread</u></a>, simple to use, and far more reliable than the oft-busted charging stations other EVs previously had to rely on. And it was a huge deal for Tesla, which created out of nowhere a huge new customer base ready to pay for its electricity.</p>
<p>And now, at what should be a moment of triumph at winning the charging wars, Musk has pivoted away. He <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1785406795814510785" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>wrote</u></a> on his social network formerly named Twitter: “Tesla still plans to grow the Supercharger network, just at a slower pace for new locations and more focus on 100% uptime and expansion of existing locations.”</p>
<p>Frankly, this sounds like an attempt to hand-wave away a spectacular self-own. As <em><em>The Verge</em></em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145621/tesla-layoff-supercharger-ev-charging-nacs-elon-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>: “Station installations were up 26% year over year, while the number of connectors was up 27%. It was a rare area of growth for the company, which has seen its sales and profits fall since last year as demand for EVs cools down.” In trying to become lean and innovative, all Musk managed to do was kneecap a part of Tesla that’s actually working.</p><p>The company has to keep making money while Musk busies himself with trying to solve AI and autonomous driving. What with its inattention to its EV lineup and shooting itself in the foot over Supercharging, suddenly the winning options are few. Tesla’s other business is in home energy, where it installs solar panels and sells its <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/11/tesla-details-powerwall-3-cheaper-stack/" target="_blank"><u>Powerwall</u></a> home batteries. This is a lucrative market as energy storage becomes increasingly important to the grid and home of the future — unless Musk decides that, like selling cars, it’s too boring.<br/></p>
<p>Given its huge lead in EV sales and EV charging, Tesla is forever just a few good decisions away from trending upward again. It’s just getting more difficult each day to imagine the company doing so.</p>

The committee has prioritized directing the funds toward the PAC ahead of the Republican National Committee (though these donations are still subject to the $5,000 annual individual contribution limit).</p><p>Fossil fuel interests “have made it super clear that they are willing to help pay Trump’s legal defense to help keep him out of jail,” Alex Witt, senior advisor on oil and gas for the strategic communications group Climate Power, told Lange.</p><h3>2. Other Republican candidates rake in oil and gas funds</h3><p>Meanwhile, the oil and gas industry is also pouring money into other federal campaigns, <a href="https://capitalandmain.com/u-s-oil-and-gas-production-is-booming-so-are-the-industrys-donations-to-its-gop-allies?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y22o6ogrUIahxa01Q9CF_MCKTV75hqBBmXAYK961q7c5ftsRP2QgaXpC9sB4cpRcb-6a-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Capital & Main</em> reported</a>. The candidate who has received the most oil and gas money so far this election cycle is August Pfluger, a Republican from Texas, who represents the 11th congressional district in the central part of the state. Pfluger is not in a tight reelection race but has been a consistent ally of the industry, including by challenging the Biden administration’s suspension of new liquefied natural gas export licenses. So far this election cycle, oil and gas interests have contributed seven times more money to Republicans and conservatives than to Democrats and liberals, campaign finance data from <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus?cycle=2024&ind=E01%20%20&utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y22o6ogrUIahxa01Q9CF_MCKTV75hqBBmXAYK961q7c5ftsRP2QgaXpC9sB4cpRcb-6a-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Open Secrets</a> shows.

Treasury releases final EV tax credit eligibility</h3><p>The Treasury Department and the Department of Energy finalized rules that determine which EVs are eligible for the $7,500 consumer tax credit and $4,000 used vehicle tax credit on Friday. More specifically, the rules govern what percentage of battery components and critical minerals have to be sourced from the U.S. or our trade allies, how to determine whether those components were made by a “<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ev-tax-credit-china-rule-2024?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y22o6ogrUIahxa01Q9CF_MCKTV75hqBBmXAYK961q7c5ftsRP2QgaXpC9sB4cpRcb-6a-" target="_self">foreign entity of concern</a>,” and how manufacturers must document their sourcing to the government. The administration made only minor adjustments to the initial guidance released last year, such as a requirement to conduct more detailed critical mineral supply chain tracing beginning in 2027.</p><p>This is important news for automakers, who will have a more complete picture moving forward of the investments they’ll need to make in new supply chains and domestic manufacturing to ensure their vehicles qualify. For consumers, though, it won’t change much. The administration isn’t anticipating any immediate changes in the number of eligible vehicles, and buyers will still be able to claim the tax credit as a rebate off the listing price at the dealership, a program that started at the beginning of this year.</p><h3>4. U.S. concerned about Chinese offshore nuclear</h3><p>China is taking steps toward putting floating nuclear reactors in the South China Sea, the <em>Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/05/02/china-floating-nuclear-reactor-military/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y22o6ogrUIahxa01Q9CF_MCKTV75hqBBmXAYK961q7c5ftsRP2QgaXpC9sB4cpRcb-6a-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>. Chinese state media has said that the reactors would power military facilities there, according to U.S. officials, and though the reactors are likely still several years away from being built, the plan is ringing alarm bells. “Our concern is that the closer they get to deploying floating nuclear power plants, the faster they’ll use them for purposes contrary to the national security of the United States and broader security in the region,” an unnamed senior State Department official told the <em>Post</em>.</p><p>Many countries are <a href="https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/floating-nuclear-power-plants-benefits-and-challenges-discussed-at-iaea-symposium?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y22o6ogrUIahxa01Q9CF_MCKTV75hqBBmXAYK961q7c5ftsRP2QgaXpC9sB4cpRcb-6a-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">working on</a> floating reactor designs, but most such projects are still in development. International standards have not been established for the reactors’ construction or safe operation.</p><h3>5. U.S. oil and gas heavyweight accused of OPEC collusion </h3><p><span></span>The Federal Trade Commission on Thursday <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/05/ftc-order-bans-former-pioneer-ceo-exxon-board-seat-exxon-pioneer-deal?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y22o6ogrUIahxa01Q9CF_MCKTV75hqBBmXAYK961q7c5ftsRP2QgaXpC9sB4cpRcb-6a-" target="_blank">approved</a> oil giant Exxon Mobil’s acquisition of Permian Basin extraction company Pioneer Natural Resources — but only if the latter company’s founder and CEO, Scott Sheffield, refrained from taking a seat on the board. In doing so, the FTC accused Sheffield of colluding with OPEC, the organization that sets output levels for many of the world’s biggest oil producers. The goal of his cooperation, the agency said, was to “reduce output of oil and gas, which would result in Americans paying higher prices at the pump, to inflate profits for his company.” Pioneer issued a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/02/energy/oil-ceo-opec-scott-sheffield/index.html?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y22o6ogrUIahxa01Q9CF_MCKTV75hqBBmXAYK961q7c5ftsRP2QgaXpC9sB4cpRcb-6a-" target="_blank">statement</a> saying it was surprised by the FTC’s claim and disagreed with its contention, but that it would not take any steps to prevent the merger from closing.</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>The first of two NASA satellites that will study the relationship between Earth’s poles and climate change could launch as soon as May 22, according to <a href="https://www.space.com/rocket-lab-back-to-back-nasa-climate-change-launches-prefire?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_Y22o6ogrUIahxa01Q9CF_MCKTV75hqBBmXAYK961q7c5ftsRP2QgaXpC9sB4cpRcb-6a-" target="_blank">Space.com</a>.

<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>My name is Cory Dransfeldt and I'm located in Camarillo, California (a suburban town north of Los Angeles and where I grew up). I studied business in college and minored in economics. At the time I thought it was a practical choice and I was also terrified of the math involved in studying computer science. In hindsight, I wish I'd made a different choice, but don't necessarily regret the one I made at the time.</p>
<p>My first job out of college was working on the website of the local newspaper (I started as a freelance employee during college and became full-time after). This role was focused on updating the website with content the night before the print edition became available and was done in a utilitarian, but reliable Django-based CMS. I picked up some basic front end development knowledge working on multimedia projects and building my own tools to make the job easier.</p>
<p>I began to learn JavaScript by writing themes for <a href="http://bowtieapp.com/">Bowtie</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoute">Ecoute</a> as part of the MacThemes forum community. I expanded my web development knowledge by volunteering to build websites for metal bands I remain a fan of and friends with like <a href="https://linktr.ee/cyniconline">Cynic</a> and <a href="https://augurymetal.com/">Augury</a>. I gained a lot of knowledge and ended up with merch, concert tickets and some really great experiences out if it all.</p>
<p>I've built a career out of being a self-taught frontend-focused developer and have worked at startups, nationally recognized retailers (I've worked on every eCommerce stack short of Shopify) and several different SaaS providers. The backend developer I worked with at my first startup told me to learn languages and pickup frameworks as needed — that advice continues to serve me well.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, programming and blogging remain my favorite hobbies, along with searching for and discovering new music (I enjoy everything from artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits">Tom Waits</a> to punk acts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomeansno">NoMeansNo</a> and myriad death metal artists like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcass_(band)">Carcass</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy_(band)">Autopsy</a> and newer groups like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Mold">Tomb Mold</a>). If I'm not at the computer, I'm spending time with my lovely wife of 9 years, our two children and our 4 rescue dogs (all terrier/chihuahua mixes). I also mentor via <a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org/">Underdog Devs</a> and help organize the <a href="https://11tymeetup.dev/">Eleventy meetup</a>. I've been getting tattooed more over the past few years and am in the process of completing a sleeve on my right arm but am not sure that qualifies as a hobby.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I started blogging after I graduated from college in 2010 and have managed to recover posts dating back to 2013 that I've imported into the current iteration on my site. I was inspired by blogs like Daring Fireball and MacStories, though I don't follow them quite as closely as I once did. I viewed blogging as both a creative outlet and as a way to continue practicing web development by having my own project to experiment on and iterate with.</p>
<p>I started out on Tumblr, before moving to the first version of Kirby, then on to Statamic, Jekyll, Next.js, <a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>'s weblog service and now, finally (and quite happily) <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. All of these presented me with an opportunity to learn new languages, frameworks, tools and development approaches. I love the simplicity and flexibility of Eleventy and adore the community around both it and omg.lol. I like the simplicity of blogging under my own name and settled on a domain name that reflects both that and the development/technology focus.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>My creative process tends to be very informal — I read a lot of articles via the blogs I follow through RSS and enjoy both audio and written books. I'm interested in web development, the state of the industry and music, so my posts typically center around those topics (and, occasionally, how they connect or overlap). I'll often write a single draft, edit it for clarity, brevity and correctness before my confidence in the post wanes and publish it.</p>
<p>I want to grow into doing more research-focused writing to compliment these briefer pieces and am excited about that approach as an area where I can grow as a writer.</p>
<p>I write posts in markdown using <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a> and then insert Eleventy frontmatter that I store as a snippet in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I typically write in an office that I share with my wife — I work from home and have a corner desk with my personal machine (a typically docked M2 MacBook Air), work machine and a lightly-used TV in between. I struggle to concentrate in silence and will typically write and program with death or black metal playing. I find the music helps me focus and the lack of intelligible lyrics keeps it from distracting me.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>My blog is hosted at Netlify and I pay for the pro plan while staying well under its limits, but this allows me the piece of mind to rebuild the site regularly to update <a href="https://coryd.dev/now">my now page</a> and other dynamically populated elements like <a href="https://coryd.dev/links/">my links page</a>.</p>
<p>I moved my domains to DNSimple last year after Gandi was acquired.</p>
<p>The code for my site is versioned and <a href="https://github.com/cdransf/coryd.dev">available to view at GitHub</a>. I use a GitHub action to trigger hourly rebuilds of my site, another to post content from a feed that combines my blog posts, shared links, read books and watched movies to Mastodon, another to add my blog posts to my README, another to test my site's performance using a <a href="https://speedlify.coryd.dev/">Speedlify instance</a> and yet another to retrieve and cache the chart data for music I've listened to over the last week from <a href="https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/building-a-scrobbler-using-plex-webhooks-edge-functions-and-blob-storage/">the charts I derive from Plex</a> (this is then syndicated to Mastodon via the aforementioned feed and action).</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>If I were to start a blog today, I suppose I'd start from where I've arrived at now, but I don't think I could've arrived here without the experience and discovery I went through along the way. I'm not a particularly great designer, so I favor simplicity and performance in presentation and, from a technical perspective, 11ty really lends itself to that. I think I've found a set of tools and a community that I deeply enjoy engaging with.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>The expenses to run my site are fairly straightforward: hosting (Netlify), analytics (Clicky) and feed hosting/analytics (Feedpress). A quick estimate for a given year would be around $400 which I'm happy with for something I enjoy so much. There's also a tiny fee monthly for a Backblaze B2 bucket I use to cache JSON used to populate my links page (they're fetched from the Readwise Reader API which is paginated and rate-limited — this allows me to persist link data and puts less of a burden on their service).</p>
<p>I'm not opposed to bloggers monetizing their sites, but I appreciate when, say, content is clearly marked as sponsored. I have a Buy Me a Coffee link in my site's navigation, but nothing outside of that — if someone wants to send something along I appreciate it and, if not, that's totally fine too!</p>
<p>I support a few larger publications that started on and have since left Substack. Among my favorites are Paris Marx's <a href="https://disconnect.blog/">Disconnect</a> and <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day</a>.</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>
<p>I'll start off by saying I <em>love</em> the resurgence of blogs and personal sites we're seeing. I have a <a href="https://coryd.dev/blogroll">blogroll</a> on my site with some of my favorites (they're also bundled into a .opml file that you can download). <a href="https://rknight.me/">Robb Knight</a>'s blog remains one of my favorites — the design is stellar and he's constantly experimenting with and adding new features. I also thoroughly enjoy <a href="https://notes.neatnik.net/">Adam Newbold</a>'s writing and seeing what he's working on for omg.lol. I could go on and on I love <a href="https://gkeenan.co/avgb">Keenan</a>'s writing, <a href="https://blog.mayank.co/">Mayank</a> is a gifted developer and similarly talented writer, <a href="https://sarajoy.dev/">Sara Joy</a> is exceedingly kind and has created awesome projects like <a href="https://rs.sjoy.lol/">RS.S JOY.lol dev</a>. The internet's changing and seeing everyone writing and building makes me so happy.</p>
<h2>Final question: is there anything you want to share with us?</h2>
<p>If you want to mentor some great, deserving folks, check out <a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org/">Underdog Devs</a>. If you're building with Eleventy we'd love to have you <a href="https://11tymeetup.dev/">present at the meetup</a>. The best book I've finished this year has been <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/05de5de3-3572-4d50-b70e-651909502ca1"><em>NoMeansNo: From Obscurity to Oblivion</em></a> — they're my favorite band so, naturally,  I'm biased, but it's a fun read and is built around interviews with the band, their friends, family and other popular musicians. </p>
<p>I don't have any active side projects at the moment (but I'm kicking around some ideas) — fitting everything in is tough! I'd love to build something that makes it easier for small bands to quickly build lightweight websites that they can host anywhere and really bring my journey full circle — a static site generator as a service with portable code and easy CMS integration?  More robust than LinkTree, with less overhead than Squarespace and more open than both. I'm more interested in supporting musicians than I am in monetizing anything I suppose.</p>
<p>I'm also excited to see what Robb Knight is cooking up with <a href="https://echofeed.app/">EchoFeed</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! I post a lot on <a href="https://coryd.dev/">my site</a> and on <a href="https://social.lol/@cory">Mastodon</a> so come say hi!</p>

## The Oil Money Funding Trump’s Legal Defense

date: 2024-05-03, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE1OTkyMS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MjcxMzY0OX0.ANfaIf1ngLDKeN23KdDn73arg2HyQrXWJ4m43QDCD0c/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">With $6.4 million, you could pay to <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/climeworks-orca-data-carbon-removal-direct-air-capture" target="_self"><u>remove</u></a> 4,923 tons of carbon from the atmosphere. You could buy 533 <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/chevy-bolt-used-range-price-value-chevrolet" target="_self"><u>used Chevy Bolts</u></a> — far more than enough to give one to every incoming freshman at Swarthmore College — or supply an entire county with <a href="https://www.cortezmasto.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cortez-masto-announces-64-million-for-clean-buses-in-washoe-county/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>low- and no-emissions buses</u></a>.</p>
<p>Or, if you’re the oil and gas industry, you could donate it to the former president of the United States to help cover his mounting legal fees.</p>
<p>According to new analysis by the strategic communications group Climate Power, allies of Big Oil pumped more than $6.4 million into Donald Trump’s joint fundraising committee in just the first three months of 2024 — on pace to surpass the $6.9 million the industry contributed in all of 2023. “From the private equity firm execs to investors to anti-climate activists like Linda McMahon, Trump’s Small Business administrator — they all want Trump to undo our climate and clean energy progress,” Alex Witt, Climate Power’s senior advisor on oil and gas, told me. “And they want their jobs back.”</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the oil and gas industry has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/11/10/trump-oil-gas-donors-climate/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bolstered Trump’s money-strapped campaign</u></a>. The recent slate of donations to a fundraising vehicle called the Trump 47 Committee, has allowed the former president to accept large checks from individuals and prioritize the allotment of those funds. In this way, the Trump 47 Committee works like a one-stop shop for well-heeled supporters like Linda McMahon, formerly Trump’s Small Business Administration head and a vocal proponent and investor in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220123133244/https://www.journalinquirer.com/page_one/mcmahon-has-stake-in-oil-pipeline-plan-she-supports/article_7a0531a9-29ce-503b-ac4b-0dc314bd0c56.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the Keystone XL pipeline</u></a> and <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/linda-mcmahon-connecticut_n_576301" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promoter of offshore drilling</u></a>, and Kelcy Warren, the billionaire CEO of the pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners. Both maxed out the committee’s $814,600 allowed contribution.</p>
<p>Trump 47 is technically a joint fundraising committee, a type of entity allowed by the Federal Election Commission to bundle donations going to multiple channels. This is nice for donors, who can cut a single check that then gets divided among various buckets — in this case, the Trump campaign, the Save America PAC, the RNC, and 39 different state committees, in that sequence. Critics say this form of fundraising is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/04/17/campaign-spending-megadonors-joint-fundraising-committees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a way around election laws</u></a> that aim to limit how much a wealthy individual can donate to a given candidate. Importantly, super PACs <em><em>can’t</em></em> donate to candidates or their campaigns, or <a href="https://campaignlegal.org/update/super-pacs-cant-coordinate-candidates-heres-what-happened-when-one-did" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coordinate things like messaging with them</u></a>; the money raised by a joint fundraising committee <em><em>is</em></em> directed by a candidate (including into PACs), giving them fuller influence over the donations. (Joe Biden uses joint fundraising committees, too.)</p>
<p>The Trump 47 Committee has <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/03/21/trumps-invite-to-major-donors-prioritizes-the-committee-paying-his-legal-bills-over-the-rnc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prioritized</u></a> funneling these donations toward a PAC that covers the president’s legal fees, rather than toward the Republican National Committee, which is <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/republican-national-committee-finances-money-limos-1854842" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>also struggling financially</u></a>. While this strategy does not allow donors to get around the individual contribution limit of $5,000 per year to a political action committee, it <em><em>does</em></em> mean that after the first $6,600 of a donation made to the Trump 47 Committee (which goes toward Trump’s primary and general election accounts), the subsequent $5,000 of each donation is earmarked for the Save America PAC. </p>
<p>As a “leadership PAC,” Save America can’t be used on Trump’s campaign activities; instead, it is structured to cover administrative expenses. That has kept it plenty busy: The PAC has covered fees for 70 different lawyers and law firms, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/24/trump-super-pac-funds-save-america-spending/73026734007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>USA Today</em></em></u><u> reports</u></a>, with legal spending making up about 85% of its overall use. Between January and the end of March, Save America put <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/03/21/trumps-invite-to-major-donors-prioritizes-the-committee-paying-his-legal-bills-over-the-rnc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a total of $8.5 million</u></a> toward Trump’s legal woes, including $5.5 million in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-biden-campaign-fundraising-february-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>March alone</u></a>. (Fossil fuel allies have also <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/02/02/oil-industry-backs-trump-with-big-money-1-00139227" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>donated large amounts</u></a> to MAGA Inc., a PAC that has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/20/trump-legal-bills-fundraising-reports/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>refunded millions</u></a> to Save America.) </p>
<p>The higher donation limits of a JFC make it more appealing for supporters who want to cut big checks, and most individuals quickly pass the $6,600 threshold. In my review of the 30 oil and gas industry executives, investors, and allies who donated to the Trump 47 Committee, according to Climate Power, I found none who donated less than $100,000.</p><p>The Trump campaign has been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-campaign-fundraising-rnc-c0e8f1e7b59f70c5237e13a3462e5790" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quick to defend itself</u></a> against allegations that it is prioritizing ex-president over party by pointing out that “out of an individual donor’s maximum contribution of $824,600, less than 1% goes to Save America.”<strong> </strong>(The Trump campaign had not replied to Heatmap’s request for comment by press time.) It’s true that of the $6.4 million Big Oil allies donated to the Trump 47 Committee this year, roughly 2% has ended up in Save America’s coffers, per my own back of the envelope math.</p>
<p>What’s shocking isn’t how much money this amounts to in the grand scheme of the obscene amounts of capital going toward defending Trump, however. Rather, it’s that oil and gas allies — including Ray Washburn, on Sunoco’s board of directors; <a href="https://yorktownenergy.com/team/peter-leidel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Peter Leidel</u></a>, an oil and coal company director; and Robert Mercer, who’s <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mercers-trump-climate-denial_n_5c76b643e4b0031d9564572e" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>funded</u></a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/08/greenpeace-exposes-sceptics-cast-doubt-climate-science" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>climate misinformation</u></a> — have given <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-09/trump-got-7-4m-from-energy-sector-donors-making-him-their-2024-pick" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>gobs of money to</u></a> help defeat criminal charges against a former holder of, and candidate for, the presidency of the United States. For this there is no precedent. Fossil fuel interests “have made it super clear that they are willing to help pay Trump’s legal defense to help keep him out of jail,” Witt told me.</p>
<p>As an especially ironic footnote, Biden has <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/01/30/biden-administration-oil-drilling-permits-outpace-trump-ee-00138376" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in certain senses</u></a> been <em><em>better</em></em> for the oil and gas industry than his predecessor. A <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-energy-202/2019/01/09/the-energy-202-oil-industry-worries-about-trump-trade-and-shutdown-standoffs/5c34f4101b326b66fc5a1be3/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>more unpredictable leader</u></a>, Trump was evidently a second or third choice among for many of the fossil fuel industry’s biggest donors among the crowded field of Republican candidates, both in 2016 and this time around. Oil and gas magnate Harold Hamm, for example, initially <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/harold-hamm-gives-to-trump-after-avoiding-him/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>avoided</u></a> committing to a Trump second term — only to come around to such an extent that he was even rumored to have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/billionaires-sought-help-fund-trump-bond-civil-fraud-case-sources-say-2024-03-26/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>helped the former president meet</u></a> his recent $454 million bond.</p>
<p>It’s, frankly, a canny move. Plenty has already been written about Big Oil effectively <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/meet-the-top-house-recipients-of-oil-and-gas-money/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buying influence over policy</u></a>. Just yesterday, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who has received <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2022/08/20/fact-check-did-ron-johnson-take-700000-from-fossil-fuel-industry/65410713007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$750,000</u></a> from the fossil fuel industry since his election in 2010, <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/oil-hearing-exxon-bp-chevron-shell" target="_self"><u>pulled the Senate’s Big Oil disinformation hearing off track</u></a> by ranting about “climate change alarmism.” </p>
<p>It doesn’t take much creativity to imagine <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>what Trump might do</u></a> for his friends if he retakes the highest office.</p>
<p>“There’s absolutely no doubt that he would deliver Big Oil’s wish list wrapped up in a bow,” Witt said.</p>

## Russian troops enter base housing US military in Niger, US official says

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — Russian military personnel have entered an air base in Niger that is hosting U.S. troops, a senior U.S. defense official told Reuters, a move that follows a decision by Niger's junta to expel U.S. forces.


The military officers ruling the West African nation have told the U.S. to withdraw its nearly 1,000 military personnel from the country, which until a coup last year had been a key partner for Washington's fight against insurgents who have killed thousands of people and displaced millions more.


A senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Russian forces were not mingling with U.S. troops but were using a separate hangar at Airbase 101, which is next to Diori Hamani International Airport in Niamey, Niger's capital.


The move by Russia's military, which Reuters was the first to report, puts U.S. and Russian troops in close proximity at a time when the nations' military and diplomatic rivalry is increasingly acrimonious over the conflict in Ukraine.


It also raises questions about the fate of U.S. installations in the country following a withdrawal. "(The situation) is not great but in the short-term manageable," the official said.


Asked about the Reuters report, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin played down any risk to American troops or the chance that Russian troops might get close to U.S. military hardware.


"The Russians are in a separate compound and don't have access to U.S. forces or access to our equipment," Austin told a press conference in Honolulu.


"I'm always focused on the safety and protection of our troops ... But right now, I don't see a significant issue here in terms of our force protection."


The Nigerien and Russian embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.




The U.S. and its allies have been forced to move troops out of a number of African countries following coups that brought to power groups eager to distance themselves from Western governments. In addition to the impending departure from Niger, U.S. troops have also left Chad in recent days, while French forces have been kicked out of Mali and Burkina Faso.


At the same time, Russia is seeking to strengthen relations with African nations, pitching Moscow as a friendly country with no colonial baggage in the continent.


Mali, for example, has in recent years become one of Russia's closest African allies, with the Wagner Group mercenary force deploying there to fight jihadist insurgents.


Russia has described relations with the United States as "below zero" because of U.S. military and financial aid for Ukraine in its effort to defend against invading Russian forces.


The U.S. official said Nigerien authorities had told President Joe Biden's administration that about 60 Russian military personnel would be in Niger, but the official could not verify that number.


After the coup, the U.S. military moved some of its forces in Niger from Airbase 101 to Airbase 201 in the city of Agadez.


It was not immediately clear what U.S. military equipment remained at Airbase 101.


The United States built Airbase 201 in central Niger at a cost of more than $100 million. Since 2018 it has been used to target Islamic State and al Qaeda affiliate Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen (JNIM) fighters with armed drones.


Washington is concerned about Islamic militants in the Sahel region, who may be able to expand without the presence of U.S. forces and intelligence capabilities.


Niger's move to ask for the removal of U.S. troops came after a meeting in Niamey in mid-March, when senior U.S. officials raised concerns including the expected arrival of Russia forces and reports of Iran seeking raw materials in the country, including uranium.


While the U.S. message to Nigerien officials was not an ultimatum, the official said, it was made clear U.S. forces could not be on a base with Russian forces.


"They did not take that well," the official said.


A two-star U.S. general has been sent to Niger to try to arrange a professional and responsible withdrawal.


While no decisions have been taken on the future of U.S. troops in Niger, the official said the plan was for them to return to U.S. Africa Command's home bases, located in Germany.

## May 2, 2024 

date: 2024-05-03, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

More than 2,000 people have been arrested at protests on college and university campuses around the country opposing Israel&#8217;s military strikes on Gaza since the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas, and the subsequent humanitarian crisis there. It is unclear how many of the protesters are students, as many of those arrested have not been affiliated with the universities, or how many of the arrests will result in charges&#8212;sometimes arrests at protests are designed simply to clear an area.

Friends, From time to time, I share with you some of my personal history so that you understand where my values come from. The late 1960s was a time of experimentation &#8212; &#8220;sex, drugs, and rock-and-roll&#8221; and a lot more. The giant baby-boom generation was heading out into the world that seemed to many of us to be nuts. Some of us joined cults. Others, urban communes. Others, utopian communities in the countryside.

## Austin: US sees no indications of intent to hurt US troops building Gaza pier

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

Washington — U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said late Thursday he does not see signs that Hamas is going to attack U.S. forces who are building a pier off the coast of Gaza to deliver aid to the war-torn strip by sea.


"I don't see any indications currently that there is an active intent to do that," Austin told reporters at a press conference in Hawaii.


Austin stressed that the top commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, CENTCOM chief Gen. Erik Kurilla, has put several security measures in place to keep the troops who are building the pier and helping with aid distribution safe.


"Our allies are also providing security in that area as well, and so it's going to require that we continue to coordinate with them very closely to ensure that if anything happens that, you know, our troops are protected," Austin said.


The new port is just southwest of Gaza City. Last week a mortar attack targeted the port site but officials said no one was hurt.


"This is an accident, a very serious accident waiting to happen," Bradley Bowman, the senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told VOA.


Bowman, who is also a U.S. Army veteran, said Thursday that efforts to feed those in desperate need are "laudable," but security concerns since the inception of this U.S. mission appear to remain unanswered while some of the plans are still being developed.


"The kind of terrorists, the kind of person – I hesitate to use that term – that would … wage the October 7 terror attack, use human shields and hold innocent men, women and children as hostages, those are the very same people that will not hesitate to attack those trying to bring food and water to hungry and thirsty people," Bowman said.


Crews from the USNS Roy P. Benavidez and several Army vessels started building the floating platform for the operation last week, according to a senior military official. Next will come construction of the causeway, which will be anchored to the shore by the Israel Defense Forces.


U.S. and Israeli officials have said they hope to complete construction and begin operations this month.


The senior military official told reporters the Pentagon expects deliveries to "begin at about 90 trucks a day … and then quickly increase to 150 trucks a day."


Aid has been slow to get into Gaza because of long backups of vehicles at Israeli inspection points. The U.S. and other nations have been air-dropping food into Gaza, but each military plane only holds about one to three truckloads of food, a U.S. official told VOA.


Aid organizations have said several hundred truckloads of food are needed in Gaza each day.


Israel attacked Hamas in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7 terror attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people and saw hundreds more taken hostage. In the nearly seven months since the attack, more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to Gazan health officials.

## US remains committed to diplomacy despite North Korea’s nuclear escalation

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

washington — The U.S. says it has been trying to engage North Korea by sending messages repeatedly despite Pyongyang’s apparent lack of interest in dialogue and its escalation of threats in the region.


“We have sent such messages in multiple ways – through third parties and directly, orally and in writing – and have included specific proposals on humanitarian cooperation and other topics for discussion,” a State Department spokesperson said.


“We have also emphasized our willingness to discuss practical steps both sides could take to address the security situation in the region,” the spokesperson continued via email to VOA’s Korean Service on April 26.


“To date, however, the DPRK has shown no indication it is interested in engaging. Instead, we have seen a marked increase in the scope and scale of DPRK provocations, which have only served to raise regional tensions and increase the risk of accidental or unintentional escalation,” the spokesperson added.


North Korea’s official name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.


North Korea has been conducting multiple missile and rocket tests, including what it said was its first nuclear counterattack drills using “super-large” artillery rockets carrying mock nuclear warheads on April 22.




Pyongyang has also ramped up its cooperation with Russia, sending arms to support Moscow's fight against Ukraine. Russia has been shipping refined petroleum to North Korea above the limit of 500,000 barrels annually set by the U.N. Security Council, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Thursday.


The North Korean mission to the U.N. did not respond to a VOA inquiry on its reaction to the U.S. description of its efforts made to resume talks.


Dialogue between the two has been deadlocked since October 2019 when working-level talks failed to reconcile differences over denuclearization and sanctions relief that became apparent a few months earlier at a summit in Hanoi.




Washington has maintained that it is open to renewed dialogue on Pyongyang’s nuclear program without preconditions.


Former U.S. officials suggested that the Biden administration provided the unusually detailed account of its efforts to engage Pyongyang in response to criticisms saying it has not done enough.


“The Biden team is quite sensitive to the attacks coming from 'liberals,' especially critics who claim the administration has not attached sufficient priority to North Korea and has not done enough to pursue diplomacy with Pyongyang,” said Evans Revere, a former State Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea.


Revere added that some of these critics are arguing that Washington needs to change its approach, offer concessions and engage in arms control and threat reduction talks with North Korea. He said this explains not only the administration’s detailed description of its efforts at talks but its willingness to discuss “interim steps” toward denuclearization.


Two senior U.S. officials said in March that Washington is willing to consider such steps and discuss sanctions and confidence-building measures.




Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said the Biden administration may be trying to address China’s call for talks between Washington and Pyongyang.


“It’s possible Beijing may have laid out a quid pro quo for any support with North Korea by calling on the U.S. to up its efforts to engage with Pyongyang – hence the statement” from the State Department, said Rapson.


Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at a news conference in Beijing after talks with Chinese officials that he “encouraged” Beijing “to press Pyongyang to end its dangerous behavior and engage in dialogue.”


Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, said, “The Biden administration wants to make it clear, for the record and as we approach the November presidential election, that the administration was proactive in its policy toward North Korea and they did everything possible” to have Pyongyang “return to negotiations.”

## US tax service to audit wealthy more, fix disparity on lower-income Blacks

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON  — The Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. tax agency, said Thursday that it has taken steps to address a wide disparity in audit rates between Black taxpayers and other filers. And it said it is more closely examining the returns of larger numbers of wealthy people and major companies.


"We are overhauling compliance efforts to advance our commitment to fair, equitable, and effective tax administration and hold ourselves accountable to taxpayers we serve," according to an annual update from the agency.


A study from January 2023 involving university researchers and the Treasury Department found that IRS data-driven algorithms selected Black taxpayers for auditing at up to 4.7 times the rate of non-Black taxpayers. The study said the IRS disproportionately audited people who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is aimed at low- to moderate-income workers and families: While Black taxpayers accounted for 21% of the claims for that tax break, they were the focus of 43% of the audits concerning the credit.


"We have taken swift initial action to dramatically reduce the number of those audits. We have also made changes to the selection criteria for those audits," IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said.


Werfel, who was sworn in a little more than a year ago, has testified before Congress about the issue and last September he wrote to the Senate Finance Committee that the IRS would make changes.


The discriminatory audits, he told reporters, "degrade trust in our tax system."


Werfel and the IRS have tried over the past year to show how money from the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's big climate, health and tax law, has helped to modernize the agency and improve taxpayer services.


He also said that people making less than $400,000 per year would not be subject to more audits because of the new funding.


Noting the promise to keep audit rates for people making $400,000 per year and less at 2018 levels, he said on Thursday that "we haven't in any way exceeded that rate."


He added: "There is no new wave of audits coming for middle and low income" taxpayers — "that is not in our plans in any way, shape or form."


The IRS is focusing the next year on using the funding boost to conduct higher rates of audits on suspected wealthy tax cheats after having collected hundreds of millions of back taxes this year.


Ensuring that people pay their taxes is one of the tax collection agency's biggest challenges. The audit rate of millionaires fell by more than 70% from 2010 to 2019 and the rate on large corporations dropped by more than 50%.


The IRS plans to raise audit rates on companies with assets of more than $250 million to 22.6% in 2026, from an 8.8% rate in the tax year 2019. It also plans to increase audit rates by tenfold on large complex partnerships with assets of more than $10 million.


"While the IRS has accomplished a lot so far with IRA funding," he said, "we need to do much more to make improvements and transform the IRS for the benefit of taxpayers."

## Arizona's governor signs bill to repeal 1864 abortion law

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

phoenix — Democratic Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has relegated a Civil War-era ban on most abortions to the past by signing a bill Thursday to repeal it. 


Hobbs said the move was just the beginning of a fight to protect reproductive health care in Arizona. The repeal of the 1864 law that the state Supreme Court recently reinstated won't take effect until 90 days after the legislative session ends, which typically happens in June or July. 


Abortion rights advocates say they're hopeful a court will step in to prevent what could be a confusing landscape of access for girls and women across Arizona as laws are introduced and then reversed. 


The effort to repeal the long-dormant law, which bans all abortions except those done to save a patient's life, won final legislative approval Wednesday in a 16-14 vote of the Senate, as two GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats. 


Hobbs denounced "a ban that was passed by 27 men before Arizona was even a state, at a time when America was at war over the right to own slaves, a time before women could even vote." 


"This ban needs to be repealed, I said it in 2022 when Roe was overturned, and I said it again and again as governor," Hobbs said during the bill signing. 


In early April, Arizona's Supreme Court voted to restore the 1864 law that provides no exceptions for rape or incest and allows abortions only if the mother's life is in jeopardy. The majority opinion suggested doctors could be prosecuted and sentenced to up to five years in prison if convicted. 


Democrats, who are the minority in the Legislature, struck back with the help of a handful of Republicans in the House and Senate to advance a repeal in a matter of weeks to Hobbs' desk. 


A crowd of lawmakers — mostly women — joined in the signing ceremony with celebratory airs, including taking selfies and exchanging congratulations among Democrats. 


The scene stood in sharp contrast to Wednesday's vote in the Senate that extended for hours as Republicans described their motivations in personal, emotional and even biblical terms — including graphic descriptions of abortion procedures and amplified audio recordings of a fetal heartbeat. 


Meanwhile, across the country, an abortion rights initiative in South Dakota submitted far more signatures than required to make the ballot this fall. In Florida, a ban took effect against most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many people even know they are pregnant. 


In Arizona, once the repeal takes effect in the fall, a 2002 statute banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy will become the state's prevailing abortion law. 


Whether the 1864 law will be enforced in the coming months depends on who is asked. The anti-abortion-rights group defending the ban, Alliance Defending Freedom, maintains county prosecutors can begin enforcing it once the Supreme Court's decision becomes final, which hasn't yet occurred. 


Planned Parenthood Arizona filed a motion Wednesday asking the court to prevent a pause in abortion services until the repeal takes effect. Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes has joined in that action. 


The Supreme Court set deadlines next week for briefings on the motion.

## Lateral Thinking

date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog

For me, lateral thinking is:
Solving problems using an indirect and creative approach. Using reasoning that is not immediately obvious and involving ideas that might not be obtainable by using traditional step-by-step logic.
One &ldquo;simple&rdquo; approach to &ldquo;think outside the box&rdquo; is:
Understanding WHAT you want to achieve. Understanding WHY you want to achieve it. Knowing the rules of the game constraints like environment, budget, physical limitations, etc. Reframing WHAT you want in a way that ignores these rules of the game.

## Simplicity vs familiarity

date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog

I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about how we interact with technology, and I&rsquo;ve come to realize that being familiar with something doesn&rsquo;t always mean it&rsquo;s simple. In fact, it can sometimes make things more complicated.
For example, when I&rsquo;m working on code or documentation, I find myself getting too close to the issue. It&rsquo;s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture and get caught up in the details. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important for us to take a step back, look at our work from a different perspective, and ask for feedback.

## Judge declares mistrial in lawsuit filed by former Abu Ghraib prisoners

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — A judge declared a mistrial Thursday after a jury said it was deadlocked in the trial of a military contractor accused of contributing to the abuse of detainees at the Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq two decades ago. 


The mistrial came in the jury's eighth day of deliberations. The deliberations went far longer than the trial itself. 


The eight-member civil jury in Alexandria deadlocked on accusations the civilian interrogators who were supplied to the U.S. Army at Abu Ghraib in 2003 and 2004 had conspired with soldiers there to abuse detainees as a means of "softening them up" for questioning. 


The trial was the first time a U.S. jury heard claims brought by Abu Ghraib survivors in the 20 years since photos of detainee mistreatment — accompanied by smiling U.S. soldiers inflicting the abuse — shocked the world during the U.S. occupation of Iraq. 




Reston, Virginia-based CACI had argued that it wasn't complicit in the detainees' abuse. It said that its employees had minimal interaction with the three plaintiffs in the case and that any liability for their mistreatment belonged to the government, not CACI. 


Multiple jurors told The Associated Press that most of the jury sided with the plaintiffs, but they declined to give an exact numerical breakdown among the eight-member panel. 


CACI, as one of its defenses, has argued it shouldn't be liable for any misdeeds by its employees if they were under the control and direction of the Army. 


The plaintiffs' lawyers tried to bar CACI from making that argument at trial, but the jury was allowed to consider it. 


Both sides argued about the scope of the doctrine. Fundamentally, though, if CACI could prove its interrogators were under the command and control of the Army at the time any misconduct occurred, then the jury was instructed to find in favor of CACI. 


The issue of who controlled CACI interrogators occupied a significant portion of the trial. CACI officials testified that they basically turned over supervision of the interrogators to the Army. 


Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued otherwise, and introduced evidence including CACI's contract with the Army, which required CACI to supervise its own employees. Jurors also saw a section of the Army Field Manual that pertains to contractors and states that "only contractors may supervise and give direction to their employees." 


In their note explaining their deadlock, the jury said the Field Manual was one of the pieces of evidence over which they disagreed. 


The jurors who spoke to AP said there was conflicting evidence in the case about whether CACI retained control of its employees while they were in Abu Ghraib. 


The plaintiffs can seek a retrial. 


Asked if they would do so, one of their lawyers, Baher Azmy with the Center for Constitutional Rights, said that "the current expectation is that we'll continue to fight." 


The lawsuit was first filed in 2008 and was delayed by 15 years of legal wrangling and multiple attempts by CACI to have the case dismissed. 


CACI's lawyers declined to comment as they left court. A company spokesperson did not respond to an email seeking comment. 


While it took a monumental effort on the plaintiffs' part to get the case to trial, it's possible that a retrial might be easier to conduct than normal. Many of the witnesses testified through recorded depositions that could simply be replayed. The three plaintiffs, though, provided live testimony — one in person and the other two through video hookups from Iraq.

## US journalist held in Russian prison for 400 days

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

united nations — Four hundred days.


That's how long American journalist Evan Gershkovich has been held in a Russian prison.


Russia's Federal Security Service detained him while he was on assignment for U.S. newspaper The Wall Street Journal in the city of Yekaterinburg and accused him of espionage.


The newspaper and the U.S. government have denied the charges against the now 32-year-old reporter.


U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Thursday at a U.S.-hosted event on the eve of World Press Freedom Day that reporters are too often wrongfully detained for "simply telling the truth."


"That was Evan's crime. Reporting the facts about Russia's illegal war in Ukraine," she said.


Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in March 2022. Gershkovich was arrested a day after publishing a report on how the war had hurt Russia's economy.


Thomas-Greenfield said the Biden administration will not rest until Gershkovich is reunited with his family. His parents and sister were present at the event.


Mariana Katzarova, U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Russian Federation, told the gathering by video from Bulgaria that she is very concerned that Gershkovich has been held for over a year without a trial or evidence.


"The arrest and detention of Evan raises serious concerns about his personal safety, as well as the safety of all foreign journalists conducting their legitimate business in Russia," she said.


In October 2023, dual U.S.-Russian national Alsu Kurmasheva, 47, who works for VOA's sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, was also arrested in Russia. She remains jailed on charges of failing to self-register as a so-called foreign agent and spreading what Moscow views as false information about the Russian military. If convicted, she could face up to 15 years in prison.


Kurmasheva was in Russia to visit her elderly and ailing mother.


Katzarova said Russia has one of the highest conviction rates in the world.


"Once charged, the likelihood of being found guilty in the Russian court is very high," she said, "raising concerns about the fairness and independence of the judiciary in Russia and about the rights of the accused to a fair trial."


David Rohde, an American journalist who was kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2008 but escaped after seven months in captivity, told the gathering that the source of attacks on journalists has shifted in the past several years.


"There has been a dramatic change where the people detaining and in some places killing journalists has shifted from extremist groups and criminal groups to a large number of states," he said.


"It has been more than a year now, and every day is a day too long," Danielle Gershkovich said of her brother's detention.


"We need to do whatever it takes to bring him home now."

## US defense secretary meeting with Pacific allies in Hawaii

date: 2024-05-03, from: VOA News USA

pentagon — U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was in Hawaii on Thursday to meet with leaders from Australia, Japan and the Philippines amid increasing concerns about Chinese military aggression in the Pacific.


Defense officials said the talks would continue the allies’ “historic progress” on cooperation in their defense industries and military activities, including air and missile defense.


Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called the quadrilateral group an “anti-aggression coalition” whose efforts protect “many countries around the world who depend on the ability for commercial vessels to sail freely and unimpeded through the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.”


“The single biggest reason for what we're witnessing in Hawaii this week is the increasingly aggressive behavior of the People's Republic of China,” Bowman told VOA.


 “I think Japan, Australia and the Philippines understand that investments in deterrence are far less costly than dealing with a war that could have been prevented, and they understand that deterrence will be much stronger and more effective if they work with the United States and they work with each other,” he said.


Austin was to meet with Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense Richard Marles on Thursday following Australia’s commitment last month to increase defense spending by 20% over the next decade.


Austin also planned to meet with Japanese Minister of Defense Minoru Kihara. During an April state visit in Washington, U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced deepening military cooperation, including creation of a trilateral air defense architecture with Australia and trilateral exercises with the United Kingdom.


Trilateral session


The U.S., Japan and Australia were to convene a trilateral meeting following the bilateral talks, where a senior defense official said they were expected to sign a new trilateral agreement on strategic research and development.


Austin then planned to host a quadrilateral meeting with Filipino Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro and their Japanese and Australian counterparts.  It will be the second such meeting of the four countries' defense ministers.


A senior defense official, speaking to reporters ahead of the meeting, said talks would  focus on deterring actors from activities that could “undermine peace and stability in the region, whether it's in East Asia, the East China Sea, South China Sea or the Pacific Islands.”


Tensions have risen between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea, with China’s coast guard using water cannons last month to threaten Filipino fishing ships. China has also used collision and ramming tactics, undersea barriers and a military-grade laser to stop Philippine resupply and patrol missions.


Bowman said he expected Beijing to complain about the talks as an attempt to form a coalition like NATO in the Pacific.


“I think as a general rule, the People's Republic of China wants to deal with everything in the region in a bilateral way that allows Beijing to take advantage of power asymmetries. … The bully on the playground ... doesn't want to deal with four or five kids at the same time,” he said.


Last month, Austin spoke with Chinese Admiral Dong Jun in the first dialogue between the two countries’ defense chiefs in nearly 17 months.


The Pentagon said Austin and his Chinese counterpart discussed “defense relations” and global security issues ranging from Russia’s unprovoked war in Ukraine to recent provocations from North Korea. A Pentagon press release said Austin stressed the importance of “respect for high seas freedom of navigation as guaranteed under international law, especially in the South China Sea.” 


Beijing has asserted its desire to control access to the South China Sea and bring Taiwan under its control, by force if necessary.


Biden has said U.S. troops will defend the democratically run island from attack.

## Microservices vs monoliths

date: 2024-05-03, from: Memo Garcia blog

Which architecture should I choose?
I don&rsquo;t think this is the right question to ask. A better question would be, given the current state of my service/product, which architecture will provide what I&rsquo;m looking for? For example, performance, independent deployments, application boundaries, etc.
For example, many people mention that we should start with a monolith and while I agree with some of the arguments (simplified development and deployment, consistent performance), it tends to ignore the fact that it might be better to prioritize freedom and experimentation at early stages rather than performance.

## My issue with Github Actions

date: 2024-05-02, from: Memo Garcia blog

GitHub actions are a problem because they lock you by the balls and you cannot reproduce your pipelines.
Getting to depend on all those small Actions saves 5 minutes today, only to make migrations immensely painful tomorrow.
Build, package, and release software should be written as standalone scripts that in principle could even run in the developer&rsquo;s machine. Moving them to CI is just changing the machine that will run the scripts.

## RISC OS Open 5.30 arrives with Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi support

date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News

This is, in a way, a mature OS with an ecosystem and an aftermarket. (Which, we feel we must explicitly spell out, means that quite a few of those third-party applications and drivers will cost you money.) There are emulators that will let you run 20th century Acorn apps that you can find online, but this isn&#8217;t an emulated vintage environment like Amiga Forever. It&#8217;s not meant for running games from thirty years ago. This is a native bare-metal OS, built on 1980s roots but updated for 21st century hardware. It&#8217;s also not an experimental project with little practical use, like Redox OS or Serenity OS, interesting though those are. ↫ Liam Proven at The Register I grew up with RISC OS and still run a RISC OS machine to this day. As Liam Proven explains affectionately in this article, while as an operating system it&#8217;s missing many features we now take for granted (memory protection, pre-emptive multitasking, compositing), some of the user interface ideas it implements still manage to feel advanced compared to modern-day desktops (no need for menu bars, no clunky file dialogues, elegant mouse button assignments). The fact it&#8217;s found a home on the Raspberry Pi and continues to support an active community is testament to its enduring appeal and the amazing work of the RISC OS Open project. Some additional notes from Thom: this new release supports 7 ARM platforms, most notably the Raspberry Pi Zero, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (but not the 5), and it even supports WiFi on the 3 and 4, which is an absolutely incredible achievement. The number of fixed bugs and addressed issues is massive, and there&#8217;s even more to come later during the year, as The Register&#8217;s article notes. I was waiting on this release to spur me on to buy a new Raspberry Pi (my only other Pi is our Pi-Hole), so I&#8217;ll definitely be on the lookout for a good deal. This release deserves my full attention for OSNews.

## The BASIC programming language turns 60

date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News

Sixty years ago, on May 1, 1964, at 4 am in the morning, a quiet revolution in computing began at Dartmouth College. That&#8217;s when mathematicians John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the first program written in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner&#8217;s All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the college&#8217;s General Electric GE-225 mainframe. Little did they know that their creation would go on to democratize computing and inspire generations of programmers over the next six decades. ↫ Benj Edwards at Ars Technica Even I have used BASIC in the past, when I was a child and discovered QBasic (or possibly GW-BASIC, I&#8217;m a bit hazy on the details) and started messing around with it. My experiences with BASIC didn&#8217;t lead to a path of ever more complex programming languages, but for huge numbers of people, it did &#8211; it&#8217;s wild just how many people over a certain age got their programming start with BASIC in the 8 bit home computer era. I mean, 30 GOTO 10 is such a widespread morsel of knowledge it made its way into all kinds of popular media, such as a few Easter egg jokes in Futurama. BASIC has effectively achieved immortality.

## Inside the Snapdragon 855’s iGPU

date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News

Qualcomm’s Adreno 6xx architecture has been superseded Adreno 7xx, but it’s still used in countless devices, including the current-gen Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3. Here, I’ll be looking at the Adreno 640 GPU in the Snapdragon 855. Zarif98 on Reddit kindly provided a OnePlus 7 Pro, and I’ll be using that to check out Adreno 640. Compared to the older Snapdragon 821’s Adreno 530, Adreno 640 dramatically increases compute throughput while still working within a very constrained power and thermal envelope. Process node improvements help, and TSMC’s 7 nm process should be far better than the 14 nm Samsung node used in the Snapdragon 821. But cell phone SoC constraints meant Qualcomm couldn’t go around copy-pasting basic GPU building blocks and call it a day. ↫ Chips and Cheese Chips and Cheese with another deep dive.

## At Microsoft, years of security debt come crashing down

date: 2024-05-02, from: OS News

Years of accumulated security debt at Microsoft are seemingly crashing down upon the company in a manner that many critics warned about, but few ever believed would actually come to light.&#160; Microsoft is an entrenched enterprise provider, owning nearly one-quarter of the global cloud infrastructure services market and, as of Q1 last year, nearly 20% of the worldwide SaaS application market, according to Synergy Research Group. Though not immune to scandal, in the wake of two major nation-state breaches of its core enterprise platforms, Microsoft is facing one of its most serious reputational crises. ↫ David Jones at Cybersecurity Dive It&#8217;s almost like having the entire US government dependent on a single vendor is a bad idea. Just spitballing here.

date: 2024-05-02, updated: 2024-05-02, from: RAND blog

After two years of the Russia-Ukraine war with still no end in sight, NATO members have begun asking what it will take to turn the tide in Ukraine's favor. To fully expel Russian forces in the next two years, U.S. support and broad NATO investments will be required.

## NYPD Produces Propaganda Instead of Legally Required Public Records

NYPD was able to spin out a hype video in less than 24 hours, which is notable because New York City has been horrendously slow to producing public records they are obligated by law to provide to the taxpayers who fund them.

## 3 Ways to Make Sense of Elon Musk’s Supercharger Massacre

date: 2024-05-02, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjE2MzQzOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3NDc5MTE1N30.TWRTk4XNOenD5v9O3IFR2p4VTNcat8TEj9hJGci48eo/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">“Delete, delete, delete,” Elon Musk reportedly told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, describing his approach to management. “Delete any part or process you can. You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10% of them, then you didn't delete enough.”</p>
<p>Musk has taken his own advice: He is slicing to the bone. Earlier this week, he dismissed the head of Tesla’s Supercharger network, Rebecca Tinucci, as well as her more than 500-person team. As of today, Tesla has only a barebones crew, at best, tasked with maintaining and expanding its high-speed car charging network. It has already <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/30/tesla-pulling-back-supercharger-plans-firing-team/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pulled out</u></a> of a planned expansion in New York City.</p>
<p>Musk also laid off what remained of the company’s policy and new vehicle teams. These severe cuts follow layoffs announced in March, when Musk dismissed about 10% of Tesla’s employees. According to <em><em>Electrek, </em></em>the two events <a href="https://electrek.co/2024/05/01/elon-musk-throwing-weight-tesla-wrecking-ball/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>may be related</u></a>: Musk asked Tinucci to make deeper cuts in her team in April, she pushed back, and he fired her to set an example. The company has cut more than 14,000 employees worldwide since the beginning of the year. </p>
<p>The news is — and there is no way of sugarcoating this — either sort of stupid, bad, or very bad for the electric vehicle transition. Here are three ways of looking at it: </p>
<h3>1. It’s worrisome for other automakers</h3><p>Over the past year, every other major automaker in the United States has switched to Tesla’s charging plug, the North American Charging Standard, or NACS. They have struck deals that will let them use much of Tesla’s existing Supercharger network; Ford is in the process of mailing its drivers a free NACs adapter plug. These agreements were meant to give consumers more certainty about the EV transition: No matter what car they bought, they would be able to use most of Tesla’s superior charging network. </p>
<p>Now, that certainty is gone. Which chargers will work in the future? How much more will the Tesla network expand? And what will happen to those deals with automakers now that the Supercharger team is gone? The employees laid off this week included those who worked closely with other companies. </p>
<p>At least publicly, Ford is keeping its cool. “Our plans for our customers do not change,” Marty Günsberg, communications director for Ford’s electric vehicle division, told Heatmap. And yet contractors and others with business in front of Tesla's charging team were left completely in the dark Tuesday, their emails bouncing back from addresses that no longer existed, according to <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/tesla-layoffs-shake-confidence-in-the-ev-charging-future/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em>E&E News</em></u></a>. No other equivalent charging network exists in the U.S., meaning there's no other easy place for them to go.</p>
<h3>2. It’s about hype</h3><p>Musk, for his part, has intimated that the company will begin to look into wireless charging. Although wireless charging may make slightly more sense for self-driving cars — the car could drive itself into a given spot, <em><em>et</em></em> <em><em>voilà!</em></em> — it is a puzzling decision from a man who has said the only real constraints are those imposed by the laws of physics. More than half of current and prospective EV owners <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/features/mckinsey-center-for-future-mobility/our-insights/exploring-consumer-sentiment-on-electric-vehicle-charging" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>say that they worry</u></a> about charger availability and convenience, yet wireless charging <a href="https://www.anker.com/blogs/chargers/wireless-charging-vs-wired" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>is slower and less efficient</u></a> than wired charging, meaning it will require <em><em>more </em></em>charging spots and each vehicle will have to stay there longer. </p>
<p>So again we must ask, why? The answer may lie in the animal spirits of the market — and Elon’s dependence on the market for his personal wealth. Tesla’s stock has more or less held steady since the cuts. As my colleague Matthew Zeitlin <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-supercharger-layoffs" target="_self"><u>wrote</u></a>, Musk has spun the layoffs as part of a corporate turn away from selling electric vehicles, chargers, and home batteries and toward achieving artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. </p>
<p>That is partly because Musk must keep justifying — or, if we really want to be blunt, <em><em>propping up </em></em>— Tesla’s astronomical share price, which itself is premised on the idea that Tesla is a technology company, not a car company. In order to do that, he must continually steer his sometimes-profitable company toward the buzziest, most hyped-up phenomenon in the economy. Never mind his <em><em>actually existing EV charger business</em></em>; that can’t justify the fantasy of the share price. He needs to find something new.</p>
<h3>3. It’s a bad sign</h3><p>One of the more useful ways of understanding Elon Musk is that he seeks to create and control private infrastructure. SpaceX creates privatized access to rocket launches. Starlink allows for privatized access to the global, satellite-provided internet. The Hyperloop — to the degree that it <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/hyperloop" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>existed at all</u></a> — sought to create a privatized and individualized form of mass transit. (Musk, fittingly, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-awkward-dislike-mass-transit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hates</u></a> public transit.) Even Musk’s purchase of Twitter, now rechristened X, reflected a desire to enclose the public sphere. </p>
<p>And for the past year, you could understand Tesla in the same light. Sure, Tesla was an electric vehicle company. But it was rapidly becoming an infrastructure company. Through its deals with other automakers, it was cementing itself as the premier provider of electric vehicle charging in the United States. It was also the part of the company that elicited the least suspicion from Tesla’s many critics. Drivers might not always be able to rely on a third-party charger, but a Tesla Supercharger? It worked. </p>
<p>It hasn’t always been this way. For years, the Supercharger network seemed like Tesla’s key competitive advantage, its <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Warren Buffett-style moat</u></a>. If you wanted access to America’s most famous and reliable fast-charging network, you had to buy a Tesla. But starting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/30/24145621/tesla-layoff-supercharger-ev-charging-nacs-elon-musk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>with Ford</u></a> a year ago, Musk struck deals with other automakers allowing their cars to use some of its charger network. At the same time, Tesla also <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/02/15/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-standards-and-major-progress-for-a-made-in-america-national-network-of-electric-vehicle-chargers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bowed</u></a> to federal pressure and <a href="https://www.sae.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>standardized</u></a> its NACS charger with SAE International. That helped it <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/27/tesla-biden-electric-car-charging-00143431" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>win more than $17 million in grants</u></a> from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build even more chargers. </p>
<p>Why pull back now? None of the options is very encouraging. The most hopeful answer is Tesla-specific: Maybe demand for the automaker’s vehicles is sinking so quickly that Musk is, in essence, reaching for things he can throw overboard. Tesla has historically relied on Chinese consumers to buoy its sales, but it has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/tesla-also-losing-ground-in-china-as-it-disappoints-globally" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>hemorrhaged market share</u></a> in China as <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/ford-gm-stellantis-byd" target="_self"><u>the country’s home-grown automakers</u></a> have come out with newer and often superior EVs. But things there took a turn for the better earlier this week as Musk won <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/boss-battery-giant-catl-visits-elon-musks-hotel-beijing-reuters-witness-2024-04-29/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>approval (albeit conditional)</u></a> to use Tesla’s so-called Full Self-Driving software on Chinese roads. And even if a sales slump were the explanation, why also ditch the team working on new vehicles at Tesla? </p>
<p>The other possibilities are bleaker. BloombergNEF <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-04-09/tesla-tsla-charging-network-has-become-a-serious-business" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has ballparked</u></a> that Tesla’s charging business could generate $740 million in annual profits by 2030. But that relies on Musk’s estimate that the Supercharging business has a 10% margin. If that margin has since shrunk — or if its chargers just aren’t getting used as much as Tesla once anticipated — then further investment right now might not make sense. </p>
<p>That’s a problem, though, as most prospective buyers say that there need to be even <em><em>more </em></em>public chargers before they would consider buying an EV. If the economics don’t justify a further investment in chargers, however, even with all that apparently pent up demand, then the country is in a pickle. In that case, Musk’s decision looks self-defeating, a panicky and downturn-averse reaction that will ultimately undercut the market for Tesla’s cars. </p>
<p>About the only bright spot here is that Musk has surrendered hundreds of the most talented charging employees to the market. Tesla excelled at using a mix of policy and engineering prowess to integrate their chargers into local utilities’ systems and rate structures; other automakers can now snap up the people with those skills.</p>

## Gogoro Pulse first ride: Testing the most high-tech performance electric scooter

Best known for its battery-swapping system and cute, brightly-colored scooters, the Pulse launched an edgy new look for Gogoro. But even more importantly, it also showed off an entire suite of new high-tech innovations.</p>



<p>And so when I received an invite to be the first Westerner to test ride the Pulse and share the experience with the world, I jumped on it. Every company seems to proclaim that their new e-scooter is like none other before, but only the Gogoro Pulse is one of the few that can truly mean it. This electric scooter marks a paradigm shift in what is possible for this form factor and with Gogoro’s swappable battery standard.</p>

The hearing followed the release of damning internal documents suggesting executives from major fossil fuel producers sought to “deceive the public about the enormous climate crisis we are in and the role that Big Oil has played in bringing it about,” said Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight committee.</p><p><a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VXblWg2wvrRCW98x4_D3l6Gt0VNrtzX5dBZs8N8_nRGx3qn9gW7Y8-PT6lZ3pJVwwSbD3pG0-LW6bt-K31Vw9p8W4nZBBn1p4TdlW4204vm3w_-hJV2BJlY1MybKhW90Y00X3TJb3BW3prGvb3HytyZW5jzqdQ1kjtPFW6w_VnL45g2HCW5qYN9j4qcGdJV91VPf2Lsz_0W3w8MJS4kmpnMVv7x1y371SL_W9cCn2r2QdpjvW5wfyFP4bR7W_W24G97f2GLPKgW4bnGmc46K8ZlW1FL6wy4W8GHdVVKCzv2dJXcvW7HbhK81jr0rZVshv87261TrkW2pq5M43lqfCwW21c3Jp5ZPHmnW7VzTBQ4fKtHzW5nND-h8tG_J1W6kHDKS5ZF_TYf1wKWds04" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heatmap’s Jillian Goodman was watching</a> the hearing and found the most interesting part to be when Sharon Eubanks, who led the Department of Justice case against Big Tobacco, called for an end to the hand-wringing about what should be done, and suggested the DOJ swiftly launch an investigation into the petroleum industry, the outcome of which could force it to change the way it does business. And that, Eubanks said, is the point of all this — not extracting money, although that’s nice too, but rather to force companies to operate in a more open and honest fashion. “I myself am not a lawyer, of course, but it might be time to listen to Eubanks,” Goodman wrote. “She seems to know what she’s talking about.”</p><h3>2.

Between 2017 and 2020, about 40% of the power outages that plagued the state were the result of extreme weather events – mainly flooding and intense precipitation. Many of the areas most exposed to outages have overlapping vulnerabilities, like low-quality housing or lack of green space. “Eastern Queens, upper Manhattan and the Bronx of NYC, the Hudson Valley, and Adirondack regions were more burdened with severe weather-driven outages,” the study found. In Queens, neighborhoods such as Jamaica, Flushing, and Richmond Hills experienced more than 100 outages over three years. “We’re focusing on New York state, but power outages are a growing problem nationally,” Columbia University’s Nina Flores, lead author on the study, <a href="https://d2qwfv04.na1.hubspotlinks.com/Ctc/X+113/d2QWfV04/VXblWg2wvrRCW98x4_D3l6Gt0VNrtzX5dBZs8N8_nRFl5nXHsW5BWr2F6lZ3nRW4rhYtY32DjGqW3PxyS65_gkRjW8TjJ8Q6_h1rGW2JJNrR5s8x4bW8C2pRF6P8tbJN3pFnKxmzk4QW9ljC6M1VTZVSW404T6378w0gBF5qWm-v483YW7m62nw807bs0W5_1-_Z8ymq5WW63MfMp3gttvjW62HL6n7135XrTmJHW1RQnfbW8_bFZH9l1DQfW1DfxZs1QwCtrVyx4yn26sJQvW1Fj-pf1BwJQQW5_cLNH7mtZhSW6clXSZ37NDvvW1ps-BC6fmFCMW3_tjh67H9TrZW25nxnV8tm8CKW27jRyV2RyzJLW4Vc9QP4vhBQ9W1L3MGl3vG5g4W76F3-J7bf_DrVBpMLY37kBqmW5FL9LD1VVHdGVDG_lY581bS2W1XQbKV3-qh_kN8XKDP_kl7D7W2gTrgg1qQ6vbW4fv-wV1BVGMff7QSvyY04" target="_blank">told</a> <em><em>Bloomberg</em></em>.

But “it also means [flaring is] not visible from space by most of the methods used to track flare volumes,” said Eric Kort, a climate and space sciences professor at the University of Michigan.</p><h3>5.

Whooping seems to be back. Shouting &#8216;whoo!&#8217; as a way of expressing your enthusiasm. Either that, or it never went away and I have grown inured to it. Explain it how you will, but after five whooping experiences in the last three weeks - one at a concert, one at a play, two at anniversary parties and one at Passover - I can now say definitively that I&#8217;m hearing it again.

## IndieWeb Carnival: Natural creativity

date: 2024-05-02, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>I spend the vast majority of my time doing creative work. I code for a living, sometimes I design for a living. I code as a hobby, sometimes I do design as a hobby. I also write. Being creative ain’t easy. At least not for me. I sit at my desk, staring at the same screen day after day and sometimes it’s hard to find inspiration. But every time I find myself stuck I can get unstuck with one simple trick: I leave.</p>
<p>My creative environment is when I’m outside, not trying to do anything creative. And this is especially true when I’m walking in nature. I’m not the first one to realise that there’s a connection between walking in nature and creativity. There’s something about moving through space that makes my brain work differently.</p>
<p>Nature is, more often than not, my creative environment. Back in 2019, I started a very random project called <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/writing-hiking-and-sharing">From the Summit</a>. It was an attempt to capture this exact phenomenon, the bursts of creativity born from moving through space. It’s easily my favourite digital experiment.</p>
<p>At the end of the day though, the only environment that matters, when it comes to creativity, is the mental space I’m in. That’s why I find nature so useful. The cadence of the walk, the sounds, the light, the smell. All the senses are engaged when I’m outside in nature and as a result, my brain becomes more creative.</p>
<p>The next time you’re creatively stuck, if you can, go for a walk in nature. You won’t regret it.</p>

<p>This post was part of May's <a href="https://indieweb.org/indieweb-carnival">IndieWeb Carnival</a> on the topic of <a href="https://hamatti.org/posts/indie-web-carnival-may-2024-creative-environments/"><em>Creative environments</em></a>.

Today, Florida&#8217;s ban on abortions after six weeks&#8212;earlier than most women know they&#8217;re pregnant&#8212;went into effect. The Florida legislature passed the law and Florida governor Ron DeSantis signed it a little more than a year ago, on April 13, 2023, but the new law was on hold while the Florida Supreme Court reviewed it. On April 1 the court permitted the law to go into operation today.

## pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL Introduces Automatic DDL Replication and Snowflake Sequences for Postgres

date: 2024-05-02, from: PostgreSQL News

<p>New capabilities advance state of the art in Postgres logical replication</p>
<p>Alexandria, VA - April 17, 2024 - pgEdge, Inc., the leading company dedicated to distributed Postgres, today unveiled two major advances in logical replication for the widely adopted open-source PostgreSQL database. These are automatic DDL (Data Definition Language) replication, and snowflake sequences, an innovative solution to the problem of maintaining unique sequence identifiers across a distributed Postgres cluster.  pgEdge Distributed PostgreSQL is the first and only fully distributed PostgreSQL database solution that is open (source available) and completely based on the PostgreSQL database itself.</p>
<p>Automatic Replication of DDL Commands.
DDL is used to create and modify Postgres objects like tables, indexes, views and constraints through command statements like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.  DML (data manipulation language) is used to perform operations on the data within those database objects through command statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.  </p>
<p>Traditionally, logical replication in Postgres only allowed for the replication of DML statements and not DDL.  Manual efforts were required on each node to modify table definitions through DDL commands that had to be executed on every node. </p>
<p>With the introduction of automatic DDL replication on pgEdge, developers can now update the database schema on a single node and have it automatically propagated to other nodes in the cluster. This feature makes it far easier to support distributed Postgres applications where the database schema is frequently updated because of active development or maintenance. </p>
<p>Snowflake Sequence in Postgres Extension:
Managing sequences in a distributed PostgreSQL environment can be complex, especially in multi-master replication scenarios.  A Postgres sequence provides a unique integer number to use as an ID for the database table and its records. If you insert new records it will assign the next number in the sequence without issue.  </p>
<p>In a distributed application, however, the sequence must be updated across different regions and if each node updates the sequence independently you will have conflicts that cannot be resolved.  For example, if a sequence is being used as a primary key, the next value of the sequence on a node in the US could be selected at the exact same time the next value of the sequence is selected on a node in Australia, resulting in a primary key conflict.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, pgEdge has integrated snowflake sequences into a Postgres extension. A snowflake sequence allows for the utilization of a guaranteed unique sequence within a cluster without the need for application code or schema modifications. By automatically installing the Snowflake extension in pgEdge Platform and pgEdge Cloud databases, users can easily maintain unique sequence numbers across different regions, eliminating conflicts and enhancing scalability. </p>
<p>An exclusive presentation and paper on the Snowflake extension will be showcased at the Silicon Valley Postgres conference in San Jose this week.</p>
<p>“By offering these cutting-edge capabilities built on open, standard-based Postgres, we demonstrate our ongoing commitment to making advanced distributed Postgres capabilities available to the Postgres community. Our goal is to make it easier and faster to deliver distributed Postgres applications that are always on, always available and always responsive,” remarked Phillip Merrick, Co-founder and CEO of pgEdge.</p>
<p>Availability
Automatic DDL Replication and Snowflake Sequences are available now within both pgEdge Platform (self hosted) or pgEdge Cloud (fully managed cloud service).</p>
