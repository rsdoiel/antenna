<p>
How to add a <a href="https://blogroll.social/">FeedLand blogroll</a> to
a <a href="http://docserver.scripting.com/drummer/blogging.opml">Drummer
blog</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You must have a Drummer blog and a FeedLand account.
</li>
<li>
You can specify that all the feeds you’re subscribed to are in your
blogroll or use a category and only feeds in that category will be in
the blogroll.
</li>
<li>
The blogroll updates automatically, when one of the feeds has a new
post, it goes to the top of the list.
</li>
<li>
You can expand a feed to see the five most recent items. Click on the
pubdate to go to the full item on the web.
</li>
<li>
It supports keyboard navigation. Up and down arrows move through the
list, Return to expand/collapse.
</li>
<li>
We’re working on WordPress plugin.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Four head-level attributes in your blog.opml file. Only one required.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
blogrollUsername – required
</li>
<li>
blogrollServer – optional, if not specified it’s feedland.com
</li>
<li>
blogrollCategory – optional
</li>
<li>
blogrollTitle – optional, but you really should provide a title,
otherwise we invent a silly one for you. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<a href="http://oldschool.scripting.com/bullmancuso@gmail.com/">Bull
Mancuso’s blog</a>.
</p>

<a href="https://imgs.scripting.com/2024/04/15/bullblogscreenshot.png">Screen

</p>
<p>
A link to Bull’s blogroll
<a href="https://feedland.com/?username=bullmancuso&catname=blogroll">category</a>
on feedland.com.
</p>
<p>
A
<a href="https://github.com/scripting/Scripting-News/issues/303">place</a>
to ask questions offer kudos, etc. <span
class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>
</p>
<p>
PS: I’m not trying to sell you on using Drummer to run a blog. Rather I
needed a place to figure out how this works, so we know how to set up
and document the WordPress plugin.

external SSDs are faster with Apple silicon</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: OS News</p>
<p>After several days testing the latest Express 1M2 enclosure from OWC,
I have changed my recommendations for the best external SSDs. Previously
I had chosen the relatively reliable Thunderbolt 3 up to 3 GB/s, even
though few drives ever seemed capable of achieving that up to. If you’re
still needing good performance with an Intel Mac, that makes sense. But
if you need best performance with an Apple silicon Mac, you’re far
better off with a high-quality USB 40Gbps enclosure such as OWC’s
Express 1M2, which should reliably return over 3 GB/s even through a
compatible hub. I much prefer the word over to up to. ↫ Howard Oakley If
you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you’re looking for an external drive
– this is some good advice to follow.</p>

<p>
On today’s program, we’re taking a closer look at immigration and
entrepreneurship. Immigrants are more likely to start a new company than
U.S.-born citizens, studies show. And those new businesses need to make
hires — turns out, immigrant entrepreneurs are associated with a net
gain in jobs. We’ll discuss. Also, a boost in the Internal Revenue
Service budget seems to be making a difference, and investors respond to
rising tensions in the Middle East.

Tesla has reportedly laid off “more than 10%” of its global workforce,

to Jameson Dow</a> at <em><em>Electrek</em></em>. In an internal
company-wide email, CEO Elon Musk said “this will enable us to be lean,
innovative and hungry for the next growth phase cycle.” The exact
headcount isn’t clear but Dow calculates a 10% cut would bring the
number of workers newly out of a job to about 14,000. The news wasn’t
unexpected – employees had been whispering about potential layoffs for a
few weeks, and their angst was fueled by the announcement last Thursday
that Cybertruck production shifts at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Texas would
be shortened, starting today. Dow notes the layoffs will hurt morale,
“which is a shame, because we do need Tesla to keep pushing things
forward, and to keep attracting the best and brightest.”

it nicely: “The nation’s largest property owner, the federal government,
effectively charges rent to oil and gas companies that exploit public
land for private profit.” Now it is hiking its rates. The new rules,
which could take effect in 60 days, raise royalty rates, lease rents,
minimum auction bids, as well as “bonding rates,” which are upfront
payments “to cover the cost of plugging abandoned oil and gas wells,”

The new minimum lease bonds will be $150,000 per lease, up from $10,000.
Royalty rates will rise from 12.5% to 16.67%. The government estimates
the rules would increase costs for fossil fuel companies by about $1.5

Flooding is common for the region in the spring, but this year has been

winter, and higher-than usual snowfall followed by a burst of warm
weather made for ideal flood conditions. Maria Shahgedanova, a professor

Technique</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, updated: 2024-04-14, from: Bruce Schneier blog</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555">new paper</a> presents a
polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving certain hard lattice
problems. This could be a big deal for post-quantum cryptographic
algorithms, since many of them base their security on hard lattice
problems.
</p>
<p>
A few things to note. One, this paper has not yet been peer reviewed. As
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/111385/polynomial-time-quantum-algorithms-for-lattice-problems">this
comment</a> points out: “We had already some cases where efficient
quantum algorithms for lattice problems were discovered, but they turned
out
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41731/new-quantum-attack-on-lattices-or-shor-strikes-again?rq=1">not
being correct</a> or only worked for
<a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/95187/what-does-the-work-an-efficient-quantum-algorithm-for-lattice-problems-achievin">simple
special cases</a>.”
</p>
<p>
Two, this is a quantum algorithm, which means that it has not been
tested. There is a wide gulf between quantum algorithms in theory and in
practice. And until we can actually code and test these algorithms, we
should be suspicious of their speed and complexity claims…

back in 2008,” MTA board member Haeda Mihaltses, a veteran of the
Bloomberg administration, mused just before she cast her vote in favor.
</p>
<p>
The price of nearly two decades of procrastination over doing something
to alleviate the most densely-populated,
<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/13/nyc-drivers-travel-just-12-mph-during-rush-hour/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>traffic-snarled
place</u></a> in North America is, indeed, unfathomably high. There’s
the billions of dollars of mass transit infrastructure we missed out on,
the billions
<a href="https://leading.business.columbia.edu/main-pillar-climate-change-sustainability/economy-policy/congestion-pricing-new-york" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>spent
on health care</u></a> from breathing in dirty air.
</p>
<p>
And then there’s the most precious resource of all. According to
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/12/01/komanoff-imho-tmrb-is-a-ok" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
calculation</u></a> from transport economist and congestion pricing
advocate Charles Komanoff, the plan the MTA adopted last month will save
drivers, bus passengers, and subway riders a combined 225,000 hours
every single day. Here’s a fun thought experiment: If New York had
adopted this plan back in 2008, we could have saved ourselves a combined
1,314,000,000 hours, or 150,000 years.
</p>
<p>
How could implementing something so obviously necessary and routine —
anyone who has paid to camp in a National Park or drive on the New
Jersey Turnpike understands the concept — take so long? What does it say
about how we govern? And what can we learn from it?
</p>
<p>
“I think it is fair to say that whatever roadblock congestion pricing
could have hit, it hit,” Rachael Fauss, a policy director and MTA
researcher for the good government group
<a href="https://reinventalbany.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Reinvent
Albany</u>, told me</a>. “It was the worst case scenario of timelines if
you were to project out: What are the things that could delay this?”
</p>
<p>
Some of the delays were deliberate: It’s hard enough for lawmakers to
summon the courage to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, so
charging drivers money for something that used to be “free,” to fund a
transit agency that often conjures delayed trains and
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-23/in-nyc-subway-a-case-study-in-runaway-transit-construction-costs?embedded-checkout=true" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decades-long
boondoggles</u></a> in the public’s imagination, was always going to
require a fortitude that is in chronically short supply in
Albany.<strong> </strong>When then-New York Governor Andrew Cuomo pushed
to pass congestion pricing in 2019, he and his fellow lawmakers wrote
into the actual bill that the tolling scheme
<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/02/politicians-put-off-setting-congestion-pricing-fee-until-after-2020-election/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>couldn’t
be announced</u></a> for a year and a half — until after the 2020
election. The same politicians who were supposedly brave enough to vote
congestion pricing into law didn’t want anything to do with putting that
law into practice.
</p>
<p>
Then there were the bureaucratic delays. The COVID pandemic, of course,
redirected much of the government and forced the MTA into survival mode
as subway ridership
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/08/climate/nyc-transit-covid.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dropped
90%</u></a>; suddenly the agency’s most important work was to
<a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2020/09/13/railing-over-mta-one-track-mind-on-federal-bailout-hope/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>coordinate</u></a>
lifesaving bailouts from the
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/feds-send-mta-6-billion-keep-secret-sauce-flowing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>federal</u></a>
and
<a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2023/02/01/hochul-proposes-mta-bailout-with-payroll-tax-hike--casino-revenue" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>state
governments</u></a>. Then the Trump administration
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-congestion-pricing-cuomo-trump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>slow-walked</u></a>
the answer to a key question: Because the congestion pricing plan
involved placing tolls on roads built with federal funding, the state
needed a sign-off from the federal Department of Transportation. But was
congestion pricing the kind of massive infrastructure project that,
under the
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/nepa/national-environmental-policy-act-review-process" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>National
Environmental Policy Act</u></a> of 1969, required an exhaustive
Environmental Impact Statement? Could it pass NEPA review with a less
thorough Environmental Assessment? Or, given that nothing was actually
being built up or torn down, could it be exempt from these reviews
altogether?
</p>
<p>
Two years after the congestion pricing law passed, and months after the
plan was supposed to go into effect in early 2021, the newly installed
Biden administration finally
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/03/30/this-is-happening-feds-lets-mta-do-simpler-environmental-review-of-congestion-pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked</u></a>
for the middle option, an Environmental Assessment, which the MTA
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/11/19/congestion-pricing-can-still-happen-in-2021-but-there-are-a-lot-of-ifs-including-president-biden/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>initially
said</u></a> could be done in a matter of months. In actuality, that
timeline stretched to 16 months and produced a
<a href="https://new.mta.info/project/CBDTP/environmental-assessment-2022" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>4,000-page
behemoth</u></a> that some
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2024/03/28/the-toll-of-history-mta-board-approves-15-congestion-pricing-fee" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>experts
noted</u></a> was more comprehensive than the average EIS.
</p>
<p>
Seemingly nothing escaped the MTA’s scrutiny — it even looked at how
congestion pricing would
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2022/06/10/opinion-pete-buttigieg-is-failing-new-york-and-the-country-on-congestion-pricing/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>affect
traffic in the Philadelphia suburbs</u></a> (not all that much). The
results were
<a href="https://www.masstransitmag.com/management/article/21277061/environmental-assessment-for-new-york-mtas-proposed-congestion-pricing-program-released" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>not
exactly shocking</u></a>: Tolling vehicles entering Lower Manhattan
below 60th Street would result in up to 20% fewer vehicles in the
Central Business District, improving air quality while also generating
$1 billion in revenue for public transit, which could then be used to
secure up to $15 billion in bonds. After more than 50 public meetings
and 25,000 written comments
(<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/03/nyregion/nj-congestion-pricing-federal-court.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>60%
in favor</u></a> of the plan), the Biden administration
<a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2023/05/05/federal-government-gives-mta-final-blessing-to-congestion-pricing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>produced</u></a>
a “finding of no significant impact,” meaning that congestion pricing
wouldn’t negatively affect the economy, the environment, or the roads.
</p>
<p>
There was at least one notable benefit that came from doing such a
comprehensive, time-intensive review: The MTA found that congestion
pricing
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/12/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing-manhattan-bronx.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>could
cause an increase</u></a> in truck traffic to the South Bronx for
drivers looking to toll shop, which in turn prompted the agency to
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/28/nyregion/mta-congestion-pricing-pollution-bronx.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>allocate
$200 million to alleviate pollution</u></a> in some of New York City’s
poorest neighborhoods, which have
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/04/new-york-south-bronx-minorities-pollution-inequity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shamefully
high asthma rates</u></a> that
<a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/centers/columbia-center-childrens-environmental-health/our-research/health-effects/asthma" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mostly
affect Black and Latine New Yorkers</u></a>.<strong> </strong>“Is it
congestion pricing’s job to remedy those problems? Maybe not,” Fauss, of
Reinvent Albany, said. “But is it a really important way to correct some
past wrongs? Yeah, absolutely.”
</p>
<p>
The MTA’s thoroughness may help protect it from the
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nj-sues-congestion-pricing-wah-wah" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bad
faith lawsuits</u></a> that have been
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/lawsuit-congestion-pricing-teachers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed</u></a>
to try and shut down the license plate readers before they go live on
June 15. But we’re in the midst of a climate crisis. Why should a
54-year-old law designed to prevent overeager developers from doing
things like demolishing neighborhoods to build highways discourage
cities and states from enacting dynamic, flexible solutions to cut
pollution created by those highways — <em><em>and</em></em> fund public
transit at the same time? And why should a review of a plan that
requires no concrete, no demolition — no actual infrastructure — take
three years?
</p>
<p>
The biggest hurdle congestion pricing had to overcome might have been
psychological. Let’s call it “car brain”: Even though
<a href="https://new.mta.info/document/110766" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>85%</u></a>
of commuters who travel into the Central Business District take mass
transit, for years, lawmakers and congestion pricing opponents have
argued (and in the case of the current New York City Mayor Eric Adams,
<em><em>still</em></em>
<a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/06/metro/eric-adams-adrienne-adams-distance-themselves-from-mtas-15-congestion-toll/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>argue</u></a>)
that charging people to drive into Lower Manhattan was a kind of attack
on the middle class. In a city where valuable street real estate
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nyc-might-charge-for-parking" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
been converted into free parking</u></a>, congestion pricing was
portrayed as profaning the sacred rights of “regular” New Yorkers —
never mind the fact that just
<a href="https://www.cssny.org/news/entry/congestion-pricing-outer-borough-new-yorkers-poverty-data-analysis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2%
of New York’s working poor</u></a> will end up paying the tolls. Driving
your car wherever you please, it turns out, is
<a href="https://blog.tstc.org/2017/04/21/car-free-new-york-city/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>quite
expensive</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Elected officials are facing the world from the front seat of a car,
whether they’re driving or being driven,” Danny Pearlstein, the policy
and communications director at
<a href="https://www.ridersalliance.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Riders
Alliance</u></a>, one of the most forceful proponents of congestion
pricing, told me. Pearlstein added that “bureaucrats who drive to work”
probably contributed to the Biden administration’s slow-walking of the
approval process, or so he suspects. “They were very cautious about
doing something that alters not just, you know, air patterns, or
patterns of inequity, but actual commutes,” Pearlstein said.
</p>
<p>
As a reporter who has covered congestion pricing for nearly a decade, I
have learned never to underestimate the power of “car brain” on public
policy. As a New Yorker who lives steps from the entrance of the
Williamsburg Bridge on the Lower East Side, who watches mothers push
strollers through oceans of hot, heavy steel boxes belching poisonous
gasses driven by people on a hair trigger, and who has seen our leaders
pretend that this is New York, that we are too exceptional to change, I
cannot help but go about my day, doing my best to tune out the incessant
honking, feeling like the dog engulfed in flames:
“<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-is-fine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>This
is fine</u></a>.”
</p>
<p>
That it took transportation advocates, regional planners, and
forward-looking politicians nearly 20 years to enact congestion pricing
in New York City — the U.S. municipality perhaps most amenable to it
because of its housing density and excellent mass transit system —
reveals the daunting task of weaning Americans off the automobile. More
than three-quarters of us
<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/05/commute-america-sustainability-cars/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drive
our own personal cars</u></a> to our jobs.
</p>
<p>
“The only thing that’s going to change the fact that the overwhelming
majority of Americans drive to work is not permitting reforms to
programs like congestion pricing. It’s permitting reforms to allow dense
housing development in metropolitan areas across the country,”
Pearlstein said.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a little bit like a Marxian analysis,” he mused. The crisis must
come to a head in order to overthrow the status quo. “In order to adopt
congestion pricing, you first have to exacerbate congestion
significantly by condensing your built environment.”

Day reveals a major split in how Joe Biden and Donald Trump would
govern</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Tax Day reveals a major split in how Joe Biden and
Donald Trump would govern: The presidential candidates have conflicting
ideas about how much to reveal about their own finances and the best
ways to boost the economy through tax policy.</p>
<p>Biden, the sitting Democratic president, plans to release his income
tax returns on Monday, the IRS filing deadline. And on Tuesday, he is
scheduled to deliver a speech in Scranton, Pennsylvania, about why the
wealthy should pay more in taxes to reduce the federal deficit and help
fund programs for the poor and middle class.</p>
<p>Biden is proud to say that he was largely without money for much of
his decades-long career in public service, unlike Trump, who inherited
hundreds of millions of dollars from his father and used his billionaire
status to launch a TV show and later a presidential campaign.</p>
<p>“For 36 years, I was listed as the poorest man in Congress,” Biden
told donors in California in February. “Not a joke.”</p>
<p>In 2015, Trump declared as part of his candidacy, “I’m really
rich.”</p>
<p>The Republican former president has argued that voters have no need
to see his tax data and that past financial disclosures are more than
sufficient. He maintains that keeping taxes low for the wealthy will
supercharge investment and lead to more jobs, while tax hikes would
crush an economy still recovering from inflation that hit a four-decade
peak in 2022.</p>
<p>“Biden wants to give the IRS even more cash by proposing the largest
tax hike on the American people in history when they are already being
robbed by his record-high inflation crisis,” said Karoline Leavitt,
press secretary for the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>The split goes beyond an ideological difference to a very real
challenge for whoever triumphs in the November election. At the end of
2025, many of the tax cuts that Trump signed into law in 2017 will
expire — setting up an avalanche of choices about how much people across
the income spectrum should pay as the national debt is expected to climb
to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>Including interest costs, extending all the tax breaks could add
another $3.8 trillion to the national debt through 2033, according to an
analysis last year by the Committee for a Responsible Federal
Budget.</p>
<p>Biden would like to keep the majority of the tax breaks, based on his
pledge that no one earning less than $400,000 will have to pay more. But
he released a budget proposal this year with tax increases on the
wealthy and corporations that would raise $4.9 trillion in revenues and
trim forecasted deficits by $3.2 trillion over 10 years.</p>
<p>Still, he’s telling voters that he’s all for letting the Trump-era
tax cuts lapse.</p>
<p>“Does anyone here think the tax code is fair? Raise your hand,” Biden
said Tuesday at a speech in Washington’s Union Station to a crowd
predisposed to dislike Trump’s broad tax cuts that helped many in the
middle class but disproportionately favored wealthier households.</p>
<p>“It added more to the national debt than any presidential term in
history,” Biden continued. “And it’s due to expire next year. And guess
what? I hope to be president because it expires — it’s going to stay
expired.”</p>
<p>Trump has called for higher tariffs on foreign-made goods, which are
taxes that could hit consumers in the form of higher prices. But his
campaign is committed to tax cuts while promising that a Trump
presidency would reduce a national debt that has risen for decades,
including during his Oval Office tenure.</p>
<p>“When President Trump is back in the White House, he will advocate
for more tax cuts for all Americans and reinvigorate America’s energy
industry to bring down inflation, lower the cost of living, and pay down
our debt,” Leavitt said.</p>
<p>Most economists say Trump’s tax cuts could not generate enough growth
to pay down the national debt. An analysis released Friday by Oxford
Economics found that a “full-blown Trump” policy with tax cuts, higher
tariffs and blocking immigration would slow growth and increase
inflation.</p>
<p>Among Biden’s proposals is a “billionaire minimum income tax” that
would apply a minimum rate of 25% on households with a net worth of at
least $100 million.</p>
<p>The tax would directly target billionaires such as Trump, who refused
to release his personal taxes as presidents have traditionally done. But
six years of his tax returns were released in 2022 by Democrats on the
House Ways and Means Committee.</p>
<p>In 2018, Trump earned more than $24 million and paid about 4% of that
in federal income taxes. The congressional panel also found that the IRS
delayed legally mandated audits of Trump during his presidency, with the
panel concluding the audit process was “dormant, at best.”</p>
<p>Biden has publicly released more than two decades of his tax returns.
In 2022, he and his wife, Jill, made $579,514 and paid nearly 24% of
that in federal income taxes, more than double the rate paid by
Trump.</p>
<p>Trump has maintained that his tax records are complicated because of
his use of various tax credits and past business losses, which in some
cases have allowed him to avoid taxes. He also previously declined to
release his tax returns under the claim that the IRS was auditing him
for pre-presidential filings.</p>
<p>His finances recently received a boost from the stock market debut of
Trump Media, which controls Trump’s preferred social media outlet, Truth
Social. Share prices initially surged, adding billions of dollars to
Trump’s net worth, but investors have since soured on the company and
shares by Friday were down more than 50% from their peak.</p>
<p>The former president is also on the hook for $542 million due to
legal judgments in a civil fraud case and penalties owed to the writer
E. Jean Carroll because of statements made by Trump that damaged her
reputation after she accused him of sexual assault.</p>
<p>In the civil fraud case, New York Judge Arthur Engoron looked at the
financial records of the Trump Organization and concluded after looking
at the inflated assets that “the frauds found here leap off the page and
shock the conscience.”</p>

<p>The United States and Israel say they achieved a “spectacular defeat”
over an Iranian aerial attack that sent 300 munitions – more than 100 of

this six-month conflict that threatens to envelop the Middle East? VOA

happen, we don’t even look at each others software. After waiting a

don’t like how betting has invaded sports broadcasting. I don’t like
that it breaks the bond among people who root for one team their whole

love the same teams as I do as family. I like that there are Knicks fans
who also like the Yankees even though I totally despise the Yankees and
everything they (don’t) stand for, but we all love the freaking Knicks
(and ignore the Nets, btw). Before long there won’t be any of us left,
everyone will see sports as a business, an obsession, or their downfall,
because you can’t win at gambling, we all know that. The whole tribal
thing about sports is broken by integrated gambling, it suggests many of
us, maybe eventually most of us, are here not for love of team, rather
they’re feeding an addiction.</p>

<h2 id="us-suggests-israel-need-not-retaliate-against-iran">US suggests
Israel need not retaliate against Iran</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-15, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Top officials in Washington are attempting to avoid a
widening war in the Middle East after Iran launched an unprecedented
attack on Israel with explosive drones and missiles.</p>
<p>“There need to be some consequences here,” said a senior U.S.
official briefing reporters Sunday afternoon on the condition of not
being named.</p>
<p>But U.S. President Joe Biden, in his latest conversation with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, “made very clear to the prime
minister last night that we do have to think carefully and strategically
about risks of escalation,” especially in view of the attack causing
only light damage and no significant casualties, the official said.</p>
<p>Israeli officials insist there will be a response, but the country’s
war Cabinet appears divided on how and when.</p>
<p>If Israel retaliates, it would be doing it alone.</p>
<p>“We would not envision ourselves participating in such a thing,”
replied the senior administration official when asked whether the United
States would participate in any military response to the Iranian
attack.</p>
<p>It was an “incredible military achievement” by Israel, the United
States and other partners in repelling “more than 300 drones and
missiles” launched by Iran, according to White House national security
spokesperson John Kirby.</p>
<p>US Central Command says its forces, supported by US European Command
destroyers, on Saturday and on Sunday morning “successfully engaged and
destroyed more than 80 one-way attack uncrewed aerial vehicles (OWA UAV)
and at least six ballistic missiles intended to strike Israel from Iran
and Yemen. This includes a ballistic missile on its launcher vehicle and
seven UAVs destroyed on the ground in Iranian-backed Houthi controlled
areas of Yemen prior to their launch.”</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a statement late Saturday,
said the explosive aircraft and missiles were launched from the
territories of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.</p>
<p>“We call on Iran to immediately halt any further attacks, including
from its proxy forces, and to deescalate tensions,” Austin said. “We do
not seek conflict with Iran, but we will not hesitate to act to protect
our forces and support the defense of Israel.”</p>
<p>He spoke by phone Sunday for the third time during the weekend with
Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.</p>
<p>Biden convened a hastily arranged video conference Sunday of leaders
of the Group of Seven nations to coordinate a united diplomatic response
to the Iranian attack.</p>
<p>“With its actions, Iran has further stepped toward the
destabilization of the region and risks provoking an uncontrollable
regional escalation. This must be avoided,” the G7 leaders said in a
group statement issued after their meeting. “We will continue to work to
stabilize the situation and avoid further escalation. In this spirit, we
demand that Iran and its proxies cease their attacks, and we stand ready
to take further measures now and in response to further destabilizing
initiatives.”</p>
<p>Biden spoke by phone with Netanyahu on Saturday evening to “reaffirm
America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.”</p>
<p>Biden told Netanyahu, according to media reports, that since the
Iranian attack caused only minimal casualties and damage, Israel should
not retaliate against Iran.</p>
<p>Both Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been calling
leaders in the region to make it clear that while Washington does not
seek a direct military confrontation with Tehran, the United States will
not hesitate to continue to defend Israel.</p>
<p>Biden had rushed back to Washington from a visit to Delaware earlier
Saturday and convened a meeting in the White House Situation Room with
key officials of his Cabinet as Iran launched the unprecedented attack
after vowing to retaliate over an April 1 suspected Israeli airstrike on
Iran’s consulate in Damascus.</p>
<p>Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the
strike.</p>
<p>The U.S. military began moving extra troops and equipment to sites in
the Middle East, defense officials confirmed Friday. It has about 40,000
troops in the region.</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy moved two guided-missile destroyers capable of
intercepting drones and incoming missiles closer to Israel in
anticipation of the Iranian attack, The Wall Street Journal
reported.</p>
<p>U.S. Navy Red Sea forces have previously intercepted long-range
missiles launched toward Israel from Yemen by the Iranian-allied Houthi
forces.</p>
<p>The Biden administration’s response to the Iranian attack will be
closely watched by his political opponents, coming less than seven
months before a general election rematch between the Democratic Party
incumbent and his Republican predecessor, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump, speaking Saturday at a rally in Schnecksville, Pennsylvania,
claimed the attack “would not have happened if we were in office.” He
did not elaborate on how.</p>
<p>“God bless the people of Israel,” he said. “They are under attack
right now. That’s because we show great weakness.”</p>
<p>House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has failed to permit a floor vote on
bipartisan legislation passed by the Senate providing security aid to
Israel and Ukraine, is accusing Biden’s administration of undermining
Israel and appeasing Iran and that “contributed to these terrible
developments.”</p>
<p>A Republican congressman, Mike Turner of the state of Ohio, is
calling for a more robust response from Biden.</p>
<p>“I think the administration needs to take seriously that this attack
has happened. It’s unprecedented and certainly it needs to be viewed as
an escalation. This is an escalating conflict,” Turner, who chairs the
intelligence committee in the House, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press”
program Sunday.</p>
<p>Democrat Chris Coons, of Biden’s home state of Delaware, is urging
lawmakers to pass Biden’s request for military aid to Israel.</p>
<p>“The House should promptly pass this coming week the long-delayed
national security supplemental to ensure that our Israeli allies have
everything they need to defend themselves from attacks by Iran and its
proxies,” he said.</p>

Scottie Scheffler wins 2024 Masters golf tournament</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Augusta, Georgia — American Scottie Scheffler won his second Masters
title with an ice-cool four stroke victory at Augusta National on
Sunday.</p>
<p>Scheffler, the world number one and 2022 Masters winner, shot a final
round four-under par 68 to end on 11-under for the tournament with
Masters first-timer Ludvig Aberg of Sweden finishing as the
runner-up.</p>
<p>It was a classic display of calmness and precision from Scheffler,
who kept his focus after making bogies on the fourth and seventh holes
to run away with the contest on the back nine.</p>
<p>Scheffler began the round with a one-shot lead over fellow American
Collin Morikawa but the contest took a decisive turn on the ninth
hole.</p>
<p>Morikawa double-bogeyed and Scheffler made birdie and the
three-stroke swing left the 24-year-old Aberg his closest challenger
after the turn.</p>
<p>But after Aberg double-bogeyed the 11th, the outcome was in
Scheffler’s safe hands and the 27-year-old Texan made sure of victory
with birdies on 13, 14 and 16.</p>
<p>The win is Scheffler’s third victory of the season coming after his
wins at Bay Hill and the Players Championship last month.</p>

id="ai-generated-fashion-models-could-bring-more-diversity-to-industry-or-leave-it-with-less">AI-generated
fashion models could bring more diversity to industry — or leave it with
less</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Chicago, Illinois — London-based model Alexsandrah has a twin, but
not in the way you’d expect: Her counterpart is made of pixels instead
of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>The virtual twin was generated by artificial intelligence and has
already appeared as a stand-in for the real-life Alexsandrah in a photo
shoot. Alexsandrah, who goes by her first name professionally, in turn
receives credit and compensation whenever the AI version of herself gets
used — just like a human model.</p>
<p>Alexsandrah says she and her alter-ego mirror each other “even down
to the baby hairs.” And it is yet another example of how AI is
transforming creative industries — and the way humans may or may not be
compensated.</p>
<p>Proponents say the growing use of AI in fashion modeling showcases
diversity in all shapes and sizes, allowing consumers to make more
tailored purchase decisions that in turn reduces fashion waste from
product returns. And digital modeling saves money for companies and
creates opportunities for people who want to work with the
technology.</p>
<p>But critics raise concerns that digital models may push human models
— and other professionals like makeup artists and photographers — out of
a job. Unsuspecting consumers could also be fooled into thinking AI
models are real, and companies could claim credit for fulfilling
diversity commitments without employing actual humans.</p>
<p>“Fashion is exclusive, with limited opportunities for people of color
to break in,” said Sara Ziff, a former fashion model and founder of the
Model Alliance, a nonprofit aiming to advance workers’ rights in the
fashion industry. “I think the use of AI to distort racial
representation and marginalize actual models of color reveals this
troubling gap between the industry’s declared intentions and their real
actions.”  </p>
<p>Women of color in particular have long faced higher barriers to entry
in modeling and AI could upend some of the gains they’ve made. Data
suggests that women are more likely to work in occupations in which the
technology could be applied and are more at risk of displacement than
men.</p>
<p>In March 2023, iconic denim brand Levi Strauss &amp; Co. announced
that it would be testing AI-generated models produced by Amsterdam-based
company Lalaland.ai to add a wider range of body types and
underrepresented demographics on its website. But after receiving
widespread backlash, Levi clarified that it was not pulling back on its
plans for live photo shoots, the use of live models or its commitment to
working with diverse models.</p>
<p>“We do not see this (AI) pilot as a means to advance diversity or as
a substitute for the real action that must be taken to deliver on our
diversity, equity and inclusion goals and it should not have been
portrayed as such,” Levi said in its statement at the time.</p>
<p>The company last month said that it has no plans to scale the AI
program.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reached out to several other retailers to ask
whether they use AI fashion models. Target, Kohl’s and fast-fashion
giant Shein declined to comment; Temu did not respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, spokespeople for Nieman Marcus, H&amp;M, Walmart and
Macy’s said their respective companies do not use AI models, although
Walmart clarified that “suppliers may have a different approach to
photography they provide for their products, but we don’t have that
information.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, companies that generate AI models are finding a demand
for the technology, including Lalaland.ai, which was co-founded by
Michael Musandu after he was feeling frustrated by the absence of
clothing models who looked like him.</p>
<p>“One model does not represent everyone that’s actually shopping and
buying a product,” he said. “As a person of color, I felt this painfully
myself.”</p>
<p>Musandu says his product is meant to supplement traditional photo
shoots, not replace them. Instead of seeing one model, shoppers could
see nine to 12 models using different size filters, which would enrich
their shopping experience and help reduce product returns and fashion
waste.</p>
<p>The technology is actually creating new jobs, since Lalaland.ai pays
humans to train its algorithms, Musandu said.</p>
<p>And if brands “are serious about inclusion efforts, they will
continue to hire these models of color,” he added.</p>
<p>London-based model Alexsandrah, who is Black, says her digital
counterpart has helped her distinguish herself in the fashion industry.
In fact, the real-life Alexsandrah has even stood in for a Black
computer-generated model named Shudu, created by Cameron Wilson, a
former fashion photographer turned CEO of The Diigitals, a U.K.-based
digital modeling agency.</p>
<p>Wilson, who is white and uses they/them pronouns, designed Shudu in
2017, described on Instagram as the “The World’s First Digital
Supermodel.” But critics at the time accused Wilson of cultural
appropriation and digital Blackface.</p>
<p>Wilson took the experience as a lesson and transformed The Diigitals
to make sure Shudu — who has been booked by Louis Vuitton and BMW —
didn’t take away opportunities but instead opened possibilities for
women of color. Alexsandrah, for instance, has modeled in-person as
Shudu for Vogue Australia, and writer Ama Badu came up with Shudu’s
backstory and portrays her voice for interviews.</p>
<p>Alexsandrah said she is “extremely proud” of her work with The
Diigitals, which created her own AI twin: “It’s something that even when
we are no longer here, the future generations can look back at and be
like, ‘These are the pioneers.’”</p>
<p>But for Yve Edmond, a New York City area-based model who works with
major retailers to check the fit of clothing before it’s sold to
consumers, the rise of AI in fashion modeling feels more insidious.</p>
<p>Edmond worries modeling agencies and companies are taking advantage
of models, who are generally independent contractors afforded few labor
protections in the U.S., by using their photos to train AI systems
without their consent or compensation.</p>
<p>She described one incident in which a client asked to photograph
Edmond moving her arms, squatting and walking for “research” purposes.
Edmond refused and later felt swindled — her modeling agency had told
her she was being booked for a fitting, not to build an avatar.</p>
<p>“This is a complete violation,” she said. “It was really
disappointing for me.”</p>
<p>But absent AI regulations, it’s up to companies to be transparent and
ethical about deploying AI technology. And Ziff, the founder of the
Model Alliance, likens the current lack of legal protections for fashion
workers to “the Wild West.”</p>
<p>That’s why the Model Alliance is pushing for legislation like the one
being considered in New York state, in which a provision of the Fashion
Workers Act would require management companies and brands to obtain
models’ clear written consent to create or use a model’s digital
replica; specify the amount and duration of compensation, and prohibit
altering or manipulating models’ digital replica without consent.</p>
<p>Alexsandrah says that with ethical use and the right legal
regulations, AI might open up doors for more models of color like
herself. She has let her clients know that she has an AI replica, and
she funnels any inquires for its use through Wilson, who she describes
as “somebody that I know, love, trust and is my friend.” Wilson says
they make sure any compensation for Alexsandrah’s AI is comparable to
what she would make in-person.</p>
<p>Edmond, however, is more of a purist: “We have this amazing Earth
that we’re living on. And you have a person of every shade, every
height, every size. Why not find that person and compensate that
person?”</p>

id="us-judge-tosses-out-lawsuits-against-libyan-commander-accused-of-war-crimes">US
judge tosses out lawsuits against Libyan commander accused of war
crimes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Alexandria, Virginia — A U.S. judge has tossed out a series of civil
lawsuits against a Libyan military commander who used to live in
Virginia and was accused of killing innocent civilians in that country’s
civil war.</p>
<p>At a court hearing Friday, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema said
she had no jurisdiction to preside over a case alleging war crimes
committed in Libya, even though the defendant, Khalifa Haftar, has U.S.
citizenship and lived for more than 20 years in the northern Virginia
suburbs of the nation’s capital as an exile from the regime of Moammar
Gadhafi.</p>
<p>The ruling was a significant reversal of fortune for Haftar. In 2022,
Brinkema entered a default judgment against Haftar after he refused to
sit for scheduled depositions about his role in the fighting that has
plagued the country over the last decade.</p>
<p>But Haftar retained new lawyers who persuaded the judge to reopen the
case and made Haftar available to be deposed. He sat for two separate
depositions in 2022 and 2023 and denied orchestrating attacks against
civilians.</p>
<p>Once a lieutenant to Gadhafi, Haftar defected to the U.S. during the
1980s. He is widely believed to have worked with the CIA during his time
in exile.</p>
<p>He returned to Libya in 2011 to support anti-Gadhafi forces that
revolted against the dictator and killed him. During the country’s civil
war, he led the self-styled Libyan National Army, which controlled much
of the eastern half of Libya, with support from countries including
Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. He continues to hold sway in
the eastern half of the country.</p>
<p>In the lawsuits, first filed in 2019, the plaintiffs say family
members were killed by military bombardments conducted by Haftar’s army
in civilian areas.</p>
<p>The lawsuits also alleged that Haftar and his family owned a
significant amount of property in Virginia, which could have been used
to pay off any judgment that would have been entered against him.</p>
<p>While the lawsuits were tossed out on technical issues over
jurisdiction, one of Haftar’s lawyers, Paul Kamenar, said Haftar denied
any role in the deaths of civilians.</p>
<p>“He’s not this ruthless figure that everyone wants to portray him
as,” Kamenar said in a phone interview Sunday.</p>
<p>Faisal Gill, a lawyer for plaintiffs in one of the three lawsuits
that Brinkema tossed out Friday, said he plans to appeal the
dismissal.</p>
<p>Mark Zaid, lawyer for another set of plaintiffs, called Brinkema’s
ruling perplexing and said he believes that the court’s jurisdiction to
hear the case had already been established at an earlier phase of the
case.</p>
<p>“A U.S. citizen committed war crimes abroad and thus far has escaped
civil accountability,” Zaid said Sunday in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>In court papers, Haftar tried to claim immunity from the suits as a
head of state. At one point, the judge put the cases on pause because
she worried that the lawsuits were being used to influence scheduled
presidential elections in Libya, in which Haftar was a candidate. Those
elections were later postponed.</p>

organizations urge Biden, Trump to commit to presidential debates</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — Twelve news organizations on Sunday urged presumptive
presidential nominees Joe Biden and Donald Trump to agree to debates,
saying they were a “rich tradition” that have been part of every general
election campaign since 1976.</p>
<p>While Trump, who did not participate in debates for the Republican
nomination, has indicated a willingness to take on his 2020 rival, the
Democratic president has not committed to debating him again.</p>
<p>Although invitations have not been formally issued, the news
organizations said it was not too early for each campaign to say
publicly that it will participate in the three presidential and one vice
presidential forums set by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential
Debates.</p>
<p>“If there is one thing Americans can agree on during this polarized
time, it is that the stakes of this election are exceptionally high,”
the organizations said in a joint statement. “Amidst that backdrop,
there is simply no substitute for the candidates debating with each
other, and before the American people, their visions for the future of
our nation.”</p>
<p>ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox, PBS, NBC, NPR and The Associated Press all signed
on to the letter.</p>
<p>Biden and Trump debated twice in 2020. A third debate was canceled
after Trump, then president, tested positive for COVID-19 and would not
debate remotely.</p>
<p>Asked on March 8 whether he would commit to a debate with Trump,
Biden said, “it depends on his behavior.” The president was visibly
miffed by his opponent in the freewheeling first 2020 debate, at one
point saying, “will you shut up?”</p>
<p>Trump campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a
letter this past week that “we have already indicated President Trump is
willing to debate anytime, any place and anywhere — and the time to
start these debates is now.”</p>
<p>They cited the seven 1858 Illinois Senate debates between Abraham
Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, saying “certainly today’s America deserves
as much.”</p>
<p>The Republican National Committee voted in 2022 to no longer
participate in forums sponsored by the Commission on Presidential
Debates. The Trump campaign has not indicated it would adhere to that
but did have some conditions. The campaign managers said the commission
selected a “demonstrably anti-Trump moderator” in then-Fox News host
Chris Wallace in 2020 and wants assurances the commission debates are
fair and impartial.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign also wants the timetable moved up, saying that
many Americans will have already voted by Sept. 16, Oct. 1 and Oct. 9,
the dates of the three debates set by the commission.</p>
<p>The Biden campaign declined comment on the news organizations’
letter, pointing to the president’s earlier statement. There was no
immediate response from the Trump campaign.</p>
<p>But on Saturday, Trump held a rally in northeast Pennsylvania with
two lecterns set up on the stage: one for him to give a speech, the
other to symbolize what he said was Biden’s refusal to debate him. The
second lectern had a placard that read, “Anytime. Anywhere.
Anyplace.”</p>
<p>Midway through his campaign speech, Trump turned to his right and
pointed to the second lectern.</p>
<p>“We have a little, look at this, it’s for him,” he said. “See the
podium? I’m calling on Crooked Joe Biden to debate anytime, anywhere,
any place. Right there. And we have to debate because our country is
going in the wrong direction so badly and while it’s a little bit
typically early we have to debate. We have to explain to the American
people what the hell is going on,” Trump said.</p>
<p>C-SPAN, NewsNation and Univision also joined the letter calling for
debates. Only one newspaper, USA Today, added its voice. The Washington
Post declined a request to join.</p>
<p>Certainly the broadcasters could use the juice that debates may
bring. Television news ratings are down significantly compared with the
2020 campaign, although there are other factors involved, such as
cord-cutting and the pandemic, that increased interest in news four
years ago.</p>
<p>There were no Democratic debates this presidential cycle, and Trump’s
refusal to participate in the Republican forums depressed interest in
them.</p>

6.10 to merge NTSYNC driver for emulating Windows NT synchronization
primitives</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: OS News</p>
<p>Going through my usual scanning of all the “-next” Git subsystem
branches of new code set to be introduced for the next Linux kernel
merge window, a very notable addition was just queued up… Linux 6.10 is
set to merge the NTSYNC driver for emulating the Microsoft Windows NT
synchronization primitives within the kernel for allowing better
performance with Valve’s Steam Play (Proton) and Wine of Windows games
and other apps on Linux. ↫ Michael Larabel The improvements to
performance of games running under Proton this new driver will bring are
legitimately insane. We’re looking at a game-changing addition to the
Linux kernel here, and it’s no surprise, then, to see this effort being
spearheaded by companies like Valve and CodeWeavers.</p>

<p>Kate, KDE’s programming-focused text editor, is, of course, a Qt

Christoph Cullmann, one of the developers of Kate, published a short
blog post with screenshots of Kate running on the three biggest
platforms – Linux/BSD, Windows, and macOS. Sadly, while Haiku gets a
mention, there’s no screenshot of the Haiku version of Kate. Still, it’s
interesting to see the family resemblance.</p>

city asks US Supreme Court: Can homeless people be fined for sleeping
outside?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>GRANTS PASS, Oregon — A pickleball game in this leafy Oregon
community was suddenly interrupted one rainy weekend morning by the
arrival of an ambulance. Paramedics rushed through the park toward a
tent, one of dozens illegally erected by the town’s hundreds of homeless
people, then play resumed as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Mere feet away, volunteers helped dismantle tents to move an
80-year-old man and a woman blind in one eye, who risked being fined for
staying too long. In the distance, a group of boys climbed on a jungle
gym.</p>
<p>The scenes were emblematic of the crisis gripping the small, Oregon
mountain town of Grants Pass, where a fierce fight over park space has
become a battleground for a much larger, national debate on homelessness
that has reached the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The town’s case, set to be heard April 22, has broad implications for
how not only Grants Pass, but communities nationwide address
homelessness, including whether they can fine or jail people for camping
in public. It has made the town of 40,000 the unlikely face of the
nation’s homelessness crisis, and further fueled the debate over how to
deal with it.</p>
<p>“I certainly wish this wasn’t what my town was known for,” Mayor Sara
Bristol told The Associated Press last month. “It’s not the reason why I
became mayor. And yet it has dominated every single thing that I’ve done
for the last 3 1/2 years.”</p>
<p>Officials across the political spectrum — from Democratic Gov. Gavin
Newsom in California, which has nearly 30% of the nation’s homeless
population, to a group of 22 conservative-led states — have filed briefs
in the case, saying lower court rulings have hamstrung their ability to
deal with encampments.</p>
<p>Like many Western communities, Grants Pass has struggled for years
with a burgeoning homeless population. A decade ago, City Council
members discussed how to make it “uncomfortable enough … in our city so
they will want to move on down the road.” From 2013 to 2018, the city
said it issued 500 citations for camping or sleeping in public,
including in vehicles, with fines that could reach hundreds of
dollars.</p>
<p>But a 2018 decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals changed
the calculus. The court, whose jurisdiction includes nine Western
states, held that while communities are allowed to prohibit tents in
public spaces, it violated the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and
unusual punishment to give people criminal citations for sleeping
outside when they had no place else to go.</p>
<p>Four years later, in a case challenging restrictions in Grants Pass,
the court expanded that ruling, holding that civil citations also can be
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Civil rights groups and attorneys for the homeless residents who
challenged the restrictions in 2018 insist people shouldn’t be punished
for lacking housing. Officials throughout the West have overstated the
impact of the court decisions to distract from their own failings, they
argued.</p>
<p>“For years, political leaders have chosen to tolerate encampments as
an alternative to meaningfully addressing the western region’s severe
housing shortage,” the attorneys wrote. “It is easier to blame the
courts than to take responsibility for finding a solution.”</p>
<p>In Grants Pass, the town’s parks, many lining the picturesque Rogue
River, are at the heart of the debate. Cherished for their open spaces,
picnic tables, playgrounds and sports fields, they host everything from
annual boat-racing festivals and vintage car shows to Easter egg hunts
and summer concerts.</p>
<p>They’re also the sites of encampments blighted by illegal drug use
and crime, including a shooting at a park last year that left one person
dead. Tents cluster along riverbanks, next to tennis courts and jungle
gyms, with tarps shielding belongings from the rain. When the sun comes
out, clothes and blankets are strung across tree branches to dry. Used
needles litter the ground.</p>
<p>Grants Pass has just one overnight shelter for adults, the Gospel
Rescue Mission. It has 138 beds, but rules including attendance at daily
Christian services, no alcohol, drugs or smoking and no pets mean many
won’t stay there.</p>
<p>Cassy Leach, a nurse, leads a volunteer group providing food, medical
care and other basic goods to the town’s hundreds of homeless people.
They help relocate their tents to comply with city rules.</p>
<p>At one park last month, she checked on a man who burned his leg after
falling on a torch lighter during a fentanyl overdose and brought him
naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication. In another, she
distributed cans of beans, peas and Chef Boyardee mini ravioli from a
pickup truck.</p>
<p>“Love, hope, community and a safety net is really as important as a
shower and water,” Leach said.</p>
<p>Dre Buetow, 48, from northern California, has been living in his car
for three years after a bone cancer diagnosis and $450,000 in medical
bills. The illness and treatment kept him from returning to his old
tree-trimming job, he said.</p>
<p>Laura Gutowski’s husband died from a pulmonary embolism and she
suddenly found herself, in her 50s, with no income. They didn’t have
life insurance or savings and, within a month, she was sleeping outside
in the city she grew up in.</p>
<p>“I used to love camping,” she said through tears. “And now I can’t
stand it anymore.”</p>
<p>Volunteers like Leach came to her rescue. “They’re angels,” she
said.</p>
<p>But some residents want to limit aid because of the trash left behind
after encampment moves or food handouts. The City Council proposed
requiring outreach groups to register with the city. The mayor vetoed
it, laying bare the discord gripping Grants Pass.</p>
<p>Before the council attempted, unsuccessfully, to override the veto
last month, a self-proclaimed “park watch” group rallied outside City
Hall with signs reading, “Parks are for kids.” Drivers in passing cars
honked their support.</p>
<p>The group regularly posts images of trash, tents and homeless people
on social media. On Sundays, they set up camp chairs in what they say is
a bid to reclaim park space.</p>
<p>Brock Spurgeon says he used to take his grandkids to parks that were
so full it was hard to find an available picnic table. Now, open drug
use and discarded needles have scared families away, he said.</p>
<p>“That was taken away from us when the campers started using the
parks,” he said.</p>
<p>Still, Spurgeon said his own brother died while homeless in a nearby
city, and his son is living in the parks as he struggles with addiction.
Once, he said, he realized with shock that the homeless person covered
with blankets that he stepped past to enter a grocery store was his
son.</p>
<p>“I miss my son every night, and I hold my breath that he won’t OD in
the park,” Spurgeon said.</p>
<p>Mayor Bristol and advocates have sought to open a shelter with fewer
rules, or a designated area for homeless people to camp. But charged
debates emerged over where that would be and who would pay for it.</p>
<p>While support for a designated campground appears to be growing, the
problem remains: Many homeless people in Grants Pass have nowhere else
to live. And some advocates fear a return of strict anti-camping
enforcement will push people to the forest outside town, farther from
help.</p>
<p>Even if the Supreme Court overturns the 9th Circuit’s decisions,
Bristol said, “we still have 200 people who have to go somewhere.”</p>
<p>“We have to accept that homelessness is a reality in America,” she
said.</p>

break loose on Ohio River in Pittsburgh, damaging marina, striking
bridge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PITTSBURGH, USA — More than two dozen river barges broke loose from
their moorings and floated down the Ohio River in Pittsburgh, striking
one bridge that had already been preemptively closed and damaging a
marina, officials said. The boats eventually were pinned to the
riverbank or went over a dam downstream, officials said.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police, fire and emergency medical services responded
around 11:25 p.m. Friday to reports of the barges “floating
uncontrolled” down the river, Pittsburgh Public Safety said in a
statement. The area had been hit by flooding after heavy rains
Thursday.</p>
<p>The Sewickley Bridge was struck by a barge a few minutes before 2
p.m. Saturday, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said. It
“was closed in advance of the strike and will remain closed until our
crews complete an inspection,” spokesperson Steve Cowan said.</p>
<p>Officials in Moon Township, which is connected by the bridge to the
community of Sewickley, earlier said the span would be temporarily
closed “due to unmanned barge passing through.”</p>
<p>Eleven of the 26 barges that broke free were quickly contained to one
side by another towing vessel just downstream, said Cmdr. Justin Jolley
of the Coast Guard marine safety unit in Pittsburgh. Nine others were
collected at the Emsworth lock and dam downstream.</p>
<p>Five or six barges went through the dam. Four ended up just
downstream at a lock and dam, while another ended up on the bank of the
river and was stabilized. Marine safety units were searching for one
barge unaccounted for, Jolley said.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh public safety officials reported damage to Peggy’s Harbor,
a marina on the river. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the
McKees Rocks Bridge was also closed as a precaution but later reopened
following inspection.</p>
<p>Twenty-three of the barges were carrying dry cargo, mostly coal, and
at least one was loaded with fertilizer, according to the owner, Jolley
said. Three were empty. There were no hazardous materials on any of the
vessels, the city said.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard put out a broadcast notice to mariners to inform them
about the potential hazard, but high water was preventing traffic on the
river, Jolley said.</p>
<p>The barges were owned or operated by Campbell Transportation Co., the
city’s statement said. Jolley said Coast Guard officials were working
with the owner on a salvage plan. Pennsylvania State Police and other
agencies were also alerted.</p>
<p>The vulnerability of bridges to strikes from barges and ships came
into stark relief last month when a container ship rammed a support of
the major Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, collapsing the span and
leading to the deaths or presumptive deaths of six road workers.</p>

<p>date: 2024-04-14, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog</p>
<p>There are really two major Republican political stories dominating
the news these days. The more obvious of the two is the attempt by
former president Donald Trump and his followers to destroy American
democracy. The other story is older, the one that led to Trump but that
stands at least a bit apart from him. It is the story of a national
shift away from the supply-side ideology of Reagan Republicans toward an
