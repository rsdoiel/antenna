The GOP wants to be clear that it’s pro-cryptocurrency. The official

“defend the right to mine bitcoin.” We’ll hear more about the
intersection of digital assets and politics. Plus, dinners in Spain tend
to start pretty darn late — after 9 p.m. on average. One reason is that
the working day runs deep into the evening. But could things be
changing?

</p>
<p>
The train delays have affected an especially large population. The
Northeast Corridor is the most trafficked commuter rail system in the
country, with over 750,000 daily commuters. In late June, Amtrak
notified customers that trains in the corridor could face delays of up
to an hour in the coming weeks as heat interfered with tracks and
overhead power lines. Since it issued that warning, tens of thousands of
people have experienced heat-related delays.

Amtrak estimates that severe weather, including extreme heat, storms,
and floods, will incur $220 million in lost revenue in the coming
decade. That will only compound problems for the beleaguered rail
company, which is facing a backlog of $45 billion in Northeast Corridor
repairs, <em><em>Fortune</em></em>
<a href="https://fortune.com/2024/05/10/amtrak-upgrades-aging-rail-network-bridges-tunnels-infrastructure-bill-federal-funding/" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>.
Some of the corridor’s bridges and tunnels were built more than a
century ago, and the price tag for repairs has been accumulating for
years.
</p>
<p>
Making the necessary infrastructure improvements won’t just mean
replacing old equipment with new. It will also require that new
equipment be able to withstand high temperatures that were far less
common just a decade ago. Solids, and especially metals, expand in the
heat, which can warp rail lines if they’re not protected against high
temperatures. Overhead power lines, meanwhile, tend to sag on hot days,
Mikhail Chester, the director of the Metis Center for Infrastructure and
Sustainable Engineering at Arizona State University, told me. Most light
rail lines have counterweights to balance that sag, but those often
aren’t heavy enough to counteract the extreme effects of high heat.
</p>
<p>
Asphalt, too, tends to expand and soften in the heat, causing headaches
for motorists and road crews. In

roads so badly they were forced to close, and traffic on Wisconsin’s

While cities in the Southeast and Southwest have also reckoned with
heat-related challenges, it’s notable that many of the most pronounced
infrastructure meltdowns recently have occurred in ordinarily cooler
parts of the country. The reasons are twofold, Chester told me. First,
cities in the hottest part of the country tend to be newer, meaning they
built more of their base infrastructure in more recent (and warmer)
decades. Second, these cities are simply more used to the heat. In
Phoenix, it’s not unusual for a summer day to top 110 degrees Fahrenheit
— on Friday, when I spoke to Chester, it reached 116 degrees. That kind
of heat poses an undeniable risk to outdoor workers, young athletes, and
under-resourced populations, Chester said, but it also means that civil
engineers build infrastructure with heat in mind.
</p>
<p>
In Phoenix, “the infrastructure is much more designed to the
environments — these high temperatures — than a place like Rhode Island
is,” Chester said. Whereas Phoenix has always been hot, the climate in
the Northeast is “significantly different at this point, climate change
being one of those major changes.”

That’s not to say Southwestern infrastructure is anything close to
heatproof. Researchers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory found that
pavement temperatures on Phoenix streets frequently exceed 120 degrees
on hot days, with many reaching between 140 and 160 degrees.
Skin-to-pavement contact at those temperatures can cause severe burns;
one Arizona burn center saw a 60% uptick in severe contact burns between
2022 and 2023,
<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2024/07/10/heat-sidewalks-roads-burns-nasa" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u><em><em>Axios</em></em></u><u>
reported</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
National media coverage of climate-resilient infrastructure tends to
focus on large federal legislation such as the Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law and Inflation Reduction Act, but the standards set by professional
societies like the American Society of Civil Engineers are at least as —
if not more — influential, and far less sensitive to the ebbs and flows
of national politics. Though not legally binding, these standards are
often used as a model for local licensing authorities.
</p>
<p>
“A lot of states and regions and cities in the United States will look
to those guidelines to adapt,” Chester said.

<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
If you’re waiting for permission to build something, or if you want to
see how well something has worked for your peers or competitors before
you implement it yourself, you will never, ever innovate.
</p>
<p>
That’s the trap that news media seems to be in: nobody wants to be the
first to build something new. Perhaps it’s that times are so dire that
experimentation feels like too much of a risk; perhaps it’s just an
extension of top-down editorial culture. But there’s nothing out-there
in media technology right now. I’m aware of some stuff coming down the
pipe that I’m really excited about, but the most innovative thing that’s
actually been <em>shipped</em> is getting people to subscribe by
addicting them to puzzle games. Forgive me for thinking that’s not
particularly exciting.
</p>
<p>
How can the news industry break out of its shell? How can it act like
technology is something that it can shape, rather than something that
just happens to it? How can it put value not just in product management
but actual nuts-and-bolts technical innovation?
</p>
<p>
This feels existentially important.

Thinking about it. Working on it.

<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content aside-content">
<p>
I’m, uh, <em>very bad</em> at task management. I wouldn’t want to
pathologize, but I’ve never been a particularly <em>organized</em>
person. I’ve always aspired to be more organized, but I’ve never found a
tool or a methodology that really works for me. They were either too
rigid and opinionated or brought too much overhead: I had to remember to
use them, and that was enough of a blocker to not.
</p>
<p>
Over the last two months, everything has — weirdly — changed.
</p>
<p>
Someone mentioned <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> over on
Threads, and although I had a vague memory of trying it years ago and it
not working for me, I decided to install it again. Maybe it was just the
right time for me now, or maybe the design has evolved, but it clicked
pretty much immediately.
</p>
<p>
There are two things that make it great:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
It’s everywhere I work
</li>
<li>
It gets the hell out of my way
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Whenever I need to remember to do something, I press a key combo — I’ve
configured shift-command-T — and a modal lets me quickly tap it in using
relatively natural language. That’s a similar workflow to what I’ve been
doing with <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> for years and
years, so adding this new combo isn’t a giant feat of muscle memory.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/6697c7322274fc298e0379b2/thumb.png" alt="Todoist modal" width="1024" height="340">
</p>
<p>
Then, whenever I want to check what’s on my plate, I can bring up the
app (desktop via ctrl-command-T, or phone), or click the toolbar icon in
my browser to bring up the browser extension version. Because I spend
most of my life in my browser, that’s particularly handy. It’s just
<em>always there</em>.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://werd.io/file/6697c74220dfe2a1880b1a32/thumb.png" alt="Todoist desktop app" width="1024" height="792">
</p>
<p>
I’ve found myself adding new tasks via modal while I’ve been in
meetings, so I don’t forget to follow up. Or I’ll be in a Google Doc and
add a task the same way. (There’s a way to automatically sync Google
Tasks with Todoist, but I don’t use that — I’d rather have direct
control over my task inbox.)
</p>
<p>
It’s made me more productive, more organized, and as a result, much less
anxious. And I feel really good about it.
</p>
<p>
This post isn’t an ad, by the way. It’s just so rare that I really love
a piece of software, so I thought I’d let you know.

The agenda for this year’s COP29 U.N. climate summit is coming into

Azerbaijan’s environment minister as well as a former state oil company

1.5 degree Celsius warming limit, submit climate adaptation plans, and
finalize Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which

<p>I never had a regular “lunch break” until recently. Early in my

thing as a break, only a stolen minute or two here and there to pee or
wolf down whatever food you can scrounge or nap in a chair if it’s the
middle of the night and you’re on call. We did get a $5 meal coupon for
the hospital cafeteria which could get you a cup of terrible coffee and

<em>Jesse is on vacation until August, so this is a special, Rob-only
summer episode of Shift Key.</em>
</p>
<p class="drop-caps">
Shipping is the backbone of the modern economy. At least 80% of all
goods worldwide are shipped as ocean cargo, and the global economy rises
and falls on the free movement of gigantic ships across the sea. But
container ships and bulk carriers burn what’s known as bunker fuel, one
of the dirtiest fossil fuels. The international shipping industry
generates 3% of global carbon emissions, a proportion that’s projected
to rise through the century.
</p>
<p>
Most proposals to decarbonize ocean freight have focused on using
ammonia or other zero-carbon liquid fuels. But Fleetzero, a Bill
Gates-backed startup, is trying to use the only technology that it says
can get cheap enough to compete with oil: batteries. The Alabama-based
company is building batteries big enough to hybridize — and, eventually,
power outright — the world’s largest ships.
</p>
<p>
This week, Rob chats with Steven Henderson, the cofounder and CEO of
Fleetzero and a graduate of the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. They talk
about Steven’s history in the oil and gas industry, why batteries will
beat liquid fuels, and how to put out a fire in the middle of the ocean.

This episode of Shift Key is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Steven Henderson:</strong> What’s good about batteries, you can
step into that, where you can use existing infrastructure and build on
it. You don’t need a new fundamental technology to do this. The numbers
to do this are not outside the realm of possibility.And if you think
about it in terms of global … it’s about one-fifth of what you would
need for electric cars and trucks.<br/> <br/> So it’s not — yeah, these
are big numbers. But if you think about an electric future, this is one
of many parts, you know, so this is not going to be the hardest part on
the grid. In fact, it’s a bunch easier because you don’t have to go send
it across the country, and there are generating capabilities in and
around ports, and you can use existing stuff. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I would imagine even switching a ship
from bunker fuel to electricity generated by natural gas, which is often
just right there would be …<br/> <br/> <strong>Henderson: </strong>Yeah,
it’s a huge savings from carbon. And honestly, if you went to coal, it’s
still cleaner. Ships, because of just the way they operate, there’s CO2
emissions, but it’s a huge SOx and NOx, it’s a sulfur and nitrous oxides
emission. And at least with a stationary coal powered plant, at least in
the West, there’s regulations on what you can send out the stack. When
you’re in the middle of the ocean, these things, you know, sometimes
they’re choking up some pretty nasty stuff.<br/> <br/> So it’s an
advantage, even if you go from coal. Obviously, we hope that all
electricity coming into this is going to be clean over time. But if you
suddenly have, <em><em>oh, I need 100 megawatts of power, and I need to,
you know, swap out this power plant</em></em> — well, what if I need 300
megawatts of power? Now I’m going to build a new power plant, and the
economics on that are going to stand on their own, and I can build it
clean from the beginning, so I don’t have to scrap the existing
infrastructure to make the grid clean. <br/> <br/> So that’s why it’s
super important to electrify the consumers, and that increased demand on
the grid is how you clean up the grid.

id="increased-security-around-trump-is-apparent-agents-wall-him-off-from-rnc-crowds">Increased
security around Trump is apparent, agents wall him off from RNC
crowds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Milwaukee —  On the floor of the Republican National Convention
Tuesday evening, vice presidential candidate JD Vance greeted and shook
hands with excited delegates as he walked toward his seat.</p>
<p>It was a marked contrast from former President Donald Trump, who
entered the hall a few minutes later and was separated from supporters
by a column of Secret Service agents. His ear still bandaged after an
attempted assassination, Trump closely hugged the wall. Instead of
handshakes or hellos for those gathered, he offered fist pumps to the
cameras.</p>
<p>The contrast underscores the new reality facing Trump after a gunman
opened fire at his rally in Pennsylvania Saturday, raising serious
questions about the agency that is tasked with protecting the president,
former presidents and major-party candidates. Trump’s campaign must also
adjust to a new reality after he came millimeters from death or serious
injury — and as law enforcement warns of the potential for more
political violence.</p>
<p>Trump campaign officials declined to comment on the stepped-up
security and how it might impact his interactions going forward.</p>
<p>“We do not comment on President Trump’s security detail. All
questions should be directed to the United States Secret Service,” said
Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung.</p>
<p>Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose agency oversees
the Secret Service, said Monday that he could not discuss “specifics of
the protection or the enhancements made, as they involve sensitive
tactics and procedures. I can say, however, that personnel and other
protective resources, technology, and capabilities have been added.”</p>
<p>The Secret Service had already stepped up Trump’s protection in the
days before the attack following an unrelated threat from Iran, two U.S.
officials said Tuesday. But that extra security didn’t stop the gunman,
who fired from an adjacent roof, from killing one audience member and
injuring two others along with Trump.</p>
<p>The FBI and Homeland Security officials remain “concerned about the
potential for follow-on or retaliatory acts of violence following this
attack,” according to a joint intelligence bulletin by Homeland Security
and the FBI and obtained by The Associated Press. The bulletin warned
that lone actors and small groups will “continue to see rallies and
campaign events as attractive targets.”</p>
<p>Underscoring the security risks, a man armed with an AK-47 pistol,
wearing a ski mask and carrying a tactical backpack was taken into
custody Monday near the Fiserv Forum, where the convention is being
held.</p>
<p>The attack has led to stepped-up security not only for Trump.
President Joe Biden’s security has also been bolstered, with more agents
surrounding him as he boarded Air Force One to Las Vegas on Monday
night. Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also received Secret
Service protection in the shooting’s wake.</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign has also responded in other ways, including placing
armed security at all hours outside their offices in Florida and
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Trump has already scheduled his next rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan,
on Saturday. That’s where he will appear with Vance for their first
event as a presidential ticket.</p>
<p>But the new posture complicates, at least for now, the interactions
Trump regularly has with supporters as he signs autographs, shakes hands
and poses for selfies at events and on airplane tarmacs.</p>

id="washington-seoul-alliance-is-a-nuclear-alliance-us-official-says">Washington-Seoul
alliance is a ‘nuclear alliance,’ US official says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A high-ranking U.S. official stressed Tuesday that the
U.S.-South Korea alliance is a “nuclear alliance,” reinforcing the South
Korean government’s description of the two allies, after the United
States and South Korea signed new deterrence guidelines last week.</p>
<p>Vipin Narang, U.S. acting assistant secretary of defense for Space
Policy, told VOA’s Korean Service in an exclusive interview that “when
we formally extend nuclear deterrence to our allies, it is a nuclear
alliance, and South Korea is an example of that.”</p>
<p>Narang explained that it would be similar to what the United States
has with the European allies through NATO.</p>
<p>“NATO publicly says, for example, that so long as nuclear weapons
exist, NATO will be a nuclear alliance. And the relationship with ROK,
similarly, is a formal extension of U.S. nuclear,” he said, referring to
South Korea with the abbreviated form of its official name, the Republic
of Korea. “We commit to defend South Korea with all capabilities.”</p>
<p>South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said earlier on Tuesday in a
Cabinet meeting that South Korea’s alliance with the United States has
been upgraded to a “nuclear-based alliance,” adding that the U.S nuclear
assets will now be “specially assigned to missions on the Korean
Peninsula” under the newly agreed guidelines between the two allies.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Yoon met U.S. President Joe Biden on the sidelines of
the NATO summit in Washington, reaffirming their commitments to the
Washington Declaration unveiled in 2023, which outlines the two
countries’ commitment to engage in deeper dialogue and information
sharing to strengthen nuclear deterrence efforts on the Korean
Peninsula.</p>
<p>According to the joint statement released after the two leaders’
latest meeting, Biden reiterated that the U.S. commitment to extended
deterrence to South Korea is backed by “the full range of U.S.
capabilities, including nuclear.”</p>
<p>In line with such a move, Narang, who co-chairs the Nuclear
Consultative Group, a bilateral body set up by the United States and
South Korea under the Washington Declaration, met his South Korean
counterpart, Cho Chang Lae, in Washington last week and signed “the
United States and Republic of Korea Guidelines for Nuclear Deterrence
and Nuclear Operations on the Korean Peninsula.”</p>
<p>The guidelines, according to the Department of Defense, provide
principles and procedures to assist policymakers and military officials
of both countries “in maintaining an effective nuclear deterrence policy
and posture.”</p>
<p>Narang emphasized that the guidelines would help the Nuclear
Consultative Group (NCG) evolve in accordance with the threats faced by
the U.S.-South Korea alliance.</p>
<p>“The guidelines document is the not the end, it’s the beginning, and
sort of sets up the NCG as an enduring body,” he said. “The NCG is a
living body, and the work streams evolve with the threat environment and
the capabilities, just as North Korea’s capabilities continue to expand
and diversify.”</p>
<p>However, he made it clear that only the U.S. president will be able
to authorize the use and employment of U.S. nuclear weapons, while
underscoring Washington and Seoul will be approaching the extended
deterrence “as equal partners.”</p>
<p>“We have extended deterrence relationships. We need conventional
support from our allies,” he stressed.</p>
<p>His remarks come amid growing skepticism in South Korea over the U.S.
extended deterrence, especially after Russia and North Korea signed a
defense pact, which indicated Moscow’s willingness to engage in
full-fledged military cooperation with Pyongyang.</p>
<p>An increasing number of South Korean people are calling for South
Korea’s own nuclear weapons, arguing that the U.S.-ROK alliance’s
existing deterrence strategy would not be enough to protect South Korea
from the possible attacks from North Korea, if it joins hands with
Russia.</p>
<p>The acting assistant secretary of defense gave a strong warning
against South Korea having its own nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>“It would be in violation of the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty),” Narang said, adding that South Korea would probably face
international sanctions.</p>
<p>He also suggested that Seoul would be “an international pariah” and
would become vulnerable to North Korea’s nuclear attacks during the time
it is pursuing nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Experts in Washington remained cautious about what the new guidelines
could mean for the extended deterrence for South Korea.</p>
<p>“It shows that the United States is taking seriously South Korea as a
partner in all aspects of defense,” said Scott Snyder, president of
Korea Economic Institute of America.</p>
<p>Snyder told VOA’s Korean Service on Tuesday that the decision to
employ a nuclear weapon should be made in a closely integrated manner
between Seoul and Washington.</p>
<p>“If it’s not integrated, the alliance will fail,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that the decision will heavily depend on the U.S.
inclination.</p>
<p>Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, told
VOA’s Korean Service on Tuesday that it is difficult to see the
U.S.-South Korea alliance as a “nuclear alliance.”</p>
<p>“If South Korea has been given a role in planning the nuclear
options, yes, but the U.S. has been implying that that hasn’t occurred,”
Bennett said.</p>
<p>“If they are a nuclear alliance, then it ought to describe in what
way it’s a nuclear alliance – is South Korea being included in planning
how nuclear weapons will be used? That’s what President Yoon asked for.
It’s not clear to me.”</p>

<h2
id="republicans-lean-into-trumps-border-message-during-a-convention-night-focused-on-immigration">Republicans
lean into Trump’s border message during a convention night focused on
immigration</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Immigration took center stage as the Republican National
Convention resumed Tuesday, with speakers spotlighting a key element of
former President Donald Trump’s political brand that helped endear him
to the GOP base when he began his first campaign in 2015.</p>
<p>Among speakers slated for Tuesday night were families who’ve been
impacted by violent crime — part of a GOP strategy to link crime to
border policies. They include the family of Rachel Morin, a Maryland
woman whom prosecutors say was killed and raped by a fugitive from El
Salvador and whose story has been frequently highlighted by Trump on the
campaign trail.</p>
<p>Immigration has long been one of Trump’s banner issues, as he has
criticized the unprecedented number of migrants entering the country
illegally through the U.S. border with Mexico. The numbers of
unauthorized crossings have fallen abruptly after President Joe Biden
issued a rule suspending many asylum claims at the border.</p>
<p>At rallies and other campaign events, Trump has pointed to examples
of migrants who committed heinous crimes and has blamed migration for
the trafficking of drugs like fentanyl, even though federal data
suggests many people smuggling fentanyl across the border are U.S.
citizens. He has vowed to carry out the largest deportation operation in
U.S. history.</p>
<p>Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric has also strayed into talking points
not backed by evidence, including unfounded claims that migrants are
entering the country to vote in the 2024 election.</p>
<p>Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the House majority leader, made that
statement in his remarks, declaring, “Biden and Harris want illegals to
vote now that they’ve opened up the border.”</p>
<p>Senate candidates who were addressing the convention Tuesday not only
blamed Biden for the number of migrants crossing the border, but just as
often faulted Vice President Kamala Harris, whom Republicans have
increasingly focused on amid speculation that she could replace Biden as
the Democratic nominee after the president’s poor debate
performance.</p>
<p>The GOP candidates, mindful of their own races, sought to blame their
Democratic opponents as well. Pennsylvania candidate David McCormick,
for example, tied in his challenger, Sen. Bob Casey, with the term
“Biden-Harris-Casey wide open borders.”</p>
<p>Kari Lake, the party’s Senate candidate in Arizona, stuck to a
message that appealed largely to the GOP base and her reputation as a
former television news anchor turned conservative firebrand. She blasted
the “fake news” for spending “the last eight years lying about President
Donald Trump and his amazing patriotic supporters.” She also blamed
Biden and Democrats for the situation on the U.S.-Mexico border, saying
they’re “full of bad ideas.”</p>
<p>In the latest signal the party is solidifying to take on Biden in
November, several of Trump’s fiercest GOP primary rivals will also speak
Tuesday. They include former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Florida
Gov. Ron DeSantis and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.</p>
<p>Trump’s survival of an attempted assassination Saturday at a rally in
Pennsylvania was on the minds of many inside the hall. One of the
delegates in the crowd could be seen with a folded white piece of paper
over his ear — an apparent tribute to the bandage Trump wore when he
entered the hall Monday to a roaring crowd.</p>
<p>Scalise, who was injured in a politically motivated shooting in 2017
while he was practicing for a charity baseball game, spoke of his own
experience when he touched on Trump’s attack.</p>
<p>“While I was fighting for my life, Donald Trump was one of the first
to come to console my family at the hospital. That’s the kind of leader
he is. Courageous under fire, compassionate towards others,” Scalise
said.</p>
<p>In the wake of Saturday’s attempt on Trump’s life, there was a
heightened focus on security at the convention, which drew thousands of
people to downtown Milwaukee, including a number of high-profile elected
officials.</p>
<p>A man armed with an AK-47 pistol and wearing a ski mask was taken
into custody Monday, the convention’s first day, near the Fiserv Forum
where the convention is being held, a federal law enforcement official
said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old was arrested after being encountered by U.S. Capitol
Police and Homeland Security Investigations agents who said he was
acting suspicious, according to the official, who was not authorized to
publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Police found the weapon in his backpack, the official said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, five Ohio police officers who were in Wisconsin for the
convention shot a man who was in a knife fight near the convention,
killing him, Milwaukee’s police chief said.</p>
<p>The man who police shot had a knife in each hand and refused police
commands, Milwaukee Chief Jeffrey Norman said at a news conference. Two
knives were recovered from the scene, the chief said.</p>
<p>Trump and Vance were expected to appear in the hall each of the last
three nights of the convention. Vance will speak Wednesday and Trump
will speak Thursday.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Lawrence Tabas said he hoped
the assassination attempt on Trump would reset the tone nationally,
beginning with Trump’s scheduled remarks Thursday.</p>
<p>“After a brush with death, I do believe — going through that — that
his message will be better, and I think will appeal to our better
emotions,” Tabas said in an interview after the Pennsylvania GOP’s
delegation breakfast in suburban Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Trump, who has long decried rivals with harsh language and talked
about prosecuting opponents if he wins a second term, seemed poised to
deliver a more toned-down speech. His eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., said
in an Axios interview outside the RNC that he spent three or four hours
going through his father’s convention speech with him, “trying to
de-escalate some of that rhetoric.”</p>
<p>“I think it lasts,” the younger Trump said of the change in his
father’s rhetoric. “There are events that change you for a couple
minutes, and there are events that change you permanently.”</p>

Islamist rulers silent on attempted assassination of Trump</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Iran’s Islamist rulers have made no public comment on
the attempted assassination of former U.S. President Donald Trump in the
three days since the shooting attack on the man whom they have long seen
as their nemesis and targeted with threats of vengeance since he left
office. </p>
<p>The only references in Iranian state media to Saturday’s attack on
Trump have been articles citing details of the shooting at his election
rally in Pennsylvania, showing images of the aftermath and amplifying
conspiracy theories about whether it was real or staged.</p>
<p>Iran has threatened revenge against Trump and his key aides for
carrying out the January 2020 assassination of top Iranian commander
Qassem Soleimani in a Baghdad drone strike. It was part of what Trump
called a campaign of “maximum pressure” against Tehran for its nuclear
and other perceived malign activities.</p>
<p>Since then, one of the most explicit threats against Trump has come
from Amir Ali Hajizadeh, aerospace chief of Iran’s top military force,
the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). He told state TV in
February 2023 that “we are looking to kill Trump” to avenge
Soleimani. </p>
<p>There is no indication of Iranian involvement in the Trump rally
shooting, with U.S. authorities naming only one suspect, the 20-year-old
American male shooter whom U.S. Secret Service personnel shot and killed
at the scene.</p>
<p>CNN reported on Tuesday that the Secret Service had increased
security around Trump “in recent weeks” in response to an alleged
Iranian assassination plot that U.S. authorities purportedly learned
about from intelligence attributed to an unidentified “human
source.” </p>
<p>The Washington Post and New York Times published their own reports on
the alleged Iranian threat, sourcing it to unnamed U.S. officials. </p>
<p>Iran’s U.N. Mission in New York told VOA the accusations are
“unsubstantiated and malicious.”</p>
<p>“Trump is a criminal who must be prosecuted and punished in a court
of law for ordering the assassination of General Soleimani. Iran has
chosen the legal path to bring him to justice,” the mission said in a
statement.</p>
<p>U.S. Secret Service communications chief Anthony Guglielmi responded
to the CNN report by telling VOA that his security agency and others are
“constantly receiving new potential threat information and taking action
to adjust resources, as needed.”</p>
<p>“We cannot comment on any specific threat stream other than to say
that the Secret Service takes threats seriously and responds
accordingly,” Guglielmi wrote. </p>
<p>One of the Iranian state media reports highlighting conspiracy
theories about Saturday’s incident was published by the IRGC-run Tasnim
news agency on Sunday.</p>
<p>It published a collage of photos of the bloodied former president
with a superimposed three-word headline in Persian: “Blood and pig.”</p>
<p>Other state media articles published photos of Trump defiantly
raising and pumping his fist to his supporters after Secret Service
agents helped him to get back on his feet. </p>
<p>Shahram Kholdi, an Iranian Canadian teacher of Middle East history at
Canada’s University of Waterloo, discussed Iran’s state media coverage
of the shooting in the Tuesday edition of VOA’s Flashpoint Global Crises
program.</p>
<p>The following interview transcript is edited for brevity and
clarity. </p>
<p>VOA: Why would Iran allow its state media to publish photos of the
wounded former president showing what many Americans see as his
triumphant stance in the face of danger?</p>
<p>Shahram Kholdi, University of Waterloo, Canada: The Iranian regime’s
hardcore supporters in the Basiji paramilitary force and the IRGC — the
people who are willing to kill and die to keep this regime in power —
they don’t see what you see as a positive. They see the weakness, they
see division in the American masses, they see fractures in the U.S.
democratic system. And the regime actually uses those pictures of Trump
to reinforce this propaganda trope that the U.S. is a facade of a
democracy, that there is something more sinister happening behind the
scenes.</p>
<p>We should not be surprised to see the Iranian regime’s propaganda
machine focus on such sinister scenarios in the next few weeks. Even
though their propaganda machine is heavily equipped and well-manned, it
has been only a few days since the shooting, and it takes time for them
to churn out these kinds of stories.</p>
<p>VOA: Given Trump’s record of being tough on Iran, does the Iranian
leadership have any fear that highlighting his survival of an
assassination attempt will boost his election prospects and return him
to power?</p>
<p>Kholdi: Iranian officials are fearful of that. There has been an
atypical restraint by officials who are generally quick to react and
make all sorts of preposterous statements on such occasions. They did
not do so this time. They are on their toes right now.</p>
<p>The regime’s Chinese and Russian allies may have assured Tehran that
if Trump is reelected, they will protect its interests in any
negotiations with him.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s failure to stop U.S.-sanctioned Iranian oil
being from exported to China, and to stop Iran from assisting Russia’s
war effort in Ukraine, also has emboldened the regime.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, given the prospect of the Islamic republic
once again facing the massive pressure campaign that Trump previously
imposed on it, with a massive reduction in Iranian oil production and
exports and interceptions of tankers, I think the regime is erring on
the side of caution in its response to the assassination attempt. But
the Chinese and Russians may have advised them to do so. I wouldn’t
attribute that to any impeccable wisdom on their part.</p>

id="biden-stands-ground-on-gun-policy-asks-americans-to-cool-down">Biden
stands ground on gun policy, asks Americans to cool down</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>white house — With the recent assassination attempt against former
President Donald Trump, the conversation around guns and gun policy is
heating up — even as President Joe Biden is asking the country to cool
down.</p>
<p>This is the first assassination attempt on a former or current U.S.
president since 1981, when Ronald Reagan was shot</p>
<p>“First of all, that is preposterous,” said U.S. Secretary of Homeland
Security Alejandro Mayorkas when asked about rumors that the
assassination attempt was an inside job involving the current
administration.</p>
<p>“It is also dangerous to propagate rumors that are so unequivocally
false and provocative,” he said at a Monday news briefing. “As the
president so powerfully said to the entire nation, we have to tamp down
the rhetoric in this country.”</p>
<p>U.S. gun policy may see particular focus in campaigns and debates in
the final approach to the 2024 presidential election.</p>
<p>Biden, even before the recent shooting, has been a strong advocate
for stricter gun policy.</p>
<p>Biden served as vice president under President Barack Obama, who
tried to tighten gun policy following the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook
Elementary school that killed 26 people, mostly 6- and 7-year-olds, but
was unable to pass major gun legislation.</p>
<p>After the Sandy Hook shooting, Obama asked Biden to lead a more
concrete initiative on gun reform, and Biden met with a range of
citizens to seek their thoughts on gun policy.</p>
<p>Trump has advocated a less stringent gun policy. His campaign calls
for deregulation of firearms, and he has said he will undo some
executive actions introduced by Biden.</p>
<p>White House reaffirms position</p>
<p>At the news briefing with Mayorkas on Monday, White House press
secretary Karine Jean-Pierre affirmed Biden’s position on gun
policy.</p>
<p>“The president has been, obviously, a strong advocate on gun control.
He has been throughout his career as a senator, as vice president, as
now as president,” Jean-Pierre said in answer to a question from
VOA.</p>
<p>She noted that Congress in 2022 approved the first major gun safety
legislation in 30 years. “The president led on that effort and was able
to get that done. … The president has signed more than two dozen
executive actions [on gun control],” she said.</p>
<p>‘Lower the temperature’</p>
<p>This week, Biden has also condemned the recent violence, asking the
country to minimize its divisiveness.</p>
<p>“We have to lower the temperature … there is no place in America for
violence. It is important that we are really clear about that,” said
Jean-Pierre when asked if Biden plans to tone down his political
rhetoric.</p>
<p>The message from the White House comes after Biden called Trump a
“threat to democracy” on several occasions. Trump has repeatedly said
“you will not have a country” if Biden is re-elected.</p>
<p>J.D. Vance, Donald Trump’s recently chosen candidate for vice
president, blamed Biden’s political rhetoric for the assassination
attempt.</p>
<p>“Today is not just some isolated incident. The central premise of the
Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian
fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to
President Trump’s attempted assassination,” he posted on X shortly after
the incident.</p>
<p>In a Monday interview with NBC News, Biden said he regretted saying
“it was time to put Trump in the bull’s-eye.” But he defended saying
that the former president is a “threat.”</p>
<p>“Look, how do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real,
when a president says things like he says?” Biden said in the
interview</p>
<p>Some analysts doubt that Biden’s call for a calmer climate will bring
about big changes to the political landscape.</p>
<p>“I think the immediate effect [after the shooting] is going to be
that it will escalate violent rhetoric and that people are going to be
more vehement and vocal in vilifying their political rivals,” Valentine
said.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I think that’s where we’re at, and that’s what we’re
beginning to see already.”</p>
<p>Anita Powell contributed to this report from the White House.</p>

<h2
id="vice-presidential-nominee-vance-calls-china-biggest-threat-to-our-country">Vice
presidential nominee Vance calls China ‘biggest threat to our
country’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-17, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — In his short time in the U.S. Senate, J.D. Vance, the
newly tapped Republican vice presidential nominee, has been a hawk on
China.</p>
<p>He has introduced legislation to restrict Chinese access to U.S.
financial markets and to protect U.S. higher education from Chinese
influence.</p>
<p>In an interview with Fox News shortly after being named as former
President Donald Trump’s running mate on Monday, Vance called China “the
biggest threat” to the United States.</p>
<p>When asked about Russia’s war in Ukraine, Vance said Trump would
negotiate with Moscow and Kyiv to “bring this thing to a rapid close so
America can focus on the real issue, which is China.”</p>
<p>“That’s the biggest threat to our country and we are completely
distracted from it,” said Vance, a staunch supporter of Trump’s Make
America Great Again agenda.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old author and venture capitalist rose to fame with his
2016 memoir “Hillbilly Elegy.” He advocates for a hands-off approach to
foreign policy and is dubious about military intervention.</p>
<p>Tariffs and more tariffs</p>
<p>Both Trump and Vance have supported strong tariffs on China. In an
interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation” news program in May, Vance said
the U.S. needs to apply across-the-board tariffs on imports.</p>
<p>“If you apply tariffs, really what it is you’re saying [is] that
we’re going to penalize you for using slave labor in China and importing
that stuff in the United States. What you end up doing is, you end up
making more stuff in America, in Pennsylvania, in Ohio and in Michigan,”
he said.</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly accused China of stealing manufacturing jobs
from the U.S., especially those jobs in the Midwestern part of the
country.</p>
<p>“Vance has supported more economic restrictions and tariffs on
Chinese imports and investments,” Dean Chen, a professor of political
science at the Ramapo College of New Jersey, told VOA. “Hence, I expect
his position on China to be in line with Trump nationalists in their
potential new administration.”</p>
<p>Trump has promised that, if elected, he would impose 10%
across-the-board levies on imported goods and a tariff of 60% or higher
on Chinese goods to protect American industries.</p>
<p>Joel Goldstein, professor emeritus of law at Saint Louis University
and an expert on the vice presidency, said Vance was selected because he
is “a very loyal supporter who has embraced Trump’s policies and style
and who seems disposed to defend Trump’s words and conduct.”</p>
<p>“The choice seems designed to appeal to Trump’s MAGA base, not to
unify the Republican Party or the nation,” he told VOA.</p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>Experts say Vance might be more of an isolationist than Trump, as
Vance was vehemently opposed to funding the war in Ukraine.</p>
<p>“He previously served as a U.S. Marine in Iraq and felt that the
lessons from that war should prevent future entanglements,” Chen
said.</p>
<p>Chen added that whether that attitude translates to lessened support
for a Taiwan military contingency remains to be seen.</p>
<p>“We all know that Trump has been clear that he won’t announce whether
he would send troops to help Taiwan should Beijing invade the island
democracy, saying that a lucid explanation would undercut his
negotiating position,” he said. “I expect Vance to toe the same line as
President Trump.”</p>
<p>Attracting Rust Belt voters</p>
<p>Vance was born on August 2, 1984, in Middletown, Ohio. He served in
the Marine Corps before attending The Ohio State University and Yale Law
School.</p>
<p>His 2016 bestselling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” detailed his family’s
struggles with poverty, addiction and instability. The book focuses on
the hardship faced by white working-class people in the Rust Belt — the
manufacturing region in the U.S. that includes parts of the Northeast
and Midwest and has experienced economic decline and population
loss.</p>
<p>“Senator Vance’s life story and diverse accomplishments are
impressive,” Karen Hult, a political science professor at Virginia Tech,
told VOA.</p>
<p>“He not only is from a ‘red’ Republican state, but one that is near
the battleground state of Pennsylvania and may be seen as appealing to
many more rural and smaller town residents in much of the Middle West,”
Hult said.</p>
<p>In the 2020 presidential election, Trump lost Pennsylvania, Wisconsin
and Michigan, three important swing states along the Rust Belt.</p>
<p>Hult said that in most presidential elections, the choice of running
mates makes little difference in voting results.</p>
<p>“That, of course, may differ in 2024, given the age of the two major
party candidates and in light of Saturday’s assassination attempt,” she
added.</p>

open to resuming nuclear accord talks, acting foreign minister says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Dubai, United Arab Emirates — Tehran remains open to resuming
negotiations with Washington on restoring their participation in a
nuclear agreement, Iran’s acting foreign minister told Newsweek magazine
in an interview published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ali Bagheri Kani’s remarks come as he prepares to address the United
Nations Security Council in New York.</p>
<p>The United States under President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018
from the nuclear accord between Iran and six world powers, which
restricted Tehran’s nuclear programs.</p>
<p>Indirect talks between the U.S. and Tehran to revive the deal have
stalled. Iran is still part of the agreement, but it has decreased its
commitments because of U.S. sanctions imposed on it.</p>
<p>Newsweek reported: “On the foreign policy front, he [Bagheri Kani]
said that Tehran remained open to resuming negotiations with Washington
toward restoring mutual participation in a nuclear deal.”</p>
<p>However, Iran also intended to foster its deepening ties with China,
Russia and neighboring nations, it quoted him as saying. Iran will also
call for greater action against Israel in view of the Gaza war, he
said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration said last week the United States was not
ready to resume nuclear talks with Iran under its new president.</p>
<p>Bagheri Kani became the acting foreign minister after foreign
minister Hossein Amirabdollahian died in a helicopter crash along with
Iran’s president Ebrahim Raisi in May.</p>
<p>Iranians then elected Masoud Pezeshkian as president, a moderate who
said he will promote a pragmatic foreign policy and ease tensions with
the powers involved in the 2015 nuclear pact.</p>

<h2 id="the-future-of-nuclear-fusion-is-clear-legally-at-least">The
Future of Nuclear Fusion Is Clear — Legally, At Least</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY4MzA3OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyOTIyNTIwN30.tnTjegiTOFA_F5paV4hQ07kLgVUsV1lrpCNc3QDKblA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
After decades of research and billions of dollars in funding, nuclear
fusion has produced “net energy” (more energy coming out of a reaction
than was necessary to start it) in exactly two places in our solar
system:
<a href="https://ww2.aip.org/fyi/2022/national-ignition-facility-achieves-long-sought-fusion-goal" target="_blank">Lawrence
Livermore National Lab</a>, and the sun. Even the scientists who did it
on Earth say that using the technology for real-world energy generation
is still a
“<a href="https://ww2.aip.org/fyi/2022/national-ignition-facility-achieves-long-sought-fusion-goal" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">very
distant</a>” prospect. <br/>
</p>
<p>
On the bright side, however, the <em>regulatory</em> path for fusion
energy has gotten a lot clearer. <br/> <br/> The
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_blank">ADVANCE
Act</a>, signed by President Biden last week, contained language that
will simplify the path to deployment for fusion, should it ever reach
commercialization. The Fusion Energy Act, contained within the ADVANCE
Act (which itself was stapled onto Fire Grants and Safety Act),
confirmed a decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2023
separating the regulatory apparatus for fusion and fission projects.
Fission — the only process used to produce nuclear energy commercially
today — can lead to runaway nuclear reactions and inevitably creates
radioactive waste, and going through the complex regulatory process can
take
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-certifies-first-us-small-modular-reactor-design" target="_blank">years</a>.
Fusion, by contrast, doesn’t have those risks. <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML2310/ML23103A449.pdf" target="_blank">In
a 2023 memo, the NRC approved its staff decision</a> to “to license and
regulate fusion energy systems under the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s
byproduct material framework,” i.e. the process used to approve things
like particle accelerators and medical applications. That change had
been prompted by an earlier nuclear bill, 2019’s Nuclear Energy
Innovation and Modernization Act.
</p>
<p>
Still, both lawmakers and the industry were wary that might not hold up
should the Supreme Court decide to overturn a
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-23-supreme-court" target="_self">decades-old
precedent</a> giving deference to agencies to interpret their own
mandates — a world “anybody who’s in Washington saw coming,” Andrew
Holland, head of the industry group Fusion Industry Association, told
me. “If there’s any ambiguity about what Congress said, then that
creates this regulatory uncertainty. So this is Congress saying,
<em>what the NRC did is what we wanted</em>.”
</p>
<p>
That is a big relief for fusion investors. “There was a lot of angst
among investors that, well, fusion is going to be regulated just like
nuclear fission,” Holland said, referring to the period before the NRC’s
decision in 2023. “So why shouldn’t I invest in the thing that I know
works, versus the thing that’s technologically hard?”
</p>
<p>
About that technology: Fusion is often described as the “holy grail” of
energy generation, both because of its immense promise (the fuel for
fusion
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsdeuterium-tritium-fusion-fuel#:~:text=Deuterium%20is%20common%3A%20about%201,about%202%2C400%20gallons%20of%20oil." target="_blank"><u>literally
comes from seawater</u></a>) with which it could generates immense
carbon free power without the waste and risks associated with fission
and because, like the grail, no one has been able to attain it.
</p>
<p>
Fusion has become something like
<a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137435354_8#:~:text=With%20more%20than%20a%20hint,endowed%20with%20enviable%20natural%20resources." target="_blank"><u>the
Brazil of energy research</u></a>, with a working reactor always 20 (or
30) years away. ITER, a giant international fusion project that has been
around in some form or another since the late 1970s, announced recently
that it had pushed back the timeline for starting its machine from 2025
to 2034.
</p>
<p>
<u></u>The private fusion industry, meanwhile, has raised over $7
billion in total, with about $6 billion coming since 2021, according to
Fusion Industry Association data. About
<a href="https://cfs.energy/news-and-media/commonwealth-fusion-systems-closes-1-8-billion-series-b-round" target="_blank">$2
billion of that</a> of that has gone to Commonwealth Fusion Systems,
which spun off from MIT in 2018.
</p>
<p>
The Massachusetts-based company is working on a fusion device that
<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/02/23/1045122/fusion-power-mit-startup-commonwealth/" target="_blank"><u>promises
to be</u></a> cheaper, faster, and easier to build that the unwieldy
ITER model. In 2021, Commonwealth and MIT researchers were able to
generate a magnetic field with a strength of 20 tesla,
<a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/MIT-CFS-major-advance-toward-fusion-energy-0908" target="_blank"><u>hailed
by researchers</u></a> as a meaningful step towards building a working
fusion device.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, however, many industry figures and researchers think
there’s more to be done on the funding side. The philanthropist John
Arnold
<a href="https://x.com/JohnArnoldFndtn/status/1812148559426343365" target="_blank">has
called for</a> explicit cost-sharing between the federal government and
fusion companies based on achieving technological milestones, where
fusion companies could certify that they achieved some kind of
pre-established technological or commercial breakthrough and thus unlock
government grants to defray their expenses. The Department of Energy has
a
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-46-million-commercial-fusion-energy-development" target="_blank"><u>program
to fund fusion companies</u></a> based on their achievements, but the
funding has been in the
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-46-million-commercial-fusion-energy-development" target="_blank"><u>tens
of millions</u></a>, which Arnold has described as “WAY TOO SMALL” and
“barely worth the company’s time spent on the application.”
<em><strong></strong></em>
</p>
<p>
This isn’t just idle musing by a philanthropist with a Twitter account:
Julien Barber, a climate investor at Emerson Collective, which has put
money into Commonwealth, tends to agree. “We’re not allocating enough
resources to actually make this a reality given the potential of it,” he
told me. “We have to make hard decisions about funding and allocation as
we move towards commercial fusion.”
</p>
<p>
<span></span>The ADVANCE Act’s cements fusion — and the nuclear industry
more broadly — as one of the favored energy technologies on Capitol
Hill. The bill also builds on legislation passed and signed during the
Trump administration and had the backing of a
<a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-fusion-energy-bill-critical-fire-grant-reauthorizations-pass-senate/" target="_blank"><u>bipartisan
group of senators</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
“Fusion energy is a promising clean and safe power source that could
help address America’s growing energy demands,” Senator John Cornyn,
Republican of Texas and one of the Fusion Energy Act’s co-sponsors, said
in a
<a href="https://www.padilla.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/padilla-fusion-energy-bill-critical-fire-grant-reauthorizations-pass-senate/" target="_blank">statement</a>
after the bill was passed. “This legislation will advance fusion
technology in pursuit of increased U.S. energy independence, and I am
grateful to my Senate colleagues for supporting it.”
</p>
<p>
“The Fusion Act is a pretty critical piece of what the fusion industry
has been working towards,” Barber said. “There are two big barriers
towards commercialization: We need enough funding to develop technology,
and we need to have regulatory pathways.”
</p>
<p>
Holland, of the Fusion Industry Association, is optimistic that whoever
is running Washington in 2025 will remain receptive to fusion — a
position will almost certainly not be the case for other forms of
non-carbon-emitting energy.
</p>
<p>
“You have Democrats who care because it’s the best form of renewable
energy, and Republicans who care because it’s an updated form of nuclear
energy,” he told me. “There’s been remarkably strong bipartisanship. And
I would expect that does not change in a new administration, whoever
leads the new administration.”

id="safari-already-contains-ad-tracking-technology-and-theyre-now-adding-it-to-safaris-private-browsing-mode-too">Safari
already contains ad tracking technology, and they’re now adding it to
Safari’s Private Browsing mode, too</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: OS News</p>
<p>We’ve been talking a lot about sleazy ways in which the online
advertising industry is conspiring with browser makers – who also happen
to be in the online advertising industry – to weaken privacy features so
they can still track you and the ads they serve you, but with “privacy”.
They’re trying really hard to make it seem as if they’re doing us a huge
favour by making tracking slightly more private, and browser makers are
falling over themselves to convince us that allowing some user and ad
tracking is the only way to stop the kind of total everything,
everywhere, all at once tracking we have now. We’ve got Google and
Chrome pushing something called “Privacy Sandbox“, and we’ve got Mozilla
and Facebook pushing something called “Privacy-Preserving Attribution“,
both of which are designed to give the advertising industry slightly
more private tracking in the desperate hope they won’t still be doing a
lot more tracking on the side. Safari users, meanwhile, have been
feeling pretty good about all of this in the knowledge Apple cares about
privacy, so surely Safari won’t be doing any of this. You know where
this is going, right? Today, the WebKit project published a lengthy blog
post detailing all the various additional measures it’s taking to make
its Private Browsing mode more, well, private, and a lot of them are
great moves, very welcome, and ensure that private browsing on Safari is
a little bit more private than it is on Chrome, as the blog post
gleefully points out. However, not long into the blog post, the shoe
drops. We also expanded Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click
Measurement) as a replacement for tracking parameters in URL to help
developers understand the performance of their marketing campaigns even
under Private Browsing. ↫ John Wilander, Charlie Wolfe, Matthew Finkel,
Wenson Hsieh, and Keith Holleman A little further down, they go into
more detail: Web AdAttributionKit (formerly Private Click Measurement)
is a way for advertisers, websites, and apps to implement ad attribution
and click measurement in a privacy-preserving way. You can read more
about it here. Alongside the new suite of enhanced privacy protections
in Private Browsing, Safari also brings a version of Web
AdAttributionKit to Private Browsing. This allows click measurement and
attribution to continue working in a privacy-preserving manner. ↫ John
Wilander, Charlie Wolfe, Matthew Finkel, Wenson Hsieh, and Keith
Holleman So not only does Safari already include the kind of tracking
technology everyone is – rightfully – attacking Mozilla over for adding
it to Firefox, Apple and the Safari team are actually taking it a step
further and making this ad tracking technology available in private
browsing mode. The technology is limited a bit more in Private Browsing
mode, but its intent is preserved: to track you and the ads you see
online. I would hazard a guess that when you enable a browser’s private
browsing or incognito mode, you assume that means zero tracking. We
already know that Chrome’s Incognito mode leaks data like a sieve with
bullet holes in it, and now it seems Safari’s Private Browsing mode,
too, is going to allow advertisers to track you and the ads you see –
blog post full of fancy privacy features be damned. Do you know those
“Around the web” chumboxes? Even if you’re unfamiliar with the term,
you’ve most definitely seen these things all over the web, and really
hate them. A major player in the chumbox business is a company called
Taboola, a name that’s quite despised and reviled online. Popular Apple
blogger John Gruber called Taboola a “slumlord” and the “lowest common
denominator clickbait property“. Do you want to know which major
technology company just signed a massive deal with Taboola? Ad tech
giant Taboola has struck a deal with Apple to power native advertising
within the Apple News and Apple Stocks apps, Taboola founder and CEO
Adam Singolda told Axios. ↫ Sara Fischer at Axios Apple needs to find
new markets to keep growing, and clearly, pestering its users with
upsells and subscriptions to its services isn’t enough. The online
advertising industry is massive – just look at Google’s and Facebook’s
financial disclosures – and Apple seems to be interested in taking a
bigger slice of that fat pie. And as Google and now Mozilla are finding
out, a browser that blocks ads and ad tracking kind of gets in the way
of that. Anyone who can make and sell plug-and-play Pi-Hole devices even
normal people can use is going to make a killing.</p>

<h2 id="wind-is-more-powerful-than-j.-d.-vance-seems-to-think">Wind Is
More Powerful Than J. D. Vance Seems to Think</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjgxNTcyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2NzE2ODY3MH0.HECkh5vg6nNF1KdLXxDnWEuDWnPTxfUaCGQtvDGHZ6o/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
It’s a good thing most of us aren’t accountable for every single silly
thing we’ve ever said, but most of us are not vice presidential running
mates, either. Back in 2022, when J.D. Vance was still just a
“<em><em>New York Times</em></em> bestselling author” and not yet a
“junior senator from Ohio,” much less “second-in-line to a former
president who will turn 80 in office if he’s reelected,” he made a
climate oopsie that — now that
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/climate/jd-vance-climate-change.html#:~:text=Referring%20to%20environmentalists,a%20cellphone%20on%3F%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">it’s
recirculating</a> — deserves to be addressed.
</p>
<p>
If Democrats “care so much about climate change,” Vance argued during an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/LrBGXUIhdog?feature=shared&t=7733" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ohio
Republican senator candidate forum</u></a> during that year, “and they
think climate change is caused by carbon emissions, then why is their
solution to scream about it at the top of their lungs, send a bunch of
our jobs to China, and then manufacture these ridiculous ugly windmills
all over Ohio farms that don’t produce enough electricity to run a cell
phone?”
</p>
<p>
Vance is hardly the first person to get confused about intermittent
energy sources such as wind; his new would-be boss, former President
Donald Trump, likes to claim that wind turbines can’t even power a
single household’s television. The fallacy stems from the idea that the
power will “go out” if the wind isn’t blowing — which, in theory, would
be true in <em><em>any</em></em> case where power demand outpaces
supply. But grids are regulated with
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-what-will-a-net-zero-grid-energy-mix-actually-look-like" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>levels
of redundancy</u></a> specifically designed to prevent those sorts of
outages, Kyri Baker, an assistant professor of engineering at the
University of Colorado,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-wind-solar-fact-check#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRemember%20the%20windmills%3F" target="_self"><u>previously
explained to me</u></a>. There are also, of course,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/battery-hydrostor-nostromo-energy-vault" target="_self"><u>batteries</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Still, for the sake of argument: If the wind is blowing, could a turbine
“produce enough electricity to run a cell phone”? Even running at 42%
capacity —
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-homes-can-average-wind-turbine-power#:~:text=At%20a%2042%25%20capacity%20factor,than%20940%20average%20U.S.%20homes." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>typical
for turbines</u></a> circa when Vance was speaking — the average turbine
in the U.S. generates roughly 1,170 kilowatt-hours of electricity in 60
minutes, according to the
<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-many-homes-can-average-wind-turbine-power#:~:text=At%20a%2042%25%20capacity%20factor,than%20940%20average%20U.S.%20homes." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>United
States Geological Survey</u></a>. Charging your phone twice daily for
365 days
<a href="https://www.energysage.com/electricity/house-watts/how-many-watts-does-a-phone-charger-use/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>amounts
to less than</u></a> 3.7 kilowatt-hours per <em><em>year</em></em>. In
other words, about the time it takes to watch an episode of
<em><em>Bridgerton</em></em>, a single wind turbine can generate enough
electricity to charge 316 phones each day twice over. So Vance is
<em><em>way</em></em> off here.
</p>
<p>
Are the windmills “ridiculous” and “ugly”? That’s more subjective, but
they’re certainly not being built “all over Ohio farms.” Wind makes up
<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/environment/2020/07/06/wind-farm-to-tower-over-northwest-ohio-countryside/42083191/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>less
than 2%</u></a> of the electricity generated in Ohio, and despite the
Buckeye State being
<a href="https://www.cleveland.com/metro/2011/08/charles_brush_used_wind_power.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one
of the birthplaces of wind power</u></a>, it only has about
<a href="https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/environment/2020/07/06/wind-farm-to-tower-over-northwest-ohio-countryside/42083191/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>419
windmills</u></a> online, placing it 24th out of all the states. Strict
laws in Ohio enacted in 2014 have
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/volatile-place-new-laws-thwart-ohio-renewables/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>all
but halted</u></a> new wind turbines from being built.
</p>
<p>
Vance is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/jd-vance-vp-esg" target="_self"><u>an
oil and gas guy</u></a>, so maybe his ignorance of wind power can be
politely overlooked this one time. But going forward, when campaigning
and potentially working at a national level, it’ll be important for him
to get his facts straight. Wind is the largest source of renewable
electricity in the United States. It’s charging <em><em>a lot</em></em>
of cell phones.
</p>
<p>
<em>Editor’s note: This story has been updated to correct the number of
cell phones a single wind turbine could charge twice each day for a
year. It is 316, not 244. </em><br/>

id="us-latin-american-grouping-aims-to-confront-economic-problems">US,
Latin American grouping aims to confront economic problems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The problems of rising poverty and decreasing
productivity in Latin America will be on the agenda when the foreign
ministers of 12 regional countries convene in Washington on Wednesday, a
U.S. State Department official said. </p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken aims during the talks to “tackle”
those challenges and work toward making the Americas “the world’s most
economically competitive region,” said Brian Nichols, assistant
secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs. </p>
<p>The ministers represent members of the Americas Partnership for
Economic Prosperity, established two years ago to “achieve concrete
results for the middle class, workers, and historically marginalized
groups” by deepening economic integration and creating good paying jobs,
Nichols said, speaking at a briefing this week. </p>
<p>“Through this partnership, we will work together to build resilient
supply chains, reinvigorate our region’s economic institutions, and
invest in our workers, our infrastructure, and our strategic industries
– whether through semiconductors or clean energy, or medical supplies or
the critical minerals needed for our modern economy.” </p>
<p>Nichols pointed out that the United States is Latin America’s largest
trading partner and its largest source of foreign direct investment. In
2023, U.S. trade with Latin America and the Caribbean totaled over $1.1
trillion, and Mexico displaced China as America’s top trading
partner.  </p>
<p>Nevertheless, he said “poverty rates are rising in Latin America,
productivity has lagged, and income inequality remains a serious
problem. The pandemic demonstrated to us and to our regional partners
the importance of developing more diversified and reliable supply chains
closer to home.” </p>
<p>Lisa Kubiske, a former U.S. ambassador to Honduras and former deputy
assistant secretary of state, said that in the past two years, the
member nations have been able to close gaps in their free trade
agreements and address structural issues that thwart broad-based
economic growth. </p>
<p>At a summit in November, she said, the leaders of the 12 countries
directed their ministers to develop three tracks: trade, finance and
foreign affairs. On the foreign affairs front, the group has engaged “on
clean hydrogen, entrepreneurship, rule of law and transparency, smart
agriculture, peaceful uses of space” and other issues, she told
journalists at a briefing.  </p>
<p>The president of the Inter-American Development Bank and the deputy
CEO of the Development Finance Corporation have been invited to a lunch
with the ministers. There will also be two side events, one hosted by
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and another hosted by the Council of the
Americas. </p>
<p>The founding members of the group are Barbados, Canada, Chile, Costa
Rica, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru,
the United States, and Uruguay. Their leaders will meet again next year
in Costa Rica.</p>

returns to campaign trail with speech to Black voters</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — All eyes will be on Joe Biden as he addresses Black
supporters Tuesday in the battleground state of Nevada, his first
campaign appearance since the assassination attempt on his Republican
rival, former president Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The U.S. president is expected to sharpen the choice voters will face
this November, while calling for unity amid concerns of escalating
political violence in the country.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, at a convention of an American civil rights
organization, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, or NAACP, Biden will highlight his administration’s support for
Black voters who have been part of the backbone of the Democratic
party’s coalition.</p>
<p>He is set to unveil policies to rein in rising housing costs, a
critical issue in Nevada. He’ll broadcast his message in an interview
with Black Entertainment Television, BET, later the same day.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, he’ll address UnidosUS, the nation’s largest Hispanic
civil rights and advocacy organization, attempting to win Latino voters,
another key voting bloc for Democrats.</p>
<p>In both events, Biden is expected to repeat his calls to cool down
the country’s political rhetoric, a message he has delivered in three
remarks in less than 24 hours following the shooting at Trump’s
Pennsylvania campaign event that killed a rallygoer and wounded others,
including the former president.</p>
<p>“Disagreement is inevitable in American democracy,” the president
said in a rare Oval Office address Sunday. “But politics must never be a
literal battlefield, and, God forbid, a killing field.”</p>
<p>Biden faces the challenge of navigating his unity message with his
vows to stop Trump at all costs, as his campaign adjusts its strategy to
move forward amid the president’s declining poll numbers. The Biden team
had just begun to more sharply criticize Trump in an effort to stabilize
Biden’s candidacy, following his rocky debate performance last month
when the shooting occurred.</p>
<p>Via his social media platform, Trump urged the nation to “stand
united.” He said in an interview with the Washington Examiner newspaper
that he rewrote his speech for this week’s Republican National
Convention to focus more on unity following the attempt on his life.</p>
<p>“I fear that this moment of detente won’t last very long,” said
Claire Finkelstein, director of the Center for Ethics and the Rule of
Law at the University of Pennsylvania. But it may bring greater
awareness from each candidate to refrain from rhetoric that “can have an
impact” especially on followers “who can be easily revved up into
engaging in acts of violence,” she told VOA.</p>
<p>Biden continues to reject calls from at least 20 congressional
Democrats and others within his party to step aside over concerns about
his age and mental acuity, insisting that he is the best-positioned
Democrat to beat Trump.</p>
<p>The latest polling data averages from various surveys compiled by
FiveThirtyEight shows that Trump is leading by 4.7 percent in
Nevada.</p>

<p>The weekend assassination attempt on Donald Trump has silenced much
of the chatter over President Joe Biden’s political future. But as Trump
charged forward Monday, appearing at the Republican National Convention
and naming his vice presidential pick, the Biden administration prepared
for a Tuesday campaign stop in this uncertain stage in the presidential
race. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House.</p>

National political conventions don’t make for the best TV. Prime-time
speeches are delivered by a parade of party celebrities and last for
only a few minutes — typically just enough time to bash gas prices
(<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/15/fact-check-republican-national-convention-day-1/#:~:text=This%20statement%20lacks%20context." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>nonsensically</u></a>)
and get in a few digs at the opposition. The highlight of the Republican
National Convention’s broadcast out of Milwaukee on Monday night was, in
fact, entirely wordless: former President Donald Trump’s walk across the
floor with a conspicuous white bandage over his ear.
</p>
<p>
The only words that really mattered on Monday were
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/15/republican-party-platform-trum-abortion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reviewed
and approved behind closed doors</u></a>. “It’s a different kind of
platform,” Tennessee Senator and Chair of the Committee on the Platform
Marsha Blackburn said by way of introduction during her speech yesterday
evening. Reviewing how the 2024 Republican Party Platform’s energy
sections compare to the ones in 2016 (the GOP
<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/24/21399396/republican-convention-platform-2020-2016" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>did
not write a new platform</u></a> for its convention in 2020), it’s clear
how true that actually is.
</p>
<p>
Eight years ago,
<a href="https://prod-cdn-static.gop.com/media/documents/DRAFT_12_FINAL%5B1%5D-ben_1468872234.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Republican platform</u></a> included “Agriculture, Energy, and the
Environment” among its six chapters, describing goals such as “expedited
siting processes” for transmission lines; better forest management to
prevent wildfires; the “development of all forms of energy that are
marketable in a free economy without subsidies, including coal, oil,
natural gas, nuclear power, and hydropower” and renewable sources like
wind and solar by “private capital”; as well as the rejection of “the
agendas of both the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement.” The goals
were reasonably detailed, at least enough so that the 2016 platform ran
a full 50 pages longer than the 2024 version. (Trump, of course, has
little

for the written word</u></a>.)
</p>
<p>
The
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/64ab29f5-f8b7-4478-97e7-7afa84727e60.pdf?itid=lk_inline_enhanced-template#toolbar=0&navpanes=0#scrollbar=0&itid=lk_inline_manual_20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2024
Republican platform</u></a> gets to its point much more quickly
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/15/republican-party-platform-trum-abortion/#:~:text=limit%20opponents%E2%80%99%20ability%20to%20use%20the%20language%20against%20them" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>by
design</u></a>. “MAKE AMERICA THE DOMINANT ENERGY PRODUCER IN THE WORLD,
BY FAR!” is fourth on the priority list. That’s an easy enough goal
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-oil-gas-fact-check#:~:text=the%20United%20States%20is%20the%20top%20oil%2Dproducing%20country" target="_self"><u>since
the U.S. is </u><u><em><em>already</em></em></u></a> the world’s
dominant energy producer, at least in oil and natural gas, the favored
fuels of both
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-47-committee-big-oil" target="_self"><u>Trump</u></a>
and
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/j-d-vances-energy-record-oil-cash-and-ev-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Vance</u></a>.
The platform further promises to “DRILL, BABY, DRILL” its way to the
U.S. becoming “Energy Independent and even Dominant again” — another
easy goal since the country is
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-oil-gas-fact-check#:~:text=%E2%80%9COn%20January%206%2C%20we%20were%20energy%20independent.%E2%80%9D%20%5BJune%2027%2C%202024%5D" target="_self"><u>already
energy independent</u></a> by multiple definitions. Coal, until recently
a staple Republican talking point, gets
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/coal-2024-election-trump-biden" target="_self"><u>just
one</u></a> blink-and-you’ll-miss-it reference.
</p>
<p>
The platform offers no specific plan for improving on President Biden’s
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/business/us-production-oil-reserves-crude/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>record
oil and gas production numbers</u></a>. It <em><em>does</em></em>,
however, state that the party will ensure “Reliable and Abundant Low
Cost Energy,” a statement that, by omission, implies the party will do
so without the same level of all-caps enthusiasm for
<em><em>electrification</em></em>. This will be quite a feat as the
renewable cost curve continues to
<a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/charts-renewables-are-on-track-to-keep-getting-cheaper-and-cheaper#:~:text=Renewable%20energy%20already%20beats%20fossil,clean%20energy%20think%20tank%20RMI." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>trend
down</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Also new to the platform in 2024 is hostility toward electric vehicles,
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-electric-vehicles-fact-check" target="_self"><u>a
favorite talking point of Trump’s</u></a> on the campaign trail and a
longtime punching bag of Vance’s. The party claims that it can “Save the
American Auto Industry” by “reversing harmful Regulations, canceling
Biden’s Electric Vehicle and other Mandates, and preventing the
importation of Chinese vehicles.” Given that there
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/28/us/politics/trump-fact-check-electric-vehicles.html#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20federal%20electric%20vehicle%20mandate" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>isn’t
actually an EV mandate</u></a>, that sounds pretty much “exactly like
what Democrats want,” the economic columnist Noah Smith wrote in his
recent
<a href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/lets-evaluate-the-whole-republican?r=b7n&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>breakdown
of the platform</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, alongside other pressingly important issues to the American
public like making Washington, D.C., “the most beautiful capital city,”
the 2024 Republican platform gestures toward restoring “genuine
Conservation efforts.” Such a promise, buried at the end of the
document, rings especially hollow given that Trump oversaw
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/health/protected-land-conservation-study/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
largest reduction of protected land</u></a> in U.S. history.
</p>
<p>
Of course, shabby promises are to be expected. Party platforms are
non-binding and, as Smith also points out, they reveal far more about
who Republicans are appealing to,
<a href="https://msmagazine.com/2024/07/12/republican-trump-position-abortion/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>and
how</u></a>, than what they
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-climate-change-project-2025" target="_self"><u>actually
plan to do once they’re in power</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
The pared-down energy and climate sections in the 2024 platform don’t
necessarily mean Trump will keep
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-climate-legacy" target="_self"><u>Biden-era
policies</u></a> largely intact, then. If anything, they simply leave
more room for Trump to do whatever he wants if — or
<a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>when?</u></a>
— he wins back the White House.

“the region’s outsized vastness and ecological value” should be

restricted new oil and gas leasing on 13 million acres of the reserve,
and will soon invite the public to weigh in on whether more land should
be protected. The Trump administration opened most of the reserve to
fossil fuel exploration efforts in 2020, but Biden reversed that move in

<h2 id="the-dream-of-247-clean-electricity-gets-a-funding-boost">The
Dream of 24/7 Clean Electricity Gets a Funding Boost</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjY4NDMwMi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODY3NTM0M30.am5RQVjGVPAJHXxY3RJx1l6zoOJmDplm83_I9hs10OI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p>
The United Nations calls
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/24-7-clean-energy-hydrogen" target="_self"><u>24/7
carbon-free energy generation</u></a>, also known as hourly matching,
“<a href="https://www.un.org/en/energy-compacts/page/compact-247-carbon-free-energy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>t</u><u>he
end state</u></a> of a fully decarbonized electricity system.” It means
that every kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed is matched with a
zero-emissions electricity source, every hour of every day. It’s
something that Google and Microsoft are aiming to implement by 2030, and
it represents a much more significant climate commitment than today’s
default system of annualized matching
</p>
<p>
So here’s a positive sign: LevelTen Energy, the leading marketplace for
power purchase agreements, just raised $65 million in Series D funding,
led by the investment firm B Capital with participation from Microsoft,
Google, and Prelude Ventures, among others.
</p>
<p>
The money will help support LevelTen’s work with the
<a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/alliance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Granular
Certificate Trading Alliance</u></a>, a collaboration it started last
December in partnership with the Intercontinental Exchange, a data firm
that operates global financial marketplaces. Together they’re building a
platform for trading and managing “granular certificates,”
hourly-matched energy certificates that will help corporations — and
ideally the electricity sector at large — move to 24/7 hourly matching.
Other partners to the alliance include Google, Microsoft, and the energy
companies AES and Constellation.
</p>
<p>
To date, LevelTen has facilitated over $15.8 billion in power purchase
agreements, asset sales, and other clean energy transactions, totaling
over 7 gigawatts of clean energy. Overall, the company has raised more
than $125 million, with past investors including the My Climate Journey
Collective as well as the investment arms of oil and gas companies such
as
<a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/post/series-c-funding" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Equinor
and TotalEnergies</u></a>, which are adding renewables to their
portfolios.
</p>
<p>
Bryce Smith, LevelTen’s founder and CEO, told me the platform will
launch its first auctions for hourly-matched clean energy by the end of
the year, with initial customers expected to be corporate partners like
Google and Microsoft themselves.
</p>
<p>
“Corporates have been leading the way in a lot of respects and they’re
doing it again on the granular certificate front,” Smith said. He sees
it as LevelTen’s job to get more industry players onboard by creating
the transaction infrastructure to enable hourly matching. “So there’s a
bit of a ‘build it and they will come’ aspect to this,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
Realistically, though, it’s unlikely that the electricity industry will
move towards 24/7 clean energy absent some serious incentives to do so.
That’s why the Biden administration’s proposed
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>hydrogen
tax credit rules</u></a> could be so powerful. They stipulate that to
qualify for the largest IRA subsidies, clean hydrogen must be produced
using a relatively new source of carbon-free electricity, generated
within the <em><em>same hour</em></em> that it’s used and in roughly the
same location. If these regulations aren’t deleted or seriously altered
by this or another new administration
(<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/hydrogen-tax-credit-rules" target="_self"><u>which
they probably will be</u></a>), power grids would have until 2028 to set
up new systems for hourly accounting, thereby laying the groundwork for
24/7 matching across the electricity sector at large.
</p>
<p>
That potential, tenuous and unlikely though it may be, has LevelTen
excited, and the company is leaning hard into hydrogen. LevelTen is a
founding member of
<a href="https://h2di.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Hydrogen Demand Initiative</u></a>, a coalition formed by the Department
of Energy to ensure that the clean hydrogen produced by the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hydrogen-hubs-biden-pennsylvania-california-texas" target="_self"><u>seven
designated hydrogen hubs</u></a> is actually sold. The DOE is allocating
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-jumpstart-clean-hydrogen-economy-new-initiative-provide-market" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$1
billion to help catalyze demand</u></a>, and it’s up to H2DI to figure
out how to distribute that. “A component of that is figuring out how to
bring buyers and sellers together easily and smoothly,” Smith told me.
“And that’s the role that we play in creating a marketplace where buyers
and sellers can find each other and execute.”
</p>
<p>
Smith is aware that a change in administration could very well mean
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/hydrogen-rule-biden-clean-energy" target="_self"><u>a
change in the hydrogen tax credit rules</u></a>, potentially decreasing
incentives for green hydrogen and making hydrogen produced from natural
gas with carbon capture and storage (“blue hydrogen”) or hydrogen
produced without CCS (“gray hydrogen”) more attractive. He said the
LevelTen platform would likely support transactions that involve a
“variety of hydrogen colors and technologies.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s most important for us always is figuring out how to put a vital
technology on the fastest track to scaling,” Smith told me. “And if that
means accommodating different colors for some period of time, we have
the end goal [of green hydrogen] always in mind.”
</p>
<p>
As LevelTen scales, it’s also working to get more utilities onto its
platform. Smith told me that utility customers have, “really only fairly
recently realized that their procurement needs around renewables are
massive.”<em> </em>As the push to “electrify everything” gains momentum
and data centers suck up more and more power, utilities are increasingly
investing in renewable energy to meet their electricity needs, diversify
their portfolios and respond to customer demand for clean power. “We’re
used to seeing really slow, fairly predictable demand and electricity
growth from a utility perspective, and that’s changing pretty
dramatically,” Smith told me.
</p>
<p>
LevelTen currently operates in 29 countries across North America and
Europe, and hopes to use its recent funding to expand into new regions.

Trump enters Republican convention hall with a bandaged ear and gets a
hero’s welcome</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Milwaukee — Two days after surviving an attempted assassination,
former President Donald Trump appeared triumphantly at the Republican
National Convention’s opening night with a bandage over his right ear,
the latest compelling scene in a presidential campaign already defined
by dramatic turns.</p>
<p>Delegates cheered wildly when Trump appeared onscreen backstage and
then emerged in the arena, visibly emotional, as musician Lee Greenwood
sang “God Bless the USA.” That was hours after the convention had
formally nominated the former president to head the Republican ticket in
November against President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Trump, accompanied by a wall of Secret Service agents, did not
address the hall — with his acceptance speech scheduled for Thursday —
but smiled silently and occasionally waved as Greenwood sang. He
eventually joined his newly announced running mate, Ohio Sen. J.D.
Vance, to listen to the night’s remaining speeches, often with a subdued
expression and muted reactions uncharacteristic for the unabashed
showman.</p>
<p>The raucous welcome underscored the depth of the crowd’s affection
for the man who won the 2016 nomination as an outsider, at odds with the
party establishment, but has vanquished all Republican rivals, silenced
most conservative critics and now commands loyalty up and down the party
ranks.</p>
<p>“We must unite as a party, and we must unite as a nation,” said
Republican Party Chairman Michael Whatley, Trump’s handpicked party
leader, as he opened Monday’s prime-time national convention session.
“We must show the same strength and resilience as President Trump and
lead this nation to a greater future.”</p>
<p>But Whatley and other Republican leaders made clear that their calls
for harmony did not extend to Biden and Democrats, who find themselves
still riven by worries that the 81-year-old question is not up to the
job of defeating Trump.</p>
<p>“Their policies are a clear and present danger to America, to our
institutions, our values and our people,” said Wisconsin Sen. Ron
Johnson, welcoming the party to his battleground state, which Trump won
in 2016 but lost to Biden four years ago.</p>
<p>Saturday’s shooting at a Pennsylvania rally, where Trump was injured
and one man died, were clearly in mind, but the proceedings were
celebratory — a stark contrast to the anger and anxiety that had marked
the previous few days. Some delegates chanted “fight, fight, fight” —
the same words that Trump was seen shouting to the crowd Saturday as the
Secret Service ushered him off the stage, his fist raised and face
bloodied.</p>
<p>“We should all be thankful right now that we are able to cast our
votes for President Donald J. Trump after what took place on Saturday,”
said New Jersey state Sen. Michael Testa as he announced all of his
state’s 12 delegates for Trump.</p>
<p>When Trump cleared the necessary number of delegates, video screens
in the arena read “OVER THE TOP” while the song “Celebration” played and
delegates danced and waved Trump signs. Throughout the voting, delegates
flanked by “Make America Great Again” signs applauded as state after
state voted their support for a second Trump term.</p>
<p>Multiple speakers invoked religious imagery to discuss Trump and the
assassination attempt.</p>
<p>“The devil came to Pennsylvania holding a rifle,” said Sen. Tim Scott
of South Carolina. “But an American lion got back up on his feet!”</p>
<p>Wyoming delegate Sheryl Foland was among those who adopted the
“fight” chant after seeing Trump survive Saturday in what she called
“monumental photos and video.”</p>
<p>“We knew then we were going to adopt that as our chant,” added
Foland, a child trauma mental health counselor. “Not just because we
wanted him to fight, and that God was fighting for him. We thought,
isn’t it our job to accept that challenge and fight for our
country?”</p>
<p>“It’s bigger than Trump,” Foland said. “It’s a mantra for our
country.”</p>
<p>Another well-timed development boosted the mood on the convention
floor Monday: The federal judge presiding over Trump’s classified
documents case dismissed the prosecution because of concerns over the
appointment of the prosecutor who brought the case, handing the former
president a major court victory.</p>
<p>The convention is designed to reach people outside the GOP base</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign chiefs designed the convention to feature a softer
and more optimistic message, focusing on themes that would help a
divisive leader expand his appeal among moderate voters and people of
color.</p>
<p>On a night devoted to the economy, delegates and a national TV
audience heard from speakers the Trump campaign pitched as “everyday
Americans” — a single mother talking about inflation, a union member who
identified himself as a lifelong Democrat now backing Trump, a
small-business owner, among others.</p>
<p>Featured speakers also included Black Republicans who have been at
the forefront of the Trump campaign’s effort to win more votes from a
core Democratic constituency.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas said rising grocery and energy prices
were hurting Americans’ wallets and quoted Ronald Reagan in calling
inflation “the cruelest tax on the poor.” Hunt argued Biden and Vice
President Kamala Harris didn’t seem to understand the problem.</p>
<p>“We can fix this disaster,” Hunt said, by electing Trump and sending
“him right back to where he belongs, the White House.”</p>
<p>Scott, perhaps the party’s most well-known Black lawmaker, declared,
“America is not a racist country.”</p>
<p>Republicans hailed Vance’s selection as a key step toward a winning
coalition in November.</p>
<p>Trump announced his choice of his running mate as delegates were
voting on the former president’s nomination Monday. The young Ohio
senator first rose to national attention with his bestselling memoir,
“Hillbilly Elegy,” which told of his Appalachian upbringing and was
hailed as a window into the parts of working-class America that helped
propel Trump.</p>
<p>North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who had been considered a potential
vice presidential pick, said in a post on X that Vance’s “small town
roots and service to country make him a powerful voice for the America
First Agenda.”</p>
<p>Yet despite calls for harmony, two of the opening speakers at
Monday’s evening session — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and
North Carolina gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson — are known as some
of the party’s most incendiary figures.</p>
<p>Robinson, speaking recently during a church service in North
Carolina, discussed “evil” people who he said threatened American
Christianity. “Some folks need killing,” he said then, though he steered
clear of such rhetoric on the convention stage.</p>
<p>Opening night also did not pass without references to the 2020
election and Trump’s repeated lies that it was stolen from him.</p>
<p>Trump’s nomination came on the same day that Biden sat for another
national TV interview as the president sought to demonstrate his
capacity to serve another four years despite continued worries within
his own party.</p>
<p>Biden told ABC News that he made a mistake recently when he told
Democratic donors the party must stop questioning his fitness for office
and instead put Trump in a “bull’s-eye.” Republicans have circulated the
comment aggressively since Saturday’s assassination attempt, with some
openly blaming Biden for inciting the attack on Trump’s life.</p>
<p>The president’s admission was in line with his call Sunday from the
Oval Office for all Americans to ratchet down political rhetoric. But
Biden maintained Monday that drawing contrasts with Trump, who employs
harsh and accusatory language, is a legitimate part of a presidential
contest.</p>
<p>Inside the arena in Milwaukee, Republicans did not dial back their
attacks on Biden, at one point playing a video that mocked the
president’s physical stamina and mental acuity.</p>
<p>They alluded often to the “Biden-Harris administration” and took
regular digs at Vice President Kamala Harris — a not-so-subtle allusion
to the notion that Biden could step aside in favor of his
second-in-command.</p>

<h2
id="biden-trump-call-for-unity-in-aftermath-of-trump-assassination-attempt-1">Biden,
Trump call for unity in aftermath of Trump assassination attempt</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>The White House — President Joe Biden and former President Donald
Trump on Monday made high-profile appearances, each man acknowledging in
his own way how the weekend assassination attempt against Trump has
reshaped both of their presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>Trump briefly appeared on stage at the Republican National Convention
late Monday, a white bandage taped over his right ear where a bullet
clipped him Saturday as he addressed a Pennsylvania rally. On Monday,
the Biden administration announced a separate, independent investigation
into the shooting, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation leads the main
inquiry.</p>
<p>The stark differences between the two main presidential campaigns
were further illuminated Monday, with Trump not uttering a word but
entering the Milwaukee stadium to rapturous applause and a standing,
cheering ovation sustained for the length of a very, very extended
version of Trump’s signature campaign song, “God Bless the U.S.A.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Biden spoke in cool, measured tones to NBC’s Lester Holt,
saying that he still deeply disagrees with Trump, and with the
“inflammatory” and “vicious” way Trump and his base communicate their
grievances.</p>
<p>And asked whether he thought the shooting would change the trajectory
of the presidential race:</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he replied. “You don’t either.”</p>
<p>But the weekend’s events seem to have resolved the last political
cliffhanger – the national debate over whether Biden’s poor, stumbling
June debate performance against Trump meant he should step aside.</p>
<p>“I expect that Joe Biden has weathered the storm and this question
about whether he should drop out is mostly in the rearview mirror,” said
Jim Kessler, executive vice president for think tank Third Way. “But he
needs to perform well.”</p>
<p>Biden, in the lengthy interview held at the White House after he
canceled a planned Monday trip to Austin, aimed to distinguish himself
from his rival in stark terms.</p>
<p>“Look, I’m not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one,”
he said. “I’m not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the
election. I’m not the guy who said that he wouldn’t accept the outcome
of this election.”</p>
<p>Both men have called for unity in the wake of Trump’s shooting.</p>
<p>But analysts say that word may not mean what you think it means.</p>
<p>“They’re both calling for unity,” said John Geer, a distinguished
professor of political science at Vanderbilt University. “But I think
their differences in the kind of concept are fundamental. And that’s
where the, I think the problem is going to break down. And so they’re
calling for it, but, in fact, it may well be partisanship in
disguise.”</p>
<p>And the political divide between Americans is so bitter that advocacy
groups are warning that it’s not just the candidates who need to cool it
– voters need to do so as well.</p>
<p>“Stay passionate about the causes you care about and remain engaged,”
said Will Fuller, of Pennsylvania-based Common Ground USA, in guidance
sent to journalists Monday. “We face significant challenges that require
us to fulfill the promise of opportunity for all Americans. But in that
work, it’s essential to distinguish between advocating for our beliefs
and fighting against each other.”</p>

id="baltimore-officials-sue-to-block-baby-bonus-initiative-that-would-give-new-parents-1000">Baltimore
officials sue to block ‘baby bonus’ initiative that would give new
parents $1,000</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — Baltimore’s mayor and city council have filed a lawsuit
seeking to stop a proposal that would let voters decide whether to give
all new parents a one-time $1,000 “baby bonus” meant to help alleviate
childhood poverty from birth.</p>
<p>The complaint was filed Thursday, according to online court records.
It came not long after organizers secured the necessary 10,000
signatures to bring the question to voters as a ballot initiative in
November.</p>
<p>City leaders argue that the proposal is unconstitutional and should
be blocked from the ballot because it would give voters too much say
over legislative decisions, effectively “usurping those powers” from
their elected officials.</p>
<p>An estimated 7,000 children are born in Baltimore each year, so the
program would cost about $7 million annually. That amounts to roughly
0.16% of the city’s annual operating budget, according to supporters. It
wouldn’t result in higher taxes, but it would be up to the city council
to allocate the necessary funds.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that the charter amendment process is meant to
address changes to the form and structure of government, not specific
legislative or budgetary questions.</p>
<p>But supporters of the baby bonus say the lawsuit is a political power
grab.</p>
<p>“We are fully confident the courts will reject this attack on
democracy,” the Maryland Child Alliance said in a statement posted to
social media last week. The group was founded by Baltimore teachers
advocating for legislation to alleviate child poverty.</p>
<p>They say more systemic change is needed on a national level to help
lift families out of poverty, but giving new parents a modest financial
boost could prove an important first step.</p>
<p>The proposal is loosely modeled on a program implemented this year in
Flint, Michigan, where women receive $1,500 during mid-pregnancy and
$500 per month for the first year after giving birth. Officials said the
Flint program was the first of its kind in the U.S. Countries in Europe
and Asia have experimented with larger cash payments, but those programs
are meant to encourage people to have more kids, not address child
poverty.</p>
<p>Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott’s administration, which launched a
guaranteed income pilot program targeting young single parents in 2022,
said in a statement that he’s “supportive of the proposed amendment’s
objectives” even though he wants it off the ballot.</p>

arrests plunge 29% in June to the lowest of Biden’s presidency</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico
plunged 29% in June, the lowest month of Joe Biden’s presidency,
according to figures released Monday that provide another window on the
impact of a new rule to temporarily suspend asylum.</p>
<p>Arrests totaled 83,536 in June, down from 117,901 in May to mark the
lowest tally since January 2021, U.S. Customs and Border Protection
said.</p>
<p>A seven-day average of daily arrests fell more than half by the end
of June from Biden’s announcement on June 4 that asylum processing would
be halted when daily arrests reach 2,500, which they did immediately,
said Troy Miller, acting Customs and Border Protection commissioner.</p>
<p>“Recent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our
ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully,” Miller
said.</p>
<p>Arrests had already fallen by more than half from a record high of
250,000 in December, largely a result of increased enforcement by
Mexican authorities, according to U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Sharp declines registered across nationalities, including Mexicans,
who have been most affected by the suspension of asylum, and Chinese
people, who generally fly to Ecuador and travel to the U.S. border over
land.</p>
<p>San Diego was the busiest of the Border Patrol’s nine sectors
bordering Mexico by number of arrests, followed by Tucson, Arizona.</p>
<p>More than 41,000 people entered legally through an online appointment
app called CBP One in June. The agency said 680,500 people have
successfully scheduled appointments since the app was introduced in
January 2023.</p>
<p>Nearly 500,000 people from four countries entered on a policy to
allow two-year stays on condition they have financial sponsors and
arrive at an airport. They include 104,130 Cubans, 194,027 Haitians,
86,101 Nicaraguans and 110,541 Venezuelans, according to CBP.</p>

<h2 id="biden-says-bulls-eye-reference-to-trump-was-a-mistake">Biden
says ‘bull’s-eye’ reference to Trump was a mistake</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday he made a
mistake when he told supporters to put rival Donald Trump in a
“bull’s-eye” in an effort to focus attention on his rival’s behavior but
said Trump regularly employed rhetoric that was inflammatory.</p>
<p>“It was a mistake to use the word,” Biden said in an interview with
NBC’s Lester Holt. “I meant focus on it, focus on what he’s doing,”
Biden said.</p>
<p>On July 8, Biden, 81, spoke to some of his biggest donors and said
they needed to shift the election campaign’s focus from him and his poor
debate performance to former President Trump, the Republican nominee in
the Nov. 5 election.</p>
<p>“I have one job and that’s to beat Donald Trump … We’re done talking
about the debate. It’s time to put Trump in the bull’s-eye,” he
said.</p>
<p>Some Republicans zeroed in on that comment as they blamed Biden for
creating a climate that sparked the assassination attempt on Trump at a
rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. Biden has repeatedly decried
political violence.</p>
<p>The president has endured more than two weeks of questions about his
political future, so far facing down calls to step aside as the
Democratic presidential candidate after his poor performance against
Trump in the debate on June 27 sparked a crisis within his party.</p>
<p>He reiterated in the interview that he is not leaving the race, while
acknowledging that people’s questions about his age were legitimate.</p>
<p>Biden also weighed in on Trump’s selection of Senator J.D. Vance of
Ohio as his running mate.</p>
<p>Asked by NBC’s Lester Holt what Vance’s selection said about Trump’s
values, Biden replied: “He’s going to surround himself with people who
agree completely with him.” Biden, chuckling, also noted some of Vance’s
previously critical comments about Trump.</p>
<p>The president has sought to turn attention to his opponent,
highlighting Trump’s falsehoods, his refusal to accept the 2020 election
results and his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.</p>
<p>“I’m not the guy that said I want to be a dictator on day one. I’m
not the guy that refused to accept the outcome of the election,” Biden
said.</p>
<p>He said Trump had engaged in inflammatory rhetoric, citing the former
president’s comments about a bloodbath ensuing if he loses the 2024
election and making fun when former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s
husband Paul was attacked by an intruder with a hammer at their
home.</p>
<p>“How do you talk about the threat to democracy, which is real, when a
president says things like he says? Do you just not say anything because
it may incite somebody?” Biden said. “I have not engaged in that
rhetoric. Now … my opponent’s engaged in that rhetoric.”</p>
<p>Biden, who is seeking to prove that he is fit to stand for reelection
and govern for a second four-year term despite concerns about his age,
noted that millions of people had voted for him to be the Democratic
Party’s nominee. “I listen to them,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="trump-taps-ohios-junior-senator-as-his-running-mate">Trump taps
Ohio’s junior senator as his running mate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-16, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Milwaukee — Former U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday selected
J.D. Vance, a senator from the Midwestern state of Ohio, as his running
mate in November’s presidential election.</p>
<p>Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social media platform,
saying he decided the Marine Corps veteran and Yale Law School graduate
is “the person best suited” to become vice president of the United
States.</p>
<p>Shortly after Trump’s naming of the 39-year-old Vance, the bearded
senator took a victory lap on the floor of the Republican National
Convention in Milwaukee as thousands of delegates cheered.</p>
<p>Trump drew his own cheers late Monday as he made an appearance at the
convention sporting a bandage on his right ear from an assassination
attempt at his Saturday campaign rally.</p>
<p>Vance is expected to address the gathering on Wednesday, the night
before Trump formally accepts the party’s presidential nomination for
the third consecutive time.</p>
<p>“I think it was an excellent choice,” an excited Ginger Howard, a
party national committeewoman from Georgia, told VOA on the floor of the
convention. “I think they’re going to make a great team.”</p>
<p>Just before boarding Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland,
President Joe Biden, responding to a reporter’s question about Vance’s
selection, termed the senator “a clone of Trump on the issues. I don’t
see any difference.”</p>
<p>Biden’s reelection campaign was quick to elaborate, characterizing
Vance as a willing servant to Trump’s more autocratic and regressive
undertakings.</p>
<p>Trump, twice impeached and now a convicted felon for falsifying
business records, picked Vance because he “will do what Mike Pence
wouldn’t on January 6: bend over backwards to enable Trump and his
extreme MAGA agenda, even if it means breaking the law and no matter the
harm to the American people,” said Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, who chairs
the Biden-Harris campaign.</p>
<p>Trump has downplayed the severity of the January 6, 2021, riot at the
U.S. Capitol, framing it as a legitimate protest against what he claimed
without evidence was a “stolen” 2020 presidential election. He has also
criticized the subsequent federal investigation and prosecution of those
involved, labeling it a witch hunt politically motivated by Biden, his
opponent in a second consecutive election.</p>
<p>Biden’s running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, is “fully
prepared” to debate Vance under the format proposed by CBS News,
according to the Democrats’ campaign.</p>
<p>“Trump’s VP pick is great news for wealthy Americans and terrible for
everybody else,” Senator Elizabeth Warren told reporters on a
Biden-Harris campaign conference call shortly after the former
president’s announcement of his running mate.</p>
<p>“Social Security and Medicare cuts will bear down on seniors like an
avalanche” if Trump and Vance are elected, predicted Warren. “Millions
will face losing access to health insurance.”</p>
<p>Vance has emerged as a strong advocate of Trump and his hard-line
policies, from immigration restrictions to cuts for social programs. But
as was true of numerous other prominent Republicans when the New York
real estate developer first ran for president eight years ago, Vance had
been highly critical of Trump.</p>
<p>“Trump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc.
Because of this I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,” Vance
said on Twitter in October 2016. He subsequently deleted the tweet.</p>
<p>Vance, a venture capitalist before being elected a senator, first
rose to prominence with his memoir Hillbilly Elegy, which was made into
a Hollywood movie. The book and film chronicle his experiences coming of
age in a struggling working-class family in the Appalachian region.</p>
<p>With his name aside Trump’s on the 2024 ticket, Vance immediately
becomes the most prominent Republican to be passed the torch of a
political party radically reframed by Trumpism.</p>
<p>Trump, if he is elected again and serves a full second term, would be
82 the day he leaves office.</p>
<p>Biden’s cognitive abilities at his current age of 81 have emerged as
a major campaign issue and divided his own Democratic Party, with a
growing number of prominent Democrats in and out of Congress calling for
him to abandon his reelection bid in favor of a younger replacement.</p>
<p>“Trump wanted a younger candidate who can campaign and connect with
working-class voters, especially in the Midwest. Vance is also the first
millennial to appear as a major party nominee on a presidential ticket,
representing a generational change in U.S. politics,” said Cayce Myers,
a Virginia Tech professor of public relations.</p>
<p>Vance would become the second-youngest vice president in U.S. history
if elected along with Trump. Democrat John C. Breckinridge was 36 when
he took the oath of office as vice president on March 4, 1857, under
President James Buchanan. Republican Richard Nixon, as President Dwight
Eisenhower’s vice president, was 40 when he took on the role in 1953.
Breckinridge failed in his subsequent quest for the presidency. Nixon
was elected president in 1968 after a losing bid eight years
earlier.</p>
<p>A survey of 3,000 U.S. adults conducted Monday by polling firm YouGov
indicated a lack of strong opinions on Trump’s choice of Vance,
particularly among political independents.</p>
<p>Asked if they had a favorable opinion of Vance, 43% of all
respondents said they were not sure, compared to the equal split of 29%
who said they had either favorable or unfavorable views.</p>
<p>Among respondents who identified as independents, 53% said they were
not sure whether they viewed Vance favorably or unfavorably.</p>
<p>Self-identified Republicans had the highest views of Vance, with 33%
selecting very favorable, while 46% of self-identified Democrats chose
very unfavorable.</p>
<p>Roman Mamonov of VOA’s Russian Service contributed to this
report.</p>
