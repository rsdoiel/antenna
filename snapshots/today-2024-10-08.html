<p>
Hurricane Milton has horrified meteorologists with its swift
transformation into a monster system, exploding from a Category 1 storm
into a Category 5 storm in about 18 hours. As of this morning it has
maximum sustained winds of 155 mph,

to</a> the National Hurricane Center, and is expected to make landfall
near Tampa, Florida, overnight on Wednesday. Milton will likely weaken
slightly as it approaches the Sunshine State but will nonetheless bring
life-threatening wind, rain, and storm surge to an area still in tatters
from last month’s Hurricane Helene. “If Milton stays on its course this
will be the most powerful hurricane to hit Tampa Bay in over 100 years,”
the Tampa Bay National Weather Service

The Federal Emergency Management Agency is under strain from
back-to-back extreme weather events, including Hurricane Helene and
looming Hurricane Milton. Last week Homeland Security Secretary
Alejandro Mayorkas warned that FEMA “does not have the funds” to get
through the rest of hurricane season. The agency’s former administrator,
Craig Fugate,

<em>Bloomberg</em> the damage from Milton could be more costly than
Helene’s. Staff shortages are compounding funding shortfalls, with just
9% of FEMA workers available to respond to disasters as of Monday, as
personnel struggle to address a number of recent disasters in other
parts of the country. “The agency is simultaneously supporting over 100
major disaster declarations,” Brock Long, who led FEMA during the Trump
administration,

Heatmap’s Katie Brigham</a> that while about two-thirds of the world’s
lithium is contained in brine rather than hard rock, only about 15% to
20% of these brines are currently worth mining. Lithios, he said, will
get that number up to around 80% to 85%, in theory. The funding is led
by Clean Energy Ventures with support from Lowercarbon Capital, among
others. The round included $10 million in venture funding and $2 million
in venture debt loans from Silicon Valley Bank.

As Hurricane Milton barrels toward the Tampa Bay region, home to some 3

id="china-is-oversupplying-lithium-to-eliminate-rivals-us-official-says">China
is oversupplying lithium to eliminate rivals, US official says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LISBON — Chinese lithium producers are flooding the global market
with the critical metal and causing a “predatory” price drop as they
seek to eliminate competing projects, a senior U.S. official said on a
visit to Portugal that has ample lithium reserves.</p>
<p>Jose Fernandez, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the
environment at the U.S. Department of State, told a briefing late on
Monday that China was producing much more lithium “than the world needs
today, by far.”</p>
<p>“That is an intentional response by the People’s Republic of China to
what we are trying to do” with the Inflation Reduction Act - the largest
climate and energy investment package in U.S. history valued at over
$400 billion, Fernandez said.</p>
<p>“They engage in predatory pricing… [they] lower the price until
competition disappears,’’ Fernandez said. ’’That is what is
happening.”</p>
<p>China accounts for about two-thirds of the world’s lithium chemical
output, which is mainly used in battery technologies including for
electric cars. Prices of lithium have fallen more than 80% in the past
year largely due to overproduction from China and a drop in demand for
electric vehicles.</p>
<p>However, the price collapse is also affecting China as it has forced
Chinese companies like battery giant CATL to suspend production at
certain mines.</p>
<p>Job cuts</p>
<p>Europe aims to reduce its dependence on imports from China and other
countries of lithium and other materials essential to the green
transition.</p>
<p>Fernandez said the low price “constrains our ability to diversify our
supply chains on a broad, global scale” and also hurts countries such as
Portugal that need investment to develop these industries.</p>
<p>Falling prices have forced many global lithium producers to scale
back production and cut jobs.</p>
<p>Portugal, with some 60,000 tons of known reserves, is already
Europe’s biggest producer of lithium, traditionally mined for
ceramics.</p>
<p>Along with neighboring Spain, the country wants to take advantage of
local lithium deposits, aiming to cover the entire value chain from
mining and refining to cell and battery manufacturing to battery
recycling.</p>
<p>Several mining companies in Portugal have been looking for financing,
customers and suppliers to crank up projects.</p>
<p>“We want to help them, and we think we can… lithium mining companies,
everywhere, have to survive this difficult phase that was created by
predatory pricing,” Fernandez said.</p>
<p>China’s Premier Li Qiang in June used his address at a World Economic
Forum meeting in Dalian to hit back at accusations from the United
States and E.U. that Chinese firms benefit from unfair subsidies and are
poised to flood their markets with cheap green technologies.</p>
<p>Trade tensions intensified last Friday when the European Union said
it would press ahead with hefty tariffs on China-made electric vehicles
to counter what it sees as unfair Chinese subsidies, after a year-long
anti-subsidy investigation. China on Tuesday imposed temporary
anti-dumping measures on imports of brandy from the E.U.</p>

Raises $12 Million to Unlock New Sources of Lithium</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81Mzc3NjgxNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MjMyOTk5OH0.exGku9nm_j6mce4_sNIyc8Cn-Otl-VU_sff6sqpwwuE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
With the markets for electric vehicles and battery energy storage
systems on the come-up, energy market analysts predict that the world is
hurtling towards a global lithium shortage by the 2030’s. Lithios, a
Massachusetts-based startup with a novel method of lithium extraction,
is aiming to help by unlocking previously untapped lithium resources
around the world.
</p>
<p>
The company just raised a $12 million seed round to help fund this
mission, led by Clean Energy Ventures with support from Lowercarbon
Capital, among others. The round included $10 million in venture funding
and $2 million in venture debt loans from Silicon Valley Bank.
</p>
<p>
It’s not as if the world actually lacks for lithium, the energy dense
mineral that is the primary component in lithium-ion batteries. It’s
just that many current reserves are too low-grade to be economically
exploited, and traditional extraction methods are land-intensive,
inefficient, and often controversial with local communities. Chile,
Australia, and China dominate the market, while the U.S. contributes
less than 2% of the world’s annual supply.
</p>
<p>
Lithios aims to make it more economical and environmentally friendly to
extract lithium from salty groundwater deposits, a.k.a. brines. The
company’s CEO, Mo Alkhadra, told me that while about two-thirds of the
world’s lithium is contained in brine rather than hard rock, only about
15% to 20% of these brines are currently worth mining. Lithios, he said,
will get that number up to around 80% to 85%, in theory. “The vision
with Lithios’ tech is to enable access to these lower-grade resources at
a similar or maybe slightly higher cost structure relative to the
highest grade deposits that are mined today,” Alkhadra explained.
</p>
<p>
The normal lithium brine extraction process involves pumping saline
water from underground reservoirs to the surface, where it’s then moved
through a series of
<a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/144393/where-batteries-begin" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>large,
wildly colored evaporation ponds</u></a>, often located in the middle of
vast salt deserts. Over a period of about 18 months, the sun slowly
evaporates the brine, leaving behind increasingly high concentrations of
lithium. But Lithios’ tech avoids these ponds altogether. Instead, the
brine is pumped to the surface and delivered directly to the company’s
refrigerator-sized electrochemical reactors, which contain stacks of
electrodes that capture the lithium.
</p>
<p>
While the company wouldn’t disclose the electrodes’ exact chemistry,
Alkhadra told me they are made from “inorganic compounds which have
geometries that fit basically only lithium and none of the other larger
ions that you would find in these brine mixtures.” After lithium is
extracted, the company produces a purified lithium concentrate and sends
that off for refining into battery chemicals. The final batteries could
end up in EVs, energy storage systems, or even just plain old portable
consumer electronics.
</p>
<p>
Lithios’ tech comes at a good time, as the Inflation Reduction Act’s
domestic content requirements for EVs incentivizes manufacturers to
source critical minerals from the U.S. and countries that the U.S. has
free trade agreements with. Alkhadra told me that Lithios could open up
opportunities for brine mining in the Smackover formation, which spans a
number of southern states including Texas and Arkansas,
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/04/the-salton-sea-could-produce-the-worlds-greenest-lithium.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Salton Sea area</u></a>, which has been dubbed “Lithium Valley,” as well
as deposits in Utah and Nevada. More areas in Canada and Europe could
also be in play. (The company said it couldn’t talk yet about any
specific partnership agreements.)
</p>
<p>
While there are a number of other companies such as
<a href="https://lilacsolutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lilac
Solutions</u></a> and
<a href="https://energyx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>EnergyX</u></a>
that are also pursuing more efficient and less land-intensive
brine-based extraction methods, they rely on a different, purely
chemical process known as direct lithium extraction, which uses
technology adapted from the water treatment industry. “The core thesis
around what we’re building at Lithios stems from that work,” Alkhadra
told me, explaining that electrifying these chemical processes makes
them “much more selective, energy efficient, and water efficient” —
resulting in “modest to significant cost reduction.”
</p>
<p>
Lithios’ new funding will help the company scale its research and
development efforts as well as build out a pilot facility in Medford,
Massachusetts, with initial production to begin in the first quarter of
next year. At first, output will be limited to just “several battery
packs” per year, Alkhadra told me, scaling up to commercial production
“in the coming years.”
</p>
<p>
Alkhadra is excited to see investors and the federal government alike
beginning to express interest in the upstream, “dirtier” portions of the
battery supply chain, which he told me have generally been overlooked in
favor of downstream sectors such as battery manufacturing and cell
production. “I think the U.S. departments of both energy and defense,
and investors too, are coming to realize that the real bottlenecks in
battery manufacturing and EV production are on the resource side.”

<h2 id="milton-could-strike-florida-wednesday">Milton could strike
Florida Wednesday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT MYERS BEACH, Fla. — Florida’s Gulf Coast braced Tuesday for the
impact of Hurricane Milton’s near-record winds and expected massive
storm surge, which could bring destruction to areas already reeling from
Helene’s devastation 12 days ago and still recovering from Ian’s wrath
two years ago.</p>
<p>Almost the entirety of Florida’s west coast was under a hurricane
warning early Tuesday as the Category 5 storm and its 265 kph winds
crept toward the state at 14 kph, sucking energy from the Gulf of
Mexico’s warm water. The strongest Atlantic hurricane on record is
1980’s Allen, which reached wind speeds of 306 kph as it moved through
the Caribbean and Gulf before striking Texas and Mexico.</p>
<p>Milton’s center could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region,
which has not endured a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than a
century. Scientists expect the system to weaken slightly before
landfall, though it could retain hurricane strength as it churns across
central Florida toward the Atlantic Ocean. That would largely spare
other states ravaged by Helene, which killed at least 230 people on its
path from Florida to the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay has not been hit directly by a major hurricane since 1921,
and authorities fear luck is about to run out for the region and its 3.3
million residents. President Joe Biden approved an emergency declaration
for Florida, and U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor said 7,000 federal workers were
mobilized to help in one of the largest mobilizations of federal
personnel in history.</p>
<p>“This is the real deal here with Milton,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor
told a Monday news conference. “If you want to take on Mother Nature,
she wins 100% of the time.”</p>
<p>The Tampa Bay area is still rebounding from Helene and its powerful
surge — a wall of water up to 2.4 meters it created even though its eye
was 160 kilometers offshore. Twelve people died there, with the worst
damage along a string of barrier islands from St. Petersburg to
Clearwater.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned that Milton could bring a possible 2.4- to
3.6-meter storm surge, leading to evacuation orders being issued for
beach communities all along the Gulf coast. In Florida, that means
anyone who stays is on their own and first responders are not expected
to risk their lives to rescue them at the height of the storm.</p>
<p>Stragglers were a problem during Helene and 2022’s Ian. Many
residents failed to heed ample warnings, saying they evacuated during
previous storms only to have major surges not materialize. But there was
evidence Monday that people were getting out before Milton arrives.</p>
<p>A steady stream of vehicles headed north toward the Florida Panhandle
on Interstate 75, the main highway on the west side of the peninsula, as
residents heeded evacuation orders. Traffic clogged the southbound lanes
of the highway for miles as other residents headed for the relative
safety of Fort Lauderdale and Miami on the other side of the state.</p>
<p>About 240 kilometers south of Tampa, Fort Myers Beach was nearly a
ghost town by Monday afternoon as an evacuation order took effect. Ian
devastated the 5,000-resident community two years ago, its 4.5-meter
storm surge destroying or severely damaging 400 homes and businesses.
Fourteen people died there as they tried to ride out the storm, and
dozens had to be rescued.</p>
<p>On Monday, the few residents who could be found were racing against
the clock to safeguard their buildings and belongings. None said they
were staying.</p>
<p>The signs of Ian’s devastation remain visible everywhere. Rebuilt
homes stand next to others in various states of construction. There are
numerous vacant lots, which were once rare.</p>
<p>“This whole street used to be filled out with houses,” said Mike
Sandell, owner of Pool-Rific Services. His workers were removing and
storing pumps and heaters Monday from his clients’ pools so they
wouldn’t get destroyed.</p>
<p>Home construction supplies like bricks, piping and even workers’
outhouses lined the streets, potential projectiles that could do further
damage if a surge hits.</p>
<p>At the beach Monday afternoon, workers busily emptied the triple-wide
trailer that houses The Goodz, a combined hardware, convenience, fishing
supply, ice cream and beach goods store. Owner Graham Belger said he
moved his “Your Island Everything Store” into the trailer after Ian
destroyed his permanent building across the street.</p>
<p>“We’ll rebuild, but it is going to be bad,” he said.</p>
<p>Nearby, Don Girard and his son Dominic worked to batten down the
family’s three-story combination rental and vacation home that’s about
30.5 meters from the water. It’s first-floor garage and entranceway were
flooded by Helene last month, Hurricane Debby in August, and a tide
brought by a recent supermoon.</p>
<p>Ian was by far the worst. Its waves crashed into the 14-year-old
home’s second floor, destroying the flooring. Girard repaired the
damage, and his aqua-blue and white home stands in contrast to the
older, single-story house across the street. It was submerged by Ian,
never repaired and remains vacant. Its once-off-white walls are now
tinged with brown. Plywood covers the holes that once contained windows
and doors.</p>
<p>Girard, who owns a banner and flag company in Texas, said that while
his feelings about owning his home are mostly positive, they are
becoming mixed. He said every December, his extended family gathers
there for the holidays. At that time of year, temperatures in southwest
Florida are usually in the low 20s Celsius with little rain or humidity.
The area and its beaches fill with tourists.</p>
<p>“At Christmas, there is no better place in the world,” Girard
said.</p>
<p>But flooding from Ian, the other storms and now Milton is leaving him
frustrated.</p>
<p>“It’s been difficult, I’m not going to lie to you,” Girard said. “The
last couple years have been pretty bad.”</p>

<h2 id="us-warns-voters-of-disinformation-deluge">US warns voters of
disinformation deluge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — American voters are likely about to be swamped by a
flood of misinformation and influence campaigns engineered by U.S.
adversaries aiming, according to senior U.S. intelligence officials, to
sway the results of the upcoming presidential election and cast doubt on
the process itself.</p>
<p>The latest assessment from the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence, issued Monday, comes just 29 days before the November 5
election that will see U.S. voters choose the country’s next president
and cast ballots in hundreds of other state and local races. </p>
<p>“We’ve continued to see actors ramp up their activities as we get
closer to Election Day,” said a senior U.S. intelligence official,
briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>“They recognize that individuals are already voting, and operations
can have a greater impact as we get closer to Election Day,” the
official said, noting that the election itself may just be a starting
point.</p>
<p>“The intelligence community expects foreign influence actors to
continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the
election results after the polls close,” the official added.</p>
<p>A second U.S. intelligence official warned the pace of such influence
efforts, especially those targeting specific races or political
campaigns, has also picked up.</p>
<p>“We have had more than a threefold increase,” the official said,
explaining that the number of private briefings to candidates and
campaigns has likewise jumped.</p>
<p>Intelligence agencies also cautioned that U.S. adversaries will
likely seize upon the damage done by Hurricane Helene and potential
damage from Hurricane Milton as it strengthens off the U.S. coastline to
further amplify and manufacture narratives meant to undermine confidence
in the election results.</p>
<p>“It does take time for those types of narratives to be formed and put
out into the wild, so to speak,” the first intelligence official said.
“But we certainly expect foreign countries to take advantage of such
situations and promote further divisive rhetoric.”</p>
<p>Monday’s assessment follows a series of earlier public warnings about
foreign efforts to meddle in the U.S. election.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said Monday that Russia, Iran and China continue to be
responsible for most of the influence efforts targeting U.S. voters.</p>
<p>And, they said, there have been no indications that any of those
countries have changed their goals. </p>
<p>Russia, they said, continues to run influence campaigns aimed at
boosting the chances of former U.S. President and Republican
presidential nominee Donald Trump, while seeking to hurt the campaign of
Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>Iran’s efforts remain focused on helping Harris by hurting Trump,
they said, pointing to the ongoing hack-and-leak operation against the
Trump campaign, which has been traced to three operatives working for
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</p>
<p>Targeting state, local races</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies assess that China has yet to wade into the
U.S. presidential campaign, focusing instead on persuading American
voters to reject state and local candidates perceived as detrimental to
Beijing’s interests, especially those voicing support for Taiwan. </p>
<p>But the latest public assessment pointed to some changes.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials on Monday warned that Russia and Cuba
have joined China, in targeting congressional, state and local
races.</p>
<p>“Moscow is leveraging a wide range of influence actors in an effort
to influence congressional races, particularly to encourage the U.S.
public to oppose pro-Ukraine policies and politicians,” the intelligence
official said.</p>
<p>“Havana almost certainly has considered influence efforts targeting
some candidates,” the official added. “This is consistent with what
they’ve done in past cycles.”</p>
<p>Russia, China and Iran have all rejected previous U.S. accusations of
election meddling. Russia, Iran and Cuba have yet to respond to requests
from VOA for comment on the latest U.S. findings.</p>
<p>China late Monday again dismissed the U.S. concerns.</p>
<p>“China is not interested in the U.S. congressional election, and we
have no intention and will not interfere in it,” Liu Pengyu, the
spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an
email.</p>
<p>“Some U.S. congressmen stick to their wrong positions on the Taiwan
question,” Liu added. “China firmly defends its national sovereignty and
territorial integrity, but this does not lead to the conclusion that
China has interfered in the congressional elections.”</p>
<p>But the U.S. intelligence assessments align with concerns voiced by
some lawmakers and private technology companies.</p>
<p>“The 48 hours after the polls close, especially if we have as close
an election as we anticipate, could be equally if not more significant
in terms of spreading false information, disinformation and literally
undermining the tenets of our democracy,” Mark Warner, chair of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, said during a hearing last month.</p>
<p>‘Vigorous activity’ </p>
<p>Microsoft President Brad Smith, who has warned that the most perilous
moments could come in the 48 hours before the U.S. election, separately
said the increase in malign cyber efforts by Russia and Iran,
especially, is undeniable.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing vigorous activity,” Smith told a cyber conference last
month. “We’re seeing the Iranians really target the Republican Party in
the Trump campaign,” he said. “We’re seeing the Russians target the
Democratic Party and now the Harris campaign.”</p>
<p>And it is unclear what impact the U.S. has made with its attempts to
counter the growing number of foreign influence efforts.</p>
<p>Last month, the U.S. Justice Department seized 32 internet domains
used by companies linked to Moscow to spread disinformation. At the same
time, the department indicted employees of the state-controlled media
outlet RT in connection with a plot to launder Russian propaganda
through a U.S.-based media company.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence officials on Monday, however, said such tactics are
no longer unique to the Kremlin. </p>
<p>“Foreign influence actors are getting better at hiding their hand and
using Americans to do it,” said one of the U.S. intelligence officials.
“Foreign countries calculate that Americans are more likely to believe
other Americans compared to content with clear signs of foreign
propaganda.”</p>
<p>Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on

id="trump-harris-mark-somber-anniversary-of-hamas-oct.-7-attack-on-israel">Trump,
Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Former President Donald Trump and Vice
President Kamala Harris are marking the anniversary of the deadliest
attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates
approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in
the Middle East.</p>
<p>Political leaders across the spectrum were marking the killing of
about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, by Hamas-led militants
in the October 7 attack last year, and the taking of about 250 hostages.
A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in
captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage
release deal have sputtered out.</p>
<p>Trump visited the New York City gravesite of Rabbi Menachem Mendel
Schneerson, who led the Chabad-Lubavitch movement of Orthodox Judaism
from 1951 until his death in 1994. Schneerson was the movement’s seventh
leader, known as Lubavitcher Rebbe. Trump then will speak before Jewish
community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of
Doral.</p>
<p>Harris and her husband planted a pomegranate tree on the grounds of
the vice president’s residence in honor of the those killed a year
ago.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, recited
a prayer for peace at an event to commemorate the anniversary hosted by
the American Jewish Committee in Washington.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden also hosted a somber
memorial ceremony at the White House Monday to mark the anniversary of
the attack. The Bidens looked on as Rabbi Aaron Alexander of
Washington’s Adas Israel Congregation recited the Jewish remembrance
prayer for the more than 1,200 people, including dozens of Americans,
killed that day, listing the towns, villages and festival site that were
the scenes of the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.</p>
<p>The president then lit a lone memorial candle placed on a small table
at the center of the Blue Room, before they observed a moment of
silence.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Biden spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog,
the White House said.</p>
<p>The attack sparked a deadly war in Gaza, as Israel moved to root out
Hamas’ control over the territory and try to return those taken captive.
Israel’s military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians,
including many women and children, according to the Hamas-run health
ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and
civilians.</p>
<p>Another Iran-backed group, Hezbollah, has fired thousands of rockets
at Israeli territory in the same period from Lebanon, and Israel last
month expanded a campaign of sabotage and assassination and launched a
ground incursion into Lebanon to combat the threat from the group.</p>
<p>In 1997, the U.S. State Department designated both Hezbollah and
Hamas as foreign terrorist organizations. Many other countries also
label them as terrorist groups, although some apply the designation only
to their military wings.</p>

<h2 id="openbsd-7.6-released">OpenBSD 7.6 released</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>OpenBSD 7.6, the release in which every single line of the original
code form the first release has been edited or removed, has been
released. There’s a lot of changes, new features, bug fixes, and more in
7.6, but for desktop users, the biggest new feature is undoubtedly
hardware-accelerated video decoding through VA-API. Or, as the changelog
puts it: Imported libva 2.22.0, an implementation for VA-API (video
acceleration API). VA-API provides access to graphics hardware
acceleration capabilities for video processing. ↫ OpenBSD 7.6 release
announcement This is a massive improvement for anyone using OpenBSD for
desktop use, especially on power-constrained devices like laptops.
Problematic video playback was one of the reasons I went back to Fedora
KDE after running OpenBSD on my workstation, and it seems this would
greatly improve that situation. I can’t wait until I find some time to
reinstall OpenBSD and see how much difference this will make for me
personally. There’s more, of course. OpenBSD 7.6 starts the bring-up for
Snapdragon X Elite devices, and in general comes with a whole slew of
low-level improvements for the ARM64 architecture. AMD64 systems don’t
have to feel left out, thanks to AVX-512 support, several power
management improvements to make sleep function more optimally, and
several other low-level improvements I don’t fully understand. RISC-V,
PowerPC, MIPS, and other architectures also saw small numbers of
improvements. The changelog is vast, so be sure to dig through it to see
if your pet bug has been addressed, or support for your hardware has
been improved. OpenBSD users will know how to upgrade, and for new
installations, head on over to the download page.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
The “Meteorologists” Facebook page has 51,000 followers, an iffy grasp
of grammar rules, and outsized confidence in the United States’ weather
engineering capabilities. “They are Aiming this KILLER Monster Hurricane
Right at FLORIDA!” one user said of Hurricane Milton on Sunday morning,
shortly before sharing purported photos of dinosaurs living on Mars.
</p>
<p>
By Monday afternoon, Milton had strengthened into a
<a href="https://x.com/philklotzbach/status/1843398813027053696" target="_blank">Category
5 storm</a>, and the internet conspiracies were intensifying, too.
People shared videos of themselves
<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gammieluvs4/video/7422816848955051307" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asking
their Alexas</u></a>, “What kind of hurricane was Hurricane Milton?” and
getting answers in the past tense — proof, surely, that the government
orchestrated the whole storm. “Never ever seen a hurricane form in the
western Gulf and head directly EAST… It is not right,” other users mused
in the comment sections of their local weather channels. A search for
“<a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=cloud%20seeding%20hurricane%20milton" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cloud
seeding</u></a>” on Facebook further turned up dozens of posts tracking
flight paths for planes belonging to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and sharing photos of ominous-looking clouds
as evidence that the “government is involved.”
</p>
<p>
Hoaxes and misinformation reliably follow extreme weather events.
Pictures of
<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hurricane-shark" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hurricane
Shark</u></a> have circulated on social media after pretty much every
major flood since 2011, and a
<a href="https://www.phillymag.com/news/2012/10/29/awesome-hurricane-sandy-photo-statue-liberty-fake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>photoshopped
image</u></a> of a storm cell over the Statue of Liberty resurfaces
anytime there is bad weather in New York. In the aftermath of a major
disaster, it’s especially tempting for bad actors to
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/02/1126480393/after-the-storm-the-scams-lies-and-misinformation-flood-in" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>exploit</u></a>
the desperation for news and images.
</p>
<p>
But Hurricane Helene — which devastated
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>swaths
of Florida</u></a> up into the
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/hurricane-helene-appalachia-tennessee" target="_self"><u>Appalachians</u></a>
just over a week ago — revealed how far this has spun out of control.
For one thing, hoaxes are simpler than ever for the average person to
disseminate,
<a href="https://x.com/O_Rob1nson/status/1841433705186804145" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>thanks
to the availability of AI image-making tools</u></a> and the degradation
of content moderation on
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/elon-musk-twitter-blue-natural-disaster-crisis-emergency-response/673209/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disaster-response
platforms like Twitter</u></a>. These conspiracies may also then be
reinforced and amplified by people with an interest in making the
government’s response look bad — such as
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/politics/fact-check-trump-helene-response-north-carolina/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
Republican candidate for president of the United States</u></a>, a

<p>
While some lies — like Deep State cloud seeding — are relatively easy to
see through, many rumors are much more difficult to fact-check when
power, cell service, and internet are limited. Nicole McNeill, the
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-death-toll-asheville-north-carolina-34d1226bb31f79dfb2ff6827e40587fc#:~:text=The%20city%20of%20Asheville%2C%20in%20the%20western%20mountains%20of%20North%20Carolina%2C%20was%20particularly%20battered." target="_blank">Asheville,
North Carolina</a>-based director of storytelling of Climate Power, told
me she and many of her neighbors fell for
<a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/10/01/is-another-hurricane-coming-to-wnc-tropical-storm-kirk-impact/75466027007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
widespread rumor</u></a> that a second storm was going to hit the
western part of the state immediately after Helene. The panic the rumor
sparked risked lives: She saw a fight break out in a gas line between
two men who were frantically trying to get out of town, and a young
couple who were renting a home nearby tried to flee and ended up on a
road that was closed. “We heard later that people had to sleep in their
cars,” McNeill told me. “Local police had to be diverted from emergency
response to direct traffic to clear the roads so emergency vehicles
could pass. Misinformation made a desperate situation worse.” McNeill
herself suffered a panic attack while trying to fix the holes in her
roof from trees that had fallen during Helene, all in preparation for
the second storm that would never come.
</p>
<p>
While there was no merit to those manufactured claims, the truth is in
some ways even more alarming: Milton is looking like a worst-case
scenario storm as it bears down on Tampa Bay, and at this point, the
only thing anyone <em><em>can</em></em> control is getting good
information to the people whose lives will depend on hearing it.
Forecasters are doing a great job of that already, like South Florida
hurricane specialist John Morales, who
<a href="https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1843362454321115138" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>let
his emotions show on air</u></a> and connected the storm’s
intensification to climate science.
</p>
<p>
Milton isn’t due to make landfall until Wednesday, but the
misinformation already circulating online will make it more challenging
for early warnings from the government and local experts to be heard and
trusted. That job doesn’t get any easier after a storm. To fellow
hurricane survivors, McNeill warned, “If you have patchy internet and
you’re at 30% battery and worried about your phone running out, you’re
often making split-second decisions. That’s where misinformation gets
people.”

must crack open Android for third-party stores, rules Epic judge</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>Late last year, Google’s Play Store was ruled to be a monopoly in the
US, and today the judge in that case has set out what Google must do to
address this situation. Today, Judge James Donato issued his final
ruling in Epic v. Google, ordering Google to effectively open up the
Google Play app store to competition for three whole years. Google will
have to distribute rival third-party app stores within Google Play, and
it must give rival third-party app stores access to the full catalog of
Google Play apps, unless developers opt out individually. ↫ Sean
Hollister at The Verge On top of these rather big changes, Google also
cannot mandate the use of Google’s own billing solution, nor can it
prohibit developers from informing users of other ways to download
and/or pay for an application. Furthermore, Google can’t make sweetheart
deals with device makers to entice them to install the Play Store or to
block them from installing other stores, and Google can’t pay developers
to only use the Play Store or not use other stores. It’s a rather
comprehensive set of remedies that will remain in force for three years.
Many of these remedies are taken straight from the European Union’s
Digital Markets Act, but they will be far less effective since they’re
only applied to one company, and only for three years. On top of that,
Google can appeal, and the company has already stated that it’s going to
ask for an immediate stay on these remedies, and if they get that stay,
the remedies won’t have to be implemented any time soon. This legal
tussling is far from over, and does very little to protect consumer
choice. A clear law that simply prohibits this kind of market abuse,
like the DMA, is much fairer to everyone involved, and creates a
consistent level playing field for everyone, instead of only affecting
random companies based on the whims of something as unpredictable as
juries. In other words, I don’t think much is going to change in the
United States after this ruling, and we’ll likely be hearing more back
and forths in the court room for years to come, all while US consumers
are being harmed. It’s better than nothing in lieu of a working Congress
actually doing, well, anything, but that’s not saying much.</p>

Supreme Court halts ruling striking down state’s near-ban on
abortions</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>savannah, georgia — The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday halted a
ruling striking down the state’s near-ban on abortions while it
considers the state’s appeal.</p>
<p>The high court’s order came a week after a judge found that Georgia
unconstitutionally prohibits abortions beyond about six weeks of
pregnancy, often before women realize they’re pregnant. Fulton County
Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Sept. 30 that privacy rights
under Georgia’s state constitution include the right to make personal
health care decisions.</p>
<p>It was one of a wave of restrictive abortion laws passed in
Republican-controlled states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe
v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion. It prohibited
most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” was present. At
around six weeks into a pregnancy, cardiac activity can be detected by
ultrasound in an embryo’s cells that will eventually become the
heart.</p>
<p>Republican Governor Brian Kemp signed it in 2019, but it didn’t take
effect until Roe v. Wade fell.</p>
<p>McBurney wrote in his ruling that “liberty in Georgia includes in its
meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a
woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it,
and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.”</p>
<p>“When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society
can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then — and
only then — may society intervene,” McBurney wrote.</p>
<p>The judge’s decision rolled back abortion limits in Georgia to a
prior law allowing abortions until viability, roughly 22 to 24 weeks
into a pregnancy.</p>
<p>“Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been
overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,” Kemp said in a
statement in response to McBurney’s decision. “Protecting the lives of
the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities,
and Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of
the unborn.”</p>
<p>Abortion providers and advocates in Georgia had applauded McBurney’s
ruling but expressed concern that it would soon be overturned.</p>

<h2 id="us-targets-hamas-with-sanctions-on-anniversary-of-gaza-war">US
targets Hamas with sanctions on anniversary of Gaza war</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on an
international Hamas fundraising network, accusing it of playing a
critical role in external fundraising for the Palestinian militant
group, in action marking the first anniversary of the Gaza war. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions
on three people and what it called a “sham charity” that it accused of
being prominent international financial supporters of Hamas, as well as
on the Al-Intaj Bank in Gaza that it said was controlled by the
group. </p>
<p>Also targeted was a longstanding Hamas supporter, a Yemeni national
living in Turkey, and nine of his businesses, Treasury said. </p>
<p>“As we mark one year since Hamas’s brutal terrorist attack, Treasury
will continue relentlessly degrading the ability of Hamas and other
destabilizing Iranian proxies to finance their operations and carry out
additional violent acts,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in the
statement. </p>
<p>“The Treasury Department will use all available tools at our disposal
to hold Hamas and its enablers accountable, including those who seek to
exploit the situation to secure additional sources of revenue.” </p>
<p>In their rampage through Israeli towns and kibbutz villages near the
Gaza border a year ago, Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and
took about 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli figures. </p>
<p>The huge Israeli security lapse led to the single deadliest day for
Jews since the Nazi Holocaust, shattered many citizens’ sense of
security and sent their faith in its leaders to new lows. </p>
<p>The Hamas assault unleashed an Israeli offensive on Gaza that has
largely flattened the densely populated enclave and killed almost 42,000
people, Palestinian health authorities say. </p>
<p>The Treasury on Monday said: “Hamas has exploited the suffering in
Gaza to solicit funds through sham and front charities that falsely
claim to help civilians in Gaza,” adding that as of early this year, the
group may have received as much as $10 million a month through such
donations. The Treasury said Hamas considers Europe to be a key source
of fundraising. </p>
<p>Monday’s action targeted an Italy-based Hamas member the Treasury
said established the sham Charity Association of Solidarity with the
Palestinian People, which it accused of helping bankroll Hamas’ military
wing. </p>
<p>Also targeted was a senior Hamas representative in Germany and a
Hamas representative in charge of the group’s activity in Austria. </p>
<p>Hamas is a U.S. designated terrorist group.</p>

id="spacecraft-headed-to-harmless-asteroid-slammed-by-nasa-in-previous-save-the-earth-test">Spacecraft
headed to harmless asteroid slammed by NASA in previous save-the-Earth
test</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — A spacecraft blasted off Monday to investigate
the scene of a cosmic crash. </p>
<p>The European Space Agency’s Hera spacecraft rocketed away on a
two-year journey to the small, harmless asteroid rammed by NASA two
years ago in a dress rehearsal for the day a killer space rock threatens
Earth. Launched by SpaceX from Cape Canaveral, it’s the second part of a
planetary defense test that could one day help save the planet. </p>
<p>The 2022 crash by NASA’s Dart spacecraft shortened Dimorphos’ orbit
around its bigger companion, demonstrating that if a dangerous rock was
headed our way, there’s a chance it could be knocked off course with
enough advance notice. </p>
<p>Scientists are eager to examine the impact’s aftermath up close to
know exactly how effective Dart was and what changes might be needed to
safeguard Earth in the future. </p>
<p>“The more detail we can glean the better as it may be important for
planning a future deflection mission should one be needed,” University
of Maryland astronomer Derek Richardson said before launch. </p>
<p>Researchers want to know whether Dart — short for Double Asteroid
Redirection Test — left a crater or perhaps reshaped the 150-meter
(500-foot) asteroid more dramatically. It looked something like a flying
saucer before Dart’s blow and may now resemble a kidney bean, said
Richardson, who took part in the Dart mission and is helping with
Hera. </p>
<p>Dart’s wallop sent rubble and even boulders flying off Dimorphos,
providing an extra kick to the impact’s momentum. The debris trail
extended more than 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) into space for
months. </p>
<p>Some boulders and other debris could still be hanging around the
asteroid, posing a potential threat to Hera, said flight director
Ignacio Tanco. </p>
<p>“We don’t really know very well the environment in which we are going
to operate,” said Tanco. “But that’s the whole point of the mission is
to go there and find out.” </p>
<p>European officials describe the $400 million (363 million euro)
mission as a “crash scene investigation.” </p>
<p>Hera “is going back to the crime site and getting all the scientific
and technical information,” said project manager Ian Carnelli. </p>
<p>Carrying a dozen science instruments, the small car-sized Hera will
need to swing past Mars in 2025 for a gravity boost, before arriving at
Dimorphos by the end of 2026. It’s a moonlet of Didymos, Greek for twin,
a fast-spinning asteroid that’s five times bigger. At that time, the
asteroids will be 195 million kilometers (120 million miles) from
Earth. </p>
<p>Controlled by a flight team in Darmstadt, Germany, Hera will attempt
to go into orbit around the rocky pair, with the flyby distances
gradually dropping from 30 kilometers (18 miles) all the way down to 1
kilometer (a half-mile). The spacecraft will survey the moonlet for at
least six months to ascertain its mass, shape and composition, as well
as its orbit around Didymos. </p>
<p>Before the impact, Dimorphos circled its larger companion from 1,189
meters out. Scientists believe the orbit is now tighter and oval-shaped,
and that the moonlet may even be tumbling. </p>
<p>Two shoebox-sized Cubesats will pop off Hera for even closer
drone-like inspections, with one of them using radar to peer beneath the
moonlet’s boulder-strewn surface. Scientists suspect Dimorphos was
formed from material shed from Didymos. The radar observations should
help confirm whether Didymos is indeed the little moon’s parent. </p>
<p>The Cubesats will attempt to land on the moonlet once their survey is
complete. If the moonlet is tumbling, that will complicate the endeavor.
Hera may also end its mission with a precarious touchdown, but on the
larger Didymos. </p>
<p>Neither asteroid poses any threat to Earth — before or after Dart
showed up. That’s why NASA picked the pair for humanity’s first
asteroid-deflecting demo. </p>
<p>Leftovers from the solar system’s formation 4.6 billion years ago,
asteroids primarily orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in what’s
known as the main asteroid belt, where millions of them reside. They
become near-Earth objects when they’re knocked out of the belt and into
our neck of the woods. </p>
<p>NASA’s near-Earth object count currently tops 36,000, almost all
asteroids but also some comets. More than 2,400 of them are considered
potentially hazardous to Earth.</p>

<h2
id="for-us-adversaries-election-day-wont-mean-end-to-efforts-to-influence-americans">For
US adversaries, Election Day won’t mean end to efforts to influence
Americans</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and
a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will
come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with
American democracy may be entering its most critical phase.</p>
<p>Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the
months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after
voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China
or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America’s
decision.</p>
<p>That’s when Americans will go online to see the latest results or
share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that’s when a fuzzy
photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most
damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action
before authorities have time to investigate the facts.</p>
<p>It’s a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected
officials and tech executives, who say that while there’s already been a
steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may
be yet to come.</p>
<p>“It’s not like at the end of election night, particularly assuming
how close this election will be, that this will be over,” said Sen. Mark
Warner, a Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Intelligence
Committee. “One of my greatest concerns is the level of misinformation,
disinformation that may come from our adversaries after the polls close
could actually be as significant as anything that happens up to the
closing of the polls.”</p>
<p>Analysts are blunter, warning that a particularly effective piece of
disinformation could be devastating to public confidence in the election
if spread in the hours after the polls close, and if the group behind
the campaign knows to target a particularly important swing state or
voting bloc.</p>
<p>Possible scenarios include out-of-context footage of election workers
repurposed to show supposed fraud, a deepfake video of a presidential
candidate admitting to cheating or a robocall directed at non-English
speakers warning them not to vote.</p>
<p>When a false or misleading claim circulates weeks before the
election, there’s time for local election officials, law enforcement or
news organizations to gather the facts, correct any falsehoods and get
the word out. But if someone spreads a deceptive video or photo designed
to make a big chunk of the electorate distrust the results the day after
the election, it can be hard or even impossible for the truth to catch
up.</p>
<p>It happened four years ago, when a drumbeat of lies about the 2020
results spurred the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Often,
those arrested on accusations of trying to interfere with the transfer
of power have cited debunked election fraud narratives that circulated
shortly after Election Day.</p>
<p>An especially close election decided in a handful of swing states
could heighten that risk even further, making it more likely that a
rumor about suitcases of illegal ballots in Georgia, to cite an example
from 2020, could have a big impact on perceptions.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump in 2020 wasn’t
especially close, and no irregularities big enough to affect the result
were found — and yet false claims about vote-rigging were still widely
believed by many supporters of the Republican, who’s running for
president again.</p>
<p>The relatively long run-up to Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 gives those
looking to sow doubt about the results ample time to do so, whether they
are propaganda agencies in Moscow or extremist groups in the U.S. like
the Proud Boys.</p>
<p>Ryan LaSalle, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Nisos, said he won’t feel
relief until a new president is sworn in without any serious
problems.</p>
<p>“The time to stay most focused is right now through the peaceful
transfer of power,” LaSalle said. “That’s when real-life activities
could happen, and that’s when they would have the greatest chance of
having an impact on that peaceful transfer.”</p>
<p>Another risk, according to officials and tech companies, is that
Russia or another adversary would try to hack into a local or state
election system — not necessarily to change votes, but as a way of
making voters question the security of the system.</p>
<p>“The most perilous time I think will come 48 hours before the
election,” Microsoft President Brad Smith told lawmakers on the Senate
Intelligence Committee last month. The hearing focused on American tech
companies’ efforts to safeguard the election from foreign disinformation
and cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Election disinformation first emerged as a potent threat in 2016,
when Russia hacked into the campaign of Democrat Hillary Clinton and
created networks of fake social media accounts to pump out
disinformation.</p>
<p>The threat has only grown as social media has become a leading source
of information and news for many voters. Content designed to divide
Americans and make them mistrust their own institutions is no longer
tied only to election seasons. Intelligence officials say Russia, China
and other countries will only expand their use of online disinformation
and propaganda going forward, a long-range strategy that looks beyond
any one election or candidate.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, election security officials are quick to
reassure Americans that the U.S. election system is impervious to any
attack that could alter the outcome of the vote. While influence
operations may seek to spread distrust about the results, improvements
to the system make it stronger than ever when it comes to efforts to
change votes.</p>
<p>“Malicious actors, even if they tried, could not have an impact at
scale such that there would be a material effect on the outcome of the
election,” Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press.</p>

Supreme Court rebuffs Biden administration on emergency abortions in
Texas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Monday to hear a bid
by President Joe Biden’s administration to enforce in Texas federal
guidance requiring hospitals to perform abortions if needed to stabilize
a patient’s emergency medical condition.  </p>
<p>The justices turned away the Justice Department’s appeal of a lower
court’s decision that halted enforcement of the guidance in Texas, where
a Republican-backed near-total ban on abortion is in effect, and against
members of two anti-abortion medical associations.  </p>
<p>The Biden administration issued the guidance in July 2022 to protect
access to abortion after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority the
previous month overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had
legalized abortion nationwide.  </p>
<p>The guidance reminded healthcare providers across the country of
their obligations under a 1986 federal law called the Emergency Medical
Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to ensure Medicare-participating
hospitals offer emergency care stabilizing patients regardless of their
ability to pay. Medicare is the government healthcare program for the
elderly. Hospitals that violate EMTALA risk losing Medicare funding.
 </p>
<p>The guidance made clear that under that law physicians must provide a
woman an abortion if needed to resolve a medical emergency and stabilize
the patient even in states where the procedure is banned, and that the
measure preempts state bans that offer no exceptions for medical
emergencies or with exceptions that are too narrow.</p>
<p>Texas law prohibits abortions unless the pregnancy places the woman
at risk of death or “substantial impairment of a major bodily
function.”</p>
<p>Republican-governed Texas and two anti-abortion medical associations
- the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists
and the Christian Medical &amp; Dental Associations, sued the
administration, arguing that the guidance unlawfully purports to compel
healthcare providers to perform abortions.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix in 2022 blocked enforcement
of the guidance, finding that it is an unlawful interpretation of the
EMTALA statute, and would allow abortions beyond what is permitted by
Texas law.</p>
<p>The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Jan. 2
upheld Hendrix’s decision, ruling that “EMTALA does not mandate any
specific type of medical treatment, let alone abortion.” The 5th
Circuit’s decision came a month after the top court in Texas ruled
against a woman who was seeking an emergency abortion of her non-viable
pregnancy.  </p>
<p>Abortion rights advocates have challenged the scope of abortion ban
exceptions in several states due to uncertainty, including among
physicians, about what medical emergencies during pregnancy would permit
health providers to perform the procedure.</p>
<p>In a similar case in June, the Supreme Court permitted, for the time
being, abortions to be performed in Idaho when pregnant women are facing
medical emergencies.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling in the Idaho case revived a federal
judge’s decision that EMTALA takes precedence over Idaho’s
Republican-backed near-total abortion ban when the two conflict. While
the justices lifted a block they had placed on the judge’s ruling in the
case, they did not resolve the dispute on its merits, opting instead to
dismiss it as “improvidently granted.”</p>

Bilingual Window-Breaking Drones Save New Yorkers From the Next
Hurricane Sandy?</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzcyMzc5Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMjk3NTEyN30.PQbL-mY3konBnFkjPS9e8EL_gcCMiVXT7EfN7ySlf-k/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
Last week, I took a train and two buses to an abandoned tuberculosis
sanatorium on Staten Island, where I watched first responders pretend
another Hurricane Sandy had just struck New York City.
</p>
<p>
For the sake of the drill, organizers kept many of the details of the
fictional scenario the same as they’d been then: Emergency Management
officials were told to respond as if a supercharged storm was causing
devastating floods and stranding people in life-threatening situations.
But the dry run also featured a major difference from the disaster that
hit 12 years ago this month and left
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-death-study" target="_self"><u>more
than</u></a> 43 New Yorkers dead.
</p>
<p>
This time, the city has drones.
</p>
<p>
It has drones with cameras that can read the logo on your jacket from
400 feet in the air and drones with sophisticated mapping software that
can estimate how deep a flooded intersection is. It has drones that come
on little leashes tethered to NYPD cruisers for continuous power and
drones that are so small they can fly under beds and into closets and
sound like dentist drills when they’re operating. It has drones that can
transmit messages in 80 languages, drones with thermal sensors, and
drones that can drop flotation devices into the ocean. It even has a
drone that can break a window — the highlight of the morning for the
members of the local press and the top brass of the New York Police
Department, Fire Department, and NYCEM (New York City Emergency
Management, pronounced “Nee-chim,” newly rebranded from the more generic
Office of Emergency Management) who’d gathered to observe the exercise,
which was touted as the largest-known municipal unmanned aerial system
drill in history.
</p>
<p>
“Breach drones,” as I’ve since learned, look a little like crudely drawn
mosquitos. Held aloft by four rotary wings, the
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/the-nypd-is-using-drones-3-times-more-than-it-did-last-year" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$87,750</u></a>
contraptions are affixed with rods on their fronts that resemble an
insect’s proboscis but function essentially like a battering ram. Given
the drone’s unsteady, bobbing flight and the way it repeatedly banged
itself against the window to chip a hole in the pane big enough to fly
through, I found the whole demonstration to be surprisingly
<em><em>entomological</em></em> for what New York City’s first
responders claim is the bleeding edge of its extreme weather response.
</p>
<p>
“We’re really just scraping the first layer” of what is possible, Louis
Font, a citywide interagency coordinator, told me during the drill. As
he put it, drones are “the Swiss army knife of the public safety world.”
</p>
<p>
There is a small problem, though: New Yorkers really, really hate
drones. Actually, they hate <em><em>all</em></em> autonomous gadgets
that give off a whiff of Big Brother. A security robot deployed in the
Times Square subway station over the winter had to be
<a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/696-23/transcript-mayor-adams-makes-public-safety-related-announcement" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>guarded
by two human officers</u></a> around the clock to prevent it from being
vandalized, and the cheeky New York City news blog <em><em>Hell Gate
</em></em><a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/eric-adams-robocop/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>proposed</u></a>
that bots like the NYPD’s crime-fighting “Digidog” are “the city’s most
expensive punching bags” and teased, “we’re excited to watch as the
situation unfolds.” Even the local <em><em>wildlife</em></em> seems
willing to take matters into its own talons, with birds
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/nyregion/nyc-beaches-drones-angry-birds.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>attacking</u></a>
drones deployed to Rockaway Beach over the summer.
</p>
<p>
The city acquired its first set of drones in 2018 and is now one of
about
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/nyregion/nypd-drones.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>900
U.S. municipalities</u></a> that have begun using unmanned aerial
systems in its crime- and emergency-related responses. But with a police
budget
<a href="https://reason.com/2011/11/30/michael-bloomberg-i-have-my-own-army-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>bigger</u></a>
than many nations’ entire military outlay and
<a href="https://mashable.com/article/nyc-mayor-eric-adams-new-technology-hasnt-worked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
techno-optimist mayor</u></a>, New York quickly became one of the
premier drone-wielding cities in the world.
</p>
<p>
It hasn’t been an entirely smooth journey, though. Plans to use drones
to monitor
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/drones-labor-day-eric-adams-nypd-jouvert-c2787e87bcad8fa87aa8d34b454ee6cf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>private
backyard Labor Day parties</u></a> last year spurred privacy concerns
rooted in
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nypd-drone-czar-surveillence-post-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
history</u></a> of the NYPD abusing surveillance technologies and
prompted pushback from local civil liberties groups. “We’ve got so many
discredited examples of this mayor searching for high-tech gimmicks to
solve real-world problems and leaving New Yorkers out to dry,” Albert
Fox Cahn, the executive director of the Surveillance Technology
Oversight Project, a.k.a. STOP, told me. “We end up spending a huge
amount of money on largely unvetted vendors to buy products that simply
just don’t fit the needs of our city.”
</p>
<p>
The question I wanted to answer on Staten Island was whether drones
might be able to<em> </em>meet the needs of a city after a storm like
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hurricane-helene-florida-size" target="_self"><u>Hurricane
Helene</u></a> or Hurricane Sandy. The overwhelming impression I left
with, though, was of agencies that are in the awkward stage of a growth
spurt — eager to use technology that will one day be indispensable but,
for the time being, presents the risk of overcomplicating situations
that would otherwise benefit from a more old-fashioned,
boots-on-the-ground approach, with potentially both comic and tragic
results.
</p>
<p>
Much of this is simply because of the physical limitations of drones.
For one thing, they can’t fly in winds of more than about 20 to 30 miles
per hour, making them pretty much useless during an actual storm (or
<a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/nypd-drone-czar-surveillence-post-act/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
a Manhattan wind tunnel</u></a>, for that matter). That narrows their
use to two main categories: before a storm, as early warning systems,
and after, in search-and-rescue operations.
</p>
<p>
It’s easy to understand the appeal of the former use. Scientists expect
New York will get about 25% more annual rainfall by 2100
<a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/is-extreme-weather-climate-change" target="_self"><u>due
to climate change</u></a>, and the city has over 500 miles of coastline
vulnerable to storm surge, with
<a href="https://wordinblack.com/2024/04/nyc-floods-are-worst-for-those-who-can-least-afford-them/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>over
half</u></a> of
<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/emily-raboteau-lessons-for-survival" target="_self"><u>its
environmental justice communities</u></a> living within its 100-year
floodplains. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, 11 people
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/ida-s-forgotten-victims-nearly-all-storm-s-basement-deaths-n1281670" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>drowned</u></a>
in flooded basement apartments, which are illegal under the city housing
code and often used as housing by low-income immigrant families. Making
matters worse, New York’s emergency alert system requires
<a href="https://a858-nycnotify.nyc.gov/notifynyc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
voluntary opt-in</u></a> and currently has just 1,281,938 subscribers —
roughly 15% of a city of 8.3 million. Last year, the city comptroller
further
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/22/nyregion/storm-response-nyc-adams.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>claimed</u></a>
that the notification list for people living in basement apartments
reached less than 1% of its target population. (A spokesperson for NYCEM
told me there has been a 35% increase in their basement subscriber
numbers since the comptroller’s comments.)
</p>
<p>
The drones come in handy, then, because “not every New Yorker is on
Twitter, not every New Yorker is on Instagram or Facebook, not every New
Yorker reads <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>, the
<em><em>Post</em></em>, or the <em><em>Daily News</em></em>, not all of
them are tuned into our press conferences,” NYCEM Commissioner Zachary
Iscol told me. “And so especially for vulnerable populations and
immigrant communities, you’ve got to reach them where they are.”
</p>
<p>
This summer, NYCEM
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/nyregion/drones-eric-adams-flooding.html" target="_blank">piloted
a program</a> using drones to broadcast bilingual flood warnings in
low-lying neighborhoods ahead of storms — an idea Mayor Eric Adams had
after seeing hurricane sirens on telephone poles during a visit to
Puerto Rico, Iscol told me. The drones’ machine-generated Spanish
translations, however, were slammed as
“<a href="https://x.com/J__Velasquez/status/1820914162387558778" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>incomprehensible</u></a>”
by native speakers. (Font, the interagency coordinator, admitted the
translations are still crude since “they’re robots” and told me the
agencies are working to improve the messages.)

<p>
Carolina Salguero, the founder and executive director of PortSide
NewYork, which works with the waterfront community in Red Hook, told me
she fears drone-delivered storm warnings could potentially alienate
their intended audiences. “Why would you believe the government if it’s
dissed the community for this long?” she said, recalling how some Red
Hook residents unwisely ignored warnings ahead of Sandy. (One can only
imagine the added element of distrust that would come from a
<em><em>drone</em></em> shouting those same warnings at you.). Cahn, of
STOP, was also skeptical of the message’s delivery system: “The idea
that you’re going to warn people with a fleet of drones is ludicrous.
It’d take hundreds of thousands of drones operating throughout the day
to reach the number of people that [NYCEM] can reach through a single
text message,” he told me.
</p>
<p>
That problem of scale is also true <em><em>after</em></em> a storm.
While I was impressed by the drones’ heat-seeking capabilities —
operators could quickly find human actors and mannequins heated to
lifelike temperatures during the Staten Island drill — the NYPD
<a href="https://www.police1.com/tech-pulse/nypd-to-start-drone-as-first-responder-program-allowing-uavs-to-respond-to-scenes-of-shootings" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>only
had 85 drones</u></a> in its arsenal as of this spring. Because
connectivity issues are common after major weather disasters, drones
cannot travel terribly far from human-toted hotspots, meaning the actual
ground drones can cover to look for stranded, trapped, hurt, or drowning
New Yorkers is relatively small. Drones also have a limited battery life
of about half an hour and must repeatedly return to handlers to have
their batteries swapped out as they conduct searches.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it seems almost as if the city government is creating problems
for drones to solve. A scenario where a window-breaching drone would be
more beneficial than having a firefighter simply walk into a building
feels like an edge case, and while a drone can inform someone in
Mandarin that help is on the way, that “help” still ultimately takes the
form of human paramedics, police, or firefighters. Font told me that
drones helped supplement the rescue of “multiple drowning victims” in
the Rockaways this summer by providing an extra vantage, but the systems
were only deployed in the first place because of
<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-treading-water-as-lifeguard-shortage-lingers-for-another-summer" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>an
unresolved lifeguard shortage</u></a>. (Though there was excited chatter
at the Staten Island drill about drones one day being able to tow
distressed swimmers to shore, currently they can only bonk you with a
hotdog-sized floatation device that inflates to three feet long to buy
first responders some extra time — and that’s <em><em>if</em></em> you
manage to grab ahold of it while flailing about in rough waters.)
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the biggest problem the drone exercise appeared poised to
address was concerns about whether the city government could continue to
function adequately under Adams’ leadership. Though the drill had
reportedly been in the works for six months,
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/nyregion/eric-adams-investigations.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>mounting
scandals</u></a> and
<a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2024/10/who-has-left-adams-administration/399800/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>resignations</u></a>
in the administration made the large-scale demonstration of interagency
cooperation conveniently timed. On Monday, less than a week after the
drill, Phil Banks — the deputy mayor for public safety whose
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/nyregion/phil-banks-resigns-eric-adams.html" target="_blank"><u>phone
was seized last month</u></a> as part of a federal bribery investigation
— resigned. His departure leaves a gaping hole in the office that is
<a href="https://a856-gbol.nyc.gov/GBOLWebsite/GreenBook/Details?orgId=7560" target="_blank"><u>tasked
with</u></a> coordinating the agencies involved in an extreme weather
response, including directly overseeing NYCEM and the FDNY. (Banks
<a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2024/10/07/philip-banks-resigned-eric-adams/" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a>
was also at the forefront of promoting the city’s use of “high-tech
devices, including drones.)
</p>
<p>
<span></span>When I asked Iscol — who has
<a href="https://x.com/zachiscol/status/1838336960512881149" target="_blank"><u>publicly
admitted</u></a> to having had his own conversations about leaving the
administration due to the ongoing turmoil — during the drill
(i.e. before Banks resigned) whether he was confident that there could
still be smooth operations between City Hall and its agencies in the
event of a near-term disaster, he told me firmly that he was. “There are
300,000 people that work for the city of New York, and they’re showing
up every day,” he told me. “It’s our job to show up and make sure they
have the resources and support and the guidance and direction they need
to be successful to deliver for New Yorkers.” He emphasized that “it’s
business as usual for the agencies,” despite how things look in the
headlines.
</p>
<p>
As for the drones, the commissioner seemed clear-eyed in assessing their
usefulness. “As you do things that are new and for the first time, it’s
an evolution — you’re always improving,” he told me. Drone advancements
are “iterative, kind of like an iPhone,” and he’s aware they’re not all
the way there yet. But “it’s not like we’re <em><em>only</em></em> using
drones,” he stressed. “We’re still taking a multi-channel approach.”
</p>
<p>
Concerned onlookers will often approach Font, the interagency
coordinator, to ask if he’s spying on them when they notice him flying a
drone. He told me that he is always eager to show regular New Yorkers
how the city is using the technology: “We’re a bunch of tech guys, so we
really love getting into the nuts and bolts of it,” he said.
</p>
<p>
He expects, though, that eventually the questions and suspicious looks
will start to taper off. The NYPD and FDNY already use drones in their
everyday operations throughout the city; companies like Amazon have also
started exploring the use of drones to deliver packages. Drones will
become increasingly commonplace as the years wear on. Boring, even! So
<em><em>of course</em></em> they’ll be used during extreme weather
events, too.
</p>
<p>
“This is the world we live in now,” he said.

The IRA, President Biden’s landmark climate law, provides tax credits
for renewable energy and carbon capture projects, including many that
these oil giants have heavily invested in. According to the

Occidental Petroleum have been in discussions with the Trump campaign
and congressional allies to make the case for the law, which Trump has
called the “Green New Scam” and vowed to roll back. Political
strategists told the <em><em>Journal</em></em> that Trump may try to

among environmentalists that Mexico could ramp up climate action.
Sheinbaum made many promises during her campaign but analysts have been
skeptical of their staying power because she also promised to carry on
the legacy of her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who doubled
down on fossil fuels. But the strong words during Sheinbaum’s first

But in some places, like the Horn of Africa, the Philippines, and the

drought in some places and extreme flooding in others – were reflected

court sentences 72-year-old American to nearly 7 years in prison for
fighting in Ukraine</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MOSCOW — A Russian court on Monday sentenced a 72-year-old American
in a closed trial to nearly seven years in prison for allegedly fighting
as a mercenary in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said Stephen Hubbard signed a contract with the Ukrainian
military after Russia sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and he
fought alongside them until being captured two months later. </p>
<p>He was sentenced to six years and 10 months in a general-security
prison. Prosecutors had called for a sentence of seven years in a
maximum-security prison. </p>
<p>Hubbard, from the state of Michigan, is the first American known to
have been convicted on charges of fighting as a mercenary in the
Ukrainian conflict. </p>
<p>The charges carried a potential sentence of 15 years, but prosecutors
asked that his age be taken into account along with his admission of
guilt, Russian news reports said. </p>
<p>Arrests of Americans have become increasingly common in Russia in
recent years. Concern has risen that Russia could be targeting U.S.
nationals for arrest to use later as bargaining chips in talks to bring
back Russians convicted of crimes in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>Also on Monday, a court in the city of Voronezh sentenced American
Robert Gilman to seven years and 1 month for allegedly assaulting law
enforcement officers while serving a sentence for another assault. </p>
<p>According to Russian news reports, Gilman was arrested in 2022 for
causing a disturbance while intoxicated on a passenger train and then
assaulted a police officer while in custody. He is serving a 3 1/2-year
sentence on that charge. </p>
<p>Last year, he assaulted a prison inspector during a cell check, then
hit an official of the Investigative Committee, resulting in the new
sentence, state news agency RIA-Novosti said. </p>
<p>The U.S. and Russia in August completed their largest prisoner swap
in post-Soviet history, a deal involving 24 people, many months of
negotiations and concessions from other European countries, which
released Russians in their custody as part of the exchange. Several U.S.
citizens remain behind bars in Russia following the swap.</p>

Supreme Court taking the bench with ghost guns, a capital case and
transgender rights on the docket</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The U.S Supreme Court is taking the bench again on
Monday, ready to hear cases on ghost guns, a death sentence and
transgender rights.</p>
<p>The docket doesn’t have quite as many blockbuster cases as it did
last term, when its rulings included an opinion granting broad immunity
to former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Still, it’s possible that the conservative-majority court could yet
be asked to intervene in election disputes after the ballots are cast in
November.</p>
<p>The justices also stayed relatively busy during their summer break.
The orders they issued on emergency appeals included a refusal to
restore President Joe Biden’s student loan plan and a partial approval
of an Arizona law requiring proof of citizenship to vote.</p>
<p>The new term also opens against the backdrop of low public trust in
the Supreme Court, and continued debate about whether their newly
adopted code of ethics should have an enforcement mechanism.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at some of the cases coming up:</p>
<p>Ghost gun regulations</p>
<p>The justices will hear a case Tuesday on regulations for ghost guns,
privately made weapons that are hard for police to track because they
don’t have a serial number.</p>
<p>The number of the firearms found at crime scenes has soared in recent
years, from fewer than 4,000 in 2018 to nearly 20,000 recovered by law
enforcement in 2021, according to Justice Department data.</p>
<p>The numbers have been declining in multiple cities since the Biden
administration began requiring background checks and age verification
for ghost gun kits that can be bought online.</p>
<p>But manufacturers and gun rights groups argue that the administration
overstepped and the rule should be overturned.</p>
<p>Doubts about a death sentence</p>
<p>In the decades since Richard Glossip was sentenced to die over a 1997
murder-for-hire scheme, the case has become a rare one where prosecutors
are conceding mistakes.</p>
<p>Oklahoma’s Republican attorney general has joined with Glossip in
seeking to overturn his murder conviction and death sentence.</p>
<p>Despite those doubts, an Oklahoma appeals court has upheld Glossip’s
conviction, and the state’s pardon and parole board deadlocked in a vote
to grant him clemency.</p>
<p>The court will hear arguments in his case on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Transgender rights</p>
<p>Perhaps the court’s most closely watched case so far this year is a
fight over transgender rights.</p>
<p>The case over state bans on gender-affirming care comes as
Republican-led states enact a variety of restrictions, including school
sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows.</p>
<p>The administration and Democratic-led states have extended
protections for transgender people, though Supreme Court has separately
prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation
that seeks to protect transgender students.</p>
<p>The justices will weigh a Tennessee law that restrict puberty
blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. The case does not
yet have a hearing date, but will likely be argued in December.</p>

id="nobel-prize-in-medicine-honors-american-duo-for-their-discovery-of-microrna">Nobel
Prize in medicine honors American duo for their discovery of
microRNA</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM — The Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine was awarded
Monday to Americans Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of
microRNA, tiny pieces of genetic material that alter how genes work at
the cellular level and could lead to new ways of treating cancer. </p>
<p>The Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, which awarded the
prize, said the duo’s discovery is “proving to be fundamentally
important” in understanding how organisms develop and function. </p>
<p>MicroRNA have opened up scientists’ approaches to treating diseases
like cancer by helping to regulate how genes work at the cellular level,
according to Dr. Claire Fletcher, a lecturer in molecular oncology at
Imperial College London. </p>
<p>Fletcher said microRNA provide genetic instructions to tell cells to
make new proteins and that there were two main areas where microRNA
could be helpful: in developing drugs to treat diseases and in serving
as biomarkers. </p>
<p>“MicroRNA alters how genes in the cell work,” said Fletcher, who is
an outside expert not associated with the Nobel prize. </p>
<p>“If we take the example of cancer, we’ll have a particular gene
working overtime, it might be mutated and working in overdrive,” she
said. “We can take a microRNA that we know alters the activity of that
gene and we can deliver that particular microRNA to cancer cells to stop
that mutated gene from having its effect.” </p>
<p>Ambros performed the research that led to his prize at Harvard
University. He is currently a professor of natural science at the
University of Massachusetts Medical School. Ruvkun’s research was
performed at Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Medical
School, where he’s a professor of genetics, said Thomas Perlmann,
Secretary-General of the Nobel Committee. </p>
<p>Perlmann said he spoke to Ruvkun by phone shortly before the
announcement. </p>
<p>“It took a long time before he came to the phone and sounded very
tired, but he quite rapidly was quite excited and happy, when he
understood what it was all about,” Perlmann said. </p>
<p>Last year, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to
Hungarian-American Katalin Karikó and American Drew Weissman for
discoveries that enabled the creation of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19
that were critical in slowing the pandemic. </p>
<p>The prize carries a cash award of ($1 million from a bequest left by
the prize’s creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. </p>
<p>The announcement launched this year’s Nobel prizes award season. </p>
<p>Nobel announcements continue with the physics prize on Tuesday,
chemistry on Wednesday and literature on Thursday. The Nobel Peace Prize
will be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic
Sciences on Oct. 14. </p>
<p>The laureates are invited to receive their awards at ceremonies on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death. </p>
<p>Fletcher said there are clinical trials ongoing to see how microRNA
approaches might help treat skin cancer, but that there aren’t yet any
drug treatments approved by drug regulators. She expected that might
happen in the next five to 10 years. </p>
<p>She said microRNA represent another way of being able to control the
behavior of genes to treat and track various diseases. </p>
<p>“The majority of therapies we have at the moment are targeting
proteins in cells,” she said. “If we can intervene at the microRNA
level, it opens up a whole new way of us developing medicines and us
controlling the activity of genes whose levels might be altered in
diseases.”</p>

<h2 id="macos-15.0-now-unix-03-certified">macOS 15.0 now UNIX
03-certified</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>You have to wonder how meaningful this news is in 2024, but macOS
15.0 Sequoia running on either Apple Silicon or Intel processors is now
UNIX 03-certified. The UNIX 03 Product Standard is the mark for systems
conforming to Version 3 of the Single UNIX Specification. It is a
significantly enhanced version of the UNIX 98 Product Standard. The
mandatory enhancements include alignment with ISO/IEC 9989:1999 C
Programming Language, IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 and ISO/IEC 9945:2002. This
Product Standard includes the following mandatory Product
Standards: Internationalized System Calls and Libraries Extended
V3,Commands and Utilities V4, C Language V2, and Internationalized
Terminal Interfaces. ↫ UNIX 03 page The questionable usefulness of this
news stems from a variety of factors. The UNIX 03 specification hails
from the before time of 2002, when UNIX-proper still had some footholds
in the market and being a UNIX meant something to the industry. These
days, Linux has pretty much taken over the traditional UNIX market, and
UNIX certification seems to have all but lost its value. Only one
operating system can boast to conform to the latest UNIX specification –
AIX is UNIX V7 and 03-certified – while macOS and HP-UX are only UNIX
03-certified. OpenWare, UnixWare, and z/OS only conform to even older
standards. On top of all this, it seems being UNIX-certified by The Open
Group feels a lot like a pay-to-play scheme, making it unlikely that
community efforts like, say, FreeBSD, Debian, or similarly popular
server operating systems could ever achieve UNIX-certification even if
they wanted to. This makes the whole UNIX-certification world feel more
like the dying vestiges of a job security program than something
meaningful for an operating system to aspire to. In any even, you can
now write a program that compiles and runs on all two UNIX 03-certified
operating systems, as long as it only uses POSIX APIs.</p>

<h2 id="lost-1983-programming-language-bought-on-ebay">“Lost” 1983
programming language bought on eBay</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: OS News</p>
<p>A YouTube channel has resurrected a programming language that hadn’t
been seen since the 1980s — in a testament to both the enduring power of
our technology, and of the communities that care about it. But best of
all, Simpson uploaded the language to the Internet Archive, along with
all his support materials, inviting his viewers to write their own
programs (and saying he hoped his upstairs neighbor would’ve approved).
And in our email interview, Simpson said since then it’s already been
downloaded over 1,000 times — “which is pretty amazing for something so
old.” ↫ David Cassel It’s great that this lost programming language,
MicroText for the Commodore 64, was rediscovered, but I’m a bit confused
as to how “lost” this language really was. I mean, it was “discovered”
in a properly listed eBay listing, which feels like cheating to me. When
I think of stories of discoveries of long-lost software, games, or
media, it usually involves things like finding it in a shed after years
of searching, or someone at a company going through that box of old hard
drives discovering the game they worked on 32 years ago. I don’t know,
something about this whole story feels off to me, and it’s ringing some
alarm bells I can’t quite place. Regardless, it’s cool to have MicroText
readily available on the web now, so that people can rediscover it and
create awesome new things with it. Perhaps there’s old ideas to be
relearned here.</p>

<h2 id="gsoc-2024-3-way-comparison-intrinsics">GSoC 2024: 3-way
comparison intrinsics</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-07, from: LLVM Blog</p>
<p>
Hello everyone! My name is Volodymyr, and in this post I would like to
talk about the project I have been working on for the past couple of
months as part of Google Summer of Code 2024. The aim of the project was
to introduce 3-way comparison intrinsics to LLVM IR and add a decent
level of optimizations for them.
</p>
<h1 id="background">
Background
</h1>
<p>
Three-way comparison is an operation present in many high-level
languages, such as C++ and its spaceship operator or Rust and the
<code>Ord</code> trait. It operates on two values for which there is a
defined comparison operation and returns <code>-1</code> if the first
operand is less than the second, <code>0</code> if they are equal, and
<code>1</code> otherwise. At the moment, compilers that use LLVM express
this operation using different sequences of instructions which are
optimized and lowered individually rather than as a single operation.
Adding an intrinsic for this operation would therefore help us generate
better machine code on some targets, as well as potentially optimize
patterns in the middle-end that we didn’t optimize before.
</p>
<h1 id="what-was-done">
What was done
</h1>
<p>
Over the course of the project I have added two new intrinsics to the
LLVM IR: <code>llvm.ucmp</code> for an unsigned 3-way comparison and
<code>llvm.scmp</code> for a signed comparison. They both take two
arguments that must be integers or vectors of integers and return an
integer or a vector of integers with the same number of elements. The
arguments and the result do not need to have the same type.
</p>
<p>
In the middle-end the following passes received some support for these
intrinsics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
InstSimplify
(<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/93730">#1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/95601">#2</a>)
</li>
<li>
InstCombine
(<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/96118">#1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/98360">#2</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/101049">#3</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/105272">#4</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/105583">#5</a>)
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/97235">CorrelatedValuePropagation</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/97974">ConstraintElimination</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I have also added folds of idiomatic ways that a 3-way comparison can be
expressed to a call to the corresponding intrinsic.
</p>
<p>
In the backend there are two different ways of expanding the intrinsics:
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/91871">as a nested
select</a> (i.e. <code>(x &lt; y) ? -1 : (x &gt; y ? 1 : 0)</code>) or
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/98774">as a
subtraction of zero-extended comparisons</a> (<code>zext(x &gt; y) -
zext(x &lt; y)</code>). The second option is the default one, but
targets can choose to use the first one through a TLI hook.
</p>
<h1 id="results">
Results
</h1>
<p>
I think that overall the project was successful and brought a small
positive change to LLVM. To demonstrate its impact in a small test case,
the following function in C++ that uses the spaceship operator was
compiled twice, first with Clang 18.1 and then with Clang built from the
main branch of LLVM repository:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-C++" data-lang="C++"><span style="color:#75715e">#include</span> <span style="color:#75715e">&lt;compare&gt;</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>std<span style="color:#f92672">::</span>strong_ordering cmp(<span style="color:#66d9ef">unsigned</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> a, <span style="color:#66d9ef">unsigned</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> b){ <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> a <span style="color:#f92672">&lt;=&gt;</span> b;}</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
With Clang 18.1:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">; ====== LLVM IR ======define i8 @cmp(i32 %a, i32 %b) {entry: %cmp.lt = icmp ult i32 %a, %b %sel.lt = select i1 %cmp.lt, i8 -1, i8 1 %cmp.eq = icmp eq i32 %a, %b %sel.eq = select i1 %cmp.eq, i8 0, i8 %sel.lt ret i8 %sel.eq}; ====== x86_64 assembly ======cmp: xor ecx, ecx cmp edi, esi mov eax, 0 sbb eax, eax or al, 1 cmp edi, esi movzx eax, al cmove eax, ecx ret</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
With freshly built Clang:
</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plain" data-lang="plain">; ====== LLVM IR ======define i8 @cmp(i32 %a, i32 %b) {entry: %sel.eq = tail call i8 @llvm.ucmp.i8.i32(i32 %a, i32 %b) ret i8 %sel.eq}; ====== x86_64 assembly ======cmp: cmp edi, esi seta al sbb al, 0 ret</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
As you can see, the number of instructions in the generated code had
gone down considerably (from 8 to 3 excluding <code>ret</code>).
Although this isn’t much and is a small synthetic test, it can still
make a noticeable impact if code like this is found in a hot path
somewhere.
</p>
<p>
The impact of these changes on real-world code is much harder to
quantify. Looking at llvm-opt-benchmark, there are quite a few places
where the intrinsics are being used, which suggests that some
improvement must have taken place, although it is unlikely to be
significant in all but very few cases.
</p>
<h1 id="future-work">
Future Work
</h1>
<p>
There are still many opportunities for optimization in the middle-end,
some of which are already known and being worked on at the time of
writing this, others are yet to be discovered. I would also like to
allow pointers and vectors of pointers to be valid operands for the
intrinsics, although that would be quite a minor change. In the backend
I would also like to work on better handling of intrinsics in
GlobalISel, which is something that I didn’t have enough time for and
other members of LLVM community had helped me with.
