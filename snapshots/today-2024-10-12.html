Horrible, Very Bad Year</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, updated: 2024-10-12, from: RAND blog</p>
<p>Iran was in a stronger strategic position before its proxies plunged
the region into war. But it has only itself to blame. If Tehran is
intent on escalating, the United States and its allies may have no other
choice but to shift from punitive measures to dismantling Iran’s
military capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="harris-doctor-reports-shes-in-excellent-health">Harris’ doctor
reports she’s in ‘excellent health’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is in “excellent
health” and “possesses the physical and mental resiliency” required to
serve as president, her doctor said in a letter released Saturday that
summarizes her medical history and status.</p>
<p>Dr. Joshua Simmons, a U.S. Army colonel and physician to the vice
president, wrote that Harris, 59, maintains a healthy, active lifestyle
and that her most recent physical, in April, was “unremarkable.”</p>
<p>She “possesses the physical and mental resiliency required to
successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as
Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief,” he wrote in a
two-page letter.</p>
<p>Harris’ campaign hopes to use the moment to draw a contrast with
Republican Donald Trump, who has released only limited information about
his health over the years, and raise questions about his fitness to
serve, according to a campaign aide who spoke on condition of anonymity
to discuss sensitive matters.</p>
<p>Trump has released very little health information, including after
his ear was grazed by a bullet during an assassination attempt in
July.</p>
<p>Simmons, who said he has been Harris’ primary care physician for the
past 3½ years, said the vice president has a history of allergies and
urticaria, also known as hives, for which she has been on allergen
immunotherapy for the past three years.</p>
<p>Simmons said Harris’ latest blood work and other test results were
“unremarkable.”</p>
<p>Also in the report: Harris wears contact lenses for mild
nearsightedness; her family history includes maternal colon cancer; she
is up to date on preventive care recommendations, including having a
colonoscopy and annual mammograms.</p>
<p>As Harris’ office released the medical report, her campaign
highlighted recent media reports raising questions about Trump’s health
and mental acuity and his failure to provide information about health
status and medical history.</p>
<p>Trump, 78, eagerly questioned President Joe Biden’s health when the
81-year-old president was seeking reelection. Since Biden was replaced
on the ticket with Harris, Trump’s own health has drawn more
attention.</p>
<p>Last November, Trump marked Biden’s birthday by releasing a letter
from his physician that reported the former president was in “excellent”
physical and mental health.</p>
<p>The letter, posted on Trump’s social media platform, contained no
details to support its claims — measures such as weight, blood pressure
and cholesterol levels, or the results of any test.</p>

airstrikes target multiple militant camps in Syria</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BEIRUT — A series of U.S. airstrikes targeted several camps run by
the Islamic State group in Syria in an operation the U.S. military said
will disrupt the extremists from conducting attacks in the region and
beyond.</p>
<p>The U.S. Central Command said the airstrikes were conducted Friday,
without specifying in which parts of Syria. About 900 U.S. troops have
been deployed in eastern Syria alongside the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led
Syrian Democratic Forces that were instrumental in the fight against IS
militants.</p>
<p>Despite their defeat, attacks by IS sleeper cells in Iraq and Syria
have been on the rise over the past years, with scores of people killed
or wounded.</p>
<p>The Islamic State group seized territory at the height of its power
and declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 but
was defeated in Iraq in 2017. In March 2019, the extremists lost the
last sliver of land they once controlled in eastern Syria.</p>
<p>The U.S. military said the strikes will disrupt the ability of the
Islamic State group to plan, organize and conduct attacks against the
United States, its allies and partners, as well as civilians throughout
the region and beyond.</p>
<p>It said battle damage assessments were underway and there were no
civilian casualties.</p>
<p>Last month, Iraq’s military said that Iraqi forces and American
troops killed a senior IS commander who was wanted by the United States,
as well as several other prominent militants.</p>
<p>At its peak, the group ruled an area half the size of the United
Kingdom where it enforced its extreme interpretation of Islam, which
included attacks on religious minority groups and harsh punishment of
Muslims deemed to be apostates.</p>

One of the features of using a custom email address with every service

parties. Today’s inbox let me know it’s time to shut down my Macy’s

Selling off customer data for reasons other than partnering or targeted

id="animal-lovers-try-to-counter-the-deadly-risk-of-chicago-high-rises-for-migrating-birds">Animal
lovers try to counter the deadly risk of Chicago high-rises for
migrating birds</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>chicago — With a neon-green net in hand, Annette Prince briskly walks
a downtown Chicago plaza at dawn, looking left and right as she
goes.</p>
<p>It’s not long before she spots a tiny yellow bird sitting on the
concrete. It doesn’t fly away, and she quickly nets the bird, gently
places it inside a paper bag and labels the bag with the date, time and
place.</p>
<p>“This is a Nashville warbler,” said Prince, director of the Chicago
Bird Collision Monitors, noting that the bird must have flown into a
glass window pane of an adjacent building. “He must only weigh about two
pennies. He’s squinting his eyes because his head hurts.”</p>
<p>For rescue groups like the Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, this
scene plays out hundreds of times each spring and fall after migrating
birds fly into homes, small buildings and sometimes Chicago’s
skyscrapers and other hulking buildings.</p>
<p>A stark sign of the risks came last fall, when 1,000 migrating birds
died on a single night after flying into the glass exterior of the
city’s lakefront convention center, McCormick Place. This fall, the
facility unveiled new bird-safe window film on one of its glass
buildings along the Lake Michigan shore.</p>
<p>The $1.2 million project installed tiny dots on the exterior of the
Lakeside Center building, adorning enough glass to cover two football
fields.</p>
<p>Doug Stotz, senior conservation ecologist at the nearby Field Museum,
hopes the project will be a success. He estimated that just 20 birds
have died after flying into the convention’s center’s glass exterior so
far this fall, a hopeful sign.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a lot of data since this just started this fall, but
at this point, it looks like it’s made a huge difference,” Stotz
said.</p>
<p>But for the birds that collide with Chicago buildings, there is a
network of people waiting to help. They also are aiming to educate
officials and find solutions to improve building design, lighting and
other factors in the massive number of bird collision deaths in Chicago
and worldwide.</p>
<p>Prince said she and other volunteers walk the streets downtown to
document what they can of the birds that are killed and injured.</p>
<p>“We have the combination of the millions of birds that pass through
this area because it’s a major migratory path through the United States,
on top of the amount of artificial lighting that we put out at night,
which is when these birds are traveling and getting confused and
attracted to the amount of glass,” Prince said.</p>
<p>Dead birds are often saved for scientific use, including by Chicago’s
Field Museum of Natural History. Rescued birds are taken to local
wildlife rehabilitation centers to recover, such as the DuPage Wildlife
Conservation Center in suburban Illinois.</p>
<p>On a recent morning, veterinarian Darcy Stephenson at DuPage gave a
yellow-bellied sapsucker anesthetic gas before taping its wings open for
an X-ray. The bird arrived with a note from a rescue group: “Window
collision.”</p>
<p>Examining the results, she found the bird had a broken ulna — a bone
in the wing.</p>
<p>The center takes in about 10,000 species of animals annually and 65%
of them are avian. Many are victims of window collisions and during peak
migration in the fall, several hundred birds can show up in one day.</p>
<p>“The large chunk of these birds do actually survive and make it back
into the wild once we’re able to treat them,” said Sarah Reich, head
veterinarian at DuPage. “Fractures heal very, very quickly in these guys
for shoulder fractures. Soft tissue trauma generally heals pretty well.
The challenging cases are going to be the ones where the trauma isn’t as
apparent.”</p>
<p>Injured birds go through a process of flight testing, then get a full
physical exam by the veterinary staff and are rehabilitated before being
set free.</p>
<p>“It’s exciting to be able to get these guys back out into the wild,
especially some of those cases that we’re kind of cautiously optimistic
about or maybe have an injury that we’ve never treated successfully
before,” Reich said, adding that these are the cases “clinic staff get
really, really excited about.”</p>

id="louisianas-cajun-and-creole-heritage-will-be-celebrated-at-50th-annual-festival">Louisiana’s
Cajun and Creole heritage will be celebrated at 50th annual
festival</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>new orleans, louisiana — Louisiana’s Cajun and Creole heritage takes
center stage this weekend when the Festivals Acadiens et Creoles marks a
half-century of honoring and celebrating the culture through music,
arts, food and community. </p>
<p>What started as a one day concert in 1974 to entertain 150
French-speaking journalists gathered in Lafayette — considered the heart
of Cajun country — has grown into a three-day event and possibly one of
the largest Cajun and Zydeco festivals in the world, organizers said.
And, they note, the entire event is free. </p>
<p>Barry Jean Ancelet, one of the event’s organizers, said when the idea
formed 50 years ago, nobody knew if anyone would even come to hear the
music. </p>
<p>“Cajun music at that time was largely considered ‘old people’s
music,’” he said. “You’ve got to remember, we were in the throes of Rock
‘n’ Roll at the time. The people here loved it when they encountered it
in dance halls, but this concert was designed to call attention to the
music in a different way, to point out its value. They had to sit — not
dance — and pay attention. And they ended up hearing it in a different
way. It was so successful. We ended up turning it into an annual event
where we could call positive attention to this important asset and get
people to consider it.” </p>
<p>The festival, now held annually in Lafayette’s Girard Park, brings
together multi-generations of musicians and artists who annually fight
to preserve a culture that continues to evolve. </p>
<p>“We’ve always been about celebrating the past and handing it off to
the future,” Ancelet said. “If you value and respect evolution, the
culture will produce things that will continue to surprise you. It all
comes out in the wash. What’s good will last and what’s not,
won’t.” </p>
<p>Festival co-founder Pat Mould said the festival is a
“self-celebration of who we are, how we live, what we eat, the music and
how we speak.” </p>
<p>“If you know nothing and want to learn about the culture, this one
weekend out of the year allows you to find out everything. Everything
you want to know is represented at the festival. It’s a quick study of
Cajun and Creole living,” he said. </p>
<p>Event features homegrown talent</p>
<p>On tap musically for the Friday through Sunday event are performances
by 60 musicians — all homegrown talent — including Steve Riley and the
Mamou Playboys, Wayne Toups, CJ Chenier, Nathan and the Zydeco Cha Chas,
Chubby Carrier and the Bayou Swamp Band, The Revelers, Beausoleil avec
Michael Doucet and The Lost Bayou Ramblers. </p>
<p>On Friday, contemporary artists will pay tribute to the 1974 concert
house band that included Zydeco pioneer Clifton Chenier, Cajun accordion
maker Marc Savoy, the Balfa Brothers, a Cajun music ensemble of five
brothers, Cajun accordion players Nathan Abshire and Blackie Forrester,
and Jimmy C. Newman, a country music and Cajun singer-songwriter and
long-time star of the Grand Ole Opry. </p>
<p>“Get ready for Louisiana pure fun,” said Carrier, who’s scheduled to
perform with his band on Sunday. “Get ready to eat some really good food
and have the time of your life.” </p>
<p>“People all over the word have these dates circled on their
calendar,” he continued. “It’s an event that helps the younger
generations continue the traditions. I’m a third generation Zydeco
musician. This is a family oriented festival that brings people together
of all ages.” </p>
<p>A ‘celebration of everything Cajun’</p>
<p>Riley, who’s been performing at this festival since 1988, said he
keeps returning for several reasons but especially because it helps
preserve the culture. </p>
<p>“It’s important to see us on stage, singing and speaking in French.
That has an effect on people who come to see us and helps them fall in
love with the culture,” he said. </p>
<p>“There are a lot of events leading up to the weekend that focuses on
the importance of the language, the culture, the food and, of course,
the music. There’s none other that celebrates it like this one. I think
it’s the biggest complete celebration of everything Cajun. It’s also
inclusive of different generations, bands with lineage. That’s key,” he
said. </p>
<p>Riley, now 55, said he’s very proud that his three children play
music. </p>
<p>“It’s a beautiful thing for my family and others like mine,” he said.
“Having your kids play with you is awesome. Most kids don’t want to have
anything to do with what their parents do. Mine think what I do is fun
and it is.” </p>
<p>Riley said when he first started there weren’t too many young bands
playing Cajun music. </p>
<p>“There was real fear that the music would die off and dissipate like
the language,” he said. “The opposite has happened. More young folks are
preserving and playing this music than ever. The Zydeco scene down here
is packed with young people. It’s super vibrant and alive. The same with
the Cajun scene as well.”</p>

id="nazi-looted-monet-artwork-returned-to-family-generations-later">Nazi-looted
Monet artwork returned to family generations later</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — On the eve of World War II, Nazis in Austria seized a
pastel by renowned impressionist artist Claude Monet, selling it off and
sparking a family’s decadeslong search that culminated Wednesday in New
Orleans.</p>
<p>At an FBI field office, agents lifted a blue veil covering the Monet
pastel and presented Adalbert Parlagi’s granddaughters with the artwork
over 80 years after it was taken from their family. Helen Lowe said she
felt that her grandfather would be watching and that he would be “so, so
proud of this moment.”</p>
<p>Monet’s 1865 Bord de Mer depicts rocks along the shoreline of the
Normandy coast, where Allied forces stormed the beaches of Nazi-occupied
France during D-Day in 1944, marking a turning point in the war. The
Monet pastel is one of 20,000 items recovered by the FBI Art Crime Team
out of an estimated 600,000 artworks and millions of books and religious
objects stolen by the Nazis.</p>
<p>“The theft was not random or incidental, but an integral part of the
Nazis’ plan to eliminate all vestiges of Jewish life in Germany and
Europe, root and branch,” U.S. State Department Holocaust adviser Stuart
E. Eizenstat said in a March speech.</p>
<p>After Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Adalbert Parlagi, a
successful businessman and art lover, and his wife, Hilda, left behind
almost everything they owned and fled Vienna, using British license
plates to drive across the border, their granddaughters said. Though the
Parlagis hadn’t identified as Jewish for years and baptized their
children as Protestants, they were still considered Jewish under Nazi
laws, according to Austrian government records. Other relatives were
killed in concentration camps.</p>
<p>The Parlagis attempted to ship their valuable carpets, porcelain and
artworks out of Vienna to London, but found out later that their
property had been seized and auctioned off by the Gestapo to support the
Third Reich.</p>
<p>Multiple international declarations decried trading in Nazi-looted
art, beginning with Allied forces in London in 1943. The 1998 Washington
principles, signed by more than three dozen countries, reiterated the
call and advocated for the return of stolen art.</p>
<p>Yet Adalbert Parlagi’s efforts were stonewalled by the Vienna
auctioneer who had bought and sold the Monet pastel and another artwork
owned by Parlagi. The records were lost after the fighting in Vienna,
the auctioneer told Adalbert in a letter shortly after World War II,
according to an English translation of a document prepared by an
Austrian government body reviewing the Parlagi family’s art restitution
claims.</p>
<p>“I also cannot remember two such pictures either,” the auctioneer
said.</p>
<p>Many survivors of World War II and their descendants ultimately give
up trying to recover their lost artwork because of the difficulties they
face, said Anne Webber, co-founder of the London-based nonprofit
Commission for Looted Art in Europe, which has recovered more than 3,500
looted artworks.</p>
<p>“You have to just constantly, constantly, constantly look,” Webber
said.</p>
<p>Adalbert Parlagi and his son Franz kept meticulous ownership and
search records. After Franz’s death in 2012, Françoise Parlagi stumbled
upon her father’s cache of documents, including the original receipt
from her grandfather’s purchase of the Monet pastel. She reached out to
Webber’s commission for help in 2014.</p>
<p>The commission’s research team reviewed archives and receipts,
contacted museums and art experts and scoured the internet, but
initially found “absolutely no trace,” Webber said. Then, in 2021, the
team discovered online that a New Orleans dealer acquired the Monet in
2017 and sold it to a Louisiana-based doctor and his wife.</p>
<p>The FBI investigated the commission’s research and, earlier this
year, a federal court ruled the pastel should be returned to the
Parlagis’ descendants.</p>
<p>“There was never a question” of returning the art to the rightful
owners after learning of its sordid history, said Bridget Vita-Schlamp,
whose late husband had purchased the Monet pastel.</p>
<p>“We were shocked, I’m not going to lie,” she said.</p>
<p>The family recovered another work in March from the Austrian
government but there are still six more artworks missing, including from
acclaimed artists Camille Pissarro and Paul Signac. The U.S. is likely
the “largest illegal art market in the world,” said Kristin Koch,
supervisory special agent with the FBI’s Art Crime Program.</p>
<p>The art world has a greater responsibility to investigate the origins
of artworks and a moral obligation to return looted works to their
rightful owners, Webber said.</p>
<p>“They represent the life and the lives that were taken,” Webber said.
“They represent the world that they were exiled from.”</p>
<p>The granddaughters of Adalbert and Hilda Parlagi say they are
grateful for what they have already gotten back. Françoise Parlagi, a
broad smile on her face, said she hoped to hang a copy of the pastel in
her home. She said the moment felt “unreal.”</p>
<p>“So many families are in this situation. Maybe they haven’t even been
trying to recover because they don’t believe, they think this might not
be possible,” she said. “Let us be hope for other families.”</p>

voting systems, targets of conspiracy theories, get tested for accuracy,
security</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ATLANTA — Voting machines have been at the center of a web of
conspiracy theories after the 2020 U.S. election, with false claims that
they were manipulated to steal the presidency from Donald Trump.</p>
<p>There was no evidence of widespread fraud or rigged voting machines
in the election, and multiple reviews in the battleground states where
the Republican president disputed his loss to Democrat Joe Biden
confirmed the results as accurate. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay
Dominion Voting Systems, one of the largest voting machine companies,
$787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit.</p>
<p>In the years since his loss, Trump and his allies have continued to
sow doubts about voting equipment. State and local election officials
have tried to push back by explaining the layers of protection that
surround voting systems and the measures they have in place to conduct
fair and accurate elections.</p>
<p>In November’s presidential election, nearly every ballot cast will
have a paper record that can be used to obtain an accurate count even if
there are errors or cyberattacks.</p>
<p>What is a voting machine?</p>
<p>Election officials rely on various pieces of technology. Every office
does things a little bit differently.</p>
<p>Officials rely on a voter registration system that is a database of
registered voters and have an election management system that workers
use to create, issue and track ballots. They also use an election-night
reporting system that reports unofficial results. Many jurisdictions use
electronic pollbooks to check in voters at polling locations.</p>
<p>All this depends on software and computers, a reliance that carries
risks that officials work to identify and address. For example, election
officials often will isolate critical systems from the internet and use
storage devices, such as secured USB sticks, to transfer data. They
limit access to sensitive equipment to only those who need it and have
logs that track and monitor the devices.</p>
<p>When an internet connection is needed, election officials will often
use private networks to limit the risk of malicious activity and take
other steps to scan their systems for potential vulnerabilities and
threats.</p>
<p>Voters in much of the country fill out ballots by hand, and then that
ballot will be scanned and counted electronically. A few places, mostly
small towns in the Northeast, will count their ballots by hand.</p>
<p>In some areas, voters use a computer to mark their ballots
electronically and then get a printout of their choices that they insert
into a scanner for counting. In other cases, the ballot is cast
electronically, and a paper record is printed that summarizes the votes
cast. That record is then available if a hand count is needed.</p>
<p>Are voting machines connected to the internet?</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, no. There are some jurisdictions in a few
states that allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit
unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has
ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies
have been removed.</p>
<p>Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster
reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the
paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results
during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to
a recount if one was needed.</p>
<p>Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and
should be prohibited.</p>
<p>Are voting machines secure?</p>
<p>Election officials say they have worked extensively to shore up
security around their voting equipment after an effort by Russia to scan
state voter registration systems for vulnerabilities in 2016.</p>
<p>There was no evidence then that any data was changed or deleted, but
it led the federal government to declare the nation’s election systems
as critical infrastructure. That allows the U.S. Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency to provide free cybersecurity reviews and
vulnerability testing to election offices nationwide.</p>
<p>“Today, eight years later, because of all the incredible work by
election officials to strengthen the security and resiliency of our
election process, election infrastructure has never been more secure,
and the election stakeholder community has never been stronger,” the
agency’s director, Jen Easterly, told reporters in September.</p>
<p>Computer security experts have called for more to be done and for
election officials to limit the use of certain technology, specifically
machines that mark ballots for voters. A long-running court battle in
Georgia has sought to compel the state to get rid of these machines in
favor of hand-marked paper ballots.</p>
<p>Experts have also raised particular concern about a series of
security breaches that occurred after the 2020 election as Trump allies
sought access to voting systems in Georgia and elsewhere as they tried
to prove their unsubstantiated claims. The experts have warned that the
public release of critical election software because of the breaches has
raised “serious threats” and have called for a federal
investigation.</p>
<p>How do election officials ensure accuracy?</p>
<p>Election officials say there are safeguards in place to ensure that
voting systems are not manipulated. That begins with physical security,
such as locked rooms with limited access and the use of tamper-evident
seals. In addition, voting equipment is tested before the election, a
process that includes running test ballots through the equipment to
ensure votes are being counted correctly.</p>
<p>Postelection reviews are conducted to identify any mistakes or errors
that may have occurred.</p>
<p>Around 98% of all ballots cast in this year’s election will include a
paper record, according to a report by the Brennan Center for Justice
based on data collected by Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that
tracks voting equipment in the U.S. Officials say that’s important for
ensuring that any error or cyberattack will not prevent officials from
producing an accurate record of the vote.</p>

id="florida-residents-slog-through-aftermath-of-hurricane-milton">Florida
residents slog through aftermath of Hurricane Milton</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LITHIA, Florida — Florida residents slogged through flooded streets,
gathered up scattered debris and assessed damage to their homes on
Friday after Hurricane Milton smashed through coastal communities and
spawned a barrage of deadly tornadoes.</p>
<p>At least 10 people were dead, and rescuers were still saving people
from swollen rivers, but many expressed relief that Milton wasn’t worse.
The hurricane spared densely populated Tampa a direct hit, and the
lethal storm surge that scientists feared never materialized.</p>
<p>Gov. Ron DeSantis warned people to not let down their guard, however,
citing ongoing safety threats including downed power lines and standing
water that could hide dangerous objects.</p>
<p>“We’re now in the period where you have fatalities that are
preventable,” DeSantis said. “You have to make the proper decisions and
know that there are hazards out there.”</p>
<p>As of Friday night, the number of customers in Florida still without
power had dropped to 1.9 million, according to poweroutage.us.
St. Petersburg’s 260,000 residents were told to boil water before
drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth, until at least Monday.</p>
<p>Also Friday, the owner of a major phosphate mine disclosed that
pollution spilled into Tampa Bay during the hurricane.</p>
<p>The Mosaic Company said in a statement that heavy rains from the
storm overwhelmed a collection system at its Riverview site, pushing
excess water out of a manhole and into discharges that lead to the bay.
The company said the leak was fixed Thursday.</p>
<p>Mosaic said the spill likely exceeded a 66,245-liter minimum
reporting standard, though it did not provide a figure for what the
total volume might have been.</p>
<p>Calls and emails to Mosaic seeking additional information about
Riverview and the company’s other Florida mines received no response, as
did a voicemail left with the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection.</p>
<p>The state has 25 such stacks containing more than 1 billion tons of
phosphogypsum, a solid waste byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer
mining industry that contains radium, which decays to form radon gas.
Both radium and radon are radioactive and can cause cancer.
Phosphogypsum may also contain toxic heavy metals and other carcinogens,
such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury and nickel.</p>
<p>Florida’s vital tourism industry has started to return to normal,
meanwhile, as Walt Disney World and other theme parks reopened. The
state’s busiest airport, in Orlando, resumed full operations Friday.</p>
<p>Arriving just two weeks after the devastating Hurricane Helene,
Milton flooded barrier islands, tore the roof off the Tampa Bay Rays ’
baseball stadium and toppled a construction crane.</p>
<p>Crews from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Friday were
assisting with rescues of people, including a 92-year-old woman, who
were stranded in rising waters along the Alafia River. The river is 40
kilometers long and runs from eastern Hillsborough County, east of
Tampa, into Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>In Pinellas County, deputies used high-water vehicles to shuttle
people back and forth to their homes in a flooded Palm Harbor
neighborhood where waters continued to rise.</p>
<p>Ashley Cabrera left with her 18- and 11-year-old sons and their three
dogs, Eeyore, Poe and Molly. It was the first time since Milton struck
that they had been able to leave the neighborhood, and they were now
headed to a hotel in Orlando.</p>
<p>“I’m extremely thankful that we could get out now and go for the
weekend somewhere we can get a hot meal and some gas,” Cabrera said. “I
thought we’d be able to get out as soon as the storm was over. These
roads have never flooded like this in all the years that I’ve lived
here.”</p>
<p>Animals were being saved, too. Cindy Evers helped rescue a large pig
stuck in high water at a strip mall in Lithia, east of Tampa. She had
already rescued a donkey and several goats after the storm.</p>
<p>“I’m high and dry where I’m at, and I have a barn and 9 acres (3.6
hectares),” Evers said, adding that she will soon start to work to find
the animals’ owners.</p>
<p>In the Gulf Coast city of Venice, Milton left behind dozens of
centimeters of sand in some beachfront condos, with one unit nearly
filled. A swimming pool was packed full of sand, with only its handrails
poking out.</p>
<p>Some warnings were heeded and lessons learned. When 2.4 meters of
seawater flooded Punta Gorda during Hurricane Helene last month, 121
people had to be rescued, Mayor Lynne Matthews said. Milton brought at
least 1.5 meters of flooding, but rescuers only had to save three
people.</p>
<p>“So people listened to the evacuation order,” Matthews said.</p>
<p>Heaps of fruit were scattered across the ground and trees toppled
over after both Milton and Hurricane Helene swept through Polk County
and other orange-growing regions, Matt Joyner of trade group Florida
Citrus Mutual said Friday.</p>
<p>Milton arrived at the start of the orange growing season, so it is
still too early to evaluate the full scope of the damage.</p>
<p>Florida has already seen orange production diminish over the years,
with the industry still recovering from hurricanes of years past while
also waging an ongoing battle against a deadly greening disease. Milton
could be the knockout punch for some growers, Joyce said.</p>
<p>In the western coastal city of Clearwater, Kelvin Glenn said it took
less than an hour early Thursday for water to rise to his waist inside
his apartment. He and seven children, ranging in age from 3 to 16, were
trapped in the brown, foul floodwaters for about three hours before an
upstairs neighbor opened their home to them.</p>
<p>Later that day, first responders arrived in boats to ferry them away
from the building.</p>
<p>“Sitting in that cold, nasty water was kind of bad,” Glenn said.</p>
<p>Short-term survival is now turning into long-term worries. A hotel is
$160 a night. Everything inside Glenn’s apartment is gone. And it can
take time to get assistance.</p>
<p>“I ain’t going to say we’re homeless,” Glenn said. “But we’ve got to
start all over again.”</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough money to deal with
the immediate needs of people impacted by Helene and Milton but will
need additional funding at some point, FEMA administrator Deanne
Criswell said Friday.</p>
<p>The disaster assistance fund helps pay for the swift response to
hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. Congress recently
replenished the fund with $20 billion — the same amount as last
year.</p>

removes fake accounts in Moldova ahead of presidential election</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>STOCKHOLM — Meta Platforms said on Friday that it had removed a
network of group accounts targeting Russian speakers in Moldova ahead of
the country’s October 20 election, for violation of the company’s policy
on fake accounts.</p>
<p>Authorities in Moldova, an ex-Soviet state lying between Romania and
Ukraine, said they had blocked dozens of Telegram channels and chat bots
linked to a drive to pay voters to cast “no” ballots in a referendum on
European Union membership held alongside the presidential election.</p>
<p>Pro-European President Maia Sandu is seeking a second term in the
election and called the referendum on joining the 27-member bloc as the
cornerstone of her policies.</p>
<p>The fake Meta accounts posted criticism of Sandu, pro-EU politicians
and close ties between Moldova and Romania, and supported pro-Russia
parties in Moldova, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said its operation centered on about a dozen fictitious,
Russian-language news brands posing as independent entities with
presence on multiple internet services, including Meta-owned Facebook
and Instagram, as well as Telegram, OK.ru and TikTok.</p>
<p>Meta said it removed seven Facebook accounts, 23 pages, one group and
20 accounts on Instagram for violating its “coordinated inauthentic
behavior policy.”</p>
<p>About 4,200 accounts followed one or more of the 23 pages and about
335,000 accounts followed one or more of the Instagram accounts, Meta
said.</p>
<p>In Chisinau, the National Investigation Inspectorate said it had
blocked 15 channels of the popular Telegram messaging app and 95 chat
bots offering voters money. Users were told the channels “violated local
laws” on political party financing.</p>
<p>It had traced the accounts to supporters of fugitive businessman Ilan
Shor — members of the banned party bearing his name or the “Victory”
electoral bloc he had set up in its place from his base of exile in
Moscow.</p>
<p>Moldovan police said on Thursday that they searched homes of leaders
linked to Shor as part of a criminal investigation into
election-meddling. Police have said tens of thousands of voters were
paid off via accounts in a Russian bank to derail the vote.</p>
<p>Shor was sentenced to 15 years in jail in absentia last year in
connection with the 2014 disappearance of $1 billion from Moldovan
banks. He denies allegations of trying to bribe voters.</p>
<p>Sandu accuses Moscow of trying to topple her government while Moscow
has accused her of fomenting “Russophobia.”</p>

id="us-sues-virginia-over-alleged-violation-of-federal-election-law">US
sues Virginia over alleged violation of federal election law</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday that it had
sued the state of Virginia for violating the federal prohibition on
systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election.</p>
<p>On August 7, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed an executive
order requiring the commissioner of the Department of Elections to
certify that the department was conducting “daily updates to the voter
list” to remove, among other groups, people who are unable to verify
that they are citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles.</p>
<p>U.S. citizens who were identified and notified and did not affirm
their citizenship within 14 days would be removed from the list of
registered voters, the Justice Department said. It said this practice
has led to citizens having their voter registrations canceled ahead of
the November 5 election.</p>
<p>“By canceling voter registrations within 90 days of Election Day,
Virginia places qualified voters in jeopardy of being removed from the
rolls and creates the risk of confusion for the electorate,” said
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke.</p>
<p>“Congress adopted the National Voter Registration Act’s quiet period
restriction to prevent error-prone, eleventh-hour efforts that all too
often disenfranchise qualified voters,” Clarke added.</p>
<p>The department said it was seeking injunctive relief that would
restore the ability of affected eligible voters to cast their votes
unimpeded on Election Day and would prohibit future violations.</p>
<p>Youngkin called the move politically motivated and an attempt to
interfere in the election.</p>
<p>“With the support of our attorney general, we will defend these
common sense steps that we are legally required to take with every
resource available to us,” he said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>Republicans across the U.S. have pushed against noncitizen voting,
which is already illegal, ahead of the November election. Some election
officials have warned that the move could penalize eligible voters.</p>

id="experts-future-of-us-south-korea-defense-cost-sharing-deal-remains-uncertain">Experts:
Future of US-South Korea defense cost-sharing deal remains
uncertain</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — U.S. national security experts say it is unclear whether
a new cost-sharing agreement with South Korea, hailed by the State
Department as “a significant accomplishment,” will survive if former
President Donald Trump returns to the White House next year.</p>
<p>Concluded last week and effective from 2026, the five-year Special
Measures Agreement, or SMA, requires South Korea to raise its
contribution to the cost of stationing of U.S. troops in the country by
8.3% to $1.47 billion in the first year.</p>
<p>The two allies reached the agreement earlier than expected, a move
widely seen as key for Seoul and Washington to clinch before the U.S.
presidential election in November, in which Trump is the Republican
Party candidate.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department hailed the agreement as a “a significant
accomplishment for both sides” in a statement released on October 4.</p>
<p>But Trump, both in office and as a candidate, has consistently
demanded that South Korea contribute significantly more to the cost of
supporting U.S. forces in Korea. Most recently in April, Trump told Time
magazine that “I want South Korea to treat us properly,” adding that
Seoul is “paying virtually nothing for” the U.S. troops stationed in
South Korea.</p>
<p>‘Trump factor’</p>
<p>John Bolton, a former White House national security adviser during
the Trump administration, told VOA Korean by phone on Friday that “it’s
very likely that Trump would ask to renegotiate it.”</p>
<p>“I know that the administration [of President Joe Biden] here tried
to rush the coming-to-an-agreement on it, so that Trump couldn’t meddle
with it, but that won’t slow him down at all,” said Bolton, who also
served as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 2005-06.</p>
<p>“He never thinks his predecessors make good enough deals, and in
part, it’s not just the question of economics, but he doesn’t understand
collective defense alliances,” Bolton said.</p>
<p>“He thinks that not just with respect to the Republic of Korea, but
also with NATO or Japan or whatever that we’re defending, these
countries don’t pay us enough money.” The Republic of Korea is South
Korea’s formal name.</p>
<p>Bruce Klingner, the senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the
Heritage Foundation, pointed out the pact is “an executive agreement,”
which makes it easier for Trump to undo since it does not require
approval from Congress.</p>
<p>“We really don’t know whether he would just see it as a done deal, or
if he will seek to renegotiate it upward, where South Korea would pay
much more,” Klingner said.</p>
<p>“If you take a step back, it’s in our strategic interest to have
allies, it’s in our strategic interest to have our forces stationed
overseas, because actually, they’re less costly to the United States
when they’re stationed overseas than when they’re stationed
domestically.”</p>
<p>Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of
mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean
last week that he was concerned that the agreement wouldn’t pass muster
with a Trump administration should the former president win a second
term in November.</p>
<p>“Given his demands and expectations of U.S. allies with respect to
security burden sharing, my strong fear is that he will seek to
renegotiate today’s agreement with a much higher number in mind,” said
Rapson, who was directly involved in the two sets of SMA negotiations in
2013-14 and in 2019-21.</p>
<p>Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state
for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told VOA Korean on Thursday via
email that he suspected there was “considerable dissatisfaction with the
recently concluded SMA agreement in the Trump camp,” knowing how
strongly the former president feels about the burden-sharing issue.</p>
<p>Revere said he could not rule out the possibility that Trump will
come up with “a demand to reopen talks on the SMA issue, and toward that
end, he might make major new demands of Seoul” if he takes office
again.</p>
<p>‘It’s in our interest’</p>
<p>Other former government officials, like Klingner, believe it is too
early to predict whether Trump will try to revise the cost-sharing
agreement between the U.S. and South Korea.</p>
<p>Richard Armitage, who served as deputy secretary of state during the
George W. Bush administration, told VOA Korean on Wednesday on the
phone, “He might try, but let’s not get fearful about this too
soon.”</p>
<p>“If he comes to the White House, he will have a secretary of state,
defense, national security adviser, et cetera, who may have slightly
different views and can help moderate Mr. Trump.”</p>
<p>“Seoul and Washington understand that Trump is very transactional,”
Armitage said. “But American soldiers are not Hessians. We’re not for
rent. We’re in Korea because it’s in our interest.”</p>
<p>VOA Korean contacted the Trump campaign this week and asked what
Trump’s stance was on the newly reached agreement, but did not receive a
reply by the time this article was published.</p>
<p>Joeun Lee contributed to this report, which originated in VOA’s
Korean Service.</p>

soldier sentenced to 14 years in prison for trying to assist Islamic

<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — A U.S. Army soldier was sentenced to 14 years in prison
for attempting to help the Islamic State conduct a deadly ambush of U.S.
troops, the Department of Justice said on Friday.</p>
<p>Cole Bridges, also known as Cole Gonzales, 24, will undergo
supervised release for 10 years following his release from prison, the
department said.</p>
<p>Bridges, who was a private first class at the time of his arrest, was
charged in 2021 with giving “military advice and guidance on how to kill
fellow soldiers to individuals he thought were part of ISIS,” the
department said.</p>
<p>Bridges pleaded guilty to terrorism charges in June 2023. He joined
the Army in 2019.</p>
<p>Before joining, according to the department, he began researching and
consuming online propaganda “promoting jihadists and their violent
ideology, and began to express his support for ISIS and jihad on social
media.”</p>

id="boeing-lawyers-argue-for-settlement-opposed-by-relatives-of-those-killed-in-737-max-crashes">Boeing
lawyers argue for settlement opposed by relatives of those killed in 737
Max crashes</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>fort worth, Texas — Relatives of passengers who died in two crashes
of Boeing 737 Max planes came to a federal court in Texas on Friday to
listen as their lawyers asked a judge to throw out a plea agreement that
the aircraft manufacturer struck with prosecutors and put the company on
trial.</p>
<p>Their lawyers argued that Boeing’s punishment — mainly a fine
amounting to about $244 million — would be too light for misleading
regulators about a flight-control system that malfunctioned before the
crashes. They accused Boeing and the Justice Department of airbrushing
facts and ignoring that 346 people died in the crashes.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor asked a Boeing lawyer why he should
accept the prepackaged plea deal and a sentence negotiated by a
defendant.</p>
<p>The Boeing lawyer, Ben Hatch, said Boeing “is a pillar of the
national economy and the national defense” and needs to know the
punishment before it agrees to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit
fraud, a felony. Otherwise, he said, the company could be disbarred from
federal contracting.</p>
<p>“All the employees of the company, the shareholders of the company
and a global and national supply chain … all of those are put into doubt
if the sentencing” isn’t known, possibly for months, Hatch said.</p>
<p>The answer stunned and angered relatives of the victims.</p>
<p>“Boeing is too important for the economy — they’re too big to jail.
That’s what he’s saying,” Michael Stumo, whose daughter Samya died in
the second crash, said after the hearing. “It allows them to kill people
with no consequences because they’re too big and because their
shareholders won’t like it.”</p>
<p>The government joined Boeing in asking the judge to accept the deal
that they struck in July.</p>
<p>Sean Tonolli, senior deputy chief of the Justice Department’s fraud
section, said the conspiracy count is the most serious crime prosecutors
can bring — they can’t prove that Boeing’s deception of regulators
caused the crashes. And, he said, going to trial is risky.</p>
<p>“We are confident in our case, but we don’t take for granted that we
might not win,” he said.</p>
<p>The judge, who had received written arguments from all sides before
the hearing in Fort Worth, asked questions but gave no indication if he
is leaning one way or the other. He has expressed sympathy for the
passengers’ families before, writing in a 2023 ruling about “Boeing’s
egregious criminal conduct.”</p>
<p>“You have given me a lot to think about,” O’Connor said to all the
lawyers as Friday’s hearing ended. “I’ll get a ruling out just as soon
as I can.”</p>
<p>In July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of
conspiracy to commit fraud for allegedly deceiving Federal Aviation
Administration regulators who were writing pilot-training requirements
for the Max.</p>
<p>The FAA approved minimal, computer-based training for Boeing 737
pilots before they could fly the Max, the latest version of the 737.
That helped Boeing by avoiding the need for training in flight
simulators, which would have raised the cost for airlines to operate the
Max.</p>
<p>Airlines began flying the Max in 2017. The first crash occurred in
Indonesia in October 2018, followed in March 2019 by the second, in
Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The plea agreement calls for Boeing to pay a fine of up to $487.2
million, but the fine would be cut in half by giving the company credit
for $243.6 million it paid as part of a $2.5 billion settlement in 2021
to avoid prosecution. The Justice Department decided in May that Boeing
violated terms of that settlement, leading to the new plea deal.</p>
<p>Boeing, which is based in Arlington, Virginia, would also invest $455
million in compliance and safety programs, and be placed on probation
for three years.</p>
<p>The case is among a host of issues with which the manufacturer most
contend.</p>
<p>Talks broke down this week with striking factory workers who assemble
some of the company’s best-selling planes. The company withdrew its
offer and S&amp;P Global Ratings put it on its credit watch list, citing
increased financial risk because of the labor unrest.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the company filed a complaint over what it calls unfair
labor practices against the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers. Boeing in its complaint with the National Labor
Relations Board said that the union’s public narrative is misleading and
has made it difficult to reach a resolution.</p>

id="us-expands-sanctions-against-irans-oil-industry-after-attack-on-israel">US
expands sanctions against Iran’s oil industry after attack on
Israel</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States hit Iran’s oil and petrochemicals
sectors with fresh sanctions Friday in response to Tehran’s October 1
attack against Israel, designating dozens of new companies and firms.
 </p>
<p>In a statement Friday, the Treasury Department said it was going
after Iran’s so-called “shadow fleet” of ships involved in selling
Iranian oil in circumvention of existing sanctions, designating 10
companies and 17 vessels as “blocked property” over their involvement in
“shipments of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical products.” </p>
<p>The State Department announced it was sanctioning an additional six
firms and six ships for “knowingly engaging in a significant transaction
for the purchase, acquisition, sale, transport, or marketing of
petroleum or petroleum products from Iran.” </p>
<p>The sanctions form part of the U.S. response to Iran’s attack, in
which it launched some 200 ballistic missiles against Israel in
retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed militant leaders and a
general from Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. </p>
<p>Israel has said its response to Iran’s second direct attack against
its territory this year would be “deadly, precise, and surprising.” </p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that Israel should
consider “other alternatives than striking oil fields,” amid reports it
was planning to do so.  </p>
<p>“In response to Iran’s attack on Israel, the United States is taking
decisive action to further disrupt the Iranian regime’s ability to fund
and carry out its destabilizing activity,” Treasury Secretary Janet
Yellen said in a statement. </p>
<p>“Today’s sanctions target Iranian efforts to channel revenues from
its energy industry to finance deadly and disruptive activity —
including development of its nuclear program, the proliferation of
ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles,” she added.  </p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington had made clear
after the October 1 attack that Tehran would face consequences. </p>
<p>“To that end, we are taking steps today to disrupt the flow of
revenue the Iranian regime uses to fund its nuclear program and missile
development, support terrorist proxies and partners, and perpetuate
conflict throughout the Middle East,” he said in a statement.</p>

<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzgwNTYzNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4OTk4Mjk2M30.kuVlX3L_fl1HJr5V87YQw1GAt-KaSOW4MQ_WIl7l2rQ/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
As the southeastern U.S. recovers from hurricanes Helene and Milton, the
destruction the storms have left behind serves to underline the obvious:
The need for technologies that support climate change adaptation and
resilience is both real and urgent. And while nearly all the money in
climate finance still flows into mitigation tech, which seeks to lower
emissions to alleviate tomorrow’s harm, at long last, there are signs
that interest and funding for the adaptation space is picking up.
</p>
<p>
The emergence and success of climate resilience advisory and investment
firms such as Tailwind Climate and The Lightsmith Group are two signs of
this shift. Founded just last year, Tailwind recently published
<a href="https://www.tailwindclimate.com/taxonomy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
taxonomy</u></a> of activities and financing across the various sectors
of adaptation and resilience solutions to help clients understand
opportunity areas in the space. Next year, the firm’s co-founder Katie
MacDonald told me, Tailwind will likely begin raising its first fund.
It’s already invested in one company, UK-based
<a href="https://www.cryogenx.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cryogenx</u></a>,
which makes a portable cooling vest to rapidly reduce the temperature of
patients experiencing heatstroke.
</p>
<p>
As for Lightsmith, the firm held the final close of its
<a href="https://lightsmithgp.com/news-posts/lightsmith-group-closes-inaugural-186-million-growth-equity-climate-fund-the-first-to-focus-on-climate-resilience-and-adaptation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$186
million growth equity fund</u></a> for climate adaptation solutions in
2022, which co-founder and managing director Jay Koh told me is one of
the first, if not <em><em>the</em></em> first fund with a climate
resilience focus. As Koh sees it, the evolution of climate adaptation
and resilience technologies can be broken up into three stages, the
first being “reactive and incremental.” That’s largely where we’re at
right now, he said — think rebuilding a dam higher after it’s been
breached in a flood, or making a firebreak broader after a destructive
wildfire. Where he’s seeing interesting companies emerge, though, is in
the more proactive second stage, which often involves anticipating and
preparing for extreme weather events. “Let’s do a lot more data and
analytics ahead of time. Let’s deploy more weather satellites. Let’s
look at
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>deploying
artificial intelligence</u></a> and other technologies
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/brightband-ai-weather-forecasts" target="_self"><u>to
do better forecasting</u></a>,” Koh explained to me.
</p>
<p>
The third and final stage, he said, could be categorized as “systemic or
transcendent adaptation,” which involves systems-level changes as
opposed to incremental improvements. Source Global, one of Lightsmith’s
portfolio companies which makes solar-powered hydropanels that produce
affordable drinking water, is an example of this. As Koh told me, “It’s
not simply improving the efficiency of desalination filters by 5% or
10%. It’s saying, listen, we’re going to pull water out of the air in a
way that we have never done before.”
</p>
<p>
But while the activity and interest around adaptation tech may be
growing, the money just isn’t there yet. “We’re easily $50 [billion] to
$60 billion below where we need to be today,” MacDonald told me. “And
you know, we’re on the order of around $150 [billion] to $160 billion
below where we need to be by 2030.” Everyone else I spoke with echoed
the sentiment. “The latest statistics are that less than 5% of total
climate finance tracked on planet Earth is attributable to adaptation
and climate resilience,” Koh said. “Of that, less than 2% is private
investment.”
</p>
<p>
There’s a few reasons why early-stage investors especially may be
hesitant to throw their weight behind adaptation tech despite the clear
need in the market. Amy Francetic, co-founder and managing general
partner at Buoyant Ventures, which focuses on early-stage digital
solutions for climate risk, told me that the main customer for
adaptation solutions is often a government entity. “Municipalities and
other government contracts, they’re hard to win, they’re slow to win,
and they don’t pay that much, either, which is the problem.” Francetic
told me. “So it’s not a great customer to have.”
</p>
<p>
One of Buoyant’s portfolio companies, the now defunct StormSensor,
reinforced this lesson for Francetic. The company used sensors to track
water flow within storm and sewage systems to prevent flooding and was
able to arrange pilot projects with plenty of water agencies — but few
of them converted into paying contracts. “The municipalities were
willing to spend money on an experiment, but not so many of them had a
larger budget.” Francetic told me. The same dynamic, she said, is also
at play in the utility industry, where you often hear about new tech
succumbing to “death by pilot.”
</p>
<p>
It’s not all doom and gloom, though, when it comes to working with
larger, risk-averse agencies. AiDash, another of Lightsmith’s portfolio
companies that uses artificial intelligence to help utilities assess and
address wildfire risk, has five utility partnerships, and earlier this
year
<a href="https://www.aidash.com/news/aidash-closes-its-oversubscribed-series-c-funding-round-at-58-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>raised
$58.5 million</u></a> in an oversubscribed Series C round. Francetic and
MacDonald both told me they’re seeing the conversation around climate
adaptation evolve to include more industry stakeholders. In the past,
Francetic said, discussing resilience and adaptation was almost seen as
a form of climate doomerism. “They said, oh, why are you doing that? It
shows that you’re giving up.” But now, MacDonald told me that her
experience at this year’s climate week in New York was defined by
productive conversations with representatives from the insurance
industry, banking sector, and venture capital arena about injecting more
capital into the space.
</p>
<p>
Bill Clerico, the founder and managing partner of the venture firm
Convective Capital, is also deeply familiar with the tricky dynamics of
climate adaptation funding. Convective, founded in 2022, is solely
dedicated to
<a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/ai-fire-prevention" target="_self"><u>wildfire
tech</u></a> solutions. The firm’s portfolio companies span a range of
technologies that address suppression, early identification, prevention,
and insurance against damages, and are mainly looking to work with
utilities, governments, and insurance companies. When I talked to
Clerico back in August, he (understatedly) categorized these
establishments as “not necessarily the most fast-moving or innovative.”
But the bleak silver lining, he told me, is that extreme weather is
forcing them to up their tempo. “There is so much destruction happening
so frequently that it’s forcing a lot of these institutions to think
about it totally differently and to embrace newer, more novel solutions
— and to do it quickly.”
</p>
<p>
People, it seems, are starting to get real. But investors and startups
alike are also just beginning to define exactly what adaptation tech
encompasses and what metrics for success look like when they’re less
measurable than, say, the tons of carbon sucked out of the atmosphere
via direct air capture, or the amount of energy produced by a fusion
reactor.
</p>
<p>
“Nobody wakes up in the morning and buys a loaf of adaptation. You don’t
drive around in an adaptation or live in an adaptation,” Koh noted.
“What you want is food, transport, shelter, water that is resilient and
adapted to the effects of climate change.” What Koh and the team at
Lightsmith have found is that many of the companies working on these
solutions are hiding in plain sight. “They call themselves business
continuity or water efficiency or agricultural precision technologies or
supply chain management in the face of weather volatility,” Koh
explained.
</p>
<p>
In this way, the scope of adaptation technology balloons far beyond what
is traditionally climate-coded.
<a href="https://lightsmithgp.com/news-posts/lightsmith-leads-16-6-million-investment-round-in-digital-health-leader-beep-saude-supporting-climate-resilience-in-healthcare/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Lightsmith
recently invested</u></a> in a Brazil-based digital health company
called Beep Saude, which enables patients to get rapid, in-home
diagnostics, vaccination services, and infusion therapies. It falls
under the umbrella of climate adaptation tech, Koh told me, because
rising temperatures, increased rainfall, and deforestation in the
country have led to a rapid increase in mosquitoes spreading diseases
such as dengue fever and the Zika virus.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, measuring the efficacy of solutions that span such a vast
problem space means a lot of customization. “Your metric might be, how
many people have asked for water in a drought-prone area?” MacDonald
told me. “And with health, it might be, how many children are safe from
wildfire smoke during fire season? And for ecosystems, it might be, how
many hectares of ecosystem have been saved as a means to reduce storm
surge?” Insurance also brings up a host of additional metrics. As
Francetic told me, “we measure things like lives and livelihoods covered
or addressed. We measure things like losses covered or underwriting
dollars spent on this.”
</p>
<p>
No matter how you categorize it or measure it, the need for these
technologies is not going away. “The drivers of adaptation and climate
resilience demand are physics and time,” Koh told me. “Whoever develops
climate resilience and adaptation technology will have a competitive
advantage over any other company, any other society, and the faster that
we can scale it up, and the smarter and more equitable we are about
deploying it, the better off we will all be.”

id="biden-again-blasts-disinformation-after-second-hurricane-batters-south">Biden
again blasts disinformation after second hurricane batters South</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WHITE HOUSE — During a briefing Friday on recovery efforts after
Hurricane Milton at the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden again
warned about the spread of “disgusting” and “dangerous” misinformation
and disinformation about the federal government’s response to recent
storms.</p>
<p>Responding to a reporter’s question, Biden said that misleading
information hurts people who need the most help. “Widowers, people in
hospitals, people who are by themselves and they don’t know, and they
lose contact, and they get scared to death,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’re breaking through with it. We’re breaking through with the
truth,” he said, noting that Republican governors and mayors have
supported his call to stop the spread of disinformation.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee,
has been spreading disinformation about the government’s response,
including that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, is
limiting payouts to disaster survivors to $750, and that funding for
Americans who are affected by the disaster was used up to provide
housing for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>“I think those who have been spreading these lies to try to undermine
the opposition are going to pay a price for it,” Biden said, adding that
Trump is not solely to blame but has the “biggest mouth.”</p>
<p>Biden provided an update on the federal government’s response to
hurricanes Milton and Helene flanked by his top aides, including
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm and Secretary of Homeland Security
Alejandro Mayorkas. He was joined virtually by Vice President Kamala
Harris from her campaign stop in Arizona.</p>
<p>Harris again warned companies against taking advantage of the storms
to increase profit.</p>
<p>“Any company or individual that is using this crisis to jack up
prices through illegal fraud or price gouging, whether it be at the gas
pump, the airport or the hotel counter, we will be monitoring, and there
will be a consequence,” she said.</p>
<p>Milton deaths</p>
<p>Authorities in Florida said Friday that Hurricane Milton was
responsible for at least 16 deaths, and that more than 2 million people
remained without power as evacuees returned to their homes to assess the
damage and begin cleaning up from the storm.</p>
<p>As of midday Friday, the website poweroutage.us reported 2.3 million
people remained without power. Late Thursday, Biden said more than
50,000 line workers and 1,000 federal personnel were on the ground to
respond.</p>
<p>The storm made landfall late Wednesday near Siesta Key in Sarasota
County as a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 205
kilometers per hour. It carved a path of destruction across central
Florida, affecting many communities still cleaning up from Hurricane
Helene two weeks earlier.</p>
<p>While the state’s western coast felt the direct hit from the storm,
Milton also spawned tornados that affected the southeastern part of the
state. Local media reported more than 19 tornadoes touched down even
before the hurricane made landfall. Tornadoes are believed responsible
for several deaths.</p>
<p>State government officials and the Florida National Guard reported
more than 1,000 people were rescued since the storm made landfall.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard reported one of its aircrews rescued a man
Wednesday clinging to a cooler floating in the Gulf of Mexico 48
kilometers off the Florida coast. It said the man was later taken to
Tampa General Hospital for medical treatment.</p>
<p>State officials said while total damage assessments are still being
made, the storm could have been much worse. The population center of
Tampa was spared a direct hit, and the predicted record-setting storm
surge did not materialize.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientists said climate change made Hurricane Milton
stronger and more dangerous.</p>
<p>In a report issued Friday, the nonprofit group Weather Attribution
said Milton went through an “explosive intensification” from a tropical
storm to a Category 5 hurricane in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The group said the rapid intensification was driven and sustained by
very high sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Some information for this report came from Reuters, The Associated
Press and Agence France-Presse.</p>

id="back-to-back-hurricanes-reshape-2024-campaigns-final-stretch">Back-to-back
hurricanes reshape 2024 campaign’s final stretch</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A pair of unwelcome and destructive guests named Helene
and Milton have stormed their way into this year’s U.S. presidential
election.</p>
<p>The back-to-back hurricanes have jumbled the schedules of Democrat
Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, both of whom devoted part of
their recent days to tackling questions about the storm recovery
effort.</p>
<p>The two hurricanes are forcing basic questions about who as president
would best respond to deadly natural disasters, a once-overlooked issue
that has become an increasingly routine part of the job. And just weeks
before the November 5 election, the storms have disrupted the mechanics
of voting in several key counties.</p>
<p>Vice President Harris is trying to use this as an opportunity to
project leadership, appearing alongside President Joe Biden at briefings
and calling for bipartisan cooperation. Former President Trump is trying
to use the moment to attack the administration’s competence and question
whether it is withholding help from Republican areas, despite no
evidence of such behavior.</p>
<p>Adding to the pressure is the need to provide more money for the
Small Business Administration and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which would require House Republicans to work with the
Democratic administration. Biden said Thursday that lawmakers should
address the situation immediately.</p>
<p>Timothy Kneeland, a professor at Nazareth University in Rochester,
New York, who has studied the issue, said, “Dealing with back-to-back
crises will put FEMA under more scrutiny and, therefore, the Biden
administration will be under a microscope in the days leading up to the
election.</p>
<p>“Vice President Harris must empathize with the victims without
altering the campaign schedule and provide consistent messaging on the
widespread devastation that makes FEMA’s work even more challenging than
normal,” Kneeland said.</p>
<p>Already, Trump and Harris have separately gone to Georgia to assess
hurricane damage and pledge support, and Harris has visited North
Carolina, requiring the candidates to cancel campaign events elsewhere
and use up time that is a precious resource in the final weeks before
any election. Georgia and North Carolina are political battlegrounds,
raising the stakes.</p>
<p>Campaign language altered</p>
<p>The hurricane fallout is evident in the candidates’ campaign events
as well.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the first question Harris got at a Univision town hall
in Las Vegas came from a construction worker and undecided voter from
Tampa, Florida. Ramiro Gonzalez asked about talk that the administration
has not done enough to support people after Helene, and whether the
people in Milton’s path would have access to aid — a sign that Trump’s
messaging is breaking through with some potential voters.</p>
<p>Harris has called out the level of misinformation being circulated by
Republicans, but her fuller answer revealed the dynamics at play just a
few weeks before an election.</p>
<p>“I have to stress that this is not a time for people to play
politics,” she said.</p>
<p>On the same day, Trump opened his speech at the Detroit Economic Club
by praising Republican governors in the affected states and blasting the
Biden-Harris administration.</p>
<p>“They’ve let those people suffer unjustly,” he said about those
affected by Helene in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Voting systems affected</p>
<p>The storms have also scrambled the voting process in places. North
Carolina’s State Board of Elections has passed a resolution to help
people in the state’s affected counties vote. Florida will allow some
counties greater flexibility in distributing mail-in ballots and
changing polling sites for in-person voting. But a federal judge in
Georgia said Thursday the state doesn’t need to reopen voter
registration despite the disruptions by Helene.</p>
<p>Tension and controversy have begun to override the disaster response,
with Biden on Wednesday and Thursday saying that Trump has spread
falsehoods that are “un-American.”</p>
<p>Candace Bright Hall-Wurst, a sociology professor at East Tennessee
State University, said that natural disasters have become increasingly
politicized, often putting more of the focus on the politicians instead
of the people in need.</p>
<p>“Disasters are politicized when they have political value to the
candidate,” she said. “This does not mean that the politicization is
beneficial to victims.”</p>
<p>As the Democratic nominee, Harris has suddenly been a major part of
the response to hurricanes, a role that traditionally has not involved
vice presidents in prior administrations.</p>
<p>On Thursday, she participated virtually at a Situation Room briefing
on Milton while she was in Nevada for campaign activities. She has
huddled in meetings about response plans and on Wednesday phoned into
CNN live to discuss the administration’s efforts.</p>
<p>At a Wednesday appearance with Biden to discuss Milton ahead of it
making landfall, Harris subtly tied back the issues into her campaign
policies to stop price gouging on food and other products.</p>
<p>“To any company that — or individual that — might use this crisis to
exploit people who are desperate for help through illegal fraud or price
gouging — whether it be at the gas pump, the airport or the hotel
counter — know that we are monitoring these behaviors and the situation
on the ground very closely and anyone taking advantage of consumers will
be held accountable,” she said.</p>
<p>Harris warned that Milton “poses extreme danger.” It made landfall in
Florida late Wednesday and left more than 3 million without power. But
the storm surge never reached the same levels as Helene, which led to
roughly 230 fatalities and for a prolonged period left mountainous parts
of North Carolina without access to electricity, cell service and
roads.</p>
<p>Misinformation about Helene</p>
<p>Trump and his allies have seized on the aftermath of Helene to spread
misinformation about the administration’s response. Their debunked
claims include statements that victims can only receive $750 in aid, as
well as false charges that emergency response funds were diverted to
immigrants.</p>
<p>The former president said the administration’s response to Helene was
worse than the George W. Bush administration’s widely panned handling of
Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which led to nearly 1,400 deaths.</p>
<p>“This hurricane has been a bad one; Kamala Harris has left them
stranded,” Trump said at a recent rally in Juneau, Wisconsin. “This is
the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we’ve
ever seen ever. Probably worse than Katrina, and that’s hard to beat,
right?”</p>
<p>Asked about the Trump campaign’s strategic thinking on emphasizing
the hurricane response, campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said
it reflects a pattern of “failed leadership” by the Biden administration
that also includes the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and
security at the U.S. southern border.</p>
<p>John Gasper, a Carnegie Mellon University professor who has
researched government responses to natural disasters, said storm victims
generally want to ensure foremost that they get the aid they need.</p>
<p>“These disasters essentially end up being good tests of leadership
for local, state and federal officials in how they respond,” he
said.</p>
<p>But Gasper noted that U.S. politics have gotten so polarized and
other issues such as the economy are shaping the election, such that the
debate currently generating so much heat between Trump and the Biden
administration might not matter that much on Election Day.</p>

lawmakers seek answers from telecoms on Chinese hacking report</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers asked AT&amp;T,
Verizon Communications, and Lumen Technologies on Friday to answer
questions after a report that Chinese hackers accessed the networks of
U.S. broadband providers. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported Saturday hackers obtained
information from systems the federal government uses for
court-authorized wiretapping, and said the three companies were among
the telecoms whose networks were breached. </p>
<p>House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a
Republican, and the top Democrat on the committee Representative Frank
Pallone along with Representatives Bob Latta and Doris Matsui asked the
three companies to answer questions. They are seeking a briefing and
detailed answers by next Friday. </p>
<p>“There is a growing concern regarding the cybersecurity
vulnerabilities embedded in U.S. telecommunications networks,” the
lawmakers said. They are asking for details on what information was
seized and when the companies learned about the intrusion. </p>
<p>AT&amp;T and Lumen declined to comment, while Verizon did not
immediately comment. </p>
<p>It was unclear when the hack occurred. </p>
<p>Hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure
used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized U.S. requests
for communications data, the Journal said. It said the hackers had also
accessed other tranches of internet traffic. </p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that it was not aware of the
attack described in the report but said the United States had “concocted
a false narrative” to “frame” China in the past.</p>

emission cuts towards their own climate targets by trading instruments
that represent one tonne of carbon dioxide removed or saved from the
atmosphere.” The experts this week said projects seeking carbon credits
will have to carry out an extensive risk assessment process aimed at
flagging and preventing human rights abuses and environmental harm. The
assessment will be reviewed by external auditors.

<h2 id="blinken-warns-china-against-provocations-toward-taiwan">Blinken
warns China against provocations toward Taiwan</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>VIENTIANE, LAOS — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken Friday
warned China against military provocations toward Taiwan, following
Beijing’s strong reaction to an annual speech by the leader of the
self-ruled democracy.</p>
<p>“I can tell you that with regard to the so-called Ten Ten speech,
which is a regular exercise, China should not use it in any fashion as a
pretext for provocative actions,” Blinken told reporters during a press
conference in Vientiane, Laos. </p>
<p>He was referring to October 10, known as Double Ten Day, when Taiwan
celebrates the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, just months
after an uprising that began on October 10, 1911.</p>
<p>The People’s Republic of China celebrates its national day on October
1, marking the founding of the country in 1949. </p>
<p>China has continued to ramp up its military threats against Taiwan,
following President Lai Ching-te’s Thursday speech, which rejected
China’s claim of sovereignty over the island.</p>
<p>Blinken was in Vientiane for meetings with leaders from the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and participated in the East Asia
Summit. </p>
<p>He said there is a strong desire among all ASEAN countries, along
with others present, to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait, with neither side taking actions that undermine the status
quo.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Taiwan detected 20 Chinese military aircraft and
10 naval vessels around Taiwan. Thirteen of the aircraft crossed the
median line and entered Taiwan’s northern and southwestern Air Defense
Identification Zone, according to a posting on social media platform X
by Taiwan’s defense ministry.</p>
<p>Between Wednesday and Thursday, Taiwan also detected 27 Chinese
military aircraft, nine naval vessels, and five official ships.</p>
<p>In Beijing, Chinese officials said Taiwan “has no so-called
sovereignty.”</p>
<p>Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry,
slammed Lai, accusing him of having “the ill intention of heightening
tensions in the Taiwan Strait for his selfish political interest.”</p>
<p>Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949, when Mao Zedong’s communists
took power in Beijing after defeating Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang
nationalists in a civil war, prompting the nationalists’ relocation to
the island.</p>
<p>Washington switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing
to counter the then-Soviet Union in 1979.  </p>
<p>Since then, relations between the U.S. and Taiwan have been governed
by the Taiwan Relations Act that Congress passed in April 1979, under
which the U.S. provides defense equipment to Taiwan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In September, Taiwan President Lai said if China’s claims over Taiwan
are truly based on concerns about territorial integrity, it should also
seek to reclaim the 600,000 square kilometers of land it ceded to Russia
in the 19th century — an area almost the size of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The final outcome of the case: the plaintiff was ordered to cover
$102,404 in fees and $165.72 in costs for the defendant. This should
serve as a cautionary tale for would-be plaintiffs: copyright lawsuits,
like any other type of litigation, are primarily meant to address the
damages plaintiffs actually suffered, and the final settlement should
make plaintiffs whole again—that is, as if no infringement has ever
occurred. Copyright lawsuits (or the threat to sue) should not be
undertaken as a way to create brand new income streams. </p>

id="us-still-believes-iran-has-not-decided-to-build-a-nuclear-weapon-us-officials-say">US
still believes Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon, US
officials say</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States still believes that Iran has not
decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran’s recent strategic
setbacks, including Israel’s killing of Hezbollah leaders and two
largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel, two U.S. officials told
Reuters.</p>
<p>The comments from a senior Biden administration official and a
spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
(ODNI) added to public remarks earlier this week by CIA Director William
Burns, who said the United States had not seen any evidence Iran’s
leader had reversed his 2003 decision to suspend the weaponization
program.</p>
<p>“We assess that the Supreme Leader has not made a decision to resume
the nuclear weapons program that Iran suspended in 2003,” said the ODNI
spokesperson, referring to Iran’s leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
<p>The intelligence assessment could help explain U.S. opposition to any
Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear program in retaliation for a ballistic
missile attack that Tehran carried out last week.</p>
<p>U.S. President Joe Biden said after that attack he would not support
an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites, but did not explain why he
had reached that conclusion. His remarks drew fierce criticism from
Republicans, including former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have long acknowledged that an attempt to destroy
Iran’s nuclear weapons program might only delay the country’s efforts to
develop a nuclear bomb and could even strengthen Tehran’s resolve to do
so.</p>
<p>“We’re all watching this space very carefully,” the Biden
administration official said.</p>
<p>Iran’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately
respond to a request for comment but Tehran has repeatedly denied ever
having had a nuclear weapons program.</p>
<p>Key Iran ally weakened</p>
<p>In the past weeks, Israel’s military has inflicted heavy losses on
Hezbollah, the most powerful member of the Iran-backed network known as
the Axis of Resistance. The group’s setbacks have included the killing
of its leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike last month.</p>
<p>The weakening of a key Iranian ally has prompted some experts to
speculate that Tehran may restart its efforts to acquire a nuclear bomb
to protect itself.</p>
<p>Beth Sanner, a former U.S deputy director of national intelligence,
said the risk of Khamenei reversing his 2003 religious dictum against
nuclear weapons is “higher now than it has been” and that if Israel were
to strike nuclear facilities Tehran would likely move ahead with
building a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>That would still take time, however.</p>
<p>“They can’t get a weapon in a day. It will take months and months and
months,” said Sanner, now a fellow with the German Marshall Fund.</p>
<p>Iran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, close to
the 90% of weapons grade, at two sites, and in theory it has enough
material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for almost four
bombs, according to a yardstick of the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA), the U.N. watchdog.</p>
<p>The expansion in Iran’s enrichment program has reduced the so-called
breakout time it would need to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for
a nuclear bomb to “a week or a little more,” according to Burns, from
more than a year under a 2015 accord that Trump pulled out of when
president. Actually making a bomb with that material would take longer.
How long is less clear and the subject of debate.</p>
<p>Possible Israeli attack</p>
<p>Israel has not yet disclosed what it will target in retaliation for
Iran’s attack last week with more than 180 ballistic missiles, which
largely failed thanks to interceptions by Israeli air defenses as well
as by the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The United States has been privately urging Israel to calibrate its
response to avoid triggering a broader war in the Middle East, officials
say, with Biden publicly voicing his opposition to a nuclear attack and
concerns about a strike on Iran’s energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>Israel, however, views Iran’s nuclear program as an existential
threat.</p>
<p>The conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Iran and
Iran-backed groups in Lebanon, Gaza and Yemen have become campaign
issues ahead of the November 5 presidential election, with Trump and his
Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, positioning themselves
as pro-Israel.</p>
<p>Speaking at a campaign event last week, Trump mocked Biden for
opposing an attack on Iran’s nuclear sites, saying: “That’s the thing
you wanna hit, right?”</p>
<p>Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence officer and government
official, said Iran still had space to compensate for setbacks dealt to
its proxies and missile force without having to resort to developing a
nuclear warhead.</p>
<p>“The Iranians have to recalculate what’s next. I don’t think at this
point they will rush to either develop or boost the (nuclear) program
toward military capacity,” he said.</p>
<p>“They will look around to find what maneuvering space they can move
around in.”</p>

id="blinken-tells-asean-the-us-is-worried-about-chinas-actions-in-south-china-sea">Blinken
tells ASEAN the US is worried about China’s actions in South China
Sea</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>VIENTIANE, Laos — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told
Southeast Asian leaders Friday that the U.S. is concerned about China’s
“increasingly dangerous and unlawful” activities in the disputed South
China Sea during an annual summit meeting and pledged the U.S. will
continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the vital sea trade
route.</p>
<p>The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations’ meeting with
Blinken followed a series of violent confrontations at sea between China
and ASEAN members Philippines and Vietnam, which have fueled concerns
that China’s increasingly assertive actions in the waterways could
spiral into a full-scale conflict.</p>
<p>China, which claims almost the entire sea, has overlapping claims
with ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei, as
well as Taiwan. About a third of global trade transits through the sea,
which is also rich in fishing stocks, gas and oil.</p>
<p>Beijing has refused to recognize a 2016 international arbitration
ruling by a U.N.-affiliated court in the Hague that invalidated its
expansive claims and has built up and militarized islands it
controls.</p>
<p>“We are very concerned about China’s increasingly dangerous and
unlawful activities in the South China Sea which have injured people,
harm vessels from ASEAN nations and contradict commitments to peaceful
resolutions of disputes,” said Blinken, who is filling in for President
Joe Biden, in his opening speech at the U.S.-ASEAN summit. “The United
States will continue to support freedom of navigation, and freedom of
overflight in the Indo Pacific.”</p>
<p>The United States has no claims in the South China Sea but has
deployed navy ships and fighter jets to patrol the waters in a challenge
to China’s claims.</p>
<p>Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and
Vietnam said last week that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in
the disputed sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that
Indonesia and Malaysia claim as exclusive economic zones.</p>
<p>The United States has warned repeatedly that it’s obligated to defend
the Philippines — its oldest treaty ally in Asia — if Filipino forces,
ships or aircraft come under armed attack, including in the South China
Sea.</p>
<p>Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. complained to summit
leaders on Thursday that his country “continues to be subject to
harassment and intimidation” by China. He said it was “regrettable that
the overall situation in the South China Sea remains tense and
unchanged” due to China’s actions, which he said violated international
law. He has called for more urgency in ASEAN-China negotiations on a
code of conduct to govern the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Singaporean leader Lawrence Wong earlier this week warned of “real
risks of an accident spiraling into conflict” if the sea dispute isn’t
addressed.</p>
<p>Malaysia, who takes over the rotating ASEAN chair next year, is
expected to push to accelerate talks on the code of conduct. Officials
have agreed to try and complete the code by 2026, but talks have been
hampered by sticky issues including disagreements over whether the pact
should be binding.</p>
<p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang was defiant during talks on Thursday. He
called South China Sea a “shared home” but repeated China’s assertion
that it was merely protecting its sovereign rights, officials said. Li
also blamed meddling by “external forces” who sought to “introduce bloc
confrontation and geopolitical conflicts into Asia.” Li didn’t name the
foreign forces, but China has previously warned the U.S. not to meddle
in the region’s territorial disputes.</p>
<p>In another firm message to China, Blinken said the United States
believed “it is also important to maintain our shared commitment to
protect stability across the Taiwan Strait.” China claims the self-ruled
island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries’
patrolling the body of water separating it from the island.</p>
<p>Blinken also attended an 18-nation East Asia Summit, along with the
Chinese premier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and leaders
from Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>ASEAN has treaded carefully on the sea dispute with China, which is
the bloc’s largest trading partner and its third largest investor. It
hasn’t marred trade relations, with the two sides focusing on expanding
a free trade area covering a market of 2 billion people.</p>
<p>Blinken said the annual ASEAN summit talks were a platform to address
other shared challenges including the civil war in Myanmar, North
Korea’s “destabilizing behavior” and Russia’s war aggression in Ukraine.
He said the U.S. remained the top foreign investor in the region and
aims to strengthen its partnership with ASEAN.</p>

id="hurricane-milton-disrupts-yom-kippur-plans-for-jews-in-florida">Hurricane
Milton disrupts Yom Kippur plans for Jews in Florida</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WINTER PARK, Florida — Many Jews worldwide will mark Yom Kippur in
fasting and prayer at their synagogues this weekend.</p>
<p>But for the faithful in Florida, destructive Hurricane Milton has
disrupted plans for observing the Day of Atonement — the holiest day of
the year in the Jewish faith — that begins Friday evening and caps off
the High Holy Days that began with Rosh Hashana on October 2.</p>
<p>Across the storm-threatened areas, rabbis and their congregants spent
part of the Days of Awe — the span between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur —
protecting their homes and synagogues as Milton churned off the coast,
spiraling into a Category 5 storm. Many — though not all — evacuated,
heeding the voluntary and mandatory orders, and found safekeeping for
their synagogues’ Torah scrolls and themselves.</p>
<p>Milton hit Florida’s Gulf Coast on Wednesday as a Category 3 cyclone,
with damaging winds, heavy rains and tornadoes. By Thursday, the storm
had moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>Why this rabbi decided against evacuating before storm</p>
<p>Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz evacuated most of his family ahead of the
storm, but chose to ride it out with his son, also a rabbi, at Chabad
Lubavitch of Southwest Florida near Fort Myers. The center is hosting
people displaced by the storm, including doctors, first responders and
elderly who cannot evacuate.</p>
<p>It’s important to be “with the people and for the people,” and
provide emotional and spiritual support, he said as the storm
approached.</p>
<p>Near midnight Thursday, the Chabad center and the rest of the
neighborhood lost power, said Minkowicz, making them among the millions
without it. The center was spared from the storm surge, but homes and
other buildings in the area were not, he said.</p>
<p>“Our pressing need is for Power so that we can help our community
&amp; hold Yom Kippur services,” Minkowicz told The Associated Press via
email Thursday. “We’re praying for this to be resolved asap.”</p>
<p>The center planned to host Yom Kippur observances regardless of the
storm. He said it was similar two years ago, when the holy day followed
the major hurricane, Ian.</p>
<p>“Yom Kippur is a day that you open up your soul to God and you
totally connect with God,” Minkowicz said. “When you go through a
hurricane, anything materialistic is not important. They’re already in
that zone where they’re totally focused on God.”</p>
<p>Congregation Beth Am in the Tampa Bay area also lost power and plans
to hold Yom Kippur services online, said Rabbi Jason Rosenberg of the
Reform synagogue.</p>
<p>“It’s important to keep perspective. Having a service online is not
what anybody wants, but it could’ve been a lot worse,” he said. “This
feels like a blessing.”</p>
<p>The storm underscored one of Yom Kippur’s annual reflections.</p>
<p>An implicit question, he said before Milton’s landfall, is “If this
was going to be your last year on earth, how would you want to act
differently? … When you’ve got a historical storm, a potentially
life-threatening and life-altering storm bearing down on you, that
message is really present.”</p>
<p>Milton disrupts Yom Kippur and October 7 commemoration</p>
<p>Like most of her congregants, Rabbi Nicole Luna had evacuated after
helping secure Temple Beth El in Fort Myers, and entrusting several
Torah scrolls to congregants should the threatened surge devastate the
synagogue.</p>
<p>While the congregation braved Hurricanes Irma in 2017 and Ian in
2022, Milton’s timing hit especially hard, having already forced the
postponement of community-wide commemoration of Hamas attacking Israel
on October 7, 2023. The war that followed is ongoing.</p>
<p>“It just feels like too much for our hearts to carry right now,” Luna
said from Miami ahead of the storm. “It’s all very heavy.”</p>
<p>After the storm passed through, Luna told her congregation that their
synagogue had emerged undamaged, though it lost power.</p>
<p>She announced plans for a service via Zoom on Friday evening, and
in-person services Saturday.</p>
<p>“We hope by Saturday more traffic lights will be restored but please
only come if you can safely navigate the roads,” she said in her
message.</p>
<p>Luna said she was grateful for the “big outpouring of support” she
received from fellow rabbis across the East Coast of Florida, who were
opening their temples for the holidays to evacuees and have emphasized
they can come as they are since few grabbed “holiday-appropriate
clothing” in the rush to escape Milton’s fury.</p>
<p>The Chabad of Southwest Broward near Fort Lauderdale is hosting
several evacuees from areas most affected by the storm, ranging from a
mother with her newborn to an elderly couple, said director Rabbi Pinny
Andrusier. They are invited to spend Yom Kippur with the Cooper
City-based group, including sharing kosher meals before and after the
day of fasting.</p>
<p>“We were spared, thank God,” Andrusier said of the storm. “We’ve been
able to open up our doors” for those in the hurricane zone.</p>
<p>Synagogue skips holding Yom Kippur services</p>
<p>Hundreds of Jewish families on Longboat Key, a barrier island off
Sarasota Bay, won’t be able to observe Yom Kippur in their synagogue for
the very first time in their 45-year history, said Shepard Englander,
CEO of The Jewish Federation of Sarasota-Manatee.</p>
<p>Access to the island, specifically the John Ringling Causeway, was
closed ahead of the storm. The congregation decided it wasn’t worth
risking Milton’s might for Day of Atonement services. They had
celebrated Rosh Hashana in their building despite a number of nearby
homes being damaged by Hurricane Helene, which made landfall last
month.</p>
<p>Englander said he and his family evacuated from their home on a
riverbank outside Sarasota and were hunkered down at a friend’s home
inland. From there, he was trying to make sure community members from
Longboat Key and other temples that won’t have services can say their
prayers and break their daylong Yom Kippur fast at a newly constructed
conference center in Sarasota with food items like blintzes, bagels,
cream cheese and smoked salmon.</p>
<p>Ahead of the storm, people were scattered in the region at emergency
shelters or staying with family or friends, Englander said.</p>
<p>“It’s in difficult times that you really understand the power of
community,” he said. “And this is a caring, tight-knit, generous Jewish
community.”</p>

rescued from Colorado gold mine where elevator mishap killed 1
person</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>denver — Twelve people were rescued Thursday night after being
trapped for about six hours at the bottom of a former Colorado gold mine
when an elevator malfunctioned at the tourist site, authorities said.
One person died in the accident.</p>
<p>The elevator was descending into the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine near
the town of Cripple Creek when it had a mechanical problem around 150
meters beneath the surface, creating a “severe danger for the
participants,” and one person was killed, Teller County Sheriff Jason
Mikesell said.</p>
<p>The 12 adults who were trapped were about 305 meters below ground,
but they had access to water and the atmosphere was considered good.
They were safe and in communication with authorities with radios while
waiting, Mikesell said.</p>
<p>They were in good spirits after they were rescued, and authorities
gave them pizza once they were out and told them everything that had
happened, he said. While at the bottom, authorities had told them only
that there was an elevator issue.</p>
<p>Mikesell said during a nighttime briefing that authorities do not
know yet what caused the malfunction and an investigation is underway.
Engineers worked to make sure the elevator was working safely again
before bringing the stranded visitors back up on it. They had been
prepared to bring them up by rope if necessary, had they not been able
to get the elevator fixed.</p>
<p>Mikesell declined to reveal the identification of the victim.</p>
<p>The incident, which was reported to authorities at about noon,
happened during the final week of the Mollie Kathleen Gold Mine season
before it shuts down for the winter, Mikesell said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the afternoon — while the 12 were stuck at the bottom — 11
other people who were riding the elevator were rescued. Four had minor
injuries. The sheriff did not elaborate on how they were injured.</p>
<p>The elevator ride typically takes about two minutes, travelling about
152 meters per minute, according to the mine’s website.</p>
<p>Mikesell said the last time there was an incident was in the 1980s
when a couple of people were trapped on the elevator. Nobody died in
that incident.</p>
<p>Mines that operate as tourist attractions in Colorado must designate
someone to inspect the mines and the transportation systems daily,
according to the state Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety.
Mikesell said he didn’t know the date of the last inspection. Records of
the inspections weren’t immediately available online.</p>
<p>Gov. Jared Polis sent state resources including a mine rescue
team.</p>
<p>Cripple Creek is a town of about 1,100 in the Rocky Mountains
southwest of Colorado Springs.</p>
<p>The mine opened in the 1800s and closed in 1961, but still operates
tours. Its website describes a one-hour tour in which visitors descend
304 meters. It says they can see veins of gold in the rock and ride an
underground tram.</p>
<p>A woman named Mollie Kathleen Gortner discovered the site of the mine
in 1891 when she saw quartz laced with gold, according to the company’s
website.</p>
