Advertise Stolen Verizon Push-to-Talk ‘Call Logs’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-12, from: 404 Media Group</p>
<p>The breach does not appear to impact the main consumer Verizon
network, and instead involves the company’s push to talk (PTT) product,
marketed to public sector agencies and enterprises.</p>

<p>Why does American television and press “both-sides” our politics? Why
are such different presidential candidates presented as equally flawed?
Why do the outrages of Trump, for example at the Republican National

One of the features of using a custom email address with every service
or website is that it’s easy to see when information gets sold to third
parties. Today’s inbox let me know it’s time to shut down my Macy’s
alias, and also that Macy’s as a company is in some trouble.

<p>
Selling off customer data for reasons other than partnering or targeted
advertisements is a short term cash grab move. Interestingly their stock
price isn’t showing this despiration yet. If I were a market gambler
this might be something I’d try to capitalize on.

<p>Howard Oakley: All storage media, including memory, SSDs and rotating
hard disks, can develop fragmentation, but most serious attention has
been paid to the problem on hard disks. This is because of their
electro-mechanical mechanism for seeking to locations on the spinning
platter they use for storage. To read a fragmented file sequentially,

Left with Heavy Fees by Copyright Troll Law Firm</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-11, from: Authors Union blogs</p>
<p>The final outcome of the case: the plaintiff was ordered to cover
$102,404 in fees and $165.72 in costs for the defendant. This should
serve as a cautionary tale for would-be plaintiffs: copyright lawsuits,
like any other type of litigation, are primarily meant to address the
damages plaintiffs actually suffered, and the final settlement should
make plaintiffs whole again—that is, as if no infringement has ever
occurred. Copyright lawsuits (or the threat to sue) should not be
undertaken as a way to create brand new income streams. </p>
