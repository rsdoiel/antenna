## Quoting Jack Clark

<p>For comparison, the James Webb telescope cost $10bn, so Microsoft is spending eight James Webb telescopes in one year just on AI.</p>
<p>For a further comparison, people think the long-in-development ITER fusion reactor will cost between $40bn and $70bn once developed (and it’s shaping up to be a 20-30 year project), so Microsoft is spending more than the sum total of humanity’s biggest fusion bet <em>in one year</em> on AI.</p></blockquote>

## Mac tip of the day: OCR

date: 2025-01-20, from: Status-Q blog

I remember one of the features that first attracted me to the Mac, back around the turn of the millennium, was its pervasive support for PDFs. On Windows, I&#8217;d had to install cumbersome Adobe software to convert certain formats into PDF documents. On the Mac, any app that could print could create PDFs without the <a class="more-link excerpt-link" href="https://statusq.org/archives/2025/01/20/12373/">Continue Reading<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span></a>

## Episode 150 - Starting Windows Up

date: 2025-01-20, from: Advent of Computing

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">In the modern day Windows is a power house, but that wasn't always the case. In this episode we are looking at the fraught development of Windows 1.0. During development it was called vaporware, it was panned in the press, roasted at at least one trade show, and even called... "eclectic". Through it all a vision in lime green would take form.</p>

## I shook Elon Musk warmly by the hand…

## TIL: Downloading every video for a TikTok account

date: 2025-01-19, updated: 2025-01-19, from: Simon Willison’s Weblog

<p><strong><a href="https://til.simonwillison.net/tiktok/download-all-videos">TIL: Downloading every video for a TikTok account</a></strong></p>
TikTok may or may not be banned in the USA within the next 24 hours or so. I figured out a gnarly pattern for downloading every video from a specified account, using browser console JavaScript to scrape the video URLs and <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> to fetch each video. As a bonus, I included a recipe for generating a Whisper transcript of every video with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-whisper/">mlx-whisper</a> and a hacky way to show a progress bar for the downloads.
