## Corporate dealmaking is “in” for 2024

date: 2024-01-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Globally, the total value of mergers and acquisitions last year was the lowest since in a decade, held back by interest rates, a volatile stock market and a strict regulatory environment. The corporate dealmaking could rebound this year, though. We&#8217;ll also paint a picture of our economic moment with a slew of recent data. Plus, could passwords be a thing of the past?</p>

**@Dave Winer's Scripting News** (date: 2024-01-18, from: Dave Winer's Scripting News)

BTW, did you notice how BMW's ads say their product is much better than Tesla's, without mentioning Tesla, they just say they're better, because they are just better, because they're BMW, and they know you know that. It's much more powerful esp with people who like Telsas (of which I am one). I also see the Tesla as a very capable replacement for my 2007 BMW 535i, which I donated to charity in 2012, which I loved for the same reasons I love the Tesla. Putting down the competition isn't what marketing is about, you have to think about the people whose minds you're trying to change, and know you're in it for the long haul.

## Pluralistic: Demon-haunted computers are back, baby (17 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-18, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links Demon-haunted computers are back, baby: Surely no one will ever find a way to abuse this security system that treats the computer's owner as an attacker. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading Demon-haunted computers are back, baby (permalink) As a science fiction writer, I am professionally irritated by a lot of sf movies. Not only do those writers get paid a lot more than I do, they insist on including things like "self-destruct" buttons on the bridges of their starships. Look, I get it. When the evil empire is closing in on your flagship with its secret transdimensional technology, it's important that you keep those secrets out of the emperor's hand. An irrevocable self-destruct switch there on the bridge gets the job done! (It has to be irrevocable, otherwise the baddies'll just swarm the bridge and toggle it off). But c'mon. If there's a facility built into your spaceship that causes it to explode no matter what the people on the bridge do, that is also a pretty big security risk! What if the bad guy figures out how to hijack the measure that &#8211; by design &#8211; the people who depend on the spaceship as a matter of life and death can't detect or override? I mean, sure, you can try to simplify that self-destruct system to make it easier to audit and assure yourself that it doesn't have any bugs in it, but remember Schneier's Law: anyone can design a security system that works so well that they themselves can't think of a flaw in it. That doesn't mean you've made a security system that works &#8211; only that you've made a security system that works on people stupider than you. I know it's weird to be worried about realism in movies that pretend we will ever find a practical means to visit other star systems and shuttle back and forth between them (which we are very, very unlikely to do): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/09/astrobezzle/#send-robots-instead But this kind of foolishness galls me. It galls me even more when it happens in the real world of technology design, which is why I've spent the past quarter-century being very cross about Digital Rights Management in general, and trusted computing in particular. It all starts in 2002, when a team from Microsoft visited our offices at EFF to tell us about this new thing they'd dreamed up called "trusted computing": https://pluralistic.net/2020/12/05/trusting-trust/#thompsons-devil The big idea was to stick a second computer inside your computer, a very secure little co-processor, that you couldn't access directly, let alone reprogram or interfere with. As far as this "trusted platform module" was concerned, you were the enemy. The "trust" in trusted computing was about other people being able to trust your computer, even if they didn't trust you. So that little TPM would do all kinds of cute tricks. It could observe and produce a cryptographically signed manifest of the entire boot-chain of your computer, which was meant to be an unforgeable certificate attesting to which kind of computer you were running and what software you were running on it. That meant that programs on other computers could decide whether to talk to your computer based on whether they agreed with your choices about which code to run. This process, called "remote attestation," is generally billed as a way to identify and block computers that have been compromised by malware, or to identify gamers who are running cheats and refuse to play with them. But inevitably it turns into a way to refuse service to computers that have privacy blockers turned on, or are running stream-ripping software, or whose owners are blocking ads: https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/02/self-incrimination/#wei-bai-bai After all, a system that treats the device's owner as an adversary is a natural ally for the owner's other, human adversaries. The rubric for treating the owner as an adversary focuses on the way that users can be fooled by bad people with bad programs. If your computer gets taken over by malicious software, that malware might intercept queries from your antivirus program and send it false data that lulls it into thinking your computer is fine, even as your private data is being plundered and your system is being used to launch malware attacks on others. These separate, non-user-accessible, non-updateable secure systems serve a nubs of certainty, a remote fortress that observes and faithfully reports on the interior workings of your computer. This separate system can't be user-modifiable or field-updateable, because then malicious software could impersonate the user and disable the security chip. It's true that compromised computers are a real and terrifying problem. Your computer is privy to your most intimate secrets and an attacker who can turn it against you can harm you in untold ways. But the widespread redesign of out computers to treat us as their enemies gives rise to a range of completely predictable and &#8211; I would argue &#8211; even worse harms. Building computers that treat their owners as untrusted parties is a system that works well, but fails badly. First of all, there are the ways that trusted computing is designed to hurt you. The most reliable way to enshittify something is to supply it over a computer that runs programs you can't alter, and that rats you out to third parties if you run counter-programs that disenshittify the service you're using. That's how we get inkjet printers that refuse to use perfectly good third-party ink and cars that refuse to accept perfectly good engine repairs if they are performed by third-party mechanics: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon It's how we get cursed devices and appliances, from the juicer that won't squeeze third-party juice to the insulin pump that won't connect to a third-party continuous glucose monitor: https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/unauthorized-bread-a-near-future-tale-of-refugees-and-sinister-iot-appliances/ But trusted computing doesn't just create an opaque veil between your computer and the programs you use to inspect and control it. Trusted computing creates a no-go zone where programs can change their behavior based on whether they think they're being observed. The most prominent example of this is Dieselgate, where auto manufacturers murdered hundreds of people by gimmicking their cars to emit illegal amount of NOX. Key to Dieselgate was a program that sought to determine whether it was being observed by regulators (it checked for the telltale signs of the standard test-suite) and changed its behavior to color within the lines. Software that is seeking to harm the owner of the device that's running it must be able to detect when it is being run inside a simulation, a test-suite, a virtual machine, or any other hallucinatory virtual world. Just as Descartes couldn't know whether anything was real until he assured himself that he could trust his senses, malware is always questing to discover whether it is running in the real universe, or in a simulation created by a wicked god: https://pluralistic.net/2022/07/28/descartes-was-an-optimist/#uh-oh That's why mobile malware uses clever gambits like periodically checking for readings from your device's accelerometer, on the theory that a virtual mobile phone running on a security researcher's test bench won't have the fidelity to generate plausible jiggles to match the real data that comes from a phone in your pocket: https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/01/google-play-malware-used-phones-motion-sensors-to-conceal-itself/ Sometimes this backfires in absolutely delightful ways. When the Wannacry ransomware was holding the world hostage, the security researcher Marcus Hutchins noticed that its code made reference to a very weird website: iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com. Hutchins stood up a website at that address and every Wannacry-infection in the world went instantly dormant: https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#the-matrix It turns out that Wannacry's authors were using that ferkakte URL the same way that mobile malware authors were using accelerometer readings &#8211; to fulfill Descartes' imperative to distinguish the Matrix from reality. The malware authors knew that security researchers often ran malicious code inside sandboxes that answered every network query with fake data in hopes of eliciting responses that could be analyzed for weaknesses. So the Wannacry worm would periodically poll this nonexistent website and, if it got an answer, it would assume that it was being monitored by a security researcher and it would retreat to an encrypted blob, ceasing to operate lest it give intelligence to the enemy. When Hutchins put a webserver up at iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com, every Wannacry instance in the world was instantly convinced that it was running on an enemy's simulator and withdrew into sulky hibernation. The arms race to distinguish simulation from reality is critical and the stakes only get higher by the day. Malware abounds, even as our devices grow more intimately woven through our lives. We put our bodies into computers &#8211; cars, buildings &#8211; and computers inside our bodies. We absolutely want our computers to be able to faithfully convey what's going on inside them. But we keep running as hard as we can in the opposite direction, leaning harder into secure computing models built on subsystems in our computers that treat us as the threat. Take UEFI, the ubiquitous security system that observes your computer's boot process, halting it if it sees something it doesn't approve of. On the one hand, this has made installing GNU/Linux and other alternative OSes vastly harder across a wide variety of devices. This means that when a vendor end-of-lifes a gadget, no one can make an alternative OS for it, so off the landfill it goes. It doesn't help that UEFI &#8211; and other trusted computing modules &#8211; are covered by Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which makes it a felony to publish information that can bypass or weaken the system. The threat of a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine means that UEFI and other trusted computing systems are understudied, leaving them festering with longstanding bugs: https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/09/free-sample/#que-viva Here's where it gets really bad. If an attacker can get inside UEFI, they can run malicious software that &#8211; by design &#8211; no program running on our computers can detect or block. That badware is running in "Ring -1" &#8211; a zone of privilege that overrides the operating system itself. Here's the bad news: UEFI malware has already been detected in the wild: https://securelist.com/cosmicstrand-uefi-firmware-rootkit/106973/ And here's the worst news: researchers have just identified another exploitable UEFI bug, dubbed Pixiefail: https://blog.quarkslab.com/pixiefail-nine-vulnerabilities-in-tianocores-edk-ii-ipv6-network-stack.html Writing in Ars Technica, Dan Goodin breaks down Pixiefail, describing how anyone on the same LAN as a vulnerable computer can infect its firmware: https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/new-uefi-vulnerabilities-send-firmware-devs-across-an-entire-ecosystem-scrambling/ That vulnerability extends to computers in a data-center where the attacker has a cloud computing instance. PXE &#8211; the system that Pixiefail attacks &#8211; isn't widely used in home or office environments, but it's very common in data-centers. Again, once a computer is exploited with Pixiefail, software running on that computer can't detect or delete the Pixiefail code. When the compromised computer is queried by the operating system, Pixiefail undetectably lies to the OS. "Hey, OS, does this drive have a file called 'pixiefail?'" "Nope." "Hey, OS, are you running a process called 'pixiefail?'" "Nope." This is a self-destruct switch that's been compromised by the enemy, and which no one on the bridge can de-activate &#8211; by design. It's not the first time this has happened, and it won't be the last. There are models for helping your computer bust out of the Matrix. Back in 2016, Edward Snowden and bunnie Huang prototyped and published source code and schematics for an "introspection engine": https://assets.pubpub.org/aacpjrja/AgainstTheLaw-CounteringLawfulAbusesofDigitalSurveillance.pdf This is a single-board computer that lives in an ultraslim shim that you slide between your iPhone's mainboard and its case, leaving a ribbon cable poking out of the SIM slot. This connects to a case that has its own OLED display. The board has leads that physically contact each of the network interfaces on the phone, conveying any data they transit to the screen so that you can observe the data your phone is sending without having to trust your phone. (I liked this gadget so much that I included it as a major plot point in my 2020 novel Attack Surface, the third book in the Little Brother series): https://craphound.com/attacksurface/ We don't have to cede control over our devices in order to secure them. Indeed, we can't ever secure them unless we can control them. Self-destruct switches don't belong on the bridge of your spaceship, and trusted computing modules don't belong in your devices.

## What a Trump Victory Could Mean for Climate Policy

date: 2024-01-18, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDM0MDAwMC9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2ODQzODE2Nn0.7qLtGHwtvJDuHPOt-W4Ue-pqu3d_1ggV3S7sxzg1utg/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C1%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/><p>
<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Parts of Indonesia are under water due to heavy rainfall • Tree branches are heavy with ice in Oregon • A no-burn alert is in place for Southern California as an atmospheric “lid” locks in smog.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Kerry warns U.S. election stakes for climate policy are ‘as high as they can get’</h3><p>
	As election season heats up and a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=4db794fb87&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">certain bombastic former president</a> looks to take back the White House in November, conversation has turned to what a second Trump presidency could mean for climate policy. Trump has promised to <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=b1e6defe64&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">gut the Inflation Reduction Act</a> and <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5f35df938f&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cut funding for climate adaptation</a> in poorer countries, among other things. What would his return really mean for the climate movement on a national and global scale? Here’s a quick opinion roundup:
</p><ul>
<li><strong>The stakes couldn’t be higher: </strong>Trump won’t be able to stop the green energy transition that’s already underway, but he could slow it down, U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry told <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=0ea1ef1b12&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg TV</a>. “The marketplace is going to support this transition and it’s irrevocable now — we’re going to get there. The only question is if we’re going to get there in time to not be ravaged by the worst consequences of the climate crisis.”</li>
<li><strong>Gutting the IRA would be very unpopular: </strong>Many clean-energy programs funded by President Biden’s signature climate bill are in red states, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=67e5d1cca6&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted <em>The Economist</em></a>. If Trump nixes them, “he may face pushback from his own party,” not to mention business leaders. Some automakers, like GM and Nissan, are already warning against the move.</li>
<li><strong>Trump can’t stop the global momentum:</strong> Of course the U.S. president’s views on climate matter, but “the world’s in a slightly different place than it was five years ago,” World Bank President Ajay Banga <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e8a7b3af3d&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told <em>Politico</em></a>. The bank helps finance climate adaptation in developing countries, and is pushing for more private sector investment in renewables. Banga suggested international momentum on these issues is “much bigger than just the U.S. and the EU.”</li>
</ul><p>
<strong>Side note:</strong> New <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a8bf1d994b&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> from the University of Colorado at Boulder <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e34a0e0a6c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">concludes</a> that concerns about climate change have “a significant and growing effect on voting that favors the Democrats” and “that climate change opinion probably cost Republicans the 2020 presidential election, all else being equal.”
</p><h3>2. The South smashes electricity records</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Tennessee Valley Authority, America’s largest public power company, just set a new record for electricity usage thanks to the cold weather system hammering huge sections of the country, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=7403f5b09c&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports <em>Heatmap</em>’s Matthew Zeitlin</a>. Consumers used around 34,500 megawatts of electricity yesterday morning, about 1,000 megawatts more than its previous all-time record of around 33,500 megawatts in August 2007. Like much of the region, Tennesseans largely heat their homes using electricity as opposed to fuel oil or natural gas. Cold mornings are particularly challenging for the authority because lots of people are trying to heat their chilly homes between waking up and going to work or school. “By contrast, summer afternoons and early evenings are tough for grids to manage because temperatures stay high even as the sun goes down and people return to their homes and cool them and start operating appliances,” Zeitlin explains. The cold snap is expected to last through the weekend.
</p><h3>3. Study: Greenland is losing way more ice than experts thought </h3><p>
<strong></strong>The Greenland ice sheet has lost 20% more ice than scientists previously thought due to global warming, according to new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=56b8a3ebbd&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. The researchers came to this conclusion by looking at the amount of glacial ice lost around the edges of the sheet, an area that earlier estimates overlooked. Experts worry the huge amounts of fresh water pouring into the north Atlantic could disrupt ocean currents and wreak havoc on global weather patterns.

<strong></strong>Butterflies may lose their spotty wings thanks to climate change, scientists say. The new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1088fc7ce2&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> focuses on female meadow brown butterflies, and finds that insects that developed in warmer temperatures had fewer spots than those that developed in cooler weather. "This is an unexpected consequence of climate change,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=dc8c32b09a&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Richard ffrench-Constant, a professor of molecular natural history at the University of Exeter in the U.K. “We tend to think about species moving north, rather than changing appearance."
</p><h3>5. Scientists urge swift climate action ahead of EU elections</h3><p>
<strong></strong>The European Union needs to double down on plans to phase out fossil fuels and implement green policies if it wants to reach its 2050 net zero targets, a <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=5ae9a63ee0&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change said. "The EU needs to sharply decrease the use of fossil fuels, and almost fully phase out the use of coal and fossil gas in public electricity and heat generation by 2040," the advisers said. The report urges the EU to work quickly to put planned climate policies into law. The timing of the report is interesting because, as the <em>Financial Times </em><a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=3ba4995c02&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">explained</a>, the EU faces parliamentary elections this summer, “when rightwing parties that want to slow the pace of progress are expected to focus on rhetoric about the social costs of switching away from fossil fuels to combat climate change.”
</p><h2>THE KICKER</h2><p>
<em>“As the EV transition continues, we are going to have to think about [EVs] more as products, as specific tools that can improve someone’s life by their presence.”</em> –<em>Heatmap</em>’s Robinson Meyer on <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=abfdb03946&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the secrets to selling electric cars</a>

Consumers like that they&#8217;re able to spend less money than they would on a dinner out while still feeling like they&#8217;re treating themselves. Meanwhile, restaurants love the profit margins. Also on this morning&#8217;s show: flipping through the pages of the Beige Book and analyzing the average workweek in China.</p>

## A rare corruption scandal hits Singapore

date: 2024-01-18, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p><em>From the BBC World Service:</em> Singapore’s transport minister has resigned after facing multiple charges of corruption; it&#8217;s alleged he took kickbacks worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, something he denies. Also, passwords could soon be a thing of the past as companies like Google introduce &#8220;passkeys&#8221; as a default login for online users. But with the rise of deepfake technology, is any method of verifying our identities completely secure?</p>

<blockquote><p>[Judge] Carter said the investigation can continue without the phones, and he noted that Ottawa police have made a formal request to obtain more data from Google.</p>

## Evangelicals for Trump? It's Not About Religion

date: 2024-01-18, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Right after his victory in Iowa, where he received 53% of the evangelical and born-again Christian vote, Donald Trump traveled to New York to plead his case &#8212; literally. He was in federal court today, where he&#8217;ll soon find out how much he&#8217;ll have to pay for defaming a woman he&#8217;s also been found liable for sexually abusing. You may want to think about that for a moment. And let us remember it&#8217;s only January. There are more trials to come starring the leading GOP presidential candidate.

## Analysts: Pyongyang Tries To Create Seoul-Tokyo Friction to Harm US Relations

date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA

washington — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is trying to create friction between Tokyo and Seoul, South Korea, and undermine their trilateral relations with the United States as security cooperation among them deepens, analysts said.  


Washington, Seoul and Tokyo conducted trilateral naval drills in the international waters south of Jeju Island from Monday to Wednesday, said South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).   


The exercises involving nine ships, including the USS Carl Vinson, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, were aimed at enhancing deterrence against North Korean nuclear, missile and underwater threats, the JCS said. 


North Korea is taking an increasingly hostile stance toward South Korea. Calling for the amendment of its constitution to refer to South Korea as its "principal enemy," Kim said Pyongyang should plan for occupying South Korea if war breaks out.   




He made the remarks in a speech on Monday to the Supreme Assembly, the country's rubber-stamp parliament, said state media KCNA. 


A day earlier, North Korea test-fired what it said was a solid fuel intermediate range ballistic missile with a hypersonic warhead.




Pyongyang also fired more than 200 rounds of artillery shells near Yeonpyeong Island on a disputed maritime border with South Korea on January 5 and more than 60 rounds near the same island on January 7. Yeonpyeong Island is about 120 kilometers west of Seoul. 


While escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula, Kim sent a message to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on January 5 conveying sympathy over a powerful earthquake that shook Ishikawa prefecture, leaving at least 200 people dead and more than 200 missing as the new year began.  




In the message, Kim expressed "his deep sympathy and condolences" to Kishida for losses caused by the earthquake, KCNA reported on January 6.  


Analysts said although North Korea has relayed condolence messages to Japan after disasters in the past, this is the first time Kim personally reached out to a Japanese prime minister.


"While Kim Jong Un may wish to drive a wedge between Japan and the ROK, the real intention, subtle but still real, is to drive a wedge between Japan and America, in spite of last year's successes at Camp David in the trilateral summit," said Kenneth Dekleva, a senior fellow at the George H.W. Bush Foundation for U.S.-China Relations.


At the Camp David summit, U.S. President Joe Biden, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Kishida agreed to cooperate on multiple measures to bolster deterrence against North Korea.




Dekleva, who served as a State Department psychiatrist analyzing foreign leaders including Kim from 2006 to 2016, continued, "Another intention of equal importance is to test the U.S.-ROK relationship, especially given the recent dangerous, bellicose threats of war made recently by Kim Jong Un."  


Kim ordered his military forces to prepare for war with the U.S. and "South Korean puppets and Japs," according to KCNA, describing Kim's speech made at a planning meeting of his ruling Workers' Party on December 31.




Pyongyang has been critical of the trilateral ties forged after Seoul and Tokyo mended relations in March. Disputes rooted in Japan's colonization of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 had strained relations for decades.  


Ken Gause, an expert on North Korea's leadership and political system at the Center for Naval Analyses,  said Kim's message also signals Pyongyang could be "keeping its options open for engagement."  


"North Korea is trying to put Japan in a situation where it has to choose between its own self-interest and the self-interest of the alliance as a whole," he said.  


Kishida said in May that he is willing to meet Kim to discuss the return of Japanese who were abducted by North Korea in the 1960s and 1970s.  


At North Korea's summit with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in September 2002, Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, admitted the country had abducted 12 Japanese nationals. North Korea returned five of them to Japan in October of that year. 


Japan says North Korea abducted 17 Japanese citizens in the 1970s to 1980s.  


Shihoko Goto, Asia program director at the Wilson Center, said, "The abduction issue remains a highly emotional agenda in Japan, and moving forward to seek a resolution is high on the agenda of Kishida's government." 




She added that Kim's message of condolence "was seen favorably in Tokyo and seen as an opportunity for greater dialogue, if not improved relations, between the two countries." 


However, she said, Tokyo will be "in lockstep" with Seoul and Washington in deterring North Korea, as Pyongyang also is "an existential threat" to Japan.

## Lichee Console 4A, RISC-V mini laptop: review, benchmarks and early issues

date: 2024-01-18, from: OS News

I always liked small laptops and phones &#8211; but for some reason they fell out of favor of manufacturers (&#8220;bigger is more better&#8221;). Now if one wanted to get tiny laptop &#8211; one of the few opportunities would have been to fight for old Sony UMPC&#8217;s on ebay which are somewhat expensive even today. Recently Raspberry Pi/CM4-based tiny laptops started to appear &#8211; especially clockwork products are neat, but they are not foldable like a laptop. When in summer of 2023 Sipeed announced Lichee Console 4A based on RISC-V SoC &#8211; I preordered it immediately and in early January I finally received it. Results of my testing, currently uncovered issues are below. ↫ Mikhail Svarichevsky I want one of these.

## Frigid Weather Compounds Chicago's Struggles to House Asylum-Seekers

date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA

chicago — As temperatures hover below freezing in Chicago, dozens of asylum-seekers are staying in the lower level of a library until the bitter cold gripping much of the country lifts. 


But after that, Chicago's plans for offering immediate shelter to the growing number of migrants arriving in the nation's third-largest city remain murky. 


For more than a year, Chicago has wrestled with how to house new arrivals until shelter space is free, utilizing measures that city leaders insist are a stopgap. Last week, it was parked city buses. Before that it was police station lobbies and airports. The makeshift approach has frazzled volunteers, nonprofit groups and migrants wary of the lack of a long-term plan, particularly during the city's long winters. 


"The city's favorite word for everything is 'temporary,'" said Vianney Marzullo, a volunteer who has helped migrants staying at O'Hare International Airport. "It's their new choice of Band-Aid word. Everything is temporary, temporary, temporary." 




Chicago has struggled, like New York and Denver, to deal with the crisis that started in 2022 when migrants began arriving in Democratic-led cities, largely at the direction of Texas Governot Greg Abbott. The winter weather has further complicated efforts. Last week, New York, which has received more than 170,000 migrants, evacuated a massive tent camp ahead of a storm. Big-city mayors have asked repeatedly for more federal help. 


Chicago's response has stood out for its haphazard approach with a heavy reliance on volunteers who have spent more than a year providing medical care, food and donated items. 


City leaders say the situation keeps changing and there have been snags along the way. 


Mayor Brandon Johnson floated the idea of a heated tent encampment, but construction was scrapped over the risk of contaminants at the former industrial site. 


The city had instituted a 60-day limit for shelter stays but pushed the first batch of notices off to next week because of the weather. Meanwhile, the city has been heavily criticized for conditions at its shelters and the death of a young boy whose family stayed at one. 


The political fight has also heated up and spread to the suburbs. 


Abbott's busing operation has been dropping off migrants at all hours in different Chicago area cities without coordination. When the city began fining bus companies and filing lawsuits, Abbott fired back with chartered planes. Johnson had planned a summit for this week with suburban mayors to discuss the problem; it was canceled by the weather. His office didn't return a request for comment Wednesday. 


"This is an international crisis that requires federal intervention of which local government is subsidizing that work. Never designed to do it, but yet here we are still standing," Johnson said last week ahead of the storm. 




Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker also wrote to Abbott last week asking to suspend buses until the temperatures rise and with many migrants arriving without winter coats or shoes. But Abbott rejected the notion, saying the federal government needs to step up. 


More than 33,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, have arrived in Chicago since 2022. Currently, nearly 15,000 migrants are living in 28 shelters and the city is continually opening more. Many migrants have gone elsewhere or live with family and friends in the area. Chicago, like other cities, has offered bus tickets out of the city. 


The city wound down its much-maligned use of police stations to house migrants, but O'Hare International Airport is still being used, with some asylum-seekers staying for weeks at a time as they await shelter. More than 200 were there Wednesday, according to the city. 


Until the weather turned, the city was keeping migrants aboard eight city buses that were running continuously and parked near a downtown highway in an area designated "the landing zone." 


Six heated tents are under construction nearby, which the city says will be used for intake and services, such as medical care. It's unclear if they will also be used for housing. 


Marylin Gonzalez, 34, slept on the buses last week along with her husband and three children, ages 15, 16 and 18. The buses were crowded, with sicknesses spreading quickly. 




Gonzalez described the atmosphere aboard as tense, with many worried about where they would go. She said it made her feel like a prisoner. 


"The children are stressed. People get stressed, they argue, they are already desperate," she said. "Sometimes we have to sleep sitting up because there is no space to lay down." 


Outside the buses, many would take up activities, like throwing around a football, to keep warm. 


The landing zone was cleared of people and vehicles on Monday, but by Wednesday morning, the empty warming buses were parked there again, a signal that the city intends to return to using them. The city's Office of Emergency Management didn't respond to questions Wednesday about the city's plans when the weather warms. 


Roughly 50 migrants were staying in the lower level of the Harold Washington Library Center, the city's flagship location downtown during the cold snap, according to people staying there. Migrants, including those who came in on their own to avoid the cold, were living with others facing homelessness. According to the city's tally, 5 migrants at the library site were on lists for shelters. An Associated Press reporter was not allowed inside. 


Angel Alberto Chourio, 30, slept there over the weekend, saying he was trying to figure out his next steps. He and a friend arrived from Venezuela last year. The promise of work out of state didn't pan out, so they came back to Chicago recently. Without any place else to go, they came to the library. 


He said Wednesday that he was nervous about the shelter stay limits and was not on a waiting list for one. 


"We are not used to this. The cold is too much, since it is already below zero," he said, looking for a silver lining. "At least they give one a chance to continue living."

## Biden Convenes Top Congressional Leaders to Discuss Ukraine Aid, US Border Deal

date: 2024-01-18, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden convened top congressional leaders at the White House to underscore Ukraine's security needs, a meeting that comes at a pivotal time as senators narrow on a landmark immigration deal that could unlock $110 billion in stalled aid to Ukraine, Israel and other U.S. allies.


But Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans used the face-to-face moment with Biden to push him for tougher border security measures, with the speaker telling the president that Republican lawmakers were demanding "substantive policy change" and insisting that the White House's executive actions on immigration had weakened the border.




"We understand that there's concern about the safety, security and sovereignty of Ukraine," Johnson told reporters after the meeting, which ran for more than an hour. "But the American people have those same concerns about our own domestic sovereignty and our safety and our security."


Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, also speaking to reporters after the meeting, stressed that Biden has repeatedly said he is willing to compromise on certain border measures and that any effort in a divided Congress must be bipartisan. House Republicans have insisted on passage of a hard-line border security measure that has no Democratic support on Capitol Hill.


"There was a large amount of agreement around the table that we must do Ukraine, and we must do border," he said.


The White House called the meeting with lawmakers — including Johnson, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell — to brief them on Ukraine's current need for weapons and other aid, which the White House described as "desperate" and "urgent."


By populating the meeting with national security leaders, the meeting was expected to impress on the new speaker the importance of the aid package and the current U.S. approach to world affairs. The Republicans in the room, even Johnson, are largely supportive of aiding Ukraine but have stressed to the White House that it will need significant border-security measures in return to persuade the large swath of rank-and-file Republican lawmakers skeptical about sending more funds abroad.


"He's willing to hear what these congressional members want to talk about, but the purpose of this meeting is to talk about Ukraine," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said ahead of the mid-afternoon gathering, which was held in the Cabinet Room.


Key time to convene


Biden is convening the lawmakers at the start of an election year when border security and the wars abroad are punctuating the race for the White House as he faces a potential rematch against Republican Donald Trump with control of the presidency and Congress all at stake.


It comes as Congress is about to quickly approve temporary funding to avoid a government shutdown — postponing the annual spending battles — but as the supplemental aid package sits undone during the immigration and border talks.


Biden, a longtime leader in U.S. foreign policy, finds himself confronting a new generation of Republican lawmakers who have little interest in engaging abroad or supporting vast American military aid or actions around the world.


Led by Trump, the former president who is the Republicans' front-runner for the nomination, a growing number of the Republicans in Congress are particularly hostile to helping Ukraine fight Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion.


U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who along with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met this week with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in Davos, Switzerland, said Washington is determined to keep supporting Ukraine, and "we're working very closely with Congress in order to do that."


Ahead of the meeting, McConnell announced the package could be ready for a vote as soon as next week, and Schumer sounded a similarly optimistic note — though negotiations continue.


Senators develop border proposal


Johnson, since taking the gavel in October, signaled he personally believes in supporting Ukraine as it works to expel Russia. He met privately with Zelenskyy during the Ukrainian president's whirlwind tour of Washington last month seeking aid before the year-end holidays.


But the speaker leads an ambivalent House Republican majority that wants to extract its own priorities on the U.S.-Mexico border in exchange for any overseas support.


The speaker has insisted any border security deal must align with the House-passed strict border security bill. He told lawmakers in a private meeting over the weekend that they could probably get their priorities enacted with a Republican president, though the speaker did not mean that to preclude not taking action now, said a Republican leadership aide familiar with the call.


But senators, even fellow Republicans, said the House approach is a nonstarter that would never find the bipartisan backing in both chambers needed for approval.


Instead, a core group of senators led by Republican James Lankford has been meeting privately for weeks with Biden's top advisers — including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas — to develop a border security package that could actually be signed into law.


Lankford told reporters late Tuesday that he hopes to prepare bill text as negotiations try to wrap up soon.


McConnell told Republican senators privately last week they should take the deal Lankford is producing, according to a person granted anonymity to discuss the closed meeting.


"This is a unique moment in time," said the Number 2 Republican John Thune.


"It's an opportunity to get some really conservative border policy that we haven't been able to get for 40 years," he said. "And so we'll see. I mean, it may or may not happen, but I think you got to take a run at it."


Senator 'hopeful'


The broader security package includes about $60 billion for Ukraine, which is mainly used to purchase U.S. weaponry to fight the war and to shore up its own government operations, along with some $14.5 billion for Israel, about $14 billion for border security, and additional funds for other security needs.


Biden opened the door to a broader U.S.-Mexico border security package late last year and the changes being discussed could be difficult for some Democrats who oppose strict restrictions on immigration.


Schumer said negotiations over the border security package have made progress in recent weeks and he was "hopeful that things are headed in the right direction."


Schumer said he expects the meeting with Biden will reinforce that the national security package is urgent and "any agreement on an issue as complex and contentious as the border is going to have to have support from both sides of the aisle."

## Do users write more insecure code with AI assistants?

date: 2024-01-18, from: OS News

AI code assistants have emerged as powerful tools that can aid in the software development life-cycle and can improve developer productivity. Unfortunately, such assistants have also been found to produce insecure code in lab environments, raising significant concerns about their usage in practice. In this paper, we conduct a user study to examine how users interact with AI code assistants to solve a variety of security related tasks. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those without access to an assistant. Participants with access to an AI assistant were also more likely to believe they wrote secure code, suggesting that such tools may lead users to be overconfident about security flaws in their code. To better inform the design of future AI-based code assistants, we release our user-study apparatus and anonymized data to researchers seeking to build on our work at this link. ↫ Neil Perry, Megha Srivastava, Deepak Kumar, and Dan Boneh I&#8217;m surprised somewhat randomly copying other people&#8217;s code into your program &#8211; violating their licenses, to boot &#8211; leads to crappier code.

## From 0 to 1 MB in DOS

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

Since the last article on the text-based IDEs of old, I’ve been meaning to write about the GCC port to DOS, namely DJGPP. As I worked on the draft for that topic, I realized that there is a ton of ground to cover to set the stage so I took most of the content on memory management out and wrote this separate post. This article is a deep dive on how DOS had to pull out tricks maximize the use of the very limited 1 MB address space of the 8086. Those tricks could exist because of the features later introduced by the 80286 and the 80386, but these were just clutches to paper over the fact that DOS could not leverage the real improvements provided by protected mode. ↫ Julio Merino The DOS memory story is a string of hacks upon hacks that somehow managed to work &#8211; and that still work today.

While the two companies are technically independent, Hyundai owns about a third of Kia Motors, and they collaborate on vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing. They also use the same vehicle “platforms,” a common set of parts that can be used across models.</p><p>Since the news came out last week, I’ve seen climate people on Twitter and elsewhere try to explain why it’s happening. Many of these explanations conform to the views that the urban, progressive climate commentariat already hold about the car market. <em>Look, Hyundai and Kia are winning because they’re making smaller cars, not behemoth SUVs. </em></p><p>But the answer, while not quite the opposite, doesn’t line up with what many might wish. In fact, Hyundai and Kia are dominating the EV market right now by churning out a mostly unbroken stream of crossover and SUVs. All but one of their electric cars qualifies as an SUV or crossover; all of their plug-in hybrids are SUVs. It is this commitment to repetition — to giving the consumer a lot of choices on a central theme — that sets their product lines apart right now. </p><p>You can see the importance of this by looking at their models in more depth. Take the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Kia EV6, for instance, which have led EV sales at the two brands and which are <a href="https://www.topspeed.com/the-real-differences-between-the-kia-ev6-and-hyundai-ioniq-5/#:~:text=Both%20the%20EV6%20and%20the,fastest%2Dcharging%20EVs%20currently%20available." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">built on the same platform</a>. Each is an electrified take on the type of car that, for years now, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/how-the-crossover-conquered-americas-automobile-market/374061/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Americans haven’t been able to get enough of</a>: the compact crossover SUV. The Ioniq 5 and EV6 each have two rows of seating and 25 cubic feet of trunk space. They drive more or less like a car, sit high on the road like an SUV, and fall in the broad category of cars that — as a friend’s wife puts it — looks <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a36715409/why-does-every-new-car-look-like-every-other-new-car/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">like a fist with its thumb stuck out</a>.</p><p>The Ioniq 5 and EV6 are also really, really similar to the Mustang Mach E, Ford’s attempt at an electric crossover. In fact, if you look <em>only</em> at specs, they’re basically the same car. All three have the same length and width and take up about 95 square feet of road space. All three have five seats. All three have roughly the same size trunk, although the Ford’s is maybe slightly bigger. And all three have an entry-level model starting at about $42,000 — although the lowest trim Ford has slightly more range and horsepower, and costs about a grand more.</p><p>As you might expect from those specs, the Mach E narrowly outsold the Ioniq 5 and EV6 in the United States last year. Ford sold more than 40,000 Mach Es in 2023, while Hyundai moved nearly 34,000 Ioniq 5s and Kia sold 19,000 EV6s. But here’s the thing: The Mach E did not outsell the Ioniq 5 and EV6 <em>combined. </em>And unlike Ford, which only sells one electric SUV, Hyundai and Kia continued to flood the zone with SUV options for consumers. </p><p>How many options? Hyundai sold <a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/electrified/plug-in-hybrids" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plug-in versions</a> of its Tuscon and Santa Fe SUVs. Kia sold an electric version of its subcompact Niro SUV and a plug-in hybrid version of its Sportage SUV. And even though Kia only <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/698888/kia-ev9-ev6-sales-us-november2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">started selling</a> its new three-row SUV, the EV9, in December, it had already delivered more than 1,000 of them by the end of the year.</p><p>In fact, only <em>one</em> electric car from Hyundai-Kia — the new Ioniq 6 — was designed like a traditional sedan. But it made up only around 8% of the alliance’s total sales. Hyundai and Kia achieved their commanding position by giving Americans what they want: a seemingly endless stream of SUVs and crossovers.</p><p>Now, it matters here that Kia and Hyundai are two different companies, so there is some automatic duplication in their product lines. It might never make sense for Ford or GM to sell cars as similar as the EV6 and Ioniq 5. But if we’re being honest, their SUV lineups are already <a href="https://www.ford.com/new-suvs-crossovers/?gclid=CjwKCAiAkp6tBhB5EiwANTCx1G_ek-lL-QZt-HolZn3jRnrEDpHUTqA0dzl22f6i4FEY8mXRXWIrWRoCnu8QAvD_BwE&searchid=20393971331%7C150008182965%7C297751469959%7C&ef_id=CjwKCAiAkp6tBhB5EiwANTCx1G_ek-lL-QZt-HolZn3jRnrEDpHUTqA0dzl22f6i4FEY8mXRXWIrWRoCnu8QAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!2519!3!666661326138!b!!g!!ford%20suv%20lineup&gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>pretty</em> duplicative</a>: Do most consumers understand the difference between a Ford Edge and a Ford Escape? There’s no reason Ford couldn’t add an Escape EV to its lineup — something a little smaller and a little cheaper. That’s exactly what Kia does with the EV Niro, after all.</p><p>It helps, too, that lots of Kia and Hyundai’s cars look like great deals for consumers. Many of their key offerings hover in the high $30,000s to mid $40,000s, seemingly the sweet spot for new family cars today. Even though Hyundai and Kia’s cars <a href="https://heatmap.news/guides/ev-tax-credit-new-2024" target="_self">don’t qualify for the new EV tax credit</a>, Americans can use the $7,500 federal tax credit if they lease a vehicle instead.</p><p>Hyundai especially has used this credit — and a creative mix of <a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/deals-articles/2024-hyundai-ioniq-6-rebate-undercuts-model-3-highland-by-9-000" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">rebates and low-interest-rate offers</a> — to bring down the monthly payment for consumers. (Nearly half of new Ioniq 5s are leased, according to BNEF, which is a much higher rate than normal for Hyundai’s cars.)</p><p>Finally, it helps that Kia and <em>especially </em>Hyundai are making more interesting-looking vehicles than any other automaker right now. Compared to the staid peoplemover that is, say, <a href="https://www.vw.com/en/models/id-4.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Volkswagen ID.4</a>, the Ioniq 5 is striking, novel, and seems to push EV design forward. <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/44928/hyundais-design-strategy-for-ioniq-is-pixelated" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Its pixelated taillights</a> are unlike anything else on the road, and it’s an extremely charismatic vehicle to drive; it’s just a better <em>product, </em>overall, than other cars out there.</p><p>And that might be the most important lesson behind Hyundai and Kia’s success. For the past few decades, decarbonization advocates have gotten used to thinking about electric cars primarily as a market abstraction: Are they cheap? Are they available? Are they growing as a sector? But as the EV transition continues, we are going to have to think about them more as <em>products</em>, as specific tools that can improve someone’s life by their presence. The EV companies that ultimately win will make better products than their competitors — cars that bring together capability, design, and price in a special way. Right now, Hyundai and Kia are pushing to the front of that race.<br/></p>

## The South Is Smashing Electricity Records in the Dead of Winter

date: 2024-01-17, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTEwODExMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0ODUwNDI2Nn0.y-Mf5zPCBe1_NnKhEBFH7sg37IFvTGAUklGDKEN7mjI/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p>America’s largest public power company just set a new record. The Tennessee Valley Authority said consumers used around 34,500 megawatts of electricity on Wednesday morning, about 1,000 megawatts more than its previous all-time record of around 33,500 megawatts in August 2007.</p><p>While the cold weather across much of the country has strained many power grids, especially those in the South where electric heating is more common, it’s noteworthy that TVA not only broke its winter record, but it’s all-time record as well. By contrast, the market that covers 90% of Texas, ERCOT, <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/texas-grid-demand-cold-mornings" target="_blank">set a winter demand record earlier this week</a>, but its overall record is still from this past summer.</p><p>Much of the area around the Tennessee Valley served by the Authority have seen persistent low temperatures over the past few days. Nashville has a forecast high of 30 degrees Wednesday and has gotten as cold as -1 degree Fahrenheit, only the second time the city has experienced below-zero temperatures since 1996,<a href="https://twitter.com/NWSNashville/status/1747576400826318958?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> according to the National Weather Service</a>.<br/><br/>And cold temperatures mean more electricity usage. Like much of the region, Tennesseans <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=TN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">largely heat their homes using electricity</a> as opposed to fuel oil or natural gas.<br/><br/>“Heavy snow and bitter cold temperatures are creating record high demand for electricity across the Southeast region,” the TVA said in a warning released Tuesday, asking its customers to reduce their electricity consumption from 6 am to 10 am. Similar warnings were issued by ERCOT, which also serves millions of households who heat their homes via electricity. The cold snap is<a href="https://www.tva.com/newsroom/articles/cold-snap-arrives" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> expected to last through the weekend</a>.</p><p>And like in Texas, the amount of power TVA is called upon to provide has grown as the region it serves has seen its population and economy grow.</p><p>While TVA has a <a href="https://www.tva.com/energy/our-power-system/renewables" target="_blank">relatively modest solar portfolio</a> compared to the large and growing amounts of wind and solar in Texas, the TVA can still struggle with cold mornings. Some of this is due to what solar power it does have not being available, but it’s largely because of the nature of electricity demand in the winter. On cold days, it is especially chilly in the morning, when people are trying to heat their homes between waking up and going to work or school. By contrast, summer afternoons and early evenings are tough for grids to manage because temperatures stay high even as the sun goes down and people return to their homes and cool them and start operating appliances. <br/></p><p>TVA’s generation mix is almost unique within the United States in that much of it is non-carbon-emitting but with relatively little wind or solar. About 60% of its power comes from carbon-free sources, which are nearly entirely its three nuclear plants and its iconic dams.</p>

## Google introduces Google Takeout API

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

Google has detailed more of the changes it&#8217;s implementing to comply with the European Union&#8217;s Digital Markets Act. We already covered the changes to linked services, but Google is also changing how results related to shopping and booking results are displayed. We will introduce dedicated units that include a group of links to comparison sites from across the web, and query shortcuts at the top of the search page to help people refine their search, including by focusing results just on comparison sites. For categories like hotels, we will also start testing a dedicated space for comparison sites and direct suppliers to show more detailed individual results including images, star ratings and more. These changes will result in the removal of some features from the search page, such as the Google Flights unit. ↫ Oliver Bethell Google is also releasing its promised Google Takeout API, allowing developers to programmatically deal with users wanting to take their data out of Google to another service. This one in particular I&#8217;m interested in, since I&#8217;m curious if, say, a competing email service will make it easier and automatic to move away from Gmail.

## Maine Court Puts Trump Ballot Decision on Hold Until After US Supreme Court Acts

date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA

Washington — A Maine court on Wednesday ordered the state's top election official to reevaluate a decision to bar former President Donald Trump from the Republican primary ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on a related case from Colorado. 


State Superior Court Judge Michaela Murphy found that the Supreme Court's decision to take the Colorado case "changes everything about the order in which these issues should be decided and by which court." 


The judge ordered Maine Secretary of State Shanna Bellows, a Democrat, to reassess her decision to bar Trump from the ballot within 30 days after the Supreme Court rules. 


In December, Bellows determined that Trump, the frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, was ineligible to hold office again under a provision in the U.S. Constitution that bars people who have engaged in insurrection or rebellion from holding office. 


Depending on the sweep of its ruling in the Colorado case, the U.S. Supreme Court could resolve the issue nationwide in the coming weeks, with oral arguments scheduled for February 8. 


Maine and Colorado are so far the only two states to disqualify Trump under the constitutional provision, known as Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Both states have put their decisions on hold while Trump appeals. 


Courts and election officials in several other states have rejected similar ballot challenges to Trump's candidacy.

## US Lawmakers Push for Limits on American Investment in China Tech

date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA

Capitol Hill — U.S. lawmakers renewed calls Wednesday to pass bipartisan legislation that would restrict American investment in Chinese technology.


“It should come as no surprise that China's military and surveillance state are exploiting loopholes in U.S. policy to access billions of U.S. investment dollars and expertise. We know that U.S. investment has not democratized China and countries which are controlled by the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] have no power over the applications of their technology. The CCP can direct it to us for military or surveillance purposes,” House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul said at a hearing on the legislation Wednesday. 


The bill – which has support from both conservative organizations and the Biden administration – was not included in the National Defense Authorization Act or NDAA passed late last year. Republican Senator John Cornyn has sponsored companion legislation in the U.S. Senate that passed with more than ninety votes. 


Lawmakers hope it can still be passed individually and signed into law.  


If passed, McCaul said the measure, H.R. 6349, would target “specific technology sectors, like AI [artificial intelligence] and quantum computing, that are empowering China’s military development and surveillance.” 


Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said an executive order issued by the Biden administration last August “that calls for provisions and notification requirements of specific types of American investments in China, or in certain companies that develop or produce semiconductors, quantum computers, and artificial intelligence applications” is an important first step. 


But experts in U.S.-China relations told a House panel more could be done. 


“Congress has an opportunity to build on the initial steps taken by the Trump and Biden administrations to prevent U.S. capital from fueling China’s military and intelligence capabilities. First, Washington should take a sectoral rather than merely an entity-based approach. The Treasury Department has demonstrated since at least 2021 that it is disinterested in using even its existing narrow authorities to limit investment in Chinese military-linked companies. And in fairness to the Treasury Department tackling the problem on a company-by-company basis would be a resource-intensive and gargantuan task,” Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser during the Trump administration, said Wednesday. 


“We still haven't learned that they will do everything they can to take anything we sell, particularly in the area of electronics and really high tech, and use it for the military. They've been doing that for decades. We don't learn. We think somehow if you trade more, they'll matriculate from dictatorship to democracy,” Republican Rep. Chris Smith said Wednesday.


The bipartisan push in the U.S. House comes as Senate negotiators continue work on the White House’s $106 billion national security supplemental request that includes funding to combat Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific. Citing a border security crisis, Senate Republicans have sought changes to U.S. immigration law in return for their votes to pass more than $50 billion in assistance to Ukraine that is also part of the Biden administration’s request. 


Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged lawmakers Wednesday to reach an agreement soon. 


“It’s become quite fashionable in Washington to talk about how we’re not taking competition with China seriously enough,” McConnell said. “Winning this competition means credibly deterring Beijing’s worst impulses, which, for us, means investing in American strength. Outcompeting the PRC [People's Republic of China] will require greater investments in our military capabilities and in our industrial capacity to produce them. The West cannot be caught unprepared for this challenge. We cannot afford to neglect the lessons of history.”

## The Case for and Against AI Watermarking

date: 2024-01-17, updated: 2024-01-17, from: RAND blog

The hype around the concept of AI-output watermarking may be masking very real system challenges. And failure to address watermarking as a systems problem is likely to result in solutions that risk working against the security and trust they seek to instill.

## The Search for a High Seas Solution

While Western military action against the Houthis has increased, the Red Sea crisis is sailing through opaque waters. Short-term military action might help with the immediate crisis, but shipping routes will remain vulnerable unless the world recognizes its exposure to threats and cooperates to defend them.

## Corporations Are Not To Be Loved

date: 2024-01-17, from: Innessential (Brint Simmons' blog)

<p>I started using Apple computers — and writing code for them, starting with BASIC — 43 years ago, before the Macintosh, even, and I’ve made this my career. I’ve had all these decades to really, thoroughly delight in these incredible machines and software, and to give a little back with my own apps.</p>

<p>Apple’s positive effect on my life should not be underestimated. My Mom once (lovingly, teasingly) said to me that my alternate career, had all this never happened, was “criminal genius.” Which might have been fun too, but possibly more stressful than I might have liked. At any rate, Apple has saved me from a life of crime, and I should love Apple for that.</p>

<p>But I need to remember, now and again, that Apple is a corporation, and corporations aren’t people, and they can’t love you back. You wouldn’t love GE or Exxon or Comcast — and you shouldn’t love Apple. It’s not an exception to the rule: there are no exceptions.</p>

<p>Apple doesn’t care about you personally in the least tiny bit, and if you were in their way somehow, they would do whatever their might — effectively infinite compared to your own — enables them to deal with you.</p>

<p>Luckily, Apple has just provided us all with a reminder. Just like the sixth finger in an AI-rendered hand, Apple’s policies for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">Distributing apps in the U.S. that provide an external purchase link</a> are startlingly graceless and a jarring, but not surprising, reminder that Apple is not a real person and not worthy of your love.</p>

## Getting 'Left-of-Launch' in the Counter-Drone Fight

date: 2024-01-17, updated: 2024-01-17, from: RAND blog

The democratization of drone technology means that adversaries are now able to conduct attacks with near impunity. The Houthis' recent drone attacks in the Red Sea show that America's current approach to countering them is not working. A holistic, offensive strategy is needed.

## Judge Threatens Trump With Expulsion From Defamation Trial

date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK  — A federal judge in New York on Wednesday threatened to expel former U.S. President Donald Trump from a civil trial after he repeatedly made side comments disparaging the testimony of his accuser, writer E. Jean Carroll. 


Carroll is seeking damages from Trump, whom she accuses of defaming her after she accused him of sexually abusing her decades ago. 


Judge Lewis Kaplan told Trump that his right to be at the trial would be revoked if he continued to ignore warnings to keep his comments to his lawyers quieter and out of earshot of the nine-member jury. 


But after an initial warning, Carroll's lawyer said Trump could still be heard making remarks to his lawyers, including "it is a witch hunt" and "it really is a con job." 


Kaplan, after excusing the jury for lunch, said, "Mr. Trump, I hope I don't have to consider excluding you from the trial. I understand you're probably eager for me to do that." 


"I would love it," Trump shot back, shrugging as he sat between lawyers Alina Habba and Michael Madaio at the defense table. 


"I know you would like it. You just can't control yourself in this circumstance, apparently," Kaplan responded. 


"You can't either," Trump muttered. 




The exchange came after Carroll lawyer Shawn Crowley complained for a second time that Trump could be heard "loudly saying things that are false" as he sat at the defense table.


Kaplan said, "I'm just going to ask that Mr. Trump take special care to keep his voice down when conferring with counsel to make sure the jury does not hear it." 


The jury was seated less than 4 meters from where Trump was sitting. 


Trump was particularly incensed that Kaplan refused to call off the proceedings on Thursday so Trump could attend his mother-in-law's funeral in Florida and not miss any of the courtroom testimony. 


Before Carroll resumed her testimony after lunch, Trump's lawyers asked for Kaplan to recuse himself from the case because of "general hostility" toward the former president. 


"Denied," Kaplan said in a one-word response. 


Carroll, now 80, has alleged that Trump decades ago sexually assaulted her in a dressing room at the Bergdorf-Goodman department store and then defamed her by denying the attack occurred and saying that he did not know who she was. Carroll was a long-time advice columnist for Elle magazine at the time of the alleged assault. 




A New York jury last year awarded Carroll $5 million in ruling that Trump sexually abused her and that he defamed Carroll in 2022 comments he made while denying the attack occurred and saying that she was "not my type." 


Carroll testified, "It means I'm too ugly to assault." 


An excerpt of Trump's October 2022 deposition released by U.S. District Court for Southern New York included an exchange wherein Trump mistook a photo of Carroll for his ex-wife, Marla Maples. 


In the current case, Kaplan has ruled that the facts of the alleged attack are already established by the earlier verdict and that the jury's only decision is whether to award further damages, $10 million or more, because of 2019 remarks Trump made about Carroll while he was president. 


As Trump watched from the defense table Wednesday, Carroll told the jurors, "I'm here because Donald Trump assaulted me and when I wrote about it, he said it never happened. He lied and shattered my reputation." 


Once, Carroll testified, she was a respected advice columnist. "Now, I'm known as the liar, the fraud and the whack job." 


Trump has made repeated disparaging comments about Carroll on his Truth Social platform in recent days leading up the trial. 


Carroll testified, "He has continued to lie. He lied last month. He lied on Sunday. He lied yesterday." 


While attending the trial in New York, Trump, the leading Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential campaign, has shuttled back and forth between the courtroom and campaign appearances in the northeastern state of New Hampshire, where the first U.S. party primary election is set for next Tuesday.

## NASA’s Roman to Search for Signs of Dark Matter Clumps

date: 2024-01-17, from: NASA breaking news

Some of the finest, smallest details in the universe – the gaps between elongated groups of stars – may soon help astronomers reveal dark matter in greater detail than ever before. After NASA&#8217;s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope launches, by May 2027, researchers will use its images to explore what exists between looping tendrils of stars that are pulled [&#8230;]

## US Redesignates Yemen's Houthis as Major Terror Group

date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The United States is cracking down on Yemen’s Houthi rebels, redesignating them as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group following weeks of missile and drone attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.


The move came nearly three years after the Houthis were first designated as a terror group and then subsequently delisted because of humanitarian concerns, and it followed repeated demands from the U.S. and other countries for the Houthis to stop firing on commercial shipping.


But the demands have been ignored, and attacks have continued despite a series of airstrikes by the U.S. and Britain, aimed at taking out radar systems and launch sites used in the attacks.




“We cannot sit idly by and watch what the Houthis are doing in the Red Sea and not recognize their actions for what they are,” a senior U.S. administration official told reporters, briefing the condition of anonymity ahead of the official announcement.


“These attacks fit the textbook definition of terrorism,” a second official said, likewise speaking on the condition of anonymity. “They have endangered U.S. personnel, civilian mariners and our partners, jeopardized global trade and threatened freedom of navigation.”


U.S. officials point to about 30 attacks from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen since mid-November, impacting citizens, cargo and vessels from more than 50 countries.


Officials have also said that since the attacks started, some 2,000 ships have been diverted thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea. Additionally, Houthi militants have threatened or taken hostage mariners from more than 20 countries.


On Tuesday, the U.S. for the first time carried out a series of preemptive strikes, destroying four Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles before they could be launched.




That followed two waves of U.S. and British strikes last week against more than 60 targets in 16 locations across Houthi-controlled Yemen.




Houthi officials Wednesday described the U.S. designation as an attempt at “blackmail.”


“Whoever fails with aggression will certainly fail with a decision [of designation],” Houthi media official Abdul-Rahman Al-Ahnumi said in an interview with Reuters.


"The decision came at this time after Britain and America launched a military aggression against Yemen and failed to achieve the same goal, which is to dissuade Yemen from its position,” Al-Ahnumi said. “It is also an attempt to dissuade Yemen from its position supporting Palestine and Gaza.”


But in separate statements Wednesday, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Houthi attacks “unprecedented.”


“This designation is an important tool to impede terrorist funding to the Houthis, further restrict their access to financial markets,” Sullivan said.


“The Houthis must be held accountable for their actions,” Blinken said.


Several U.S. officials, though, left open the possibility the designation could be revoked if the attacks cease.




“The ultimate goal of sanctions is to convince the Houthis to de-escalate and bring about a positive change in behavior,” one of the senior administration officials who briefed on the condition of anonymity told reporters. “If the Houthis cease their attacks, we can consider delisting designation.”


But the official added the U.S. is taking steps to ensure that the designation does not harm efforts to help Yemen’s civilian population, where the United Nations estimates 24 million people are at risk of starvation.


The re-designation of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group will not go into effect for 30 days, “to allow us to ensure robust humanitarian carve-outs are in place,” the official said.


The official also said commercial shipments to Yemen of for food, medicine and fuel would not be affected by the sanctions.


The designation, however, will block the ability of the Houthis to access the U.S. financial system and paves the way for other sanctions and law enforcement actions against the group.


U.S. officials said the ability to ensure to continuation of humanitarian aid played a role in the decision to label the Houthis with the SDGT designation.


They said designating the Houthis with the harsher Foreign Terrorist Organization, or FTO, label would require additional sanctions that could ensnare aid organizations trying to provide relief for Yemen’s civilians.


“We found in our conversations with groups that are providing humanitarian aid in Yemen that an FTO designation ran the risk of having a deterrent effect on some of those aid groups continuing to provide aid, worried that they might be charged as providing material support to a terrorist organization,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters during a briefing on Wednesday.


“So, when weighing those options, we decided that the SDGT designation gave us the tools to deny the Houthis access to the financial system, and gave us the tools to impose additional actions, additional sanctions, on anyone who does business with the Houthis, while minimizing some of the downstream harm to Yemeni civilians,” he said.


Some aid groups, though, have already raised concerns that the SDGT designation will hurt more than it helps.


“Even with carve-outs, there is likely to be a serious chilling effect,” the International Rescue Committee’s Anastasia Moran said in a statement. “We are concerned some private sector actors, including food importers and banks facilitating transactions for humanitarian organizations, may choose to disengage altogether.”


In contrast, some U.S. lawmakers are warning the SDGT designation does not go far enough.


“Designating the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist only applies sanctions and avoids taking any real action,” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner said in a statement. “It’s time to lead and protect and call them what they are — a Foreign Terrorist Organization.”


Elisabeth Kendall, a Yemen specialist at the University of Cambridge in Britain, cautioned that regardless of the type of terrorist designation, the impact on the Houthis was likely to be minimal.


“Houthi hardliners and leaders will see this as a badge of honor and continue business as usual,” she told VOA via email.


“They will not be the ones to suffer,” she added. “The war economy is booming and has enriched many powerful figures. The smuggling trade may even prove more lucrative following the designation.”


There are also questions about how the new designation will affect countries like Iran that have been supplying the Houthis.


“They [Houthis] currently use IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] funding, training and weapons to destabilize Yemen and engage in terrorist activities or terrorism that affects the region,” said a third senior administration official in response to a question from VOA.


“So, we will continue to also counter Iranian malign influence wherever we can,” the official said. “Of course, the choice to move away from Iran is now in the hands of the Houthis."


The U.S. first designated the Houthis, also known as Ansarallah, as both an SDGT and a FTO during the last days of President Donald Trump’s administration in January 2021.




According to a statement by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the move was intended “to hold Ansarallah accountable for its terrorist acts, including cross-border attacks threatening civilian populations, infrastructure and commercial shipping.”


But the designation was revoked about a month later under current U.S. President Joe Biden, with officials citing the need to get humanitarian aid into Yemen to prevent a possible famine.


“This decision is a recognition of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said at the time. “By focusing on alleviating the humanitarian situation in Yemen, we hope the Yemeni parties can also focus on engaging in dialogue.”


The White House on Wednesday defended its decision to remove the terror designation for the Houthis, despite the need to redesignate them now.


“A big reason why we delisted them literally on day one was to address a dire, dire humanitarian situation on the ground," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.


The Pentagon on Wednesday said the decision to designate the Houthis would not affect military operations in the region.


White House Bureau Chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report. Some information came from Reuters and The Associated Press.

## Webb Shows Many Early Galaxies Looked Like Pool Noodles, Surfboards

date: 2024-01-17, from: NASA breaking news

Researchers analyzing images from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope have found that galaxies in the early universe are often flat and elongated, like surfboards and pool noodles – and are rarely round, like volleyballs or frisbees. “Roughly 50 to 80% of the galaxies we studied appear to be flattened in two dimensions,” explained lead author [&#8230;]

ChatGPT is like having a programming partner you can try ideas out on, or ask for alternative approaches, and they're always there, and not too busy to help out. They know everything you don't know and need to know, and rarely hallucinate (you have to check the work, same as with a human btw). It's remarkable how much it is like having an ideal human programming partner. It's the kind of helper I aspire to be.

## Pluralistic: The super-rich got that way through monopolies (17 Jan 2024)

date: 2024-01-17, from: Cory Doctorow's blog

Today's links The super-rich got that way through monopolies: A report in honor of Davos. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. This day in history: 2009, 2014, 2019, 2023 Colophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading The super-rich got that way through monopolies (permalink) Just in time for Davos, here's 'Taken, not earned: How monopolists drive the world’s power and wealth divide," a report from a coalition of international tax justice and anti-corporate activist groups: https://www.balancedeconomy.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Davos-Taken-not-Earned-full-Report-2024-FINAL.pdf Everyone &#8211; even the World Economic Forum &#8211; says that wealth inequality is a serious problem, corroding our politics and our social cohesion. What this report does is link that inequality to monopolies, which produce the billionaires who are wrecking the world. The rise of monopolies over the past 40 years came about as the result of specific, deliberate policy choices. As the report documents, the wealthiest people in America funneled a fortune into neutering antitrust enforcement, through the "consumer welfare" doctrine. This is an economic theory that equates monopolies with efficiency: "If everyone is buying the same things from the same store, that tells you the store is doing something right, not something criminal." 40 years ago, and ever since, the wealthy have funded think-tanks, university programs and even "continuing education" programs for federal judges to push this line: https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/13/post-bork-era/#manne-down They didn't do this for ideological reasons &#8211; they were chasing material goals. Monopolies produce vast profits, and those profits produce vast wealth. The rise and rise of the super rich cannot be decoupled from the rise and rise of monopolies. If you're new to this, you might think that "monopoly" only refers to a sector in which there is only one seller. But that's not what economists mean when they talk about monopolies and monopolization: for them, a monopoly is a company with power. Economists who talk about monopolies mean companies that "can act independently without needing to consider the responses of competitors, customers, workers, or even governments." One way to measure that power is through markups ("the difference between the selling price of goods or services and their cost"). Very large companies in concentrated industries have very high markups, and they're getting higher. From 2017-22, the 20 largest companies in the world had average markups of 50%. The 100 largest companies average 43%. The smallest half of companies get average markups of 25%. Those markups rose steeply during the covid lockdowns &#8211; and so did the wealth of the billionaires who own them. Tech billionaires &#8211; Bezos, Brin and Page, Gates and Ballmer &#8211; all made their fortunes from monopolies. Warren Buffet is a proud monopolist who says "the single most important decision in evaluating a business is pricing power… if you have to have a prayer session before raising the price by 10 percent, then you’ve got a terrible business." We are living in the age of the monopoly. In the 1930s, the top 0.1% of US companies accounted for less than half of America's GDP. Today, it's 90%. And it's accelerating, with global mergers climbing from 2,676 in 1985 to 62,000 in 2021. Monopoly's cheerleaders claim that these numbers vindicate them. Monopolies are so efficient that everyone wants to create them. Those efficiencies can be seen in the markups monopolies can charge, and the profits they can make. If a monopoly has a 50% markup, that's just the "efficiency of scale." But what is the actual shape of this "efficiency?" How is it manifest? The report's authors answer this with one word: power. Monopolists have the power "to extract wealth from, to restrict the freedoms of, and to manipulate or steer the vastly larger numbers of losers." They establish themselves as gatekeepers and create chokepoints that they can use to raise prices paid by their customers and lower the payout to their suppliers: https://chokepointcapitalism.com/ These chokepoints let monopolies usurp "one of the ultimate prerogatives of state power: taxation." Amazon sellers pay a 51% tax to sell on the platform. App Store suppliers pay a 30% tax on every dollar they make with their apps. That translates into higher costs. Consider a good that costs $10 to make: the bottom 50% of companies (by size) would charge $12.50 for that product on average. The largest companies would charge $15. Thus monopolies don't just make their owners richer &#8211; they make everyone else poorer, too. This power to set prices is behind the greedflation (or, more politely, "seller's inflation"). The CEOs of the largest companies in the world keep getting on investor calls and bragging about this: https://pluralistic.net/2023/03/11/price-over-volume/#pepsi-pricing-power The food system is incredibly monopolistic. The Cargill family own the largest commodity trader in the world, which is how they built up a family fortune worth $43b. Cargill is one of the "ABCD" companies ("Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus") that control the world's food supply, and they tripled their profits during the lockdown. Monopolies gouge everyone &#8211; even governments. Pfizer charged the NHS £18-22/shot for vaccines that cost £5/shot to make. They took the British government for £2bn &#8211; that's enough to pay last year's pay hike for NHS nurses, six times over, But monopolies also abuse their suppliers, especially their employees. All over the world, competition authorities are uncovering "wage fixing" and "no poaching" agreements among large firms, who collude to put a cap on what workers in their sector can earn. Unions report workers having their pay determined by algorithms. Bosses lock employees in with noncompetes and huge repayment bills for "training": https://pluralistic.net/2022/08/04/its-a-trap/#a-little-on-the-nose Monopolies corrupt our governments. Companies with huge markups can spend some of that money on lobbying. The 20 largest companies in the world spend more than €155m/year lobbying in the US and alone, not counting the money they spend on industry associations and other cutouts that lobby on their behalf. Big Tech leads the pack on lobbying, accounting for 82% of EU lobbying spending and 58% of US lobbying. One key monopoly lobbying priority is blocking climate action, from Apple lobbying against right-to-repair, which creates vast mountains of e-waste, to energy monopolist lobbying against renewables. And energy companies are getting more monopolistic, with Exxonmobil spending $65b to buy Pioneer and Chevron spending $60b to buy Hess. Many of the world's richest people are fossil fuel monopolists, like Charles and Julia Koch, the 18th and 19th richest people on the Forbes list. They spend fortunes on climate denial. When people talk about the climate impact of billionaires, they tend to focus on the carbon footprints of their mansions and private jets, but the true environmental cost of the ultra rich comes from the anti-renewables, pro-emissions lobbying they buy with their monopoly winnings. The good news is that the tide is turning on monopolies. A coalition of "businesses, workers, farmers, consumers and other civil society groups" have created a "remarkably successful anti-monopoly movement." The past three years saw more regulatory action on corporate mergers, price-gouging, predatory pricing, labor abuses and other evils of monopoly than we got in the past 40 years. The business press &#8211; cheerleaders for monopoly &#8211; keep running editorials claiming that enforcers like Lina Khan are getting nothing done. Sure, WSJ, Khan's getting nothing done &#8211; that's why you ran 80 editorial about her: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/14/making-good-trouble/#the-peoples-champion (Khan's winning like crazy. Just last month she killed four megamergers:) https://www.thesling.org/the-ftc-just-blocked-four-mergers-in-a-month-heres-how-its-latest-win-fits-into-the-broader-campaign-to-revive-antitrust/ The EU and UK are taking actions that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago. Canada is finally set to get a real competition law, with the Trudeau government promising to add an "abuse of dominance" rule to Canada's antitrust system. Even more exciting are the moves in the global south. In South Africa, "competition law contains some of the most progressive ideas of all": It actively seeks to create greater economic participation, particularly for ‘historically disadvantaged persons’ as part of its public interest considerations in merger decisions. Balzac wrote, "Behind every great fortune there is a crime." Chances are, the rapsheet includes an antitrust violation. Getting rid of monopolies won't get rid of all the billionaires, but it'll certainly get rid of a hell of a lot of them.

## How Climate Denial Is Changing

date: 2024-01-17, from: Heatmap News

<em><strong>Current conditions: </strong>Nashville recorded sub-zero temperatures for only the second time since 1996 • Heavy rains left at least 11 dead in Rio de Janeiro • Invasive and deadly fire ants have been spotted “rafting” on Australian flood waters.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Climate denial tactics are changing </h3><p>
<strong></strong>The climate denial movement has entered a new phase, suggests new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=808b5ce620&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">research</a> from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The study analyzed transcripts of more than 12,000 climate-related YouTube videos posted since 2018 and found evidence that “old denial” narratives (Global warming isn’t real! Humans have nothing to do with it!) are becoming less common as the effects of climate change become undeniable. But they’re being replaced by what the researchers call “new denial” tactics. These narratives focus on discrediting climate solutions like renewable energy projects and electric vehicles, or downplaying the harmful effects of global warming. “New denial” claims more than tripled since 2018; “old denial” claims were down by one-third.

</p><p>
	The shift exposes a gap in YouTube’s disinformation policies: While the platform has cracked down on advertising on videos that deny outright that climate change is real, no such rules exist for the wave of “new denial.” The study estimates YouTube could be making up to $13.4 million per year in ad revenue from channels that promote denial. “Given that the battleground has shifted and the new denial is the biggest component of climate denial content overall, it’s time for them to extend their rules to that as well,” Imran Ahmed, founder and chief executive officer of the CCDH, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=1ecffa3675&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">told</a> <em>Bloomberg Green.</em>
</p><h3>2. Shipping emissions on the rise due to Red Sea conflict </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Greenhouse gas emissions from the shipping sector are increasing due to ongoing disruption in the Red Sea, <em>Reuters</em> <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=8f7b9f60eb&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reports</a>. The Red Sea is the gateway to the Suez Canal, which offers a quick route for ships transporting goods from Asia to Europe. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have been attacking ships in the region in response to the Israel-Hamas war. To avoid the conflict, vessels are taking longer routes via the southern tip of Africa and burning more fuel as a result. The average container vessel transporting goods from China to Rotterdam via the Suez Canal would spew about 41,000 tons of carbon dioxide, but that total jumps to 55,000 tons if that ship has to go the long way, <em>Reuters</em> says. And as ships increase their speeds to make up for lost time, they produce even more pollution. International shipping already accounts for about 2% of global energy-related CO2, <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=a1df136a28&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to</a> the International Energy Agency.</p><div class="horizontal-rule"></div><p>

<strong></strong>Southeast Asia has increased its solar- and wind-power capacity by 20% in the last year, according to a new <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=9ef39586d3&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">report</a> from Global Energy Monitor (GEM). The analysis looks at the energy mix across 10 countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). These include Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Cambodia. It finds that solar and wind account for 9% of electricity generating capacity in the region, and flags Vietnam as being a regional leader. When combined with hydropower, geothermal, and bioenergy, this brings the ASEAN bloc’s renewable capacity to 32%, which is very near its goal of 35% by 2025. GEM says this target is therefore “unambitious.” The report cautions that fossil fuel use is likely to rise in the region as “energy demands are outpacing utility-scale solar and wind development.”
</p><h3>4. Mountain goats are becoming more nocturnal </h3><p>
<strong></strong>Mountain goats are daytime creatures, and they usually do most of their foraging while the sun is up. But as global temperatures rise, they are becoming more active at night, according to a new study <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=6229b55e17&e=9a8faf5b79" target="_blank">seen by<em> The Guardian</em></a>. Researchers from the University of Sassari, in Sardinia, tracked the behaviors of the Alpine ibex goat over 13 years and found that on especially warm days, the animals were more likely to be active at night, even though this put them at higher risk of being attacked by predators. “We can expect that during the night when the temperature is lower other animals will shift their activity towards the nocturnal hours,” <a href="https://news.us13.list-manage.com/track/click?u=eacecbac4b1d10158b5b6fbad&id=e341c95f78&e=9a8faf5b79" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Francesca Brivio</a>, who co-authored the study, tells <em>The Guardian</em>. “If during the day it is too hot to eat or to be active, they will prefer to perform all their activities, like foraging, at night.”

## The FAFSA Rollout Has Been Rough On Students. The Biggest Problem Is Yet To Come

date: 2024-01-17, updated: 2024-01-17, from: The LAist

The Education Department has made a big mistake with this year's FAFSA — one that could cost students financial aid they're entitled to. It's now grappling with how to implement a fix.

## Bank fees, Apple fees and shipping fees

date: 2024-01-17, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>Many of the nation&#8217;s largest banks have reported mixed results recently. Banks often turn to fees – including overdraft charges – to help boost their bottom lines. But a Biden administration rule announced Wednesday would reduce those fees and save consumers billions a year. Then, Apple is making changes to its App Store but will still charge a hefty commission. And shipping rates have soared following continued Red Sea attacks.</p>

## Code Written with AI Assistants Is Less Secure

date: 2024-01-17, updated: 2024-01-05, from: Bruce Schneier blog

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622">Do Users Write More Insecure Code with AI Assistants?</a>&#8220;:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI&#8217;s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants&#8217; language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</p></blockquote>

## Toyota Is Far Less Climate-Friendly Than Most Americans Think

date: 2024-01-17, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MDcyOTA0My9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMTMxNzk2NX0.Prii2t15LJ-e9kjw_QiHWEewSrNKuWHU2N7o3ZYYmls/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">A year ago, the Toyota Prius went from bulbous to badass. The hybrid icon got its most dramatic redesign in two decades, which dispensed with the familiar friendly and rounded look for an angular, almost menacing front end. The vehicle, which once again came in traditional hybrid and plug-in hybrid variants, earned enthusiasm from buyers and <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-prius-hybrid-2024-car-of-the-year/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">plaudits</a> from the auto press. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23462123/2023-toyota-prius-glow-up-redesign-still-hybrid-not-ev" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">What Toyota didn’t do</a>, curiously, was finally turn the Prius into a true battery electric vehicle. </p><p>The world’s largest car company has been among the slowest of the major automakers to embrace 100% electric propulsion. Yet, as Heatmap data shows, such heel-dragging hasn’t dinged Toyota’s green reputation. In our <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/change-polling-concern-belief-republicans-vs-democrats" target="_blank">November 2023 survey</a>, Toyota scored the second-highest on perceived sustainability of any automaker.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image">
<img alt="" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="b6d39dfd7e41c38bbf843f90a6d50ce4" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" id="6c03d" loading="lazy" src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MTEwMTQ1NS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzc4ODYxNX0.UX29xDtDMjJ2TnBlz5ARb8m_qQWjnDD0f2Cvhi-9Yu0/image.png?width=980"/>
</p><p>Audi’s E-Tron, VW’s ID.4, Kia’s Soul EV, BMW’s i3, and Hyundai’s Kona Electric were all on sale in the U.S. well before the <a href="https://www.toyota.com/bz4x/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bZ4X</a>, Toyota’s first mass market EV. Yet none of those cars could transform American attitudes about companies that made them. While Tesla’s notoriety helped it to top our sustainability survey, the likes of Audi, Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai, and BMW all scored below Toyota.</p><p>To be clear, Toyota certainly earned some sustainable bona fides. The Prius for years was the icon of conspicuous conscientious driving. Eventually, the car of the eco-minded became the car of anybody who wanted to get great gas mileage. In selling <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a46274770/hybrid-history-toyota-prius-porsche/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">six million Priuses</a>, Toyota helped countless drivers post far better mpg than they otherwise would have. And let us not forget the Toyota Mirai, which since 2014 has been the best mainstream option for anybody who wants to drive a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle.</p><p>But the results go to show that even at the dawn of the mainstream EV era, more goes into the popular idea of “sustainability” than purely electric cars. </p><p>Volkswagen, for example, may have introduced a popular EV with the ID.4 crossover, but many respondents surely remember the <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15339250/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-vw-diesel-emissions-scandal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">scandal</a> over VW’s diesel emissions and punished the German giant for its misdeeds.</p><p>Or consider the case of Subaru, which was not part of this survey. The brand incessantly advertises itself as a friend of the National Park System and touts its corporate donations to climate causes. Its car show launch events and television commercials depict Subarus in outdoor environments. Given its public image, I’d have to guess that Subaru would have scored highly. Yet none of its vehicles get particularly high gas mileage. (There is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=214106706339905" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Subaru commercial</a> that drives my wife and me crazy, in which a teacher describes her 240-mile daily carbon-spewing commute like it’s a badge of honor.) Like Toyota, Subaru was slow into the EV market; its first, the Solterra, just came out last year. It was co-developed with Toyota and is fundamentally the same car as the bZ4X.</p><p>Despite leading the charge on hybrids and hydrogen, Toyota’s electric enthusiasm has been tepid at best. Whereas many auto giants have trotted out new electrics or teased battery-powered versions of their iconic gas vehicles, Toyota’s attitude more mirrored the general public’s: <em>We’ll just wait until the charging infrastructure makes this more practical for daily driving, thank you very much. </em>In the meantime, the brand touts its “electrified” lineup, which, aside from the bZ4X, is made up entirely of hybrids that also burn gasoline.</p><p>And to drive the point home, Toyota has also actively <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">worked against</a> emissions regulations, repeatedly <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/articles/2022/08/toyotas-green-image-isnt-what-you-think-for-one-where-are-electric-vehicles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lobbying</a> against such efforts. In 2021, the company <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/toyota-motor-company-pay-180-million-settlement-decade-long-noncompliance-clean-air-act" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">settled</a> with the U.S. government for $180 million for failing to comply with Clean Air Act regulations. Hino, a truck- and bus-making division of Toyota, was caught falsifying engine emissions data going back decades.</p><p>Seeing the lukewarm reception given many legacy carmakers’ EV offerings, it’s hard to blame Toyota for languishing in the rear, content to keep selling fossil-fuel burning vehicles for as long as it’s profitable. It also must answer a tricky question: What is the EV Prius? The hybrid standard-bearer had a clear identity as an eggshell that delivered top gas mileage. In the EV space, where even big vehicles deliver excellent mileage equivalence, it’s unclear what the Prius brand name will mean.</p><p>But pretty soon, Toyota needs to pounce. The company is clearly getting a little closer to ready: A couple of months ago I came to praise the <a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/toyota-hilux-revo-ev-tacoma-america" target="_self">Hilux EV</a>, a prototype fully electric version of Toyota’s global best-selling compact truck. That project was a one-off built by engineers overseas, but it points the way to how Toyota could flex its global muscles to help turn the world fleet over to EVs. Toyota is also seen as among the most reliable carmakers — for example, Toyota and its sub-brand Lexus topped the 2023 <em>Consumer Reports</em> <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-reliability-owner-satisfaction/who-makes-the-most-reliable-cars-a7824554938/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reliability rankings.</a> That, combined with its reputation for sustainability, could be enough to convince hesitant car shoppers to go fully electric once the brand finally rolls out EV editions of the Camry, RAV4, or, yes, the Prius.</p><p>The bZ4X might have been <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/toyota/bz4x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uninspiring</a>, but that’s not what really matters. What matters is that Toyota is finally moving into true EVs — and soon, we hope, it will do a lot more to back up its good name among climate-friendly companies.</p><p><em>The Heatmap Climate Poll of 1,000 American adults was conducted by Benenson Strategy Group via online panels from Nov. 6 to 13, 2023. The survey included interviews with Americans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.</em></p>

## Rob Kerchner | Who’s the Fascist?

A hundred years later the same ilk are busily touting a “scientific consensus” [&#8230;]</p>

date: 2024-01-17, from: Heather Cox Richardson blog

[Warning: paragraphs 6&#8211;8 talk about rape.] In yesterday&#8217;s Iowa caucus, 51% of Republican caucusgoers chose former president Donald Trump as their preferred candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Twenty-one percent of Republican caucusgoers chose Florida governor Ron DeSantis. Nineteen percent chose former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. Seven percent chose technology entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. These results mean that 20 of Iowa&#8217;s 40 delegates will go to Trump; 8 to DeSantis; 7 to Haley; and three to Ramaswamy. An apparent Trump surrogate in the primary debates, Ramaswamy suspended his campaign after the caucus and endorsed Trump.

## Trump Back in Court for Second Defamation Trial After Iowa Victory

date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Fresh off a campaign victory in Iowa, Donald Trump sat in a New York courtroom on Tuesday to defend himself for a second time against charges that he defamed writer E. Jean Carroll after she accused him of raping her decades ago.


Trump watched from the defendant's table as Carroll's lawyer told a jury that the then-U.S. president made her life miserable when she went public in 2019 with her story that he had attacked her in a department store dressing room in Manhattan.


"He used the world's biggest microphone to attack Ms. Carroll, to humiliate her, and to destroy her reputation," lawyer Shawn Crowley said.


Carroll, 80, is seeking at least $10 million in damages in a civil case that will put the allegations of sexual assault back in the headlines while Trump pursues the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.


Jurors will only consider how much Trump should pay Carroll in damages, not whether the alleged assault took place or whether Trump lied about it afterward.


Crowley said Trump's "horrible" lies unleashed a torrent of abuse from his followers and wrecked her sense of safety.


"As he's campaigning for president of the United States, Donald Trump continues to lie about Ms. Carroll," Crowley said.


Trump's lawyer Alina Habba countered that Carroll was "basking in the limelight" in the years since she released her memoir and accused Trump of rape.


"She is looking for you to give her a windfall because some people on social media said mean things about her," Habba said.


Trump, 77, has said he wants to testify.


U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan has barred him from arguing that he did not defame or sexually assault Carroll or that she made up her account.


Nevertheless, Trump accused Carroll on social media of lying as court proceedings got underway on Tuesday morning.


Shortly after the court adjourned for the day, Trump accused Kaplan of being politically biased against him, echoing complaints he has made against judges overseeing his other cases.


Trump could spend much of this year shuttling between campaign rallies and courtrooms, as he seeks to win the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.


He won the first state contest in Iowa on Monday by a wide margin, and opinion polls show him leading in the next contest in New Hampshire a week from Tuesday.


"I should be in New Hampshire, campaigning and fighting for our Country, and I will be later today, but for now I had to spend time in a Federal Courthouse with a Trump Hating, Radical Left Judge," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform after the court adjourned for the day.


Trump has pleaded not guilty in four criminal cases that could potentially land him in prison before the November presidential election, including two that accuse him of trying to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. He also is a defendant in at least two other civil cases.


Kaplan said he expects the trial to last three to five days.


Second trial


Trump's high profile was apparent as prospective jurors were screened for the case. Many acknowledged they were familiar with Trump's various legal troubles, though none said they knew the details of the first defamation trial.


One said she used to work for his daughter Ivanka. She was not chosen for the jury.


Jurors' identities are being kept confidential.


Trump has already lost one defamation case against Carroll.


A jury last May ordered Trump to pay the former Elle magazine columnist $5 million for having sexually abused her during the encounter and defaming her in 2022 by denying that it happened. Trump skipped that trial.


Trump is appealing the $5 million award and could appeal any award at the second trial. Appeals could take years.


In both cases, Trump has said he did not know Carroll and that she invented their encounter to sell her memoir.


Kaplan has barred Trump from suggesting he did not rape Carroll, as New York's penal law defines the term, because the first jury did not find that Trump committed rape. Kaplan has ruled that Carroll's rape claim was "substantially true."


Trump also cannot discuss DNA evidence or Carroll's sexual activities or suggest that Democrats are bankrolling her case.


As at the first trial, jurors will be able to see the 2005 "Access Hollywood" video where Trump graphically described the ability of famous people like himself to have sexual relations with beautiful women.


Kaplan has said the video could offer "useful insight into Mr. Trump's state of mind" toward Carroll.


On social media, Trump accused Kaplan of being "biased," echoing attacks he has made on judges overseeing some of his other cases.

## US to Relist Yemen's Houthis as Specially Designated Global Terrorists, AP Sources Say

date: 2024-01-17, from: VOA News USA

WASHINGTON — The Biden administration is expected to soon announce plans to redesignate Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen as specially designated global terrorists, according to two people familiar with the White House decision and a U.S. official.


The move comes as the Houthis have launched dozens of attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The group says it has attacked the ships in response to Israel's military operations in Gaza in the aftermath of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.


The three people familiar with the decision were not authorized to comment and requested anonymity to discuss the matter ahead of the expected formal announcement.


Secretary of State Antony Blinken delisted the Houthis as both a foreign terrorist organization and as specially designated global terrorists in February 2021 as the administration sought to make it easier to get food imports and humanitarian aid into Yemen.


In its waning days, the Trump administration designated the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization over the strong objections of human rights and humanitarian aid groups.


The foreign terrorist designation barred Americans and people and organizations subject to U.S. jurisdiction from providing "material support" to the Houthis, which the groups said would result in an even greater humanitarian catastrophe than what was already happening in Yemen.


Shortly after the Biden administration took office, Blinken removed the designations in a step that was roundly criticized by conservative lawmakers and others but was intended to keep much-needed food, medicine and other aid flowing to Yemen.


Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula bordering the Red Sea, is the poorest country in the Arab world. War and chronic misgovernment have left 24 million Yemenis at risk of hunger and disease as of 2023, and roughly 14 million in acute need of assistance, the United Nations says. About two-thirds of Yemenis live in territory controlled by the Houthis.


While supporters of broad sanctions argue it's possible to shape any enforcement mechanisms to exempt food and humanitarian aid, aid organizations worry that fears of running afoul of U.S. regulation could scare away shippers, banks and other players vital to Yemen's commercial food supply. Arid Yemen imports 90% of its food.


"This designation would add another level of uncertainty and threat for Yemenis still caught in one of the world's largest humanitarian crises," said Scott Paul, an associate director of Oxfam America. "The Biden administration is playing with fire, and we call on them to avoid this designation immediately and prioritize the lives of Yemenis now."


The specially designated global terrorists label to be reimposed on the Houthis does not include sanctions for providing "material support," and it does not come with travel bans that are also imposed with the foreign terrorist organization label, steps intended to help prevent the U.S. move from harming ordinary Yemenis.


Meanwhile, a senior White House official said Tuesday that addressing the ongoing threat by Yemen's Houthi rebels on commercial vessels in the Red Sea is an "all hands on deck" problem that the U.S. and allies must address together to minimize impact on the global economy.


"How long this goes on and how bad it gets comes down not just to the decisions of the countries in the coalition that took strikes last week," White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said during an appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.


The Iran-backed Houthi group has launched dozens of attacks since November on vessels in the Red Sea, a vital corridor for the world's shipping traffic, in what they say is an effort to support Palestinians in the war with Israel. U.S. and British forces have responded by carrying out dozens of air and sea strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen since Friday. The attacks by the Houthis have continued.


Linda Thomas Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said last week that 2,000 ships since November have been forced to divert thousands of miles to avoid the Red Sea. Houthi militants have threatened or taken hostage mariners from more than 20 countries.


The Red Sea attacks have already caused significant disruptions to global trade. Oil prices have edged higher in recent days, though Brent crude futures were down slightly in early trading Tuesday.


The U.S. launched a new strike against the Houthis on Tuesday, hitting anti-ship missiles in the third assault on the Iranian-backed group in recent days. The strike came as the Iranian-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile attack against the Malta-flagged bulk carrier Zografia in the Red Sea. No one was injured.


Sullivan said it was critical that countries with influence on Tehran and other Middle East capitals make it clear "that the entire world rejects wholesale the idea that a group like the Houthis can basically hijack the world."


President Joe Biden's senior adviser acknowledged that the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea as well as groups allied with Iran carrying out attacks in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen pose concerns that the Israel-Hamas war could escalate even as Israeli officials have indicated a shift in intensity in their military campaign.


"We have to guard against and be vigilant against the possibility that in fact, rather than heading towards de-escalation, we are on a path of escalation that we have to manage," Sullivan said.


The comments from Sullivan came after Qatar's prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said during an appearance at the Davos forum that the situation in the Middle East is a "recipe for escalation everywhere." He said Qatar believes that ending the conflict in Gaza will stop the Houthis and militant groups from launching attacks elsewhere in the region.


Sullivan on Tuesday met with Al Thani as well as Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani and Iraqi Kurdish Prime Minister Masrour Barzani, according to the White House.


Iran fired missiles late Monday at what it said were Israeli "spy headquarters" in an upscale neighborhood near the sprawling U.S. Consulate compound in Irbil, the seat of Iraq's northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region, and at targets linked to the extremist Islamic State group in northern Syria.


Iraq on Tuesday called the attacks, which killed several civilians, a "blatant violation" of Iraq's sovereignty and recalled its ambassador from Tehran.

## Update: The Family Who Died at Eagle Pass

date: 2024-01-17, from: Dan Rather's Steady

Often lost in the gamesmanship of border politics are details of those who tragically die trying to get to this country. In 2022, the most recent year for which records are available, nearly 700 people perished or disappeared trying to come to the United States. The International Organization for Migration says this is the deadliest land route for migrants worldwide.

## 86-DOS revisited

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

Recently, the oldest known versions of DOS were uploaded to the internet, and Michal Necasek dove into the floppy images. Even after more than 40 years(!), old software releases and pre-releases can still surface. In the case of 86-DOS 0.11 and 0.34 it’s practically a miracle, since there were probably never very many copies in existence. For the first time since the early 1980s, FAT formatted floppies with the primordial 16-byte directory entry format have come to light. The old 16-byte directory entries were gone by 86-DOS 1.0 in April 1981 and of course never appeared in any public PC DOS release. These prehistoric versions of 86-DOS allow us to fill in further missing pieces in the puzzle of DOS origins. It is fascinating to follow how DOS developed from almost nothing to a multi-million dollar business in the course of just a few years. ↫ Michal Necasek It started out so humbly. Yet, here we are, in 2024, and variants of DOS still have their uses in certain niches. An incredible legacy, for sure.

## A shocking amount of the web is machine translated: insights from multi-way parallelism

date: 2024-01-17, from: OS News

We show that content on the web is often translated into many languages, and the low quality of these multi-way translations indicates they were likely created using Machine Translation (MT). Multi-way parallel, machine generated content not only dominates the translations in lower resource languages; it also constitutes a large fraction of the total web content in those languages. We also find evidence of a selection bias in the type of content which is translated into many languages, consistent with low quality English content being translated en masse into many lower resource languages, via MT. Our work raises serious concerns about training models such as multilingual large language models on both monolingual and bilingual data scraped from the web. ↫ Brian Thompson, Mehak Preet Dhaliwal, Peter Frisch, Tobias Domhan, Marcello Federico As a translator myself, this is entirely unsurprising. Translating is a craft, a skill, and much like with any other craft, you get what you pay for. If you pay your translator(s) a good rate, you get a good translation. If you pay your translator(s) a shit rate, you get a shit translation. If you pay nothing, you get nothing. I&#8217;m definitely seeing more and more people in my industry integrate machine translations, but so far, it&#8217;s not been an actual issue &#8211; I have no qualms about accepting a job where I take a machine-translated text and whip it into shape and turn it into a human-readable, quality translation&#8230; As long as people pay me a reasonable rate for it. Working from a machine translation is often quicker and easier, so the going rate obviously reflects that. The quality of machine translations is absolutely atrocious, however, and the idea of relying on it for texts other people &#8211; customers, clients, employees, etc. &#8211; are actually supposed to read and work from is terrifying. Google Translate is an effective tool for personal use, but throwing, I don&#8217;t know, your product&#8217;s manual at it and dumping the unedited result onto your customers is borderline criminal. Pay nothing, get nothing.
