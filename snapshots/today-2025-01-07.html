The Asus ROG Flow Z13 is a 2-in-1 tablet that’s made for gaming. Asus
has been selling versions of this 13.4 inch tablet for a few years.

Gaming laptops are usually big, heavy machines that sacrifice battery
life and portability for high-performance hardware. But over the past

<h2 id="the-future-of-htmx">The future of htmx</h2>
<p>date: 2025-01-06, updated: 2025-01-06, from: Simon Willison’s
Weblog</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="https://htmx.org/essays/future/">The future of
htmx</a></strong>
</p>
Carson Gross and Alex Petros lay out an ambitious plan for
<a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>: stay stable, add few features and
try to earn the same reputation for longevity that jQuery has (estimated
to be used on
<a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library">75.3%
of websites</a>).
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In particular, we want to emulate these technical characteristics of
jQuery that make it such a low-cost, high-value addition to the toolkits
of web developers. Alex has discussed
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lASLZ9TgXyc">“Building The 100
Year Web Service”</a> and we want htmx to be a useful tool for exactly
that use case.
</p>
<p>
Websites that are built with jQuery stay online for a very long time,
and websites built with htmx should be capable of the same (or better).
</p>
<p>
Going forward, htmx will be developed with its <em>existing</em> users
in mind. […]
</p>
<p>
People shouldn’t feel pressure to upgrade htmx over time unless there
are specific bugs that they want fixed, and they should feel comfortable
that the htmx that they write in 2025 will look very similar to htmx
they write in 2035 and beyond.

<p>
I don’t think people really appreciate how simple ARC-AGI-1 was, and
what solving it really means.
</p>
<p>
It was designed as the simplest, most basic assessment of fluid
intelligence possible. Failure to pass signifies a near-total inability
to adapt or problem-solve in unfamiliar situations.
</p>
<p>
Passing it means your system exhibits non-zero fluid intelligence –
you’re finally looking at something that isn’t pure memorized skill. But
it says rather little about how intelligent your system is, or how close
to human intelligence it is.

<strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/01/05/agents-ai-chatbots-google-mariner/">AI’s
next leap requires intimate access to your digital life</a></strong>
</p>
I’m quoted in this Washington Post story by Gerrit De Vynck about
“agents” - which in this case are defined as AI systems that operate a
computer system like a human might, for example
<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/22/computer-use/">Anthropic’s
Computer Use demo</a>.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“The problem is that language models as a technology are inherently
gullible,” said Simon Willison, a software developer who has tested many
AI tools, including Anthropic’s technology for agents. “How do you
unleash that on regular human beings without enormous problems coming
up?”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I got the closing quote too:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“If you ignore the safety and security and privacy side of things, this
stuff is so exciting, the potential is amazing,” Willison said. “I just
don’t see how we get past these problems.”
</p>
