<h2 id="why-i-feel-bad-about-biden">Why I feel bad about Biden</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: Dave Winer’s Scripting News</p>
<p>
Podcast:
<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/scripting.com/2024/08/22/whyIFeelBadAboutWhatHappenedToPresidentBidenInAPersonalWay.m4a">17
minutes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note: You can skip the first five minutes, it’s a long preamble on a
different subject. I left it in because it’s interesting imho.
</p>
<p>
It’s possible that what happened to Joe Biden in the debate is like
something that happened to me almost ten years ago when I was turning
60. I tell the story in this podcast. It’s still possible he was the
best choice to go against Trump. We’ll know soon enough. But there’s
something to learn here. No one wants their life to be over. No one
wants to be thanked. They want you to let them keep going. The thing is
that all through life people say you can’t do what you then go on to do.
It happens over and over. One day, after a life of accomplishment, you
realize everyone refers to you in the past tense, but you’re still here,
you want to keep doing the stuff you do so well. But they won’t let you.
That’s why I feel bad about what happened with President Biden, because
I’ve had the experience myself. Anyway what’s done is done, we all have
to get behind soon-to-be President Harris. And stand behind her as she
is attacked, and they try to get rid of her.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the substance of this podcast, which I recorded yesterday,
doesn’t start until 5:25. Up until then it’s a rambling story about Fox
News and how a little truth slipped out when they covered the
assassination attempt on Trump a few weeks ago. You can skip over that
part if you don’t find it interesting, but I hope you do listen to the
part when I had an experience that may have been like Biden’s at the
debate, and how it was probably just a panic attack – these things
happen – our candidates are people, and they have bodies that do strange
things sometimes. No matter what I feel for Biden and that’s the story I
wanted to tell here.
</p>
<p>
Thanks for listening. <span class="spOldSchoolEmoji">😄</span>

says Microsoft’s next big Windows 11 update will improve Zen 5 CPU
performance</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: OS News</p>
<p>AMD says Microsoft’s upcoming Windows 11 version 24H2 update will
improve performance for its new Zen 5 CPUs. The Ryzen 9000 series
launched earlier this month, and failed to live up to AMD’s performance
promises in most reviews. After rumors of a Windows bug, AMD has
revealed that AMD-specific branch prediction code will be optimized in
Windows 11 version 24H2, which is expected to ship next month. ↫ Tom
Warren at The Verge It’s wild how seemingly small things can have a
major impact on the launch of a new processor (or GPU) line these days.
The main culprit behind the disappointing benchmarks upon launch of the
Ryzen 9000 series turned out to be the 9000’s new branch prediction
method, the code for which is not yet available in Windows. However, AMD
ran their tests in “Admin mode”, which yielded results as if such code
was actually present. AMD has said the branch prediction code needed to
unlock the full potential of Ryzen 9000 chips in Windows and yield
benchmark results comparable to AMD’s own internal tests and PR
promiseswill be released next month as part of “Windows 11, version 24H2
in preview through the Windows Insider Program (Release Preview Channel
– Build 26100) or by downloading the ISO here“. AMD claims this update
will benefit users of previous Zen 5 and Zen 3 processors as well, but
to a lesser degree. No word on if this issue affects Linux users in any
way.</p>

<h2 id="the-stripped-down-tesla-is-exactly-what-we-need">The
Stripped-Down Tesla Is Exactly What We Need</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzUwNTEwMi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc0MDc1NTczN30.xgl1mYAA13i8Ik565f2nIVyCkQXkm9lBVIF47SePwtc/image.png?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
South of the border, Tesla quietly made its electric vehicles a little
simpler.
</p>
<p>
The independent Tesla-tracking website
<a href="https://www.notateslaapp.com/news/2198/tesla-makes-significant-changes-to-model-3-in-mexico" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Not
A Tesla App</u></a> recently shared news of a subtle change to the Tesla
Model 3 that’s offered in Mexico compared to those for sale in the U.S.
In place of the vegan faux leather that had been the sole option for its
seats, Tesla offered ordinary cloth fabric as a choice. Luxury touches
such as the heated or cooled seats aren’t available in this version of
the Model 3. Nor is the rear touchscreen for backseat passengers to
control their own temperature settings, a key addition to the redesigned
Model 3 that recently debuted.
</p>
<p>
These changes don’t knock a lot off the cost of the EV: This rear-wheel
drive 3 still costs 749,000 pesos, or about $40,000. But the
introduction of a more stripped-down Tesla could be a signal that, just
maybe, a more affordable Tesla is around the corner.
</p>
<p>
There’s no getting around it: Money may be the biggest stumbling block
for EVs in the United States — at least as range anxiety dissipates
thanks to better battery technology, growing charger networks, and
people simply having more exposure to electric vehicles. The gap may be
closing, but, in general, new EVs remain pricier than entry-level gas
cars. Meanwhile, high interest rates are depressing auto sales of every
kind and making comparably expensive EVs seem out of reach.
</p>
<p>
Electrics are expensive because of the costs to make their enormous
batteries, the need to retool assembly lines to build a whole new kind
of car, and other reasons mostly related to manufacturing. But on top of
all that, they’re expensive because of how they’re positioned as a
product. To get people excited about electric cars and see them not just
as wimpy golf carts, carmakers led by Tesla sold the EV as the
tech-forward ride of tomorrow. The look of EVs became all touchscreens
and LEDs, smartphone features that meant to have us equate “electric”
with “future.”
</p>
<p>
That design approach, combined with an emphasis on the zoominess an
electric powertrain can deliver, gave EVs a sheen of luxury, even though
the spartan conditions inside a Tesla bear little resemblance to the
cushy environs of a Mercedes-Benz. It allowed Tesla — and Rivian and
Lucid — to keep their startup companies afloat by selling expensive cars
at the outset to maximize revenue. (It didn’t hurt that the high sticker
price provided some room to hide the cost of the battery.)
</p>
<p>
That worked for the first phase of the EV revolution, when early tech
adopters and climate-focused drivers jumped in. But that era is over. As
the next era begins, success or failure will rest with the millions of
people who make their car decisions on dollars and cents. The declining
cost of batteries as companies get better at building them will help the
electric vehicle get cheaper. But the other side of the coin is for
companies to start selling the EV as just a car — a better one than your
dinosaur gasoline-burner, yes, but not some smartphone on wheels sent
back from the future.
</p>
<p>
This isn’t an entirely foreign notion. Cars have long been sold with
various “trim levels” that include different packages of features at
different price tiers. They’re usually designated by the alphabet soup
you see at the end of a vehicle name, like Toyota Corolla XSE or Ford
F-150 STX. In the case of the F-150, the extra technology and
performance packages can <em><em>double</em></em> the starting price of
$37,000.
</p>
<p>
You might think this is an annoying way to buy a car. The system hooks
buyers with the promise of a low starting price, only for many to
realize the car they actually want is $15,000 more. At the very least,
though, it gives you the option to buy the cheap car if you can live
without the fancier wheels, heated seats, and advanced suspension.
</p>
<p>
Gasoline cars could stand to do better in this regard, but it’s
especially important for electric vehicles. Today’s market abounds with
crossover EVs that pass themselves off as luxurious to get away with a
price that bloats into the low $40,000s. Even with a few vehicles coming
in the $30,000s, like the basic trim level of the Chevy Equinox EV and
the promised revival of the Chevy Bolt, the useful-but-simple EV is a
rare thing.
</p>
<p>
An EV is still an EV if it’s unremarkable. It’s just as good for
reducing greenhouse emissions if it looks like my old Ford Escort on the
inside: plain cloth seats, chunky physical buttons, and an analog
speedometer on the dash. In many ways, it’d be better.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps this is the pathway to what Tesla, Ford, and others envision
when they
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/730514/tesla-model-3-mexico-interior/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>promise
us</u></a> the $25,000 EV. You’ll probably give up a little in terms of
battery size and range, and lose some of the amenities and creature
comforts. But what you get, finally, is a truly affordable EV. As
someone who grew up on dead-simple transportation, I’d welcome it.

<li>Ford pumps the breaks on EV plans
</h3>
<p>
Yesterday Ford announced it is canceling its much-anticipated three-row
EV crossover and producing it only as a hybrid, and delaying the release
of a new medium-sized electric pickup truck to 2027. The moves deal a
substantial blow to the company’s future EV offerings and mean “the
North American car market may not see the explosive growth of EV options
— the kind of efflorescence already happening in Europe and China —
until the end of this decade,”

<p>
U.S. sales of electric vehicles actually reached a record high in the
second quarter of 2024,
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q2-2024-ev-sales/" target="_blank">hitting
330,463</a>. That’s a 11.3% rise year-over-year, and a 23% jump compared
to the first quarter. Ford’s quarterly EV sales were up 61%
year-over-year. “The growth will, at times, be very slow, as all-time
horizons in the automobile business are vast, but the long-term
trajectory suggests that higher volumes of EVs will continue over time,”
<a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/q2-2024-ev-sales/" target="_blank">said</a>
Cox Automotive Industry Insights Director Stephanie Valdez Streaty. “As
EV infrastructure and technology improve, and more models are launched,
many shoppers sitting on the fence will eventually choose an EV.”

The U.S. economy added 800,000 fewer jobs than originally thought
between the first quarter of last year and this year, according to
updated data from the Labor Department. It’s no crisis, but it does mean
the labor market has been cooling faster than expected. It’s yet another
reason people will be dissecting every signal they can from the Federal
Reserve on when it might cut interest rates. Also, startups are
increasingly a target for spies.

id="dispute-stops-canadian-freight-railroads-could-cause-us-disruption">Dispute
stops Canadian freight railroads, could cause US disruption</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>TORONTO — Both of Canada’s major freight railroads have come to a
full stop because of a contract dispute with their workers, an impasse
that could bring significant economic harm to businesses and consumers
in Canada and the U.S. if the trains don’t resume running soon.</p>
<p>Canadian National and CPKC railroads both locked out their employees
after the deadline of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Thursday passed without new
agreements with the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference that represents
some 10,000 engineers, conductors and dispatchers.</p>
<p>All rail traffic in Canada and all shipments crossing the U.S. border
have stopped, although CPKC and CN’s trains will continue to operate in
the U.S. and Mexico.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars of goods each month move between Canada and the
U.S. via rail, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>“If rail traffic grinds to a halt, businesses and families across the
country will feel the impact,” Jay Timmons, president and CEO of the
National Association of Manufacturers, said in a statement.
“Manufacturing workers, their communities and consumers of all sorts of
products will be left reeling from supply chain disruptions.”</p>
<p>There will be other impacts as well, including on the more than
30,000 commuters in Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal who will be
scrambling to find a new way into work because their trains won’t be
able to operate over CPKC’s tracks while the railroad is shut down.</p>
<p>Business groups had urged the government to intervene, but Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau has declined to force both sides into
arbitration.</p>
<p>CN said it was waiting for a response on one final offer made late
Wednesday when it locked the workers out. CPKC spokesperson Patrick
Waldron said the union rejected its last offer that CEO Keith Creel made
at the table in person. Both railroads have said they would end the
lockout if the union agreed to binding arbitration.</p>
<p>“Despite the lockout, the Teamsters remain at the bargaining table
with both companies,” the union said in a statement.</p>
<p>CN had been negotiating with the Teamsters for nine months while CPKC
had been trying to reach an agreement for a year, the unions said.</p>
<p>Many companies across all industries rely on railroads to deliver
their raw materials and finished products, so without regular rail
service they may have to cut back or even close.</p>
<p>That’s why the U.S. government kept rail workers from going on strike
two years ago and forced them to accept a contract despite their
concerns about demanding schedules and the lack of paid sick time.</p>
<p>Canada’s railroads have sometimes shut down briefly in the past
during contract negotiations — most recently CPKC was offline for a
couple of days in March 2022 — but it is rare for both railroads to stop
at the same time. The impact on businesses will be magnified because
both CN and CPKC have stopped.</p>
<p>Both CN and CPKC had been gradually shutting down since last week
ahead of the contract deadline. Shipments of hazardous chemicals and
perishable goods were the first to stop, so they wouldn’t be stranded
somewhere on the tracks.</p>
<p>As the Canadian contract talks were coming down to the wire, one of
the biggest U.S. railroads, CSX, broke with the U.S. freight rail
industry’s longstanding practice of negotiating jointly for years with
the unions. CSX reached a deal with several of its 13 unions that cover
25% of its workers ahead of the start of national bargaining later this
year.</p>
<p>The new five-year contracts will provide 17.5% raises, better
benefits and vacation time if they are ratified. The unions that have
signed deals with CSX include part of the SMART-TD union representing
conductors in one region, the Transportation Communications Union, the
Brotherhood of Railway Carmen and the Transport Workers Union. TCU
President Artie Maratea said he’s proud that his union reached a deal
“without years of unnecessary delay and stall tactics.”</p>
<p>Trudeau has been reluctant to force arbitration because he doesn’t
want to offend the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference and other unions,
but he urged both sides to reach a deal Wednesday because of the
tremendous economic damage that would follow a full shutdown.</p>
<p>“It is in the best interest of both sides to continue doing the hard
work at the table,” Trudeau said to reporters in Gatineau, Quebec.
“Millions of Canadians, workers, farmers, businesses, right across the
country, are counting on both sides to do the work and get to a
resolution.”</p>
<p>Numerous business groups have been urging Trudeau to act.</p>
<p>Trudeau said Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon met with both sides in
the CN talks in Montreal on Tuesday and would be on hand for the CPKC
talks in Calgary, Alberta. MacKinnon later said he wrapped up his
meetings with the rail companies and the Teamsters.</p>
<p>’Workers, farmers, commuters and businesses can’t wait. Canadians
need urgency at the table. The parties need to get deals done now,” he
posted on the social platform X.</p>
<p>The negotiations are stuck on issues related to the way rail workers
are scheduled and concerns about rules designed to prevent fatigue and
provide adequate rest to train crews. Both railroads had proposed
shifting away from the existing system, which pays workers based on the
miles in a trip, to an hourly system they said would make it easier to
provide predictable time off.</p>
<p>The railroads said their contract offers have included raises
consistent with recent deals in the industry. Engineers make about
$150,000 a year on Canadian National while conductors earn $120,000, and
CPKC says its wages are comparable.</p>
<p>Similar quality-of-life concerns about demanding schedules and the
lack of paid sick time nearly led to a U.S. rail strike two years ago
until Congress and President Joe Biden intervened and forced the unions
to accept a deal.</p>
<p>Manufacturing companies may have to scale back or even shut down
production if they can’t get rail service, while ports and grain
elevators will quickly become clogged with shipments waiting to move.
And if the dispute drags on for a couple weeks, water treatment plants
all across Canada might have to scramble without new shipments of
chlorine.</p>
<p>Some companies would undoubtedly turn to trucking to keep some of
their products moving, but there’s no way to make up for the volume
railroads deliver. It would take some 300 trucks to haul everything just
one train can carry.</p>

id="harris-running-mate-tim-walz-introduces-himself-to-the-nation">Harris’
running mate, Tim Walz, introduces himself to the nation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted his party’s nomination for
vice president Wednesday night, using his Democratic National Convention
address to thank the packed arena for “bringing the joy” to an election
transformed by the elevation of his running mate, Vice President Kamala
Harris.</p>
<p>“We’re all here tonight for one beautiful, simple, reason: We love
this country,” Walz said as thousands of delegates hoisted vertical
placards reading “Coach Walz” in red, white and blue.</p>
<p>Walz described his upbringing in Nebraska and teaching and coaching
football in Minnesota and told the crowd, “Thank you for bringing the
joy to this fight.”</p>
<p>“While other states were banning books from their schools, we were
banishing hunger from ours,” he said. In a dig at his Republican
counterpart, JD Vance, he added, “I had 24 kids in my high school class,
and none of them went to Yale.”</p>
<p>When Walz talked about the difficulty conceiving his daughter, Hope,
she made a heart with her hands and held it over her chest. His son,
Gus, wept watching his dad speak and at least once shouted, “That’s my
dad!”</p>
<p>“I haven’t given a lot of speeches like this, but I’ve given a lot of
pep talks,” Walz said.</p>
<p>Democrats gathered at Chicago’s United Center are hoping to build on
the momentum Harris has brought since taking over the top of the party’s
presidential ticket last month. They want to harness the Democratic
exuberance that followed President Joe Biden stepping aside while also
making clear to their supporters that they face a fierce battle with
former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Many Americans had never heard of Walz until Harris made him her
running mate. In his first weeks of campaigning, he’s charmed supporters
with his background and helped to balance Harris’ coastal background as
a cultural representative of Midwestern states whose voters she needs
this fall.</p>
<p>But Walz also has faced scrutiny, including questions about
embellishing his background. His wife this week clarified that she did
not undergo in vitro fertilization, as Walz has repeatedly claimed, but
used other fertility treatments. Republicans also have criticized Walz
for a 2018 comment he made about carrying weapons in war. Though he
served in the National Guard for 24 years, he did not deploy to a war
zone.</p>
<p>Benjamin C. Ingman, one of Walz’s old high school students,
introduced the man many speakers — and Harris at times — have referred
to as “Coach Walz.” At Ingman’s prompting, many of Walz’s former players
decked out in their red and white jerseys took the stage to help
introduce him.</p>
<p>The Bill and Oprah show</p>
<p>Walz’s speech followed former President Bill Clinton who returned to
a place he knows well, the Democratic National Convention stage, to
denounce Donald Trump as selfish and praise Kamala Harris as focused on
the needs of Americans — firing up his party with his trademark
off-the-cuff flourishes.</p>
<p>Clinton was meant to add heft to a third DNC night headlined by vice
presidential nominee Tim Walz ’s introduction to a national
audience.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a pretty clear choice it seems to me. Kamala Harris, for
the people. And the other guy who has proved, even more than the first
go-around, that he’s about me, myself and I,” Clinton said.</p>
<p>The nation’s 42nd president and a veteran of his party’s political
convention going back decades, Clinton was once declared the “secretary
of explaining stuff” by Barack Obama, whose reelection bid in 2012 was
bolstered by a Clinton stemwinder at that year’s DNC.</p>
<p>Now 78 — the same age as Trump — Clinton’s delivery was sometimes
halting, his movements slower and he mispronounced Harris’ first name
twice. His left hand often shook when he wasn’t using it to grip the
lectern.</p>
<p>Still, he delivered several memorable, homespun pronouncements
including asking. “What does her opponent do with his voice? He mostly
talks about himself. So the next time you hear him, don’t count the
lies, count the I’s.”</p>
<p>Oprah Winfrey, who long hosted her signature TV talk show from
Chicago, picked up on one of Democrats’ favorite themes of late,
scoffing at Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance having once
derided “childless cat ladies” as he argued that Americans should be
having more children.</p>
<p>Winfrey said that if a burning house belonged to a “childless cat
lady,” neighbors would still help and “try to get that cat out,
too.”</p>
<p>“We are beyond ridiculous tweets and lies and foolery,” she said of
Trump, before referencing a recent comment he made to supporters about
only having to vote once more — for him — and never again.</p>
<p>“You’re looking at a registered independent who’s proud to vote again
and again and again, because that’s what Americans do,” she said.
“Voting is the best of America.”</p>
<p>A focus on ‘freedoms’</p>
<p>The night’s theme was “a fight for our freedoms,” with the
programming focusing on abortion access and other rights that Democrats
want to center in their campaign against Trump. Speaker after speaker
argued that their party wants to defend freedoms while Republicans want
to take them away.</p>
<p>Colorado Gov. Jared Polis used a prop that has become a convention
staple, an oversized book meant to represent the Heritage Foundation’s
Project 2025, a sweeping set of goals to shrink government and push it
to the right, if Trump wins. Polis even ripped a page from the
ceremonial volume and said he was going to keep it and show it to
undecided voters.</p>
<p>The former president has distanced himself from Project 2025, but its
key authors include his former top advisers. His running mate, JD Vance,
wrote the foreword for the Heritage Foundation CEO’s new book.</p>
<p>Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told the story of a woman in
her state, which enacted new abortion restrictions after the Supreme
Court overturned Roe v. Wade, who was forced to carry to term a child
with a fatal illness, only to watch the newborn die just hours after
birth.</p>
<p>Dana Nessel, Michigan’s attorney general and an openly gay woman,
declared, “I got a message for the Republicans and the justices of the
U.S. Supreme Court: You can pry this wedding band from my cold, dead,
gay hand.”</p>
<p>Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi spoke about the attack on the
U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He chaired a congressional committee that
investigated the mob overrunning the Capitol, saying, “They wanted to
stop the peaceful transfer of power for the first time in American
history.”</p>
<p>“Thank God they failed,” Thompson said.</p>
<p>Trump bashed the convention as a “charade” and noted the fact that he
has been a frequent topic of conversation. He also singled out his
predecessor, Obama, for a highly critical convention speech Tuesday
night, saying Obama had been “nasty.”</p>
<p>A recognition of the Oct. 7 hostages</p>
<p>Democrats recognized the hostages still being held by Hamas after its
October 7 attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed. Jon and
Rachel Goldberg-Polin brought some in the arena to tears as they paid
tribute to their son Hersh, who was abducted in the attack.</p>
<p>Freeing hostages “is not a political issue. It is a humanitarian
issue,” Jon Goldberg-Polin said, adding that “in a competition of pain
there are no winners.”</p>
<p>The Israel-Hamas war has split the Democratic base, with
pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrating outside the United Center and
several speakers this week acknowledging civilian deaths in the Israeli
offensive in Gaza. More than 40,000 people have died in Gaza, according
to local health authorities.</p>

id="mexico-to-charge-drug-lord-for-delivering-another-drug-lord-to-us">Mexico
to charge drug lord for delivering another drug lord to US</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY — The strange saga of how two Mexican drug lords were
detained after landing in a plane in the United States in July just got
stranger.</p>
<p>The Mexican government now says it is bringing charges against
Joaquín Guzmán López, but not because he was a leader of the Sinaloa
drug cartel founded by his father, Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.</p>
<p>Instead, Mexican prosecutors are bringing charges against the younger
Guzmán for apparently kidnapping Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada — an older
drug boss from a rival faction of the cartel — forcing him onto the
plane and flying to an airport near El Paso, Texas.</p>
<p>The younger Guzmán apparently intended to turn himself in to U.S.
authorities, but may have brought Zambada along as a prize to sweeten
any plea deal.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors issued a statement saying “an arrest warrant has
been prepared” against the younger Guzmán for kidnapping.</p>
<p>But it also cited another charge under an article of Mexico’s
criminal code that defines what he did as treason. That section of the
law says treason is committed “by those who illegally abduct a person in
Mexico in order to hand them over to authorities of another
country.”</p>
<p>That clause was apparently motivated by the abduction of a Mexican
doctor wanted for allegedly participating in the 1985 torture and
killing of Drug Enforcement Administration agent Kiki Camarena.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the statement does it mention that the younger Guzmán was
a member of the “little Chapos” faction of the Sinaloa cartel, made up
of Chapo’s sons, that smuggles millions of doses of the deadly opioid
fentanyl into the United States, causing about 70,000 overdose deaths
each year.</p>
<p>The federal prosecutors’ statement also included an unusually harsh
and revealing description about evidence presented by prosecutors in the
northern state of Sinaloa that has since proved to be false.</p>
<p>Sinaloa state prosecutors were apparently trying to distance the
state’s governor, Rubén Rocha, from the killing of a local political
rival, Hector Cuén, who was at a meeting that was used as a pretext for
luring Zambada to the abduction site. Zambada has said he expected the
governor to be at that meeting; Rocha has said he made a trip out of the
state that day.</p>
<p>To play down reports of the purported meeting, state prosecutors
published a video of an apparent shooting during what they claimed was a
botched robbery at a local gas station. They said Cuén was killed there,
not at the meeting site, where Zambada said Cuén was murdered.</p>
<p>While federal prosecutors stopped short of saying the gas station
video was a fake, they earlier noted that the number of gunshots heard
on the video didn’t match the number of gunshot wounds on Cuén’s
body.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the federal prosecutors went further, saying the video
“is unacceptable, nor does it have sufficient value as evidence to be
taken into account.”</p>
<p>Zambada has said that Guzmán, whom he trusted, had invited him to the
meeting to help iron out the fierce political rivalry between Cuén and
Rocha. Zambada was known for eluding capture for decades because of his
incredibly tight, loyal and sophisticated personal security
apparatus.</p>
<p>The fact that he would knowingly leave that all behind to meet with
Rocha means that Zambada viewed such a meeting as credible and feasible.
The same goes for the idea that Zambada, as the leader of the oldest
wing of the Sinaloa cartel, could act as an arbiter in the state’s
political disputes.</p>
<p>The governor has denied he knew of or attended the meeting where
Zambada was abducted.</p>

id="pro-palestinian-protesters-rally-march-on-democratic-conventions-3rd-night">Pro-Palestinian
protesters rally, march on Democratic convention’s 3rd night</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — More than 2,000 pro-Palestinian protesters marched
Wednesday past a park where pro-Israel demonstrators had gathered
earlier and toward the arena hosting the third night of the Democratic
National Convention.</p>
<p>The demonstration, which stayed largely peaceful, came a day after
violent clashes between police and protesters led to 56 arrests at a
much smaller unsanctioned protest outside the Israeli Consulate.</p>
<p>Organizers of Wednesday’s demonstration drew on the Chicago area’s
Palestinian community, one of the largest in the country, by bringing
buses from suburban mosques.</p>
<p>Raed Shuk, 48, came with his children from the suburbs, including his
2-year-old son, who sat on Shuk’s shoulders ahead of the march. Shuk,
whose parents are Palestinian, said they have come to so many rallies
that his son knows the chants by heart.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s humanity needs to be equally addressed here and there,”
he said of Gaza. “I want to help my children learn from this experience
that you always like to stand up for your rights and always peacefully
protest.”</p>
<p>The march, one of the largest anticipated demonstrations of the week,
took on a festive tone at times as a drum line led marchers and a sea of
Palestinian flags waved above the crowds. Some kids ate popsicles as
they walked, and others were pushed in strollers or rode in wagons.</p>
<p>The crowd stopped outside a park that is roughly a block from the
United Center and used megaphones and air horns to call out elected
leaders, including Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, for being
“complicit” in the war in Gaza. The two-term Democrat, who was under
consideration as Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, criticized
a cease-fire resolution Chicago approved in January.</p>
<p>The crowds of pro-Palestinian protesters included many families and
people of different faiths. Small groups of Muslims gathered in prayer
at a park just ahead of the march’s kickoff, using keffiyeh as prayer
rugs. Rabbis were among the leaders of the march, and a small group
marched through in the crowd holding a sign that said, “Christians for
Ceasefire.”</p>
<p>Rabbi Brant Rosen, a founder of the Jewish Voice for Peace Rabbinical
Council, condemned Democrats for not speaking out about the war in Gaza
at the convention.</p>
<p>“The word Palestine is not allowed inside the Democratic National
Convention. The word cease-fire has barely been uttered,” he said. “This
is a Hollywood-style coronation of a candidate. They assume they are
entitled to our votes, but they are not entitled to our votes.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, police escorted pro-Israel demonstrators out of a
park near the United Center as the area was blocked off ahead of the
march of activists heading there.</p>
<p>The rally near the United Center was organized by the U.S.
Palestinian Community Network, a Palestinian and Arab community-based
organization. It was in stark contrast to the protest Tuesday night
outside the Israeli Consulate. Protesters not affiliated with a
coalition of more than 200 groups that have the city’s permission for
demonstrations ended up in an intense standoff with Chicago police.</p>
<p>Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said those arrested
Tuesday night outside the Israeli Consulate, about 3.2 kilometers from
the United Center, “showed up with the intention of committing acts of
violence, vandalism.” Snelling called the police response
“proportionate.”</p>
<p>Thirty of the people detained by police were issued citations for
disorderly conduct, according to Chicago police. One person was arrested
on a felony charge of resisting police, while nine were charged with
misdemeanors including disorderly conduct, resisting officers, battery,
assault and criminal damage to property, police said.</p>
<p>Snelling said that two people were taken to the hospital with minor
injuries, one for knee pain and one with a finger injury. Two officers
were injured, but they refused medical attention because they did not
want to leave fellow officers, Snelling said. He said three journalists
were among those arrested, but he did not have details on charges.</p>
<p>Hatem Abudayyeh, co-founder of the U.S. Palestinian Community
Network, put the onus on police to keep the peace when asked about the
clashes between pro-Palestinian protesters and police. The police “only
have one responsibility here,” he said. “They have the responsibility of
not infringing on our First Amendment rights.”</p>
<p>The Israeli Consulate has been the site of numerous demonstrations
since the war in Gaza began in October, and protests during the DNC have
largely focused on opposing the Israel-Hamas war.</p>
<p>The largest protest so far, which attracted about 3,500 people on
Monday, was largely peaceful and resulted in 13 arrests, most related to
a breach of security fencing. Two were arrested Sunday night during
another mostly peaceful march.</p>

id="california-announces-new-deal-with-tech-to-fund-journalism-ai-research">California
announces new deal with tech to fund journalism, AI research</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California will be the first U.S. state to
direct millions of dollars from taxpayer money and tech companies to
help pay for journalism and AI research under a new deal announced
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Under the first-in-the-nation agreement, the state and tech companies
would collectively pay roughly $250 million over five years to support
California-based news organization and create an AI research program.
The initiatives are set to kick in in 2025 with $100 million the first
year, and the majority of the money would go to news organizations, said
Democratic Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, who brokered the deal.</p>
<p>“This agreement represents a major breakthrough in ensuring the
survival of newsrooms and bolstering local journalism across California
— leveraging substantial tech industry resources without imposing new
taxes on Californians,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. “The deal
not only provides funding to support hundreds of new journalists but
helps rebuild a robust and dynamic California press corps for years to
come, reinforcing the vital role of journalism in our democracy.”</p>
<p>Wicks’ office didn’t immediately answer questions about specifics on
how much funding would come from the state, which news organizations
would be eligible and how much money would go to the AI research
program.</p>
<p>The deal effectively marks the end of a yearlong fight between tech
giants and lawmakers over Wicks’ proposal to require companies like
Google, Facebook and Microsoft to pay a certain percentage of
advertising revenue to media companies for linking to their content.</p>
<p>The bill, modelled after a legislation in Canada aiming at providing
financial help to local news organizations, faced intense backlash from
the tech industry, which launched ads over the summer to attack the
bill. Google also tried to pressure lawmakers to drop the bill by
temporarily removing news websites from some people’s search results in
April.</p>
<p>“This partnership represents a cross-sector commitment to supporting
a free and vibrant press, empowering local news outlets up and down the
state to continue in their essential work,” Wicks said in a statement.
“This is just the beginning.”</p>
<p>California has tried different ways to stop the loss of journalism
jobs, which have been disappearing rapidly as legacy media companies
have struggled to profit in the digital age. More than 2,500 newspapers
have closed in the U.S. since 2005, according to Northwestern
University’s Medill School of Journalism. California has lost more than
100 news organizations in the past decade, according to Wicks’
office.</p>
<p>The Wednesday agreement is supported by California News Publishers
Association, which represents more than 700 news organizations, Google’s
corporate parent Alphabet and OpenAI. But journalists, including those
in Media Guild of the West, slammed the deal and said it would hurt
California news organizations.</p>
<p>State Sen. Steve Glazer, who authored a bill to provide news
organizations a tax credit for hiring full-time journalists, said the
agreement “seriously undercuts our work toward a long-term solution to
rescue independent journalism.”</p>
<p>State Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire also said the deal
doesn’t go far enough to address the dire situation in California.</p>
<p>“Newsrooms have been hollowed out across this state while tech
platforms have seen multi-billion-dollar profits,” he said in a
statement. “We have concerns that this proposal lacks sufficient funding
for newspapers and local media and doesn’t fully address the inequities
facing the industry.”</p>

<h2 id="senior-us-officials-meet-dalai-lama-in-new-york">Senior US
officials meet Dalai Lama in New York</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Senior US officials met with the Dalai Lama in New York
on Wednesday, according to the State Department, in a rare high-level
direct meeting between Washington and the exiled Tibetan spiritual
leader. </p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, who is denounced by Beijing as a separatist, met with
senior State Department official Uzra Zeya and White House National
Security Council official Kelly Razzouk in New York, where he is
visiting to receive medical treatment.  </p>
<p>During the meeting, Zeya “reaffirmed the US commitment to advancing
the human rights of Tibetans and supporting efforts to preserve their
distinct historical, linguistic, cultural, and religious heritage.” </p>
<p>Beijing imposes strict controls on Tibet, which it considers an
inalienable part of its territory, and denounces the Dalai Lama – who
advocates for greater Tibetan autonomy – as a rebel.  </p>
<p>During the meeting on Wednesday, Zeya also discussed US “support for
resuming dialogue between the PRC and His Holiness and his
representatives,” the statement said, using an abbreviation for the
People’s Republic of China. </p>
<p>Talks between Beijing and Tibetan leaders have been frozen since
2010. </p>
<p>Beijing on Thursday condemned the meeting, accusing the Dalai Lama of
being “a political exile engaged in anti-China separatist activities
under the guise of religion.” </p>
<p>“China firmly opposes any country allowing the Dalai Lama to visit
under any pretext and strongly opposes any form of meetings between
government officials of any country and the Dalai Lama,” foreign
ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. </p>
<p>Beijing had “lodged a strong protest” with Washington, she
added. </p>
<p>The Dalai Lama, 89, received knee surgery in New York this year, and
said he was recovering well in a statement released in July.  </p>
<p>He stepped down as his people’s political head in 2011, passing the
baton of secular power to a government chosen democratically by some
130,000 Tibetans around the world. </p>
<p>In July, China sanctioned a US lawmaker for “interference” over his
support for Tibetans, a month after the US Congress passed a law
strengthening support for Tibet and senior US lawmakers met with the
Dalai Lama in India.  </p>
<p>China took control of Tibet in 1951, and the Dalai Lama fled into
exile in 1959. </p>
<p>Tibet had previously been largely autonomous following the fall of
the Qing dynasty, which lasted three centuries.</p>

York man accused of spying on Chinese dissidents, DOJ says</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-22, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A New York man was charged on Wednesday with operating
as an illegal agent of the Chinese government in the United States,
accusing him of spying on Chinese pro-Democracy activists and
dissidents, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>The DOJ alleges that Yuanjun Tang, 67, acted as a Chinese agent
between 2018 and 2023 at the direction of China’s Ministry of State
Security, its principal intelligence agency.</p>
<p>Tang gave to MSS intelligence officers information about individuals
and groups viewed by China “as potentially adverse” to its interests,
including prominent U.S.-based Chinese dissidents, the DOJ said.</p>
<p>He helped MSS infiltrate a group chat on an encrypted messaging
application used by numerous Chinese dissidents, the DOJ said.</p>
<p>Tang is also accused of making false statements to the FBI when he
claimed he was no longer able to access an email account used to
communicate with his MSS handler, the department said.</p>
<p>Tang is a former Chinese citizen who was imprisoned for his
activities as a dissident, according to the department. He was granted
political asylum in the U.S. and later became a citizen.</p>
<p>The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for
comment. Reuters was unable to contact Tang.</p>

for far-right Oath Keepers group pleads guilty to Capitol riot
charges</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — An attorney who represented the far-right Oath Keepers
pleaded guilty on Wednesday to charges stemming from a mob’s Jan. 6,
2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including members of the extremist
group. </p>
<p>Kellye SoRelle, who was general counsel for the anti-government group
and a close associate of its founder, is scheduled to be sentenced on
January 17 by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C. </p>
<p>SoRelle, 45, of Granbury, Texas, answered routine questions by the
judge as she pleaded guilty to two charges: a felony count of
obstructing justice and a misdemeanor count of entering and remaining in
a restricted building or grounds. The felony carries a maximum prison
sentence of 20 years, but her estimated sentencing guidelines recommend
a maximum of 16 months behind bars. </p>
<p>SoRelle was arrested in Junction, Texas, in September 2022. Her case
remained suspended for months amid questions about her mental
health. </p>
<p>More than a year ago, medical experts concluded that SoRelle was
mentally incompetent to stand trial. In November 2023, she reported to a
federal Bureau of Prisons facility for treatment. Last month, Mehta
ruled that SoRelle had recovered to an extent that she could understand
the nature of her charges and could assist in her defense. </p>
<p>Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes is serving an 18-year prison
sentence for orchestrating a plot to keep Donald Trump in the White
House after the 2020 presidential election. After Rhodes’ arrest,
SoRelle told media outlets she was acting as the president of the Oath
Keepers in his absence. </p>
<p>SoRelle, a former Texas prosecutor, was photographed with Rhodes
outside the Capitol on January 6. As the riot erupted, she posted a chat
message for other Oath Keepers that said, “We are acting like the
founding fathers — can’t stand down. Per Stewart, and I concur.” </p>
<p>“Although SoRelle did not personally enter the Capitol Building on
January 6, she understood the role those inside and outside the
building, like herself, played in delaying the certification proceeding
that had been taking place inside the Capitol,” said a court filing
accompanying her guilty plea. </p>
<p>The night before the riot, she joined Rhodes in meeting with other
extremist group members in an underground garage in Washington, D.C. The
meeting also included former Proud Boys national leader Enrique Tarrio,
who is serving a 22-year prison sentence for his role in a separate plot
to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden after the
election. </p>
<p>Rhodes, a former U.S. Army paratrooper, founded the Oath Keepers in
2009. The group recruits current and former military, police and first
responders and pledges to “fulfill the oath all military and police take
to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and
domestic.” </p>
<p>During the trial for Rhodes and other Oath Keepers charged with
seditious conspiracy, jurors heard testimony that SoRelle had a romantic
relationship with Rhodes. </p>
<p>SoRelle pleaded guilty to obstructing justice for encouraging others
to destroy electronic evidence of their participation in the plot. Two
days after the riot, Rhodes and SoRelle both sent messages from her
cellphone encouraging Oath Keepers to delete any incriminating
evidence. </p>
<p>She was indicted on other charges, including conspiring with Rhodes
and other Oath Keepers to obstruct Congress from certifying the
Electoral College vote. But she did not plead guilty to the conspiracy
charge. </p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, a judge set a February 3 trial date for an
Illinois man charged with firing a gun during the riot. John Banuelos
climbed scaffolding outside the Capitol, took out his revolver and fired
two shots into the air, according to prosecutors. </p>
<p>Banuelos, of Summit, Illinois, was arrested in March. U.S. District
Judge Judge Tanya Chutkan refused on Wednesday to free Banuelos from
pretrial custody. She ruled that he poses a flight risk and a danger to
the public. </p>
<p>“It could have been much more tragic,” the judge said of the
gunshots.</p>

official holds talks in Africa on responsible use of military AI</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Abuja, Nigeria — A U.S. State Department official was in Nigeria this
week to meet with local and regional authorities about the responsible
use of artificial intelligence in military applications.</p>
<p>Mallory Stewart, assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Arms
Control, Deterrence and Stability, said her two-day visit with Nigerian
officials from the regional bloc ECOWAS was part of the United States’
commitment to deepen security cooperation in Africa.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has been working with 55 nations, including
African nations, “to agree upon responsible uses of AI in the military
context, using AI in a manner consistent with international laws [and]
recognizing inherent human bias,” Stewart told journalists
Wednesday.</p>
<p>“We’ve learned the hard way [that there is] inherent human bias built
into the AI system … leading to maybe misinformation being provided to
the decisionmaker,” she said.</p>
<p>The goal, she continued, “is to hear from as many countries as
possible that are at the stage of working in artificial intelligence to
their military to see how we can minimize the risks.”</p>
<p>Last year, the Global Terrorism Index report named sub-Saharan Africa
an epicenter of terrorism, accounting for nearly 60% of terror-related
deaths. It is unclear whether the terror groups are using AI.</p>
<p>Nigerian authorities have been pushing for the integration of
artificial intelligence in military operations, while acknowledging that
adopting AI will require Africa-specific policies.</p>
<p>Security analyst Kabiru Adamu of Beacon Consulting said the use of AI
in military operations has advantages.</p>
<p>“Given the position of the U.S. in terms of its military capacity and
technological advancement, it will definitely be in the position to
support Nigeria’s desires, especially if it’s able to contextualize some
of the peculiarities within the Nigerian security space,” Adamu said.
“We can’t isolate ourselves from the international committee of nations.
AI is embedded in security, so we have to do it. But we need to be
cognizant of the supporting infrastructure for good technology. Power is
one of them, culture.”</p>
<p>The founder of Global Sentinel online magazine, Senator Iroegbu, said
that while AI has benefits, the technology still needs to be treated
with caution.</p>
<p>“It limits casualties in terms of the number of soldiers that will be
deployed, so you conserve your boots,” Iroegbu said. “It helps penetrate
rough terrains, gather more intelligence. It’s good that there’s growing
awareness of the issue of artificial intelligence, but Nigeria needs to
first of all try to define its own policy and strategy with regards to
artificial intelligence. More sensitization needs to be done, and more
policy aspect of it needs to be developed.”</p>
<p>In June, African ministers unanimously endorsed landmark continental
AI strategy to advance Africa’s digital future and development
aspirations. And last week, the African Union approved the adoption of
AI in public and private sectors in member states, including
Nigeria.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-update-breaks-grub-on-dual-boot-systems">Microsoft
update breaks GRUB on dual-boot systems</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>Ah, secure boot, the bane of many running anything other than
Windows. While it’s already been found to be utterly useless by now,
it’s still a requirement for Windows 11, and ever since it became part
of PCs about a decade or so ago, it’s been causing headaches for people
who don’t use Windows. Yesterday, Microsoft released a patch for a
two-year-old vulnerability in the GRUB bootloader, and while the company
claimed it would only be installed on single-boot Windows machines, that
clearly wasn’t the case as right after its release, people dual-booting
Linux and Windows found their Linux installations unbootable. Tuesday’s
update left dual-boot devices—meaning those configured to run both
Windows and Linux—no longer able to boot into the latter when Secure
Boot was enforced. When users tried to load Linux, they received the
message: “Verifying shim SBAT data failed: Security Policy Violation.
Something has gone seriously wrong: SBAT self-check failed: Security
Policy Violation.” Almost immediately support and discussion forums lit
up with ​​reports of the failure. ↫ Dan Goodin at Ars Technica The fix is
both easy and hilarious: disable secure boot, and you’re good to go. You
can also get a bit more technical and remove the SBAT installed by this
update, but while that will allow you to keep booting with secure boot
enabled, it will leave you vulnerable to the issue the SBAT was supposed
to fix. The efficacy of secure boot in home environments is debatable,
at best, and while I’m not going to advise anyone to just turn it off
and forget about it, I think most OSNews readers can make an informed
decision about secure boot by themselves. If you’re using corporate
machines managed by your employer’s IT department, you obviously need to
refer to them. Microsoft itself has not yet commented on this issue, and
is not responding to questions from press outlets, so we’re currently in
the dark about how such a game-breaking update got out in the wild.
Regardless, this once again shows just how annoying secure boot is. In
many cases, the boot problems people trying out Linux run into caused by
secure boot, but of course, the blame is placed squarely on Linux, and
not on secure boot itself being a hot mess.</p>

Transition</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: Heatmap News</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Well, that’s not good.
</p>
<p>
Ford Motor Company is canceling one of its most anticipated electric
vehicles and delaying another EV project. The changes will cost at least
$400 million — and as much as $1.9 billion — the company said Wednesday,
and they signal that one of the biggest players in the American car
industry still hasn’t yet found a workable EV strategy. With these new
delays, the North American car market may not see the explosive growth
of EV options — the kind of efflorescence already happening in Europe
and China — until the end of this decade.
</p>
<p>
The primary car in question is Ford’s planned three-row EV crossover,
possibly its most anticipated EV model. The new car, which was
originally slated for release in 2023 before being bumped to 2025, will
now be produced only as a hybrid. That fits in with Ford’s recent
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/ford-maverick-hybrid-q1-sales" target="_self"><u>embrace
of hybrids</u></a> — by 2030, the company now says, it will
<a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2024/04/04/ford-delays-ev-launches-hybrid-lineup-2030/73201263007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>offer
a hybrid version</u></a> of each vehicle in its line-up — but it deals a
substantial blow to the company’s future EV offerings. Ford also
announced that it will delay the release of a new medium-sized electric
pickup truck to 2027. That truck, so far known only as “T3,” is meant to
be the first product of the company’s California-based skunkworks
staffed by Tesla alumni. That team is meant to help Ford develop a
low-cost, globally competitive
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/730922/ford-skunkworks-ev-midsize-compact/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>electric
vehicle platform</u></a> that could eventually undergird crossovers,
trucks, and commercial vehicles.
</p>
<p>
Taken together, these changes mean that the company will offer no new
electric vehicles in the consumer market for the next two years. Yes,
the company’s outlook for EVs in the commercial market is a little
brighter — Ford will begin selling an all-electric commercial van in
2026. But to entice the average buyer it will have to rely entirely on
existing models — the Mustang Mach E and F-150 Lightning — to generate
EV sales. The company will also cut back a quarter of its planned EV
spending. It’s not an overstatement to say that Ford seems to be giving
up on the consumer side of the EV transition until the back half of the
decade.
</p>
<p>
“Ford has some improvements coming in 2026, but they’re basically
throwing their hands up on the market,” Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at
the market research firm BloombergNEF, told me. “They’re essentially
ceding ground to other automakers in the U.S. market, and there’s a
clear lack of plan for how they plan to stay competitive.
</p>
<p>
“There’s no way you can say it’s a good thing for the U.S. EV market,”
he added.
</p>
<p>
Executives blamed the shifts on persistent challenges turning a profit
in its EV unit, which has hemorrhaged money as it has spun up
production, ultimately losing
<a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a60621256/ford-ev-revenue-losses-q1-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$130,000
on every EV</u></a> that it sold during the first quarter of 2024.
</p>
<p>
“These vehicles need to be profitable, and if they’re not profitable
based on where the customer is and the market is, we will … make those
tough decisions,” John Lawler, Ford’s chief financial officer,
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1f6633f2-a813-4e47-9276-ef191af01f05" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told
the </u><u><em><em>Financial Times</em></em></u></a>. The company could
not figure out how to reconcile the cost of the large battery needed for
the three-row SUV with the vehicle’s size and price in a way that could
turn a profit within 12 months, he
<a href="https://insideevs.com/news/730891/ford-three-row-electric-suv-dead/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>added</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Ford’s approach may reflect a canny understanding of consumer demand in
the American market. Although EVs are far better for the climate than
gasoline-burning vehicles, hybrids pollute
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/24/1158306767/prius-toyota-hybrids-electric-car-climate-change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>somewhat
less</u></a> than conventional gas guzzlers. Over the past few years, as
new EV models have trickled into the market, hybrid sales
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/hybrid-sales-south-fork-wind" target="_self"><u>have
boomed</u></a>, and that is, all things considered, a good thing:
Replacing America’s fleet of gasoline-burning SUVs and crossovers with a
hybrid fleet will still work to reduce emissions, although it will not
allow for the extremely rapid emissions reductions that could keep the
1.5 degree Celsius warming goal in sight.
</p>
<p>
More pertinently, perhaps, the shift also creates a strategic opening in
the American EV market. Tesla has long dominated U.S. market share, and
in the past few years, Ford has settled into a comfortable No. 2
position. But Tesla
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-episode-12-q1-ev-sales" target="_self"><u>has</u></a>
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-model-2" target="_self"><u>struggled</u></a>
with its own dearth of new models: Except for the luxury Cybertruck, the
automaker has no new cars or trucks in its pipeline. And now that Ford
appears to be taking a step back, the combined effect could create an
opening for other automakers — namely
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/hyundai-motor-group-kia-motors-ioniq-5-ev-6" target="_self"><u>Hyundai,
Kia</u></a>, or the startup
<a href="https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/rivian-earnings-r2-release" target="_self"><u>Rivian</u></a>
— to step into the breach in 2025 and 2026. If Ford’s timeline holds,
for instance, then Rivian will begin selling its widely awaited $45,000
R2 crossover in 2026, a year before Ford can offer anything new.
</p>
<p>
The shift also vindicates decision making at Ford’s cross-town
competitor, General Motors. While Ford sought to take an early lead by
manufacturing a few buzzy standalone EV models (like the Mach E), GM has
focused on developing a robust EV platform, the Ultium. Although its
initial Ultium-based releases had big deficiencies, its latest cars look
better, and the platform should allow it to begin manufacturing a
diverse lineup of cars and trucks in a relatively brief period of time.
“For all the knocking we did of GM, their thinking makes sense: First
you spin battery manufacturing up, then you put it in a lot of models,
then you find out which models work” in the broader market, Cantor told
me.
</p>
<p>
But perhaps the change in plans is most ominous for Ford’s cost model:
If it can’t get a three-row crossover to pencil out, how can it get
<em><em>any </em></em>kind of non-F-150 to work financially? Despite
Ford’s struggles to make its three-row SUV concept work, other companies
have already brought their own three-row electric vehicles to market. At
the high end, Rivian’s R1T has three rows, starts at $69,000, and is the
company’s best-selling vehicle. But Kia’s three-row EV9 starts at about
$55,000 before subsidies, and Hyundai is due to start selling its own
three-row SUV, the Ioniq 9, later this year. Other companies have found
a way to make EVs without breaking the bank. Why hasn’t Ford?
</p>
<p>
But if Ford and GM’s behavior makes more sense for the wealthier and
more cautious American consumer — in a country where public fast charger
installation is still lagging — then it indicates, too, just how much
America has fallen behind other global auto markets. On the same day
that Ford backed off its multi-year EV goals, the Chinese tech giant
Xiaomi
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d12e66d2-e548-4a85-a207-7ddb6ab2ac2a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a>
that it had already beaten its annual target for EV sales and turned a
profit while doing it<em><em>. </em></em>Xiaomi, BYD, and other Chinese
automakers are rushing into the EV market, seemingly capable of
producing more EVs, more cheaply and
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/26/business/byd-profit-soar-after-beats-tesla/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>profitably</u></a>,
than their American competitors. Ford’s retrenchment into gas cars means
that it has now fallen even further behind the global standard.

<p>Speaking of Michelle Obama, she made the
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-whos-going-to-tell-trump-that-hes-campaigning-for-a-black-job-michelle-obama-asks">most
powerful political statement</a> I’ve ever heard. “Who’s going to tell
Trump the job he’s currently seeking might just be one of those black
jobs.” The way she said it made you think. Here we are, and one way or
another, we <i>have</i> changed. America in 2024 is vastly different
from the American of 2008. America is moving both toward self-acceptance
and away from it at the same time. But here in the half of America my
feet are planted in, we realize that there isn’t a black America and a
white America, there’s just one America. We finally have come to accept
ourselves as we have been all along.</p>

There should be opportunities for independent developers to create for

a public resource. Of course big companies will take whatever isn’t

use <a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">PocketCasts</a> on my Android
phone as my main podcast-listening app. I also have a website,
<a href="http://dave.podcatch.com/">dave.podcatch.com</a>, that has the
latest episodes from the podcasts I follow. I would love to hook up my
<a href="http://scripting.com/publicfolder/feedland/subscriptionLists/dwPocketcastSubscriptions.opml">subscriptions</a>
from PocketCasts to dave.podcatch.com, so that I could add to the
website from my freaking phone. Make it really easy for me to pitch a
great podcast feed to my friends. But I can only export my feeds, I
can’t create a dynamic link between the two. If I ran a popular podcatch
app like Pocketcasts, I would open up my outbound subscription list, and
vie to be the default place people come to subscribe to podcasts. If a
few of my users were geeks and visionaries, they could start telling
other vendors they should hook up to my source lists, so they can use
Pocketcasts to subscribe. One place to subscribe is way better than
many. If you think things like that can’t happen, think again. How did
you all come to use <a href="http://opml.org/">OPML</a> for your
subscription lists? It’s because someone volunteered to go first, and
the users of that product demanded that other products support the
format. It still amazes me that there’s an interchange format there, but
we’ve barely begun to tap into the power there.</p>

Pacific territories near status upgrade at islands summit</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Two U.S. Pacific territories are moving closer to a
status upgrade from observer to associate member, elevating their status
within the region’s political and economic policy organization, the
Pacific Islands Forum.</p>
<p>The PIF leaders’ meeting is set to open Monday in Tonga’s capital,
Nuku’alofa.</p>
<p>Tongan Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni has confirmed there will be a
vote on new associate members. “Guam and American Samoa have applied,”
he told ABC Pacific recently. “We’ll be actually tabling a paper for the
leaders to consider.”</p>
<p>Foreign ministers from the Pacific bloc reviewed the applications for
associate member status from the two U.S. territories during their
meeting on August 9. Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown noted that
there is “widespread support” for the applications.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, forum leaders will engage in talks with United Nations
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, associate members and forum
observers. A senior State Department official will represent the United
States.</p>
<p>The Pacific Islands Forum has 18 member states, with Australia and
New Zealand being the largest economies in the bloc. Neither the United
States nor China is a full member, but both countries are dialogue
partners.</p>
<p>U.S. greenlights</p>
<p>Until recently, U.S. Pacific territories Guam, American Samoa and the
Northern Mariana Islands held observer status for the forum.</p>
<p>In June, however, the U.S. government eased restrictions, allowing
these territories to join the PIF as nonvoting associate members,
provided they do not take foreign policy positions. This change modified
a longstanding policy that had previously barred their participation in
international organizations.</p>
<p>Although the French territories of French Polynesia and New Caledonia
have become full PIF members, analysts currently do not anticipate that
U.S. Pacific territories will be approved for full membership soon.</p>
<p>“It would be a bit like Nebraska voting at the United Nations,” Cleo
Paskal, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense
of Democracies, told VOA.</p>
<p>“The degree to which constituent parts of the U.S., such as Guam and
American Samoa, can participate as full members in multilateral
organizations is complex,” she said. “On one hand, the people of those
islands understandably want to be represented in a forum that claims to
speak for the region. On the other, they can’t legally sign up to
foreign policy positions for the U.S.”</p>
<p>U.S.-PIF summit</p>
<p>A State Department spokesperson told VOA that the United States has
made broader and deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands a key
priority of its foreign policy.</p>
<p>The spokesperson cited the U.S.-hosted summit meetings with Pacific
Island leaders in Washington in September 2022 and 2023.</p>
<p>But neither the White House nor the State Department would confirm
whether a third U.S.-Pacific Island Forum summit will take place this
year.</p>
<p>In recent years, U.S. policymakers have recognized that U.S. presence
and influence in the Pacific cannot be taken for granted, especially in
the face of increased Chinese interest and engagement in the region,
according to Kathryn Paik, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies.</p>
<p>Paik recently wrote in a CSIS publication that Washington’s
realization has led to a series of high-level visits, the opening of
several new embassies, the return of the Peace Corps to the region, and
numerous financial initiatives across the fisheries, health, law
enforcement and economic sectors.</p>

I’ve noticed I spend less time programming, I go more slowly and
carefully because now I can know a lot more about each problem I’m
solving, and use the packages I build on, jQuery, MySQL, Node, the
browser, Bootstrap, Font-awesome, Frontier, to greater advantage. A new
kind of programming is possible, and it’s better.

I go into some detail in this podcast about how the process works.

“A federal judge has blocked the Federal Trade Commission’s ban on
noncompete agreements that make it difficult for workers to join their
employers’ rivals or launch competing businesses. The ruling prevents
the FTC’s ban on noncompete agreements from taking effect on September
4th, though the agency could still appeal the decision.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is such a blow. Non-competes are already illegal in California;
they’re inherently anti-worker and are also very clearly a hindrance to
innovation.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully the FTC appeals. The judge’s argument that it would cause
“irreparable harm” is nonsense: any business that has to protect itself
by not allowing its workforce to go work for a competitor is obviously
not competitive at what it does. Instead, businesses should seek to do
good work and create conditions so that workers <em>don’t want to leave
in the first place</em>. The solution is a better workplace, not legal
restrictions that prevent people from finding a different employer.

toddler on a road trip</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: Ben Werdmuller’s blog</p>
<div class="e-content entry-content">

</p>
<p>
This past week I embarked upon two long car drives — from Philadelphia
to Cape Cod and back again — with an almost-two year-old. He’s a
remarkably good traveler who takes everything in his stride (as long as
he has his puffy stickers and you agree to put Elmo on the radio from
time to time).
</p>
<p>
The biggest challenge was finding places for him to eat well:
restaurants that wouldn’t bat an eyelid at a toddler doing toddler
things at the table, that also would have the kinds of food that he
likes. (Yes, I packed snacks. But sometimes it’s time to sit down for a
real meal.)
</p>
<p>
We made it work, but it was always a bit of a guessing game. Would X
chain or Y mom-and-pop accommodate his needs? I found myself wishing
that there was some kind of app that would just recommend somewhere to
go — particularly as he could get hungry at a moment’s notice, and
faffing around with restaurant reviews while I was driving was an
impossibility.
</p>
<p>
So out of interest, once I returned, I asked ChatGPT for
recommendations:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Find a restaurant suitable for attending with a toddler in Elkins Park,
PA. Please just return the restaurant name and address; don’t share any
other information.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It returns:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The Creekside Co-op<br />7909 High School Rd, Elkins Park, PA 19027
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That’s pretty good! Creekside is a local marketplace and brewery near
where I live that absolutely is suitable for hanging out with a toddler.
</p>
<p>
I tried it in a few locations. In the part of Cape Cod where we were
staying, it suggested the <a href="https://moonakiscafe.com/">Moonakis
Cafe</a>, which is a superb choice. In the part of Oxford, England,
where I grew up, it suggested
<a href="https://butcombe.com/the-victoria-arms-oxfordshire/">The
Victoria Arms</a> — again, no complaints whatsoever. I’d eat there with
my little one in a heartbeat.
</p>
<p>
So what if I want to make this a simple app, starting on the web?
</p>
<p>
It turns out that you can replace the name of the location in the query
with its GPS coordinates, which simplifies matters a great deal. You can
get <a href="https://w3c.github.io/geolocation/">the user’s current
location via the web geolocation API</a>: you can then plug that
straight into the query, make an API call, and forward the user directly
to a Google Maps view for the restaurant. Reverse geocoding APIs, which
take latitude and longitude and return a human-readable name,
<a href="https://www.geoapify.com/reverse-geocoding-api/">are also
available</a>, and might be useful — but they tend to cost money, and
the API call to ChatGPT is already an expense.
</p>
<p>
More refinements are possible, of course. Most crucially, it would be
helpful to know if a given restaurant is actually open; on a road trip,
it would also be very useful to find restaurants that are close to the
freeway. I wouldn’t mind seeing a top 3 or top 5 list with the relative
merits of each one. And being able to plan a trip around
toddler-friendly eating spots in advance would be gold.
</p>
<p>
What’s sort of neat about the technology is that this is all actually
very feasible — <em>in an hour or two</em>. Using AI as an engine in
this way cuts out a lot of development time, not to mention the need to
gather your own database. There are obviously ethical issues related to
how these models were trained, which are sure to be litigated for years
to come. But here we’re not creating any new content or replacing an
artist: we’re making it easier to find our way to a local business.
</p>
<p>
The next time I’m on a road trip with my little one and I see that he’s
starting to get hungry, I’ll be able to hit a button on my phone and get
directions to a nearby place that will probably be appropriate for him
to sit down and eat at. I think that’s cool.

snapshots for peace of mind</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: OS News</p>
<p>One feature I couldn’t live without anymore is snapshots. As system
administrators, we often find ourselves in situations where we’ve made a
mistake, need to revert to a previous state, or need access to a log
that has been rotated and disappeared. Since I started using ZFS, all of
this has become incredibly simple, and I feel much more at ease when
making any modifications. However, since I don’t always remember to
create a manual snapshot before starting to work, I use an automatic
snapshot system. For this type of snapshot, I use
the excellent zfs-autobackup tool – which I also use for backups. The
goal is to have a single, flexible, and configurable tool without having
to learn different syntaxes. ↫ Stefano Marinelli I’m always a little sad
about the fact that the kind of advanced features modern file systems
like ZFS, btrfs, and others offer are so inaccessible to mere desktop
users like myself. While I understand they’re primarily designed for
server use, they’re still making their way to desktops – my Fedora
installations all default to btrfs – and I’d love to be able to make use
of their advanced features straight from within KDE (or GNOME or
whatever it is you use). Of course, that’s neither here or there for the
article at hand, which will be quite useful for people administering
FreeBSD and/or Linux systems, and who would like to get the most out of
ZFS by automating some of its functionality.</p>

The R2 is expected to enter production in 2026, but the company needs to
continue to expand its Normal operations first. The town council
approved a whole new “R2” building and more square footage overall. In
other Rivian news, the company’s vice president of manufacturing, Tim
Fallon, is leaving to join Stellantis. Fallon is the latest in a wave of
recent high-level departures for the company. “The exits highlight the
volatility at the EV startup as it navigates production hurdles and a
broader slowdown in demand for plug-in vehicles also afflicting its
rivals,”

id="white-house-downplays-chinese-concerns-over-possible-us-nuclear-strategy-change">White
House downplays Chinese concerns over possible US nuclear strategy
change</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Seoul, South Korea — White House officials on Wednesday appeared to
downplay Beijing’s sentiment that it is “seriously concerned” after a
report alleged the United States recently approved a secret plan to
shift some of the focus of its nuclear strategy away from Russia to deal
with Beijing’s nuclear weapons buildup.   </p>
<p>“The guidance issued earlier this year is not a response to any
single entity, country, nor threat,” National Security Council Spokesman
Sean Savett told VOA in response to emailed questions. “We have
repeatedly voiced concerns about the advancing nuclear arsenals of
Russia, [China] and [North Korea].” </p>
<p>“The most recent guidance builds on what was issued by previous
administrations — there is far more continuity than change,” he
said. </p>
<p>Savett did not provide details of the new strategy but noted that
“while the specific text of the guidance is classified, its existence is
in no way secret.”</p>
<p>Late Tuesday, The New York Times reported that U.S. President Joe
Biden in March approved a new “nuclear employment guidance,” a highly
classified document outlining how the U.S. would use nuclear weapons in
a potential conflict.</p>
<p>The report said the document, updated every four years, reorients
U.S. nuclear deterrent strategy to deal with China’s massive expansion
of its nuclear arsenal. The document also orders U.S. forces to prepare
for the possibility of “coordinated nuclear challenges” from China,
Russia, and North Korea, according to the report.</p>
<p>Asked about the report during a press briefing Wednesday, a Chinese
foreign ministry spokesperson accused the United States of “peddling the
China nuclear threat narrative” and “finding excuses to seek strategic
advantage.”</p>
<p>“China is seriously concerned about the relevant report, and the
facts have fully proven that the United States has constantly stirred up
the so-called China nuclear threat theory in recent years,” said Chinese
foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning.</p>
<p>Russia has not responded to the report.</p>
<p>For decades, U.S. nuclear policy has been primarily focused on
Russia, the only other country with comparable nuclear weapons
capabilities.</p>
<p>However, U.S. officials have increasingly warned that China’s nuclear
buildup under President Xi Jinping is proceeding faster than previously
expected.</p>
<p>In an unclassified document released late last year, the Pentagon
estimated that the Chinese military had more than 500 operational
warheads in its arsenal and will have more than 1,000 warheads by
2030.</p>
<p>That compares to the United States, which possesses a nuclear
stockpile of about 3,700 active warheads, according to estimates
compiled by the U.S.-based Arms Control Association.</p>
<p>Russia has roughly 4,380 nuclear warheads, including about 1,550 on
strategic delivery systems, according to estimates cited by the
group.</p>
<p>Given those numbers, Russia remains the “major driver” behind U.S.
nuclear strategy, said Daryl G. Kimball, the director of the Arms
Control Association, in a post on social media site X.</p>
<p>The Times report overstates the changes outlined in the U.S. nuclear
weapons guidance document, according to Kimball, who insisted there has
been no reorientation away from Russia toward China.</p>
<p>“Despite China’s nuclear expansion, Russia’s arsenal significantly
exceeds that of China’s - even after Xi’s ambitious plan is complete.
Until that changes, focus will remain on Russia’s arsenal,” said Hans
Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the
Federation of American Scientists.</p>
<p>“But planning against China is increasing, as reflected in the
document,” Kristensen added in a post on X.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have publicly referred to the nuclear weapons document
at least twice, without offering much detail on its contents.</p>
<p>In June, Pranay Vaddi, the White House National Security Council’s
senior director for arms control and nonproliferation, said the new
guidance “emphasizes the need to account for the growth and diversity”
of China’s nuclear arsenal, as well the need to deter Russia, China, and
North Korea simultaneously.</p>
<p>According to Vaddi, the U.S. will continue to pursue nuclear arms
restraints with Russia and China, but “without a change in the
trajectory that Russia, [China], and North Korea are on,” the U.S. “will
need to continue to adjust our posture and capabilities to ensure our
ability to deter and meet other objectives going forward.”</p>
<p>Vipin Narang, an MIT nuclear security specialist who until recently
focused on nuclear policy in the Pentagon, said earlier this month that
Biden “recently issued updated nuclear weapons employment guidance to
account for multiple nuclear-armed adversaries, and, in particular, the
significant increase in the size and diversity of [China’s] nuclear
arsenal.”</p>
<p>“It is our responsibility to see the world as it is, not as we hoped
or wished it would be,” said Narang. “It is possible that we will one
day look back and see the quarter century after the Cold War as ‘nuclear
intermission’.”</p>
<p>U.S. and Chinese officials both frequently speak of the dangers of
nuclear war, but efforts to hold dialogue on the issue have failed.</p>
<p>Last year, U.S. and Chinese officials agreed to negotiations on
nuclear non-proliferation and arms control, ahead of a meeting between
Biden and Xi. But China suspended the talks last month, citing U.S. arms
sales to the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its
own.</p>
<p>Many analysts are also concerned about growing military and
diplomatic cooperation between Russia and China. In 2022, Xi and Russian
President Vladimir Putin agreed on a “no-limits” partnership and have
recently expanded joint military exercises and other cooperation.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Russia also restored a Cold War-era mutual defense
treaty with nuclear-armed North Korea and hinted at further defense
cooperation.</p>
<p>Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin has repeatedly issued thinly
veiled threats about using nuclear weapons against Western-backed forces
there.</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
Democrats are gathering in Chicago this week for their quadrennial
convention and to celebrate Kamala Harris’s nomination for president.
This year’s convention will look different from 2020’s for many reasons
— but one of them is that we’re likely to hear far less about climate
change. Unlike in 2020, when President Joe Biden described global
warming as one of “four overlapping crises” confronting the country,
Harris has been more subtle when discussing it.
</p>
<p>
So … is that a problem? Should we be freaked out? On this week’s episode
of Shift Key, Rob and Jesse discuss the modern electoral politics of
climate change. We talk about whether the electorate’s interest in
climate issues has faded, how the Inflation Reduction Act could affect
voting, and why a “quiet on climate” strategy might be okay. Shift Key
is hosted by Robinson Meyer, the founding executive editor of Heatmap,
and Jesse Jenkins, a professor of energy systems engineering at
Princeton University.

Here is an excerpt from our conversation:
</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Jesse Jenkins: </strong>The other thing that I think is really
fascinating — and I’ve felt like this is a case that a political
scientist could certainly have more to say about — but it feels like
this is a case that the focus on climate in the 117th Congress, the
Congress that passed the infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction
Act, was, I think, largely elite-driven. Like inside-the-Beltway
priority-setting, not so much a general response to polling, even though
you’re right, there was an energy crisis that actually happened towards
the tail end of that legislative debate. <br/> <br/> And the original
agenda was the Build Back Better agenda from the Biden administration,
which is really trying to center these investments in new economies, new
industries — including clean energy — as part of a broader post-COVID
economic recovery. <br/> <br/> What was fascinating to me is that, you
know, the Build Back Better Act was really a cost of living-focused
bill. It had a huge amount of programs focused on the cost of childcare,
on elder care, on healthcare. And all of that got stripped out as the
bill moved on and eventually became the Inflation Reduction Act, which
primarily centered around climate and clean energy investment with a
small residual piece around prescription drugs and extending Affordable
Care Act subsidies for lower middle class folks that rely on the
insurance exchanges. Most of the stuff that would now, I think, be
hugely popular in this electoral cycle because it much more centrally
spoke to the concerns about cost of living got pulled out at the behest
of folks like Joe Manchin, who wanted to strip the bill down and not
focus on expanding social programs. <br/> <br/> So it’s kind of an
interesting dynamic. If I were to look at polls and use those polls to
have predicted which pieces would fall out of the bill as the Build Back
Better Act moved through the hand to hand combat of congressional
passage, I would have expected it would have been climate because it’s
always low on the priority list when you look at polling, but it was
actually the exact opposite. <br/> <br/> I think there was a sense in
the halls of Congress that climate was the one thing you couldn’t
jettison because that was their one chance to take a shot at it. And
they didn’t know when they would get another shot. <br/> <br/>
<strong>Robinson Meyer: </strong>I want to moderate that — or I want to
disagree slightly on a few things. I totally agree, first of all, that
climate acted in the IRA negotiations primarily as an elite-driven
issue. And I think that is often ignored in conversations about the IRA,
and I think it is actually quite important to hit home that point
because it should lead to better decision-making in the future — both as
people who want to see the federal government continue to push on
decarbonization and also people interested in political actors making
smart choices and decisions around decarbonization.<br/> <br/> It is
true that a lot of that so-called care-focused policy in the IRA, I
think it fell out for two reasons. The first is that Democrats thought
that they were going to be able to get a better deal from Manchin.
Manchin agreed to terms in October 2021, he agreed to a set of terms
that Democrats kind of then just blew past. They thought that basically
by bullying him, by ignoring his demands, he was going to give way and
allow a larger bill, and he ultimately did not. <br/> <br/> But No. 2, I
guess I would add that the other place where the care economy stuff got
really hit was that some of the policy design seemed pretty bad. There
were white papers that came out or blog posts that came out during the
October 2021 to March 2022 period that suggested that there were going
to be real unintended consequences, especially around the childcare
policy, that had not been seriously looked at. And while I don’t think
those blog posts or analysis played a decisive role, I do think that — I
remember Matt Bruenig wrote
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/democratic-childcare-proposal-hurts-families/620749/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
big piece here</u></a> — I do think that that led to Democrats being
more willing to jettison the policy because they felt like that policy
had emerged from kind of a morass of foundation-funded nonprofits and
maybe hadn’t gotten the close inspection that it needed —<br/> <br/>
<strong>Jenkins: </strong>It wasn’t quite ready for …<br/> <br/>
<strong>Meyer: </strong>It wasn’t quite ready for primetime, and in a
different way than the energy tax credits in the IRA were ready for
primetime — because to some degree, they were a giant expansion on
policy that Congress had already done for a while, right? And obviously
there were new tax credits, too. But there was an existing economic
record that Congress could subsidize clean via the tax code and not
create massive, massive unintended, distortionary effects in the economy
that did not exist for, say, childcare.

id="dncs-day-2-double-dose-of-obama-firepower-a-doting-spouse-and-a-dance-party">DNC’s
Day 2: Double dose of Obama firepower, a doting spouse and a dance
party</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — The Democratic National Convention’s second night showcased
a double dose of Obama firepower to validate Vice President Kamala
Harris and deliver an unsparing indictment of Republican Donald Trump.
The convention also served up a raucous roll call of states that was
essentially one big dance party.</p>
<p>Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, ducked out of
Chicago to hold a rally just up the interstate in Milwaukee, wooing
voters in battleground Wisconsin. It was a recognition that, regardless
of whatever good vibes may exist at the convention, Democrats expect
this presidential election to be razor-close.</p>
<p>Here are some takeaways from the convention’s second night.</p>
<p>The ex-presidents club</p>
<p>If the Republican convention was all about Trump, the Democrats on
Tuesday wanted to put Harris in a pantheon with past presidents.</p>
<p>The biggest validators of the night were former President Barack
Obama and his wife, Michelle. The latter linked Harris with her husband
by telling the rapt crowd, “America, hope is making a comeback.”</p>
<p>Barack Obama, for his part, reached back to his own 2004 convention
speech to tie Harris to his legacy. “I am feeling hopeful – because this
convention has always been pretty good to kids with funny names who
believe in a country where everything is possible,” he said.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the Obamas making the case for the vice president. The
grandsons of Jimmy Carter and John F. Kennedy also portrayed her as the
natural heir of past Democratic leaders.</p>
<p>As groundbreaking as Harris’ candidacy is as the first woman of color
to be her party’s nominee, these speeches by an ex-president and
presidential progeny were all about linking her to a broader historical
arc and evoking the excitement of Obama’s 2008 run that Harris hopes to
replicate.</p>
<p>Diverting from the high road</p>
<p>The Obamas did not hold back in lacing into Trump. Michelle Obama’s
well-worn adage from years past that “when they go low, we go high” no
longer seemed operative.</p>
<p>Barack Obama called Trump “a 78-year-old billionaire who hasn’t
stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden
escalator nine years ago.”</p>
<p>Michelle Obama also took a personal swipe, saying: “For years, Donald
Trump did everything in his power to try to make people fear us. His
limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by the
existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who
also happened to be Black.”</p>
<p>Playing off her famous line about Republicans going low, Michelle
Obama suggested that Trump was going “small” and that “it’s unhealthy,
and quite frankly, it’s unpresidential.”</p>
<p>DNC dance party</p>
<p>Political conventions technically happen so that delegates can
nominate presidential and vice presidential candidates.</p>
<p>This year, the Democrats took care of that job in advance. But that
didn’t stop them from holding a ceremonial do-over and turning it into a
raucous dance party.</p>
<p>DJ Cassidy strode on stage in a bright blue double-breasted suit and
spun tunes for every state as they nominated Harris and Walz. Minnesota
got “1999” by native son Prince, Kansas got “Carry on Wayward Son” by,
well, Kansas. “Born in the U.S.A.” by Bruce Springsteen played as New
Jersey weighed in.</p>
<p>Usually it was governors or state party chairs calling out the votes,
but some states passed the mic to make serious points. Kate Cox, who
unsuccessfully sued her home state of Texas while seeking an abortion
for a non-viable fetus, announced Texas’ votes. A survivor of the 2017
Las Vegas strip gun massacre announced Nevada’s votes.</p>
<p>The roll call highlight was when Atlanta rapper Lil Jon strode
through the United Center to the beats of “Turn Down for What,” his song
with DJ Snake, and rapped his support for Harris and Walz.</p>
<p>Democrats are eager to highlight how Harris’ ascension has energized
the party. The roll call fit that vibe.</p>
<p>America’s blind date with Doug Emhoff</p>
<p>Doug Emhoff wants America to love his wife as much as he does.</p>
<p>His convention speech Tuesday night focused on their love story and
offered a personal glimpse meant to pull in voters, too. He dished on
the deets of their first phone call, after he left her a rambling
voicemail that she still makes him listen to every year on their
anniversary.</p>
<p>“I love that laugh,” he said adoringly, a rebuttal to Trump’s
criticism of Harris’ laughter.</p>
<p>As Harris flew back to Chicago from Milwaukee after her rally there,
Air Force Two spent an extra 10 minutes in the air so she could watch
her husband speak, according to an aide.</p>
<p>Emhoff said he “just fell in love fast” with Harris, adding that she
finds “joy in pursuing justice” and “stands up to bullies.” It’s not how
most husbands describe their partners, but, then, Emhoff is trying to
convince voters that the woman he’s been married to for 10 years this
Thursday knows how to take on Trump.</p>
<p>A message for Republicans: It’s OK to quit Trump</p>
<p>The Democrats are making a play for disaffected Trump voters — and
they used one of his former White House staffers to make their case.</p>
<p>Stephanie Grisham worked in various roles in the Trump White House,
including communications director and press secretary, allowing
Democrats to argue that those who know Trump best have seen him at his
worst.</p>
<p>“He has no empathy, no morals, and no fidelity to the truth,” Grisham
said. “I couldn’t be part of the insanity any longer.”</p>
<p>Kyle Sweetser, a Trump voter from Alabama, told the convention the
former president’s tariffs made life harder for construction workers
like him. Republican Mayor John Giles of Mesa, Arizona, also spoke about
why he’s backing Harris. Giles sees Trump’s policies as hurting cities
like his.</p>

close DNC’s second night with rousing Harris endorsement</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — Warning of a difficult fight ahead, former President Barack
Obama and Michelle Obama on Tuesday called on the nation to embrace
Kamala Harris in urgent messages to the Democratic National Convention
that were at times both hopeful and foreboding.</p>
<p>“America, hope is making a comeback,” the former first lady declared.
She then tore into Republican Donald Trump, a sharp shift from the 2016
convention speech in which she told her party, “When they go low, we go
high.”</p>
<p>“His limited and narrow view of the world made him feel threatened by
the existence of two hardworking, highly educated, successful people who
also happened to be Black,” Obama said of Trump.</p>
<p>Her husband, the nation’s first Black president pushing for America
to elect its second, called Trump “a 78-year-old billionaire who hasn’t
stopped whining about his problems since he rode down his golden
escalator nine years ago.”</p>
<p>“It’s been a constant stream of gripes and grievances that’s actually
gotten worse now that he’s afraid of losing to Kamala,” he charged.</p>
<p>The fiery messages from two of the Democratic Party’s biggest stars
underscored the urgency of the moment as Harris works to stitch together
a broad coalition in her bid to defeat Trump this fall. She is drawing
on stars like the Obamas and other celebrities, officials from the far
left to the middle, and even some Republicans to boost her campaign.</p>
<p>And while the theme of the night was “a bold vision for America’s
future,” the disparate factions of Harris’ evolving coalition
demonstrated, above all, that they are connected by a deep desire to
prevent a second Trump presidency.</p>
<p>Just ahead of the Obamas’ remarks, Harris addressed an estimated
15,000 people in battleground Wisconsin in the arena where Republicans
held their convention last month. She declared that she was running “a
people-powered campaign.”</p>
<p>“Together we will chart a new way forward,” the vice president said
in remarks that were partially broadcast to the DNC. “A future for
freedom, opportunity, of optimism and faith.”</p>
<p>Back in Chicago, Senators Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic
leader, and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent beloved by
progressives, both praised Harris. And in an appearance perhaps intended
to needle Trump, his former press secretary Stephanie Grisham — now a
harsh critic of her former boss — also took the convention stage.</p>
<p>Trump “has no empathy, no morals and no fidelity to the truth,”
Grisham said. “I love my country more than my party. Kamala Harris tells
the truth. She respects the American people. And she has my vote.”</p>
<p>Still, it was not all serious on the second night of the four-day
convention.</p>
<p>A symbolic roll call in which delegates from each state pledged their
support for the Democratic nominee turned into a party atmosphere. A DJ
played a mix of state-specific songs — and Atlanta native Lil Jon ran
out during Georgia’s turn to his hit song with DJ Snake, “Turn Down for
What,” to the delight of the thousands inside the cavernous United
Center.</p>
<p>Second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who will become the nation’s first
gentleman if his wife wins the presidency, shared personal details about
his relationship with Harris — their cooking habits, their first date
and her laugh, which is often mocked by Republican critics.</p>
<p>“You know that laugh. I love that laugh!” Emhoff said as the crowd
cheered. Later, he added, “Her empathy is her strength.”</p>
<p>Trump, meanwhile, was out on the campaign trail as part of his
weeklong swing-state tour during the Democratic convention. He went to
Howell, Michigan, on Tuesday and stood aside sheriff’s deputies as he
labeled Harris the “ringleader” of a “Marxist attack on law enforcement”
across the country.</p>
<p>“Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death,”
Trump said in one of many generalizations about an America under
Harris.</p>
<p>Harris, meanwhile, cast the election in dire, almost existential
terms. She implored Americans not to get complacent in light of the
Supreme Court decision carving out broad presidential immunity, a power
she said Trump would abuse.</p>
<p>She has also seized on Trump’s opposition to a nationally guaranteed
right to abortion.</p>
<p>“They seemingly don’t trust women,” she said of Trump and his
Republican allies. “Well, we trust women.”</p>
<p>The vice president’s speech evoked some of the same themes that
underlaid Biden’s case for reelection before he dropped out, casting
Trump as a threat to democracy. Harris argued that Trump threatens the
values and freedoms that Americans hold dear.</p>
<p>Someone with that record “should never again have the opportunity to
stand behind the seal of the president of the United States,” Harris
said. “Never again.”</p>

id="protesters-arrested-after-clash-with-police-outside-chicagos-israeli-consulate">Protesters
arrested after clash with police outside Chicago’s Israeli
consulate</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>CHICAGO — Dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters charged a line of
police in an intense standoff with hundreds of officers outside the
Israeli consulate Tuesday on the second night of the Democratic National
Convention.</p>
<p>After the larger gathering began to disperse, splintering off into
smaller groups, other interactions with police led to more than a dozen
arrests. Officers called the demonstrations “an unlawful assembly.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the night, officers carrying wooden clubs shouted “move”
and penned the demonstrators in on the street, preventing them from
marching.</p>
<p>Some demonstrators set an American flag on fire in the street as the
celebratory roll call for Vice President Kamala Harris took place inside
the United Center about 3.2 kilometers away. Others carried Palestinian
flags, while many others wore black and covered their faces.</p>
<p>As protesters regrouped and approached a line of police in riot gear
in front of a Chicago skyscraper that houses the Israeli consulate, an
officer said into a megaphone, “You are ordered to immediately
disburse.” A woman in the front of the march shouted back with her own
megaphone: “We’re not scared of you.”</p>
<p>A man in a Chicago Bulls hat, his face covered by a balaclava, called
on protesters to “shut down the DNC.” The group, which is not affiliated
with the coalition of over 200 groups that organized Monday’s protests,
advertised the demonstration Tuesday under the slogan of “Make it great
like ’68,” invoking the anti-Vietnam War protests that seized the city
during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.</p>
<p>The atmosphere with rows of police in riot gear was a stark contrast
to a day earlier when thousands of pro-Palestinian activists, including
families pushing babies in strollers, marched near the convention site
calling for a cease-fire.</p>
<p>Police kept protesters confined to a block of Madison Street, a
normally bustling downtown thoroughfare where traffic was halted on both
ends Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Law enforcement had closed down most of the entrances to the building
on Tuesday, allowing commuters to come in only one entrance where armed
officers were also posted. Many of the building’s shops were closed.
Martha Hill, a spokeswoman for the Metra commuter rail service, said
train service was running as normal.</p>
<p>The consulate has been the site of numerous demonstrations since the
war in Gaza began in October. It is in a building connected to the
Ogilvie Transportation Center, a major commuter rail station.</p>
<p>Mohammed Ismail, a 29-year-old psychiatry resident who lives in
Chicago, described the police presence as “excessive,” and questioned
why the group had been blocked from marching. He said he joined the
protest to urge Democrats to cease funding to Israel.</p>
<p>“It’s not right that we’re sending our tax money to fund an ongoing
slaughter, an ongoing genocide,” Ismail said. “We’re a part of this
conflict because our money is paying for it.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the sites of demonstrations from the previous night were
largely quiet. Thirteen people were arrested during Monday’s protests,
most them related to a “brief breach” of security fencing “within sight
and sound of the United Center,” the city’s police superintendent
said.</p>
<p>Israel supporters, including some relatives of people kidnapped by
Hamas, gathered earlier in the day at a pro-Israel art installation not
far from the consulate to call on U.S. leaders to continue backing
Israel and pushing for the release of hostages. The art installation
included giant milk cartons bearing photos of some of the hostages.</p>
<p>Elan Carr, CEO of the Israeli-American Council, condemned the
pro-Palestinian protesters who have descended on Chicago this week,
calling them “fringe crazies” and demanding that U.S. leaders “stand
unequivocally with the state of Israel.”</p>
<p>More protests were planned throughout the week. However, attendance
at the main rally on Monday was far below estimates of organizers who
had predicted more than 20,000 would show up.</p>
<p>Chicago Police Superintendent Larry Snelling said Tuesday that the
crowd was around 3,500 strong and that the vast majority of the
protesters were peaceful.</p>
<p>However, some clashed with police, used pepper spray against them and
threw water bottles at officers during the clash in the park where there
was a breach in security fencing, Snelling said. He said officers did
not use any chemical sprays.</p>
<p>“Our officers showed great restraint,” he said at a news conference.
“We’re not going to tolerate vandalism and violence in our city. … We’re
going to continue to protect the city.”</p>
<p>Snelling said with more protests planned, his department is prepared
to de-escalate situations whenever possible.</p>
<p>“Again, we’re up to the challenge,” Snelling said. “The city is up to
the challenge.”</p>
<p>The park where the most arrests were made, located a block from the
convention arena, served as a destination point for a march of thousands
calling for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war. Several dozen
activists broke off from the main group, breached the fencing, and were
pushed back by police.</p>
<p>Authorities said the inner security perimeter surrounding the United
Center was not breached and there was no threat to those attending the
convention.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, an extra line of fencing was installed at the
park and the tall metal barriers were reinforced to prevent protesters
from lifting and removing the panels. No police officers or protesters
were in the park early Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 13 people arrested during Monday’s protest were detained on
charges ranging from criminal trespass and resisting and obstructing an
arrest, to aggravated battery of police officers, Snelling said.</p>
<p>At least 10 of them were arrested in connection with the fence, he
said.</p>
<p>Snelling said he did not connect those who tore down the fence with
the entirety of the march. He said the vast majority of participants
were peaceful, and he praised his officers’ conduct in the moment.</p>
<p>The Chicago chapter of the National Lawyers Guild said two of the
people arrested were hospitalized. Snelling said they were not taken to
the hospital for injuries, but “so they could be provided the treatment
they needed when it came to their medications.”</p>
<p>Two people were also arrested on misdemeanor property damage and
resisting arrest charges during a protest march Sunday night. As of
Tuesday morning, 15 people had been arrested.</p>
<p>Most of the largest demonstrations have been organized by the
Coalition to March on the DNC, which has focused on calling for a
cease-fire in Gaza. But smaller protests have popped up around the city,
during the convention’s welcome party at Navy Pier.</p>

id="political-criticism-and-controversy-swirls-ahead-of-china-video-game-release">Political
criticism and controversy swirls ahead of China video game release</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington —  The release of a Chinese video game touted as the
country’s first to meet Triple-A standards, has sparked a flurry of
online criticism of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Video games are given a AAA label when they are backed by big funds,
highly developed and distributed by well-known publishers.</p>
<p>The Aug. 20 worldwide release of the Chinese game Black Myth: Wukong
has been anticipated since its demo got more than 56 million views on
the Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili in 2020.</p>
<p>On YouTube, which is banned in China, the game demo had more than 10
million views.</p>
<p>Developed by China-based Game Science, the game has players take on
the role of the Monkey King, a character from the Chinese classic novel
Journey to the West, and defeat monsters wreaking havoc on the
world.</p>
<p>Although the game has no direct connection to politics, Chinese
commenters took to a U.S.–based gaming discussion board ahead of the
release to criticize the Chinese government and President Xi Jinping.
 </p>
<p>The discussion board on Steam, a Washington state-based online gaming
platform, was hit with a slew of comments in Chinese last week that
directly and indirectly criticized Chinese authorities and Xi.  </p>
<p>One mocked Xi’s unprecedented third term as leader, saying, “I will
continue to be Jade Emperor in Black Myth: Wukong. Raise your hands if
you oppose it.”</p>
<p>Most critical posts ranted against the Chinese government, in ways
unrelated to the game.</p>
<p>“Overthrow the Communist Party of China and establish a democratic
constitutional system where everyone has a vote,” read what appeared to
be the first critical comment.  </p>
<p>“Thank you to the party, thank you to our great chief accelerator, Xi
Jinping,” another comment reads, mocking Xi’s policies as accelerating
China’s economic decline.</p>
<p>Another post listed the timeline of the weeks-long 1989 Tiananmen
Square pro-democracy protests and the subsequent violent crackdown that
occurred when Chinese troops used lethal force against student-led
demonstrators, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands.</p>
<p>Such critical comments of China’s government and leaders are not
allowed on China’s internet, where an army of censors frequently scrubs
websites and discussion boards of comments that do not follow the
Chinese Communist Party’s line.  </p>
<p>Observers were surprised to find by the afternoon of Aug. 16, many of
the critical posts on Steam’s U.S. discussion board had similarly been
removed.  </p>
<p>Li Ying, a Chinese social media influencer and government critic
known online as Teacher Li, posted his opposition to the removal on
Aug. 14 on X with screenshots of the original posts.</p>
<p>“Steam is inherently a free platform, with a wide variety of games
here, and players are free to express any opinions and opinions about
the game,” he wrote on X.</p>
<p>Steam’s China-based website does not have a discussion board, and the
U.S.-based discussion board is only available to users outside China.
Those inside China need to use a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which
helps users bypass controls to access internet content outside the
country that is blocked.</p>
<p>VOA reached out to Steam seeking comment about why the posts were
deleted but did not receive a reply. Steam’s discussion board rules do
not explicitly prohibit political posts but say that users are not
allowed to post “disrespectful” content and to avoid posting content
unrelated to the topic.</p>
<p>While the game is not directly connected to the Chinese government,
it did receive some official help and praise. The city government of
Hangzhou, where Game Science is located, gave the game a grant in 2022.
State media in the province, Zhejiang, described the game as “one of the
most important explorers in the history of AAA games in China – an
explorer that deserves applause and encouragement.”</p>
<p>It’s not the first time Black Myth: Wukong has stirred up some
controversy.</p>
<p>The game’s developers have been accused of making lewd and sexist
remarks.</p>
<p>Feng Ji, the founder and CEO of Game Science, in a Weibo post last
year lamenting the difficulties in development, used words with erotic
connotations and compared his desire for expanding development to oral
sex.</p>
<p>Yang Qi, the game’s artistic director, remarked as early as 2013 on
Weibo that they would not pander to female players in the game’s
production.</p>
<p>“I don’t need the reverse drive of female players. I don’t take care
of those lewd insects who come to pick up girls; some things are made
for pure men,” he wrote.</p>
<p>In response, a female influencer posted on the gender-focused WeChat
account Orange Umbrella, urging Game Science to respect female
gamers.</p>
<p>“As a fellow player, I know how much hard work and dedication it
takes to make a game, and Black Myth: Wukong’s dedication and
seriousness in the production are commendable,” she wrote. “However,
don’t let the backward gender consciousness push players who are also
full of expectations for the game in the opposite direction more and
more.”</p>
<p>When Western media, including IGN, one of the most influential U.S.
online news sites for video games, reported last year on the
controversial comments, nationalist Chinese commenters called the
coverage an attempt to impose western values and put down China’s gaming
industry.</p>
<p>“Judging the Chinese game with the politically correct stance of the
West is really biased for the media,” a review article reads. The
article said whether the developers’ remarks constituted sexism “depends
on the perspective.”</p>
<p>On Weibo, one commenter called IGN a “clown” and wrote, “In order to
suppress the rise of Chinese games, the gender card is unsurprisingly
played again.”</p>
<p>Despite the controversies, gaming industry experts expect Black Myth:
Wukong to be a big hit.</p>
<p>Daniel Camilo, a game industry consultant based in southern China’s
Shenzhen city, noted to VOA that sexism in the gaming industry is not
new and has little impact on commercial success.</p>
<p>“Hardcore gamers and fans that actively discuss these issues and are
aware of them usually represent a very small [loud] minority online that
accounts for a small residual amount of those who actually buy games,”
he said.</p>
<p>The game has already received high praise from reviewers in China and
abroad.</p>
<p>IGN gave the game an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10 on Aug. 16, calling it a
“great action game with great fights and exciting and powerful
opponents, albeit with a few bugs.”</p>
<p>The Chinese version of IGN gave the game a perfect score of 10,
writing, “This is a truly competitive domestic game in the global
market, and I believe it will be a strong contender for this year’s Game
of the Year.”</p>
<p>Camilo noted the high quality of the homegrown game has given Chinese
players something to be proud of that might even help improve China’s
international image.</p>
<p>“Black Myth will change perceptions people have regarding Chinese
games and, to some extent, China and its cultural output and soft power
really,” he said.</p>

“Back in the fall, I wrote about a research project I was diving into
with Darius Kazemi. Now, after a few months of prepping and conducting
interviews with people who run Mastodon and Hometown servers about how
they govern their parts of the network and then many more months of
analyzing and writing up what we found, we’re releasing our findings. We
found so much.”

<p>
This is <a href="https://fediverse-governance.github.io/">an
impressively in-depth report</a> by Erin Kissane and Darius Kazemi,
which has some important conclusions about how moderation can work in a
federated system (including the not-insignificant conclusion that it
<em>can</em> work). There’s room for more tooling, and better
communication between instances - but this is all doable stuff.

Society Foundations</a>]
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“In February 2024, the Open Society Foundations issued a call for
applications for a convening in which selected participants would share
their visions of an AI-mediated future.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I thought this, from the concluding observations, was telling:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Participants were generally reluctant or unable to articulate exactly
how AI might transform the information ecosystem. […] Relatively few
submitted scenarios described an AI-driven transformation in specific
detail, and it was clear that many participants who were convinced that
AI would fundamentally restructure the information ecosystem also had no
specific point of view on how that might occur.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In other words, while many people in journalism see that this set of
technologies may transform their industry, and are potentially excited
or terrified that it will, they have no idea how that will happen. This
is the very definition of hype: one can imagine people proclaiming that
blockchain, or push notifications, or RealMedia, or WebTV might do the
same.
</p>
<p>
It’s not that there are no uses for AI (just like it’s not that there
are no uses for blockchain). It will find its way into end-user
applications, underpin newsroom tools, and power data-driven newsroom
investigations, without a doubt. But the hype far exceeds that, and will
eventually, inevitably, deflate.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, journalists are not as worried about the technologies
themselves as who controls them:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“Throughout the application process and workshop discussions, it became
clear that much of the conversation was not actually about AI, nor about
journalism, nor about the current or future information ecosystem, but
instead about power. It was clear that power, and the potential for
transfers of power from one group to another, was the explicit or
implicit subject of many of the submitted scenarios as well as the five
final scenarios that were distilled from the workshop.”
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Technologists, in turn, were blind to these power dynamics, while
simultaneously predicting more dramatic changes. There’s a fundamental
truth here: it’s ultimately about money, and who controls the platforms
that allow readers to read about the world around them.
</p>
<p>
Same as it ever was: that’s been the struggle on the web since its
inception. AI just shifts the discussion to a new set of platforms.

says classified nuclear strategy not response to single country,
threat</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — A classified nuclear strategic plan approved by
President Joe Biden this year is not a response to a single country or
threat, the White House said on Tuesday, after the New York Times
reported it reoriented the U.S. deterrence strategy to focus on China’s
expansion of its nuclear arsenal for the first time.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based Arms Control Association said it understood U.S.
nuclear weapons strategy and posture remained the same as described in
the administration’s 2022 Nuclear Posture Review, and there had been no
reorientation away from Russia and toward China.</p>
<p>The New York Times said the White House never announced that Biden
approved the revised strategy, titled the “Nuclear Employment Guidance,”
but an unclassified notification to Congress of the revision is expected
to be sent before Biden leaves office.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that in recent speeches, two senior administration
officials were allowed to allude to the strategy revision. It said the
strategy is updated every four years or so.</p>
<p>Asked about the report, White House spokesperson Sean Savett said:
“This administration, like the four administrations before it, issued a
Nuclear Posture Review and Nuclear Weapons Employment Planning
Guidance.</p>
<p>“While the specific text of the Guidance is classified, its existence
is in no way secret. The Guidance issued earlier this year is not a
response to any single entity, country, nor threat.”</p>
<p>Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association,
said that while U.S. intelligence estimates suggest China may increase
the size its nuclear arsenal from 500 to 1,000 warheads by 2030, Russia
has about 4,000 nuclear warheads “and it remains the major driver behind
U.S. nuclear strategy.”</p>
<p>Kimball cited June remarks by one of the officials referred to in the
Times report, White House Senior Director for Arms Control, Disarmament,
and Nonproliferation Pranay Vaddi.</p>
<p>According to those remarks, U.S. strategy was to pursue nuclear arms
restraints with China and Russia, but if China continued on its current
trajectory and if Russia exceeds New START limits, the U.S. at some
point in the future may need to consider adjustments to the size and
makeup of its nuclear force, Kimball said.</p>
<p>“My understanding is that the point at which the current
administration thinks it might want to consider such changes won’t come
until 2030, or some time after,” he said.</p>

id="trump-campaigns-in-michigan-with-make-america-safe-again-speech">Trump
campaigns in Michigan with ‘Make America Safe Again’ speech</h2>
<p>date: 2024-08-21, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>HOWELL, Michigan — Former President Donald Trump pledged Tuesday to
“Make America Safe Again” while campaigning in Michigan as Democrats
gathered in Chicago to nominate Kamala Harris. </p>
<p>As part of a battleground campaign swing designed to counter the
Democratic National Convention, Trump stood alongside sheriff’s deputies
in the city of Howell and tarred Harris, a former San Francisco district
attorney and California attorney general, as the “ringleader” of a
“Marxist attack on law enforcement” across the country. </p>
<p>“Kamala Harris will deliver crime, chaos, destruction and death,”
Trump said in one of many generalizations about an America under Harris.
“You’ll see levels of crime that you’ve never seen before. … I will
deliver law, order, safety and peace.” </p>
<p>Trump has sought in recent weeks to blunt the enthusiasm that Harris
has attracted since President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign
and endorsed her. That has involved both dark predictions about what
electing Harris would mean for the country and efforts by Trump’s
advisers to set up events where he can try to draw specific policy
contrasts. On Tuesday in Michigan, the subject was crime and public
safety. </p>
<p>In excerpts released before his speech, Trump’s campaign also said he
would call for the death penalty for child rapists and child
traffickers; he did not mention that during his remarks. </p>
<p>The event was the latest billed as focused on a specific issue. But
on these occasions, Trump has spent considerable time attacking Harris
personally and taking shots at Biden, and the same was true after their
appearances Monday at the Democratic convention. </p>
<p>“I watched last night in amazement as they tried to pretend
everything was great,” Trump said, singling out inflation and the
U.S.-Mexico border as topics Democrats glossed over. “We have a fool as
president,” he said of Biden. </p>
<p>Trump presented a bleak portrait of life in the U.S. and the threat
of a Harris presidency, though he was short on specifics and heavy on
hyperbole. </p>
<p>“It’s just insane,” Trump said. “You can’t walk across the street to
get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you
get whatever it may be. And you’ve seen it, and I’ve seen it, and it’s
time for a change.” </p>
<p>Trump making such claims, surrounded by supportive law enforcement
officers, stood in stark contrast to the Democrats’ convention. Speaker
after speaker found ways Monday night in Chicago to remind Americans
that Trump is the first former president ever convicted of felony
crimes, has been found civilly liable for sexual assault, and still
faces multiple indictments, including for his efforts to overturn his
2020 defeat to Biden. </p>
<p>Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas skewered Trump on Monday
night as “a career criminal, with 34 felonies, two impeachments and one
porn star,” a reference to his payments to an adult film actress at
issue in his New York conviction for business fraud. </p>
<p>The derision reached its peak as Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated
in 2016, stood back from the podium and smiled as delegates chanted:
“Lock him up! Lock him up!” — a turnabout from Trump supporters’ chants
about Clinton eight years ago despite the former secretary of state
never having been charged with any crime.</p>
