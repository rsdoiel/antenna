## 'Ready to come out?' Scientists emerge after year 'on Mars'

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

washington — The NASA astronaut knocks loudly three times on what appears to be a nondescript door and calls cheerfully: "You ready to come out?" 


The reply is inaudible, but beneath his mask he appears to be grinning as he yanks the door open, and four scientists who have spent a year away from all other human contact, simulating a mission to Mars, spill out to cheers and applause. 


Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell, Nathan Jones and team leader Kelly Haston have spent the past 378 days sealed inside the "Martian" habitat in Houston, Texas, part of NASA's research into what it will take to put humans on the Red Planet.  


They have been growing vegetables, conducting "Marswalks," and operating under what NASA terms "additional stressors," such as communication delays with "Earth," including their families; isolation and confinement.  


It's the kind of experience that would make anyone who lived through pandemic lockdowns shudder, but all four were beaming as they reemerged Saturday, their hair slightly more unruly and their emotion apparent.  


"Hello. It's actually so wonderful just to be able to say hello to you," Haston, a biologist, said with a laugh. 


"I really hope I don't cry standing up here in front of all of you," Jones, an emergency room doctor, said as he took to the microphone, and nearly doing just that several moments later as he spotted his wife in the crowd.  


The habitat, dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, is a 3D-printed, 160-square-meter facility, complete with bedrooms, a gym, common areas, and a vertical farm for growing food. 


An outdoor area, separated by an airlock, is filled with red sand and is where the team donned suits to conduct their "Marswalks," though it is still covered rather than being open air. 


"They have spent more than a year in this habitat conducting crucial science, most of it nutrition-based and how that impacts their performance ... as we prepare to send people on to the Red Planet," Steve Koerner told the crowd. Koerner is the deputy director at NASA's Johnson Space Center. 


"I'm very appreciative," he added. 


This mission is the first of a series of three planned by NASA, grouped under the title CHAPEA — Crew Health and Performance Exploration Analog. 


A yearlong mission simulating life on Mars took place in 2015-2016 in a habitat in Hawaii, and although NASA participated in it, it was not at the helm. 


Under its Artemis program, America plans to send humans back to the Moon to learn how to live there long-term to help prepare a trip to Mars, sometime towards the end of the 2030s.

## US records may shatter as excessive heat threatens 130 million

date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA

portland, oregon — Roughly 130 million people were under threat Saturday and into next week from a long-running heat wave that already has broken records with dangerously high temperatures — and is expected to shatter more from East Coast to West Coast, forecasters said. 


Oppressive heat and humidity could team up to spike temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38 degrees Celsius) in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, said Jacob Asherman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. 


In Oregon, records could be broken in cities including Eugene, Portland and Salem, Asherman said. Dozens of other records throughout the U.S. could fall, Asherman added, causing millions to seek relief from the blanket of heat in cooling centers from Bullhead City, Arizona, to Norfolk, Virginia. 


The National Weather Service said Saturday it was extending the excessive heat warning for much of the Southwest into Friday. 


"A dangerous and historic heatwave is just getting started across the area, with temperatures expected to peak during the Sunday-Wednesday timeframe," the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said in an updated forecast. 


Excessive heat will likely continue through Friday, the service said. 




In sweltering Las Vegas, where the temperature hit 100 F (37.7 C) by 10:30 a.m., Marko Boscovich said the best way to beat the heat is in a seat at a slot machine with a cold beer inside an air-conditioned casino. 


"But you know, after it hits triple digits it's about all the same to me," said Boscovich, who was visiting from Sparks, Nevada, to see a Dead & Company concert later Saturday night at the Sphere. "Maybe they'll play one of my favorites — 'Cold Rain and Snow.'" 


Heat records being shattered across the southwest 


By 10:30 a.m. Saturday, the National Weather Service said the temperature already had risen to 100 F (36.6 C) in Phoenix, which saw a record high of 118 F (47.7 C) for Friday. 


Meteorologists predict temperatures will be near daily records region-wide through most, if not all, of the coming week with lower desert highs reaching 115 to 120 F (46.1 to 48.8 C). 


Rare heat advisories had been extended even into the upper elevations, including around Lake Tahoe, with the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, warning of "major heat risk impacts, even in the mountains." 


"How hot are we talking? Well, high temperatures across (western Nevada and northeastern California) won't get below 100 degrees (37.8 C) until next weekend," the service posted online. "And unfortunately, there won't be much relief overnight either." 




A new heat record for the day was set Friday in California's Death Valley — one of the hottest places on Earth — with the mercury climbing to 127 F (52.8 C). The old mark of 122 F (50 C) was last tied in 2013. 


Palm Springs, California, hit 124 F (51.1 C) Friday, breaking the city's record of 123 F (50.5 C). 


More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including 129 F (53.8 degrees C) for Sunday at Furnace Creek in Death Valley National Park, and then around 130 (54.4 C) through Wednesday. The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 degrees (56.67 C) in Death Valley in July 1913, though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4 C) recorded there in July 2021. 


Worst is yet to come 


The worst was yet to come across much of the West, with triple-digit temperatures likely higher than average into next week, the National Weather Service said.  


The Eastern U.S. also was bracing for more hot temperatures. Baltimore and other parts of Maryland were under an excessive heat warning, as heat index values could climb to 110 F (43 C), forecasters said.


Heat-related deaths mounting 


In Arizona's Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with more than 160 other suspected heat deaths are still under investigation, according to the county's most recent report. 


That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy this week in Phoenix who suffered a "heat-related medical event" while hiking with family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police.

## Android 15 could include a desktop mode — but what for?

date: 2024-07-06, from: OS News

If there was ever a &#8220;will they, won&#8217;t they?&#8221; love story in mobile computing, it&#8217;s definitely Google&#8217;s on and off again relationship with Android&#8217;s desktop mode. There have been countless hints, efforts, and code pertaining to the mythical desktop mode for Android, but so far, Google has never flipped the switch and made it available. It&#8217;s 2024, Android 15 development is in full swing, and it seems Google and Android&#8217;s desktop mode are dating again. This past spring, Google added DisplayPort support to the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro in a Feature Drop update, allowing for easy wired connections to external monitors. Then, tinkering in Android 14 QPR3 Beta 2.1, Mishaal Rahman was able to get a new desktop interface up and running, complete with Android apps running in resizeable floating windows. It&#8217;s not confirmed that Android 15 will ship with a built-in desktop mode, but the bones are there. It does make me wonder, though: why? What would a desktop interface add to Android? ↫ Taylor Kerns at Android Police I&#8217;m actually fairly convinced Android could, indeed, serve as an excellent desktop operating system, but without any official backing by Google, it&#8217;s always been a massive hack to use Android with a mouse and keyboard. It&#8217;s not so much the hardware support &#8211; it&#8217;s all there &#8211; but rather the software support, and the clunky way common Android UI tasks feel when performing them with a mouse. I&#8217;ve installed Android desktop &#8216;distributions&#8217; countless times, and the third-party hacks they use, like clunky taskbars and custom menus and so on, make for a horrid user experience. Samsung DEX seems to be the only somewhat successful attempt at adding a desktop mode to Android, but it can&#8217;t be installed on any regular PC or laptop, and requires cumbersome cabling or expensive docks, making it more of a curiosity than a true desktop mode in the sense most of us are thinking of. This feature needs to come from Google itself, and it needs to be something third parties can use in their ROMs and x86 builds so we can truly use Android on a desktop. I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s going to happen, though. It&#8217;s clear Google is more interested in pushing Chrome OS for desktop and laptop use, and it seems more likely that any desktop mode that gets added to Android is going to be similar in nature to DEX &#8211; something you can only use by hooking up your phone to a display and configuring wireless input devices. Cool, but not exactly something that will turn Android into a desktop contender.

## Texas coast braces for Beryl, expected to regain hurricane strength

date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA

houston, texas — Texas officials Saturday urged coastal residents to brace for a potential hit by Beryl as the storm is expected to regain hurricane strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 


"We're expecting the storm to make landfall somewhere on the Texas coast sometime Monday, if the current forecast is correct," said Jack Beven, a senior hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. "Should that happen, it'll most likely be a Category 1 hurricane." 


The earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the Caribbean islands earlier in the week. It then battered Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane, toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths before weakening to a tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan Peninsula. 


Texas officials warned the state's entire coastline to brace for possible flooding, heavy rain and wind as they wait for a more defined path of the storm. The hurricane center has issued hurricane and storm surge warnings from Baffin Bay south of Corpus Christi to San Luis Pass, less than 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Houston. 


Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the acting governor while Governor Greg Abbott is traveling in Taiwan, issued a preemptive disaster declaration for 121 counties.  


"Beryl is a determined storm, and incoming winds and potential flooding will pose a serious threat to Texans who are in Beryl's path at landfall and as it makes its way across the state for the following 24 hours," Patrick said in a statement Saturday.




Some Texas coastal cities called for voluntary evacuations in low-lying areas prone to flooding, banned beach camping, and urged tourists traveling on the July 4 holiday weekend to move recreational vehicles from coastal parks. 


Mitch Thames, a spokesperson for Matagorda County, said Saturday that officials issued a voluntary evacuation request for the coastal areas of the county about 160 kilometers (about 99 miles) southwest of Houston to inform the large number of visitors in the area for the holiday weekend. 


"I certainly don't want to ruin the holiday weekend for our visitors. But at the same time, our Number 1 goal is the health and safety of all our visitors and of course our residents," Thames said. 


Residents secure homes with boards, sandbags


In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short and return home early if possible. Officials asked residents to secure their homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to guard against possible flooding. 


"We're taking the storm very serious and we're asking the community to take the storm very serious as well," Corpus Christi Fire Chief Brandon Wade said Friday.  


Traffic has been nonstop for the past three days at Ace Hardware in Corpus Christi as customers buy up tarps, rope, duct tape, sandbags and generators, employee Elizabeth Landry said Saturday. 


"They're just worried about the wind, the rain," she said. "They're wanting to prepare just in case." 


Ben Koutsoumbaris, general manager of Island Market on Corpus Christi's Padre Island, said there's "definitely a lot of buzz about the incoming storm," with customers stocking up on food and drinks — particularly meat and beer. 


"I heard there's been some talk about people having like hurricane parties," he said by telephone Saturday. 




County mandates evacuation


In Refugio County, north of Corpus Christi along Texas' Gulf Coast, officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for its 6,700 residents Saturday. 


Refugio County Judge Jhiela "Gigi" Poynter, the county's top elected official, said that based on the growing confidence of Beryl's track and the uncertainty regarding the storm's intensity and holiday weekend traffic that is already backing up roads, she made the decision to call for the mandatory evacuation. 


"I would rather be cautious and let Tropical Storm Beryl come crawling in with a little bit of rain and a little bit of wind to an empty Refugio County than the alternative if it were to strengthen more than the predictions, which we know has happened with several storms in the past," Poynter said in a video posted on Facebook. 


On Saturday, Beryl was about 615 kilometers (about 382 miles) southeast of Corpus Christi and had top sustained winds of 95 kilometers (50 miles) per hour, according to the National Hurricane Center. It was moving west-northwest at 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) per hour.


Before hitting Mexico and moving into the Gulf, Beryl had already spread destruction in Jamaica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados this week. Three people have been reported dead in Grenada, three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in Venezuela and two in Jamaica, officials said.

## Storm Beryl spares Mexico's Yucatan beaches, takes aim at Texas

date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA

CANCUN/TULUM, Mexico — Tropical Storm Beryl was blowing out to the Gulf of Mexico on Friday afternoon and appeared likely to reach Texas by late Sunday, after its strong winds and heavy rain largely spared Mexico's top beach destinations.


The core of the storm, downgraded from a hurricane, crossed the Yucatan Peninsula by Friday afternoon, with its maximum wind speeds slowing to around 105 kph after striking near the coastal beach resort of Tulum in the morning.


The storm, which at one point intensified to a massive Category 5 hurricane, left a deadly trail of destruction across the Caribbean earlier this week. However, there were no casualties in Mexico, the head of the country's civil protection agency, Laura Velazquez, said in a press conference on Friday afternoon.


While Beryl's passage over Mexico's Quintana Roo and Yucatan states resulted in slower winds, the U.S. National Hurricane Center still forecast dangerous storm surges in the surrounding area.


For those who hunkered down as Beryl churned overhead, a sense of relief prevailed.


"Holy cow! It was an experience!" said Mexican tourist Juan Ochoa, who was staying in Tulum.


"Really only some plants flew up in the air," he said. "Thank God we're all OK."


Tourist infrastructure was without major damage in Quintana Roo, the state government said in a statement.


Still, many in the area lost electricity, including 40% of Tulum, said Guillermo Nevarez, an official with Mexico's national electricity company CFE, speaking to local broadcaster Milenio.


Civil protection chief Velazquez said she expected service to be restored in full by Sunday.


Among Mexico's top tourist getaways, the Yucatan Peninsula is known for its white sand beaches, lush landscapes and Mayan ruins.


Stranded tourists camped out in Cancun's international airport on Friday, unsure of when they would make it home.


Nora Vento said her flight home to Chile was postponed multiple times, and that her airline's counter was unstaffed.


"So, I don't know when I will get to Chile," she said.


Beryl, currently located over the port of Progreso in Mexico's Yucatan state, was expected to pick up intensity as it enters the Gulf of Mexico and forecast to regain hurricane status and approach the western Gulf coast on Sunday.




A hurricane watch was in effect for the Texas coast from the mouth of the Rio Grande northward to Sargent, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).


Mexico's meteorological service issued a hurricane watch for the northeastern coast of Mexico from Barra el Mezquital to the mouth of the Rio Grande.


"There is an increasing risk of damaging hurricane-force winds and life-threatening storm surge in portions of northeastern Mexico and the lower and middle Texas Coast late Sunday and Monday where hurricane and storm surge watches have been issued," the NHC said.


It warned that flash and urban flooding were possible across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas from Sunday through the middle of next week.


Rainfall of 13 to 25 centimeters, with localized amounts of 38 centimeters, is projected across portions of the Texas Gulf Coast and eastern Texas beginning late on Sunday through the middle of next week.


Mexico's national water commission, CONAGUA, flagged a risk of flooding around the tourist hubs, as well as in neighboring Campeche state.


Quintana Roo schools were closed, as were local beaches, and officials lifted a temporary ban on alcohol sales.


Beryl was the first hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic season, and this week became the earliest Category 5 hurricane on record, with scientists pointing to its rapid strengthening as almost certainly fueled by human-caused climate change.


Before reaching Mexico, Beryl wreaked havoc across several Caribbean islands. It swept through Jamaica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in addition to unleashing heavy rainfall on northern Venezuela. It has claimed at least 11 lives, tearing apart buildings while felling power lines and trees.


Destruction in the islands of Grenada was especially pronounced.


Prime Minister Dickon Mitchell pointed to major damage to homes in Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique during a video briefing Thursday night. Parts of the latter two islands suffered "almost complete devastation," he said.


"Many of our citizens have lost everything."


Mexico's major oil platforms, primarily located in the southern rim of the Gulf of Mexico, are not expected to be affected or shut down.


Beryl is also expected to have little impact on U.S. offshore oil and gas production, energy companies said on Friday while evacuating personnel from some facilities out of caution.


Research by the ClimaMeter consortium determined that climate change significantly intensified Beryl. According to the study, the storm's severity, along with its associated rainfall and wind speed, saw an increase of 10%-30% as a direct result of climate change.

## Republicans focus on Harris as talk of replacing Biden intensifies

date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — For years it's been a Republican scare tactic.


A vote to reelect President Joe Biden, the GOP often charges, is really a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris. It's an attack line sometimes tinged with racist and misogynist undertones and often macabre imagery.


But after Biden's dismal performance at last week's presidential debate, which has sparked Democratic calls for him to step aside, what was once dismissed as a far-right conspiracy — Harris replacing Biden — could now have a chance of coming to pass. And Republicans, including Donald Trump, are ramping up their attacks.


Trump and his allies have been rolling out new attack lines against Harris, insulting her abilities, painting her as Biden's chief enabler and accusing her of being part of a coverup of his health. It's an effort, campaign officials insist, is not a reflection of their concerns about a potential change at the top of the ticket, given Biden's insistence he is not leaving the race.


But in a post marking Independence Day on his Truth Social site Thursday, Trump singled out Harris, calling her his "potentially new Democrat Challenger" and giving her a new derisive nickname: "Laffin' Kamala Harris."


"She did poorly in the Democrat Nominating process, starting out at Number Two, and ending up defeated and dropping out, even before getting to Iowa, but that doesn't mean she's not a "highly talented" politician! Just ask her Mentor, the Great Willie Brown of San Francisco," he wrote. (Harris dated Brown in the mid-1990s.)


The post came after Trump campaign senior advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles released a statement earlier this week that offered a different, but similar, moniker, calling her Biden's "Cackling Copilot Kamala Harris."




Trump also posted an expletive-laced video, which was first been reported by The Daily Beast, in which he was captured on the golf course calling Biden an "old broken-down pile of crap" and declaring that he'd driven the president from the race. (Trump, in interviews, has repeatedly said he did not expect Biden to be pushed aside.)


"He's quitting the race," Trump said. "And that means we have Kamala. I think she's going to be better. She's so bad. She's so pathetic," he said.


Allies have also joined the attacks, painting Harris as a chief defender of Biden's faculties and accusing her of lying to the American public.


Biden, the White House and his campaign insist he has no plans to drop out of the race. He told reporters Friday he was "completely ruling that out."


White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back against the tenor of attacks against Harris, particularly Trump's decision to invoke a decades-old relationship.


"I think it's gross, I think it's disturbing," Jean-Pierre told reporters Friday aboard Air Force One. "She should be respected in the role that she has as vice president. She should be respected like any other vice president before her who was in that room. It is appalling that, I'm going to be careful here, that a former president is saying that about a current vice president. And we should call that out — it is not OK."


It remains unclear how Harris would fare against Trump, compared to Biden. Replacing a candidate this late in a presidential cycle — much less an incumbent president who has already sailed through the Democratic Party's primaries — would be unprecedented in modern history, and the mechanics are complicated and potentially messy.


Polling shows that Harris' favorability ratings are similar to Biden's and Trump's. A June AP-NORC poll found about 4 in 10 Americans have a favorable opinion of her. But the share of those who have an unfavorable opinion is slightly lower than for Trump and Biden, and about 1 in 10 have no opinion of her yet.


Harris, at 59, would be a marked generational contrast to Trump, who is 78 and has also shown signs of aging. As the first woman, the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president, she would also chart a potentially barrier-breaking candidacy that could draw the support of women, minority voters and younger people — groups with whom Trump has been working to make significant inroads.


Harris has also been the Biden administration's leading voice on abortion rights, an animating issue for Democrats since the overturning of Roe v. Wade that could again motivate turnout this fall.


Trump's campaign, however, said it was confident in Trump's chances regardless of his opponent and dismissed the idea that Harris might pose a greater challenge to Trump, seeing her as a more polarizing figure than the president.

## Heat wave scorches much of US; record-setting temperatures predicted

date: 2024-07-06, from: VOA News USA

portland, oregon — A slow-moving and potentially record-setting heat wave is spreading across the Western United States, the National Weather Service said, sending many residents in search of a cool haven from the dangerously high temperatures.


The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. are also sweltering, with oppressive heat and humidity expected to last through Saturday.


Widespread temperature records are expected to be tied or even broken during the heat wave, with much of the West Coast likely to see temperatures that are between 15- and 30-degrees Fahrenheit (8 and 16 degrees Celsius) higher than average, the National Weather Service said.


"The duration of this heat is also concerning, as scorching above average temperatures are forecast to linger into next week," the weather service said.


In the Portland, Oregon, suburb of Gresham, Sherri Thompson, 52, was waiting in her car with her 14-year-old Chihuahua Kiwani for a cooling center to open late Friday morning. Thompson has lived in her car for three years and can only run its air conditioning for about 20 minutes at a time as it causes the engine to overheat.


Thompson said the high temperatures prompted health concerns, as she has been hospitalized for heat stroke in the past.


"I have anxiety and panic attacks and I get worried," she said. "I don't want to have another heat stroke, and everything just triggers my anxiety a lot." 


Pavement, sidewalks magnify heat


Inside the air-conditioned center, Multnomah County spokesperson Julia Comnes oversaw county staff and people working with a local homeless services provider as they lined up thin mattresses in rows on the floor and set up cots for people with disabilities. She said the space had capacity for up to 80 people.


"We had a pretty cool June, so our bodies aren't totally acclimated yet to the heat," she said. "For people living outside or more vulnerable people, the cooling space like this is really important for them to just cool off for a few hours."


The blistering weather in the Portland region is expected to last at least through Monday, National Weather Service meteorologist Clinton Rockey said. If the triple-digit Fahrenheit temperatures (well over 37 degrees Celsius) stretch into Tuesday, then the region will match a record last seen in July 1941, with five consecutive days of more than 100-degree weather, Rockey said.


The duration is a problem: Many homes in the area lack air conditioning, and round-the-clock hot weather means people's bodies can't cool down at night. The issue is compounded in many city settings, where concrete and pavement can store the heat, essentially acting as an oven.


"That's what drives people batty," Rockey said. "It's going to be obnoxious. And unfortunately for some people, if you're not having good shelter, it could be a very challenging, life-threatening situation."


Heat leads to 13 deaths


In Arizona's Maricopa County, which encompasses the city of Phoenix, there have been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, while the causes of more than 160 other suspected heat deaths were still under investigation, according to the county's most recent report on such deaths through June 29.


That doesn't include the death of a 10-year-old boy earlier this week in Phoenix, who suffered a "heat-related medical event" while hiking with his family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to the Phoenix Police Department.


Among extremes, the forecast for Furnace Creek in Death Valley National Park calls for daytime highs of 129 degrees Fahrenheit (53.8 degrees Celsius) Sunday, and then around 130 F (54.44 C) through Wednesday. The official world record for hottest temperature recorded on Earth was 134 degrees F (56.67 C) in Death Valley in July 1913, but some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F recorded there in July 2021.


At Bullhead City, Arizona, the temperature already had reached 111 F (44.4 C) by 11 a.m. Friday. The city opened a pair of cooling centers for seniors and others, but locals seemed to be taking it in stride.


"While this is a heat wave and we urge everyone to be cautious, we typically don't see large attendance at our cooling centers unless there are power outages," Bullhead City spokesperson Mackenzie Covert said Friday.


Figure skaters took to the ice at the Reno Ice Rink in Nevada starting at 6 a.m. Friday, general manager Kevin Sunde said. By the time the rink closes at 10:30 p.m. Friday, Sunde expected nearly 300 people would have visited, with more parents hanging around to watch kids' hockey practice than usual.


"They may not be getting on the ice themselves, but enjoying the cool," Sunde said. "We're the only sheet of ice within about an hour's drive."

## Trump denies knowledge of Project 2025, allies' plan to transform US government

date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA

miami — Donald Trump distanced himself Friday from Project 2025, a massive, proposed overhaul of the federal government drafted by longtime allies and former officials in his administration — days after the head of the think tank responsible for the program suggested there would be a second American Revolution.  


"I know nothing about Project 2025," Trump posted on his social media website. "I have no idea who is behind it. I disagree with some of the things they're saying and some of the things they're saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal. Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them."


Plan expands presidential power


The 922-page plan outlines a dramatic expansion of presidential power and a plan to fire as many as 50,000 government workers to replace them with Trump loyalists.


President Joe Biden's reelection campaign has worked to draw more attention to the agenda, particularly as Biden tries to keep fellow Democrats on board after his disastrous debate. 


Trump has outlined his own plans to remake the government if he wins a second term, including staging the largest deportation operation in U.S. history and imposing tariffs on potentially all imports. His campaign has previously warned outside allies not to presume to speak for the former president and suggested their transition-in-waiting efforts were unhelpful. 


'The second American Revolution'


Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts said on Steve Bannon's "War Room" podcast Tuesday that Republicans are "in the process of taking this country back." Former U.S. Representative Dave Brat of Virginia hosted the show for Bannon, who is serving a four-month prison term.   


"We are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be," Roberts said. 




Those comments were widely circulated online and blasted by the Biden campaign, which issued a statement saying Trump and his allies were "dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America." 


Some of the people involved in Project 2025 are former senior administration officials. The project's director is Paul Dans, who served as chief of staff at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management under Trump. Trump's campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt was featured in one of Project 2025's videos. 


John McEntee, a former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office in the Trump administration, is a senior adviser. McEntee told the conservative news site The Daily Wire this year that Project 2025's team would integrate a lot of its work with the campaign after the summer when Trump would announce his transition team.   


Trump's comments on Project 2025 come ahead of the Republican Party's meetings next week to begin to draft its party platform. 


Project 2025 has been preparing its own 180-day agenda for the next administration that it plans to share privately, rather than as part of its public-facing book of priorities for a Republican president. A key Trump ally, Russ Vought, who contributed to Project 2025 and is drafting this final pillar, is also on the Republican National Committee's platform writing committee. 


A spokesperson for the plan said Project 2025 is not tied to a specific candidate or campaign.   


"We are a coalition of more than 110 conservative groups advocating policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative president," a statement said. "But it is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to implement."   


Plan 'should scare' Americans, say Democrats 


The Democratic National Committee said the plan and the Trump campaign are part of the same "MAGA operation." A Biden campaign spokesperson said that Project 2025 staff members are also leading the Republican policy platform. 


"Project 2025 is the extreme policy and personnel playbook for Trump's second term that should scare the hell out of the American people," said Ammar Moussa.   


On Thursday, as the country celebrated Independence Day and Biden prepared for his television interview after his halting debate performance, the president's campaign posted on X a shot from the dystopian TV drama "The Handmaid's Tale" showing a group of women in the show's red dresses and white hats standing in formation by a reflecting pool with a cross at the far end where the Washington Monument should be. The story revolves around women who are stripped of their identities and forced to give birth to children for other couples in a totalitarian regime. 


"Fourth of July under Trump's Project 2025," the post said.

## Google is bringing Fuchsia OS to Android devices, but not in the way you’d think

date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News

To evolve Fuchsia beyond smart home devices, Google has been working on projects such as Starnix to run unmodified Linux binaries on Fuchsia devices. In addition, since late April of this year, Google has been working on a new project called “microfuchsia” that aims to make Fuchsia bootable on existing devices via virtualization. Microfuchsia, according to Google, is a Fuchsia OS build that targets virtual machines and is designed to be bootable in virtualization solutions such as QEMU and pKVM. ↫ Mishaal Rahman at Android Authority The goal here might be, according to Mishaal Rahman, might be to use this new microfuchsia thing to replace the stripped-down Android version that&#8217;s currently being used inside Android&#8217;s pKVM to run certain secured workloads. Relevant patches have been submitted to both the Fuchsia and Android side of things for this very purpose. At this point, it really seems that Google&#8217;s grand ambitions with Fuchsia simply didn&#8217;t survive the massive employee culling, with leadership probably reasoning that Android and Chrome OS are good enough, and that replacing them with something homegrown and possibly more suited &#8211; speculation, of course &#8211; simply isn&#8217;t worth the investment in both time and money. It probably makes sense from a financial standpoint, but it&#8217;s still sad.

## US refutes Russia's denial of violating North Korea sanctions

date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The United States has flatly rejected Russia’s claim that it has not violated international sanctions imposed on North Korea, calling on Moscow to stop illegal arms transfers from Pyongyang.


“The U.S. and like-minded countries have successfully highlighted Russia’s U.N. Security Council Resolutions violations,” a State Department spokesperson said in an email to VOA’s Korean Service on Wednesday, responding to an inquiry made about Russia’s denial of violating North Korea sanctions.


“Unfortunately, we now have a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council willing to openly flout sanctions to support the Kim [Jong Un] regime’s priorities.”


The spokesperson continued: “We call on the DPRK and Russia to cease unlawful arms transfers and urge the DPRK to take concrete steps toward abandoning all nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles, and related programs.” DPRK stands for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, North Korea’s official name.


In a Monday press conference, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia insisted that his country had complied with international sanctions against North Korea.


“We’re not violating the North Korea sanctions regime and all those allegations that come out. They are not proved by material evidence,” he said.


The Russian ambassador went even further, questioning the integrity of a now-defunct U.N. panel of experts charged with monitoring North Korea sanctions. The panel’s annual mandate was not extended this year, following Russia’s veto at the U.N. Security Council in March.


Nebenzia alleged that the panel of experts got involved in the politics after being encouraged by certain countries, adding that "that was the major mistake that they made."


“The sanctions regime against DPRK is an unprecedented thing in the United Nations. It’s not time bound. It doesn’t have any provisions for reviewing, and this cannot be tolerated.”


The Kremlin’s refusal to renew the expert panel’s annual mandate marked a drastic change from its earlier support for U.N. Resolution 1718, which put in place an arms embargo on North Korea by banning all imports and exports of most weapons and related material.


The U.N. Security Council passed the resolution unanimously in October 2006, just several days after North Korea’s first nuclear test.


This week’s exchange between Washington and Moscow comes as Russia has been deepening military ties with North Korea.


Russian President Vladmir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty during their summit in Pyongyang last month.




In recent months. the U.S. government has repeatedly blown the whistle on Russia’s alleged violations of international sanctions, accusing Moscow of financially and materially facilitating Pyongyang’s efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction.


In a May briefing, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby released specific figures of the refined oil Russia has provided to North Korea so far this year, stressing it has already exceeded the limit set by the U.N. Security Council.


“Russia has been shipping refined petroleum to the DPRK. Russian shipments have already pushed DPRK inputs above [those] mandated by the U.N. Security Council. In March alone, Russia shipped more than 165,000 barrels of refined petroleum to the DPRK,” Kirby said.


In October last year, the White House released three satellite images showing containers moved by ships and trains, saying North Korea had provided Russia with more than 1,000 containers of military equipment and ammunition.


Experts in Washington say this standoff between the U.S. and Russia over North Korea will likely persist for some time.


Scott Snyder, president of the Korea Economic Institute of America, told VOA’s Korean Service via email on Thursday that the recent defense pact between Moscow and Pyongyang is not something the U.S. can afford to ignore.


“North Korea will remain a source of conflict in U.S.-Russia relations as long as North Korea sustains their strategic relationship, which will continue at least until the end of military hostilities in Ukraine,” Snyder said.


Evans Revere, who formerly served as deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said in an email to VOA’s Korean Service on Friday that Russia is setting itself up as North Korea’s backer.


“Russia has made it clear that it intends to oppose U.N. Security Council sanctions, work with North Korea and others to find ways to get around current U.N. Security Council restrictions and strengthen its tactical and strategic coordination with North Korea,” Revere said.


“Russia, which was once part of the important coalition supporting the use of pressure and sanctions to deal with Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs, has now gone over to the other side and become Pyongyang's de facto protector.”

## Apple bows to Russian censorship once more, removes VPN apps from Russian App Store

date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News

A few weeks ago, I broke the news that Mozilla had removed several anti-censorship Firefox extensions from its store in Russia, and a few days later I also broke the news they reversed course on their decision and reinstated the extensions. Perhaps not worthy of a beauty prize, as a Dutch saying goes, but at least the turnaround time was short, and they did the right thing in the end. Well, let&#8217;s see how Apple is going to deal with the exact same situation. Novaya Gazeta Europe reports that bowing under pressure from the same Russian censors that targeted Mozilla, the company has removed a whole slew of VPN applications used by Russians to evade the stringent totalitarian censorship laws in the warmongering nation. Apple has removed several apps offering virtual private network (VPN) services from the Russian AppStore, following a request from Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media regulator, independent news outlet Mediazona reported on Thursday. The VPN services removed by Apple include leading services such as ProtonVPN, Red Shield VPN, NordVPN and Le VPN. Those living in Russia will no longer be able to download the services, while users who already have them on their phones can continue using them, but will be unable to update them. ↫ Novaya Gazeta Europe Apple has a long history of falling in line with the demands from dictators and totalitarian regimes, and Russia is no stranger to telling Apple what to do. Earlier this year, Apple was ordered to remove an application developed by the team of the murdered opposition figure Alexey Navalny, and of course, Apple rolled over and complied. Much like Apple&#8217;s grotesque suck-up behaviour in China, This stands in stark contrast to Apple&#8217;s whining, complaining, and tantrums in the European Union. It seems Apple finds it more comfortable to operating under dictators than in democracies.

## Hurricane Beryl destroys homes, uproots trees in Grenada

date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA

new york — The extent of Hurricane Beryl's damage became clearer Friday, as communications were reestablished with the small, storm-ravaged eastern Caribbean islands and relief began to arrive. 


The Grenadian islands of Carriacou and Petit Martinique sustained the most severe damage when Beryl made landfall Monday as a Category 4 storm and later saw its winds strengthen to a Category 5. About 11,000 people inhabit the two islands. 


"The desalination plants have been knocked out; all of the cell towers have been knocked out; all of the fiber optic cables have been knocked out," said Simon Springett, the United Nations resident coordinator for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean. "The roads are impassable. We probably have about 95% of the housing stock destroyed. And by default, all of the local businesses, all the income-generating activities — and the list goes on." 


Beryl is the first Category 5 hurricane on record in the Atlantic Ocean in June. The hurricane season runs until November 30 and officials with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are forecasting 17 to 25 named storms.




Springett, who briefed reporters from Grenada, said communications were only restored with Carriacou Thursday night. About 9,000 people live on the island known for its coral reefs and sandy beaches. 


"The entire island is completely affected," he said. 


Rough seas hamper delivery of help


Springett said the relief operation has been complicated by extremely rough seas following the hurricane and airport control towers being knocked offline. 


"So, there is only fly-by visibility," he said. "Even when things get into the airport, there are no roads to be able to access the goods." 


He said a French naval vessel is due to arrive in Carriacou on Friday. Neighbors Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago also have sent support. 


The United Nations, which has nine agencies active in Grenada normally, is surging more staff in. Springett said a supply ship would be arriving Saturday from St. Vincent and the Grenadines to bring aid to the outer islands of the Grenadines and then continue to Carriacou and Petite Martinique. 


Three islands in St. Vincent and the Grenadines also were hit badly: Canouan, Union Island and Mayreau. Springett said about 15,500 people live there. 


One confirmed death in Jamaica


Beryl hit Jamaica Wednesday. It was the strongest storm there in over a decade, but the island was spared the worst. 


Dennis Zulu, U.N. resident coordinator for Jamaica, told reporters on the same briefing call that about 70% of people are without water and 40% without power. 




The island is a major tourism destination and Zulu said the government had moved quickly to reopen the main tourist airport at Montego Bay and to clear road access to resorts. 


"From preliminary assessments, very little harm came to the infrastructure in terms of tourist hotels and resorts," Zulu said.  "So that is really positive." 


He said at least one person was confirmed dead in Jamaica from Beryl and a flash flood warning remains in effect. There was damage to homes, but some government shelters were shutting after people had returned home. 


"Jamaica is up and running, if I may say that, and the government is moving seriously to ensure that," Zulu said. 


The United Nations has made an initial allocation of $1.5 million from its emergency fund for Grenada and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Another $2.5 million has been allocated for Jamaica.

## Psion OPL: when we owned our devices

date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News

We talked about Psion last week, and we&#8217;re talking about Psion again this week. This time, Kian Ryan highlights a very important capability of Psion&#8217;s devices, a capability that&#8217;s entirely absent from today&#8217;s mobile devices: a built-in IDE and dedicated programming language so you can write code and build applications, including ones with a graphical user interface, right on the device. All Psion devices could run OPL, either preinstalled on the device or via a DATAPAK memory card. It&#8217;s a BASIC-esque programming language, and while you could develop OPL programs on your PC in DOS, Psion devices also shipped with an IDE preinstalled so you could get just as much done on the device itself. Back then, this wasn&#8217;t particularly unique, but these days, mobile devices have become so locked-down and dumb that developing applications on-device is basically a non-starter. Which can’t be said about my current mobile. My mobile is a great device to consume content on, but it has no built in tools to extend its functionality. If I want to build an application for it, I have to use another computer to download a build environment, build the application, sign it, and then transfer the packaged app to my phone. On the Psion, all the tools are right there, on my home screen. It does feel like we’re missing an opportunity here. ↫ Kian Ryan They&#8217;re entirely right, of course. Our current mobile devices are faster and technically more capable than ever, but extending the functionality of your smartphone using the smartphone itself by writing and compiling code on it is far more cumbersome than it was in the past. Even my Psion Organiser II LZ64, from 1986, has OPL on it, and if I took the time to relearn the basic BASIC I once knew, I could probably still program something useful on it today, almost 40 years later, without being gatekept by anyone, and without needing any other device. That&#8217;s something quite magical that we&#8217;ve lost, and that&#8217;s sad.

## Citing Supreme Court immunity ruling, Trump's lawyers seek to freeze classified documents case

date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA

washington  — Donald Trump asked a federal judge Friday to freeze the classified documents case against him in light of a Supreme Court ruling this week that said former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.


Trump's lawyers told U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon that the prosecution should be put on pause until she resolves pending defense motions that assert that Trump is immune from criminal charges in the case and that special counsel Jack Smith was illegally appointed by the Justice Department.


Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in a 6-3 opinion Monday that presidents enjoy absolute immunity from prosecution for actions involving their core constitutional powers and are presumptively immune for all other official acts. In a separate concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that Smith's appointment was invalid because there is "no law establishing" the office of the special counsel.




The request Friday underscores the potentially far-reaching implications of the high court's opinion. On Tuesday, sentencing for Trump's hush money convictions was postponed until at least September as the judge in the New York case agreed to weigh the possible impact of the opinion.


The opinion came in a separate case brought by Smith charging Trump with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. But Trump's lawyers in the documents case in Florida, where he is charged with illegally retaining top secret records from his presidency at his Mar-a-Lago estate, have challenged the indictment on the same legal grounds raised in Monday's Supreme Court opinion.


Cannon heard arguments last month on the legality of Smith's appointment but did not immediately rule. She has also not ruled on the immunity question.


"Resolution of these threshold questions is necessary to minimize the adverse consequences to the institution of the Presidency arising from this unconstitutional investigation and prosecution," defense lawyers wrote as they requested the opportunity to make additional paperwork.


They said the case should be frozen, with the exception of a separate, and also unresolved, dispute over an effort by prosecutors to bar Trump from making public comments that could endanger FBI agents involved in the case.

## 3 people attacked by sharks in Florida, Texas

date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA

NEW YORK — Sharks attacked three people on beaches in Texas and Florida on Thursday as the Independence Day weekend got underway, according to officials, adding to a growing list of such incidents in the U.S. this summer. 


A 21-year-old Ohio man was bitten on his foot while standing in knee-deep water at Florida's New Smyrna Beach, said Tamra Malphurs, interim director of Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. He was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. 


On the same day at South Padre Island on the Gulf Coast of Texas, four people encountered a shark and two were bitten, according to a press release by Texas Parks and Wildlife. The two victims were taken to a hospital, but their conditions were unknown. 


There have been 28 reported shark attacks in the U.S. so far this year, according to the website Tracking Sharks. At least three others, in addition to Thursday's attacks, have occurred since June 2, including a California man who was injured by a great white shark and a man in Hawaii who was killed by a shark. 


Three women were injured by what authorities believed to be a bull shark in Walton County, Florida, the state where shark attacks are most frequent, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History's International Shark Attack File. 


The museum found that unprovoked shark attacks and fatalities around the world rose slightly in 2023 — there were a total of 69 attacks, 10 of which were fatal. 


The U.S. had the most incidents last year with 36 attacks and two fatalities. The number of shark attacks have trended downward since they spiked in 2021 with 47 attacks, the most ever recorded by the museum. 


Gavin Naylor, director of the Florida Museum of Natural History’s shark research program, said that while the numbers may oscillate year by year, reported shark bites have dropped slightly decade by decade. He attributes the trend to commercial fisheries reducing global shark populations. 


"But the number of people on beaches keeps going up. And as a few more shark populations are starting to recover, I think in the next 10 years we may see an increase in incidents," said Naylor.

## Former reporter gets $235,000, part of lawsuit over police raid on newspaper

date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA

TOPEKA, Kansas  — A former reporter for a weekly Kansas newspaper has agreed to accept $235,000 to settle part of her federal lawsuit over a police raid on the paper that made a small community the focus of a national debate over press freedoms.  


The settlement removed the former police chief in Marion from the lawsuit filed by former Marion County Record reporter Deb Gruver, but it doesn't apply to two other officials she sued over the raid: the Marion County sheriff and the county's prosecutor. Gruver's lawsuit is among five federal lawsuits filed over the raid against the city, the county and eight current or former elected officials or law enforcement officers. 


Gruver's attorney did not immediately respond to emails Friday seeking comment. An attorney for the city, its insurance company, the former chief and others declined to comment but released a copy of the June 25 settlement agreement after the Record filed an open records request. He also provided a copy to The Associated Press.  


Former Police Chief Gideon Cody led the Aug. 11, 2023, raid on the newspaper's office, the home of publisher Eric Meyer and the home of a then-city council member who had been critical of the then-mayor. Marion is a city of about 1,900 people set among rolling prairie hills about 150 miles (241 kilometers) southwest of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Record is known for its aggressive coverage of local government. 


At the time, Cody said he had evidence that the newspaper, reporter Phyllis Zorn and the city council member had committed identity theft or other computer crimes in obtaining information about a local business owner's driving record. All his targets said they did nothing illegal, and no charges were ever filed. 


A federal lawsuit filed by Meyer and the newspaper alleges that the raid caused the death the next day of his 98-year-old mother, who lived with him, and he and the paper's attorney have suggested that the raid was Cody's response to the paper investigating his background. Cody seized Gruber's personal cell phone and had her desk searched; she had no connection to the driving record but was looking into Cody's past. 


The raid sparked national outrage, and Cody resigned as chief in early October, less than two months after the raid. Legal experts have said the raid likely violated state or federal laws.

## Retired General Breedlove says NATO must not capitulate to Russia

date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The United States will host a NATO summit in Washington next week, at which more military support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's ongoing invasion will top the agenda. 


Douglas Jones, deputy U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, told VOA earlier this week that NATO will put forward "concrete ways" to accelerate Ukraine's eventual membership in the alliance. 


Retired U.S. Air Force four-star General Philip Breedlove was the commander of U.S. European Command and the 17th Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO Allied Command Operations from 2013 to 2016.  


In an interview with VOA, Breedlove said that NATO should use next week's summit to detail how it will help Ukraine "win the war against Russia and to expel Russian forces from Ukrainian lands."  


Allowing Russia to keep that Ukrainian territory it has occupied would amount to "capitulation," Breedlove said, adding that whoever wins the U.S. presidential election in November must remember that capitulation to Russia's ambitions in Ukraine "is not a way forward."  


The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity: 


VOA: What are the main challenges for NATO ahead of the summit in Washington? 


Retired four-star U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove: I think the main challenge is going to be how to move forward with Ukraine. There are quite a number of NATO nations that want to get started on Ukraine's program to join [NATO], there are other nations that are not ready for that yet. And so I think that the compromise is this "bridge" to NATO, whereby Ukraine will be invited to join in the headquarters on a U.S. base somewhere. I hear that maybe Wiesbaden [Germany] is that place. More importantly though, since there will not be a formal offer to Ukraine for membership, the members of NATO are going to need to discuss how do we begin to guarantee the security of Ukraine. 


VOA: How do you think the elections in Europe and the U.K. will affect — and maybe already have affected — NATO's immediate future?  


Breedlove: So I would broaden that scope. In elections in America, elections in many of our countries, we see a growing nationalistic trend, some isolationist trends, and these are all going to have to be addressed by NATO as a body. Because the strength of NATO is solidarity first, and so we have to figure out how to maintain that solidarity in the alliance when we have several nations that are now challenging norms. NATO has always made it through this. I remind people — and some of my French friends hate it when I do — but we were once thrown out of a capital of a NATO country. And so NATO has faced challenges in the past.  


And I think that NATO will survive this current set of issues as well and frankly maybe be stronger. The absolute audacity, the criminality, the inhumane war that [Russian President] Mr. [Vladimir] Putin is waging on Ukraine is in a way drawing NATO closer together, even though there are less than perfect conversations about how we should go about fixing things. Broadly now, people understand what Mr. Putin is, what Russia represents, and the problems that this is going to give us in the future. And we see nations now realizing that they have to invest in their defense.  


VOA: According to Politico, some Trump-aligned national security experts are saying that he is "mulling a deal" where NATO commits to no further eastward expansion, specifically into Ukraine and Georgia, and negotiates with Putin over how much Ukrainian territory "Moscow can keep" in exchange for a cease-fire. What would that mean for Georgia and Ukraine?  


Breedlove: So, what you're talking about, to me, amounts to capitulation. I don't believe that Mr. [Donald] Trump would capitulate in quite that manner to Russia and give in to all of Russia's demands. I think what we need to focus on is what changes in respect to Russia in these conversations, remembering that Russia is a nation that amassed its army, marched across internationally recognized borders and is now trying to subjugate one of its neighbors. I do not believe that even Mr. Trump will sign up to that as an end result. 


At some point we will have to sit down at the table, and what it looks like coming away from the table, I think, is a long way from being determined. And I do not believe that the American people will support capitulation. … And so I think that whoever is the next president, as their team sits down to try to resolve this, we're going to have to remember that capitulation is not a way forward. 


VOA: If Georgia's domestic political problems grow, what effect will that have on its prospects for joining NATO? 


Breedlove: I think that the question should be asked like this: if Russia's interference in Georgia's internal affairs continues and gets worse, what does that mean? Because I believe that there is Russian bad money and Russian bad people and politics involved in Georgia right now. Georgia is a hybrid warfare battleground whereby Russia is trying to use all manner of influence to drag Georgia away from the West and to regain control of Georgian politics. 


VOA: It's clear that during next week's summit, Ukraine will not be offered NATO membership. But apart from the offer to establish a "bridge" at a NATO base, what do you think can be done to bring Ukraine and NATO closer together?   


Breedlove: Well, the first thing to do is to help them win this war. Our policies are very weak. We say things like "we're going to be there for as long as it takes" or "we're going to give them everything they need." What we fail to say is — we're going to be there as long as it takes to do what? We're going to give them everything they need to do what? And that "to do what" should sound something like "to completely defeat the Russian forces inside of Ukraine and drive them back behind Russia's borders." But we are not doing that. And so one of the most important things about this upcoming summit … is that we need a demonstrative public declaratory policy on how we would support Ukraine to win the war against Russia and to expel Russian forces from Ukrainian lands.

## Alaska Public Media given boost for local broadcasts

date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA

washington  — A grant of nearly $1 million is being provided to Alaska Public Media as part of a two-year plan to strengthen local news for rural communities.


The nonprofit Cooperation for Public Broadcasting, or CPB, awarded the $936,000 grant to the Alaska Public Media, which is made up of radio and TV media outlets.


Lori Townsend, news director for Alaska Public Media, or APM, said the funding will help deepen “the connection between the local community and its public broadcasting station.”


Investing in this way, she told VOA via email, means “the community will continue to support the local and regional journalism they can only get from their local newsroom.”


Townsend said the grant will allow Alaska Public Radio to help rural station partners better reach remote areas that have less coverage.


An NPR-member station, Alaska Public Radio produces national and state-specific daily news programming such as Alaska News Nightly. The award-winning statewide program has been broadcast for over four decades.


The stations also relay national and international news through NPR and the BBC. But many of the 733,400 Alaska residents receive important information in their regions from local stations, information such as emergency messages related to fires, earthquakes or other disasters as part of emergency messaging system for the state.




Most of Alaska's communities are not on the road system and public radio is a lifeline, said Townsend.


“The public radio system in Alaska has been a more than four-decade model of collaboration and providing critical news, information and public safety service to Alaskan communities,” she added.


Federal investment in rural communities is critical for the 99% of the U.S. population who have access to public broadcastings, said Brendan Daly, of CPB. The nonprofit oversees federal investment in public broadcasting.


Rural and Indigenous communities depend on the state’s public media for news and public affairs, said Daly. “This is especially true in Alaska, which is such a large and rural state.”


The two-year grant will be used to fund reporters and editors, travel and equipment.


“The editors and reporters will mostly likely be a mix of new hires and existing Alaska journalists, currently working in the APM network and other newsrooms in Alaska," said Townsend.


Stations will apply to host the new hires, Townsend said. The idea is to put the staff in stations across the state to make it easier to collaborate.


“We are in an exciting time of increased recognition of the importance of journalism in supporting and strengthening the bedrock of democracy,” said Townsend.


She added that the Alaska desk will work closely with communities on local priorities and on “elevating voices that are seldom heard.”


The plan is to produce stories that “resonate with not only Alaskans, but the rest of the nation and world, as geopolitical conflicts and world resource needs draw more attention to the Arctic,” she said.

## Australia plans to build secret data centers with Amazon

date: 2024-07-05, from: VOA News USA

SYDNEY — Australia said Thursday a $1.35 billion deal with U.S. technology giant Amazon to build three secure data centers for top-secret information will increase its military’s “war-fighting capacity.”


The data centers are to be built in secret locations in Australia and be run by an Australian subsidiary of the U.S. technology company Amazon Web Service, the government said.


The deal is part of Australia’s National Defense Strategy, outlining its commitment to Indo-Pacific security and maintaining “the global rules-based order.” The country has a long-standing military alliance with the United States and is a member, with the United Kingdom, U.S., Canada and New Zealand, of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.


Australian officials said the project would create a “state-of-the-art collaborative space” for intelligence and defense agencies to store and gain access to sensitive information in a centralized network.


Andrew Shearer, director-general of Australia’s Office of National Intelligence, said in a statement that the project would allow “greater interoperability with our most important international intelligence partners.”


Similar data clouds have been set up in the United States and Britain, allowing the sharing of information among agencies and departments.


Richard Marles, Australia’s deputy prime minister and defense minister, told reporters that highly sensitive national security data will be safely secured in the new system.


“If you consider that any sensor which is on a defense platform, which in turn feeds that data to a high tech capability, such as the Joint Strike Fighter, which will use that to engage in targeting or perhaps to defend itself from an in-coming threat, or ... to defend another asset, such as a ship — all of that is top secret data,” Marles said.


The government said the Amazon Web Services storage system will use artificial intelligence to detect suspected intrusions and to retrieve data.


Richard Buckland, a professor in CyberCrime, Cyberwar and Cyberterror at the University of New South Wales, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that the storage plan has risks.


“Putting more data together in a central spot and sharing it widely as people intend to do obviously increases the risk of a data breach,” he said.


In a statement, Amazon Web Services’ managing director in Australia, Iain Rouse, said the system would “enable the seamless sharing of classified data between Australia’s National Intelligence Community and the Australian Defense Force.”


The so-called top-secret cloud is scheduled to be in operation by 2027.

<p>The U.S. economy added 206,000 jobs in June, according to the labor department. But job growth in previous months was revised down significantly. What can we make of this data? And what does it mean for next steps for the Federal Reserve? Workers also saw the slowest pace of wage growth in two years. And later: views on France&#8217;s election and economy from a farmers market in the French city of Lille.</p>

## Moving to an RTOS on the RP2040

date: 2024-07-05, from: OS News

I&#8217;ve been working on a bunch of small projects involving microcontrollers. Currently a lot of them are based around the Raspberry Pi Pico boards because I like the development experience of those a lot. They have a decent SDK and cheap hardware to get started and the debugger works with gdb/openocd so it just integrates in all IDEs that support that. One of my current projects is making a fancy hardware controller for a bunch of video equipment I use. The main things that will be controlled are two PTZ cameras (those are cameras that have motors to move them). One stationary camera and the video switching equipment that that&#8217;s hooked up to. ↫ Martijn Braam There&#8217;s more to building something like this than connecting up hardware components &#8211; there&#8217;s also software that needs to be taken care of. In this case, the author is weighing several real-time operating systems for use in the project, namely FreeRTOS, NuttX, and Zephyr. If you&#8217;re working on a similar project, this article may help in choosing the RTOS that&#8217;s right for you.

<em><strong>Current conditions:</strong> Rain storms prompted China to evacuate 240,000 in the east • A heat wave is breaking records in Moscow • Beachgoers along the Gulf of Mexico are cautioned to beware dangerous rip currents this weekend.</em>
</p><h2>THE TOP FIVE</h2><h3>1. Fires rage in California as ‘very dangerous’ heat wave hits western states</h3><p>
	More than 100 million people in the United States remain under heat alerts. A dangerous heat wave is baking the West, with temperatures expected to peak today and tomorrow. In some desert areas, temperatures could reach 115 degrees Fahrenheit. “It’s not your typical heat wave,” <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-07-04/sweltering-heat-wildfire-smoke-mark-july-fourth-weekend?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZcdJ5Ge-duO3nAAozdn6X0XHnU8JvAOojkpEhPiH5rN8Q8Gna0O18M3fYCKvMNhHs1Vj4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> Joe Sirard, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. “This is a dangerous heat wave, this is a high-end heat wave.

The Thompson Fire in Northern California scorched 3,700 acres and forced nearly 30,000 people to evacuate. “Oppressive” heat and humidity will also plague the Southeast today and tomorrow.

Parts of southern Texas could feel the storm’s effects this weekend. At least 11 people have died in the hurricane and many buildings across several Caribbean islands remain without power.
</p><h3>3. Labour Party wins UK general election</h3><p>
	The Labour Party won a landslide victory in the U.K.’s general election, which means that Keir Starmer is the new prime minister and 14 years of Conservative rule have come to an end. Starmer has <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/make-britain-a-clean-energy-superpower/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ZcdJ5Ge-duO3nAAozdn6X0XHnU8JvAOojkpEhPiH5rN8Q8Gna0O18M3fYCKvMNhHs1Vj4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">vowed</a> to transform the U.K. into a “clean energy superpower.” Here are some of his environmental pledges:

<li>Double onshore wind, triple solar power, and quadruple offshore wind by 2030.</li>
<li>Upgrade the grid and speed up clean energy projects.</li>
<li>Deny new licenses for exploring new oil and gas fields in the North Sea.</li>
<li>Ban the sale of new gas and diesel cars by 2030 and increase charging access for EVs.</li>

## Not necessarily a “new dawn” for economic policy in the U.K.

date: 2024-07-05, from: Marketplace Morning Report

<p>While the Labour Party saw a historic win in Thursday&#8217;s general election in the U.K., the new prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, is without a raft of money to implement sweeping reforms. So how will the new government differ economically from the one seen under Conservative rule? And later, it&#8217;s hard to prepare a meal with a newborn in your hands. That inspired one couple to open a restaurant in Atlanta.</p>

## The Biochar King of Minneapolis

date: 2024-07-05, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUzNTQ2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDI4NTUwMH0.AenyRn_q_RQzTjIz7sdK9cC7jqZAcYorAS-X9YS8MpM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">
	Minneapolis may be the only city in the country with a carbon sequestration program manager on staff. Now, Jim Doten — who holds that title — is about to realize his dream of starting up one of the first municipally owned and operated carbon removal projects.
</p><p>
	The Minnesota metropolis has just purchased its very own biomass pyrolyzer, a machine that heats up tree clippings in a low-oxygen environment and turns them into a form of charcoal called <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/biochar-carbon-removal-microsoft" target="_self"><u>biochar</u></a>. As the wood grew, it sucked carbon out of the air during photosynthesis; as biochar, that carbon becomes stable for hundreds of years, if not longer.
</p><p>
	Biochar can be mixed into soil, and has a wide range of demonstrated benefits, including increasing crop yields and enhancing the soil’s capacity to hold water. Some studies suggest it can filter contaminants out of stormwater. The city plans to use the biochar in public works projects and donate it to community groups in “green zones,” neighborhoods with high levels of pollution and marginalized populations. It’s also in talks with other local governments that might be interested in buying some.
</p><p>
	“One of the things we want to do is be a regional resource for other government agencies,” Doten told me, “whether it be city, county, state agencies, making biochar available for projects addressing the effects of climate change, sequestering carbon, as well as providing environmental benefits throughout our infrastructure.”
</p><p>
	Studies say that we should be shoveling billions of tons of CO2 out of the skies each year by 2050 to keep climate change in check — and that’s on top of cutting emissions to near-zero. Scholars have compared the vast responsibility of cleaning up the carbon in the atmosphere to municipal waste management: Since the task is more of a public good than a profitable enterprise, it may be best suited for the folks we already rely on to take out the trash.
</p><p>
	A number of other municipalities have been experimenting with carbon removal to support their climate goals. Notably, Boulder County, Colorado teamed up with Flagstaff, Arizona, and a number of other cities, to form the <a href="https://grist.org/climate/why-boulder-and-flagstaff-are-pooling-resources-to-purchase-carbon-removal/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Four Corners Coalition</u></a>, which is pooling resources to finance local carbon removal projects. But Minneapolis is the first, at least that I’m aware of, to essentially start its own carbon removal department.</p><p>
	Doten became a biochar evangelist more than a decade ago. He first learned of the substance’s various benefits while working in southern Afghanistan with the Minnesota National Guard in 2012. He was serving as a hydrologist on an agribusiness development team and helping village farmers rebuild soil health to improve crop yields. When he returned to Minneapolis the following year, he was eager to test out biochar’s benefits at home.
</p><p>
	Over the decade that followed, Doten worked days as the supervisor of environmental services for the city’s health department. But on the side, he led a number of biochar passion project. He convinced the public works department to use biochar in landscaping projects along street medians. He started a partnership with the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux, a tribe that runs a compost facility, to provide a mix of compost and biochar to urban gardens around the city. He got the health department to sponsor a research trial at the community farm at <a href="https://www.littleearth.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Little Earth</u></a>, a federally-subsidized housing complex primarily occupied by indigenous families. Though the study was disrupted by vandalism, the city gathered enough data to show that the plots with biochar-amended compost saw superior plant health, food production and water retention during August drought conditions.
</p><p>
	Doten told me the limiting factor for expanding these programs was the availability of biochar. The city was buying it and shipping it in from elsewhere, which Doten was also not happy about because the emissions from shipping cuts into any climate benefits. Then, in 2019, he had the opportunity to see what the city could do if finding biochar wasn’t an issue. Bloomberg Philanthropies flew Doten and his colleagues to Stockholm, Sweden, where five years earlier, the charity had helped the city finance its own biochar production facility.
</p><p>
	“So I went to Stockholm along with one of our city council members and the head of public works, and ‘I’ll be darned, oh my gosh, Jim, you weren't lying, this is a real program and it does really great things in Stockholm!” Doten recalled. He waxed on about the “Stockholm method” for planting urban trees that involves using biochar and which can help manage the flow of stormwater. Stockholm is also sending waste heat from its pyrolysis facility into a district heating system used to warm apartments.
</p><p>
	A few years later, Bloomberg Philanthropies invited other cities to apply for funding to build similar programs. Minneapolis was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/press/bloomberg-philanthropies-announces-mayors-challenge-winning-project-to-combat-climate-change-will-spread-to-seven-global-cities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one of three U.S. cities</u></a>, along with Lincoln, Nebraska, and Cincinnati, Ohio, to win $400,000 in 2022 to develop city-wide biochar projects. All three are expected to begin construction on their production facilities this year; Doten hopes the Minneapolis facility will be operational this fall.
</p><p>
	The city has made an agreement with Xcel Energy, the local utility, to collect the tree clippings from the company’s electrical line maintenance work — previously that material was getting burned in a power plant. Doten has also found a site for the facility — a somewhat isolated industrial property near railroad tracks — which was no easy feat in an urban environment. “It’s very difficult to site a place like this within the city that's not near residences, properly zoned, get the neighborhood approvals, council approvals, and make sure everybody's happy — well I shouldn’t say happy, but at least satisfied with the result.”
</p><p>
	The other big piece was sourcing the equipment. As my colleague Katie Brigham has <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/biochar-carbon-removal-microsoft" target="_self"><u>reported</u></a>, there are <em><em>a lot</em></em> of biochar companies. According to <a href="https://alliedoffsets.com/cdr-data/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>one carbon removal database</u></a>, there are more than 240 such companies around the world — more than any other type of carbon removal company. But most of them have developed fancy pyrolysis machines for their own use, to develop their own carbon removal projects. There aren’t that many offering the technology for sale. Doten said he talked to most of the ones that did, and there was one company whose bid came in far below the rest — BluSky, a small startup based in Connecticut. Minneapolis purchased the company’s equipment, nicknamed the “Vulcan” system, for $585,000.
</p><p>
	“We really believe in what Jim is doing and what the city is doing,” Will Hessert, the company’s CEO, told me. “We want to see more cities doing this.”
</p><p>
	Writing in <em><em>The New Republic</em></em> in 2022, four scholars made a case for a public model for carbon removal. They argued that if the responsibility is left to private companies, it could end up like plastic recycling, which is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/822597631/plastic-wars-three-takeaways-from-the-fight-over-the-future-of-plastics" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>basically a big lie</u></a> and “distracts from underlying causes while pollution continues.” Or it could end up like privately owned electric utilities who take shortcuts that end up costing lives, like how PG&E’s inadequate maintenance led to the 2018 Camp Fire in California.
</p><p>
	“Imagine a regional, community-run carbon removal authority,” they wrote, “that simultaneously pursues wetland restoration and forest management, safely operates an industrial removal facility and associated mining and geological sequestration operations, monitors carbon levels in forests, and works with farmers to maintain healthy fields that store carbon in the soil.”
</p><p>
	That’s not what’s happening in Minneapolis. The climate benefits are likely to be minimal. The city couldn’t provide me with an estimate, but a <a href="https://www.minneapolismn.gov/news/2023/november/biochar/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>story about the project</u></a> from last year noted that the city anticipated having a system that could handle 3,600 tons of wood waste per year, resulting in an estimated 1,500 tons of CO2 removed. That’s about 0.04% of the city’s current annual emissions.
</p><p>
	There is a real opportunity for cities to play a role in carbon removal. A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-024-00069-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>study</u></a> from 2022 found that cities might be able to play a significant role in carbon removal — potentially removing up to 1 billion tons per year, though the numbers are “plagued by uncertainties” — by sequestering carbon in vegetation, soils, and the built environment. In that sense, Minneapolis’ biochar program could be one component of this larger vision.

## P&B: Anton Podviaznikov

date: 2024-07-05, from: Manu - I write blog


                <p>This is the 45th edition of <em>People and Blogs</em>, the series where I ask interesting people to talk about themselves and their blogs. Today we have Anton Podviaznikov and his blog, <a href="https://podviaznikov.com">podviaznikov.com</a></p>
<p>To follow this series <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com">subscribe to the newsletter</a>. A new interview will land in your inbox every Friday. Not a fan of newsletters? No problem! You can read the interviews here on the blog or you can subscribe to the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/feed">RSS feed</a>.</p>
<p>If you're enjoying the People and Blogs series and you want to see it grow, consider supporting on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/manuelmoreale">Ko-Fi</a>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Let's start from the basics: can you introduce yourself?</h2>
<p>I’m originally from Ukraine, I grew up there and finished university. Moved out in 2010 to explore the world. Since 2014 US was my home base.</p>
<p>I’m software engineer by trade. It was my education and first I worked as a programmer because it was my career choice. But sometime around 2011 I fell in love with the web and programming. I worked at several startups and few bigger tech companies and also created countless side projects.</p>
<h2>What's the story behind your blog?</h2>
<p>I created my personal site around 2013. It is 10+ years old. I think I created it during the period when I was falling in love with programming and ideas behind web and the Internet. I got exposed to them way later in my life than people who grew up in Western Europe or US. I had a lot of personal revelations at that time in my life.</p>
<h2>What does your creative process look like when it comes to blogging?</h2>
<p>Super simple. I discovered that writing feels “painful” for me. I really do struggle. The only way that works for me is to remove editing part and also write in the “stream of consciousness style”. I write stuff in one go. I write some essay in Apple Notes and it gets published automatically to my site while I’m writing it. I might reread it some time later and edit few things - but usually I don’t do that and just discover some typos years later.</p>
<p>Another important thing is that I mostly write on topics I don’t want to think anymore. Writing is the final step of thinking over something for me. I write down about some topic, publish it and then don’t think about that again for a while.</p>
<h2>Do you have an ideal creative environment? Also do you believe the physical space influences your creativity?</h2>
<p>I wrote decent amount of essays on airplanes and trains. They are uncomfortable physically, but I found them to be a great time to write and to speed up the travel, Internet is flaky and I have space to reflect. I also like to write(and program) in coffeeshops. I like noise and I can usually fully block it out.</p>
<h2>A question for the techie readers: can you run us through your tech stack?</h2>
<p>I’m software engineer. I always made custom stacks for my personal site. For the past 2 years my website is powered by a small tool I made. It’s a tool that publishes Apple Notes to my site. It’s called Montaigne.</p>
<h2>Given your experience, if you were to start a blog today, would you do anything differently?</h2>
<p>I want to say: start even earlier. But that is also difficult because I do feel that I didn’t have much to say before I was 25 yo and also I didn’t discover my “voice”. But I think trying writing helps to discover that voice.</p>
<p>Write as often as you can. If it’s 5 essays per year - it’s still good. I collected many over the years and sometimes I open some and read and get surprised with some insights I got. It’s a very interesting feeling. </p>
<p>I feel like even now I don’t capture most of the insights I have during the year. So writing more is always a good advice.</p>
<h2>Financial question since the web is obsessed with money: how much does it cost to run your blog? Is it just a cost or does it generate some revenue? And what's your position on people monetising personal blogs?</h2>
<p>I think people should do what they feel is good for them. If you are in the position where you want/need to monetize - do that. If money is not critical, do not do it. Eg write for yourself first. On top of that there might be some second order unpredictable benefits to writing. Eg someone would reach out to you and would offer a job or collaboration. This is way better than money(if you don’t need them).</p>
<p>Hard to say how much does it cost to run my site since it runs using the tool that I made. But for other people this tool is free:)</p>
<h2>Time for some recommendations: any blog you think is worth checking out? And also, who do you think I should be interviewing next?</h2>

## What NATO Countries and Other U.S. Allies Contribute to the Collective Defense

date: 2024-07-05, updated: 2024-07-05, from: RAND blog

NATO countries pledge to spend 2 percent of their economies on defense and over half are on track to hit that target this year. But that 2 percent number has never been a great metric. A new country-by-country index shows in detail what allies can actually bring to the table in time of war.
