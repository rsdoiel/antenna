[Microsoft] said it plans in 2025 “to invest approximately $80 billion
to build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and
cloud-based applications around the world.”
</p>
<p>
For comparison, the James Webb telescope cost $10bn, so Microsoft is
spending eight James Webb telescopes in one year just on AI.
</p>
<p>
For a further comparison, people think the long-in-development ITER
fusion reactor will cost between $40bn and $70bn once developed (and
it’s shaping up to be a 20-30 year project), so Microsoft is spending
more than the sum total of humanity’s biggest fusion bet <em>in one
year</em> on AI.

In the modern day Windows is a power house, but that wasn’t always the
case. In this episode we are looking at the fraught development of
Windows 1.0. During development it was called vaporware, it was panned
in the press, roasted at at least one trade show, and even called…
“eclectic”. Through it all a vision in lime green would take form.

Downloading every video for a TikTok account</a></strong>
</p>
<p>TikTok may or may not be banned in the USA within the next 24 hours
or so. I figured out a gnarly pattern for downloading every video from a
specified account, using browser console JavaScript to scrape the video
URLs and <a href="https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp">yt-dlp</a> to fetch
each video. As a bonus, I included a recipe for generating a Whisper
transcript of every video with
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/mlx-whisper/">mlx-whisper</a> and a
hacky way to show a progress bar for the downloads.</p>
