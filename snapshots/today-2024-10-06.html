hackers breached US court wiretap systems, WSJ reports</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Reuters — Chinese hackers accessed the networks of U.S. broadband
providers and obtained information from systems the federal government
uses for court-authorized wiretapping, The Wall Street Journal reported
Saturday.</p>
<p>Verizon Communications, AT&amp;T and Lumen Technologies are among the
telecoms companies whose networks were breached by the recently
discovered intrusion, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with
the matter.</p>
<p>The hackers might have held access for months to network
infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorized
U.S. requests for communications data, the Journal said. It added that
the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic.</p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry responded Sunday that it was not aware of
the attack described in the report but said the United States had
“concocted a false narrative” to “frame” China in the past.</p>
<p>“At a time when cybersecurity has become a common challenge for all
countries around the world, this erroneous approach will only hinder the
efforts of the international community to jointly address the challenge
through dialog and cooperation,” the ministry said in a statement to
Reuters.</p>
<p>Beijing has previously denied claims by the U.S. government and
others that it has used hackers to break into foreign computer
systems.</p>
<p>Lumen Technologies declined to comment, while Verizon and AT&amp;T
did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The Journal said the attack was carried out by a Chinese hacking
group with the aim of collecting intelligence. U.S. investigators have
dubbed it “Salt Typhoon.”</p>
<p>Earlier this year, U.S. law enforcement disrupted a major Chinese
hacking group nicknamed “Flax Typhoon,” months after confronting Beijing
about sweeping cyber espionage under a campaign named “Volt
Typhoon.”</p>
<p>China’s foreign ministry said in its statement that Beijing’s
cybersecurity agencies had found and published evidence to show Volt
Typhoon was staged by “an international ransomware organization.”</p>

id="tropical-storm-milton-could-hit-florida-as-a-major-hurricane-midweek">Tropical
Storm Milton could hit Florida as a major hurricane midweek</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>miami — People across Florida were given notice Sunday that Milton,
for now just a tropical storm off the coast of Mexico, could intensify
rapidly into a major hurricane before slamming midweek into the
storm-ravaged Gulf Coast. </p>
<p>Tropical Storm Milton’s center was about 1,385 kilometers
west-southwest of Tampa, Florida, early Sunday, heading east at 7 kph
with maximum sustained winds of 95 kph, the National Hurricane Center in
Miami said. </p>
<p>“Milton is moving slowly but is expected to strengthen rapidly,” the
center said. “There is increasing confidence that a powerful hurricane
with life-threatening hazards will be affecting portions of the Florida
west coast around the middle of this week.” </p>
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that while it remains to be
seen just where Milton will strike, it’s clear that Florida is going to
be hit hard — “I don’t think there’s any scenario where we don’t have
major impacts at this point.” </p>
<p>“You have time to prepare — all day today, all day Monday, probably
all day Tuesday to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in
place,” the governor said. “Know your evacuation zone — there will be
mandatory and voluntary evacuations.” </p>
<p>DeSantis said as many as 4,000 National Guard troops are helping the
Florida Division of Emergency Management and the Florida Department of
Transportation to remove debris, and he declared a state of emergency in
35 counties ahead of Milton. He said Floridians should prepare for more
power outages and disruption. </p>
<p>“All available state assets … are being marshaled to help remove
debris,” DeSantis said. “We’re going 24-7 … it’s all hands on
deck.” </p>
<p>FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell defended her agency’s response to
the destruction wrought by Hurricane Helene after Republicans’ false
claims, amplified by former President Donald Trump, created a frenzy of
misinformation across devastated communities. </p>
<p>“This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people and it’s really a
shame we’re putting politics ahead of helping people,” Criswell told
ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. It’s created fear and mistrust among
residents against the thousands of FEMA employees and volunteers on the
ground across the southeast, she said. </p>
<p>Despite this, Criswell said the agency is already preparing for
Milton, well before it’s clear exactly where it will move across the
Florida peninsula this week. “We’re working with the state there to
understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those
in place before it makes landfall,” she said. </p>
<p>The hurricane center said Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula, the Florida
Peninsula, the Florida Keys and the northwestern Bahamas should monitor
the system’s progress. Heavy rainfall was expected Sunday ahead of the
storm itself, and will likely then combine with Milton’s rainfall to
flood waterways and streets in Florida, where forecasters said up to 30
centimeters of rain could fall in places through Wednesday night. </p>
<p>“There is an increasing risk of life-threatening storm surge and wind
impacts for portions of the west coast of the Florida Peninsula
beginning late Tuesday or Wednesday. Residents in these areas should
ensure they have their hurricane plan in place, follow any advice given
by local officials, and check back for updates to the forecast,” the
center said. </p>
<p>The Atlantic hurricane season has become more active as rescuers in
the U.S. Southeast continue to search for people unaccounted for in the
wake of Hurricane Helene, which left a huge trail of death and
catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains. </p>
<p>Hurricane Kirk diminished to a Category 2 hurricane in the open
Atlantic early, with top winds of 165 kph, sending large swells and
“life-threatening surf and rip current conditions” to Bermuda and
northward along the U.S. and Canadian coasts, the center said. Hurricane
Leslie also was moving northwest over the open Atlantic, with top winds
of 140 kph but posing no threats to land.</p>

id="as-affordable-housing-disappears-states-scramble-to-shore-up-the-losses">As
affordable housing disappears, states scramble to shore up the
losses</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Los Angeles — For more than two decades, the low rent on Marina
Maalouf’s apartment in a blocky affordable housing development in Los
Angeles’ Chinatown was a saving grace for her family, including a
granddaughter who has autism.</p>
<p>But that grace had an expiration date. For Maalouf and her family it
arrived in 2020.</p>
<p>The landlord, no longer legally obligated to keep the building
affordable, hiked rent from $1,100 to $2,660 in 2021 — out of reach for
Maalouf and her family. Maalouf’s nights are haunted by fears her
yearslong eviction battle will end in sleeping bags on a friend’s floor
or worse.</p>
<p>While Americans continue to struggle under unrelentingly high rents,
as many as 223,0000 affordable housing units like Maalouf’s across the
U.S. could be yanked out from under them in the next five years
alone.</p>
<p>It leaves low-income tenants caught facing protracted eviction
battles, scrambling to pay a two-fold rent increase or more, or shunted
back into a housing market where costs can easily eat half a
paycheck.</p>
<p>Those affordable housing units were built with the Low-Income Housing
Tax Credit, or LIHTC, a federal program established in 1986 that
provides tax credits to developers in exchange for keeping rents low. It
has pumped out 3.6 million units since then and boasts over half of all
federally supported low-income housing nationwide.</p>
<p>“It’s the lifeblood of affordable housing development,” said Brian
Rossbert, who runs Housing Colorado, an organization advocating for
affordable homes.</p>
<p>That lifeblood isn’t strictly red or blue. By combining social
benefits with tax breaks and private ownership, LIHTC has enjoyed
bipartisan support. Its expansion is now central to Democratic
presidential candidate Kamala Harris’ housing plan to build 3 million
new homes.</p>
<p>The catch? The buildings typically only need to be kept affordable
for a minimum of 30 years. For the wave of LIHTC construction in the
1990s, those deadlines are arriving now, threatening to hemorrhage
affordable housing supply when Americans need it most.</p>
<p>“If we are losing the homes that are currently affordable and
available to households, then we’re losing ground on the crisis,” said
Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy at the National Low
Income Housing Coalition.</p>
<p>“It’s sort of like having a boat with a hole at the bottom,” she
said.</p>
<p>Not all units that expire out of LIHTC become market rate. Some are
kept affordable by other government subsidies, by merciful landlords or
by states, including California, Colorado and New York, that have worked
to keep them low-cost by relying on several levers.</p>
<p>Local governments and nonprofits can purchase expiring apartments,
new tax credits can be applied that extend the affordability, or, as in
Maalouf’s case, tenants can organize to try to force action from
landlords and city officials.</p>
<p>Those options face challenges. While new tax credits can reup a
lapsing LIHTC property, they are limited, doled out to states by the
Internal Revenue Service based on population. It’s also a tall order for
local governments and nonprofits to shell out enough money to purchase
and keep expiring developments affordable. And there is little
aggregated data on exactly when LIHTC units will lose their
affordability, making it difficult for policymakers and activists to
fully prepare.</p>
<p>There also is less of a political incentive to preserve the
units.</p>
<p>“Politically, you’re rewarded for an announcement, a groundbreaking,
a ribbon-cutting,” said Vicki Been, a New York University professor who
previously was New York City’s deputy mayor for housing and economic
development.</p>
<p>“You’re not rewarded for being a good manager of your assets and
keeping track of everything and making sure that you’re not losing a
single affordable housing unit,” she said.</p>
<p>Maalouf stood in her apartment courtyard on a recent warm day,
chit-chatting and waving to neighbors, a bracelet with a photo of Che
Guevarra dangling from her arm.</p>
<p>“Friendly,” is how Maalouf described her previous self, but not
assertive. That is until the rent hikes pushed her in front of the Los
Angeles City Council for the first time, sweat beading as she fought for
her home.</p>
<p>Now an organizer with the LA Tenants’ Union, Maalouf isn’t afraid to
speak up, but the angst over her home still keeps her up at night.
Mornings she repeats a mantra: “We still here. We still here.” But
fighting day after day to make it true is exhausting.</p>
<p>Maalouf’s apartment was built before California made LIHTC contracts
last 55 years instead of 30 in 1996. About 5,700 LIHTC units built
around the time of Maalouf’s are expiring in the next decade. In Texas,
it’s 21,000 units.</p>
<p>When California Treasurer Fiona Ma assumed office in 2019, she
steered the program toward developers committed to affordable housing
and not what she called “churn and burn,” buying up LIHTC properties and
flipping them onto the market as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In California, landlords must notify state and local governments and
tenants before their building expires. Housing organizations,
nonprofits, and state or local governments then have first shot at
buying the property to keep it affordable. Expiring developments also
are prioritized for new tax credits, and the state essentially requires
that all LIHTC applicants have experience owning and managing affordable
housing.</p>
<p>“It kind of weeded out people who weren’t interested in affordable
housing long term,” said Marina Wiant, executive director of
California’s tax credit allocation committee.</p>
<p>But unlike California, some states haven’t extended LIHTC agreements
beyond 30 years, let alone taken other measures to keep expiring housing
affordable.</p>
<p>Colorado, which has some 80,000 LIHTC units, passed a law this year
giving local governments the right of first refusal in hopes of
preserving 4,400 units set to lose affordability protections in the next
six years. The law also requires landlords to give local and state
governments a two-year heads-up before expiration.</p>
<p>Still, local governments or nonprofits scraping together the funds to
buy sizeable apartment buildings is far from a guarantee.</p>
<p>Stories like Maalouf’s will keep playing out as LIHTC units turn
over, threatening to send families with meager means back into the
housing market. The median income of Americans living in these units was
just $18,600 in 2021, according to the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.</p>
<p>“This is like a math problem,” said Rossbert of Housing Colorado. “As
soon as one of these units expires and converts to market rate and a
household is displaced, they become a part of the need that’s driving
the need for new construction.”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to get out of that cycle,” he said.</p>
<p>Colorado’s housing agency works with groups across the state on
preservation and has a fund to help. Still, it’s unclear how many LIHTC
units can be saved, in Colorado or across the country.</p>
<p>It’s even hard to know how many units nationwide are expiring. An
accurate accounting would require sorting through the constellation of
municipal, state and federal subsidies, each with their own
affordability requirements and end dates.</p>
<p>That can throw a wrench into policymakers’ and advocates’ ability to
fully understand where and when many units will lose affordability, and
then funnel resources to the right places, said Kelly McElwain, who
manages and oversees the National Housing Preservation Database. It’s
the most comprehensive aggregation of LIHTC data nationally, but with
all the gaps, it remains a rough estimate.</p>
<p>There also are fears that if states publicize their expiring LIHTC
units, for-profit buyers without an interest in keeping them affordable
would pounce.</p>
<p>“It’s sort of this Catch-22 of trying to both understand the problem
and not put out a big for-sale sign in front of a property right before
its expiration,” Rossbert said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Maalouf’s tenant activism has helped move the needle in
Los Angeles. The city has offered the landlord $15 million to keep her
building affordable through 2034, but that deal wouldn’t get rid of over
30 eviction cases still proceeding, including Maalouf’s, or the $25,000
in back rent she owes.</p>
<p>In her courtyard, Maalouf’s granddaughter, Rubie Caceres, shuffled up
with a glass of water. She is 5 years old, but with special needs, her
speech is more disconnected words than sentences.</p>
<p>“That’s why I’ve been hoping everything becomes normal again, and she
can be safe,” said Maalouf, her voice shaking with emotion. She has
urged her son to start saving money for the worst.</p>
<p>“We’ll keep fighting,” she said, “but day by day it’s hard.”</p>

id="grammys-revamped-voting-body-is-more-diverse-with-66-new-members">Grammys’
revamped voting body is more diverse, with 66% new members</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — For years, the Grammy Awards have been criticized over a
lack of diversity — artists of color and women left out of top prizes;
rap and contemporary R&amp;B stars ignored — a reflection of the
Recording Academy’s electorate. An evolving voting body, 66% of whom
have joined in the last five years, is working to remedy that.</p>
<p>At last year’s awards, women dominated the major categories; every
televised competitive Grammy went to at least one woman. It stems from a
commitment the Recording Academy made five years ago: In 2019, the
Academy announced it would add 2,500 women to its voting body by 2025.
Under the Grammys’ new membership model, the Recording Academy has
surpassed that figure ahead of the deadline: More than 3,000 female
voting members have been added, it announced Thursday.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely something that we’re all very proud of,” Harvey
Mason jr., academy president and CEO, told The Associated Press. “It
tells me that we were severely underrepresented in that area.”</p>
<p>Reform at the Record Academy dates back to the creation of a task
force focused on inclusion and diversity after a previous CEO, Neil
Portnow, made comments belittling women at the height of the #MeToo
movement.</p>
<p>Since 2019, approximately 8,700 new members have been added to the
voting body. In total, there are now more than 16,000 members and more
than 13,000 of them are voting members, up from about 14,000 in 2023
(11,000 of which were voting members). In that time, the academy has
increased its number of members who identify as people of color by
63%.</p>
<p>“It’s not an all-new voting body,” Mason assures. “We’re very
specific and intentional in who we asked to be a part of our academy by
listening and learning from different genres and different groups that
felt like they were being overlooked, or they weren’t being heard.”</p>
<p>Mason says that in the last five years, the Recording Academy has
“requalified 100% of our members, which is a huge step.” There are
voters who have let their membership lapse — and those who no longer
qualify to be a voting member have been removed.</p>
<p>There have been renewal review processes in the past, but under the
current model, becoming a voting member requires proof of a primary
career in music, two recommendations from industry peers and 12 credits
in a single creative profession, at least five of which must be from the
last five years.</p>
<p>Comparisons might be made to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences, which announced in 2016 that it would restrict Oscars voting
privileges to active members — ineligible parties included those who
haven’t worked in three decades since joining the Academy, unless they
themselves are nominated — as a response to #OscarsSoWhite criticisms of
its lack of diversity. As a result, some members protested that the new
measures unjustly scapegoated older academy members. The film academy
has also grown its membership, adding more women and people from
underrepresented racial and ethnic communities.</p>
<p>The Recording Academy sought to increase its voting body by reaching
out to different, underrepresented communities, says Mason. “Let’s take
the time to understand why those people aren’t engaging with us, figure
out how we can fix that,” he said. “And once we fixed it, then let’s
invite them or ask them if they would like to be a part of our
organization. So, it was a multi-step process.”</p>
<p>Since 2019, the Recording Academy has also seen growth in voters
across different racial backgrounds: 100% growth in AAPI voters, 90%
growth in Black voters and 43% growth in Latino voters.</p>
<p>Still, Mason sees room to grow. Of the current voting membership, 66%
are men, 49% are white and 66% are over the age of 40.</p>
<p>“Going forward, we’re going to continue the work. We’re going to
continue to grow,” he says.</p>
<p>That might not look like a public commitment to a specific figure,
but Mason promises “that our goals will be to be the most relevant, the
most reflective, the most accurately representative of the music
community that is humanly possible.”</p>

id="trump-points-to-new-numbers-on-migrants-with-criminal-pasts.-heres-what-they-show">Trump
points to new numbers on migrants with criminal pasts. Here’s what they
show</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Republicans are pointing to newly released immigration
enforcement data to bolster their argument that the Biden administration
is letting migrants who have committed serious crimes go free in the
U.S. But the numbers have been misconstrued without key context.</p>
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement released data to Republican
Rep. Tony Gonzales in response to a request he made for information
about people under ICE supervision either convicted of crimes or facing
criminal charges. Gonzales’ Texas district includes an 800-mile stretch
bordering Mexico.</p>
<p>Gonzales posted the numbers online and they immediately became a
flashpoint in the presidential campaign between former President Donald
Trump, who has vowed to carry out mass deportations, and Vice President
Kamala Harris. Immigration — and the Biden administration’s record on
border security — has become a key issue in the election.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at the data and what it does or doesn’t show:</p>
<p>What are the numbers? As of July 21, ICE said 662,556 people under
its supervision were either convicted of crimes or face criminal
charges. Nearly 15,000 were in its custody, but the vast majority —
647,572 — were not.</p>
<p>Included in the figures of people not detained by ICE were people
found guilty of very serious crimes: 13,099 for homicide, 15,811 for
sexual assault, 13,423 for weapons offenses and 2,663 for stolen
vehicles. The single biggest category was for traffic-related offenses
at 77,074, followed by assault at 62,231 and dangerous drugs at
56,533.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, later
clarified that the numbers span decades — including the Trump
administration and other presidencies — and that those not in its
custody may be detained by a state or local agency. It’s a distinction
ICE didn’t make in its report to Gonzales.</p>
<p>“When we speak of somebody who is not detained, we mean not detained
in ICE custody. The individual could be in Folsom State Prison, for
example,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said
Monday.</p>
<p>Millions of people are on ICE’s “non-detained docket,” or people
under the agency’s supervision who aren’t in its custody. Many are
awaiting outcomes of their cases in immigration court, including some
wearing monitoring devices. Others have been released after completing
their prison sentences because their countries won’t take them back.</p>
<p>What do both sides say about the numbers? Republicans pointed to the
data as proof that the Biden administration is letting immigrants with
criminal records into the country and isn’t doing enough to kick out
those who commit crimes while they’re here.</p>
<p>“The truth is clear — illegal immigrants with a criminal record are
coming into our country. The data released by ICE is beyond disturbing,
and it should be a wake-up call for the Biden-Harris administration and
cities across the country that hide behind sanctuary policies,” Gonzales
said in a news release, referring to pledges by local officials to limit
their cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>
<p>Trump, who has repeatedly portrayed immigrants as bringing
lawlessness and crime to America, tweeted multiple screenshots of the
data with the words: “13,000 CROSSED THE BORDER WITH MURDER
CONVICTIONS.”</p>
<p>He also asserted that the numbers correspond to Biden and Harris’
time in office.</p>
<p>The data was being misinterpreted, Homeland Security said in a
statement Sunday.</p>
<p>“The data goes back decades; it includes individuals who entered the
country over the past 40 years or more, the vast majority of whose
custody determination was made long before this Administration,” the
agency said. “It also includes many who are under the jurisdiction or
currently incarcerated by federal, state or local law enforcement
partners.”</p>
<p>Mayorkas said it was “unfortunate” the information didn’t come with
proper explanation, saying that “lends itself to misinterpretation,
either deliberate or otherwise.”</p>
<p>The department also stressed what it has done to deport those without
the right to stay in America, saying it had removed or returned more
than 700,000 people in the past year, which it said was the highest
number since 2010. Homeland Security said it had removed 180,000 people
with criminal convictions since President Joe Biden took office.</p>
<p>What’s behind the figures? The data isn’t only listing people who
entered the country during the Biden administration but includes people
going back decades who came during previous administrations, said Doris
Meissner, former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which was the predecessor to ICE.</p>
<p>They’re accused or convicted of committing crimes in America as
opposed to committing crimes in other countries and then entering the
U.S., said Meissner, who is now director of the U.S. Immigration Policy
Program at the Migration Policy Institute.</p>
<p>“This is not something that is a function of what the Biden
administration did,” she said. “Certainly, this includes the Biden
years, but this is an accumulation of many years, and certainly going
back to at least 2010, 2011, 2012.”</p>
<p>A 2017 report by Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General says
that as of August 2016, ICE had about 368,574 people on its non-detained
docket who were convicted criminals. By June 2021, shortly after Trump
left office, that number was up to 405,786.</p>
<p>Can’t ICE just deport criminals? ICE has limited resources. The
number of people it supervises has skyrocketed, while its staffing has
not. As the agency noted in a 2023 end-of-year report, it often has to
send staff to help at the border, taking them away from their normal
duties.</p>
<p>The number of people ICE supervises but who aren’t in its custody has
grown from 3.3 million a little before Biden took office to a little
over 7 million last spring.</p>
<p>“The simple answer is that as a system, we haven’t devoted enough
resources to the parts of the government that deal with monitoring and
ultimately removing people who are deportable,” Meissner said.</p>
<p>ICE also has logistical and legal limits on who they can hold. Its
budget allows the agency to hold 41,500 people at a time. John Sandweg,
who was acting ICE director from 2013 to 2014 under then-President
Barack Obama, said holding people accused or convicted of the most
serious crimes is always the top priority.</p>
<p>But once someone has a final order of removal — meaning a court has
found that they don’t have the right to stay in the country — they
cannot be held in detention forever while ICE works out how to get them
home. A 2001 Supreme Court ruling essentially prevented ICE from holding
those people for more than six months if there is no reasonable chance
to expect they can be sent back.</p>
<p>Not every country is willing to take back their citizens, Sandweg
said.</p>
<p>He said he suspects that a large number of those convicted of
homicide but not held by ICE are people who were ordered deported but
the agency can’t remove them because their home country won’t take them
back.</p>
<p>“It’s a very common scenario. Even amongst the countries that take
people back, they can be very selective about who they take back,” he
said.</p>
<p>The U.S. also could run into problems deporting people to countries
with which it has tepid relations.</p>
<p>Homeland Security did not respond to questions about how many
countries won’t take back their citizens. The 2017 watchdog report put
the number at 23 countries, plus an additional 62 that were cooperative
but where there were delays getting things like passports or travel
documents.</p>

returns to site of first assassination attempt for campaign rally</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-06, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BUTLER, Pennsylvania — Donald Trump returned on Saturday to the
Pennsylvania fairgrounds where he was nearly assassinated in July,
holding a sprawling rally before a massive crowd in a critical swing
state Trump hopes to return to his column in November’s election.</p>
<p>The former president and Republican nominee picked up where he left
off in July when a gunman tried to assassinate him and struck his ear.
He began his speech with, “As I was saying,” and gestured toward an
immigration chart he was looking at when the gunfire began.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign worked to maximize the event’s headline-grabbing
potential with just 30 days to go and voting already underway in some
states in his race against his Democratic opponent, Vice President
Kamala Harris. Musician Lee Greenwood appeared on stage and serenaded
him with God Bless the USA, frequently played at his rallies, and
billionaire Elon Musk spoke for the first time at a Trump rally.</p>
<p>“We fought together. We have endured together. We have pushed onward
together,” Trump said. “And right here in Pennsylvania, we have bled
together. We’ve bled.”</p>
<p>‘This is a must-win’</p>
<p>Trump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds
like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community,
if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted
her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part
of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the rally, Trump asked for a moment of silence to
honor firefighter Corey Comperatore, who died as he shielded family
members from gunfire. Opera singer Christopher Macchio sang Ave Maria
after a bell rung at the same time that gunfire began on July 13.</p>
<p>Standing behind protective glass that now encases the stage at his
outdoor rallies, Trump called the would-be assassin “a vicious monster”
and said he did not succeed “by the hand of providence and the grace of
God.” There was a very visible heightened security presence, with armed
law enforcers in camouflage uniforms on roofs.</p>
<p>One of the most anticipated guests of the evening was Musk, who
climbed onto the stage on Saturday jumping and pumping his fists in the
air after Trump introduced him as a “great gentleman” and said he “saved
free speech.”</p>
<p>“President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win
to preserve democracy in America,” said Musk, who endorsed Trump after
the assassination attempt. “This is a must-win situation.”</p>
<p>Musk, who bought Twitter and rebranded it as X and has embraced
conservative politics, met with Trump and Vance backstage, donning a
black “Make America Great Again” hat. A billboard on the way into the
rally said, “IN MUSK WE TRUST,” and showed his photo.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, Trump’s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, got
on stage and reflected on the events that day while criticizing
Democrats for calling Trump “a threat to democracy,” saying that kind of
language is “inflammatory.”</p>
<p>“You heard the shots. You saw the blood. We all feared the worst. But
you knew everything would be OK when President Trump raised his fist
high in the air and shouted, ‘Fight, fight!’” said Vance. “Now I believe
it as sure as I’m standing here today that what happened was a true
miracle.”</p>
<p>Crowds pack stands</p>
<p>Crowds were lined up as the sun rose Saturday. The crowd packed
bleachers, folding chairs and the field stretching to the venue’s edges.
Area hotels, motels and inns were said to be full and some rallygoers
arrived Friday.</p>
<p>Much of the crowd waited several hours for Trump. About half an hour
into his speech, Trump paused his speech for more than five minutes
after an attendee had a medical issue and needed a medic.</p>
<p>Trump used the event to remember Comperatore, the volunteer
firefighter struck and killed at the July 13 rally, and to recognize the
two other rallygoers injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They and
Trump were struck when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks of
Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, opened fire from an unsecured rooftop nearby
before he was fatally shot by sharpshooters.</p>
<p>The building from which Crooks fired was completely obscured by
tractor-trailers, a large grassy perimeter and a fence. Most bleachers
were now at the sides, rather than behind Trump.</p>
<p>How Crooks managed to outmaneuver law enforcement that day and
scramble on top of a building within easy shooting distance of the
ex-president is among many questions that remain unanswered about the
worst Secret Service security failure in decades. Another is his
motive.</p>
<p>Butler County District Attorney Rich Goldinger told WPXI-TV this week
that “everyone is doubling down on their efforts to make sure this is
done safely and correctly.”</p>
<p>Mike Slupe, the county sheriff, told the station he estimates the
Secret Service, was deploying “quadruple the assets” it did in July. The
agency has undergone a painful reckoning over its handling of two
attempts on Trump’s life.</p>
<p>‘I believe God’s got Trump’</p>
<p>Butler County, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing
state, is a Trump stronghold. He won the county with about 66% of the
vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57% of the county’s 139,000 registered
voters are Republicans, compared with about 29% who are Democrats and
14% something else.</p>
<p>Chris Harpster, 30, of Tyrone, Pennsylvania, was accompanied by his
girlfriend on Saturday as he returned to the scene. Of July 13, he said,
“I was afraid” — as were his parents, watching at home, who texted him
immediately after the shots rang out.</p>
<p>Heightened security measures were making him feel better now, as well
as the presence of his girlfriend, a first-time rallygoer. Harpster said
he will be a third-time Trump voter in November, based on the Republican
nominee’s stances on immigration, guns, abortion and energy. Harpster
said he hopes Pennsylvania will go Republican, particularly out of
concern over gas and oil industry jobs.</p>
<p>Other townspeople were divided over the value of Trump’s return.
Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting
Harris, said Trump’s last visit fanned political tensions in the
city.</p>
<p>“Whenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him
being here, it scares the people who don’t want to see him reelected,”
she said.</p>
<p>Terri Palmquist came from Bakersfield, California, and said her
18-year-old daughter tried to dissuade her. “I just figure we need to
not let fear control us. That’s what the other side wants is fear. If
fear controls us, we lose,” she said.</p>
<p>She said she was not worried about her own safety.</p>
<p>“Honesty, I believe God’s got Trump, for some reason. I do. So we’re
rooting for him.”</p>

“is going to be more active in digital advertising”</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: OS News</p>
<p>In ancient Greek mythology, Kassandra, priestess of Apollo and
daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy, was granted the gift of
prophecy by Apollo, in return for “favours”. When Kassandra then decided
to, well, not grant any “favours”, Apollo showcased that as a good son
of Zeus, he did not understand consent either, and cursed her by making
sure nobody would believe her prophecies. There’s some variations to the
story from one author or source to the next, but the general gist
remains the same. Anyway, I’ve been warning everyone about the fall of
Mozilla and Firefox for years now, so here’s another chapter in the slow
decline and fall of Mozilla: they’re now just flat-out stating they’re
an online advertising company. As Mark shared in his blog, Mozilla is
going to be more active in digital advertising. Our hypothesis is that
we need to simultaneously work on public policy, standards, products and
infrastructure. Today, I want to take a moment to dive into the details
of the “product” and “infrastructure” elements. I will share our
emerging thoughts on how this will come to life across our existing
products (like Firefox), and across the industry (through the work of
our recent acquisition, Anonym, which is building an alternative
infrastructure for the advertising industry). ↫ Laura Chambers Pretty
much every one of my predictions regarding the slow downfall of Mozilla
are coming true, and we’re just waiting around now for the sword of
Damocles to drop: Google ending its funding for Mozilla, which currently
makes up about 80% of the former browser maker’s revenue. Once this
stream of free money dries up, Mozilla’s decline will only accelerate
even more, and this is probably why they are trying to get into the
online advertising business in the first place. How else are you going
to make money from a browser? In the meantime, the operating system most
reliant on Firefox existing as a privacy-respecting browser, desktop
Linux, still seems to be taking no serious steps to prepare for this
seeming inevitability. There’s no proper Firefox fork, there’s no
Chromium variant with the kind of features desktop users expect (tab
sharing, accounts, etc., which are not part of Chromium), nothing.
There’s going to be a point where shipping a further enshittified
Firefox becomes impossible, or at the least highly contentious, for
Linux distributions, and I don’t see any viable alternative anywhere on
the horizon. I’m sure things will turn out just fine.</p>

id="hacks-against-us-campaign-latest-examples-of-iran-targeting-adversaries">Hacks
against US campaign latest examples of Iran targeting adversaries</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran has emerged as a twofold concern
for the United States as it nears the end of the presidential
campaign. </p>
<p>Prosecutors allege Tehran tried to hack figures associated with the
election, stealing information from former President Donald Trump’s
campaign. And U.S. officials have accused it of plotting to kill Trump
and other ex-officials. </p>
<p>For Iran, assassination plots and hacking aren’t new strategies. </p>
<p>Iran saw the value and the danger of hacking in the early 2000s, when
the Stuxnet virus, believed to have been deployed by Israel and the
U.S., tried to damage Iran’s nuclear program. Since then, hackers
attributed to state-linked operations have targeted the Trump campaign,
Iranian expatriates and government officials at home. </p>
<p>Its history of assassinations goes back further. After the 1979
Islamic Revolution, Iran killed or abducted perceived enemies living
abroad. </p>
<p>A history of hacks </p>
<p>For many, Iran’s behavior can be traced to the emergence of the
Stuxnet computer virus. Released in the 2000s, Stuxnet wormed its way
into control units for uranium-enriching centrifuges at Iran’s Natanz
nuclear facility, causing them to speed up, ultimately destroying
themselves. </p>
<p>Iranian scientists initially believed mechanical errors caused the
damage. Ultimately though, Iran removed the affected equipment and
sought its own way of striking enemies online. </p>
<p>“Iran had an excellent teacher in the emerging art of cyberwarfare,”
noted a 2020 report from the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic
Studies in Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>That was acknowledged by the National Security Agency in a document
leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2015 to The Intercept,
which examined a cyberattack that destroyed hard drives at Saudi
Arabia’s state oil company. Iran has been suspected of carrying out that
attack, called Shamoon, in 2012 and again in 2017. </p>
<p>There also were domestic considerations. In 2009, the disputed
reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the Green
Movement protests. Twitter, one source of news from the demonstrations,
found its website defaced by the self-described “Iranian Cyber Army.”
There’s been suspicion that the Revolutionary Guard, a major power base
within Iran’s theocracy, oversaw the “Cyber Army” and other
hackers. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Iran itself has been hacked repeatedly. They include the
mass shutdown of gas stations across Iran, as well as surveillance
cameras at Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison and even state television
broadcasts. </p>
<p>Low costs, high rewards </p>
<p>Iranian hacking attacks, given their low cost and high reward, likely
will continue as Iran faces a tense international environment
surrounding Israel’s conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran’s
enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade levels, and the prospect of
Trump becoming president again. </p>
<p>The growth of 3G and 4G mobile internet services in Iran also made it
easier for the public — and potential hackers — to access the internet.
Iran has more than 50 major universities with computer science or
information technology programs. At least three of Iran’s top schools
are thought to be affiliated with Iran’s Defense Ministry and the Guard,
providing potential hackers for security forces. </p>
<p>Iranian hacking attempts on U.S. targets have included banks and even
a small dam near New York City — attacks American prosecutors linked to
the Guard. </p>
<p>Hacking attempts rely on phishing</p>
<p>While Russia is seen as the biggest foreign threat to U.S. elections,
officials have been concerned about Iran. Its hacking attempts in the
presidential campaign have relied on phishing — sending many misleading
emails in hopes that some recipients will inadvertently provide access
to sensitive information. </p>
<p>Amin Sabeti, a digital security expert who focuses on Iran, said the
tactic works. </p>
<p>“It’s scalable, it’s cheap and you don’t need a skill set because you
just put, I don’t know, five crazy people who are hard line in an office
in Tehran, then send tens of thousands of emails. If they get 10 of
them, it’s enough,” he said. </p>
<p>For Iran, hacks targeting the U.S. offer the prospect of causing
chaos, undermining Trump’s campaign and obtaining secret
information. </p>
<p>“I’ve lost count of how many attempts have been made on my emails and
social media since it’s been going on for over a decade,” said Holly
Dagres, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who once had
her email briefly hacked by Iran. “The Iranians aren’t targeting me
because I have useful information swimming in my inbox or direct
messages. Rather, they hope to use my name and think tank affiliation to
target others and eventually make it up the chain to high-ranking U.S.
government officials who would have useful information and intelligence
related to Iran.” </p>
<p>Iran’s killings, abductions abroad </p>
<p>Iran has vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his
former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the
prominent Revolutionary Guard General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad. </p>
<p>In July, authorities said they learned of an Iranian threat against
Trump and boosted security. Iran has not been linked to the
assassination attempts against Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania. A
Pakistani man who spent time in Iran was recently charged by federal
prosecutors for allegedly plotting to carry out assassinations in the
U.S., including potentially of Trump. </p>
<p>Officials take Iran’s threat seriously given its history of targeting
adversaries. </p>
<p>Even before creating a network of allied militias in the Mideast,
Iran is suspected of targeting opponents abroad, beginning with members
of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s former government. The attention shifted
to perceived opponents of the theocracy, both in the country with the
mass executions of 1988 and abroad. </p>
<p>Outside of Iran, the so-called “chain murders” targeted activists,
journalists and other critics. One prominent incident linked to Iran was
a shooting at a restaurant in Germany that killed three Iranian-Kurdish
figures and a translator. In 1997, a German court implicated Iran’s top
leaders in the shooting, sparking most European Union nations to
withdraw their ambassadors. </p>
<p>Iran’s targeted killings slowed after that, but didn’t stop. U.S.
prosecutors link Iran’s Revolutionary Guard to a 2011 plot to kill the
Saudi ambassador to Washington.</p>

<h2
id="supreme-court-opens-new-term-with-election-disputes-looming">Supreme
Court opens new term with election disputes looming</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — Transgender rights, the regulation of “ghost guns” and
the death penalty highlight the Supreme Court’s election-season term
that begins Monday, with the prospect of the court’s intervention in
voting disputes lurking in the background.</p>
<p>The justices are returning to the bench at a time of waning public
confidence in the court and calls to limit their terms to 18 years that
have wide support, including the backing of Democratic President Joe
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the party’s White House
nominee.</p>
<p>Whether by design or happenstance, the justices are hearing fewer
high-profile cases than they did in recent terms that included
far-reaching decisions by the 6-3 conservative majority on presidential
immunity, abortion, guns and affirmative action.</p>
<p>The lighter schedule would allow them to easily add election cases,
if those make their way to the high court in the run-up to the Nov. 5
election between Republican Donald Trump and Harris, or its immediate
aftermath.</p>
<p>“I think there are legal issues that arise out of the political
process. And so, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that
should be necessary,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told CBS News last
month in an interview to her promote new memoir Lovely One.</p>
<p>The court’s involvement in election disputes might depend on the
closeness of the outcome and whether the justices’ intervention would
tip the outcome, David Cole, the outgoing legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union, said at a recent Washington event.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the court wants to get involved, but it may have to,”
Cole said.</p>
<p>The court turned away multiple challenges from Trump and his allies
to the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Biden. It’s been
nearly a quarter-century since the Supreme Court effectively decided the
2000 presidential election, in which Republican George W. Bush edged
Democrat Al Gore.</p>
<p>When the justices gather Monday morning on a date set by federal law,
they will shake hands with each other as they always do. Just after 10
o’clock, they will emerge from behind freshly cleaned heavy red drapery
and take their seats on the curved mahogany bench, Chief Justice John
Roberts in the center chair and his eight colleagues seated in order of
seniority.</p>
<p>There are likely to be smiles and shared private jokes. But the
friendliness of that moment will not sweep away tensions that have
barely been concealed.</p>
<p>During the summer, two justices, Elena Kagan and Jackson, voiced
support for toughening the new ethics code that so far lacks a means of
enforcement.</p>
<p>The leak to The New York Times of the contents of a memo Roberts
wrote last winter that outlined his approach to the court’s presidential
immunity decision “was nothing short of shocking,” Supreme Court lawyer
Lisa Blatt said last week at a Washington preview of the coming
term.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Politico obtained the draft decision overturning Roe
v. Wade, the landmark abortion case.</p>
<p>“Something does feel broken,” Blatt said. Describing her experience
arguing before the court, she said, some justices “just seem visibly
frustrated.”</p>
<p>Important cases dot the court’s calendar, beginning Tuesday. The
court will take up a challenge to a Biden administration attempt to
regulate hard-to-trace “ghost guns” that had been turning up at crime
scenes in increasing numbers. The Supreme Court jumped into the case
after the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the
regulation.</p>
<p>Last term, conservatives voted 6-3 to strike down a gun regulation
that had banned bump stocks, an accessory that allows some weapons to
fire at a rate comparable to machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the
nation’s deadliest modern mass shooting in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>A day after the guns case, the justices will take up the latest twist
in Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip’s long quest for freedom.
His case is the rare instance in which prosecutors are conceding
mistakes in the trial that led to Glossip’s conviction and death
sentence.</p>
<p>The highest-profile case on the agenda so far is a fight over
transgender rights that is focused on state bans on gender-affirming
care. It probably will be argued in December.</p>
<p>Republican-led states have enacted a variety of restrictions on
health care for transgender people, school sports participation,
bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led
states have extended protections for transgender people. The Supreme
Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new
federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.</p>
<p>The case before the high court involves a law in Tennessee that
restricts puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors.
About half the states have enacted similar restrictions.</p>
<p>Also on tap for the late fall is an appeal from the adult
entertainment industry to overturn a Texas law that requires
pornographic websites to verify the age of their users.</p>
<p>Only about half the court’s calendar for the term has been filled,
and several big cases could be added. Among those is a push by
Republican-led states and conservative legal outlets to further restrict
federal agencies.</p>
<p>The immediate target is the method the Federal Communications
Commission has used to fund telephone service for rural and low-income
people and broadband services for schools and libraries.</p>
<p>The case, which the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court,
could give the justices the opportunity to revive a legal doctrine known
as nondelegation that has not been used to strike down legislation in
nearly 90 years. Several conservative justices have expressed support
for the idea of limiting the authority Congress can delegate to federal
agencies.</p>

week after Helene hit, thousands still without water struggle to find
enough</h2>
<p>date: 2024-10-05, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — Nearly a week after Hurricane Helene
brought devastation to western North Carolina, a shiny stainless steel
tanker truck in downtown Asheville attracted residents carrying 19-liter
containers, milk jugs and buckets to fill with what has become a
desperately scare resource — drinking water.</p>
<p>Flooding tore through the city’s water system, destroying so much
infrastructure that officials said repairs could take weeks. To make do,
Anna Ramsey arrived Wednesday with her two children, who each left
carrying plastic bags filled with 7.6 liters of water.</p>
<p>“We have no water. We have no power. But I think it’s also been
humbling,” Ramsey said.</p>
<p>Helene’s path through the Southeast left a trail of power outages so
large the darkness was visible from space. Tens of trillions of liters
of rain fell and more than 200 people were killed, making Helene the
deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005.
Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, and search crews must
trudge through knee-deep debris to learn whether residents are safe.</p>
<p>It also damaged water utilities so severely and over such a wide
inland area that one federal official said the toll “could be considered
unprecedented.” As of Thursday, about 136,000 people in the Southeast
were served by a nonoperational water provider and more than 1.8 million
were living under a boil water advisory, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Western North Carolina was especially hard hit. Officials are facing
a difficult rebuilding task made harder by the steep, narrow valleys of
the Blue Ridge Mountains that during a more typical October would
attract throngs of fall tourists.</p>
<p>“The challenges of the geography are just fewer roads, fewer access
points, fewer areas of flat ground to stage resources” said Brian Smith,
acting deputy division director for the EPA’s water division in the
Southeast.</p>
<p>After days without water, people long for more than just a sponge
bath.</p>
<p>“I would love a shower,” said Sue Riles in Asheville. “Running water
would be incredible.”</p>
<p>The raging floodwaters of Helene destroyed crucial parts of
Asheville’s water system, scouring out the pipes that convey water from
a reservoir in the mountains above town that is the largest of three
water supplies for the system. To reach a second reservoir that was
knocked offline, a road had to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>Boosted output from the third source restored water flow in some
southern Asheville neighborhoods Friday, but without full repairs
schools may not be able to resume in-person classes, hospitals may not
restore normal operations, and the city’s hotels and restaurants may not
fully reopen.</p>
<p>Even water that’s unfit to drink is scarce. Drew Reisinger, the
elected Buncombe County register of deeds, worries about people in
apartments who can’t easily haul a bucket of water from a creek to flush
their toilet. Officials are advising people to collect nondrinkable
water for household needs from a local swimming pool.</p>
<p>“One thing no one is talking about is the amount of poop that exists
in every toilet in Asheville,” he said. “We’re dealing with a public
health emergency.”</p>
<p>It’s a situation that becomes more dangerous the longer it lasts.
Even in communities fortunate enough to have running water, hundreds of
providers have issued boil water notices indicating the water could be
contaminated. But boiling water for cooking and drinking is time
consuming and small mistakes can cause stomach illness, according to
Natalie Exum, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health.</p>
<p>“Every day that goes by, you could be exposed to a pathogen,” Exum
said. “These basic services that we take for granted in our everyday
lives actually do do a lot to prevent illness.”</p>
<p>Travis Edwards’ faucet worked immediately after the storm. He filled
as many containers as he could for himself and his child, but it didn’t
take long for the flow to weaken, then stop. They rationed water,
switching to hand sanitizer and barely putting any on toothbrushes.</p>
<p>“(We) didn’t realize how dehydrated we were getting,” he said.</p>
<p>Federal officials have shipped millions of liters of water to areas
where people also might not be able to make phone calls or switch on the
lights.</p>
<p>Power has been restored to about 62% of homes and businesses and
8,000 crews are out working to restore power in the hardest hit parts of
North Carolina, federal officials said Thursday. In 10 counties, about
half of the cell sites are still down.</p>
<p>The first step for some utilities is simply figuring out how bad the
damage is, a job that might require EPA expertise in extreme cases.
Ruptured water pipes are a huge problem. They often run beneath roads,
many of which were crumpled and twisted by floodwaters.</p>
<p>“Pretty much anytime you see a major road damaged, there’s a very
good chance that there’s a pipe in there that’s also gotten damaged,”
said Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the
engineering firm CDM Smith.</p>
<p>Generally, repairs start at the treatment plant and move outward,
with fixes in nearby big pipes done first, according to the EPA.</p>
<p>“Over time, you’ll gradually get water to more and more people,”
White said.</p>
<p>Many people are still missing, and water repair employees don’t
typically work around search and rescue operations. It takes a toll,
according to Kevin Morley, manager of federal relations with the
American Water Works Association.</p>
<p>“There’s emotional support that is really important for all the
people involved. You’re seeing people’s lives just wiped out,” he
said.</p>
<p>Even private well owners aren’t immune. Pumps on private wells may
have lost power and overtopping floodwaters can contaminate them.</p>
<p>There’s often a “blind faith” assumption that drinking water won’t
fail. In this case, the technology was insufficient, according to Craig
Colten. Before retiring to Asheville, he was a professor in Louisiana
focused on resilience to extreme weather. He hopes Helene will prompt
politicians to spend more to ensure infrastructure withstands
destructive storms.</p>
<p>And climate change will only make the problem more severe, said Erik
Olson, a health and food expert at the nonprofit Natural Resources
Defense Council.</p>
<p>“I think states and the federal government really need to step back
and start looking at how we’re going to prepare for these extreme
weather events that are going to be occurring and recurring every single
year,” he said.</p>
<p>Edwards has developed a system to save water. He’ll soap dirty dishes
and rinse them with a trickle of water with bleach, which is caught and
transferred to a bucket — useable for the toilet.</p>
<p>Power and some cell service have returned for him. And water
distribution sites have guaranteed some measure of normalcy: Edwards
feels like he can start going out to see friends again.</p>
<p>“To not feel guilty about using more than a cup of water to, like,
wash yourself … I’m really, really grateful,” he said.</p>
