## NASA, ESA Missions Help Scientists Uncover How Solar Wind Gets Energy

date: 2024-08-30, from: NASA breaking news

Since the 1960s, astronomers have wondered how the Sun’s supersonic “solar wind,” a stream of energetic particles that flows out into the solar system, continues to receive energy once it leaves the Sun. Now, thanks to a lucky lineup of a NASA and an ESA (European Space Agency)/NASA spacecraft both currently studying the Sun, they […]

## NSA releases copy of internal lecture delivered by computing giant Rear Adm. Grace Hopper

date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News

In one of the more unique public proactive transparency record releases for the National Security Agency (NSA) to date, NSA has released a digital copy of a lecture that then-Capt. Grace Hopper gave agency employees on August 19, 1982. The lecture, “Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People,” features Capt. Hopper discussing some of the potential future challenges of protecting information. She also provided valuable insight on leadership and her experiences breaking barriers in the fields of computer science and mathematics. ↫ NSA press release Digital preservation is about more than just code &#8211; it&#8217;s also about invaluable content like this. It seems rather uncouth to spend only a few lines on who Grace Hopper really is, since it&#8217;s your duty to know already, and she deserves a hell of a lot more than a few lines. If you don&#8217;t yet know who she is, her Wikipedia page is a good place to start. The speech in question has an interesting history, in that the only medium on which it was stored were 1-inch AMPEX tapes. The speech was originally given to NSA employees, but not even the damn NSA had the ability to access the recordings of the speech, and had to call in the National Archives and Records Administration&#8217;s help. The NARA managed to retrieve the footage from the tapes, and now here we are. This will make for some great weekend viewing.

## End of the road: an AnandTech farewell

date: 2024-08-30, from: OS News

I hate this timeline. It is with great sadness that I find myself penning the hardest news post I’ve ever needed to write here at AnandTech. After over 27 years of covering the wide – and wild – word of computing hardware, today is AnandTech’s final day of publication. For better or worse, we’ve reached the end of a long journey – one that started with a&#160;review of an AMD processor, and has ended with the&#160;review of an AMD processor. It’s fittingly poetic, but it is also a testament to the fact that we’ve spent the last 27 years doing what we love, covering the chips that are the lifeblood of the computing industry. ↫ Ryan Smith at AnandTech This sudden loss is sending shockwaves through the industry, and rightfully so. AnandTech is a pillar, a cornerstone of hardware reporting, and one of the very few &#8211; possibly only &#8211; tech news outlet out there with such depth, quality, integrity, and restraint. I can&#8217;t think of any other outlet being as dedicated to proper benchmarking and hardware reviews as AnandTech was, and losing them is a huge loss for all of us. The cause is exactly what you&#8217;d expect, sadly. It&#8217;s simply not really possible to remain profitable writing in-depth hardware reviews and benchmarks, as the world has shifted to video, and advertising income has cratered. There&#8217;s tons of hints about AnandTech not wanting to embrace sensationalism and clickbaiting to increase revenue &#8211; they&#8217;d rather go out with class, and I admire and appreciate that greatly. It just goes to show how hard it is to keep your head above water in the current online publishing world without rampant clickbaiting and flashy videos. In a better, less monopolised world, AnandTech could thrive. Sadly, that&#8217;s not the timeline we&#8217;re in. As far as housekeeping goes, the site will remain up for now, but there&#8217;s no guarantee it&#8217;ll stay up forever. I&#8217;m sure countless people are already archiving the invaluable content AnandTech has produced over its 27 year run, including the forums. We shan&#8217;t lose what AnandTech has created.

</p><p>
	To speed up the approval process of solar projects, the Western Solar Plan identifies 31 million acres of public lands across 11 western states as available for potential development, singling out regions that would bring solar “closer to transmission lines or to previously disturbed lands” and avoid “protected lands, sensitive cultural resources, and important wildlife habitat,” according to the BLM. Individual projects would still need to be authorized through site-specific environmental reviews and public comment periods.

	CNN’s Dana Bash pressed Kamala Harris on her former opposition to fracking on Thursday night during the candidate’s

Asked if she stood by her 2019 statement that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” Harris stressed, “As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.” Harris said her “values have not changed” and that “we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate,” but that she has become convinced “we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking.”

And yes, this was another one for the books: Specifically, summer 2024 was the most humid in 85 years of record-keeping, and likely the most humid summer on Earth, as well, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/08/29/record-humidity-united-states-earth/?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8E7TrnYlqWRk7xLLgLhNF5NOW4jDsLf-x3Ezi31axOBDeJHBBIc2lMrrDwc12l6qNPShR_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>The Washington Post</em> reports</a> based on calculations by the climate scientist Brian Brettschneider.

	“June 2024 and July 2024 both set records for highest dew point for their respective months,” Brettschneider told the 
	<em>Post</em>. “I expect August 2024 to be a record too. Summer 2024 should break the record set in summer 2023.” Humidity notably makes extreme heat more dangerous, a process that is <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/02/01/extreme-weather-worsening-climate-change-study?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8E7TrnYlqWRk7xLLgLhNF5NOW4jDsLf-x3Ezi31axOBDeJHBBIc2lMrrDwc12l6qNPShR_" target="_blank">accelerating</a> because warmer air caused by climate change can hold more moisture.

			Just over half of Americans (52%) would support a bipartisan law that made it easier to build new clean energy projects and benefit some oil and gas development, a new poll by Heatmap has found. “That’s good news for one of the last remaining pieces of environmental policy that Congress could pass under this presidency: a bipartisan proposal from Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso that would speed up the process of building climate-friendly infrastructure in exchange for concessions to the oil and gas industry,”

			At least seven teenage athletes have died in the U.S. in August during or immediately after football practice, with experts saying extreme heat may be to blame.

## Only You (and AI) Can Prevent Wildfires

date: 2024-08-30, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU2OTk5Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyODY1NjMwMn0.F1ik6C0BNRCOKONbpfcPl_D_FjyXU2CZm0hABsdXBHM/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">In a warming world where winter snow is melting earlier and rain is arriving later, “<a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/the-last-fire-season-manjula-martin" target="_self"><u>wildfire season</u></a>” has become somewhat of a misnomer. Some parts of the country now see blazes popping up practically year round. This, combined with decades of fire management policy that promoted suppression over natural and controlled burns, has turned certain states — California, most famously — into tinderboxes.<br/></p><p>With wildfire smoke becoming a standard component of Silicon Valley summers, it’s probably no surprise that numerous data analytics and artificial intelligence-focused startups have sprung up to address the issue. There’s even a San Francisco-based venture capital firm, Convective Capital, devoted solely to funding wildfire solutions. </p><p>“My big question coming into starting Convective was, are there enough companies in this category?” Bill Clerico, founder and managing partner of the firm told me. The answer, he found, was yes. After establishing Convective Capital in the beginning of 2022, he said, “we’ve identified about 500 of what we call fire tech companies.” They run the gamut from startups that work on wildfire suppression to those dealing with identification, prevention, mitigation, and insurance against damages. </p><p>Rhizome, a company making an AI-powered wildfire risk mitigation platform for utilities, is one of the firm’s most recent investments. “Think of it as Sim City for the grid,” Mishal Thadani, CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based startup, told me. “You obviously need to know, as extreme weather events hit, how this is going to affect your assets,” he explained. </p><p>Rhizome’s platform gives utilities insight into, “if there is an asset failure, given the asset type, the type of failure, and the burn probability given the vegetation makeup and the dryness conditions, what’s going to be the likelihood of a wildfire ignition?” This information helps utilities decide where to put their money, whether that means replacing a power line or pole, insulating conductors, undergrounding power lines, or trimming back a bush. Last month, Rhizome announced a $1 million investment from Convective Capital, not tied to a particular funding round. The company raised <a href="https://www.rhizomedata.com/news/rhizome-grid-resilience-launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$2.5 million</u></a> in its pre-seed round last year.</p><p>The problem is not simply a lack of data, Thadani told me — utilities often know things about their assets such as last inspection date and outage history, and have systems that can render the surrounding landscape and other infrastructural features. The problem is that data is not part of a holistic system that can provide comprehensive insights. If risk analysis is being performed, Thadani said, “it’s being done on a super scrappy spreadsheet basis.”</p><p>Rhizome aims to build the “connective tissue” between a utility’s disparate data systems, then combine that with other geographic datasets on climate, weather, and vegetation. From there, the company uses its machine learning models to assess the likelihood of extreme weather events and their subsequent impacts. Ultimately, this allows utilities to provide regulators with more quantifiable information on their plans to improve grid resiliency and prevent wildfires, beyond just citing a figure for how much money they want to spend.</p><p>Utilities are not exactly known for their technical prowess, but are hungry nevertheless for solutions to their wildfire woes. Pacific Gas & Electric, the nation’s largest utility, was driven into bankruptcy after being found liable for a spate of enormous California wildfires in 2017 and 2018. After reemerging from bankruptcy in 2020, it now has a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-27/pg-e-pledges-18-billion-to-cut-wildfire-risk-in-california" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>plan to spend $18 billion</u></a> on wildfire mitigation through 2025. Other utilities such as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hawaiian-electric-nears-wildfire-settlement-aiming-to-avoid-pg-es-bankruptcy-fate-513a3846" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hawaii Electric</u></a> and <a href="https://newsletter.rationalwalk.com/p/berkshire-hathaway-energys-uncertain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Berkshire Hathaway Energy</u></a> face billions in potential liabilities for wildfires in their service areas. </p><p>The most common customers for companies in Convective Capital’s portfolio are utilities, governments, and insurance companies. “These are tremendously deep-pocketed institutions, but they are not, you know, necessarily the most fast-moving or innovative,” he told me. “And so that is the fundamental challenge of building a wildfire technology company.”</p><p>So far, Rhizome has announced partnerships with two utilities, Seattle City Light and Vermont Electric Power Company. But Clerico acknowledges that getting traditional institutions onboard is no easy task, even when the benefits seem clear. The magnitude of the destruction in recent years <em><em>has</em></em> served as an accelerant, though — something the vegetation management platform provider AiDash has seen first hand. Abhishek Singh, cofounder and CEO of the startup (which is not in Convective’s portfolio), said that when he founded the company in 2019, “Every investor warned us not to do this because utilities don’t buy and they won’t invest.” But that’s not what he’s experienced. </p><p>AiDash <a href="https://www.aidash.com/news/aidash-closes-its-oversubscribed-series-c-funding-round-at-58-5-million/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>raised $58.5 million</u></a> in an oversubscribed Series C round earlier this year, led by the impact investor Lightrock, and has five utility partnerships, including Southern California Edison’s holding company, Edison International, as well as Duke Energy. The company uses satellite data and AI analytics to assess vegetation near utility infrastructure for wildfire risk. It can also detect faults by fusing satellite data with other sources such as thermal or LiDAR-based imagery. (Convective Capital sees the value proposition in using satellites for vegetation management, too — it’s invested in one of AiDash’s direct competitors, an Amsterdam-based startup called Overstory.)</p><p>When Singh founded AiDash in 2019, both the size and cost of satellites were plummeting, leading to far more launches and thus far more data. . “Since the history of the first satellite until 2018, there were 2,200-odd satellites launched,” he told me. “From 2019 onwards, each year close to 1,000 satellites are getting launched.” The company purchases mounds of that data to conduct its vegetation analyses. </p><p>Vegetation management is typically the largest line item in a utility’s operations and maintenance budgets, Singh told me, costing the entire sector around $6 billion or $7 billion annually. “It’s also the single largest cause of utility-caused wildfires, as well as the cause of most outages,” he said, as power lines coming into contact with trees, grasses, and shrubs can easily spark a fire. Anything that can help them trim that budget and preempt the need for costly equipment repairs is worth a lot. “These are all million dollar contracts,” Singh told me.</p><p>But big data platforms alone are just one tool in the vast toolbox that comprises a holistic approach to wildfire management. “There’s no panacea, where you just do one thing and then it solves the problem,” Clerico told me. “It’s going to get solved as a combination of consistent and repeated forest management, building towns and cities that are fire adapted, building great infrastructure, and then having the ability to detect and respond quickly. All of these things are huge, multi decade, multi billion dollar investments.” </p><p>So for the foreseeable future, Convective Capital will have its work cut out for it. But when I asked Clerico if one day, in a beautiful, far-off dreamland, there might not be the need for a dedicated wildfire tech VC, he said he hopes so.</p>

## Panama deports Ecuadorean migrants in second US-backed flight

date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA

PANAMA CITY — Panamanian authorities deported a group of migrants to Ecuador on a second flight financed by the United States, as part of an agreement between the U.S. and Panama to discourage irregular crossings and reduce the flow of mostly U.S.-bound migration.


The flight carrying 30 Ecuadoreans departed on Thursday evening en route to the coastal city of Manta, Ecuador, Panama's migration service said, adding the migrants were deported for evading a migration checkpoint on the popular Darien Gap route.


Thousands of people every year cross the dangerous Darien Gap jungle on Panama's border with Colombia on the way to the United States.


The flight on Thursday followed a maiden journey financed by Washington in mid-August, which returned around 30 migrants to Colombia.


The latest deportation comes days after Panama's President Jose Mulino announced return flights for Indian migrants in September and for Chinese citizens on an unspecified date.

## NY nonprofit reclaims centuries-old cemetery for enslaved people

date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA

KINGSTON, New York — On a residential block in upstate New York, college students dug and sifted backyard dirt as part of an archeological exploration this summer of a centuries-old cemetery for African Americans.


Now covered with green lawns in the city of Kingston, this spot in 1750 was part of a burial ground for people who were enslaved. It was located on what was then the outskirts of town. An unknown number of people who were denied church burials were interred here until the late 19th century, when the cemetery was covered over as the city grew.


The site is now being reclaimed as the Pine Street African Burial Ground, one of many forgotten or neglected cemeteries for African Americans getting fresh attention. In the last three summers, the remains of up to 27 people have been located here.


Advocates in this Hudson River city purchased a residential property covering about half the old cemetery several years ago and now use the house there as a visitor center. Money is being raised to turn the urban backyard into a respectful resting place. And while the names of people buried here may be lost, tests are planned on their remains to shed light on their lives and identify their descendants.


"The hardships of those buried here cannot just go down in vain," said Tyrone Wilson, founder of Harambee Kingston, the nonprofit community group behind the project. "We have a responsibility to make sure that we fix that disrespect."


While the more-than-0.2 hectares site was designated as a cemetery for people who were enslaved in 1750, it might have been in use before then. Burials continued through about 1878, more than 50 years after New York fully abolished slavery. Researchers say people were buried with their feet to the east, so when they rise on Judgment Day they would face the rising sun.


Remains found on the Harambee property are covered with patterned African cloths and kept where they are. Remains found on adjoining land are exhumed for later burial on the Harambee property.




Students from the State University of New York at New Paltz recently finished a third summer of supervised backyard excavations in this city 129 kilometers upriver from Manhattan. The students get course credit, though anthropology major Maddy Thomas said there's an overriding sense of mission.


"I don’t like when people feel upset or forgotten," Thomas said on a break. "And that is what’s happened here. So we’ve got to fix it."


Harambee is trying to raise $1 million to transform the modest backyard into resting spot that reflects the African heritage of the people buried there. Plans include a tall marker in the middle of the yard.


While some graves were apparently marked, it's still hard to say who was buried there.


"Some of them, it’s obvious, were marked with just a stone with no writing on it," said Joseph Diamond, associate professor of anthropology at New Paltz.


The only intact headstone recovered with a name visible was for Caezar Smith, who was born enslaved and died a free man in 1839 at age 41. A researcher mined historical records and came up with two more people potentially buried there in 1803: a man identified as Sam and a 16-year-old girl named Deyon who was publicly hanged after being convicted of murdering the 6-year-old daughter of her enslavers.


The cemetery was at first covered by a lumberyard by 1880, even though some gravestones were apparently still standing by that date.


In 1990, Diamond was doing an archaeological survey for the city and noticed the cemetery was marked on a map from 1870. He and the city historian went out to find it.


Coincidentally, Pine Street building owner Andrew Kirschner had just discovered buried bone chips while digging in front of the building in search of a sewer pipe. He put the pieces in a box. Kirschner said he was still digging when Diamond told him what they were looking for.


"The conversation begins and then I go, ‘Well, let me show you what I found.’ Of course, they were amazed," said Kirschner, who had owned the building next to the current Harambee property.




Even after the discovery, Diamond said it was difficult to convince people there were graves on Pine Street. There were even plans in 1996 to build a parking lot over much of the site. Advocates purchased the property in 2019.


Similar stories of disregard and rediscovery have played out elsewhere.


In Manhattan, the African Burial Ground National Monument marks the site where an estimated 15,000 free and enslaved Africans were buried until the 1790s. It was discovered in 1991 during excavations for a federal building. Farther up the Hudson River, the renovation in Newburgh of a century-old school into a courthouse in 2008 led to the discovery of more than 100 sets of remains.


Antoinette Jackson, founder of The Black Cemetery Network, said many of the 169 sites listed in their online archive had been erased.


"A good deal of them represent sites that have been built over — by parking lots, schools, stadiums, highways. Others have been under-resourced," said Jackson, a professor of anthropology at the University of Southern Florida.


She added that the cemeteries listed on the archive are just the "tip of the iceberg."


Given the meager historical record in Kingston, advocates hope tests on the remains will help fill in some gaps. Isotopic analyses could provide information on whether individuals grew up elsewhere — like South Carolina or Africa — and then moved to the region. DNA analyses could provide information on where in Africa their ancestors came from. The DNA tests also might be able to link them to living descendants.


Wilson said local families have committed to providing DNA samples. He sees the tests as another way to connect people to heritage.


"One of the biggest issues that we have in African culture is that we don’t know our history," he said. "We don’t have a lot of information of who we are."

## Trump asks federal court to intervene in hush money case

date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA

new york — Donald Trump asked a federal court late Thursday to intervene in his New York hush money criminal case, seeking a pathway to overturn his felony conviction and indefinitely delay his sentencing scheduled for next month.


Lawyers for the former president and current Republican nominee asked the federal court in Manhattan to seize the case from the state court where it was brought and tried, arguing that the historic prosecution violated Trump's constitutional rights and ran afoul of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling on presidential immunity.


Trump's lawyers said moving the case to federal court following his May 30 conviction will give him an "unbiased forum, free from local hostilities" to address those issues. If the case is moved to federal court, Trump lawyers wrote, they will then seek to have the verdict overturned and the case dismissed. If it remains in state court, with sentencing proceeding as scheduled, it could amount to election interference, they said.


"The ongoing proceedings will continue to cause direct and irreparable harm to President Trump — the leading candidate in the 2024 Presidential election — and voters located far beyond Manhattan," Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in a 64-page U.S. District Court filing.


Trump was convicted in state court in Manhattan of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a payment to bury affair allegations that threatened to cloud his 2016 presidential run. Even if the case isn't moved to federal court, the potential delay caused by litigation surrounding Trump's effort could give him a critical reprieve as he navigates the aftermath of his criminal conviction and the homestretch of his presidential campaign.


Separately, the state court judge who presided over the trial, Juan M. Merchan, is weighing Trump's requests to postpone sentencing until after Election Day, November 5, and to overturn the verdict and dismiss the case in the wake of the Supreme Court's immunity decision.


The high court's July 1 ruling reins in prosecutions of ex-presidents for official acts and restricts prosecutors in pointing to official acts as evidence that a president's unofficial actions were illegal.


Trump's lawyers argue that in light of the ruling, jurors in the hush money case should not have heard such evidence as former White House staffers describing how the then-president reacted to news coverage of the deal to pay hush money to porn actor Stormy Daniels.


Trump's lawyers had previously invoked presidential immunity in a failed bid last year to get the hush money case moved from state court to federal court. A federal judge rejected that request, clearing the way for Trump's historic trial in state court.


U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein rejected Trump's claim that allegations in the hush money indictment involved official duties, writing in July 2023, "The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that the matter was a purely a personal item of the president — a cover-up of an embarrassing event."


"Hush money paid to an adult film star is not related to a president's official acts. It does not reflect in any way the color of the president's official duties," Hellerstein added.


A message seeking comment was left with the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case.

## Harris vows tougher approach on migration, supports weapons for Israel

date: 2024-08-30, from: VOA News USA

savannah, georgia/washington — Kamala Harris vowed a tougher approach to migration along the U.S. southern border and said she would not withhold weapons to Israel, in her first interview with a major news organization since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.


In the interview with CNN anchor Dana Bash, Harris sought to show she is in command of the issues and give Americans a sense of her policy positions with little more than two months until Election Day on November 5.


Harris said she would renew a push for comprehensive border legislation that would tighten migration into the United States and vowed to "enforce our laws" against border crossings.


"We have laws that have to be followed and enforced, that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally, and there should be consequence," Harris said.


She also hewed closely to President Joe Biden's strong support of Israel and rejected calls from some in the Democratic Party that Washington should rethink sending weapons to Israel because of the heavy Palestinian death toll in Gaza.


She said she supports a strong Israel but "we must get a deal done" to get a cease-fire in the Gaza conflict.


"No, we have to get a (cease-fire and hostage) deal done," Harris said when asked if she would withhold weapons to Israel. She has been Biden's vice president since the start of his administration.


Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement that has protested against Biden's policy, expressed frustration over Harris’ response on Gaza.


"If the vice president is interested in a cease-fire, she must support an immediate stop to sending the fire," Alawieh said.


Harris, joined by her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, also said she would like to add a Republican to her cabinet if she wins the election.


"I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my cabinet who was a Republican," she said. 




Surging in polls


Since becoming the Democratic candidate for president last month, Harris has surged in the polls, brought in hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign donations, and had a series of forceful campaign speeches.


She leads Trump 45% to 41% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Thursday that showed the vice president sparking new enthusiasm among voters.


Some critics suggested she might be less polished in unscripted settings like a TV interview, but she appeared to make no major mistakes on Thursday.


Harris defended her and Biden's handling of inflation, saying they inherited a pandemic-ravaged economy that she said Trump had mismanaged. She said much work had been done to lower prices but that "prices are still too high."


Jeremi Suri, history and public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said Harris came across as knowledgeable and a "consensus builder" in the interview but she could have had "more concrete and specific answers" on what she would do on her first day as president.


Harris has moved more toward the center on some issues from the time she ran for president in 2020 until she took over from Biden last month as the Democrats' choice to face Republican former President Donald Trump in the election.


She has toughened her position on migration along the southern U.S. border with Mexico. She also no longer wants a ban on fracking, an energy production method that employs many people in Pennsylvania, one of a handful of swing states that could decide the election.


When asked about her policy shifts, Harris said: "My values have not changed."


Harris dismissed a comment from Trump in which he questioned whether she was a Black American. "Same old tired playbook," she said. "Next question, please."


Trump, in a post on Truth Social, responded to the interview by saying: "I look so forward to Debating Comrade Kamala Harris and exposing her for the fraud she is." Trump often falsely refers to Harris as a Marxist.


Though she has taken questions from journalists on the campaign trail and been interviewed on TikTok in recent days, she had, until Thursday, not done a one-on-one interview with a major network or print journalist since Biden ended his reelection campaign on July 21 and endorsed her.


Bash, who co-moderated the June 27 debate between Trump and Biden that ultimately led to the president's departure from the race, conducted the interview in Savannah, Georgia, as Harris and Walz were on a campaign bus tour.


Harris widens lead over Trump with boost from women, Hispanics, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds.

## China takes mild tone on US official's visit

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Beijing has adopted a conciliatory tone in its reporting on this week’s visit by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan, emphasizing cooperation and open communication channels while claiming that Washington remains "incorrect" on its China policies.


Sullivan's tightly scheduled three-day trip to Beijing ended Thursday after he met with Chinese officials, including the country's top leader, Xi Jinping.


In a readout of Sullivan's meeting with Wang Yi, China's top diplomat, the Foreign Ministry of China on Wednesday called the conversation "candid, substantive and constructive," a phrase that was echoed by a White House statement regarding the meeting.


Sullivan was the first White House national security adviser to visit China in eight years, a period that saw contacts between the countries grow increasingly contentious over issues that included military-to-military relations, cybersecurity, espionage and the war in Ukraine.


It was Sullivan's fifth in-person meeting with Wang since May 2023. The two had previously held talks in Bangkok, Vienna, Washington and Malta. But Wednesday's meeting marks the first time in this series of talks that Beijing included some of the U.S. side's views in its readout.


"The U.S. and China will coexist peacefully on this planet for a long time," Sullivan was quoted as saying in the Chinese readout. "The goal of U.S. policies is to find a way that allows for a sustainable development of the U.S.-China relations."


According to Beijing's readout, Sullivan defined the two countries' ties as a mixture of cooperation and competition, a characterization that's been the core principle of the Biden administration's China strategy.


Some experts say the fact that China allowed space in its readout for U.S. talking points signals Beijing's increased openness to working with Washington.




Dali Yang, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, told VOA Mandarin Service that China used to reject the Biden administration's characterization of the U.S.-China relationship.


"But it looks like the China side is now relatively more accepting of the U.S. side's view," Yang said. "Or at least Beijing has accepted that this is the kind of U.S. position that China must deal with."


After Wang, Sullivan met separately with Xi and senior military official Zhang Youxia. These meetings focused on topics that included Taiwan, the South China Sea, trade policies, U.S. sanctions on Chinese businesses and entities, conflicts in Gaza and the war in Ukraine.


The meetings appeared to be cordial. Photos and footage released by Chinese state media show Sullivan shaking hands with a smiling Xi and a smiling Zhang.


US 'incorrect' in Beijing's narrative


Smiling faces and words of cooperation aside, however, Beijing continues to paint the U.S. as the one that needs to adjust its policies and move closer to Beijing's positions on issues.


Xi told Sullivan the U.S. should "work with China in the same direction, view China and its development in a positive and rational light, see each other's development as an opportunity rather than a challenge, and work with China to find a right way for two major countries to get along."


Zhang urged the U.S. to "correct its strategic perceptions of China" and respect China's "core interests" by halting arms sales to Taiwan and to "stop spreading false narratives on Taiwan."


Prior to Sullivan's arrival in Beijing, the Global Times, China's state media outlet, published a commentary criticizing Washington's "incorrect" understanding of China.


"The U.S. needs to fundamentally change its perception of China and its strategic positioning toward China," according to the article.


The Global Times told Sullivan that "truly listening to and understanding Beijing's words and making a proper contribution to establishing the correct understanding between China and the U.S. should be one of the standards to evaluate the success of his visit to China."


China's political commentators have gone even further, calling on Beijing to remain tough.


In a commentary, Shen Yi, an international relations professor at Fudan University in Shanghai who has a huge following on social media, wrote that the U.S. is in no position to make any demands toward China because of the domestic economic difficulties in which he contends Washington is trapped.


"China should be sufficiently confident that it's the U.S. who needs help from China," he wrote. "Under this new frame of understanding, we have reasons to believe that China does not need to compromise with the U.S."


This kind of tough narrative, often pushed by Beijing and adopted by online commentators during the past decade, remains popular on social media. But Yang of the University of Chicago told VOA Mandarin Service that Beijing seems to be moving away from this kind of rhetoric.


"When China is facing a variety of challenges, and when the leaders of China have to maintain and manage China-U.S. relations, they have to think beyond just making tougher and tougher talks" and relying on this type of approach to be effective.


"The two sides actually have a lot of common interests," he said.

## Biden restarts immigration program for 4 countries with more vetting

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

washington  — The Biden administration is restarting an immigration program that allows migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to come to the United States, and it is including "additional vetting" of their U.S.-based financial sponsors following fraud concerns.


The Department of Homeland Security had suspended the program earlier this month to investigate the concerns but indicated that an internal review found no widespread fraud among sponsors.


"Together with our existing rigorous vetting of potential beneficiaries seeking to travel to the United States, these new procedures for supporters have strengthened the integrity of these processes and will help protect against exploitation of beneficiaries," the agency said.


The program launched in January 2023 and is a major piece of the Biden administration's immigration policies that create or expand pathways for legal entry while restricting asylum for those who cross the border illegally.


The policy is aimed at countries that send large numbers of people to the United States and generally refuse to accept those who are deported. It is paired with commitments from Mexico to take back people from those countries who cross the U.S. border illegally.


Under the program, the U.S. accepts up to 30,000 people a month from the four countries for two years and offers eligibility for work authorization. To qualify, migrants must have a financial sponsor in the U.S. who vouches for them and fly into an American airport at their own expense, rather than crossing at the southern border. Those acting as sponsors and the migrants hoping to come to America undergo vetting by Homeland Security.


Republicans have repeatedly criticized the program as an end-run around immigration laws. They immediately attacked the administration when the program was suspended early this month, pointing to it as further validation of their concerns about whether migrants were properly vetted.


The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Thursday that the additional vetting would include more scrutiny of the financial records that U.S.-based sponsors are required to submit as well as their criminal backgrounds. Sponsors will be required to submit fingerprints, and the agency will bolster steps to identify sponsors who are fraudulent and when one files numerous applications.


DHS said an internal review found some cases of fraud, such as sponsors using fake Social Security numbers, but that the majority of cases it investigated had a reasonable explanation, such as a typo when a sponsor was submitting information online.


"Since the inception of the process, a very small number of supporters were found to have fraud or criminal issues warranting referral to law enforcement for investigation and/or appropriate action," the agency said.


Homeland Security also said it had not found issues in vetting the migrants themselves, saying those who come to the U.S. under the program "have been thoroughly screened and vetted."


When it announced the program's suspension, Homeland Security didn't say when processing stopped. But the news broke after the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that favors immigration restrictions, cited an internal agency report that raised questions about fraud.


Neither Homeland Security nor FAIR have provided that report. FAIR asserted that the report showed that 3,218 sponsors were responsible for more than 100,000 filings and that 24 of the top 1,000 Social Security numbers used by sponsors corresponded to dead people.


Arrests for illegal crossings have plummeted among the four nationalities. Cubans were arrested 5,065 times during the first half of the year, compared with more than 42,000 arrests in November 2022 alone. Haitians were arrested 304 times during the first six months of the year, compared with a peak of nearly 18,000 in September 2021.

## Make your own CDN with OpenBSD base and just 2 packages

date: 2024-08-29, from: OS News

The internet today relies TOO MUCH on just a few big players. When one of them stops working, half the world is impacted because too many services, in my opinion, depend on them. “Too big to fail,” some might say. “Single Point of Failure,” I respond.&#8221; The strength of the internet has always been its extreme decentralization, which is now less evident due to this phenomenon. In this article, I want to show how easy it is to create a self-hosted CDN using OpenBSD and just two external packages:&#160;Varnish&#160;and&#160;Lego. ↫ Stefano Marinelli Stefano Marinelli is a gem of a person, and a great voice for the wider BSD community. In this article he covers building your own CDN using OpenBSD, and a few days ago he published a similar article, but using FreeBSD instead. These are excellent resources for anyone who wants to take self-hosting and data ownership to the next level, even cutting out big players like Cloudflare which often don&#8217;t have the best interests of us regular people at heart. It&#8217;s probably not for everyone, but odds are if you&#8217;re reading OSNews, you might be capable of and interested in doing this. And Marinelli&#8217;s point about the internet being overly reliant on a just a few small players is well taken. We often focus on the front-end of the monopolised internet &#8211; Google, Apple, Microsoft, and so on &#8211; but the backend and infrastructure often also suffers from the same problem. These articles focus on effectively replacing Cloudflare, but something like Amazon Web Services is also a prime example of a service that&#8217;s basically become too big to fail. That&#8217;s not at all how the internet was supposed to work, but unfettered capitalism ruins everything, and this is no exception. While a few of us breaking away from the monopolies and building our own alternatives isn&#8217;t going to have any material impact, it at least aides in a cleaner conscience.

## Americans Say ‘Okay, Whatever’ to Permitting Reform

date: 2024-08-29, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU3MDk4Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NDc0Mjg0Mn0.raG9PS5Wd01AqDpDcctzrKU80LEhRPBSkYzicao85F8/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">Most Americans support the idea of a bipartisan law that would make it easier to build new clean energy projects while benefiting some oil and gas development, according to a Heatmap News poll conducted earlier this month.</p>
<p>Some 52% of Americans said they backed the general idea of the legislation, the poll found. About a quarter of Americans opposed it, and roughly another quarter said they weren’t sure. </p>
<p>That’s good news for one of the last remaining pieces of environmental policy that Congress could pass under this presidency: a bipartisan proposal from Senators Joe Manchin and John Barrasso that would speed up the process of building climate-friendly infrastructure in exchange for concessions to the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p>The legislation is meant to bind together Democratic and Republican goals for the country’s energy development. Democrats in Congress and the White House are worried that permitting delays and excessive red tape could now slow down America’s shift away from fossil fuels. This year, for instance, the United States will <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/04/climate/us-wind-energy-solar-power.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>add less new wind capacity</u></a> than it has in any year since 2020. Experts say that’s due in large part to the lack of new power lines to parts of the country where wind is abundant. Even <a href="https://citizensclimatelobby.org/blog/policy/bill-mckibben-talks-yimby-and-clean-energy-permitting-reform/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>many</u></a> <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2023/04/yimby-nimby-progressives-clean-energy-infrastructure-housing-development-wind-solar-bill-mckibben/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>progressives</u></a>, who have historically championed stricter permitting and environmental review laws, now favor altering them in the abstract to speed the zero-carbon buildout — although prominent groups <a href="https://thirdact.org/sacramento/2024/07/26/draft/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>have</u></a> <a href="https://www.lcv.org/media-center/lcv-statement-on-the-energy-permitting-reform-act-of-2024/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3zaTRePlLv_ySRfYty9hk1TROuqdUH5tcuwBUhgt-KyoPBWNlNmu5cqFw_aem_0_0Xl3f0BqMZVxfaikbrgw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>opposed</u></a> this particular deal.</p>
<p>Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the Biden administration of <a href="https://tiffany.house.gov/media/editorials-letters-and-articles/republicans-unveil-effort-remove-biden-admins-barriers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>dragging its feet</u></a> on making federally owned lands available for oil and gas development. The Biden administration leased 95% fewer acres in 2023 than the Trump administration did in 2019, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/3-ways-biden-reshaped-oil-drilling-on-public-lands/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to </u><u><em><em>E&E News</em></em></u></a><em><em>.</em></em></p>
<p>Under President Biden, the Interior Department has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-joe-biden-oil-gas-public-land-environment-4d2c446ee78f6ed172f28f0fa01c6826#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>acknowledged</u></a> that oil and gas drilling on public lands worsens climate change, but said that information alone does not allow it to block new leases. From 2005 to 2019, roughly one quarter of all fossil fuel extraction in the United States <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-021-03302-x" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>happened on</u></a> federal land.</p>
<p>Beyond those facts, however, having a national conversation about permitting reform is tricky because so many proposals are so deep in the weeds that their importance often isn’t immediately obvious. How many voters are ready to debate whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should be able to fast-track certain new power lines? Or why there should be a statute of limitations for some National Environmental Policy Act lawsuits? (If you’re curious, I wrote <a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/permitting-reform-transmission-nepa-geothermal" target="_self"><u>a cheat sheet</u></a> on some of the biggest permitting reform proposals last year.) </p>
<p>Indeed, many of the people Heatmap polled told us they didn’t know enough to decide whether they were for or against the bill — but those who did feel confident answering largely said they were in favor of it. Across cities and suburbs, political parties and age groups, permitting reform is about 15 to 25 points above water. Republicans are somewhat more amenable to the compromise than Democrats: 58% of GOP voters support the proposal, while only 47% of Democrats do. Independents are most skeptical at 44%, though the idea of the deal still has more independent supporters than opponents. </p>
<p>The idea of a deal commands majority support in every region of the country. It’s also supported by most Americans who say they live in rural areas, small towns, suburbs, and small cities. (Among Americans who live in large cities, the measure commands 48% support.) Even Americans who say they would oppose some forms of energy development in their area — such as a hydrogen project or battery storage plant — back the proposal.</p>
<p>This all suggests that the permitting reform deal could remain largely depoliticized as Congress continues to debate it through the fall — if you were to summarize respondents’ reactions to the survey, it might look like, “Sure, whatever, sounds good.” The public’s apparent openness to a deal also comes as its concern for urgent action on climate change has <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>somewhat cooled</u></a> since 2020. </p>
<p>Over the past few years, too, polls have detected a substantive drop in Republican support for clean energy development. While 54% of conservative Republicans backed clean energy in 2018 <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/climate-change-in-the-american-mind-december-2018/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according to a Yale poll</u></a>, that figure has since fallen to 24%. Building more clean energy does not even command a majority of liberal and moderate Republican support anymore, Anthony Leiserowitz, a Yale professor of climate change communication, told me.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/06/27/how-americans-view-national-local-and-personal-energy-choices/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>A separate poll</u></a> — from the Pew Research Center — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/27/climate/pew-poll-renewable-energy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>found</u></a> that Republican support for building more wind and solar farms has fallen by 20 percentage points since President Joe Biden took office, although it also showed that both energy sources commanded majority support.</p>
<p>“Clean energy used to be one of those things that pretty much everyone supported more or less,” Leiserowitz said. “That is important. That is the backdrop to the deeper currents behind the increasing opposition to wind farms and solar farms across the country.”</p>
<p>“Clean energy,” he added, “has become much more politicized than it was in the past.”</p><p><em>The Heatmap poll of 5,202 American adults was conducted by Embold Research via online responses from August 3 to 16, 2024. The survey included interviews with Americans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.4 percentage points.</em></p>

## Japan’s real first console? Bandai’s TV Jack 5000

date: 2024-08-29, from: OS News

The Epoch Cassette Vision is often reported as the first Japanese cartridge-based game console. But reality is always a bit more complicated. In 1978, years before the Cassette Vision, two Japanese companies put together cartridge-based game consoles that were unique to Japan, but relied on technology and chips licensed from American firms. And hey, despite my whirlwind tour of Pong consoles, I never looked at GI chips. Behold, the *breathes in* Bandai Video Mate All Color TV Jack Addon 5000. (longest console name in the history of the blog?) This 1978 console was the follow-on to Bandai’s earlier Video Mate TV Jack consoles, which were more or less the same as everyone else’s Pong-on-a-chip consoles. (The TV Jack 2500 appears rather intriguing, but we’re not looking at that one today) ↫ Nicole Express As usual, Nicole&#8217;s deep dives into weird consoles you&#8217;ve never heard of are a great read, and this one is no exception. There are many things that make the Jack Addon 5000 unique and interesting, but the one thing that&#8217;s really cool is that while the game lives on the cartridge, the colour lives inside the console itself. Inside the cartridge you&#8217;ll only find the monochrome game chip; the colour is added by another chip that&#8217;s fitted inside the console. Only four cartridges were ever released for the system, so it&#8217;s not particularly more versatile than contemporary Pong clones that had multiple built-in games or game modes. Still, it&#8217;s an interesting footnote, and I&#8217;m so happy we got such a detailed look at this console.

## Vietnam's defense minister to visit US next month

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — Vietnam's minister of national defense, Phan Van Giang, is set to visit Washington next month for a high-level meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, U.S. and Vietnamese officials tell VOA.


The minister is expected to visit Washington from September 7-9 to strengthen defense cooperation between the two countries, according to a Vietnamese defense ministry official and a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the trip has not been officially announced. 


During the talks, the sides are expected to discuss a range of defense-related topics, including training initiatives and the lingering legacies of the Vietnam War. Giang is also expected to sign an agreement to purchase military equipment from the U.S., though Vietnamese officials said the details of the deal are still being work out.


The Vietnamese Embassy in Washington has yet to comment on the visit.


This meeting marks the first encounter between the defense chiefs of Vietnam and the U.S. since the two countries upgraded their bilateral relations to a Strategic Comprehensive Partnership a year ago, coinciding with U.S. President Joe Biden's historic visit to Vietnam. It also signals a strengthening of military ties and could pave the way for further cooperation between the two nations in the future.


The expected visit follows the 13th Political, Security, and Defense Dialogue held in Hanoi on August 26, the first such dialogue since the relationship upgrade.


U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, Bonnie Jenkins, who led the U.S. delegation at the dialogue, emphasized the U.S. commitment to enhancing defense and security cooperation with Vietnam. This cooperation includes programs on military training, medicine, peacekeeping, counter-terrorism, and cybersecurity.


The last face-to-face meeting between Giang and Austin took place in November 2023, during an ASEAN defense ministers’ meeting in Jakarta. During that encounter, the two discussed measures to boost bilateral defense cooperation, with a particular focus on efforts to address war legacies and provide humanitarian assistance.


Topics covered included demining and the removal of unexploded ordnances, dioxin cleanup, and accounting for Missing in Action (MIA) soldiers.


Vietnam's defense minister also extended an invitation to U.S. defense companies to participate in Vietnam's second international defense exhibition, scheduled for late 2024.

## Economics, tensions blamed for Chinese students shifting from US to Australia, Britain

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

Austin, Texas  — U.S. universities are welcoming international students as the academic year begins. But while the total number of foreign students is steadily growing, the top sending country, China, is showing signs of leveling out or shrinking.


Industry analysts say the negative trend is mainly due to higher costs amid China’s struggling economy, with a growing number of students going to less expensive countries like Australia and Britain, and tense ties between Washington and Beijing.


The number of foreign students studying in the U.S. in 2022-23 passed 1 million for the first time since the COVID pandemic, said Open Doors, an information resource on international students and scholars.


While the U.S. saw a nearly 12% total increase year-on-year for that period, the number of international students from China, its top source, fell by 0.2% to 289,526.


That’s 600 fewer students than the 2021-22 academic year, when their numbers dropped by nearly 9%. The COVID pandemic saw Chinese student numbers drop in 2020-21 by nearly 15%, in line with the world total drop.


While it’s not yet clear if the drop is a leveling out or a fluctuating decline, analysts say China’s struggling economy and the high cost of studying in the U.S. are the main reasons for the fall in student numbers.


Vincent Chen, a Chinese study abroad consultant based in Shanghai, said although most of his clients are still interested in studying in the U.S., there is a clear downward trend, while applicants for Anglophone universities in Australia and Britain have been increasing.


"If you just want to go abroad, a one-year master's degree in the U.K. is much cheaper,” Chen said. “Many people can't afford to study in the U.S., so they have to settle for the next best thing."


Data from the nonprofit U.S. group College Board Research shows that in the 2023-24 academic year, the average tuition and fees for a U.S. private college four-year education increased 4% to $41,540 compared with the previous academic year.


The British Council said three to four years of undergraduate tuition in Britain starts as low as $15,000.


The number of Chinese students in Britain was 154,260 in 2022-23, according to the U.K. Higher Education Statistics Agency, HESA, up from 121,145 in the 2018/19 academic year.


Australia’s Home Affairs office said in the 2023-24 program year, China was the top source foreign country for new student visa grants at 43,389, up slightly (1.5%) from the previous year.


Chen said Chinese state media's negative portrayal of the United States and concerns about discrimination have also contributed to the shift.


Bruce Zhang, a Chinese citizen who received his master's degree in Europe after studying in China, told VOA Mandarin he had such an incident occur to him after he was admitted to a U.S. university’s Ph.D. program.


When he entered Boston's Logan International Airport last year, Zhang said customs officers questioned him for more than an hour about his research, and if it had any links to the military, and took his computer and mobile phone for examination.


"Fortunately, I had heard that U.S. customs might be stringent in inspecting Chinese students, so I had relatively few study-related data and documents on my personal computer," he said. 


Zhang was allowed to enter the U.S. for his studies in materials science, but the questioning left him so rattled that he has encouraged other Chinese to study elsewhere.


Cui Kai, a study abroad consultant in Massachusetts told VOA Mandarin that experiences like Zhang’s or worse happen for a reason.


"Students who were questioned or their visas were revoked at the customs are usually those who completed their undergraduate studies in China and come to the U.S. for a master's or doctoral degree in a sensitive major," said Cui.


Former President Donald Trump signed Proclamation 10043 in June 2020, prohibiting visas for any Chinese student who “has been employed by, studied at, or conducted research at or on behalf of, an entity in the PRC that implements or supports the PRC's “military-civil fusion strategy.”


The U.S. says China has been using students and scholars to gain access to key technology and, under Proclamation 10043, revoked more than 1,000 visas issued to Chinese nationals and has denied thousands more.


Critics say the policy is costly to the U.S. and is encouraging Chinese students to look to European and other universities.

## US Army: Arlington cemetery official 'abruptly pushed' by Trump staffer

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

Pentagon — The U.S. Army says a female Arlington National Cemetery official was “abruptly pushed aside” by a campaign staffer for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as she was trying to ensure that rules prohibiting political activities there were followed.


“This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,” an Army spokesperson said in a written statement on Thursday.


The Trump campaign has pushed back, saying that the former president was granted permission to bring “campaign designated media” to Section 60 of the cemetery by Gold Star families.


“The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason, an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony,” Trump’s spokesperson Steven Cheung said earlier this week.


Another top Trump aide, Chris LaCivita, issued a written statement saying, “For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Whoever this individual is, spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces.”


However, rules at the military cemeteries in Arlington, Virginia, “clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,” the Army said. In other words, the Gold Star families who told the Trump campaign that media representatives could be there did not have the authority to allow campaign media to film the event.


The Army says the Trump campaign and participants in the August 26 ceremony had been made aware of the relevant federal laws before the incident in which the cemetery employee was pushed.


“Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption. The incident was reported to the JBM-HH (Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall) police department, but the employee subsequently decided not to press charges,” the Army said.


The Army now considers the matter closed.


Arlington National Cemetery hosts public wreath laying ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier for individuals and groups who submit requests to do so in advance.


“ANC conducts nearly 3,000 such public ceremonies a year without incident,” the Army spokesperson said. “Its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and respect the nation’s fallen deserve.”

## Today’s Leased EVs Are Tomorrow’s Cheap Used Cars

date: 2024-08-29, from: Heatmap News


<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MzU2NjU1MS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1NTk3ODc1N30.PDSnHXfKpCcGs4bNPJwAHdUcrEQ6q1HQ6mpKDz58Fdg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/><p class="drop-caps">The new way to buy an electric car is not to buy one at all.</p><p>Just three years ago, four out of five EV drivers had financed their car or paid in cash, while only 21% had leased the EV, according to data from <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/08/01/2922873/0/en/After-a-Period-of-Decline-EVs-Provide-a-Jolt-to-the-Leasing-Market.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>TransUnion</u></a>. But by the second quarter of this year, leasing had become the top choice: 48.7% of people leased their new electric vehicle versus 34.7 percent who financed and 16.6% who paid in cash. </p><p>That’s a sea change in the way people shop for EVs, and it could be great news for the electric car market — just think of all the gently used cars that will flood the market when those leases end.</p><h3>Why leasing has spiked</h3><p>There are numerous factors behind leasing’s ascendance, starting with money matters. Electric cars still cost more than fossil fuel-burners, but the monthly payment on a lease is almost always less than what you’d pay per month to finance the full cost of a vehicle. In that way, leasing brings EVs within reach for budget-minded drivers — Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at Edmunds, recently told me there are great leasing deals aplenty on EVs because dealers want to move them off the lots.</p><p>A tweak to the federal tax credits helped, too. It got more complicated to buy an EV outright this year after the government restricted the benefits to vehicles with a minimum amount of domestic manufacturing. But the same rules don’t apply to leased vehicles, giving those who lease an EV the option to get a discount on a car that wouldn’t necessarily be eligible if they financed it.</p><p>There are other hypotheses about the rising popularity of the lease. A bigwig at one of the credit bureaus <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/731325/new-evs-usa-leased-not-purchased/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told </u><u><em><em>InsideEVs</em></em></u></a> that leasing reflects buyers’ comfort with the subscription model that has taken over our economy at large. The data also shows that the total number of first-time lessees has actually declined a little since 2019, which suggests to me that perhaps a lot of people who always lease their vehicles decided over the past few years that it was time to go for an EV.</p><p>Leasing is also simply an attractive choice given the current state of electric vehicle offerings. Most of today’s most popular models haven’t been on the road long enough to tell us much about how they’ll age — or what might go wrong when they’re eight or 10 or 12 years old. Lease-holders don’t have to worry about any of that. They need not worry about the battery range inevitably fading, either. </p><p>For this reason I’ve begun, from time to time, to second-guess my own decision to buy my EV. Rather than watching its battery diminish as the years go by, I could have leased it, returned it after three years, and gotten into a cool new EV that didn’t exist when I bought mine. Then again, I’m closing in on the last monthly payment rather than being locked into the cycle of forever payments that comes with leasing. So I got that going for me, which is nice.</p><h3>Why that’s great for the EV market</h3><p>The jump in leasing is having a clear impact on the shape of the electric vehicle market, where carmakers in the U.S., in particular, are still having trouble putting out affordable EVs that buyers want. Luxury buyers, on the other hand, have always favored leases as a way to keep themselves in a shiny, new-ish car, and to avoid the unpleasant experience of owning an out-of-warranty BMW, Mercedes-Benz, or Audi. <a href="https://www.autonews.com/mobility-report/most-ev-sales-audi-bmw-mercedes-are-leases-tax-credit" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Around 90%</u></a> of those three companies’ EVs are leased, a number that has helped the Germany luxury brands get a foothold in the electric car market (especially considering the staggering MSRPs of most of their electric offerings).</p><p>And then there’s what happens to all those leased vehicles. Once a typical three-year agreement expires, its driver must give back the vehicle to the dealership, presumably in the undamaged, low-mileage condition that’s specified in the terms of the lease. From there, the vehicle goes on to start its second life as someone else’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67dYxOXPtfQ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>brand new used car</u></a> — which is why it’s good news that lots of people are leasing EVs.</p><p>While leasing is one way to work around the high sticker prices of EVs, buying used is another. Used vehicles have long been a better deal because somebody else suffered the financial penalty of buying a new car and seeing its value plummet the moment they drove it off the lot. (In fact, what you’re really paying for when you lease a car is the severe depreciation it undergoes during its first few years of life. The dealership has to get that money from lease customers because they’ll get much less for the vehicle when it returns from its lease as a three-year-old and they resell it as a used car.)</p><p>The used EV market, though, hasn’t been particularly robust to date. For one thing, there just aren’t that many vehicles on the market since EV sales really only took off in the past few years. Further limiting supply are the plummeting <a href="https://apnews.com/article/electric-vehicles-shopping-price-used-5f638c3a3f3c729b55860d53ee25270b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>prices</u></a> of used EVs, which appear to be depreciating much faster than gasoline cars or hybrids. Since owners would recoup so little from selling their EVs, more of them are hanging onto their cars.</p><p>That’s why the rise in leased EVs could be good news for everyone else. In a few years, all of those electric vehicles will return to the lot where many will become gently used, certified pre-owned cars that sell for much less than new vehicles. And though the fate of the federal tax credits after this year’s election are uncertain, used EVs currently <em><em>also</em></em> qualify for a tax break.</p><p>Used electric vehicles have their own set of concerns. Their drivers won’t enjoy the full driving range that the battery offered when new. They’ll be responsible for the longer-term repairs if they want to keep the car running indefinitely. But used EVs with 80% or 90% of their original range are plenty useful, and given those prices and tax breaks, they’re a steal, too. And with a lot of leased EVs soon to enter the secondary market, you might even be able to find one.</p>

## US second quarter growth stronger than estimated, government says

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

Washington — The U.S. economy expanded more than initially estimated in the second quarter this year, the Department of Commerce said Thursday, on stronger consumer spending than originally anticipated.


The world's biggest economy grew at an annual rate of 3.0% in the April-to-June period, up from 2.8% according to an earlier estimate.


Analysts had expected no revision to the figure.


"The update primarily reflected an upward revision to consumer spending," the Commerce Department said.


Unexpectedly robust consumption — even in the face of high interest rates — has helped to bolster the U.S. economy in recent times. But with households depleting pandemic-era savings, the anticipation was for consumption to pull back.


In the latest revision, the higher spending was partly offset by downward revisions in areas such as business investment, exports and government spending.


Imports, however, were revised higher.


The 3.0% figure for the second quarter this year was an uptick from 1.4% growth in the first quarter.


The Federal Reserve rapidly increased interest rates to tackle surging inflation in 2022. It is widely expected to make its first post-pandemic rate cut in September. This could provide a boost to the economy.

## Plot to attack Taylor Swift's Vienna shows was intended to kill thousands, CIA official says

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

Berlin — The suspects in the foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna earlier this month sought to kill "tens of thousands" of fans before the CIA discovered intelligence that disrupted the planning and led to arrests, the agency's deputy director said.


The CIA notified Austrian authorities of the scheme, which allegedly included links to the Islamic State group. The intelligence and subsequent arrests ultimately led to the cancellation of three sold-out Eras Tour shows, devastating fans who had traveled across the globe to see Swift in concert.


CIA Deputy Director David Cohen addressed the failed plot during the annual Intelligence and National Security Summit, held this week in Maryland.


"They were plotting to kill a huge number — tens of thousands of people at this concert, including I am sure many Americans — and were quite advanced in this," Cohen said Wednesday. "The Austrians were able to make those arrests because the agency and our partners in the intelligence community provided them information about what this ISIS-connected group was planning to do."


Austrian officials said the main suspect, a 19-year-old Austrian man, was inspired by the Islamic State group. He allegedly planned to attack outside the stadium, where upwards of 30,000 fans were expected to gather, with knives or homemade explosives. Another 65,000 fans were likely to be inside the venue. Investigators discovered chemical substances and technical devices during a raid of the suspect's home.


Austria's interior minister, Gerhard Karner, previously said help from other intelligence agencies was needed because Austrian investigators, unlike some foreign services, can't legally monitor text messages.


The 19-year-old's lawyer has said the allegations were "overacting at its best," and contended Austrian authorities were "presenting this exaggeratedly" in order to get new surveillance powers.


Swift broke her silence about the cancellations last week after her London shows had concluded.


"Having our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating," she wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. "The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows."


She thanked authorities — "thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives," she wrote — and said she waited to speak until the European leg of her Eras Tour concluded to prioritize safety.


"Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows," she wrote.


Concert organizer Barracuda Music said it canceled the three-night Vienna run that would have begun Aug. 8 because the arrests made in connection to the conspiracy were too close to showtime.


The main suspect and a 17-year-old were taken into custody on Aug. 6, the day before the cancellations were announced. A third suspect, 18, was arrested Aug. 8. Their names have not been released in line with Austrian privacy rules.


The shows in London, the next stop after Vienna, came on the heels of a stabbing at a Swift-themed dance class that left three little girls dead in the U.K. In a statement issued after the Southport attack, Swift said she was "just completely in shock" and "at a complete loss for how to ever convey my sympathies to these families." News outlets reported that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London.


The Vienna plot also drew comparisons to a 2017 attack by a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England, that killed 22 people. The bomb detonated at the end of Grande's concert as thousands of young fans were leaving, becoming the deadliest extremist attack in the United Kingdom in recent years.


Cohen on Wednesday praised the CIA's work in preventing the planned violence, saying that other counterterrorism "successes" in foiling plots typically go unheralded.


"I can tell you within my agency, and I'm sure in others, there were people who thought that was a really good day for Langley," he said, referring to the CIA headquarters. "And not just the Swifties in my workforce."


The record-smashing tour is on hiatus until the fall.

## After 20 years, killer, invasive snakehead fish haven't devoured the competition

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

Fredericksburg, Virginia — Most mornings, when the weather cooperates, angler Mike Sielicki can be found out on the water in Fredericksburg, Virginia — about an hour’s drive from Washington — trying to hook a species of fish that was once considered a dangerous threat to the surrounding aquatic wildlife.


“To me, it's the best fish that ever hit the United States,” Sielicki says. “I hope it winds up going in every body of water so everybody can enjoy it.”


Sielicki has fished for northern snakeheads for 20 years, since they first showed up in Potomac Creek, a shallow inlet that feeds into the Potomac River, a major Washington-area waterway. Through his company, Apex Predators Potomac Creek, he takes paying customers out on his boat to fish for the invasive predator, which originally came from Asia.


“I have a fair amount of people that come from out of the state, out of the United States, that come fish with me,” he says on a quiet August morning when the snakeheads are proving elusive so far. “The water here is very shallow, gets very grassy, and that's their perfect habitat.”




Snakeheads first appeared in the Washington area in 2002. Almost immediately, local wildlife officials sounded the alarm. Scientists worried that snakeheads would decimate this area’s native predator fish populations, including the prized largemouth bass.


“The Potomac River is a renowned destination throughout the country for bass tournaments and sport bass fishing. It's huge,” says John Odenkirk, a fisheries biologist with the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. “And so, that was the concern, that this fish [snakehead] was going to destroy that, because they were kind of the same level at the top of the food chain.”


Snakeheads, which can grow to more than 83 centimeters long, have pointy teeth and can breathe air, which means they can survive out of the water for several days — as long as their skin remains moist.


Snakeheads also spawn twice a year, while similar level fish only spawn once a year. Officials worried these unique qualities would give snakeheads the edge over native top-level predators.


“So, on paper, it's like, ‘Wow, they got some competitive advantage here.’ … What was driving the fear was that the abundance of snakeheads would get so high they would just overwhelm the system. That never happened,” Odenkirk says. “They never got to the point where they could threaten the stature of the bass, because there weren't enough of them.”




Odenkirk says snakeheads aren’t dominating their environment in part because predators, including birds and other large fish, found them. And he says the snakehead's natural prey, including smaller fish, instinctively adjusted to its presence.


The fish populations that snakeheads prey on have not declined, which suggests the snakeheads aren’t having a negative impact on the environment, Odenkirk adds.


The fish is also popular with anglers, which has also kept the snakehead population in check. Their firm, mild-tasting white meat makes them a sought-after delicacy.


“Like swimming chicken,” Sielicki says. “It's the most hardiest piece of meat that you'll ever get.”


Despite this suppression, in the United States the snakehead population has become most abundant in the Washington-area’s Potomac River and its tributaries, and in the southern state of Arkansas, where the fish used to be bred for food until 2002, when federal officials banned the practice.




Even though snakeheads haven’t had a noticeably negative impact on the ecosystem, wildlife officials aren’t prepared to give the invasive species the all-clear.


“If they get in somewhere different, maybe where we have a threatening or endangered fish, where there's not as much diversity in the fish community, there could be some unwanted impacts in a situation like that,” Odenkirk says. “So, there's still that hesitancy to sort of embrace the fish all across the board.”


Years ago, worried wildlife officials advised people to kill snakeheads if they caught them. But a recent state survey showed that about 40% of people who catch this prized fish in Virginia now choose to release it back in the wild.


But not Sielicki, who relishes harvesting his catch, which he does on this morning after an hourslong lull, when the determined fisherman finally hooks a 63-cm snakehead.


“Back up! We’re getting ready to put him in the boat,” he calls out. “Let’s see if we can get another one.”

## Snakehead fish: The invasive species disaster that wasn’t

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

Invasive plants and animals disrupt food supplies, carry diseases and cause an estimated $423 billion in damage every year around the world. When an Asian fish called the snakehead invaded waterways near Washington, experts warned it might devour the competition and upset of the ecosystem. But, as VOA’s Dora Mekouar reports, that’s not what ended up happening. VOA footage by Adam Greenbaum.

## Why Really Tiny Nuclear Reactors Are Bringing In Big Money

While we’re yet to see a whole lot of new steel in the ground, money is flowing into <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/fusion" target="_self"><u>fusion</u></a>, there’s a push to build <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-nuclear-company-reactors" target="_self"><u>more standard fission reactors</u></a>, and the dream of <a href="https://heatmap.news/terrapower-bill-gates-nuclear" target="_self"><u>small modular reactors</u></a> lives on, even in the wake of the <a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/nuscale-small-modular-reactor-nuclear-costs-inflation" target="_self"><u>NuScale </u><u>disappointment</u></a>. </p>
<p>All this excitement generally revolves around nuclear’s potential to provide clean, baseload power to the grid. But Washington D.C.-based Last Energy is pursuing a different strategy — making <a href="https://heatmap.news/technology/nuclear-microreactors-radiant-westinghouse-bwx-technologies" target="_self"><u>miniature, modularized reactors</u></a> to provide power directly to industries such as data centers, auto manufacturing, and pulp and paper production. Size-wise, think small modular reactors, but, well, even smaller — Last Energy’s units provide a mere 20 megawatts of electricity, whereas a full-size reactor can be over 1,000 megawatts. SMRs sit somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Today the company announced its $40 million series B round, led by the Austin-based venture capital firm Gigafund. Last Energy aims to deploy its first microreactor by 2026, and CEO and founder Bret Kugelmass told me the company has already reached commercial agreements for 80 units, all in Europe. Nearly half of these will be deployed at data centers, the notoriously energy hungry server farms powering the AI boom. </p>
<p>Kugelmass told me the goal is for Last Energy’s reactor to be transportable in the back of a truck. “We decided to focus most of our specific design criteria based on supply chain and logistics constraints,” he said. Every part of the system is “built in a factory, first tested in a factory, mass manufactured in a factory, and then snaps together like a Lego set out in the field.” </p>
<p>There are currently no operational microreactors anywhere in the Western world, though other companies, including Radiant, Westinghouse, and BWX Technologies are also trying to build one. Last Energy’s investors are betting, however, that it could be one of the first to market. </p>
<p>As of now, the company has reached the permitting stage for some of its European projects. Kugelmass told me that Wales, England, Poland, and Romania are the company’s top markets, and that the decision to start in Europe was mainly financial. “Energy is so expensive in Europe compared to the U.S. — I mean, we're talking like two, three times higher for the exact same thing that we're going to deliver. We can make two or three times more money.” </p>
<p>The company estimates that its reactors can be fully manufactured and assembled onsite within two years. And while Kugelmass wouldn’t reveal an exact price, he said Last Energy will be cost-competitive with solar or wind plus storage. Problem is, there’s not really any precedent that would indicate how realistic these targets are, and nuclear doesn’t exactly have the best track record when it comes to arriving on time or on budget. </p>
<p>At the very least, though, Kugelmass told me the reactor’s smaller size makes a meltdown “practically impossible,” meaning securing regulatory approval should be much simpler than it is for full-size plants. And building on the customer’s side of the meter also allows the company to supply power before it’s officially grid-connected, meaning Last Energy can work around the interminably long interconnection queues that plague the European clean energy market just as they do the U.S. </p>
<p>As manufacturing ramps, costs come down, and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/advance-act-nuclear" target="_self"><u>streamlines its process</u></a> for approving new projects, Kugelmass told me he could see Last Energy entering the domestic market in a few years. After all, with American companies driving the boom in AI and cloud computing, the U.S. has far more data centers than anywhere else on earth. Last Energy has aggressive plans to meet that demand, aiming to deploy 10,000 reactors in the next 15 years.</p>
<p>“But it doesn't stop there, because that's still only like 1% of global energy,” Kugelmass told me, saying that Last Energy’s ultimate goal is to “fundamentally transform global energy.” But that’s for tomorrow. For the unglamorous now, some more prototypes and permits are in order. </p>

## Sullivan: Biden 'looking forward' to talks with Xi in coming weeks

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

Beijing — U.S. President Joe Biden is looking forward to talks with Xi Jinping in the "coming weeks," top White House aide Jake Sullivan told the Chinese leader Thursday as they met for rare talks in Beijing.


Sullivan, the first White House national security advisor to visit China since 2016, met Xi as he wrapped up three days of talks in Beijing which also saw him sit down with Foreign Minister Wang Yi and other high-ranking officials.


His visit came as China was embroiled in security rows with US allies Japan and the Philippines.


At a meeting with Xi in Beijing's ornate Great Hall of the People Thursday, he said President Biden "looks forward to engaging with you again in the coming weeks."


"President Biden is committed to responsibly managing this consequential relationship to ensure that competition does not veer into conflict or confrontation, and to work together where our interests align," he said.


Chinese state media said Xi told Sullivan that in spite of "great changes," China and the U.S. could still enjoy good ties.


"China's commitment to the goal of stable, healthy, and sustainable development of China-U.S. relations hasn't changed," Xi said.


"We hope that the U.S. will work with China to meet each other halfway," he added, according to CCTV.


On Wednesday, Sullivan and top diplomat Wang discussed plans for their leaders to talk in the coming weeks.


They also clashed over China's increasingly assertive approach in disputed maritime regions.


Taiwan 'red line' 


On Thursday morning, Sullivan met with senior Chinese army official Zhang Youxia at the Beijing headquarters of the Central Military Commission, where the two discussed Taiwan and other flashpoint issues.


"It's rare that we have the opportunity to have this kind of exchange," Sullivan told Zhang in opening remarks.


The officials agreed to hold a call between the two sides' theatre commanders "in the near future," a readout from the White House said.


Sullivan also raised the importance of "freedom of navigation" in the South China Sea, where China and the Philippines have clashed in recent months, and "stability" in the Taiwan Strait, Washington said.


Zhang, in turn, warned that the status of the self-ruled island was "the first red line that cannot be crossed in China-U.S. relations".


"China has always been committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," he said, according to a readout by Beijing's defense ministry.


"But 'Taiwan independence' and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are incompatible," he said.


"China demands that the U.S. halts military collusion with Taiwan, ceases arming Taiwan, and stops spreading false narratives related to Taiwan," Zhang added.


He also asked Washington to "work with China to promote communication and exchanges between the two militaries and jointly shoulder the responsibilities of major powers".


'Avoid miscalculation' 


China has kept up its sabre-rattling since the inauguration this year of President Lai Ching-te, whose party emphasizes Taiwan's separate identity.


Thursday's talks also saw Sullivan express "concerns about (Chinese) support for Russia's defense industrial base," the readout added -- echoing longstanding US claims that Beijing has rejected.


He also raised "the need to avoid miscalculation and escalation in cyber space, and ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza," the White House said.


Sullivan's visit comes months ahead of U.S. elections in November.


The Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, would be expected, if she wins, to continue Biden's approach of seeking dialogue with China while also maintaining pressure.


Her Republican rival Donald Trump has vowed, at least rhetorically, to take a harder line, with some of his aides seeing a far-reaching global showdown with China.

## To a tiling WM user, apparently other GUIs are like wearing handcuffs

date: 2024-08-29, from: Liam on Linux

&nbsp;This is interesting to me. I am on the other side, and ISTM that the tiling WM folks are the camp you describe.<p>Windows  (2.01) was the 3rd GUI I learned. First was classic MacOS (System 6 and  early System 7.0), then Acorn RISC OS on my own home computer, then  Windows.</p><p>Both MacOS and RISC OS have beautiful, very mouse-centric GUIs where you <i>must</i>  use the mouse for most things. Windows was fascinating because it has  rich, well-thought-out, rational and consistent keyboard controls, and  they work everywhere. In all graphical apps, in the window manager  itself, <i>and on the command line</i>.</p><p>-- Ctrl + a letter is a discrete action: <i>do this thing now</i>.</p><p>-- Alt + a letter opens a menu</p><p>--  Shift moves selects in a continuous range: shift+cursors selects text  or files in a file manager. Shift+mouse selects multiple icons in a  block in a file manager.</p><p>-- Ctrl + mouse selects discontinuously: pick disconnected icons.</p><p>-- These can be combined: shift-select a block, then press ctrl <i>as well</i>  to add some discontinuous entries.</p><p>-- Ctrl + cursor keys moves a word at a time (discontinuous cursor movement).</p><p>-- Shift + ctrl selects a word at a time.</p><p>In the mid-'90s Linux made Unix affordable and I got to know it, and I switched to it early '00s.</p><p>But  it lacks that overall cohesive keyboard UI. Some desktops implement  most of Windows' keyboard UI (Xfce, LXDE, GNOME 2.x), some invent their  own (KDE), many don't have one.</p><p>The shell and editors don't have  any consistency. Each editor has its own set of keyboard controls, and  some environments honour some of them -- but not many because the  keyboard controls for an editor make little sense in a window manager.  What does &quot;insert mode&quot; mean in a file manager?</p><p>They are  keyboard-driven windowing environments built by people who live in  terminals and only know the extremely limited keyboard controls of the  most primitive extant shell environment, one that doesn't honour GUI  keyboard UI because it predates it and so in which every app invents its  own.</p><p>Whereas Windows co-evolved with IBM CUA and deeply embeds it.</p><p>The  result is that all the Linux tiling WMs I've tried annoy me, because  they don't respect the existing Windows-based keystrokes for  manipulating windows. GNOME &gt;=3 mostly doesn't either: keystrokes for  menu manipulation make little sense when you've tried to eliminate  menus from your UI.</p><p>Even the growing-in-trendiness MiracleWM  because the developer doesn't use plain Ubuntu, he uses Kubuntu, and  Kubuntu doesn't respect basic Ubuntu keystrokes like Ctrl+Alt+T for a  terminal, so neither does MiracleWM.</p><p>They are multiple  non-overlapping, non-cohesive, non-uniform keyboard UIs designed by and  for people who never knew how to use a keyboard-driven whole-OS UI  because they didn't know there was one. So they all built their own ones  without knowing that there's 30+ years of prior art for this.</p><p>All these little half-thought-out attempts to build something <i>that already existed</i> but its creators didn't know about it.</p><p>To extend the prisoners-escaping-jail theme:</p><p>Each  only extends the one prisoner cell that inmate knew before they got  out, where the prison cell is an app -- often a text editor but  sometimes it's one game.</p><p>One environment lets you navigate by only going left or straight. To go right, turn left three times! Simple!</p><p>One only lets you navigate in spirals, but you can adjust the size, and toggle clockwise or anticlockwise.</p><p>One is like Asteroids: you pivot your cursor and apply thrust.</p><p>One uses Doom/Quake-style WASD + mouse, because everyone knows that, right? It's the standard!</p><p>One expects you to plug in a joypad controller and use that.</p><br /><br /><img src="https://www.dreamwidth.org/tools/commentcount?user=liam_on_linux&ditemid=91647" width="30" height="12" alt="comment count unavailable" style="vertical-align: middle;"/> comments

## China's airspace intrusion a 'wake-up call' for Japan, US lawmaker says

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

TOKYO — The intrusion of a Chinese spy plane into Japanese airspace is a "wake-up call" for Tokyo about the aggressive nature of China's leadership, U.S. lawmaker John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, said Wednesday.


The incident on Monday involving a Y-9 reconnaissance aircraft flying near the southern Kyushu island was the first time a Chinese military aircraft had breached Japan's airspace, according to Tokyo, which told Beijing it was "utterly unacceptable."


The Chinese foreign ministry said Tuesday it was still trying to understand the situation.


We've "seen a very different China in the last few years and the question is what's the best way to deter future aggression and malign activity," Moolenaar, who is a Republican member of the House of Representatives, said in an interview in Tokyo on Wednesday.


His visit to Japan, with half a dozen members of a bipartisan committee that has looked at topics ranging from China's exports of fentanyl precursor chemicals to Beijing's influence over U.S. businesses, comes as President Joe Biden's administration looks to expand restrictions on semiconductor manufacturing equipment exports.


While Japan has worked with its U.S. ally to restrict shipments of such technology, unlike Washington it has avoided trade curbs that directly target its neighbor and largest trading partner.


A new rule that will broaden U.S. powers to halt semiconductor manufacturing equipment exports to China from some foreign chipmakers will exclude Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea, two sources told Reuters last month.


In Japan, Moolenaar met trade and industry minister Ken Saito, who oversees Japan's technology exports and is meeting with the Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and other senior Japanese officials.


"The question is what's the best way to deter future (Chinese) aggression and malign activity. We don't want to feed into a military complex that can be used against us," Moolenaar said.

## Second elephant calf in 2 weeks is born at California zoo

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

FRESNO, Calif. — The second elephant calf in two weeks has been born at a California zoo.


African elephant Amahle gave birth early Monday morning, according to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo. The event came 10 days after Amahle's mother, Nolwazi, gave birth to another male calf.


The new additions are the first elephants born at the zoo, about 240 kilometers southeast of San Francisco, which has embarked on a program to breed elephants in the hope that they can be seen by zoogoers in years to come.


"To have two healthy calves is a historic milestone," Jon Forrest Dohlin, the zoo's chief executive, said in a statement Tuesday. "We cannot wait for the public to see the new additions to our herd and share in our excitement."


The elephants and their calves will continue to be monitored behind the scenes for now, Dohlin said. While the zoo expanded its exhibit in anticipation of growing its herd, some animal activists have opposed the breeding program, saying elephants shouldn't be in zoos because of their complex needs.


In 2022, the zoo brought in male elephant Mabu hoping he'd breed with the two females. The future of elephants — which have relatively few offspring and a 22-month gestation period — in zoos hinges largely on breeding.

## US to finalize significant tariffs on selected Chinese imports

date: 2024-08-29, from: VOA News USA

STATE DEPARTMENT  — The White House says U.S. officials continue to raise concerns about what they describe as unfair trade policies and non-market economic practices by the People’s Republic of China.


Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is expected to unveil its final implementation plans for substantial tariff increases on selected Chinese imports in the coming days.


Some U.S. manufacturers, however, including those in the electric vehicle and utility equipment sectors, have requested that the higher tariff rates be reduced or delayed, citing concerns about rising cost.


On May 14, the White House announced a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese imports, raising duties on electric vehicles to 100%, doubling tariffs on semiconductors and solar cells to 50%, and introducing new 25% tariffs on lithium-ion batteries and other strategic products such as steel.


The move is seen as an effort to reshore U.S. manufacturing, enhance supply chain resilience, and protect domestic U.S. industries from what officials described as China's overproduction.


This week, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during their talks near Beijing that Washington will continue to take necessary actions to prevent advanced U.S. technologies from being used to undermine national security, while avoiding undue limitations on trade or investment.


In Beijing, China has vowed to take countermeasures.


Wang this week accused the U.S. of using overcapacity as an excuse for “protectionism.” He urged the U.S. to "stop suppressing China in the economic, trade, and technological fields and to stop undermining China's legitimate interests.”


Sullivan and Wang have discussed arranging a call between Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming weeks. Disputes over trade and tariffs are expected to be among the issues on the agenda. 


Former U.S. officials told VOA that the leaders also are likely to have face-to-face talks before Biden leaves office next January.


“The first opportunity is the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) leaders' summit in November, and the second is the G20 summit in November,” Ryan Haas, a former NSC senior official from 2013 to 2017 and currently a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, told VOA on Wednesday.


Some analysts have downplayed the likelihood of immediate inflation, noting that the tariff increases announced in May target a relatively small portion of products — $18 billion in imports from China, which accounts for only 4.2% of all U.S. imports from China in 2023.


“Because many of the tariffs affect products that are not currently being imported in large quantities, and because they are phased in over two years, the immediate inflationary effect is likely to be small,” wrote William Reinsch, the Scholl Chair in International Business at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a CSIS analysis earlier this year.


This week, following the Biden administration's May announcement, Canada said that it will impose a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicle imports and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from China, effective Oct. 1.


In Beijing, China’s Commerce Ministry issued a statement expressing strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to Canada’s planned tariff increases, stating that they would disrupt the stability of global industrial and supply chains, severely impact trade relations, and harm the interests of businesses in both countries.


Some material in this report came from Reuters.

## Release Announcement Barman 3.11.1 and 3.11.0

date: 2024-08-29, from: PostgreSQL News

<p><a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com">EDB</a> is pleased to announce the release of Barman 3.11.1 and 3.11.0. </p>
<h2>Highlights of this release:</h2>
<h3>Version 3.11.1 - 22 August 2024</h3>
<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fix failures in <code>`</code>barman-cloud-backup-delete<code>`</code>. This command was failing when    applying retention policies due to a bug introduced by the previous release.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 3.11.0 - 22 August 2024</h3>
<h4>Features:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add support for Postgres 17+ incremental backups. This major feature is
  composed of several small changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add <code>`</code>--incremental<code>`</code> command-line option to <code>`</code>barman backup<code>`</code> command. This is
used to specify the parent backup when taking an incremental backup. The
parent can be either a full backup or another incremental backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add <code>`</code>latest-full<code>`</code> shortcut backup ID. Along with <code>`</code>latest<code>`</code>, this can be used
as a shortcut to select the parent backup for an incremental backup. While
<code>`</code>latest<code>`</code> takes the latest backup independently if it is full or incremental,
<code>`</code>latest-full<code>`</code> takes the latest full backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>`</code>barman keep<code>`</code> command can only be applied to full backups when
<code>`</code>backup_method = postgres<code>`</code>. If a full backup has incremental backups that
depend on it, all of the incrementals are also kept by Barman.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When deleting a backup all the incremental backups depending on it, if any,
are also removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retention policies do not take incremental backups into consideration. As
incremental backups cannot be recovered without having the complete chain of
backups available up to the full backup, only full backups account for
retention policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>`</code>barman recover<code>`</code> needs to combine the full backup with the chain of incremental
backups when recovering. The new CLI option <code>`</code>--local-staging-path<code>`</code>, and the
corresponding <code>`</code>local_staging_path<code>`</code> configuration option, are used to specify
the path in the Barman host where the backups will be combined when recovering
an incremental backup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to <code>`</code>barman show-backup<code>`</code> output:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add the “Estimated cluster size” field. It's useful to have an estimation
of the data directory size of a cluster when restoring a backup. It’s
particularly useful when recovering compressed backups or incremental
backups, situations where the size of the backup doesn’t reflect the size of the
data directory in Postgres. In JSON format, this is stored as
<code>`</code>cluster_size<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the “WAL summarizer” field. This field shows if <code>`</code>summarize_wal<code>`</code> was
enabled in Postgres at the time the backup was taken. In JSON format, this
is stored as <code>`</code>server_information.summarize_wal<code>`</code>. This field is omitted for
Postgres 16 and older.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add “Data checksums” field. This shows if <code>`</code>data_checkums<code>`</code> was enabled in
Postgres at the time the backup was taken. In JSON format, this is stored as
<code>`</code>server_information.data_checksums<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the “Backup method” field. This shows the backup method used for this
backup. In JSON format, this is stored as
<code>`</code>base_backup_information.backup_method<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rename the field “Disk Usage” as “Backup Size”. The latter provides a more
comprehensive name which represents the size of the backup in the Barman
host. The JSON field under <code>`</code>base_backup_information<code>`</code> was also renamed from
<code>`</code>disk_usage<code>`</code> to <code>`</code>backup_size<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the “WAL size” field. This shows the size of the WALs required by the
backup. In JSON format, this is stored as
<code>`</code>base_backup_information.wal_size<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Refactor the field “Incremental size”. It is now named “Resources saving”
and it now shows an estimation of resources saved when taking incremental
backups with <code>`</code>rsync<code>`</code> or <code>`</code>pg_basebackup<code>`</code>. It compares the backup size with
the estimated cluster size to estimate the amount of disk and network
resources that were saved by taking an incremental backup. In JSON format,
the field was renamed from <code>`</code>incremental_size<code>`</code> to <code>`</code>resource_savings<code>`</code> under <code>`</code>base_backup_information<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the <code>`</code>system_id<code>`</code> field to the JSON document. This field contains the
system identifier of Postgres. It was present in console format, but was
missing in JSON format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add fields related with Postgres incremental backups:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Backup type”: indicates if the Postgres backup is full or incremental. In
  JSON format, this is stored as <code>`</code>backup_type<code>`</code> under <code>`</code>base_backup_information<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Root backup”: the ID of the full backup that is the root of a chain of
  one or more incremental backups. In JSON format, this is stored as
  <code>`</code>catalog_information.root_backup_id<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Parent backup”: the ID of the full or incremental backup from which this
  incremental backup was taken. In JSON format, this is stored as
  <code>`</code>catalog_information.parent_backup_id<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Children Backup(s)”: the IDs of the incremental backups that were taken
  with this backup as the parent. In JSON format, this is stored as
  <code>`</code>catalog_information.children_backup_ids<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Backup chain size”: the number of backups in the chain from this
  incremental backup up to the root backup. In JSON format, this is
  stored as <code>`</code>catalog_information.chain_size<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to <code>`</code>barman list-backup<code>`</code> output:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It now includes the backup type in the JSON output, which can be either
<code>`</code>rsync<code>`</code> for backups taken with rsync, <code>`</code>full<code>`</code> or <code>`</code>incremental<code>`</code> for backups
taken with <code>`</code>pg_basebackup<code>`</code>, or <code>`</code>snapshot<code>`</code> for cloud snapshots. When printing
to the console the backup type is represented by the corresponding labels
<code>`</code>R<code>`</code>, <code>`</code>F<code>`</code>, <code>`</code>I<code>`</code> or <code>`</code>S<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove tablespaces information from the output. That was bloating the
output. Tablespaces information can still be found in the output of 
<code>`</code>barman show-backup<code>`</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always set a timestamp with a time zone when configuring
  <code>`</code>recovery_target_time<code>`</code> through <code>`</code>barman recover<code>`</code>. Previously, if no time zone
  was explicitly set through <code>`</code>--target-time<code>`</code>, Barman would configure
  <code>`</code>recovery_target_time<code>`</code> without a time zone in Postgres. Without a time zone,
  Postgres would assume whatever is configured through <code>`</code>timezone<code>`</code> GUC in
  Postgres. From now on Barman will issue a warning and configure
  <code>`</code>recovery_target_time<code>`</code> with the time zone of the Barman host if no time zone
  is set by the user through <code>`</code>--target-time<code>`</code> option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When recovering a backup with the “no get wal” approach and <code>`</code>--target-lsn<code>`</code> is set,
  copy only the WAL files required to reach the configured target. Previously
  Barman would copy all the WAL files from its archive to Postgres.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When recovering a backup with the “no get wal” approach and <code>`</code>--target-immediate<code>`</code>
  is set, copy only the WAL files required to reach the consistent point.
  Previously Barman would copy all the WAL files from its archive to Postgres.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>`</code>barman-wal-restore<code>`</code> now moves WALs from the spool directory to <code>`</code>pg_wal<code>`</code>
  instead of copying them. This can improve performance if the spool directory
  and the <code>`</code>pg_wal<code>`</code> directory are in the same partition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>`</code>barman check-backup<code>`</code> now shows the reason why a backup was marked as <code>`</code>FAILED<code>`</code>
  in the output and logs. Previously for a user to know why the backup was
  marked as <code>`</code>FAILED<code>`</code>, they would need to run <code>`</code>barman show-backup<code>`</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add configuration option <code>`</code>aws_await_snapshots_timeout<code>`</code> and the corresponding
  <code>`</code>--aws-await-snapshots-timeout<code>`</code> command-line option on <code>`</code>barman-cloud-backup<code>`</code>.
  This specifies the timeout in seconds to wait for snapshot backups to reach
  the completed state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a keep-alive mechanism to rsync-based backups. Previously the Postgres
  session created by Barman to run <code>`</code>pg_backup_start()<code>`</code> and <code>`</code>pg_backup_stop()<code>`</code> would
  stay idle for as long as the base backup copy would take. That could lead to a
  firewall or router dropping the connection because it was idle for a long
  time. The keep-alive mechanism sends heartbeat queries to Postgres
  through that connection, thus reducing the likelihood of a connection
  getting dropped. The interval between heartbeats can be controlled through the new
  configuration option <code>`</code>keepalive_interval<code>`</code> and the corresponding CLI
  option <code>`</code>--keepalive-interval<code>`</code> of the <code>`</code>barman backup<code>`</code> command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When recovering a backup with the “no get wal” approach and <code>`</code>--target-time<code>`</code>
    set, copy all WAL files. Previously Barman would attempt to “guess” the WAL
    files required by Postgres to reach the configured target time. However,
    the mechanism was not robust enough as it was based on the stats of the WAL
    file in the Barman host (more specifically the creation time). For example:
    if there were archiving or streaming lag between Postgres and Barman, that
    could be enough for recovery to fail because Barman would miss to copy all
    the required WAL files due to the weak check based on file stats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pin <code>`</code>python-snappy<code>`</code> to <code>`</code>0.6.1<code>`</code> when running Barman through Python 3.6 or
  older. Newer versions of <code>`</code>python-snappy<code>`</code> require <code>`</code>cramjam<code>`</code> version <code>`</code>2.7.0<code>`</code> or
  newer, and these are only available for Python 3.7 or newer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>`</code>barman receive-wal<code>`</code> now exits with code <code>`</code>1<code>`</code> instead of <code>`</code>0<code>`</code> in the following
    cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being unable to run with <code>`</code>--reset<code>`</code> flag because <code>`</code>pg_receivewal<code>`</code> is
  running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being unable to start <code>`</code>pg_receivewal<code>`</code> process because it is already
  running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix and improve information about Python in <code>`</code>barman diagnose<code>`</code> output:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The command now makes sure to use the same Python interpreter under which
  Barman is installed when outputting the Python version through
  <code>`</code>python_ver<code>`</code> JSON key. Previously, if an environment had multiple Python
  installations and/or virtual environments, the output could eventually be
  misleading, as it could be fetched from a different Python interpreter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a <code>`</code>python_executable<code>`</code> key to the JSON output. That contains the path
  to the exact Python interpreter being used by Barman.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
