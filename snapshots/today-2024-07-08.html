<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Oil giant invests big in internal combustion engines
</h3>
<p>
The world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, recently invested €740
million (about $800 million) in taking a 10% stake in a company that
makes internal combustion engines (ICEs), the <em>Financial Times</em>
<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3019ce4-be91-4dc8-83c5-489f18bf56cf?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--f0jV1ccwzhIdyK94g0r2nkCrShbhmpfL4Z9dIxiJLM_RrVM-kq5Y28SFnDyRpOwx49Yz_" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">reported</a>,
signalling that the oil giant believes these engines aren’t going
anywhere anytime soon. The investment in Horse Powertrain is based on a
calculation that “as the industry stops designing and developing its own
combustion engines, it will start buying them from third parties,” the
<em><em>FT</em></em> wrote. Aramco’s executive vice president, Yasser
Mufti, told the paper he thinks ICEs will see “significant improvements”
over the coming years that will make them more sustainable, but didn’t
specify what those improvements might be. ICEs, of course, run on fossil
fuels and spew greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Saudi Aramco last
year bought lubricant brand Valvoline, which will supply all Horse
engines with products. As the <em><em>FT</em></em> noted, “the venture’s
success will depend on whether other carmakers are willing to put their
trust in a company born out of their rivals.”

<a href="https://www.project2025.org/personnel/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>friendly
names</u></a> for plum positions in the would-be Trump administration.
Many additional Republicans have quietly (and, often,

</p>
<p>
While
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f" target="_self"><u>nearly
all positions</u></a> in a Trump cabinet have at least some ability to
limit or eliminate climate progress, here are some names circulating for
the most influential departments.
</p>
<h2>
The Department of Energy
</h2>
<p>
The past is prologue when it comes to a future Trump administration,
making <strong>Dan Brouillette</strong> an easy guess to head of the
Department of Energy: His reappointment would mark a return to the post
he left during the presidential transition in 2021.
</p>
<p>
But Secretary of Energy is nothing if not a competitive position, and
Brouillette isn’t treating it like he’s a shoo-in, either. Since 2023,
he’s served as the president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, a
trade association for electric utilities that has taken
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-eei-is-trying-to-kill-bidens-climate-rule/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>a
more tepid stance on climate policies</u></a> during his tenure. He’s
also spent plenty of time going on TV and
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2024/01/25/eei-chief-brouillette-on-trump-climate-law-and-the-lng-fight-00137645" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>speaking</u></a>
to the press against Biden’s (since overturned)
<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6345650468112" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pause</u></a>
in approving new export facilities for liquified natural gas — an
industry
<a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2021/07/15/sempra-hires-former-us-energy-secretary-under-trump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>he
has history with</u></a> but that falls well outside his purview EEI.
The effect is more a performance for Trump than it is any sort of
service for his organization’s members. Brouillette has also repeatedly
<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2024/01/republicans-unlikely-to-kill-the-ira-eei-ceo-brouillette-00137571" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>insisted</u></a>
that the Trump administration won’t gut the Inflation Reduction Act, an
oddly blasé attitude about legislation that has significantly
<a href="https://rmi.org/what-happens-when-utilities-start-to-integrate-the-ira-into-planning/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>benefited</u></a>
the utilities EEI represents.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bernard McNamee, </strong>the author of the Department of Energy
section of Project 2025, is another top choice for the DOE. One of the
“<a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/1060100464" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>most
overtly political</u></a>” people to ever be appointed to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, in the words of <em><em>E&amp;E
News</em></em>, McNamee has
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/mcnamee-im-not-anti-renewable/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
that fossil fuels are “key to our prosperity” and that the renewable
push amounts to “tyranny.” His chapter of Project 2025 calls for — among
other things — closing the renewable energy offices at the DOE,
eliminating energy efficiency standards for appliances, and refocusing
the three National Labs run by DOE on “national security issues.”
</p>
<p>
If Trump doesn’t pick <strong>Doug Burgum</strong> for vice president,
there is a strong chance there could be a home for him at the DOE
instead. Many see the governor of North Dakota as a
<a href="https://www.kfyrtv.com/2024/04/13/senator-daines-says-north-dakota-governor-doug-burgum-would-be-great-energy-secretary-under-trump-administration/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>frontrunner</u></a>
for Energy Secretary, suspicions Burgum has reinforced by cozying up to
Trump as a political surrogate, even
<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/05/12/trump-attacks-biden-criminal-charges-new-jersey/73660138007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>warming
up</u></a> crowds at the candidate’s political rallies. While Burgum
“<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/09/climate/burgum-energy-trump-oil.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>at
times [could] seem environmentally conscious</u></a>” during his
gubernatorial tenure, he’s recently shifted to more familiar Republican
talking points on the oil and gas industry and reportedly helped connect
Trump to would-be donors in the fossil fuel sectors, according to
reporting by <em><em>The New York Times</em></em>. He has also
informally advised the Trump campaign on energy policy.
</p>
<p>
There might also be a high-ranking position in the DOE for Texas oil and
fracking magnate <strong>Harold Hamm</strong>, who was
<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/20/trump-considering-top-fracking-mogul-harold-hamm-as-energy-secretary-sources-tell-reuters.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a>
a finalist for the position back in 2016. Hamm, a conservative
megadonor,
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-31/oil-tycoon-hamm-cuts-trump-support-while-aiding-desantis-haley" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>briefly
broke with Trump</u></a> during the Republican primary but has since
returned to
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/oil-executives-host-trump-fundraiser-houston-2024-05-21/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>fundraise
for his campaign</u></a>. Trump prizes loyalty, however, which is why
Secretary Hamm might be more of a longshot; Hamm may return to being an
informal advisor for the administration instead.
</p>
<h2>
The Department of the Interior
</h2>
<p>
South Dakota Governor <strong>Kristi Noem</strong> seems
<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/south-dakota-gov-kristi-noem-indicated-hasnt-formally-vetted-trumps-ru-rcna158448" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>pretty
solidly off the VP shortlist</u></a> after making national headlines for
admitting in her memoir that she killed a puppy, but she may yet fill a
role in the administration that is less in the public spotlight.
Interior wouldn’t be so far-fetched: Noem played an active part in
slashing environmental protections in her state — something that
<a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/trump-debate-best-environmental-numbers" target="_self"><u>ought
to endear her to Trump</u></a> — and she worked closely with Trump’s
Secretary of the Interior to explore returning controversial
<a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-signs-moa-south-dakota-explore-future-fireworks-display-mount-rushmore" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>firework

<a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-1f9c54dd230724a2e9dc15b42bf4a3ab" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>rolled</u></a>
the Department of Environment and Natural Resources into the Department
of Agriculture and has been
<a href="https://southdakotasearchlight.com/briefs/solar-for-all-but-not-south-dakota-state-one-of-six-not-applying-for-grants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>actively
hostile</u></a> to the build-out of renewable energy, going so far as to

to apply for IRA grant money</u></a> — an action that signals her
uncompromising commitment to the party’s political message to anyone
watching.
</p>
<p>
If not Noem, it’s possible <strong>David Bernhardt</strong> could return
to the position he held under the first Trump administration. He’s used
his time out of national politics to promote
<a href="https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/09/david-bernhardt-biden-is-pandering-to-the-swamp-of-career-bureaucrats/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>better
swamp management</u></a> (that’s the metaphorical swamp, not literal
swamps, such as the critical
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/climate/trump-beaches-sand-protected-areas.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>beachfront-adjacent</u></a>
wetlands he limited protections for while in office) and
<a href="https://thefederalist.com/2023/05/09/trump-interior-secretary-the-monstrous-administrative-state-killing-self-government-must-be-stopped/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>to
push Trump’s plan</u></a> to reinstate Schedule F — which will make it
easier to fire employees that aren’t deemed loyal enough to the
administration — declaring that his own agency had been
“<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/ex-interior-secretary-takes-on-abortion-pills-agency-power-at-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>overwhelmingly
liberal</u></a>” during his tenure. Bernhardt has adopted
<a href="https://www.axios.com/pro/energy-policy/2023/05/09/bernhardts-bureaucracy-bomb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>skepticism
of career civil </u></a><u>servants</u> as something of a pet cause,
publishing a 2023 book called <em><em>You Report to Me: Accountability
for the Failing Administrative State</em></em> and
<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/ex-interior-secretary-takes-on-abortion-pills-agency-power-at-supreme-court/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filing
an amicus brief to the Supreme Court</u></a> earlier this year that
argued, “One would be naïve not to understand how policy drives the
‘science’ at an agency.”
</p>
<p>
Those familiar with Bernhardt’s thinking, though, see the former
secretary as angling for a more ambitious post in a future Trump
administration, such as director of the Office of Management and Budget.
An OMB appointment would potentially put Bernhardt on a collision course
with
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/russ-vought-schedule-f" target="_self"><u>Russ
Vought</u></a>, another Schedule F proponent, which means that if the
former Interior secretary’s apparent angling for a new office doesn’t
pan out, he may end up back in a more familiar role.
</p>
<p>
Trump’s former ambassador to Portugal, <strong>George Glass</strong>,
has also been floated in the Interior conversation. An Oregon
businessman, Glass fits the bill as a Westerner — since 1949, just one
Interior secretary has not been a resident or native of a state west of
the Mississippi. He also sees eye-to-eye with Trump
<a href="https://clubofmozambique.com/news/chinese-investment-in-portugal-is-of-concern-us-ambassador/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>as
a China hawk</u></a>, and while he doesn’t have much of a climate
record, he has been a steady donor whose loyalty could be rewarded again
with a plum administrative position.
</p>
<h2>
The Department of Agriculture
</h2>
<p>
While the Department of Agriculture doesn’t have the same levers to pull
as Interior or Energy, the USDA nevertheless
<a href="https://civileats.com/2020/11/02/how-four-years-of-trump-reshaped-food-and-farming/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>oversees</u></a>
one of the most
<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.518039/full" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>significant
sources of planet-warming emissions</u></a> in the United States. While
the Biden administration’s USDA has explicitly pursued an “equitable and
climate-smart food and agriculture economy,” the Heritage Foundation
instead wants the agency to “play a limited role” that doesn’t “hinder
food production or otherwise undermine efforts to meet consumer demand.”
</p>
<p>
<strong>J. D. Vance</strong> has emerged as one candidate to get that
job done. The <em><em>Hillbilly Elegy</em></em>
author-turned-Ohio-senator previously invested in an
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/2022-midterm-elections-technology-us-securities-and-exchange-commission-ohio-government-politics-861dd10deeb4cdecd335abe3ad4fe775" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>agriculture
startup</u></a> and has taken a particular interest in
<a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2024/03/14/ohio-farm-bill" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the
farm bill</u></a>, while at the same time boasts a
<a href="https://scorecard.lcv.org/moc/jd-vance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>0%
lifetime score</u></a> from the League of Conservation Voters. Vance’s
name has also been
<a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-trump-vice-president-vance-ohio-33c2179a5ace72c742bbb3823298538b" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>in
the hat for VP</u></a>, and he’s certainly
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/jd-vance-vice-president-trump-5157007c" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>done
his best</u></a> to remain in Trump’s good graces, which could land him
a secretary post if he doesn’t ultimately make the cut as a running
mate.
</p>
<p>
There might be a better case, though, that this department ends up in
the hands of <strong>Sid Miller</strong>. Currently serving as the Texas
Agriculture Commissioner, Miller was
<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/11/trump-eyes-top-texas-maga-disciple-for-usda-chief-00151797" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reportedly</u></a>
on the shortlist for the position back in 2016. He has blamed
weather-related power outages in his state on renewable intermittency,
at one time
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/MillerForTexas/posts/we-should-never-build-another-wind-turbine-in-texas-the-experiment-failed-big-ti/3103832863172197/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>writing</u></a>,
“to heck with green energy or climate change.” Miller is something of a
<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2016/11/01/miller-calls-clinton-obscene-term-twitter/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>firebrand</u></a>,
however, alienating even some within his own party, and he could
struggle to garner the bipartisan support that will likely be necessary
to win confirmation.
</p>
<h2>
The Environmental Protection Agency
</h2>
<p>
Though Trump initially avoided answering a question about the climate
during the first presidential debate, he had
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/biden-trump-debate-climate-change" target="_self"><u>talking
points ready</u></a> thanks to <strong>Andrew Wheeler</strong>, his
former head of the Environmental Protection Agency. Trump seemingly
<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>referred</u></a>
to Wheeler as one of “my top environmental people,” suggesting that in
addition to being an informal adviser to the campaign, Wheeler and his
work at the EPA remain in high regard with Trump himself. While in the
previous administration, Wheeler notably
<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/andrew-wheeler-epa-climate-change-bye.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>helped
to roll back</u></a> over 100 clean air, water, and environmental
regulations.
</p>
<p>
Wheeler himself
<a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/holland-hart-welcomes-former-epa-head-andrew-wheeler-in-dc" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>has
been cagey</u></a> about whether he’s auditioning for another Trump
position, though — this spring, he joined the Holland &amp; Hart law
firm as a partner focused on federal affairs. If Wheeler decides to stay
in the private sector, Trump might turn instead to <strong>Mandy
Gunasekara</strong>, one of the
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/02/14/she-pushed-trump-exit-paris-climate-agreement-rollback-environmental-rules-shes-returning-epa-chief-staff/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>primary
architects</u></a> of the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on
climate change and the author of the especially concerning Project 2025
chapter on the EPA.
</p>
<p>
Gunasekara has bolstered the case for herself by describing how she
would curtail the EPA’s powers, eliminate its enforcement office, and
“update the 2009 endangerment finding” that greenhouse gases
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-08/documents/endangermentfinding_legalbasis.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>are
a threat</u></a> to public health and the environment — science that has
been used as the backbone for the EPA’s climate change regulations for
years. Gunasekara has also
<a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1192634090" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>said</u></a>
that while she believes in human-caused climate change, planetary
warming is “overstated” and
<a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/the-5-quotes-you-need-to-know-from-the-ipcc-report" target="_self"><u>erroneously</u></a>
claimed that scientific data shows “a mild and manageable climate change
in the future.” That rhetoric puts her right
<a href="https://heatmap.news/politics/trump-fact-check-intro" target="_self"><u>in
sync</u></a> with her potential future boss.

<h2 id="some-more-thoughts-on-tbc">Some more thoughts on TBC</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: Manu - I write blog</p>
<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;I know, I know. You’re tired of hearing me ranting about The Browser Company and their Arc “browser”. I’m also tired of reading about them but I keep stumbling on news about this silly company and I can’t help myself from yelling at the screen. They aired a commercial on TV the other day, clearly a reasonable thing to do when you have a product with no revenues and no business model. And not happy with that, they released a YouTube video with the CEO explaining the ideas “hidden” in the commercial and that tells you how good at marketing these people are. If you need to release an almost 5-minute video to explain the meaning of a stupid 1-minute ad you probably need a better marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
<p>
Anyway, leaving aside the pointlessness of this whole thing what
prompted me to write this post were some of the things the CEO said in
the video explainer which are so profoundly stupid that I find them
offensive. If you are an ARC user you should be offended too because he
must think you’re all a bunch of idiots.
</p>
<p>
He said in the video that there were three questions he wanted to ask:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
What is this internet we want to live within?
</li>
<li>
What if the web were truly made for you?
</li>
<li>
What are we here for?
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>
What is this internet we want to live within? What do we want to create
for ourselves?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Just to make it clear, what this company is allegedly making is a
browser. It’s in their fucking name: The Browser Company. They’re not
making a new internet. They’re not creating anything. As I wrote before,
they’re not even making an actual browser like the awesome people at
<a href="https://ladybird.org">Ladybird</a>. They’re building a wrapper
around Chrome. This makes the CEO rant about browser monoculture even
more hilarious since by doing that they’re part of the problem.
</p>
<p>
In the video, he tries to argue that Silicon Valley companies are driven
by efficiency, you type something in Google and he gives you an answer
but there are times when you don’t want an answer, you want to get
access to the best set of results because you’re after experiences and
serendipity and a bunch of other complete nonsense. He asked, “Do we
even believe in a single answer?“. The answer is no Josh. No, we don’t.
This is why all search engines have a SERP. No search engine gives you
one answer.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A lot of other times something just seems really interesting to you and
you want to go wide and deep and be surprised there are a lot of other
things we might want to optimise for when we’re designing this new
internet
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Designing this new internet? You’re not designing a new internet. You’re
using some algorithm to decide for me which 6 or 8 results I should be
seeing. In doing that you’re worse than Google.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The second thing is what would it look like if truly the web was made
for you?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I’m gonna ask you a question Josh: how can you make a web for me without
profiling me? I’ll wait for an answer the same way I’m still waiting to
hear back from your support team on that ticket I opened months ago
where I was asking how to prevent your stupid ARC Search from accessing
my sites.
</p>
<p>
You asked “What does the personal web, the personal internet look like”
and there are various ways to tackle this question but it certainly
doesn’t look like a generated ARC Search result page that is the same
for everyone. You said the web doesn’t feel personal because we all see
the same stuff and yet you showed a screenshot of your stupid ARC Search
pulling in results from Reddit and Trip Advisor. Again, if you’re
reading this and you’re an ARC user, they must think you’re a complete
idiot to believe all this stuff.
</p>
<p>
As for the final question, what are we here for and why am I looking at
this video, well Josh, I work in tech. I code websites, I care about the
web. Especially the independent, personal one. The one you’re ranting
about but probably don’t care about at all. I also have to care about
your stupid browser because even though it’s Chrome sometimes it has
bugs that aren’t present on Chrome and so I have to test on it. I’d love
to not care about your browser and your stupid ARC Search but I have to
because this is the world I live in. My email is public if you want to
get in touch. You probably won’t because why would you, you have nothing
to gain from a private exchange after all.

mountaineer found mummified in Peru 22 years after vanishing</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>LIMA, Peru — The preserved body of an American mountaineer — who
disappeared 22 years ago while scaling a snowy peak in Peru — has been
found after being exposed by climate change-induced ice melt, police
said Monday.</p>
<p>William Stampfl was reported missing in June 2002, aged 59, when an
avalanche buried his climbing party on the mountain Huascaran, which
stands more than 6,700 meters (22,000 feet) high. Search and rescue
efforts were fruitless.</p>
<p>Peruvian police said his remains were finally exposed by ice melt on
the Cordillera Blanca range of the Andes.</p>
<p>Stampfl’s body, as well as his clothes, harness and boots had been
well-preserved by the cold, according to images distributed by the
police.</p>
<p>His passport was found among his possessions in good condition,
allowing police to identify the body.</p>
<p>The mountains of northeastern Peru, home to snowy peaks such as
Huascaran and Cashan, are a favorite with mountaineers from around the
world.</p>
<p>In May, the body of an Israeli hiker was found there nearly a month
after he disappeared.</p>
<p>And last month, an experienced Italian mountaineer was found dead
after he fell while trying to scale another Andean peak.</p>

id="searing-heat-grips-parts-of-us-causes-deaths-in-the-west">Searing
heat grips parts of US, causes deaths in the West</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>death valley, california — A searing heat wave gripped large parts of
the United States on Monday, with record daily high temperatures in
Oregon suspected to have caused four deaths in the Portland area
following a motorcyclist’s death in dangerous heat over the weekend in
Death Valley, California.</p>
<p>More than 146 million people around the U.S. were under heat alerts
Monday, especially in the Western states. California, Nevada, Arizona,
Oregon, Washington and Idaho on Monday were under an excessive heat
warning, the National Weather Service’s highest alert, while parts of
the East Coast as well as Alabama and Mississippi were under heat
advisories.</p>
<p>The early U.S. heat wave came as the global temperature in June
reached record warmth for the 13th straight month and marked the 12th
straight month that the world was 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees
Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, the European climate
service Copernicus said.</p>
<p>Dozens of locations in the West and Pacific Northwest tied or broke
previous heat records over the weekend and are expected to keep doing so
into the week.</p>
<p>In Oregon’s Multnomah County, home to Portland, the medical examiner
is investigating four suspected heat-related deaths recorded Friday,
Saturday and Sunday, officials said. Three of the deaths involved county
residents who were 64, 75 and 84 years old, county officials said in an
email. Heat also was suspected in the death of a 33-year-old man
transported to a Portland hospital from outside the county.</p>
<p>Portland broke daily record temperatures Friday, Saturday and Sunday
and was on track to do so again on Monday with a forecast high of 102
degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 Celsius), National Weather Service
meteorologist Hannah Chandler-Cooley said. High temperatures were
expected in Portland through Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>“We are looking at the potential for breaking more records,” she
said.</p>
<p>The temperatures aren’t expected to reach as high as they did during
a similar heat wave in the Pacific Northwest in 2021, which killed an
estimated 600 people across Oregon, Washington and western Canada. But
the duration could be problematic because many homes in the region lack
air conditioning. Round-the-clock hot weather keeps people from cooling
off sufficiently at night, and the issue is compounded in urban areas
where concrete and pavement store heat.</p>
<p>Heat illness and injury are cumulative and can build over the course
of a day or days, officials warn. In San Jose, California, a homeless
man died last week from apparent heat-related causes, Mayor Matt Mahan
reported on the social platform X, calling it “an avoidable tragedy.”
San Jose police said the man’s body had no obvious signs of foul
play.</p>
<p>In eastern California’s sizzling desert, a high temperature of 128 F
(53.3 C) was recorded Saturday and Sunday at Death Valley National Park,
where a visitor, who was not identified, died Saturday from heat
exposure. Another person was hospitalized, officials said.</p>
<p>They were among six motorcyclists riding through the Badwater Basin
area in scorching weather, the park said in a statement. The other four
were treated at the scene. Emergency medical helicopters were unable to
respond because the aircraft cannot generally fly safely over 120 F
(48.8 C), officials said.</p>
<p>More extreme highs are in the near-term forecast, with a high of
around 127 F (52.7 C) expected in Death Valley on Monday, and possibly
130 F (54.4 C) around midweek.</p>
<p>The largest national park outside Alaska, Death Valley is considered
one of the most extreme environments in the world and is among the
hottest during the summer. The hottest temperature ever officially
recorded on Earth was 134 F (56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley,
though some experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was
130 F (54.4 C), recorded there in July 2021.</p>
<p>“While this is a very exciting time to experience potential
world-record-setting temperatures in Death Valley, we encourage visitors
to choose their activities carefully, avoiding prolonged periods of time
outside an air-conditioned vehicle or building when temperatures are
this high,” park Superintendent Mike Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Across the desert in Nevada, Las Vegas set a record high of 120 F
(48.8 C) Sunday and was forecast to hit a record high of 115 F (46.1 C)
Monday. The National Weather Service forecast a high of 117 F (47.2 C)
in Phoenix.</p>
<p>People flocked Monday to the beaches around Lake Tahoe, especially
Sand Harbor State Park, where the record high of 92 (33.3) set Sunday
smashed the old record of 88 (31.1 ) set in 2014. For the fifth
consecutive day, Sand Harbor closed its gates within 90 minutes of
opening at 8 a.m. because it had reached capacity.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely hotter than we are used to,” Nevada State Parks
spokesperson Tyler Kerver said.</p>

<h2 id="us-not-expecting-policy-change-from-iran-under-new-president">US
not expecting policy change from Iran under new president</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-09, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The United States said Monday that it did not expect
policy changes from Iran after voters elected reformist candidate Masoud
Pezeshkian, and downplayed chances to resume dialogue.</p>
<p>“We have no expectation that this election will lead to a fundamental
change in Iran’s direction or its policies,” State Department
spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters.</p>
<p>Miller said Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was expected to
call the shots in Iran, an adversary of the United States since the 1979
Islamic revolution.</p>
<p>“Obviously, if the new president had the authority to make steps to
curtail Iran’s nuclear program, to stop funding terrorism, to stop
destabilizing activities in the region, those would be steps that we
would welcome,” Miller said.</p>
<p>“But needless to say, we don’t have any expectation that that’s
what’s likely to ensue.”</p>
<p>Asked if the United States was at least willing to reopen diplomacy
with Iran after Pezeshkian’s election, Miller said: “We have always said
that diplomacy is the most effective way to achieve an effective,
sustainable solution with regard to Iran’s nuclear program.”</p>
<p>But at the White House, National Security Council spokesperson John
Kirby, asked if the United States was ready to resume nuclear talks with
Iran, said emphatically, “No.”</p>
<p>“We’ll see what this guy wants to get done, but we are not expecting
any changes in Iranian behavior,” Kirby said.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden took office in 2021 with hopes of returning to a
2015 nuclear deal with Iran that was negotiated under former President
Barack Obama and ended by his successor, Donald Trump, who imposed
sweeping sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>But talks, negotiated through the European Union, broke down in part
over a dispute about the extent to which the United States would remove
sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>Relations have deteriorated further since the October 7 attack on
U.S. ally Israel by Hamas, which receives support from Iran.</p>

id="paramount-skydance-merge-ending-redstone-family-reign">Paramount,
Skydance merge, ending Redstone family reign</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>NEW YORK — The entertainment giant Paramount will merge with
Skydance, closing out a decades-long run by the Redstone family in
Hollywood and injecting desperately needed cash into a legacy studio
that has struggled to adapt to a shifting entertainment landscape. </p>
<p>It also signals the rise of a new power player, David Ellison, the
founder of Skydance and son of billionaire Larry Ellison, the founder of
the software company Oracle. </p>
<p>Shari Redstone’s National Amusements has owned more than
three-quarters of Paramount’s Class A voting shares through the estate
of her late father, Sumner Redstone. She had battled to maintain control
of the company that owns CBS, which is behind blockbuster films such as
“Top Gun” and “The Godfather.” </p>
<p>Just weeks after turning down a similar agreement with Skydance,
however, Redstone agreed to a deal on terms that had not changed
much. </p>
<p>“Given the changes in the industry, we want to fortify Paramount for
the future while ensuring that content remains king,” said Redstone, who
is chair of Paramount Global.</p>
<p>The new combined company is valued at around $28 billion. In
connection with the proposed transaction, which is expected to close in
September 2025 pending regulatory approval, a consortium led by the
Ellison family and RedBird Capital will be investing $8 billion. </p>
<p>Skydance, based in Santa Monica, California, has helped produce some
major  </p>
<p>Paramount hits in recent years, including Tom Cruise films like “Top
Gun: Maverick” and installments of the “Mission Impossible” series. </p>
<p>Skydance was founded in 2010 by David Ellison and it quickly formed a
production partnership with Paramount that same year. If the deal is
approved, Ellison will become chairman and chief executive officer of
what’s being called New Paramount. </p>
<p>Ellison outlined the vision for New Paramount on a conference call
about the transaction Monday. In addition to doubling down on core
competencies, notably with a “creative first” approach, he stressed that
the company needs to transition into a “tech hybrid” to stay competitive
in today’s evolving media landscape. </p>
<p>“You’ve watched some incredibly powerful technology companies move
into the … media space and do so very successfully,” Ellison said. He
added that it was “essential” for New Paramount to chart a similar
course going forward. </p>
<p>That includes plans to “rebuild” the Paramount+ streaming service,
Ellison noted — pointing to wider goals to expand direct-to-consumer
business, such as increasing engagement time on the platform and
reducing user churn. He also said that the company aims to transition to
more cloud-based production and continue the use of generative
artificial intelligence to boost efficiency. </p>
<p>Executives also outlined further restructuring plans for New
Paramount on Monday’s conference call, with chairman of RedBird Sports
and Media Jeff Shell noting that they had identified some $2 billion in
cost efficiencies and synergies that they’ll “attempt to deliver pretty
rapidly.” </p>
<p>Shell and others addressed the declining growth of linear TV.
Flagship linear brands will continue to represent a big chunk of the
company’s operations, but learning how to run this portion of business
differently will be key, he said. </p>
<p>Paramount’s struggles</p>
<p>The on-again, off-again merger arrives at a tumultuous time for
Paramount, which has struggled to find its footing for years and its
cable business has been hemorrhaging. In an annual shareholder meeting
in early June, the company also laid out a restructuring plan that
included major cost cuts. </p>
<p>Leadership at Paramount was also volatile earlier this year after its
CEO Bob Bakish, following several disputes with Redstone, was replaced
with an “office of the C.E.O,” run by three executives. Four company
directors were also replaced. </p>
<p>Paramount is one of Hollywood’s oldest studios, dating back its
founding in 1914 as a  distributor. Throughout its rich history,
Paramount has had a hand in releasing films — from “Sunset Boulevard”
and “The Godfather,” to “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “Titanic.” </p>
<p>The studio also distributed several early Marvel Cinematic Universe
films, including “Iron Man” and “Thor,” before the Disney acquisition.
In addition to “Mission: Impossible” and “Top Gun,” Paramount’s current
franchises include “Transformers,” “Star Trek” and “Jackass.” </p>
<p>While Paramount has not topped the annual domestic box office charts
for over a decade, the wild box office success of “Top Gun: Maverick” in
2022 (nearly $1.5 billion worldwide) was an important boon to both movie
theaters and the industry’s pandemic recovery. </p>
<p>Still, its theatrical output has declined somewhat in recent years.
Last year it released only eight new movies and came in fifth place for
overall box office at around $2 billion — behind Universal (24 films),
Disney (17 films), Warner Bros. and Sony. </p>
<p>Movie plans</p>
<p>This year the release calendar is similarly modest, especially with
the absence of “Mission: Impossible 8,” which was pushed to 2025 amid
the strikes. The studio has had some successes, with “Bob Marley: One
Love” and “A Quiet Place: Day One,” and still to come is Ridley Scott’s
“Gladiator” sequel. </p>
<p>The National Association of Theatre Owners, a trade organization that
represents over 35,000 screens in the U.S., said in a statement Monday
that it plans to look closely at the details of the merger with an eye
toward whether it will produce more or less theatrical releases. </p>
<p>“We are encouraged by the commitment that David Ellison and the
Skydance Media team have shown to theatrical exhibition in the past,”
said Michael O’Leary, president and CEO of the National Association of
Theatre Owners. “A merger that results in fewer movies being produced
will not only hurt consumers and result in less revenue, but negatively
impact people who work in all sectors of this great industry — creative,
distribution and exhibition.”</p>

id="park-benches-and-grandmothers-zimbabwes-novel-mental-health-therapy-spreads-overseas">Park
benches and grandmothers: Zimbabwe’s novel mental health therapy spreads
overseas</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Harare, Zimbabwe — After her son, the family’s shining light and only
breadwinner, was arrested last year, Tambudzai Tembo went into meltdown.
In Zimbabwe, where clinical mental health services are scarce, her
chances of getting professional help were next to zero. She contemplated
suicide.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to live anymore. People who saw me would think
everything was OK. But inside, my head was spinning,” the 57-year-old
said. “I was on my own.”</p>
<p>A wooden bench and an empathetic grandmother saved her.</p>
<p>Older people are at the center of a homegrown form of mental health
therapy in Zimbabwe that is now being adopted in places like the United
States.</p>
<p>The approach involves setting up benches in quiet, discreet corners
of community clinics and in some churches, poor neighborhoods and at a
university. An older woman with basic training in problem-solving
therapy patiently sits there, ready to listen and engage in a one-on-one
conversation.</p>
<p>The therapy is inspired by traditional practice in Zimbabwe in which
grandmothers were the go-to people for wisdom in rough times. It had
been abandoned with urbanization, the breakdown of tight-knit extended
families and modern technology. Now it is proving useful again as mental
health needs grow.</p>
<p>“Grandmothers are the custodians of local culture and wisdom. They
are rooted in their communities,” said Dixon Chibanda, a psychiatry
professor and founder of the initiative.</p>
<p>“They don’t leave, and in addition, they have an amazing ability to
use what we call ‘expressed empathy’… to make people feel respected and
understood.”</p>
<p>Last year, Chibanda was named the winner of a $150,000 prize by the
U.S.-based McNulty Foundation for revolutionizing mental healthcare.
Chibanda said the concept has taken root in parts of Vietnam, Botswana,
Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania and is in “preliminary formative work” in
London.</p>
<p>In New York, the city’s new mental health plan launched last year
says it is “drawing inspiration” from what it calls the Friendship Bench
to help address risk factors such as social isolation. The orange
benches are now in areas including Harlem, Brooklyn and the Bronx.</p>
<p>In Washington, the organization HelpAge USA is piloting the concept
under the DC Grandparents for Mental Health initiative, which started in
2022 as a COVID-19 support group of people 60 and above.</p>
<p>So far, 20 grandmothers have been trained by a team from Friendship
Bench Zimbabwe to listen, empathize and empower others to solve their
problems, said Cindy Cox-Roman, the president and chief executive of
HelpAge USA.</p>
<p>Benches will be set up at places of worship, schools and wellness
centers in Washington’s low-income communities with people who “have
been historically marginalized and more likely to experience mental
health problems,” she said.</p>
<p>Cox-Roman cited fear and distrust in the medical system, lack of
social support and stigma as some of the factors limiting access to
treatment.</p>
<p>“People are hurting, and a grandmother can always make you feel
better,” she said.</p>
<p>More than one in five U.S. adults live with a mental illness,
according to the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>“The mental health crisis is real. Where it’s a real crisis after the
pandemic is that many clinicians have dropped out of the workforce,”
said Dr. Jehan El-Mayoumi, who works as an expert with HelpAge USA and
is a founding director of the health equity Rodham Institute at
Georgetown University. She has struggled to get psychiatrists for
acutely suicidal patients.</p>
<p>El-Mayoumi said the Zimbabwean concept provides people with “someone
you can trust, open up your heart to, that you can tell your deepest
secrets [and] that requires trust, so that’s what’s so wonderful about
the Friendship Bench.”</p>
<p>The idea was born out of tragedy. Chibanda was a young psychiatrist,
and one of just over 10 in Zimbabwe in 2005. One of his patients
desperately wanted to see him, but she could not afford the $15 bus
fare. Chibanda later learned that she had killed herself.</p>
<p>“I realized that I needed to have a stronger presence in the
community,” Chibanda said. “I realized that actually one of the most
valuable resources are these grandmothers, the custodians of local
culture.”</p>
<p>He recruited 14 grandmothers in the neighborhood near the hospital
where he worked in the capital, Harare, and trained them. In Zimbabwe,
they get $25 a month to help with transport and phone bills.</p>
<p>The network, which now partners with the health ministry and the
World Health Organization, has grown to over 2,000 grandmothers across
the country. Over 200,000 Zimbabweans sat on a bench to get therapy from
a trained grandmother in 2023, according to the network.</p>
<p>Siridzayi Dzukwa, the grandmother who talked Tembo out of suicide,
made a home follow-up visit on a recent day. Using a written
questionnaire, she checked on Tembo’s progress. She listened as Tembo
talked about how she has found a new lease on life and now sells
vegetables to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Dzukwa has become a recognizable figure in the area. People stop to
greet and thank her for helping them. Some ask for a home visit or take
down her number.</p>
<p>“People are no longer ashamed or afraid of openly stopping us on the
streets and ask us to talk,” she said. “Mental health is no longer
something to be ashamed of.”</p>

id="new-parents-in-baltimore-could-get-1000-baby-bonus-under-new-initiative">New
parents in Baltimore could get $1,000 ‘baby bonus’ under new
initiative</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BALTIMORE — New parents in Baltimore could receive a $1,000 “baby
bonus” if voters approve a proposal that aims to help reduce childhood
poverty from birth with a modest one-time cash payment. </p>
<p>A group of Baltimore teachers is behind the effort. Organizers
recently secured the necessary 10,000 signatures to bring the question
to voters as a ballot initiative in November. Their campaign relied on
extensive canvassing efforts and a cute logo: a flying cartoon stork
with a bag of money in its beak. </p>
<p>The proposal is loosely modeled on a program implemented this year in
Flint, Michigan, where women receive $1,500 during mid-pregnancy and
$500 per month for the first year after giving birth. Officials said the
Flint program was the first of its kind in the U.S. </p>
<p>Countries in Europe and Asia have experimented with larger cash
payments, but those programs are meant to encourage more people to have
more kids, not address child poverty. Italy, which has one of the
world’s lowest birth rates, provides baby bonus checks and other
benefits aimed at increasing the population. </p>
<p>Organizers behind the Baltimore campaign say more systemic change is
needed on a national level to help lift families out of poverty, but
giving new parents a modest financial boost could prove an important
first step. </p>
<p>“If we’re going to spend a limited amount of money, where do you get
the most bang for your buck? Research says at birth,” said Nate Golden,
a high school math teacher who helped found the Maryland Child Alliance,
which is pushing for the ballot initiative. “This could literally have a
lifelong impact on a kid.” </p>
<p>Golden said he also hopes the program will demonstrate to elected
leaders in Baltimore and beyond that there’s a real appetite among
voters for implementing policies that help vulnerable children
succeed. </p>
<p>The issue is particularly urgent in Baltimore, where an estimated 31%
of school-aged children are experiencing poverty, according to census
data. Nationally, childhood poverty fell during the pandemic thanks to
federal relief programs, but it has since climbed again to about 12% in
2022. </p>
<p>It’s incredibly hard for the poor to move up the economic ladder,
especially among communities of color. Research shows that most American
children born into the lowest income bracket will remain at roughly the
same socioeconomic status for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>Golden said he sees similar scenarios playing out in his classroom
every school year — with students who are experiencing homelessness,
food insecurity, gun violence and countless other challenges. </p>
<p>“When you see what they’re going through outside school, I’m still
going to demand their best in the classroom but it’s just not enough,”
he said. “We have to take care of these underlying needs before we can
get kids to focus on learning.” </p>
<p>If the ballot initiative is approved, all new parents in Baltimore
will receive a one-time payment of at least $1,000. </p>
<p>An estimated 7,000 children are born in Baltimore each year, so the
program would cost about $7 million annually, which is roughly 0.16% of
the city’s annual operating budget, according to supporters. The
initiative won’t result in higher taxes, but it will be up to
Baltimore’s City Council to allocate funds if it passes. </p>
<p>Advocates say taking a blanket approach to distributing the funds
ensures that no one falls through the cracks. It also means some of the
money goes to affluent parents who don’t need assistance, but Golden
said it’s worth including them to avoid leaving out the poorest
families. </p>
<p>Considering the payments are relatively small, the universal approach
makes sense because researching and developing a qualification system
could add significant costs and delay implementing the program, said
Christina DePasquale, associate professor of economics at the Johns
Hopkins Carey Business School. </p>
<p>Above all, DePasquale said, the initiative will raise awareness about
childhood poverty  </p>
<p>and could lead to more comprehensive changes down the road. </p>
<p>“It’s worthwhile in the sense that it gets people thinking about it,”
she said. “It’s something to build off of. Even if you don’t have
something perfect, the less perfect version of it is better than not
having it at all.” </p>
<p>While no one contends that $1,000 is a life-changing amount of money,
it could help cover some of the many costs that come with having a baby,
including paying for diapers, formula, strollers, cribs and more. And
for new parents living on society’s margins, that could make a real
difference, said Nadya Dutchin, executive director of the
Baltimore-based organization ShareBaby, which distributes free diapers
and other baby essentials. </p>
<p>“I don’t think people really pay enough attention to the material
insecurities that contribute to parental stress,” she said. “If you
don’t have enough money to purchase diapers to keep your child dry, safe
and healthy, you’re going to be stressed and your baby is going to be
stressed.” </p>
<p>She said requests for supplies increased a huge amount last year amid
rising inflation and stagnant wages. </p>
<p>The largest federal program aimed at addressing childhood poverty is
the child tax credit, which was temporarily expanded during the
pandemic. Although shown to be effective, advocates say it leaves out
some families because of necessary paperwork and qualification
requirements.</p>

China</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjU1Mzk0Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc1ODU1Njg2OX0.U6pikFxhkVP1QjNh3QLVWexnMOTHcLCz4-6l9JnMREU/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
It’s raining again in China. Reservoirs are filling, and the country’s
massive hydropower complex is generating power at closer to normal
capacity after years of drought. This could mean that China’s emissions
of greenhouse gases — the largest in the world — may be peaking, or even
<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/have-we-reached-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">already
have peaked</a>. And as goes China’s emissions, so go the world’s.
</p>
<p>
Hydro generation has grown 16% through May of this year compared to
January through May of last year, according to a <em>Reuters</em>
analysis of Chinese government statistics. “Hydro storage is about as
good as it’s ever been” in China, Alex Turnbull, an investor and energy
researcher based in Singapore, told me.<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
China produces almost 30% of the world’s hydropower, but output in the
country has fallen in recent years due to declines in rainfall. China
produced some 1,226 terawatt hours of hydro power in 2023, according to
the
<a href="https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review" target="_blank"><u>2024
Statistical Review of World Energy</u></a>, down about 5% from 1,298 in
2022 and down substantially from the recent maximum output of 1,322 in
2020. From 2013 to 2023, Chinese hydro output grew by about a third, a 3
percent annual growth rate, during that same period,
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-generation?tab=chart&country=~CHN" target="_blank"><u>wind
output</u></a> has grown by over 500%. Solar output, meanwhile,
increased by nearly a
<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-energy-consumption?tab=chart&country=~CHN" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>factor
of 70</u></a>.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Even in spite of this phenomenal growth in wind and solar capacity,
hydropower is still China’s largest source of clean energy, according to
the clean energy think tank Ember, responsible for 13% of its
electricity generation. Almost two-third comes from fossil fuels,
largely coal.
</p>
<p>
The country’s 2022 drought
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-23/worst-drought-in-decades-threatens-china-s-economic-recovery" target="_blank">wreaked
havoc</a> on China’s economy, with factories going idle for want of
power and cities shutting off lights in order to conserve. Globally,
hydropower output hit a five-year low in 2023, according to Ember,
largely on the back of China’s slump. This meant increased global coal
usage, driving up overall power sector emissions by 1% and preventing
what would have otherwise been a fall in global power
emissions.<del></del>
</p>
<p>
“The expectation with more hydro coming back on line is much less coal
generation,” Jeremy Wallace, a professor of China studies at Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and Heatmap
contributor, told me.
</p>
<p>
The water level in the Yangtze River has risen in the past few weeks
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/flood-fears-chinas-east-rain-swells-yangtze-river-levels-2024-07-03/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>due
to heavy rainfall</u></a>, <em>Reuters</em> reported, which is not an
unalloyed good — it could also mean more flooding and landslides
throughout the summer,
<a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202407/1315455.shtml" target="_blank"><u>government
meteorologists projected</u></a>. Floods in the Yangtze and its
tributaries are recurring and tremendous risks in China. Floods in 2011
caused by
<a href="https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2011-000059-chn" target="_blank">heavy
rain following a drought killing around 200 people</a> and displaced
<a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/featured-images/heavy-rains-record-flooding-southern-china" target="_blank">hundreds
of thousands</a>. <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
China accounts for about 26% of global emissions, so if its emissions
have indeed peaked, that would be very good news for the rest of the
world. “China’s economy is growing and it’s using more electricity,”
Wallace told me<em>,</em> “but almost all of that electricity growth has
been from clean sources.”<br/>
</p>
<p>
China’s carbon dioxide emissions fell slightly in March of this year
after rising steadily following the end of its zero-Covid policy in
2022, according to an
<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-monthly-drop-hints-that-chinas-co2-emissions-may-have-peaked-in-2023/#:~:text=The%20new%20analysis%20for%20Carbon,could%20have%20peaked%20in%202023." target="_blank">analysis

by Lauri Myllyvirta, a senior fellow at Asia Society Policy Institute
and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.
That is due in part to the government’s investments in non-emitting
energy — 423 terawatt hours per year installed in 2023 alone, “equal to
the total electricity consumption of France,” per Myllyvirta’s analysis
— and in other part to a transformation in its industrial balance.
</p>
<p>
Over the past few years, China’s economic engine has shifted from urban
construction, dependent on emissions-heavy steel and cement, towards
relatively less carbon-intensive manufacturing, Wallace said.
</p>
<p>
Turnbull shared a similar take. “All the sectors which comprised all the
ferocious power demand growth” are “going down” or are “flat to
down-ish,” he said, referring to industrial sectors like steel.
Meanwhile, “the demand side doesn’t look like it’s growing anywhere near
like it is before.”
</p>
<p>
“I think this is it,” Turnbull said. “This is the peak.”

seeks to boost scrutiny on property deals near military facilities</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The United States plans to broaden oversight of
foreigners’ real estate transactions on properties close to military
installations, the Treasury Department said Monday, as concerns
involving Chinese land purchases grow. </p>
<p>“President [Joe] Biden and I remain committed to using our strong
investment screening tool to defend America’s national security,
including actions that protect military installations from external
threats,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. </p>
<p>Under a proposed rule, more than 50 facilities will be added to a
list of sites where surrounding property transactions may be reviewed by
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) —
taking the total figure to 227. </p>
<p>CFIUS’s jurisdiction covers land purchases as well. </p>
<p>The concern is that a foreigner’s purchase or lease of certain
properties could allow them to collect intelligence or “expose national
security activities” to foreign surveillance risks, the Treasury
noted. </p>
<p>A senior Treasury official said CFIUS’s jurisdiction was
“country-agnostic” and did not specify if the latest rule was aimed at
quelling concerns directed at specific countries like China or
Russia. </p>
<p>In May, U.S. authorities announced that a Chinese-owned crypto firm
was barred from using land near a strategic U.S. nuclear missile base,
over national security concerns. </p>
<p>MineOne Partners Limited was ordered to divest from land it bought in
2022, which sat less than a mile from Wyoming’s Francis E. Warren Air
Force Base — home to Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic
missiles. </p>
<p>CFIUS had also raised concerns about the installation of
“specialized” crypto mining equipment on the land which is “potentially
capable of facilitating surveillance and espionage activities.”</p>

<h2 id="takeaways-from-our-sunzia-investigation">3 Takeaways From Our
SunZia Investigation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: Heatmap News</p>
<img src="https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjUwMzEzMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyNjg0MDI3NH0.hOWgyJa00K8j_57I3vbJWajbXaM-vmMIdpM5ZrIE574/image.jpg?width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0"/><br/><br/>
<p class="drop-caps">
How hard is it to build big clean-energy infrastructure in America?
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>Look at
SunZia.</u></a>
</p>
<p>
When completed, the more-than-500-mile power line is meant to ferry
electricity from a massive new wind farm in New Mexico to the booming
power markets of Arizona and California. When finally built, SunZia will
be the largest renewable project in the United States, if not the
Western Hemisphere.
</p>
<p>
But as I detail in
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>a recent
investigation</u></a> for Heatmap, it has taken too long — much too long
— to build. Nearly two decades have elapsed since a project developer
first asked the federal government for permission to build SunZia.
</p>
<p>
Since it was first proposed, SunZia has endured seemingly endless
environmental studies and lawsuits. It has been bought, sold, and
bargained over. The end result is that a project first conceived in 2006
— which was expected to operate in 2013 — is now due to open in 2026.
</p>
<p>
That is a massive problem, because confronting climate change will
require the country to build dozens of new long-distance power lines
like SunZia. If the United States wants to meet its Paris Agreement goal
by 2050, then it will have to triple the size of its power grid in just
26 years, according to
<a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Princeton’s
Net Zero America study</u></a>. (That research was led by Jesse Jenkins,
who co-hosts Heatmap’s
<a href="https://heatmap.news/podcast/shift-key-robinson-meyer-jesse-jenkins-climate-podcast" target="_self"><u>“Shift
Key”</u></a> podcast with me.)
</p>
<p>
The country is not on track to meet that goal.
<a href="https://heatmap.news/economy/sunzia" target="_self"><u>My
story</u></a> on SunZia set out to determine why.
</p>
<p>
Here are three major takeaways from my investigation:
</p>
<h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Transmission projects face more obstacles than fossil fuel projects
— even in the eyes of self-described environmentalists.
</h2>
<p>
At a fundamental level, a power line and a natural gas pipeline aren’t
so different: Both move a large amount of energy over a long distance.
</p>
<p>
Yet it is much easier to build a natural gas pipeline than a
transmission line, and they face very different regulatory hurdles in
America. When a company proposes a new transmission line, it must get
permission from every state whose borders it plans to cross. This can
result in an arduous, years-long process of application, study, and
approval.
</p>
<p>
That same obstacle does not hinder gas developers. When a company
proposes a new natural gas pipeline, it can get many of its permits
handled by a single federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. FERC is a one-stop shop for gas pipeline developers,
organizing and granting state-level permits through a streamlined
process.
</p>
<p>
(To be sure, natural gas pipelines sometimes need permits from other
federal agencies — such as the Bureau of Land Management — before they
can begin construction. But transmission developers need to get<em>
</em>permits from those other federal agencies, too.)
</p>
<p>
But not all of the obstacles are regulatory. Transmission and renewable
projects simply <em><em>look </em></em>different than pipelines, which
can make environmentalists and the public more skeptical of them. Even
though pipelines can leak or spill, they can be buried or built closer
to the ground than power lines, and therefore pose less of a visual
disturbance to the landscape.
</p>
<p>
In recent years, much of the controversy around SunZia has focused on
the San Pedro Valley, a gorgeous desert landscape northeast of Tucson,
Arizona. SunZia must pass through the valley to connect to a power
station near Phoenix.
</p>
<p>
Two Native American tribes — the Tohono O’odham Nation and the San
Carlos Apache Tribe — sued to block SunZia last year. They argue that
the valley has cultural value and must be preserved intact and
undiminished.
</p>
<p>
But the valley is already home to a large natural gas pipeline, mostly —
but not entirely — buried underground. (The pipeline is on pylons near
Redington, Arizona, where it crosses the San Pedro River.)
</p>
<p>
In an interview, a leader at the Center for Biological Diversity, an
environmentalist group that joined the tribes’ lawsuit, said that
SunZia’s proposed power line is problematic in part because it will be
so tall.
</p>
<p>
“There are no 200-foot large power lines going through the San Pedro
Valley,” Robin Silver, the leader, told me. “The gas pipeline doesn’t
have 200 foot towers.”
</p>
<p>
If environmentalists focus on a project’s visual prominence, then
pipelines will virtually always win out over transmission lines.
</p>
<p>
A federal judge dismissed the tribes’ lawsuit last month. A
representative of the Tohono O’odham Nation did not respond to multiple
requests for comment.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>A better relationship between conservationists and clean energy
developers is possible.
</h2>
<p>
In permitting debates, conservationists and clean energy developers can
often become enemies. Traditional conservationists seek to slow down the
permitting process as much as possible and move a project away from a
treasured or sensitive area, while developers and climate hawks want to
build clean energy infrastructure quickly and efficiently.
</p>
<p>
These fights often play out as costly lawsuits over the National
Environmental Policy Act, a 1970 law that requires the government to
study the environmental impact of every decision that it makes.
Advocates and opponents wind up battling in court over whether or not a
project’s environmental impact has been sufficiently studied.
</p>
<p>
That’s not what happened with SunZia. Some environmentalists and
traditional conservation groups, such as the Audubon Society, now praise
SunZia’s process.
</p>
<p>
It wasn’t always that way. During the early 2010s, SunZia’s proposal to
cross the Rio Grande in New Mexico was just as controversial as its San
Pedro Valley route. The project’s developer wanted to build power lines
near a site where tens of thousands of migratory birds, including
<a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Sandhill_Crane/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>sandhill
cranes</u></a>, spend the winter.
</p>
<p>
That changed after the Defense Department forced a major rethink of the
line in 2018. Soon after that, Pattern Energy, a San Francisco-based
energy developer, took over the project.
</p>
<p>
Pattern took a different approach than its predecessor and partnered
with environmental groups to learn how it could build the power line in
the least intrusive way.
</p>
<p>
It conducted original research on how sandhill cranes fly, and — based
on that research — moved the power line to the place where it would
interfere with birds the least. It also purchased and donated an old
farm property and the accompanying water rights so a wildlife refuge
could rebuild habitat for the birds.
</p>
<p>
Pattern also agreed to illuminate the transmission line with an
experimental infrared system to make it more visible to birds.
</p>
<p>
These changes, which also allowed Pattern to avoid a Defense Department
site, were so extensive that it had to apply for a new federal permit.
</p>
<p>
“Pattern being a company that was willing to have discussions with us in
good faith — and that conversation happening before the re-permitting
process — was, I think, really important,” Jon Hayes, a wildlife
biologist and the executive director of Audubon Southwest, told me.
</p>
<h2>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>But someone has to facilitate it.<br/>
</h2>
<p>
This collaborative relationship was possible in part because it was
facilitated by Senator Martin Heinrich, a Democrat who represents New
Mexico.
</p>
<p>
Heinrich, a climate hawk and the son of a utility worker, had long
championed the SunZia project. So when the project ran into obstacles,
he pushed the developer, environmentalists, and the Pentagon to
negotiate over a better solution. His office remained deeply involved in
the process throughout the 2010s, ultimately helping to broker an
agreement over the Rio Grande that all parties supported.
</p>
<p>
“I firmly believe that when we work together, we can build big things in
this country,” Heinrich told me in a statement.
</p>
<p>
Silver, the Center for Biological Diversity leader, told me that
Heinrich’s involvement is the principal reason why SunZia has been
praised in New Mexico but criticized in Arizona.
</p>
<p>
The Grand Canyon State doesn’t have elected officials who were willing
to get involved in SunZia and push for a mutually beneficial solution,
he said. (For much of the 2010s, Republicans held both of the state’s
Senate seats.)
</p>
<p>
But a project’s ultimate success cannot rest on the quality or curiosity
of its senators. Martin Heinrich, as a climate solution, doesn’t scale,
and not every clean energy project will have a federal chaperone.
</p>
<p>
What’s more, America’s existing permitting system — which is channeled
through its adversarial legal system — practically discourages
cooperation. It pushes developers and their opponents to pursue
aggressive and expensive legal campaigns against each other. These
campaigns burn huge amounts of time and millions of dollars in legal
fees — money that could be spent on decarbonizing the economy.
</p>
<p>
In order to meet America’s climate goals, developers must build dozens
of projects like SunZia, all around the country, in the years to come.
That will not happen under today’s permitting system. The country needs
something better.

<p>
You may have gotten the unsolicited texts, LinkedIn messages or other
offers from scammers posing as recruiters. The may even have a
legitimate-looking listing on a job hiring site. You have a virtual
interview, then the recruiter starts asking for personal information
like your Social Security number to fill out “employment paperwork” —
but actually they’re stealing your identity. Plus, examining the Sahm
Rule and use of the U.S. dollar in Lebanon.

the next version of OSNews</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Despite being live since 1997, OSNews has had fairly few redesigns in
the grand scheme of things. If my memory serves me correctly, we’ve had
a grand total of 6 designs, and we’re currently on version 6, introduced
about 5 years ago because of unpleasant reasons. It’s now 2024, and for
a variety of reasons, we’re looking to work towards version 7 of our
almost 30 year old website, and we need help. I have a very clear idea
of what I want OSNews 7 to be like – including mockups. The general
goals are making the site visually simpler, reducing our dependency on
WordPress extensions, and reducing the complexity of our theme and
website elements to make it a bit easier for someone like me to change
small things without breaking anything. Oh and a dark mode that works.
Note that we’re not looking to change backends or anything like that –
WordPress will stay. If you have the WordPress, design, and developer
skills to make something like this a reality, and in the process shape
the visual identity of one of the oldest continuously running technology
news websites in the world, send me an email.</p>

“You’re an animal, Sibling Dex. You are not separate or other. You’re an
animal. And animals have no purpose. Nothing has a purpose. The world
simply is. If you want to do things that are meaningful to others, fine!
Good! So do I! But if I wanted to crawl into a cave and watch
stalagmites with Frostfrog for the remainder of my days, that would also
be both fine and good. You keep asking why your work is not enough, and
I don’t know how to answer that, because it is enough to exist in the
world and marvel at it. You don’t need to justify that, or earn it. You
are allowed to just live. That is all most animals do.”

<p>
I tend to read whatever the opposite of cozy science fiction is: angry
and worried about the world, building tension from speculative
extrapolations of what could go wrong. This, on the other hand, is
science fiction that encourages you to just <em>chill</em> for a minute.
</p>
<p>
I don’t know if I could read a lot of this, because I <em>am</em> angry
and worried about the world, and reading other peoples’ words along the
same lines is cathartic. But the message here — that you don’t need to
justify yourself, that you can just <em>be</em> — is soothing, and was
necessary for me. And it’s all done with wit and care. What a delightful
novella.

A lawsuit playing out this week in a New Orleans appeals court could be

particular case</a>, 25 Republican-led states are challenging a rule
from the U.S. Department of Labor that says employee retirement plans
can consider ESG factors when deciding where to invest. Conservatives
have argued this amounts to politicizing investment decisions. A Texas
judge refused to block the rule in 2022, citing Chevron, but now the
landscape looks very different. “The trial court expressly relying on
Chevron in upholding the ESG regulation … puts this case on track to be
an early harbinger of how courts will address pending cases,” said Julie
Stapel, a lawyer with the firm Morgan Lewis &amp; Bockius. The court
will begin to hear arguments tomorrow. The fall of Chevron is expected
to make it harder for federal agencies to regulate environmental hazards

its ban on onshore wind farms just days after a new Labour government

planning policy that required onshore wind projects to prove local
communities did not object to new turbines. The new chancellor, Rachel
Reeves, called the rule “absurd.” The Labour Party has pledged to double
onshore wind energy by 2030 and decarbonize the power sector completely
on that same time frame.

“It’s where the Industrial Revolution began in the 18th century, giving
rise to a global economy driven by coal, oil and gas and with it, the
emissions of planet-heating greenhouse gases. So the speed and scale of
Britain’s energy transition is likely to be closely watched by other
industrialized countries and emerging economies alike.”

<h2 id="getting-the-most-out-of-twm-x11s-default-window-manager">Getting
the most out of TWM, X11’s default window manager</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: OS News</p>
<p>Graham’s TWM page has been around for like two decades or so and
still isn’t even remotely as old as TWM itself, and in 2021 they
published an updated version with even more information, tips, and
tricks for TWM. The Tab Window Manager finds its origins in the lat
1980s, and has been the default window manager for the X Windowing
System for a long time, now, too. Yet, few people know it exists – how
many people even know X has a default window manager? – and even fewer
people know you can actually style it, too. OK, so TWM is fairly easy to
configure but alot of people, upon seeing the default config, scream
‘Ugh, thats awful!’ and head off to the ports tree or their distro
sources in search of the latest and greatest uber desktop environment.
There are some hardcore TWM fans and mimimalists however who stick
around and get to liking the basic feel of TWM. Then they start to mod
it and create their own custom dekstop. All part of the fun in Unix :).
↫ Graham’s TWM page I’ll admit I have never used TWM properly, and
didn’t know it could be themed at all. I feel very compelled to spend
some time with it now, because I’ve always liked the by-now classic
design where the right-click desktop menu serves as the central location
for all your interactions with the system. There are quite a few more
advanced, up-to-date forks of TWM as well, but the idea of sticking to
the actual default X window manager has a certain charm. I almost am too
afraid to ask, because the answer on OSNews to these sorts of questions
is almost always “yes” – do we have any TWM users in the audience? I’m
extremely curious to find out if TWM actually has a reason to exist at
this point, or if, in 2024, it’s just junk code in the X.org source
repository, because I’m looking at some of these screenshots and I feel
a very strong urge to give it a serious go.</p>

now is that when I click to drag an icon from a lower Dolphin window to
a higher one, it brings the lower window forward, but then, when I hover
for a bit over the other window, it brings it back up. Of course, this
only works if the destination window remains at least partially visible,
which might not always be the case. For usability’s sake, there needs to
be an option to start a drag operation from one window to the next
without altering the Z-order.</p>

id="review-of-prescribed-fires-finds-gaps-in-key-areas-as-us-forest-service-looks-to-improve-safety">Review
of prescribed fires finds gaps in key areas as US Forest Service looks
to improve safety</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Two years after the U.S. Forest Service sparked
what would become the largest and most destructive wildfire in New
Mexico’s recorded history, independent investigators say there are gaps
that need to be addressed if the agency is to be successful at using
prescribed fire as a tool to reduce risk amid climate change.  </p>
<p>The investigation by the Government Accountability Office was
requested by U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández after communities in her
district were ravaged in 2022 by the Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon
Fire.  </p>
<p>The congresswoman wanted to know what factors the Forest Service had
identified as contributing to the escape of prescribed fires over the
last decade and whether the agency was following through with reforms
promised after a pause and review of its prescribed burn program.  </p>
<p>The report made public Monday notes there were 43 escapes documented
between 2012 and 2021 out of 50,000 prescribed fire projects. That
included blazes in national forests in more than a dozen states, from
the California-Nevada border to Utah, New Mexico, Idaho, North Carolina
and Arkansas.  </p>
<p>With the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies
tapping into federal infrastructure and inflation reduction funding to
boost the number of prescribed burn operations over the next 10 years,
Leger Fernández said it’s more important than ever to ensure they are
doing it safely.  </p>
<p>The congresswoman was visiting northern New Mexico over recent days,
appreciating how things have greened up with summer rains. But the
forests are still tinder boxes, she said.  </p>
<p>“We need to address our forest, but we need to do it in a responsible
way,” she told The Associated Press. “When you play with fire, there is
no margin for error.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Forest Service ignites about 4,500 prescribed fires each year,
reducing fuels on about 1.3 million acres. It’s part of a multi-billion
dollar cleanup of forests choked with dead trees and undergrowth.  </p>
<p>There have been mixed results as federal land managers have fallen
behind on some projects and skipped over some highly at-risk communities
to work in less threatened ones, according to a 2023 AP review of data,
public records and congressional testimony.  </p>
<p>However, the Forest Service said in a response to the GAO that it is
making progress and generally agrees with the findings made public
Monday. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore wrote that his agency will
create and implement a corrective action plan to address the gaps.  </p>
<p>Moore also noted 2023 marked a record year for treatments of
hazardous fuels on forest lands and his agency was on track to offer
more training to build up crews who can specialize in prescribed burn
operations.  </p>
<p>“The agency is using every tool available to reduce wildfire risk at
a pace and scale which will make a difference within our current means,”
Moore wrote.  </p>
<p>The GAO reviewed volumes of documents over several months,
interviewed forest officials and made site visits over many months. The
investigation found the Forest Service has taken steps toward
implementing several immediate recommended changes following the
Hermit’s Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. That included developing a national
strategy for mobilizing resources for prescribed fire projects.  </p>
<p>There were dozens of other actions the agency identified as part of
its 2022 review, but the GAO found “important gaps remain” as the Forest
Service hasn’t determined the extent to which it will implement the
remaining actions, including how or when.  </p>
<p>The GAO is recommending the Forest Service develop a plan for
implementing the reforms, set goals, establish a way to measure progress
and ensure it has enough resources dedicated to day-to-day management of
the reform effort. It also pointed out that the Forest Service in agency
documents recognized the reforms will require major changes to practices
and culture.  </p>
<p>Leger Fernández said she hopes change will come quickly because
wildfires are becoming more expensive and more dangerous.  </p>
<p>“They are killer fires now. They move very fast, and people cannot
get out of the way fast enough,” she said. “And I think that kind of
massive emergency that they are will lead to faster change than you
might normally see in a large federal bureaucracy.”</p>

<p class="drop-caps">
There are some things money can’t buy, and it seems a clean power grid
is one of them. Despite authorizing billions of dollars to subsidize
renewable energy development through the Inflation Reduction Act and the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Biden administration remains off
track to reach its target of
<a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/DOE%20-%20100%25%20Clean%20Electricity%20-%20Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>100%

<a href="https://energyinnovation.org/publication/reaching-90-percent-clean-electricity-in-the-us-by-2035/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>half
the rate that is needed</u></a>.
</p>
<p>
Among the barriers holding up clean energy deployment, local opposition
looms large. As developers seek out new sites on which to build wind and
solar, they are repeatedly
<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/23022024/community-opposition-and-grid-challenges-slow-pace-of-renewable-efforts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>finding
themselves at odds</u></a> with neighbors who object to their projects
on aesthetic, economic, or political grounds. Whether through
<a href="https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1201&context=sabin_climate_change" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>formal
laws</u></a> or protracted permitting processes, these objections have
begun to have a noticeable effect on the pace of renewable energy
adoption. In a
<a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/news/larg-e-scale-wind-and-solar" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent
survey</u></a> by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, wind and
solar developers reported seeing roughly a third of their siting
applications canceled over the five years prior, with two of the most
common reasons being “community opposition” and “local ordinances or
zoning.”
</p>
<p>
But what if the solution to this impasse has been hiding in plain sight
— or more accurately, behind a chain link fence?
</p>
<p>
The U.S. has around
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032113006199#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20about,7.3%20TWh%20from%20landfill%20gas." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>270
million acres</u></a> of so-called “marginal land,” a designation that
includes retired mines, closed landfills, former industrial facilities,
brownfield sites, and depleted or unproductive farmland. That’s around
twice the land area that would be required for a
renewables-and-nuclear-only power grid, the most land-intensive net-zero
scenario
<a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/81644.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>modeled
by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory</u></a>. These neglected
properties are more than just an eyesore for neighbors — they also
represent wasted prospects for economic development, and in many cases
pose a contamination risk to the local environment. To law professors
<a href="https://michigan.law.umich.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/our-faculty/alexandra-klass" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Alexandra
Klass</u></a> and
<a href="https://iee.psu.edu/people/hannah-wiseman" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Hannah
Wiseman</u></a>, however, they are an opportunity in disguise.
</p>
<p>
In their
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4747870" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>new
paper</u></a>, forthcoming in the <em><em>Minnesota Law
Review</em></em>, Klass and Wiseman (of the University of Michigan and
Penn State, respectively) propose directing the bulk of new clean energy
development to these marginal lands. It’s a concept they call
“repurposed energy,” and it offers a way to, in one fell swoop, avert
local objections, reclaim unproductive land, and create new
opportunities for economically dislocated communities.
</p>
<p>
It’s not a new concept — since 2008, the Environmental Protection
Agency’s
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/re-powering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>RE-Powering
America’s Land Initiative</u></a> has offered funding to developers
looking to build renewable energy on potentially contaminated land.
</p>
<p>
What the new paper proposes, however, is a greater convergence of public
benefits on this specific subset of projects, which Klass views as a
down payment on societal acceptance. “If you can come up with a project
that’s going to have community support, that means you can actually
build it,” she told me. “And that’s worth paying a little extra money up
front.”
</p>
<p>
Consider some of the most common objections to renewable energy siting:
that it
<a href="https://whyy.org/articles/offshore-wind-critics-say-farms-will-damage-shore-economies-and-ruin-ocean-views/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ruins
the view</u></a>,
<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/outdoors/2024/03/02/wisconsin-prairie-chickens-threatened-by-proposed-solar-farm-along-buena-vista-state-wildlife-area/72803144007/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disrupts
habitats</u></a>, or
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/solar-capacity-grows-some-americas-most-productive-farmland-is-risk-2024-04-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>occupies
valuable farmland</u></a>. Each would seem to carry less weight when
applied to, say, an abandoned mine instead of a pristine coastline.
Throw in low purchase prices, pre-existing transmission lines at retired
coal or gas power plants, and the chance to direct jobs and revenue to
low-income communities (where contaminated properties are
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ej-research/epa-research-environmental-justice-and-contaminated-sites#:~:text=Low%2Dincome%2C%20tribal%2C%20indigenous,increased%20exposures%20to%20environmental%20hazards." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>disproportionately
located</u></a>), and you’ve got, in theory, an attractive site for a
solar or wind farm.
</p>
<p>
In spite of these upsides, practical examples of repurposed energy
remain few and far between. Only 0.7% of the renewable energy capacity
installed in the United States since 1997 has been on reclaimed land,
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/re-powering" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>according
to EPA data</u></a>. That’s because, faced with the possibility of
extravagant cleanup costs and liability for prior contamination, most
developers prefer to take their chances with a greenfield.
</p>
<p>
Klass and Wiseman propose a set of policy changes that could, they hope,
spur a renewable energy renaissance on marginal lands. First, there are
some existing incentives for repurposed energy they propose expanding.
Certain state funding programs – like Massachusetts’ SMART Program – and
streamlined permitting processes – like New York’s Build-Ready Program –
could offer a template for other states seeking to accelerate
redevelopment of their own brownfields. Layering more such benefits on
top of federal funding opportunities like the IRA’s Energy
Infrastructure and Reinvestment Program, they contend, could help
stimulate broader interest from developers.
</p>
<p>
Second, they offer a set of new, more ambitious reforms to entice clean
energy companies onto marginal lands. Among them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Giving the Department of Energy direct permitting authority over
repurposed energy would require an act of Congress, but could accelerate
approvals. Klass and Wiseman point out that many sites containing
hazardous chemicals may already be in the federal regulatory sphere.
</li>
<li>
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could direct regional
transmission organizations to grant repurposed energy projects priority
in interconnection queues, bypassing a lengthy part of the development
timeline.
</li>
<li>
State offices that oversee brownfield cleanup and development could
establish separate divisions for repurposed energy, better equipping
them to deal with and resolve clean energy developers’ unique needs.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Klass sees the paper as a timely contribution at a critical juncture for
the renewable energy industry. “We’re at an important moment in time
where there’s a lot of federal funding available,” she told me. “But we
are not on track to build the amount of clean energy we need to meet our
targets.” By focusing support on repurposed energy, she thinks
policymakers may be able to erode some of the sociopolitical barriers
holding back the industry.
</p>
<p>
There is evidence to support this belief. A
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620304485" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>2021
study</u></a> found that objections to wind farms tended to fade when
the infrastructure was sited in areas with fewer lakes, hills, or other
features of aesthetic or recreational value, suggesting that plants
sited on already-disturbed land might indeed arouse less opposition.
“You start with these types of projects that we hope will engender less
community opposition and provide more community benefits,” Klass said.
“Maybe you scale it up later, maybe you don’t. But it allows a pathway
through some of this local opposition.”
</p>
<p>
It’s a view that resonates in the industry, although that doesn’t make
this kind of development easy. Jonathan Mancini is the senior vice
president of solar project development at
<a href="https://www.ameresco.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ameresco</u></a>,
which has built solar on around 20 landfills across the United States.
He told me that sites with soil contamination are capped with an
impermeable barrier to prevent the hazardous material from spreading,
and building a solar farm on top requires using bespoke racking systems
that won’t penetrate that cap. On top of that, would-be developers have
to employ third-party engineers to monitor the cap’s integrity and
undergo additional reviews by state regulators to ensure that the weight
of the solar system will not damage it. “Currently, the permitting
timeline for such projects takes up to three years to complete,” he told
me.
</p>
<p>
Dedicated state support in places like Massachusetts, Illinois, and
Maryland has helped Ameresco alleviate some of the costs. “Utility
programs or state administered programs do incentivize the use of these
types of projects,” Mancini said. But he noted that more support would
be helpful to overcome the barriers repurposed energy projects face.
“Additional policy measures at the local and/or state level would make
these projects move faster through permitting and approval.”
</p>
<p>
Michael Gerrard, the founder of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for
Climate Change Law and one of the country’s foremost environmental
lawyers, thinks the idea could accelerate clean energy deployment.
“Local opposition is one of the most important impediments [to renewable
energy],” he pointed out to me. By undercutting aesthetic and land use
concerns, repurposed energy could “have a very positive impact finding
ways to reduce that,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Gerrard also noted, however, that local opposition is not the only
barrier to renewable energy development. In addition to more stringent
permitting requirements, “transmission, interest rates, supply chains,
local content restrictions, workforce shortages — all of those are
impediments,” he said. Repurposed energy is no magic bullet, he added,
but it doesn’t have to be. “We need a lot of magic buckshot,” he said,
“and this article proposes quite a few pellets.”

chief: Quickest way to end Ukraine war is to lose it; but won’t bring
peace</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>WASHINGTON — As NATO prepares to convene on Tuesday a three-day
summit in Washington to celebrate its 75th birthday, the alliance is
reinforcing its support for Ukraine in the ongoing war with Russia.</p>
<p>During a news conference with a handful of reporters Sunday
previewing the summit, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said all
NATO members want peace, and that can be achieved if Russian President
Vladimir Putin understands he cannot win on the battlefield.</p>
<p>“The quickest way to end this war is to lose the war,” he said. “But
that that will not bring peace. That will bring occupation.”</p>
<p>Stoltenberg outlined key measures NATO would take, including the
establishment of a dedicated command in Germany, enhanced financial and
military aid, and bilateral security agreements.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg emphasized these initiatives while addressing the
complexities of Ukraine’s potential NATO membership and the alliance’s
united front against Russian aggression.</p>
<p>The precise language of the final agreement of the summit regarding
Ukraine’s NATO membership is still under negotiation, he said.</p>
<p>In April, Stoltenberg said the alliance did not expect to offer
Ukraine NATO membership during the summit, but rather a “bridge” to
membership.</p>
<p>At the summit, that “bridge” will encompass five essential
components:</p>
<p>Security assistance command: NATO is setting up a new command in
Germany, with logistical hubs in Eastern Europe, to coordinate
international security assistance for Ukraine. This will involve 700
personnel led by a three-star NATO general, according to
Stoltenberg.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg said there have been differences among allies about “the
approach or types of weapons Ukraine should be delivered.” Those
differences create bureaucratic delays, and the goal is to make delivery
faster and easier.</p>
<p>“This new command will have a very robust mandate, so there will be
no need for consensus on each and every delivery,” he said.</p>
<p>Financial pledge: Since February 2022, NATO allies have provided
around $43 billion annually in military support to Ukraine. The upcoming
summit is expected to extend this commitment for another year, laying a
foundation for future support.</p>
<p>Immediate weapon deliveries: Announcements on delivering more weapons
and ammunition, particularly air defense systems, are anticipated at the
summit to bolster Ukraine’s defense.</p>
<p>While the secretary-general did not offer specifics, a senior U.S.
official indicated that announcements can be expected from NATO allies
this week regarding the provision of F-16 aircraft to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Bilateral security agreements: Twenty NATO allies will have signed
bilateral security agreements with Ukraine by the start of the summit,
offering additional security guarantees and reinforcing collaborative
defense efforts.</p>
<p>Interoperability: Efforts are underway to align Ukrainian armed
forces with NATO standards, including a joint training center in Poland
and programs on military acquisitions and procurement.</p>
<p>Hungary won’t participate or obstruct</p>
<p>Stoltenberg addressed concerns about Hungary’s stance on Russia’s war
in Ukraine and its potential to block NATO decisions.</p>
<p>He recounted a recent visit to Budapest, where he secured an
agreement with Prime Minister Viktor Orban ensuring that Hungary will
not obstruct the proposed support measures for Ukraine.</p>
<p>Budapest will not participate in the new NATO security assistance
command for Ukraine but will fulfill its other NATO obligations and
contribute to the common budget, Stoltenberg said.</p>
<p>The secretary general highlighted NATO’s diverse engagements with
Moscow even after the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>He noted a recent conversation between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd
Austin and the Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, underscoring
the routine nature of such contacts.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg said NATO must function cohesively in developing new
defense strategies, emphasizing unity despite differing perspectives,
such as those represented by leaders like Orban.</p>
<p>Future relationship with the US</p>
<p>Stoltenberg is confident that the United States would continue to be
a staunch NATO ally regardless of future election outcomes, attributing
past criticisms by former president Donald Trump primarily to defense
spending issues rather than NATO itself.</p>
<p>He emphasized that any secretary-general must be able to work with
all leaders within the alliance, comparing NATO to a big family that
every now and then has arguments and disagreements.</p>
<p>Stoltenberg recounted his experience working with presidents Barak
Obama, Trump, and Joe Biden, noting that despite differing political
leadership, the U.S. has remained a steadfast and committed NATO
ally.</p>

at Niamey</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-08, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Niamey, Niger — U.S. troops have completed a withdrawal from their
base in Niger’s capital of Niamey and will fully depart from Agadez in
the north before a Sept. 15 deadline set by the country’s military
rulers, both countries said Sunday.</p>
<p>Niger’s military leaders scrapped a military cooperation deal with
Washington in March, after seizing power in a July 2023 coup.</p>
<p>The United States had around 650 soldiers in Niger as part of
anti-jihadist missions in several Sahel nations of West Africa,
including a major drone base near Agadez.</p>
<p>“The defense ministry of Niger and the U.S. Defense Department
announce that the withdrawal of American forces and equipment from the
Niamey base 101 is now completed,” the two countries said in a
statement.</p>
<p>A final flight carrying U.S. troops was due to leave Niamey late
Sunday.</p>
<p>The U.S. presence had stood at around 950 troops, and 766 soldiers
have left Niger since the military ordered their departure, AFP learned
at a ceremony at the base attended by Niger’s army chief of staff Maman
Sani Kiaou and US General Kenneth Ekman.</p>
<p>“American forces are now going to focus on quitting airbase 201 in
Agadez,” the statement said, insisting that the withdrawal would be
completed by September 15 as planned.</p>
<p>Niger had already ordered the withdrawal of troops from France, the
former colonial power and traditional security ally, and has
strengthened ties with Russia which has provided instructors and
equipment.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Germany’s defense ministry also said it would end
operations at its airbase in Niger by August 31 following the breakdown
of talks with military leaders.</p>
<p>A similar shift has taken place in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso,
which are also ruled by military leaders and faced with violence from
jihadist groups.</p>

<p>
I’ve long been enamored by DALL-E 2’s specific flavor of visual
creativity. Especially given the text-to-image AI system’s age, it seems
to have an incredible command over color, light and dark, the abstract
and the concrete, and the emotional resonance that their careful
combination can conjure.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/dalle-2-images.jpg" alt="A 4x3 grid of diverse AI-generated artworks: abstract shapes, cosmic scenes, portraits, still life, surrealism, and landscapes, showcasing DALL-E 2&rsquo;s versatility in color, composition, and subject matter.">
</p>
<p>
<em>I picked these twelve images out of a much larger batch I generated
with DALL-E 2 automatically by combining some randomly generated
subjects with one of a few pre-written styles suffixes like “watercolor
on canvas.”</em>
</p>
<p>
Notice the use of shadows behind the body in the first image and the
impressionistic use of color in the third image in the first row. I also
love the softness of the silhouette in the top right, and the cyclops
figure that seems to emerge beyond the horizon in the second row. Even
in the most abstract images in this grid, the choice of color and
composition result in something I would personally find not at all out
of place in a gallery. There is surprising variety, creativity, and
depth to these images, especially considering most of the prompts are as
simple as <code>giving form to metaphor, watercolor on canvas</code> or
<code>a cozy bedroom, still life composition</code>.
</p>
<p>
When I try to create similar kinds of images with what I believe to be
the state-of-the-art text-to-image system today, Midjourney v6, here’s
what I get with similar prompts.
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/midjourney-images-batch-1.jpg" alt="A 4x4 grid of surreal yet highly detailed artworks: vivid abstract portraits, photorealistic hands with eyes, intricate cityscapes with cats, and lifelike sleeping figures, showcasing more intense colors, cohesive themes, and significantly higher detail than the previous collection.">
</p>
<p>
These images are beautiful in their own right, and in their detail and
realism they are impressive. I’m regularly stunned by the quality and
realism in images generated by Midjourney. This isn’t meant to be
another “AI-generated images aren’t artistic” post.
</p>
<p>
However, there <em>is</em> a very obvious difference in the styles of
these two systems. After having generated a few hundred images from both
systems, I find DALL-E 2 to be regularly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
surprising and creative with its use of color and contrast;
</li>
<li>
usually focused on a single subject, with one or few things going on in
the frame;
</li>
<li>
quite inventive in how it interprets ambiguous or open-ended prompts,
often bringing in varied appropriate subjects on its own.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
By contrast, Midjourney’s images are biased towards:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
a lot of detail all the time, almost as if the system really wants to
put every single pixel to use;
</li>
<li>
pretty uniform, flat use of color compared to DALL-E 2’s;
</li>
<li>
literal interpretations of the prompt, with a tendency to have the image
always be “about” something concrete with little room for ambiguity.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Though Midjourney v6 is the most capable system like this in my
experience, I encounter these same stylistic biases when using any
modern model from the last couple of years, like Stable Diffusion XL and
its derivatives, Google’s Imagen models, or even the current version of
DALL-E (DALL-E 3). This is a shame, because I really like the variety
and creativity of outputs from DALL-E 2, and it seems no modern systems
are capable of reproducing similar results.
</p>
<p>
I’ve also done some head-to-head comparisons, including giving
Midjourney examples of images from which it could transfer the style.
Though Midjourney v6 successfully copies the original image’s style, it
still has the hallmark richness in detail, as well as a clear tendency
towards concrete subjects like realistic human silhouettes:
</p>
<p>
<img src="https://thesephist.com/img/dalle-2-midjourney-comparison.png" alt="Side-by-side comparison of two abstract watercolor-style images: DALL-E 2 on left with simpler, isolated hand shapes; Midjourney v6 on right with more complex, blended forms and richer color palette and more realistic human forms.">
</p>
<p>
Though none of this is a scientifically rigorous study, I’ve heard
similar sentiments from other users of these systems, and observed
similar “un-creative” behavior from modern language models like ChatGPT.
In particular, I found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05587">this
study of distribution of outputs before and after preference tuning on
Llama 2</a> models interesting, because I think they successfully
quantify the bland “ChatGPT voice” and show some concrete ways that
reinforcement learning has produced
<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/t9svvNPNmFf5Qa3TA/mysteries-of-mode-collapse">accidental</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor">attractors</a> in the
model’s output space.
</p>
<p>
Why does this happen?
</p>
<p>
There are a few major differences between DALL-E 2 and other systems
that we could hypothetically point to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
They’re trained on very different datasets.
</li>
<li>
DALL-E 2 never underwent any preference tuning, where the other models
have.
</li>
<li>
DALL-E 2 is the only pixel-space image diffusion model still in wide
use. All other models perform diffusion in a compressed latent space,
which may hamper things like the diversity of color palette.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
After thinking about it a bit and playing with some open source models,
I think there are two big things going on here.
</p>
<p>
The first is that <strong>humans simply prefer brighter, more colorful,
more detailed images when asked to pick a “better” visual</strong> in a
side-by-side comparison, even though they would not necessarily prefer a
world in which every single image was so hyper-detailed and
hyper-colorful. So when models are tuned to human preferences, they
naturally produce these hyper-detailed, hyper-colorful sugar-pop images.
</p>
<p>
The second is that when a model is trained using a method with feedback
loops like reinforcement learning, it tends towards “attractors”, or
preferred modes in the output space, and stops being an accurate model
of reality in which every concept is proportionately represented in its
output space. <strong>Preference tuning tunes models away from being
accurate reflections of reality</strong> into being greedy
reward-seekers happy to output a boring response if it expects the
boring output to be rated highly.
</p>
<p>
Let’s investigate these ideas in more detail.
</p>
<h2 id="1-are-we-comparing-outputs-or-comparing-worlds">
<ol type="1">
<li>Are we comparing outputs, or comparing worlds?
</h2>
<p>
If you’ve ever walked into an electronics store and looked at a wall
full of TVs or listened to headphones on display, you’ll notice they’re
all tuned to the brightest, loudest, most vibrant settings. Sometimes,
the colors are so vibrant they make pictures look a bit unrealistic,
with perfectly turquoise oceans and perfectly tan skin.
</p>
<p>
In general, when asked to compare images or music, people with untrained
eyes and ears will pick the brightest images and the loudest music.
Bright images create the illusion of vibrant colors and greater detail,
and make other images that are less bright seem dull. Loud music has a
similar effect, giving rise to a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war">“loudness war”</a>
on public radio where tracks compete to catch listeners’ attention by
being louder than other tracks before or after it.
</p>
<p>
Now, we are also in a loudness war of synthetic media.
</p>
<p>
Another way to think about this phenomenon is as a failure to align
<em>what we are asking human labelers to compare</em> with <em>what we
actually want to compare</em>.
</p>
<p>
When we build a preference dataset, what we should actually be asking
is, “Is a world with a model trained on this dataset preferable to a
world with a model trained on that dataset?” Of course, this is an
intractable question to ask, because doing so would require somehow
collecting human labels on every possible arrangement of a training
dataset, leading to a combinatorial explosion of options. Instead, we
approximate this by collecting human preference signals on each
individual data point. But there’s a mismatch: just because humans
prefer a more detailed image in one instance doesn’t mean that we’d
prefer a world where every single image was maximally detailed.

<li>Building attractors out of world models
</h2>
<p>
Preference tuning methods like RLHF and DPO are fundamentally different
from the kind of supervised training that goes on during model
pretraining or a “basic” fine-tuning run with labelled data, because
methods like RL and DPO involve feeding the model’s output back into
itself, creating a feedback loop.
</p>
<p>
Whenever there are feedback loops in a system, we can study its
<em>dynamics</em> — over time, as we iterate towards infinity, does the
system settle into some state of stability? Does it settle into a loop?
Does it diverge, accelerating towards some limit?
</p>
<p>
In the case of systems like ChatGPT and Midjourney, these models appear
to converge under feedback loops into a few
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractor">attractors</a>, parts
of the output space that the model has deemed reliably preferred, “safe”
options. One attractor, for example, is a hyper-realistic detailed style
of illustration. Another seems to be a fondness for geometric lines and
transhumanist imagery when asked to generate anything abstract and
vaguely positive.
</p>
<p>
I think recognizing this difference between base models and
feedback-tuned models is important, because this kind of a preference
tuning step changes what the model is doing at a fundamental level. A
pretrained base model is an <strong>epistemically calibrated world
model</strong>. It’s <strong>epistemically calibrated</strong>, meaning
its output probabilities exactly mirror frequency of concepts and styles
present in its training dataset. If 2% of all photos of waterfalls also
have rainbows, exactly 2% of photos of waterfalls the model generates
will have rainbows. It’s also a <strong>world model</strong>, in the
sense that what results from pretraining is a probabilistic model of
observations of the world (its training dataset). Anything we can find
in the training dataset, we can also expect to find in the model’s
output space.
</p>
<p>
Once we subject the model to preference tuning, however, the model
transforms into something very different, a function that greedily and
cleverly finds a way to interpret every input into a version of the
request that includes elements it knows is most likely to result in a
positive rating from a reviewer. Within the constraints of a given
input, a model that’s undergone RLHF is no longer an accurate world
model, but a function whose sole job is to find a way to render a
version of the output that’s super detailed, very colorful, extremely
polite, or whatever else the model has learned will please the recipient
of its output. These reliably-rewarded concepts become attractors in the
model’s output space. See also the apocryphal story about OpenAI’s model
optimized for positive outputs, resulting in
<a href="https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/t9svvNPNmFf5Qa3TA/mysteries-of-mode-collapse#Inescapable_wedding_parties">inescapable
wedding parties</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today’s most effective tools for producing useful, obedient models
irreversibly take away something quite valuable that base models have by
construction: its epistemic calibration to the world it was trained on.
</p>
<h2 id="interpretable-models-enable-useful-ai-without-mode-collapse">
Interpretable models enable useful AI without mode collapse
</h2>
<p>
Though I find any individual output from ChatGPT or Midjourney useful
and sometimes even beautiful, I can’t really say the same about the
possibility space of outputs from these models at large. In tuning these
models to our pointwise preferences, it feels like we lost the variety
and creativity that enable these models to yield surprising and tasteful
outputs.
</p>
<p>
Maybe there’s a way to build useful AI systems without the downsides of
mode collapse.
</p>
<p>
Preference tuning is necessary today because of the way we currently
interact with these AI systems, as black boxes which take human input
and produce some output. To bend these black boxes to our will, we must
reprogram their internals to want to yield output we prefer.
</p>
<p>
But there’s another growing paradigm for interacting with AI systems,
one where we <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/prism">directly
manipulate concepts within a model’s internal feature space</a> to
elicit outputs we desire. Using these methods, we no longer have to
subject the model to a damaging preference tuning process. We can search
the model’s concept space directly for the kinds of outputs we desire
and sample them directly from a base model. Want a sonnet about the
future of quantum computing that’s written from the perspective of a
cat? Locate those concepts within the model, activate them
mechanistically, and sample the model outputs. No instructions
necessary.
</p>
<p>
Mechanistic steering like this is still early in research, and for now
we have to make do with simpler tasks like changing the topic and
writing style of short sentences. But I find this approach very
promising because it could give us a way to make pretrained models
useful without turning them into overeager human-pleasers that fall
towards an attractor at the first chance they get.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, sampling directly from a model’s concept space allows us to
rigorously quantify qualities like <em>diversity of output</em> that we
can’t control well in currently deployed models. Want variety in your
outputs? Simply expand the radius around which you’re searching in the
model’s latent space.
</p>
<p>
This world — directly interacting with epistemically calibrated models
— isn’t incompatible with Midjourney-style hyper-realistic
hyper-detailed images either. Perhaps when we have in our hands a
well-understood, capable model of the world’s images we’ll find not only
all the abstract images from DALL-E 2 and all the intricate
illustrations from Midjourney, but an uncountable number of styles and
preferences in between, as many as we have time to enumerate as we
explore its vast space of knowledge.

Orleans Essence Festival wraps up 4-day celebration of Black
culture</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New Orleans, Louisiana — For 30 years, the Essence Festival of
Culture has brought together people from all walks of life and from
around the world to connect through conversation, shared experiences
and, of course, music.</p>
<p>The nation’s largest annual celebration of Black culture was set to
end Sunday with musical performances by Janet Jackson and a special
tribute to Frankie Beverly &amp; Maze, the soul band that closed the
event for the festival’s first 15 years. Beverly, now 77, has said he is
stepping away from performing live, and the group has been on a farewell
tour.</p>
<p>Others scheduled to perform included Victoria Monet, Teedra Moses,
Tank and the Bangas, Dawn Richard, SWV, Jagged Edge, Bilal and Anthony
Hamilton.</p>
<p>Barkue Tubman-Zawolo, chief of staff, talent and diasporic engagement
for Essence Ventures, told The Associated Press the festival helps
connect the global Black community.</p>
<p>“Historically, as Black people, sometimes we’re not sure where our
heritage comes from,” Tubman-Zawolo said. “America is just one place.
But within America there’s a melting pot of different Black cultures:
Africa, Latin, Europe, the Caribbean. Understanding that allows our
power to be even greater.”</p>
<p>Tubman-Zawolo said those connections could be seen throughout this
year’s Film Festival, held at the city’s convention center, where fans
heard from storytellers from Nigeria, Ghana and the Caribbean “who are
targeting our stories about us, for us, globally.”</p>
<p>She noted similar connections through the Food and Wine stage, where
discussions highlighted Caribbean and African cuisine; the Soko Market
Place, where vendors from all over the world shared their craft; and on
the Caesars Superdome stage, which spotlighted Caribbean and African
artists including Machel Montano of Trinidad and Ayra Starr of
Nigeria.</p>
<p>“All of that occurred over four days,” Tubman-Zawolo said. “But the
beauty of it is, it doesn’t stay here. (Fans) take it with them.”</p>
<p>New Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell said this year’s “We Love Us” theme
was appropriate.</p>
<p>“This whole ‘We Love Us’ theme brought us together to build
communities,” she said.</p>
<p>The festival’s impact on the city and state has surpassed $300
million, with more than 500,000 people visiting since 1994.</p>
<p>Essence started the festival as a way to celebrate 25 years of the
magazine’s history.</p>
<p>“The locals are being incorporated in a manner that we can see and
touch and feel and smell. That has been a part of the evolution of
Essence,” Cantrell said.</p>
<p>The event’s current contract ends in 2026, but Essence Ventures CEO
Caroline Wanga has said the festival’s “forever home” is New
Orleans.</p>
<p>“That’s what we believe as well,” Cantrell said. “We have a
foundation that’s been laid over 30 years. The city is always ready and
prepared to host this event and more. I think staying in New Orleans is
the best fit and best marriage, the best partnership.”</p>

envoy expresses regret over alleged military sex crimes in Okinawa</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Tokyo — U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel expressed regret
Saturday for the handling of two cases of sexual assaults allegedly
committed by American military personnel on Okinawa, which have again
stoked resentment of the heavy U.S. troop presence on the strategic
island in Japan’s far southwest.</p>
<p>The issue broke out late last month, triggering an uproar over
reports that two American service members had been charged with sexual
assaults months earlier.</p>
<p>Both cases were first reported in local media in late June. In one
arrest made in March, a member of the U.S. Air Force was charged with
the kidnapping and sexual assault of a teenager, and while in May a U.S.
Marine was arrested on charges of attempted rape resulting in injury.
Further details about the alleged victims were not released.</p>
<p>Okinawa police said they did not announce the cases out of privacy
considerations related to the victims. The Foreign Ministry, per police
decision, also did not notify Okinawa prefectural officials.</p>
<p>The cases are a reminder to many Okinawans of the 1995 rape of a
12-year-old girl by three U.S. service members, which sparked massive
protests of the U.S. presence. It led to a 1996 agreement between Tokyo
and Washington to close a key U.S. air base, although the plan has been
repeatedly delayed due to protests at the site designated for its
replacement on another part of the island.</p>
<p>Emanuel said he deeply regretted what happened to the individuals,
their families and their community, but fell short of apologizing.
“Obviously, you got to let the criminal justice process play out. But
that doesn’t mean you don’t express on a human level your sense of
regret.”</p>
<p>“We have to do better,” he said, adding that the U.S. military’s high
standards and protocols for education and training of its troops was
“just not working.”</p>
<p>Emanuel said the U.S. may be able to propose measures to improve
training and transparency with the public at U.S.-Japan foreign and
defense ministers’ security talks expected later this month in
Tokyo.</p>
<p>On Friday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the
Japanese authorities would do their utmost to provide more prompt
disclosures of alleged crime related to U.S. military personnel on
Okinawa while protecting victims’ privacy.</p>
<p>The cases could be a setback for the defense relationship at a time
when Okinawa is seen increasingly important in the face of rising
tensions with China.</p>
<p>Some 50,000 U.S. troops are deployed in Japan under a bilateral
security pact, about half of them on Okinawa, where residents have long
complained about heavy U.S. troop presence and related accidents, crime
and noise.</p>
<p>Emanuel commented on the issue while visiting Fukushima, on Japan’s
northeast coast.</p>
<p>Earlier Saturday, the ambassador visited the nearby town of
Minamisoma to join junior surfers and sample locally-caught flounder for
lunch, aiming to highlight the safety of the area’s seawater and seafood
amid ongoing discharges of treated and diluted radioactive water from
the tsunami-ruined Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>China has banned Japanese seafood over the discharges, a move Emanuel
criticized as unjustified.</p>

<p>This coming week could be consequential for U.S. President Joe
Biden’s reelection bid as voices continue to grow for him to leave the
race amid concern over his age and capacity to lead. So far however, he
still has the support of many of his peers, even as they acknowledge
Democratic voters’ worries. VOA’s Veronica Balderas Iglesias

id="despicable-me-4-debuts-raking-in-122.6-million-since-opening-wednesday">‘Despicable
Me 4’ debuts, raking in $122.6 million since opening Wednesday</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>New York — After a historically bad first half of the year, the box
office is suddenly booming.</p>
<p>“Despicable Me 4,” the Illumination Animation sequel, led the way
over the holiday weekend with $75 million in ticket sales Friday through
Sunday and $122.6 million since opening Wednesday, according to studio
estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>The Independence Day holiday weekend haul for the Universal Pictures’
release further extends the considerable box-office reign of the
Minions, arguably the most bankable force in movies today. And it also
kept a summer streak going for Hollywood.</p>
<p>Though overall ticket sales were down more than 40% from levels prior
to the COVID 19 pandemic, heading into the summer moviegoing season,
theaters have lately seen a succession of hits. After Sony’s “Bad Boys:
Ride or Die” outperformed expectations, Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” rapidly
cleared $1 billion in ticket sales worldwide, making it the first
release since “Barbie” to reach that mark. Last weekend, the Paramount
prequel “A Quiet Place: Day One” also came in above expectations.</p>
<p>With “Deadpool &amp; Wolverine” tracking for a $160 million launch
later this month, Hollywood’s summer is looking up.</p>
<p>“If you look at the mood of the industry about eight weeks ago, very
different than today,” says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for
Comscore. “The song says what a difference a day makes. What a
difference a month has made.”</p>
<p>It helps to have the Minions at your disposal. Since first debuting
in the 2010 original “Despicable Me,” each entry of the franchise —
including two sequels and two “Minions” spinoffs — has seemingly
guaranteed to gross around $1 billion. The four previous movies all made
between $939 million (2022’s “Minions: Rise of Gru”) and $1.26 billion
(2015’s “Minions”) globally.</p>
<p>That run has helped give Illumination founder and chief executive
Chris Meledandri one of the most enviable track records in Hollywood.
“Despicable Me 4,” directed by Chris Renaud and Patrick Delage, returns
the voice cast led by Steve Carell and Kristen Wiig and doubles down on
more Minion mayhem. Reviews (54% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t
particularly good for the latest installment, which includes a witness
protection plot and a group of Minions transformed into a superhero
squadron. But in their 12-year run, little has slowed down the
Minions.</p>
<p>“This is one of the most beloved franchises, quite frankly, in the
history of film, and certainly animation,” said Jim Orr, distribution
chief for Universal. “Chris Meledandri and Illumination have their
finger on the pulse of what families and audiences around the world want
to see.”</p>
<p>Family movies are powering the box office. “Despicable Me 4”
performed strongly despite the still considerable drawing power of
“Inside Out 2.” In its fourth weekend of release, the Pixar sequel added
another $30 million domestically and $78.3 million overseas.</p>
<p>“Inside Out 2,” with $1.22 billion in ticket sales thus far, is
easily the year’s biggest hit and fast climbing up the all-time ranks
for animated releases. It currently ranks as the No. 5 animated release
worldwide.</p>
<p>Instead of cannibalizing the opening weekend for “Despicable Me 4,”
“Inside Out 2” may have helped get families back in the habit of heading
to theaters.</p>
<p>“What happened, I think, is the release calendar finally settled into
a nice rhythm,” said Dergarabedian, referencing the jumbled movie
schedule from last year’s strikes. “It’s all about momentum.”</p>
<p>The continued strong sales for “Inside Out 2” were enough to put the
film in second place for the domestic weekend. Last week’s top new film,
“A Quiet Place: Day One,” slid to third with $21 million in its second
weekend, with another $21.1 million from overseas theaters. That was a
steep decrease of 60%, though the Paramount prequel has amassed $178.2
million worldwide in two weeks.</p>
<p>The run of hits has caused some studios to boost their forecasts for
the summer movie season. Heading into the most lucrative season at
theaters, analysts were predicting a $3 billion summer, down from the
more typical $4 billion mark. Now, closer to $3.4 billion appears
likely.</p>
<p>The weekend’s other top new release was Ti West’s “MaXXXine,” the
third in a string of slasher films from A24 starring Mia Goth. In 2,450
locations, “MaXXXine” collected $6.7 million in ticket sales, a
franchise best. The film, which follows “X” and “Pearl” (both released
in 2022), stars Goth as a 1980s Hollywood starlet being hunted by a
killer known as the Night Stalker.</p>
<p>Angel Studios, which last year released the unexpected summer hit
“Sound of Freedom,” struggled to find the same success with its latest
Christian film, “Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trot.” It debuted
with $3.2 million.</p>
<p>Kevin Costner’s big-budget gamble, “Horizon: An American Saga,”
didn’t do much to turn around its fortunes in its second weekend. The
first chapter in what Costner hopes will be a four-part franchise –
including a chapter two Warner Bros. will release in August – earned
$5.5 million in its second weekend. The film, which cost more than $100
million to make, has grossed $22.2 million in two weeks.</p>
<p>Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian
theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released
Monday.</p>

coastal residents told to expect power outages, flooding as Beryl moves
closer to landfall</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>MATAGORDA, TEXAS — Beryl began lashing Texas with rain and
intensifying winds Sunday as coastal residents boarded up windows, left
beach towns under evacuation orders and prepared for the powerful storm
that has already cut a deadly path through parts of Mexico and the
Caribbean.</p>
<p>Although Beryl remained a tropical storm Sunday as it churned toward
Texas, it threatened to potentially regain hurricane strength in the
warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall early Monday.
The storm was projected to come ashore in the middle of the Texas coast
around Matagorda Bay, an area about 161 kilometers (100 miles) south of
Houston, but officials cautioned the path could still change.</p>
<p>Texas officials warned the storm would cause power outages and
flooding but also expressed worry that not enough coastal residents and
beach vacationers in Beryl’s path were heeding warnings to leave.</p>
<p>“One of the things that kind of trigger our concern a little bit,
we’ve looked at all of the roads leaving the coast and the maps are
still green,” said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, who is serving as the
state’s acting governor while Gov. Greg Abbott is traveling overseas.
“So we don’t see many people leaving.”</p>
<p>Along the Texas coast, many residents and business owners took the
typical storm precautions, but also expressed uncertainty about the
storm’s intensity.</p>
<p>In Port Lavaca, Jimmy May fastened plywood over the windows of his
electrical supply company and said he wasn’t concerned about the
possible storm surge. He recalled that his business had escaped flooding
in a previous hurricane that brought a 6-meter storm surge.</p>
<p>“In town, you know, if you’re in the low-lying areas, obviously, you
need to get out of there,” he said.</p>
<p>At the nearby marina, Percy Roberts showed his neighbor Ken Waller
how to properly secure his boat as heavy winds rolled in from the bay
Sunday evening.</p>
<p>“This is actually going to be the first hurricane I’m going to be
experiencing,” Waller said, noting that he’s a little nervous but feels
safe following Roberts’ lead. “Pray for the best but expect the worst, I
guess.”</p>
<p>Farther down the coast in Freeport, Mark Richardson, a 64-year-old
retiree, said homeowners were busy “trying to tie everything down” and
worried that Beryl had people unsure about where along the Texas coast
it would make landfall. He spent Sunday morning on the beach and said
ocean swells were quickly rising.</p>
<p>“The ocean is getting very angry, very fast,” he said.</p>
<p>The earliest storm to develop into a Category 5 hurricane in the
Atlantic, Beryl caused at least 11 deaths as it passed through the
Caribbean on its way to Texas. The storm ripped off doors, windows and
roofs with devastating winds and storm surge fueled by the Atlantic’s
record warmth.</p>
<p>Three times in its one week of life, Beryl has gained 56 kph in wind
speed in 24 hours or less, the official weather service definition of
rapid intensification.</p>
<p>Beryl’s explosive growth into an unprecedented early whopper of a
storm shows the literal hot water of the Atlantic and Caribbean, and
what the Atlantic hurricane belt can expect for the rest of the storm
season, experts said.</p>
<p>Texas officials warned people along the entire coastline to prepare
for possible flooding, heavy rain and wind. The hurricane warning
extended from Baffin Bay, south of Corpus Christi, to Sargent, south of
Houston.</p>
<p>Beryl lurked as another potential heavy rain event for Houston, where
storms in recent months have knocked out power across the nation’s
fourth-largest city and flooded neighborhoods. A flash flood watch was
in effect for a wide swath of the Texas coast, where forecasters
expected Beryl to dump as much as 25 centimeters of rain in some
areas.</p>
<p>Potential storm surges between 1.22 and 2.13 meters above ground
level were forecast around Matagorda. The warnings extended to the same
coastal areas where Hurricane Harvey came ashore in 2017 as a Category 4
hurricane, far more powerful than Beryl’s expected intensity by the time
the storm reaches landfall.</p>
<p>Those looking to catch a flight out of the area could find that
option all but impossible as Beryl closed in. Hundreds of flights from
Houston’s two major commercial airports had been delayed by midafternoon
Sunday and dozens more canceled, according to FlightAware data.</p>
<p>In Corpus Christi, officials asked visitors to cut their trips short
and return home early if possible. Residents were advised to secure
homes by boarding up windows if necessary and using sandbags to guard
against possible flooding.</p>
<p>The White House said Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management
Agency had sent emergency responders, search-and-rescue teams, bottled
water, and other resources along the coast.</p>
<p>Several coastal counties called for voluntary evacuations in
low-lying areas that are prone to flooding. Local officials also banned
beach camping and urged tourists traveling on the Fourth of July holiday
weekend to move recreational vehicles from coastal parks.</p>
<p>Beryl earlier this week battered Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane,
toppling trees but causing no injuries or deaths before weakening to a
tropical storm as it moved across the Yucatan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Before hitting Mexico, Beryl wrought destruction in Jamaica,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Barbados. Three people were reported
dead in Grenada, three in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, three in
Venezuela and two in Jamaica.</p>
<p>Beryl would be the 10th hurricane to hit Texas in July since 1851 and
the fourth in the last 25 years, according to Colorado State University
hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach.</p>

id="an-alaska-tourist-spot-will-vote-whether-to-ban-cruise-ships-on-saturdays-to-give-locals-a-break">An
Alaska tourist spot will vote whether to ban cruise ships on Saturdays
to give locals a break</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>JUNEAU, Alaska — Each year, a crush of tourists arrives in Alaska’s
capital city on cruise ships to see wonders like the fast-diminishing
Mendenhall Glacier. Now, long-simmering tensions over Juneau’s tourism
boom are coming to a head over a new voter initiative aimed at giving
residents a respite from the influx.</p>
<p>A measure that would ban cruise ships with 250 or more passengers
from docking in Juneau on Saturdays qualified for the Oct. 1 municipal
ballot, setting the stage for a debate about how much tourism is too
much in a city that is experiencing first-hand the impacts of climate
change. The measure would also ban ships on July 4, a day when locals
flock to a downtown parade.</p>
<p>The “ship-free Saturdays” initiative that qualified last week will go
to voters unless the local Assembly enacts a similar measure by Aug. 15,
which is seen as unlikely.</p>
<p>Juneau, accessible only by water or air, is home to the Mendenhall
Glacier, a major draw for the cruise passengers who arrive on
multi-story ships towering over parts of the modest downtown skyline.
Many residents of this city of about 32,000 have concerns about
increased traffic, congested trails and the frequent buzz of
sight-seeing helicopters transporting visitors to the Mendenhall and
other glaciers.</p>
<p>Deborah Craig, who has lived in Juneau for decades, supports
ship-free Saturdays. Craig, who lives across the channel from where the
ships dock, often hears their early-morning fog horns and broadcast
announcements made to passengers that are audible across the water.</p>
<p>The current “overwhelming” number of visitors diminishes what
residents love so much about Juneau, she said.</p>
<p>“It’s about preserving the lifestyle that keeps us in Juneau, which
is about clean air, clean water, pristine environment and easy access to
trails, easy access to water sports and nature,” she said of the
initiative.</p>
<p>“There’s this perception that some people are not welcoming of
tourists, and that’s not the case at all,” Craig said. “It’s about
volume. It’s about too much — too many in a short period of time
overwhelming a small community.”</p>
<p>The current cruise season runs from early April to late October.</p>
<p>Opponents of the initiative say limiting dockings will hurt local
businesses that rely heavily on tourism and could invite lawsuits. A
voter-approved limit on cruise passenger numbers in Bar Harbor, Maine,
another community with a significant tourism economy, was challenged in
federal court.</p>
<p>Laura McDonnell, a business leader who owns Caribou Crossings, a gift
shop in Juneau’s downtown tourist core, said she makes 98% of her annual
revenue during the summer season.</p>
<p>Tourism is about all the “local businesses that rely on cruise
passengers and our place in the community,” said McDonnell, who is
involved in Protect Juneau’s Future, which opposes the initiative.</p>
<p>Some schools recently closed due to factors including declining
enrollment, while the regional economy faces challenges, she said.</p>
<p>“I think that as a community, we really need to look at what’s at
stake for our economy,” she said. “We are not in a position to be
shrinking our economy.”</p>
<p>The cruise industry accounted for $375 million in direct spending in
Juneau in 2023, most of that attributable to spending by passengers,
according to a report prepared for the city by McKinley Research Group
LLC.</p>
<p>After a two-year pandemic lull, cruise passenger numbers rose sharply
in Juneau, hitting a record of more than 1.6 million in 2023. Under this
year’s schedule, Sept. 21 will be the first day since early May with no
large ships in town.</p>
<p>The tourism debate is polarizing, and the city has been trying to
find a middle ground, said Alexandra Pierce, Juneau’s visitor industry
director. But she noted there also needs to be a regional solution.</p>
<p>If the Juneau initiative passes, it will impact other, smaller
communities in southeast Alaska because the ships, generally on trips
originating in Seattle or Vancouver, Canada, will have to go somewhere
if they can’t dock in Juneau on Saturdays, she said.</p>
<p>Some residents in Sitka, south of Juneau, are in the early stages of
trying to limit cruise visitation to that small, island community, which
is near a volcano.</p>
<p>Juneau and major cruise lines, including Carnival Corp., Disney
Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean Group, agreed to
a limit of five large ships a day, which took effect this year. They
more recently signed a pact, set to take effect in 2026, seeking a daily
limit of 16,000 cruise passengers Sundays through Fridays and 12,000 on
Saturdays.</p>
<p>Pierce said the overall goal is to keep total cruise passenger
visitation around 1.6 million, and to even out daily numbers of visitors
that can spike to about 18,000 on the busiest days and feel “a bit
suffocating.” Juneau traditionally has been the most popular cruise port
in the state.</p>
<p>A number of projects around Juneau are expected to help make existing
cruise numbers feel less impactful. Those include plans for a gondola at
the city-owned ski area and increased visitor capacity at the Mendenhall
Glacier recreation area, she said.</p>
<p>Renée Limoge Reeve, vice president of government and community
relations for the trade group Cruise Lines International Association
Alaska, said the agreements signed with the city were the first of their
kind in Alaska.</p>
<p>The best strategy is “ongoing, direct dialogue with local
communities” and working together in a way that also provides a
predictable source of income for local businesses, she said.</p>
<p>Protect Juneau’s Future, led by local business leaders, said the
success of the ballot measure would mean a loss of sales tax revenue and
millions of dollars in direct spending by cruise passengers. The group
was confident voters would reject the measure, its steering committee
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Karla Hart, a sponsor of the initiative and frequent critic of the
cruise industry, said the threat of litigation has kept communities from
taking steps to limit cruise numbers in the past. She was heartened by
legal wins this year in the ongoing fight over the measure passed in Bar
Harbor, a popular destination near Maine’s Acadia National Park.</p>
<p>She believes the Juneau initiative will pass.</p>

id="torrid-heat-bakes-millions-in-large-swaths-of-us-setting-records-and-fanning-wildfires">Torrid
heat bakes millions in large swaths of US, setting records and fanning
wildfires</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Las Vegas — Roughly 130 million people were under threat over the
weekend and into next week from a long-running heat wave that broke or
tied records with dangerously high temperatures and is expected to
shatter more from East Coast to West Coast, forecasters said.</p>
<p>Ukiah, north of San Francisco, hit 117 degrees Fahrenheit (47 degrees
Celsius) on Saturday, breaking the city’s record for the date and tying
its all-time high. Livermore, east of San Francisco, hit 111 F (43.8 C),
breaking the daily maximum temperature record of 109 F (42.7 C) set more
than a century ago in 1905.</p>
<p>Las Vegas tied the record of 115 F (46 C), last reached in 2007, and
Phoenix topped out at 114 F (45.5 C), just shy of the record of 116 F
(46.7 C) dating to 1942.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said it was extending the excessive heat
warning for much of the Southwest through Friday.</p>
<p>“A dangerous and historic heatwave is just getting started across the
area, with temperatures expected to peak during the Sunday-Wednesday
timeframe,” the National Weather Service in Las Vegas said in an updated
forecast.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, where the mercury hit 100 F (37.7 C) by 10:30 a.m.,
Marko Boscovich said the best way to beat the heat is in a seat at a
slot machine with a cold beer inside an air-conditioned casino.</p>
<p>“But you know, after it hits triple digits it’s about all the same to
me,” said Boscovich, who was visiting from Sparks, Nevada to see a Dead
&amp; Company concert Saturday night at the Sphere. “Maybe they’ll play
one of my favorites — ‘Cold Rain and Snow.’”</p>
<p>In more humid parts of the country, temperatures could spike above
100 F (about 38 C) in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the mid-Atlantic
and the Northeast, said Jacob Asherman, a weather service
meteorologist.</p>
<p>Heat records shattered across the Southwest</p>
<p>Meteorologists predicted that temperatures would be near daily
records in the region through most, if not all, of the coming week, with
lower desert highs reaching 115 to 120 degrees F (46.1 to 48.8 C).</p>
<p>Rare heat advisories were extended even into higher elevations
including around Lake Tahoe, on the border of California and Nevada,
with the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, warning of “major
heat risk impacts, even in the mountains.”</p>
<p>“How hot are we talking? Well, high temperatures across (western
Nevada and northeastern California) won’t get below 100 degrees (37.8 C)
until next weekend,” the service posted online. “And unfortunately,
there won’t be much relief overnight either.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Reno hit a high of 104 F (40 C) on Saturday, smashing the old
record of 101 F (38.3 C).</p>
<p>More extreme highs are in the near forecast, including 129 F (53.8 C)
for Sunday at Furnace Creek, California, in Death Valley National Park,
and then around 130 F (54.4 C) through Wednesday.</p>
<p>The hottest temperature ever officially recorded on Earth was 134 F
(56.67 C) in July 1913 in Death Valley, eastern California, though some
experts dispute that measurement and say the real record was 130 F (54.4
C), recorded there in July 2021.</p>
<p>The worst is yet to come across the West and mid-Atlantic</p>
<p>Triple-digit temperatures are likely in the West, between 15 and 30 F
(8 and 16 C) higher than average into next week, the National Weather
Service said.</p>
<p>The Eastern U.S. also was bracing for more hot temperatures.
Baltimore and others parts of Maryland were under an excessive heat
warning as heat index values could climb to 110 F (43 C), forecasters
said.</p>
<p>“Drink plenty of fluids, stay in an air-conditioned room, stay out of
the sun, and check up on relatives and neighbors,” read a National
Weather Service advisory for the Baltimore area. “Young children and
pets should never be left unattended in vehicles under any
circumstances.”</p>
<p>Deaths are starting to mount</p>
<p>In Arizona’s Maricopa County, which encompasses Phoenix, there have
been at least 13 confirmed heat-related deaths this year, along with
more than 160 other deaths suspected of being related to heat that are
still under investigation, according to a recent report.</p>
<p>That does not include the death of a 10-year-old boy last week in
Phoenix who suffered a “heat-related medical event” while hiking with
family at South Mountain Park and Preserve, according to police.</p>
<p>California wildfires fanned by low humidity, high temperatures</p>
<p>Firefighters dispatched aircraft and helicopters to drop water or
retardant on a series of wildfires in California.</p>
<p>In Santa Barbara County, northwest of Los Angeles, the Lake Fire has
scorched more than 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of grass,
brush and timber. Firefighters said the blaze was displaying “extreme
fire behavior” and had the “potential for large growth” with high
temperatures and low humidity.</p>
<p>Festival revelers meet the heat with cold water and shade</p>
<p>At the Waterfront Blues Festival in Portland, Oregon, music fans
coped by drinking cold water, seeking shade or freshening up under water
misters. Organizers of the weekend revelries also advertised free access
to air conditioning in a nearby hotel.</p>
<p>Angelica Quiroz, 31, kept her scarf and hat wet and applied
sunscreen.</p>
<p>“Definitely a difference between the shade and the sun,” Quiroz said
Friday. “But when you’re in the sun, it feels like you’re cooking.”</p>

<h2 id="nato-to-discuss-russia-north-korea-military-cooperation">NATO to
discuss Russia-North Korea military cooperation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>Washington — The NATO summit scheduled for this week will include a
discussion among the allies about strengthening security ties with South
Korea and Japan against deepening military cooperation between Russia
and North Korea, experts said.</p>
<p>The leaders of 32 NATO members will convene in Washington July 9 to
11 to discuss ways to provide continued military support to Ukraine to
help it defend itself against Russia, which invaded more than two years
ago.</p>
<p>Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea — sometimes referred to
as the Indo-Pacific 4 or IP4 — are invited to the NATO summit. The
United States, Japan and South Korea plan to meet on the sidelines of
the summit.</p>
<p>Among the items that analysts expect NATO to discuss with Japan and
South Korea is the growing military cooperation between Russia and North
Korea.</p>
<p>“The Russian-North Korean agreement is a problem for both NATO
countries and for the countries in the Northeast Asia,” said Bruce
Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation.</p>
<p>“I expect that it will be discussed at this meeting. It may become a
critical aspect of the meeting, if, by that time, intelligence is saying
that North Korea is sending many military personnel to support Russia in
Ukraine,” Bennett said.</p>
<p>After Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un signed a mutual defense pact in Pyongyang last month, some
speculated that North Korea could dispatch army engineers to
Russian-occupied Donetsk to rebuild the war-torn region.</p>
<p>Pentagon press secretary Major General Patrick Ryder said at a press
conference on June 25 that the U.S. is keeping an eye on a possible
dispatch of troops but warned North Korea about sending military forces,
saying they would be “cannon fodder in an illegal war against
Ukraine.”</p>
<p>North Korea on June 27 renewed its support for Russia’s war against
Ukraine, saying, “We will always be on the side of the Russian army” in
“the war of justice.”</p>
<p>Both Washington and Seoul have estimated that Pyongyang sent about
10,000 containers of munitions to Russia. Moscow and Pyongyang denied
arms exchanges between the two.</p>
<p>But in the defense pact that Putin and Kim signed last month, they
agreed to set up ways to bolster their defense capabilities and openly
announced possible military and technical cooperation.</p>
<p>“NATO members will discuss the implications of closer Russia-North
Korea relations and how best to respond, including in terms of risks and
opportunities,” said Matthew Brummer, a professor at the National
Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo.</p>
<p>“Risks primarily include material outcomes, such as how North Korea
involvement will come to bear on warfighting in Ukraine. But there are
also opportunities to be exploited, including how to use increased North
Korea involvement to drive a wedge between China and Russia,” he
said.</p>
<p>“The reemerging axis between China, Russia and North Korea has most
certainly precipitated the security link between Europe and Asia. As a
result, I expect increased NATO involvement in East Asia, especially
with Japan, which is the world’s greatest latent military power,”
Brummer said.</p>
<p>Beijing said that it is keeping “a close eye” on the NATO summit and
that it hopes the summit does not “target any third party.”</p>
<p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington,
told VOA on Tuesday that “the Asia-Pacific lies beyond the geographical
scope of the North Atlantic” and that “NATO’s attempt to make eastward
inroads into the Asia-Pacific will inevitably undermine regional peace
and stability.”</p>
<p>“The countries and people in this region are on high alert against
this and firmly oppose any words or actions designed to bring military
blocs into this region and stoke division and confrontation,” he
said.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department did not respond to an inquiry by VOA’s
Korean Service seeking a response to Beijing’s comments.</p>
<p>Luis Simon, director of the Elcano Royal Institute in Brussels,
Belgium, said he would not rule out NATO countries conducting joint
military exercises with its East Asian partners “in the Korean Peninsula
context rather than in a China context” because it offers
“diplomatically an easier entry point.”</p>
<p>At the same time, he said, “It will be more with NATO allies rather
than the NATO as a whole because NATO as a whole is very clear about
being laser focused” on defending Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Japan Air Self-Defense Force announced on June 25 that it will
hold a series of joint drills in July with Germany, Spain and France —
all NATO members.</p>
<p>David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific
Strategy, also said that bilateral arrangements between South Korea and
individual NATO countries could be possible as “a number of NATO
countries are member states of the United Nations Command.”</p>
<p>The U.N. Command is a multinational military body created during the
Korean War of 1950-53 to defend against North Korean aggression.</p>
<p>Some analysts said there are limits to NATO’s involvement in the
Indo-Pacific.</p>
<p>“Most of the countries in NATO are focused on the Atlantic area, and
those who have projection capabilities” that can go beyond that “have
rather small ones,” said Barry Posen, Ford international professor of
political science at MIT.</p>
<p>William Ruger, a nonresident senior fellow at Defense Priorities,
said U.S. “capabilities, material and policy bandwidth” are not
sufficient to deal with the security of both Europe and Asia.</p>

<h2
id="sizzling-sidewalks-unshaded-playgrounds-pose-risk-of-burns">Sizzling
sidewalks, unshaded playgrounds pose risk of burns</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>PHOENIX, Arizona — Ron Falk lost his right leg, had extensive skin
grafting on the left one and is still recovering a year after collapsing
on the searing asphalt outside a Phoenix convenience store where he
stopped for a cold soda during a heat wave.</p>
<p>Now using a wheelchair, the 62-year-old lost his job and his home.
He’s recovering at a medical respite center for patients with no other
place to go; there he gets physical therapy and treatment for a
bacterial infection in what remains of his right leg, which is too
swollen to use the prosthesis he’d hoped would help him walk again.</p>
<p>“If you don’t get somewhere to cool down, the heat will affect you,”
said Falk, who lost consciousness due to heat stroke. “Then you won’t
know what’s happening, like in my case.”</p>
<p>Sizzling sidewalks and unshaded playgrounds pose risks for surface
burns as air temperatures reach new summertime highs in Southwest U.S.
cities such as Phoenix, which just recorded its hottest June on record.
The average daytime high was 43 degrees Celsius (109.5 degrees
Fahrenheit), without a single 24-hour high below 37.7 Celsius (100
Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>Young children, older adults and homeless people are especially at
risk for contact burns, which can occur in seconds when skin touches a
surface of 82 C (180 F).</p>
<p>Since the beginning of June, 50 people have been hospitalized with
such burns, and four have died at Valleywise Health Medical Center in
Phoenix, which operates the Southwest’s largest burn center, serving
patients from six states, according to its director, Dr. Kevin Foster.
About 80% were injured in metro Phoenix.</p>
<p>Last year, the center admitted 136 patients for surface burns from
June through August, up from 85 during the same period in 2022, Foster
said. Fourteen died. One out of five were homeless.</p>
<p>“Last year’s record heat wave brought an alarming number of patients
with life-threatening burns,” Foster said of a 31-day period with
temperatures at or above 43 C (110 F) during Phoenix’s hottest
summer.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, which regularly sees summertime highs in the triple
digits, 22 people were hospitalized in June alone at the University
Medical Center’s Lions Burn Care Center, said spokesperson Scott Kerbs.
That’s nearly half as many as the 46 hospitalized during all three
summer months last year.</p>
<p>As in Phoenix, the desert sun punishes Las Vegas for hours every day,
frying outdoor surfaces such as asphalt, concrete and metal doors on
cars and playground equipment such as swings and monkey bars.</p>
<p>Contact with pavement</p>
<p>Surface burn victims often include children injured walking barefoot
on concrete or touching hot surfaces, adults who collapsed on a sidewalk
while intoxicated, and older people who fell on the pavement due to heat
stroke or another medical emergency.</p>
<p>Some don’t survive.</p>
<p>Thermal injuries were among the main or contributing causes of last
year’s 645 heat-related deaths in Maricopa County, which encompasses
Phoenix.</p>
<p>One victim was an 82-year-old woman with dementia and heart disease
admitted to a suburban Phoenix hospital after being found on the
scorching pavement on an August day that hit 41.1 C (106 F).</p>
<p>With a body temperature of 40.5 C (105 F), the woman was rushed to
the hospital with second-degree burns on her back and right side,
covering 8% of her body. She died three days later.</p>
<p>Many surface burn patients also suffered potentially fatal heat
stroke.</p>
<p>Valleywise hospital’s emergency department recently adopted a new
protocol for all heat stroke victims: submerging patients in a bag of
slushy ice to quickly bring down body temperature.</p>
<p>Recovery for those with skin burns was often lengthy, with patients
undergoing multiple skin grafts and other surgeries, followed by months
of recovery in skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities.</p>
<p>Bob Woolley, 71, suffered second- and third-degree burns to his
hands, arms, leg and torso after he stumbled onto the broiling backyard
rock garden at his Phoenix home while wearing only swim trunks and a
tank top.</p>
<p>“The ordeal was extremely painful; it was almost unbearable,” said
Woolley, who was hospitalized at the Valleywise burn center for several
months. He said he considers himself “95% recovered” after extensive
skin grafts and physical therapy and has resumed some former activities
such as swimming and motorcycle riding.  </p>
<p>Children among the burned</p>
<p>Some burn victims in Phoenix and Las Vegas were children.</p>
<p>“In many cases, this involves toddlers walking or crawling onto hot
surfaces,” Kerbs said of those hospitalized at the Las Vegas center.</p>
<p>Foster said about 20% of the hospitalized and outpatient skin-burn
victims seen at the Phoenix center are children.</p>
<p>Small children aren’t fully aware of the harm a sizzling metal door
handle or a scorching sidewalk can cause.</p>
<p>“Because they’re playing, they don’t pay attention,” said urban
climatologist Ariane Middel, an assistant professor at Arizona State
University who directs the SHaDE Lab, a research team that studies the
effects of urban heat.</p>
<p>“They may not even notice that it’s hot.”</p>
<p>In measuring surface temperatures of playground equipment, the team
found that in 37.7-degree C (100 F) weather without shade, a slide can
heat up to 71.1 C (160 F), but a covering can bring that down to 43.8 C
(111 F). A rubber ground cover can hit as high as 86.6 C (188 F), a
handrail can heat up to 48.8 C (120 F) and concrete can reach 55.5 C
(132 F).</p>
<p>Many metro Phoenix parks have covered picnic tables and plastic
fabric stretched over play equipment, keeping metal or plastic surfaces
up to 30 degrees Fahrenheit cooler. But plenty do not, Middel said.</p>
<p>She said cooler wood chips are better underfoot than rubber mats,
which were designed to protect kids from head injuries but soak up heat
in the broiling sun. Like rubber, artificial turf gets hotter than
asphalt.</p>
<p>“We need to think about alternative surface types, because most
surfaces we use for our infrastructure are heat sponges,” Middel
said.</p>
<p>Pets in danger, too</p>
<p>Hot concrete and asphalt also pose burn risks for pets.</p>
<p>Veterinarians recommend dogs wear booties to protect their paws
during outdoor walks in summer or keeping them on cooler grassy areas.
Owners are also advised to make sure their pets drink plenty of water
and don’t get overheated. Phoenix bans dogs from the city’s popular
hiking trails on days the National Weather Service issues an excessive
heat warning.</p>
<p>Recovering at Phoenix’s Circle the City, a respite care facility he
was sent to after being released from Valleywise’s burn unit, Falk said
he never imagined the Phoenix heat could cause him to collapse on the
broiling asphalt in his shorts and T-shirt.</p>
<p>Because he wasn’t carrying identification or a phone, no one knew
where he was for months. He has a long road ahead but still hopes to
regain part of his old life, working for a concessionaire for
entertainment events.</p>
<p>“I kind of went into a downward spiral,” Falk said. “I finally woke
up and said, ’Hey, wait, I lost a leg.’ But that doesn’t mean you’re
useless.”</p>

id="north-dakota-tribe-goes-back-to-its-roots-with-a-massive-greenhouse-operation">North
Dakota tribe goes back to its roots with a massive greenhouse
operation</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>BISMARCK, North Dakota — A Native American tribe in North Dakota will
soon grow lettuce in a giant greenhouse complex that when fully
completed will be among the country’s largest, enabling the tribe to
grow much of its own food decades after a federal dam flooded the land
where they had cultivated corn, beans and other crops for millennia.</p>
<p>Work is ongoing on the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation’s
1.3-hectare greenhouse that will make up most of the Native Green Grow
operation’s initial phase. However, enough of the structure will be
completed this summer to start growing leafy greens and other crops such
as tomatoes and strawberries.</p>
<p>“We’re the first farmers of this land,” Tribal Chairman Mark Fox
said. “We once were part of an Aboriginal trade center for thousands and
thousands of years because we grew crops — corn, beans, squash,
watermelons — all these things at massive levels, so all the tribes
depended on us greatly as part of the Aboriginal trade system.”</p>
<p>The tribe will spend roughly $76 million on the initial phase, which
also will include a warehouse and other facilities near the tiny town of
Parshall. It plans to add to the growing space in the coming years,
eventually totaling about 5.9 hectares, which officials say would make
it one of the world’s largest facilities of its type.</p>
<p>The tribe’s fertile land along the Missouri River was inundated in
the mid-1950s when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Garrison
Dam, which created Lake Sakakawea.</p>
<p>Getting fresh produce has long been a challenge in the area of
western North Dakota where the tribe is based, on the Fort Berthold
Indian Reservation. The rolling, rugged landscape — split by Lake
Sakakawea — is a long drive from the state’s biggest cities, Bismarck
and Fargo.</p>
<p>That isolation makes the greenhouses all the more important, as they
will enable the tribe to provide food to the roughly 8,300 people on the
Fort Berthold reservation and to reservations elsewhere. The tribe also
hopes to stock food banks that serve isolated and impoverished areas in
the region, and plans to export its produce.</p>
<p>Initially, the MHA Nation expects to grow nearly 907,000 kilograms of
food a year and for that to eventually increase to 5.4 million to 6.4
million kilograms annually. Fox said the operation’s first phase will
create 30 to 35 jobs.</p>
<p>The effort coincides with a national move to increase food
sovereignty among tribes.</p>
<p>Supply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic led tribes
nationwide to use federal coronavirus aid to invest in food systems,
including underground greenhouses in South Dakota to feed the local
community, said Heather Dawn Thompson, director of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture’s Office of Tribal Relations. In Oklahoma, multiple
tribes are running or building their own meat processing plant, she
said.</p>
<p>The USDA promotes its Indigenous Food Sovereignty Initiative, which
“really challenges us to think about food and the way we do business at
USDA from an Indigenous, tribal lens,” Thompson said. Examples include
Indigenous seed hubs, foraging videos and guides, cooking videos and a
meat processing program for Indigenous animals.</p>
<p>“We have always been a very independent, sovereign people that have
been able to hunt, gather, grow and feed ourselves, and forces have
intervened over the last century that have disrupted those independent
food resources, and it made it very challenging. But the desire and goal
has always been there,” said Thompson, whose tribal affiliation is
Cheyenne River Sioux.</p>
<p>The MHA Nation’s greenhouse plans are possible in large part because
of access to potable water and natural gas resources.</p>
<p>The natural gas released in North Dakota’s Bakken oil field has long
been seen by critics as a waste and environmental concern, but Fox said
the tribal nation intends to capture and compress that gas to heat and
power the greenhouse and process into fertilizer.</p>
<p>Flaring, in which natural gas is burned off from pipes that emerge
from the ground, has been a longtime issue in the No. 3 oil-producing
state.</p>
<p>North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad said that
key to capturing the gas is building needed infrastructure, as the MHA
Nation intends to do.</p>
<p>“With those operators that are trying to get to that level of zero,
it’s certainly going to take more infrastructure, more buildout of
pipes, processing plants, all of the above to stay on top of this
issue,” he said.</p>
<p>The Fort Berthold Reservation had nearly 3,000 active wells in April,
when oil production totaled 203,000 barrels a day on the reservation.
Oil production has helped the MHA Nation build schools, roads, housing
and medical facilities, Fox said.</p>

<h2 id="ready-to-come-out-scientists-emerge-after-year-on-mars">‘Ready
to come out?’ Scientists emerge after year ‘on Mars’</h2>
<p>date: 2024-07-07, from: VOA News USA</p>
<p>washington — The NASA astronaut knocks loudly three times on what
appears to be a nondescript door and calls cheerfully: “You ready to
come out?” </p>
<p>The reply is inaudible, but beneath his mask he appears to be
grinning as he yanks the door open, and four scientists who have spent a
year away from all other human contact, simulating a mission to Mars,
spill out to cheers and applause. </p>
<p>Anca Selariu, Ross Brockwell, Nathan Jones and team leader Kelly
Haston have spent the past 378 days sealed inside the “Martian” habitat
in Houston, Texas, part of NASA’s research into what it will take to put
humans on the Red Planet.  </p>
<p>They have been growing vegetables, conducting “Marswalks,” and
operating under what NASA terms “additional stressors,” such as
communication delays with “Earth,” including their families; isolation
and confinement.  </p>
<p>It’s the kind of experience that would make anyone who lived through
pandemic lockdowns shudder, but all four were beaming as they reemerged
Saturday, their hair slightly more unruly and their emotion apparent.
 </p>
<p>“Hello. It’s actually so wonderful just to be able to say hello to
you,” Haston, a biologist, said with a laugh. </p>
<p>“I really hope I don’t cry standing up here in front of all of you,”
Jones, an emergency room doctor, said as he took to the microphone, and
nearly doing just that several moments later as he spotted his wife in
the crowd.  </p>
<p>The habitat, dubbed Mars Dune Alpha, is a 3D-printed,
160-square-meter facility, complete with bedrooms, a gym, common areas,
and a vertical farm for growing food. </p>
<p>An outdoor area, separated by an airlock, is filled with red sand and
is where the team donned suits to conduct their “Marswalks,” though it
is still covered rather than being open air. </p>
<p>“They have spent more than a year in this habitat conducting crucial
science, most of it nutrition-based and how that impacts their
performance … as we prepare to send people on to the Red Planet,” Steve
Koerner told the crowd. Koerner is the deputy director at NASA’s Johnson
Space Center. </p>
<p>“I’m very appreciative,” he added. </p>
<p>This mission is the first of a series of three planned by NASA,
grouped under the title CHAPEA — Crew Health and Performance Exploration
Analog. </p>
<p>A yearlong mission simulating life on Mars took place in 2015-2016 in
a habitat in Hawaii, and although NASA participated in it, it was not at
the helm. </p>
<p>Under its Artemis program, America plans to send humans back to the
Moon to learn how to live there long-term to help prepare a trip to
Mars, sometime towards the end of the 2030s.</p>
